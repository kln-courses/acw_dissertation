<plain_text><page sequence="1">MODERN WORK ON EARWIGS By MALCOLM BURR, D.Sc., F.R.Ent.S. I. Their Ancestors The Dermaptera, or Earwigs, in spite of several highly specialised features, are an archaic and generalised type of insect. The earliest known fossil with any claim to be regarded as an earwig is from the Lower Permian of Kansas, where have been pre- served wings with the characteristic folding. On the strength of these Tillyard formed a distinct order of insects, the Elytroptera , which he considered ancestral to the Dermaptera. Not all, however, accept this judgment. For the next step we must go to Asia. In shales of Jurassic age in Kazakstan two kinds of fossil have been found which have reasonable claim to be regarded as the remains of earwigs. No living form seems to represent the line of one, Semenoviola , which is no doubt extinct. The other is well named Paradiplatys fortis , as it is in many ways reminiscent of the primitive genus Diplatys. The fact that the cerci are segmented is no serious objection, as seg- mented cerci survive in larvae of Diplatyinœ and Karschiellinœ. A more serious objection is in the five-segmented tarsi. This, how- ever, is not insuperable, as the ancestral forms of the related Orthop- tera were pentamerous. Moreover, the number of tarsal segments is not immutable, as different numbers occur in related groups and instances of hypotypy are by no means rare. There are several other ancestral features, but only one, the apparent venation of the elytra, has completely disappeared in all recent forms. Remains from Mesozoic beds claimed as those of earwigs must be accepted with caution, but we meet with unquestioned Dermap- tera in the early Tertiary. Many years ago Scudder described about a dozen species, for which he created the genus Labiduromma, from lacustrine shales of early Tertiary age from Florissant, in Colorado ; and from Baltic amber, reputed to be of Lower Oligocene age, several species are known. These are of modern appearance, and Bey-Bienko has pointed out the resemblance of two to several existing species. 20</page><page sequence="2">MODERN WORK ON EARWIGS 21 II. Geographical Distribution There are something more than 900 species of earwigs known to science, the great majority of which are confined to the tropics. No less than 400 are recorded from the Oriental Region alone. Many more must remain to be discovered in Africa and especially in South America. The numbers drop rapidly towards the temper- ate zones. In the Palsearctic Region there are known about 90 species and in the Nearctic there are no indigenous earwigs at all. It is interesting to compare the 9 species of Russia with 45 in the Mediterranean and 75 in the Belgian Congo. Earwigs are hygrophilous insects, loving a warm, and above all, moist atmosphere ; aridity is fatal to them. So it seems likely that the cause of the extinction of Labiduromma was the desiccation of the Western United States, and no doubt the glaciation exterminated any other Dermaptera that may have lived in other parts of North America. That in pre-glacial days it shared the forficuline fauna of the now temperate Old World is indicated by the curious survival in the mountains of Mexico of Anechura vara Scudd., an isolated species of a genus characteristic of high altitudes in Central Asia and Europe. Presumably the genus was once holarctic in distribution and this single species survived in the New World in the south, having migrated along the higher crests. The only other earwigs known to-day in North America are either immigrants from the Neo- tropical Region or naturalised aliens. It is curious that the almost cosmopolitan Labidura riparia Pall, appears to be unknown on the west coast. In the Old World we find in the temperate belt two dominant genera, both high in the scale of development and closely related to each other, Forficula and Anechura . The former, associated with woodlands, contains about 50 species, three-quarters of which are found only in the Palaearctic Region. The latter contains 18 species, almost confined to the region, with the Mexican exception alluded to. In the West we have respectively 14 and 6 species of these two genera, while in the East there are 12 of Anechura and 20 of Forficula so far known. In the centre there are but two of each. This striking discontinuous distribution, of which analogous cases are known to most zoologists, is explained by the extermination of the ancient fauna of the centre owing to the drying-up of Asia consequent upon the elevation of the mountains to the south, which curtained off oceanic moisture. The survivors in the West were then drastically affected by the</page><page sequence="3">22 SCIENCE PROGRESS Pleistocene glaciation, but in the Far East the ancient fauna has to a great extent survived under favourable conditions. The varied relief of the mountains and ravines of Szechuan, lower Han Su and Eastern Tibet, as Semenov-Tian-Shansky has pointed out, afford us a living picture of the ancient fauna and flora of Miocene days, when the moist, warm forest extended from the Pacific to the Atlantic. The occurrence of the panda, Ailurus , in Eastern Tibet and the Red Crag of Norfolk is analogous to the close resemblance between the members of the genus Forficula in China and Western Europe. Both phenomena are due to the same cause. Semenov-Tian-Shansky and Bey-Bienko have pointed out the close relationship between the Western and Eastern species. In many instances they occur in corresponding pairs. Thus, our com- mon Western Forficula auricularia L., which extends no farther east than Kopet Dagh in Transcaucasia, is represented in the Far East by three closely related species, F. vicarìa Sem., F. burriana Sem., and F. subauricularia Sem. Similarly, the Levantine F. 8mymeri8Ì8 Serv. is paired with the Eastern F. davidi Burr ; the Russian F. tomis Kol. with the Japanese F . robusta Sem. and the Chinese F. macrobaMs B.-B. The genus Anechura underwent a somewhat similar fate. The elevation of the mountains led to the evolution of species by isolation. The Italian A. orsinii Géné pairs with the Chinese A . svenhedini B.-B., and the Pontic subgenus Borelliola with the Tibetan Burriola. In this genus we can detect character-gradients or clines. It is significant that two of the most primitive of recent members of the genus Forficula , namely F. davidi Burr and F . schlagintweiti Burr, occur in China and the Himalayas respectively. As far back as 1910 I pointed out certain Anechurine features in the latter plastic species, which Bey-Bienko now regards with F. davidi as representing the ancestral line of the two genera. He has also called attention to the resemblance of F. schlagintweiti to the Oligocene F . prœcursor Burr, from Baltic amber. To come nearer home, it is interesting to ask whence we received that abundant insect, the Common Earwig, Forficula auricularia L. I am strongly of opinion that it is a survivor of that ancient, rich fauna of Miocene days, which ranged from ocean to ocean. It does not dread the cold. It conducts its domestic affairs in Central Europe during the winter. It ranges as far north as latitude 60°. Its close relative, F. tomis Kol., can stand even the Russian winter as far north as Vitebsk and Omsk, where it hibernates in the larval stage. It is rather the humidity than the cold that was fatal to so much life in the days of the glaciation, and against that earwigs are</page><page sequence="4">MODERN WORK ON EARWIGS 23 protected by their secluded life and hygrophilous disposition. Eloquent evidence in support of my view is the identification by Lesne of the pronotum of a common earwig from the Pliocene of Castle Eden, in co. Durham. Dr. Zeuner will not accept this view. He considers that the species may certainly have lived with us in those days, but that it could not have survived the glaciation and that the ancestors of our present earwigs came over from the Con- tinent during that relatively short period between the retreat of the glaciers and our separation from the mainland. But if it is correct that the hippopotamus survived in the valley of the Rhine well into the Pleistocene and in England into the Middle, and even Upper Pleistocene, lingering in our oceanic climate for some 200,000 years after its disappearance from Germany (v. article in Nature , June 20, 1936, p. 1041), why should not our damp-loving, cold- resisting earwig have survived down to our own day ? Another somewhat obscure point in the geographical distribution of earwigs is worth bringing into prominence. There is a small but very sharply defined subfamily called Esphalmeninœ. The shape of the sternal plates and the peculiar form of the male genital arma- ture separate it very clearly from all other groups. There are about half a dozen species, all apterous, well flattened, with strongly dilated abdomen, and all dark in colour, features characteristic of high altitudes. It is not surprising, therefore, that the single genus occurs in the Andes, from Patagonia to Ecuador, but it is surprising that one species is known only from the Caledon River in Cape Colony, where it was discovered by the late L. Péringuey many years ago. This remarkable instance of discontinuous distribution is, I think, the chief contribution of the Dermaptera in support of the hypothesis of continental drift. III. The Senses of Earwigs As earwigs are lovers of the dark, it is not surprising to find that they draw their perception of the world rather from touch than from sight. Their eyes are of the type termed acone. That is, instead of the optical elements called cones occurring in most faceted insect eyes, there is merely a group of elongate transparent cells. This somewhat primitive type of eye is found also in the Tipulidœ or Daddy- Long-Legs and in some Bugs and Beetles. The long " crystal cells " cannot form an image, and we can think only that they have a concentrating and directing effect upon the pencil of rays received from the corneal lens. The picture must be formed by the massing of such specks of light, in a manner analogous to that of the half-</page><page sequence="5">24 SCIENCE PROGRESS tone plate. It is therefore hardly surprising that Weyrauch found poor reaction to optical stimuli. The range of clear vision in such an eye, in his opinion, is not more than 1 centimetre. Earwigs are negatively phototropic and react more quickly to all stimuli in the dark than in a bright light. The dominant stimulus is tactile, for it takes but the slightest unevenness of surface on which the insect is standing to enable it to orientate itself. The antennae are particularly sensitive to such stimuli. These are in a state of almost perpetual motion, testing the environment during movement and even when at rest in a crevice the insect maintains contact with the walls around it by means of its antennae. If one be amputated, the function is carried out by the other. The behaviour of the antennae can be easily seen in a specimen in a glass tube of small diameter, when the earwig will maintain contact with the walls of the tube by means of its antennae. If placed in a vessel with curved walls, the earwig will crouch as close as possible to the wall, its body bending to fit the curve. If then disturbed, instead of crawling or flying away, it will cling all the more closely to the wall. This reaction is very characteristic of the earwigs, which always seek to maintain con- tact, preferably dorsal, with some solid, fixed object. This accounts for their preference to narrow crevices. Earwigs are in fact thigmo- tactic and such a reaction can be stronger even than the negative phototropism, marked though that be in these insects. There is certainly connection between this thigmotropism and their gregari- ous habits. In everyday language, we should say that they derive a feeling of comfort from the contact of their kind. Earwigs respond also to various chemical stimuli, as can be seen in their discrimination between a sound egg and a rotten one (v. inf., p. 29). The seat of perception of such stimuli is no doubt in the antennae and palpi, which are studded with minute sense organs. Weyrauch found earwigs a suitable subject for experiments in hypnosis. They have insensitive callipers by which they can be handled with a minimum of disturbance ; they are abundant, and in nature not much exposed to such stimuli as be applied. He found that by the excitement of a fixed point in the central nervous system there was formed, as a counter-reaction against further excitement of the ganglion cells concerned, a localised stage of fatigue, an inhibition. This inhibition radiates from the point of origin and involves other regions of the central nervous system in sympathy. Such a far-reaching inhibition, involving akinesis, he terms hypnosis. Weyrauch points out that in this conclusion he agrees with Mangold in Jena, with Bobimarga in Italy who worked</page><page sequence="6">MODERN WORK ON EARWIGS 25 with birds and mammals, with Ten Cate in Holland who worked with Raja clavata , the thornback skate, and with Pavlov in Russia who worked with dogs. Starting from the fact that the earwig is most sensitive to tactile stimuli, he held one by the callipers and gently pulled it backwards for a distance of about 20 cm., across a sheet of paper and then lifted it suddenly into the air. The insect put up a resistance by clawing that was appreciable. The effect of lifting it was instant immobility. Another method is to hold down the head and antennae gently with the finger. This activates the defence reflex, and the insect raises its tail backwards, but as the pinch reflex cannot be satisfied, the abdomen drops and remains immobile. He found six other methods by which he could induce akinesis. The difficulty is to avoid shock to the nervous system and such counter-irritations as exposure to draught, shaking, or contact where not actually desired, all of which spoil the effect. He observed a transitional stage before immobility was reached. The duration depends on the method employed. Naturally, the deeper and longer the hypnosis, the slower the recovery. He modi- fied the first method by waxing the tarsi, so that the claws slipped over the paper. Like this, mere contact without resistence was enough to induce the condition, though not so effectively. Weyrauch found no difference in the reaction of the sexes and that none was refractory. The condition of akinesis lasts for a period varying from a few seconds to half an hour. His record was 1 hour 27 minutes 23 seconds. IV. Variation in the Length of the Forceps The marked variation in the length of the callipers of the male earwig has long attracted the attention of biologists. In 1892 Bateson and Brindley found evidence of a partially discontinuous variation in this secondary sexual character. They found that the male earwigs fall into two well-marked groups, those with short forceps and those with long. The shortest measured 2-5 mm., the longest 9 mm. Plotted to the millimetre, these were found to be grouped around 3-5 mm. and 7 mm., thus forming two peaks, a bimodal polygon. This conclusion was accepted without hesitation, and the terms " high " and " low " males passed into current phraseology in the literature of the order. But these results have been challenged by Willi Kuhl, who criticised the methods of the English observers. They measured 583 males, to approximately 0-5 mm. He handled 1 1,630 specimens, and measured to tenths of millimetres : they measured the length</page><page sequence="7">26 SCIENCE PROGRESS only ; he measured ten dimensions and ratios : they handled only males ; he handled both sexes and also a large number of malformed specimens : they plotted one graph only ; he plotted dozens, and also made models in the solid. His main criticism was against their method of collection, which resulted only in a thousand specimens, from which they selected the males. He maintains that the ideal material to measure is the entire population of the species in a given spot, in two or more seasons. Only then are the proportions true. He approached this ideal in his collecting ground in Heligoland and somewhat less closely at Frankfurt am Main. At a locality in Holstein conditions were less favourable, and the relatively small collection from there was the only one which gave a sign of a second peak. He also collected in two successive seasons. From this thorough method he drew definite conclusions. So far from there being very few specimens of intermediate length, as was hitherto firmly believed, he found the passage from the shortest to the longest imperceptible. The variation is so great that he scarcely found two specimens alike. There are not two peaks, but only one. The terms " high " and " low " must go. Kuhl's method was so thorough and the scale on which he worked so big, that there can be no question that his conclusions must override those both of Bateson and Brindley and of Diakonov. He reveals one new and interesting form of variation. He found a certain proportion of the forceps notably broader than the rest and in these the tips do not meet, as they do in the slender forms. He showed that the largest males arise from the best-nourished and most-vigorous larvae, but if at the critical moment of the last ecdysis from some external cause the pressure of the hsemolymph is inadequate completely to inflate the still soft forceps, they do not attain their full length. The scene is set for what we used to term the " high " or macrolabious form, but development is arrested. In other words, the short broad type with gaping tips is pathological in origin. Correlative to this result is his statement that the varia- tion in the forceps depends entirely upon environmental conditions and never upon racial, hereditary causes. Such influences may be internal, as the amount of nourishment absorbed during larval life, that is to say physiological, as Julian Huxley has suggested ; or they may be external and physical, when due to wounds. There is much of interest and importance in Kuhl's work, which is worth careful attention. V. Maternal Care The construction of a nest by the mother earwig, her care of her</page><page sequence="8">MODERN WORK ON EARWIGS 27 eggs, and even of the young larvae have been a commonplace of books on insects ever since first described by de Geer in 1756. It is, in truth, a remarkable phenomenon, almost if not quite unique among insects, to be fairly compared only with the domestic activities of the truly social groups. It has won the mother earwig a certain regard and does, in fact, really look like an instance of true solicitude, so that an observer may be pardoned for crediting the insect with affection and even sentiment of duty. This anthropomorphic view, however, fades in the cold light of scientific enquiry, such as has been carried out by Weyrauch, who shows in a convincing manner that the entire series of phenomena can be accounted for by reflexes and tropisms. In temperate Europe the common earwig is single-brooded, the larvae hatching in the spring. They are gregarious and this characteristic survives the last ecdysis, which occurs early in August. Consequently it is by no means rare to find assemblages of several hundreds hiding in suitable crannies, such as crevices in old posts. Sexual maturity is reached about September, which results in promiscuous intercourse, perhaps with temporary alliances, which lasts till about the end of October, when males and females pair off. After November such colonies no longer occur. The insects are then to be found in holes in the ground, but only in pairs. From Decem- ber to February Weyrauch found seventeen nests with solitary females in them and sixty-two with a male and female but no eggs. In sixteen of these he marked the males by clipping their wings. On February 1 he opened the nests, and found eleven of the marked males still in them. Clearly monogamy obtains from November until oviposition. At the first sign of impending oviposition the mother begins to dig a hole or to improve an existing one, in which to spend the winter and rear her brood. She brings out the pellets of earth in her mandibles and drops them outside the mouth of the hole. This is from 2 to 3 inches deep, usually in some sheltered but moist situation. Occasionally she excavates a branch tunnel in the upper portion, sloping upwards, which ensures drainage, at the end of which she lays her eggs. Out of many hundreds of nests examined, three were of this design. The two essential conditions for her nest are (a) a minimum number of tactile contacts to satisfy her thigmotropism, and (6) a definite range of humidity. Excess of moisture, however, is more dangerous to the eggs than aridity. From the moment she starts excavating her nest, the defence instinct is evoked, and she will attack any moving object that</page><page sequence="9">28 SCIENCE PROGRESS appears near her work. She tests it with her antennae, as though to locate it, and then swings round and nips with her forceps. This is very like the ordinary defence of a non-maternal earwig, but definitely more energetic. The fighting technique in the common earwig is stated to be poor. Goe writes that in the United States it is preyed upon by a Cicindelid beetle and by Staphylinidœ. Yet Fuller saw one drive away a big and active Carabus, and that curious isolated species Anatœlia canariensis I. Bol. is a formidable carnivore, for Escalera saw it successfully attack such dangerous enemies as young Mantids. The most striking manifestation of this instinct is the expulsion of the male from the nest as soon as eggs are laid. To the mother he is not different from any other moving object, but the effect is to save the eggs from being devoured by the father. It is to be noted that no instance has been recorded of a male successfully defending himself against this divorce. The stimulus which activates the oviposition and this marked instinct of defence is no doubt the rising temperature of the ground. In the wild state oviposition may begin in December, but as a rule it does not occur till January, culminating in February and ceasing in March. The rhythm of oviposition varies considerably, but is constant for each individual. One may lay an egg every two hours, while another may lay six in an hour. The maximum clutch recorded is seventy, fecundity remarkable in an insect less than an inch in length. The average clutch seems to lie between forty and sixty. If the nest be disturbed or become too wet or two dry, the earwig will abandon it and make another in a better site. She generally carries the eggs across in her mandibles, one by one, to the new nest. This involves a frequent journeying to and fro. Weyrauch placed a female on a perfectly flat surface of beaten mud which gave no distinctive point of contact. Then he pricked out a path in such a way that, once the insect had accustomed herself to the road he could at will make her follow any direction he wished. This transportation of the eggs from the old to the new nest is closely connected with the instinct for re-assembling the eggs if they are scattered. Weyrauch noticed that when a heap of eggs was spread over a space of 8 or 10 inches, she collected them first into little provisional heaps, and then assembled these into one. She appears to work by trial and error. The appearance of the first egg marks the crisis in her life. It brings into action two remarkable instincts. One, to lick eggs, her own or any strange eggs put before her : the other, if the eggs are scattered, to reassemble them into a heap.</page><page sequence="10">MODERN WORK ON EARWIGS 29 The instinct to lick eggs is stronger than the instinct to eat them. Before her first laying, she would devour any egg as regardlessly as would the male. Very occasionally a hungry female will eat the first few of her own eggs, but the licking instinct quickly overcomes. The effect of this licking and turning is the disinfection of the egg by the removal of the spores of fungi or other deleterious matter. This is the most important item in the whole equipment of the maternal instinct, for observation on several species has shown that eggs rot and become mildewed unless licked daily. But for this licking, earwigs would become extinct in a single generation. In such hygrophilous insects, the eggs are always exposed to a damp atmosphere without ventilation. In Ceylon, Green observed a Diplatys rolling and licking her eggs. As Diplatys is at one end of the scale of classification and Forficula at the other end, this observa- tion suggests that this vital instinct is common throughout the order, regardless of latitude. The eggs are highly susceptible to infection by fungus, for many are spoilt in spite of the mother's attention. They are not discriminate. When Weyrauch placed eggs of spiders before a mother, and even globules of wax, she treated them in the same way as her own eggs. The requisite conditions are size, rotundity and surface. If he roughed the surface of the wax eggs with a pin, they were rejected. Clearly, the stimulus in this instinct is tactile. There is, however, also a chemical stimulus, for the foreign eggs are eventually rejected during the continued process of licking and cleaning. This stimulus dominates the tactile, as bad eggs are at once destroyed, although the superficial conditions remain unaltered. If several broody females are put together, their mutual attitude is hostile. There ensues keen competition for the possession of the eggs, in which the strongest female always ends in collecting all the eggs into a single heap, which she defends successfully against the rest. The larva hatch about three weeks or a month after oviposition. Out of a total of four moults, the first two take place in the nest. The gregarious instinct is so strong that if they are scattered during the night, in the morning they will be found all asleep together in a pile. The mother is still useful to them for defence against intruders, but when she has completed her term and died, her body is still of use to the larvae, for they eat her, just as they eat their own cast skins. Eggs taken away from the mother as soon as laid change colour quickly and become mouldy. This change of colour releases the eating instinct, for in that case the mother devours them at once. If she be separated from her eggs for a certain time, the maternal</page><page sequence="11">30 SCIENCE PROGRESS instinct with all its separate actions and expressions is lost for good. It is a remarkable fact that all these manifestations of the maternal instinct, the digging of the nest, the defence of the home and brood, the re-assembly of scattered eggs, all are lost if the master-instinct of licking be checked. Once that has gone, it cannot be restored. When that has happened any eggs placed before her are at once devoured. There is a transition period, varying from one to four days, during which there is a conflict between the two instincts. When Weyrauch placed an egg before a mother during this period, she picked it up in her mouth, turned it over two or three times, and licked it. Then suddenly the movements of her mouth-parts began tö slow down and finally ceased. She waited then for a period from ten minutes to half an hour in a state of indecision, retaining the egg in her mouth. Then suddenly the mouth parts began to move again, either to clean or ... to eat. The maternal care may be prolonged as much as three months by substituting fresh eggs for newly hatched larvae. This shows that the care of the brood is not dependent upon a hereditary fixed period, but upon the continuous presence of the necessary stimuli. VI. Does the Common Earwig Fly ? Although the common earwig rejoices in the possession of the most highly specialised wing in the insect world, its power of flight has been repeatedly questioned. As long ago as 1839 Westwood found it necessary to bring forward " proof of their flying," which he did by describing some 50 specimens caught on palings freshly coated with pitch, to which some of them had their expanded wings still adhering. Yet in 1917 Dr. Karl Verhoeff seriously questioned their power on purely theoretical grounds and dismissed records of their flight as unsatisfactory or unscientific. Two years later Mr. H. R. A. Mallock, F.R.S., queried their power, also on theoretical grounds, and quite recently L. Chopard, in his fine work La Biologie des Orthoptères, still declares himself unconvinced. But all this theorising is superfluous, as there is abundant proof not only that the common earwig can fly, but that it does so fre- quently. Sir Edward Poulton has collected a number of instances, mainly indirect it is true, of mass flight, and a string of instances by entomologists of high standing of individuals flying. This has been confirmed by several writers in German reviews, of which the most interesting is the record of Herr Richter, who on a warm September afternoon in fifteen minutes saw fourteen earwigs flying in the sun.</page></plain_text>
