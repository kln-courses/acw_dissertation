Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1991 (1994). x + 298 pp. 1. Introduction The rapid progress made in cognitive studies has already influenced a number of disciplines-including psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, anthropology, computer science, and pedagogy -and is now providing a strong incentive to redraw traditional disciplinary boundaries. For cognitive science to find a place as a humanistic discipline, other disci- plines will have to be displaced or reshaped, territories and hierarchies reassigned, emphases and boundaries shifted. Mark Turner's book con- tributes to this ongoing process. The rise of any new paradigm generally follows a predictable and famil- iar course, marked by specific ways of reasoning and rhetorical strategies. As its proponents work toward establishing it, certain contradictions result from the superimposition of two different narratives about what is happen- ing: the "upheaval" version and the "shift" version of paradigm replace- ment. The first strategy involves disparaging current paradigms, whose limitations and failures are described vividly. The new paradigm, in this view, will provide answers to open questions, solutions to as yet unsolved problems. Typically, the new paradigm is touted as more comprehensive than anything offered before, is presented as devoid of weaknesses or short- Poetics Today 18:2 (Summer 1997).

In short, a case is made for throwing out the un- satisfactory old and ushering in the promising new. The more moderate second strategy likewise praises the new paradigm for its comprehensiveness, but instead of rendering previous approaches and methods superfluous, it invites their contributions, assigning them the status of subordinate collaborators and generously offering them a role in the common enterprise, albeit from a less privileged or prestigious posi- tion. Regardless of whether this invitation is sincere or merely a token ges- ture intended to disarm the competition and forestall possible resistance, the new paradigm is portrayed as subsuming rather than superseding older ones, lending them a legitimacy that they previously lacked, and graciously accepting their contributions while compensating for their deficiencies. Mark Turner's most recent book, Reading Minds: The Study of English in the Age of Cognitive Science, fits into this pattern with its rhetoric and its contradictions. Its subsequent release as a paperback (in 1994) attests to the attention it has been accorded. The book is remarkable both for what it addresses and for what it omits. It is profoundly ambitious and curiously limited all at once. 2. Cognitivism and Literature To date, the contributions of cognitive science to the study of literature and language have been concentrated in three areas: 1. cognitive reading research, with major contributions by Patricia Car- penter, Marcel Just, Alexander Pollatsek, and Keith Rayner (see, for example, Just and Carpenter 1987; Rayner and Pollatsek 1989); 2. research into narrative structure and discourse comprehension, pio- neered by Walter Kintsch, Teun van Dijk, David Rumelhart, Roger Schank and Robert Abelson, and Anthony Sanford and Simon Gar- rod (see Rumelhart 1975, 1977, 1980; Schank and Abelson 1977; San- ford and Garrod 1981; van Dijk and Kintsch 1983; van Dijk 1985); 3. cognitive study of concepts and language (Lakoff and Johnson 1980; Johnson-Laird 1983; Lakoff 1987; Johnson 1987; Jackendoff 1987; Lloyd 1989). Turner belongs in the last category. In Reading Minds he follows up on and elaborates his own previous work (1987) as well as that of George Lakoff (with whom he coauthored More than Cool Reason [1989]) and Mark Johnson. But while this book continues his previous work's strong empha- sis on metaphors, the subtitle indicates the new scope to which it aspires:</page><page sequence="3">Gross * Cognitive Readings 273 The Study of English in the Age of Cognitive Science presents the advent of cog- nitive science as the beginning of a new era. The very first sentence of the book touts "the coming age" as "the age in which the human mind was discovered" (vii), and Turner affirms this stance by claiming that "our age stands at the threshold of discovering the mind" (16). These statements ignore the past with a certain arrogance. A sense of history and perspec- tive would suggest that this honor should belong-or at least be shared with-the Enlightenment, which discovered the human mind in its own way within its scientific-philosophical investigations of human intellectual and perceptual faculties and capabilities.' In addition to this broad empha- sis on the human mind, Turner also offers in his "Pretext" a fundamen- tal reassessment of the discipline of English (which is similarly relevant for foreign literatures and languages, although Turner does not mention them), combining a somewhat biased, if frequently insightful, overview of its present state with a master plan for its future (he returns to the role of the profession in chapter io). Overall, the sweeping "Pretext" and the following two chapters, which instruct the reader how to deal with the information provided subsequently, establish a comprehensive and ambi- tious framework within which Turner offers four chapters that treat what he calls "case studies" (of such phenomena as symmetry and the structure of arguments) and three chapters on "the poetry of connections." Turner's premises amount to a resituating of the study of literature. His argument, while not entirely new, is compelling. Rather than assign to lit- erature a special place--removed from everyday language and thought, safely ensconced in the canon-Turner proposes to ground the humani- ties, including the study of language and literature, in the study of human cognition. We might represent his model (48-49, 52) as a set of nesting circles, where each circle is the foundation for the next level. At the most general level, we find the realm of the human mind, which in turn encom- passes everyday thought and language. Within that domain of the every- day, literature or poetic thought is situated. Turner rejects any attempt at a categorical distinction between the lan- guage of literature and everyday language. His approach accords with the 1. The course of epistemological inquiry begins with Descartes, who famously based his definition of human existence on the ability to think; subsequent thinkers in this field in- clude Spinoza, Locke, Leibniz, Berkeley, Hume, Montaigne, Wolff, Kant, and Hegel. (For an overview see Ritter 1971: s.v. "Geist" [mind] and "Aufklarung" [Enlightenment]; on En- lightenment epistemology see also Brandt 1992.) It is certainly not accidental that Dennett opens his ambitious study of human consciousness with a double reference to Descartes (1991: xi, 3), whose mind-body dualism he subsequently seeks to refute using the cognitive paradigm (see chap. 2 for an overview).</page><page sequence="4">274 Poetics Today 18:2 by now generally accepted view of literary language as a special case of ordinary language marked by shifts of emphasis and differences in func- tion from everyday language, rather than by any essential otherness (see Fish 1980). Turner uses the impetus of cognitive studies to promote the study of all that literary and ordinary language have in common, begin- ning with the workings of the human mind on which literature builds. His insistence that in order "to understand what is poetic, we must understand what is everyday" (49). This sums up the shift of attention he advocates: a movement away from literature as a world apart, and a strong emphasis on what is common and unoriginal. According to Turner, our focus should not be on the divergent and controversial readings of literary texts offered by critics, but on their shared basis, "the common conceptual and linguis- tic apparatus readers bring to texts" (19). The cognitive approach, unlike others, "provides a ground that is common to the whole profession" (22). Turner has good reason to turn the study of literature on its head- or rather, back on its feet. Literary language is indeed embedded in nor- mal everyday language, and unconscious processes are the foundation for both.2 Johnson, Lakoff, and Turner must be credited for the insistence and the convincing reasoning with which they have traced the origins of metaphor in the realm of everyday, bodily experience. (See also Link 1978, whose contributions to the study of metaphoric systems have remained largely unacknowledged outside Europe, and Drews et al. 1985.) Turner's strength lies in showing how language and literary strategies are grounded in conceptual structure and in the body. His affirmation of the conceptual systematicity of metaphor gives a different meaning to the phrase "truth of poetry" by making us realize that poetic images, while they may be original and surprising, are not arbitrary. In fact, many of Turner's insights dove- tail with findings in literary criticism and theory that call for a dialogue with reader response theories, which addressed the construction of the text in the reader's mind long before the rise of cognitivism. Turner's emphasis on the "unoriginality" of poetic convention similarly accords with-and sheds new light on-the fact that literary styles, genres, and devices have always been highly codified and conventionalized; a large body of literary studies is devoted to analyzing these codes and conventions.3 Turner's re- 2. Turner follows the standard practice of cognitive psychologists in using unconscious in place of the psychoanalytic term preconscious. His use does not imply repression, but merely inaccessibility from the conscious mind. 3. For a recent study of conventionality in literature see Weninger 1994. Any introduction to a specific style or genre--such as realism (Forum fur Philosophie 1992), drama (Asmuth 199o), or poetry (Burdorf 1995)-cannot fail to acknowledge implicitly, even if it does not address explicitly, the conventions that define this style or genre.</page><page sequence="5">Gross * Cognitive Readings 275 placement of tropes and conceits of language with conventions of thought and body is new. He does not merely recast knowledge that has been avail- able in literary studies and analyze it in cognitive terms, but instead shows the cognitive basis that literary texts and their study presuppose. 3. The Disappearance of Literature Turner does an excellent job detailing the category structures that shape our thinking, their complexity, and the constraints that govern them. He loves establishing systematicity, analyzing rules, offering categories. De- pending on the reader's background, the point will vary at which he or she will begin to feel that the author's elaborate attempts to categorize fail to capture what poetic language is, how it works, and how it affects readers. As passionate as Turner is about the beauty and efficiency of the work- ings of the human mind, his enthusiasm for concepts does not extend to actual works of literature. Witness what he says about everyday concepts such as conversation and argument: "These concepts, unimaginably intricate in their detail yet supple when they go to work, are broadly powerful, and underlie a wide range of our everyday thought, speech, and behavior. Each is an object of wonder quite superior to any literary work with which we might care to compare it. ... Such entire works exist at their highest level as partial expressions and uses of these concepts" (241; my emphasis). For Turner, literature pales in comparison with the concepts whose praise he sings. In fact, literature comes across as an infringement. It obscures the beauty and perfection of the concept, which appears in its full splendor only when it is purified and extracted from its literary trappings. Turner seems to regard literature as a tool rather than a phenomenon that deserves to be studied in its own right, as for instance when he claims that "literary criticism touches home base, the full human world, to the extent that it sees literature as the expression of everyday capacities and helps us to understand them [not, that is, to understand literature itself]" (4; my emphasis). Situating literature in the study of language is a welcome and necessary-although hardly a new-suggestion, but Turner conflates the study of literature and of language, neglecting the scholarly knowledge about genres, styles, periods, and authors required for literary studies and the teaching of literature. To him, the form of a sonnet is irrelevant com- pared with the everyday grounding of the metaphors used in it. On pages 149-50 we find a brief passage on how to apply his findings to literature in three ways: 1. to the study of individual phrases (with which much of the book is concerned);</page><page sequence="6">276 Poetics Today 18:2 2. to the overall text (which, if we follow Turner's examples, is reduced to the question whether the "controlling conceptual connection" [149] is an analogy or a category); 3. to genre study. Here Turner proposes recasting genres in terms of underlying concepts (such as conversations, letters, or arguments), substituting "the cognitive sci- entific study of the nature of categories" for "the standard commonplace notion of a category so thoroughly discredited by cognitive studies during the last decade" (150). He offers a reductionist and simplistic "common- place notion" of genre with the intention of highlighting the desirability of cognitivism's contribution to this field. The most conspicuous aspect of Turner's approach is its fragmenta- tion of discourse and the concomitant disregard for coherence and overall structure. His primary interest is in matching individual phrases to under- lying rules and categories, an emphasis that is driven home by an appendix (249-61), which helpfully sorts hundreds of examples into categories such as "equations and similarities," "complex xyz metaphors," "weird specifi- cations," "xyz and specification," etc. Except for very few instances, Turner deals with literature in the form of isolated, decontextualized phrases; he sorts and groups them according to underlying patterns and metaphorical concepts, no matter whether the examples are taken from classical litera- ture, contemporary poetry, or colloquial language. This approach implies strongly that neither context nor stylistic differences are relevant for com- prehension or appreciation. The following four phrases, for instance, are lumped together under the heading "radical changes to a mental model" (137): - A rhombus is a square pushed over. - A leopard is a tiger with spots instead of stripes. - Ambition is but avarice on stilts and masked. - A historian is a prophet in reverse. (137) Here and throughout much of the text, Turner does not distinguish be- tween literary and nonliterary examples, and lists them indiscriminately according to the patterns they fit and exemplify.4 His use of the term meta- phor to refer to the underlying structuring pattern rather than to the indi- vidual metaphor is symptomatic of his inclination toward the general, and 4. Nor does Turner mention the difference between fictional and nonfictional texts. Fic- tionality is a crucial category for literature; but judging from the conspicuous omission or slighting of fictionality in most cognitive studies of reading (for instance, Gerrig [1993] who conflates "narrative" and "fictional"), cognitivism is not ready to cope with this complex issue and our response to it.</page><page sequence="7">Gross * Cognitive Readings 277 of his lack of interest in the specific instances used as evidence. He is inter- ested in individual instances of metaphors largely in terms of how they corroborate his overall system. While Turner occasionally acknowledges the importance of context, he does not translate this insight into practice anywhere in his own text. He makes poor use of a pedagogical principle he formulates as the "principle of meaningful wholes" (233). To him, a meaningful whole can be as short as an isolated phrase. Even when he admits what his actual procedure denies -that there are larger units to be considered -an intriguing note of doubt creeps in: "A book seems [!] to be a whole and substantial unit, not merely to consist of a string of individual small phrases" (24). Turner is more com- fortable with the isolated phrases on which his method depends. There are few forays into the analysis of global text structure, and single phrases are "most interesting not in themselves, but as windows on conceptual activity in general" (241; my emphasis). They are largely irrelevant as building blocks of an artistic composition (even though that is where he finds many of them), but count instead as illustrations of principles. His approach-that of extracting and assembling conceptual patterns- is not geared toward doing justice to the multiple traditions in which literary texts are situated. His very concession that critics might "wish to investigate overarching as- pects of literary texts" (149) casts this kind of study as optional, somewhat marginal, and certainly not one likely to be foremost in a critic's mind. Aside from this general dissectionist approach, a number of passages support the assertion that what makes literature and poetry literary or poetic to a large degree eludes Turner. To start with, he neglects one of the most essential and defining elements of what makes language poetic, namely, its verbal form, its sound patterns and repetitions. In a passage on prototypical relations, Turner explains that "we possess a construction in English for expressing these relations" and then offers the following list: "smooth as silk, warm as wool, blind as a bat, clear as crystal, busy as a bee, dry as dust, good as gold, hot as hell, hungry as a horse, sweet as sugar, and big as a barn door" (191). He then launches into a discussion of the map- ping that takes place, including its attributes and selection principles, but fails even to mention the selection principle at the level of sound, which is probably the first one to strike the reader: the fact that all his examples alliterate is apparently irrelevant to his analysis. This is a characteristic in- stance of the way Turner ignores form, shape, and sound in favor of struc- ture, systematicity, constancy, and prototypicality. His treatment of Ezra Pound's Cantos, for example, is both presumptuous and reductive. Brush- ing aside textual, stylistic, and allusive difficulties with which critics have grappled for decades, Turner boldly establishes order and coherence: "But</page><page sequence="8">278 Poetics Today 18:2 from a cognitive rhetorical perspective, the Cantos is coherent as an elabo- ration of a commonplace concept, journey, and a commonplace metaphor, LIFE IS A JOURNEY" (244). It seems that if only we were willing to stick to the conceptual level of analysis, literature would no longer pose a puzzle - or a challenge. Turner apparently measures literature against the standard of rhetoric and views language as a tool for "disclosing ... honing and developing ... our conceptual system" (191). His remark that "grasping the symmetry of a poem is understanding its structure" (9o), for instance, not only revives a distinctly classical ideal of poetry-as-symmetry, which most twentieth- century poetry has challenged, but also drastically reduces poetic struc- ture by equating it with symmetry; moreover, his treatment of symmetry fails to take into account the fact that understanding what he views as the structure of a poem is merely one step toward understanding a poem, one factor in the complex dynamics of a reader's response to a literary text. Turner effectively avoids the uncertain ground of literature by ignor- ing and suppressing its very literariness. He highlights the complexity and beauty of our everyday logic and its default assumptions, and his reason- ing (see, e.g., 61) serves to remind us of why metaphors are effective: they are elegant, economical, pithy, revealing. Occasionally, when he does not shy away from the purpose and effect of a particular use of a certain meta- phor, he offers tantalizing glimpses of what his approach could contribute to close literary analysis. His discussion of the biblical metaphor I am the way (56-57), for example, explains the effect of violations against the sys- tematicity constraint in a manner that actually accounts for the reader's reaction to the text; here the degree of violation is proportional to the strength of the effect and, consequently, to the pleasure in reading. Yet fre- quently the reader feels called upon to defend literature against Turner's approaches. He is right to remind us that comprehension, interpretation, and assignation of meaning constantly occur below our threshold of con- sciousness. But one function of art, I would argue, is precisely to lift per- ception and interpretation out of the realm of the pragmatic, automatic, and unconscious (see also Shklovsky 1969, 1972). Literary texts endure be- cause there is something unfathomable, elusive, inexhaustible about them. As pieces of art they work by means of form and shape, and the kinds of in- sight they provide are qualitatively different from those of pragmatic texts.5 Turner strips literature and poetry of much of their power by transform- ing them into a highly rational enterprise. Expanding the study of litera- 5. Laszl6 (1987) provides support for this position from a cognitive perspective. See also Jauss 1984.</page><page sequence="9">Gross * Cognitive Readings 279 ture to encompass the workings of the human mind that underlie all acts of reading is an eminently defensible enterprise, but his approach poses the danger of reducing literature to a way of studying the human mind and thereby stripping away its uniqueness. Literature does more than demon- strate human cognition. It has always-as play, as art, and as craft-pro- vided us with new insights into what it means to be human by creating new imaginary and imaginative realities, often through novel uses of language. 4. Theory and Nostalgia Literary criticism bears the brunt of Turner's polemical attack. He charts its rise to prominence within literary studies in conjunction with the de- cline of other humanistic disciplines with venerable traditions, such as lit- erary history, the history of ideas, and linguistics. He particularly deplores the dominance of theory, which he views as "criticism turning inward upon itself" (9) and to which he attributes the marginalization and tenuous posi- tion of literary criticism in today's intellectual landscape. His thesis that the humanities will regain their relevance if they are grounded in the study of human cognition, or, phrased more broadly, in what makes us human, is based less on recent developments within the humanities than on the etymological argument that the two fields belong together. Turner virtu- ally equates being human with the realm of cognition, omitting aspects of humanness such as emotions or the faculty of play from his account. Turner's position is basically nostalgic, a stance that is curiously at odds with his enthusiastic proclamation of all the new avenues and develop- ments cognitivism has to offer. He regards the history of the study of lit- erature and language and the status of the humanities since the heyday of classical rhetoric (or, alternatively, since the Renaissance) as an accumula- tion of losses, and his rhetoric of reclamation and recovery does not admit any gains (unless, that is, they are offered by cognitivism). Blind to the broadening and innovation that has occurred in the discipline of English literature, he sees it as "isolated, on a limb" (16), "left behind" (16, 17), and emphasizes the need to return from that isolation, to "regain" and "reinte- grate" (16). Unfortunately, he weakens his case against what he considers the sorry state of literary studies by overstating it. His view ignores a num- ber of factors: for example, "the fragmentation in the profession and its lack of shared discourse" (lo), which he laments, are by no means unique to the humanities but can be seen in all disciplines, including the sciences, medicine, law, and engineering. The gloomy picture he paints of a mar- ginalized, irrelevant, fragmented, and overspecialized profession omits the fact that the study of language and literature over the past decades has</page><page sequence="10">280 Poetics Today 18:2 branched out into cultural and media studies, has embraced texts and genres hitherto excluded, has exhibited a rapidly growing interest in di- versity and, in short, has come to include the study of everyday human experience in many ways.6 Turner's antitheoretical perspective on literary studies is itself extrem- ist. He not only equates what he considers elitist theoretical approaches, or, more specifically and justly, the extremes within such approaches, with the demise of literary criticism as a whole, but he indiscriminately lumps together the whole range of "contemporary critical theory"-without offering any discussion of specific theories (two examples, Deconstruction and New Historicism, are mentioned once in passing [23])-in order to brand the newly homogenized field as marginal. Even a reference to the rivalry between different approaches (9) is concerned with status rather than substance and entails no awareness of distinctions between compet- ing theories. His accusation that "if the theory vanishes, its objects van- ish," leveled against contemporary critical theory that he claims "treats objects in literature that can be seen only by means of the theory" (4), de- nies recent theoretical approaches the capacity to contribute to our store of knowledge about literary texts. It is also based on a disconcertingly naive view of theories, scientific or otherwise, as if their proper function were to reveal a preexisting and unchangeable reality. Theories always im- pose a perspective, a conceptual grid; after all, they are supposed-that is the root of the word theoria-to convey insight and, by extension, to make visible what has not been noticed or noticeable before. In particular, Turner takes issue with an overemphasis on originality. He does not value the ingenuity of "novel" readings, but considers them marginal and eccentric (19). On the other hand, he advocates a return to a tradition in which "the humanities were founded upon creation and dis- covery" (47). It seems both unfortunate and odd that for him this tradition does not include imaginative speculative readings offered in, one would suppose, a spirit of discovery and creativity. Turner points out that "read- ing" has become a rubber category for everything from basic deciphering to specific and idiosyncratic interpretations, but his critique, while justi- fied, disregards the fact that difference, diversity, and disagreement are 6. As a general example of the movement away from the elitist and isolationist positions that Turner sees as dominating the critical landscape, the study of "high and low," the dif- ferences between and convergences of elite and popular culture, comes to mind; one specific example from literary criticism would be the enduring success of Peter Brooks's Reading for the Plot, first published in 1984, which offers a psychoanalytically oriented return to the basics of narrative.</page><page sequence="11">Gross * Cognitive Readings 281 challenging and invite dialogue. It would impoverish literary studies, and slight the potential of literature, if we were to confine our study of litera- ture to aspects that met with general agreement, opinions that were shared by everyone. Literature has always celebrated subjects, individuality, and diversity, and it is interesting for a reader to see where-and why-other readers differ in their reading. There is no reason why this dialogue can- not be conducted in a democratic fashion; democratic interaction is not limited to the scientific mode, as Turner implies when he talks about data and falsifiability. Subjectivity becomes dangerous only when it is obscured or camouflaged as objectivity; in the study of literature, it does not dis- pense with the need for supporting evidence, and by no means does it amount to arbitrariness. A carefully argued and intelligent close reading of a text should open up new perspectives. It may be surprising, but it will generally stand the test of time only if it is not arbitrary, is based on evidence from the text, and can withstand questioning and close scrutiny. Perhaps predictability and verifiability are less crucial for the study of lit- erature than whether a reading is plausible, convincing, historically sound, whether it tells us something new about the inexhaustible richness of lit- erature, whether it captures the unique way in which literature is a staging of- and commentary on -the human condition. 5. The Scientific Fallacy Turner's book promises to narrow the gap between cognitive science and the study of literature, even as it simultaneously attempts to raise the latter to a scientific standard of rigor and precision. Even cognitive reading re- search, an area of cognitive psychology far more limited than Turner's approach, has shied away from literary texts in its attempts to measure and account for reading comprehension. The sheer complexity of literary texts, the deliberate and programmatic use of ambiguity, the correspond- ing complexity of readers' responses, and the difficulty of factoring in indi- vidual, affective, and subjective reactions would seem to defy adequate representation within the narrowly defined scope of objective, quantifi- able, testable data assembled by reading research so far.7 Turner boldly 7. I can offer personal testimony: as a researcher and teacher of literature, I devised and conducted an experiment that presented readers with several short poems and monitored and recorded their eye movements during reading in order to analyze their comprehension and response to one type of literary text (Gross 1997). This experiment would have been im- possible without the generous help of a colleague in cognitive psychology, who offered the use of her laboratory and equipment and helped me to set up the experiment. I was de-</page><page sequence="12">282 Poetics Today 18:2 moves to address that neglect through his style of arguing and use of ter- minology. Interestingly, his approach, which is intended to bring together humanistic and scientific inquiry, highlights some of the doubts, difficul- ties, and irreconcilabilities that mark the relationship between the two. As it applies to literature and language, a special feature of cognitive sci- ence is precisely its status as a science, which automatically lends it cachet. Turner's rhetorical gesture is in many ways that of a scientist; his ap- proach implies that literary criticism needs predictability and verifiability in order to count as a fully legitimate human endeavor. Literature itself he treats with an air of tolerance occasionally tinged with condescension; he obviously wishes to minimize the subjectivity involved in the act of reading by refusing to differentiate between literature and other texts, and between literature and language in general. He shows little regard for the ways in which literary texts are special, except ex negativo when assert- ing that without "commonplace conceptual patterns" literary texts would be reduced to "impossible questions, opaque challenges, bizarre and mute anomalies" (246). It is the task of cognitive studies to analyze these con- ceptual patterns and thus establish the meaning of literature. Seen from this perspective, the specificity of literary texts boils down to their need for rational elucidation. It is argued here that this imposition of cognitive dis- course will in fact abolish or reduce the distinguishing features of literary discourse. In other words, tailoring the object of inquiry to the mode of inquiry entails refashioning the former in ways that fail to do it justice. Literature's potential to elude or resist Turner's categorizations can be glimpsed in his very insistence that texts-literary and otherwise- be made to yield all their secrets to scientific analysis. It is as if Turner secretly distrusted literature and were willing to approach its unruliness only under scientific conditions, where he can separate, classify, and scru- tinize as if it were under a microscope. Indeed, he calls what he offers in the book "laboratory experiments" (215). He marvels at the complexity of human cognitive structure but avoids dealing with the complexity of liter- ary expression or the complexity of human responses to art and literature. His massive deployment of scientific language and logic is driven by the lighted with the "hard data" that took me considerably beyond mere speculation and the reliance on fictitious "model readers" that are the rule in reader-response theory, but my collaborator, though intrigued by what I had done, seemed vaguely uneasy. The reason, it turned out, was the scope of my experiment and the theoretical assumptions for which I was collecting evidence, which for her manifested an unacceptable degree of speculation. One day she blurted out: "You know, what you are testing is so intangible; we [i.e., cognitive psy- chologists] spend months working on a single sentence, testing and verifying a hypothesis; and here you go with a theory about how entire texts are read!"</page><page sequence="13">Gross * Cognitive Readings 283 hope that the notoriously "vague," speculative process of literary interpre- tation can finally be endowed with a sense of scientific rigor.8 The effect is impressive, but his rhetoric and reasoning warrant closer scrutiny. Much of what Turner offers is creative speculation in the guise of scien- tific terminology, rather than adherence to scientific principles of predict- ability and verifiability. To give an extreme example, he occasionally en- gages in what he calls "speculative neurophysiology," offering daring and unsupported hypotheses about a fit between conceptual structures and the neurological setup of the brain. When he addresses symmetry (95-98) or discusses the possibility that image-schematic structure constancy might correspond to the brain's neural topography (181-82), his ideas are plainly driven by the hope of anchoring his hypotheses in actual physiological evidence if indeed, according to his "guesswork hypothesis," "certain con- ceptual processes can be accounted for in terms of neural processes" (182). In other instances, it is less obvious that Turner's approach is merely quasi-scientific. The organizing principles he imposes and the wealth of categories he offers create an effect of scientific precision. In order to re- inforce the systematicity he diagnoses in human thinking, he emphasizes- and re-creates-it on the procedural level, which leads to two diamet- rically opposed weaknesses. On the one hand, he establishes too many layers and subdivisions of categories. At times, keeping in mind his dis- tinctions among, for example, "basic metaphor," "specific-level conceptual metaphor," "special-case metaphor," and "generic-level metaphor" (162, 170, and elsewhere) becomes a chore in itself. He overwhelms readers with dauntingly formulated patterns and rules whose degree of abstraction and highly specialized vocabulary appears to some extent gratuitous.9 Occa- sionally his categories, generalizations, and specifications seem somewhat arbitrary: for instance, his choice of conventionality, productivity, coher- ence, and entrenchment as the four properties that define "connections" 8. Gender bias still tends to accompany scientific orientation. Turner is notably weak on gender-neutral language; with very few exceptions, masculinity prevails and is used as the grammatical default. Perhaps not surprisingly, his first case study sets up the conflict-based concept of "argument"-rather than "exchange," "conversation," or "dance," for instance- as the key metaphoric structure for the dynamics of human interaction. 9. The following example may serve to illustrate this style, even if one makes allowances for the added difficulty of dealing with a passage out of context: "The theory of generic- level metaphors subsumes the theory of basic metaphors and gives us a more encompassing answer to the questions of how we understand metaphorically and how we make sense of metaphorical language. The theory of generic-level metaphors implies the theory of basic- level metaphors: (at least many) basic metaphors are entrenched special instantiations of conventional generic-level metaphors. Nonetheless, the theory of generic-level metaphors is a very different theory from the theory of basic metaphors as it was originally pro- posed" (169).</page><page sequence="14">284 Poetics Today 18:2 (154-56) is not adequately justified, nor are the relationships among the properties clear. After all, conventionality and coherence are requirements for all language use, and entrenchment seems to overlap with convention- ality to a large degree. Productivity-the most intriguing of the four-is merely listed without any amplification. At other times, driven by his desire to universalize, to show regulari- ties and similarities, Turner tries too hard to fit diverse elements into one generic pattern, to the extent that he ignores or obscures significant dis- tinctions. The three chapters on the "poetry of connections" have little to say about poetry, and his use of "connections" remains fuzzy, especially when he claims that "we think of all poems as somehow the same, . . . because in each case the connections between them are so entrenched as to constitute a category" (157-58). The term connections becomes virtually meaningless in its lack of differentiation among, for instance, equation, superimposition, transfer, paralleling, expressing one in terms of another, establishing identity, and drawing analogies. Turner himself, referring to the use of the copula in connections, offers a list that lumps together iden- tity, definition, assertion of class membership, inference, causal statement, and legal status (127). Here he could have taken his cue from either poetics or rhetoric -both offer a much higher degree of analytic precision. Turner's heavy use of impressive-sounding categories and terminology such as "basic metaphors," Johnson's "image-schematic structure," and Wimsatt's "generic entrenchment" should not blind us to the fact that these terms are not objective elements that exist out there in the real world, but are instead constructs, ways of imposing order on a continuum of lin- guistic and conceptual phenomena. In fact, Turner's practice of layering systematicity and regularity essentially imposes a new and different kind of description on language, albeit a highly formalized one that is based on cognitive, rather than linguistic, structures; he replaces rhetorical with cognitive terms and substitutes for phonological, metric, or semantic de- scriptions a notion of symmetry based on our "extremely powerful under- standing of right-left symmetry in our bodies" (89). The cognitive process, as Turner himself acknowledges, is open neither to introspection nor to observation. In the final analysis, therefore, the patterns and structures Turner analyzes are imaginative constructs applied to a set of data with- out an objective instance that can verify the "truth" of his claims. We are back to plausibility and persuasive reasoning, which is precisely what lit- erary criticism has to offer. Speculation, individual ingenuity, and creative reading are valid contributions so long as they don't pretend to be what they are not. Differences of opinion among critics are productive rather than destructive as long as they share common ground as well as areas</page><page sequence="15">Gross * Cognitive Readings 285 of disagreement. The same holds for the sciences. Contrary to the myth frequently embraced by a nonscientist public and occasionally perpetu- ated by scientists, conflicting interpretations abound; scientists do not have privileged access to objective reality, and creating scientific models to ex- plain that reality is a creative, imaginative trial-and-error endeavor. For the most part Turner's hypotheses fit well, but they are applied from the "outside" to mental processes that defy observation and do not represent some kind of essential truth of cognitive structure. Turner upgrades episte- mological insights to an ontological status of truth by presenting the way we process reality as if it were an ontology of mental structure. His re- peated references to the "nature" of objects points to a similar confusion, and obscures the fact that we are dealing not with universal, objective, or unchangeable knowledge but with culturally coded, selective, and highly conventional constructions. Turner's logic, while plausible, is usually post factum rather than pre- dictive and verifiable. Moreover, upon closer inspection it frequently turns out to be circular. One such example emerges in his discussion of the "in- variance hypothesis," which postulates: "In mapping the generic level of The Nature of the Source onto The Nature of the Target, we are guided by the invariance principle" (189). Turner reasons that "metaphorical map- ping does not violate the image-schematic structure of the target. .... Thus, image-schematic properties define a topology on generic-level schemas" (178). "Image-schematic structure" is defined as that which is kept and therefore remains invariant. But there is no discussion of what would qualify as invariant before the mappings; on the contrary, the data are de- rived from the actual mappings Turner analyzes. That is, Turner simply offers whatever is not violated as the "image-schematic structure." In other words, that which has not been violated is now presented as that which can- not be violated. Independent verification is not possible in this scenario. We encounter a similar procedural crux in Turner's discussion of the meta- phor "kingdoms are clay" (184). He does not explain how we come to pick the right attribute to map, the one that makes a statement meaningful. Not surprisingly, the part of "the Nature of the Source" that is mapped turns out to be "the image-schematic part": Turner defines the aspect we select as having a priori relevance based on thefact that we select it. The circularity of Turner's argument is a procedural flaw. In more gen- eral terms it presents a view of the human mental apparatus and its com- prehension processes as confined by default to whatever structures have been, in Turner's model, preselected for activation. Allowing for the pos- sibility that in other contexts, other aspects (in this case, of clay) might be picked up as relevant would defy Turner's construction of "image-</page><page sequence="16">286 Poetics Today 18:2 schematic structures." It would, on the other hand, allow for the possibility that more flexibility and ingenuity are involved in unconscious mental operations than Turner is willing to concede. His treatment of the phrase "language is fossil poetry" (209-14) invites a similar qualification and re- vision. In his explanation of the possible link between fossilization and poetry he first defines a fossil as "the result of a commonplace transfor- mation ... applying only to organisms and physical traces of organisms, such as bones, footprints, leaf imprints, and so on" (213). He initially in- sists that "the commonplace transformationfossilization does not apply to poetry. Similarly, we think of various things as the results offossilization, but language cannot be one of them" (213). He then explains how it is that fos- silization can, after all, be applied to poetry and to our understanding of the metaphor. I would argue that Turner's view of a predetermined, fixed definition of fossilization that is, as it were, taken out of mental storage and applied, is excessively narrow and mechanical. Given the cognitive re- assessment of categories as elastic and prototype-based rather than rigidly defined (see Lakoff 1987 for an overview of the relevant research), would it not make sense to assume, similarly, that definitions are not rigidly de- marcated bodies but rather clusters of elements, some more central than others? Moreover, Turner's view makes the process appear unidirectional and rules out the possibility that the use of the word in the metaphor might actually contribute to our decision regarding which elements of the defi- nition to activate. Upon closer scrutiny, such a possibility would actually amount to an upgrading of the value of metaphors for human compre- hension. The processes of creating and understanding metaphors become more fluid and less one-sided if we hypothesize that there could be mutual influence-a kind of give-and-take-between a word's "basic" definition and its use as a metaphor; for then the metaphoric use offossilization could be seen as actually adding some facet to our understanding of that con- cept, instead of merely utilizing prepackaged information. Turner's approach raises the question of whether the emulation of sci- entific respectability sets the most fortunate or productive standard for the study of literature. Should literary criticism not be creative, imaginative, and, in lucky cases, brilliant, in order to bring out new meaning in literary texts? Can these accomplishments be measured according to a "right-or- wrong" model (which in itself represents a simplistic view of the process of scientific inquiry and hypothesis formation)? In more ways than one, literary criticism at its best does exactly what Turner attributes to cogni- tivism: it exemplifies and highlights how the human mind works and en- gages texts.</page><page sequence="17">Gross * Cognitive Readings 287 6. Rhetoric For Turner, scientific rhetoric does not preclude metaphoric language. On the contrary, he utilizes a number of metaphors and visualizations in order to capture the reader's attention. The metaphor of "reading as a journey" is invoked repeatedly, as in this conclusion: "This book, which is meant as a start-up program for the reader's own activities, has now concluded its illustrative guided tours" (215). Chapter 2 offers an elaboration of a "floor plan" metaphor of the human mind and then superimposes computer and photovisual metaphors, presumably from a wish to add dynamic force to a static image and appeal to media-literate readers. Another level of meta- phor is introduced in chapter 1 (titled "User's Manual"). Here Turner offers his book as an instrument for comprehension; terms such as default concepts and start-up program suggest an analogy between the human mind and a computer. Turner keeps turning to rhetoric as a model of what literary studies can and should accomplish. His own rhetoric is not limited to metaphors, and in contrast to the objectivity one would expect in a presentation of scientific data, it is intended to sway his readers. His argument is based primarily on the repeated use of reversals: from the novel to the unorigi- nal, from the conscious to the unconscious, from the conspicuous to the unobtrusive, from the labored to the automatic. "Understanding the obvi- ous is complex and basic. Understanding the unusual is simple-a slight extension of understanding the obvious" (68)-this favorite strategy can be found throughout the book. It is employed as a rhetorical and a cog- nitive device. On either level, it seems to preclude a more complex, bal- anced, or inclusive view in favor of an "either-or"; reversal does offer a change of positions, but not a revision of how elements are situated vis- a-vis one another. Occasionally, Turner tries so hard to dislodge some of our default assumptions that he commits overkill. Arguing against the tra- ditional body/mind division in chapter two, he insists that the body exists only in and as part of the mind, even though depicting the body as a mere appendage to the mind runs counter to one of his most important tenets, namely, the grounding of language and thought in bodily experi- ence. After a major effort to establish that the body only exists in the brain, he suddenly reverses his position again and reasserts the centrality of the body by emphasizing the embodiment of the brain (38). Turner's lack of interest in syntagmatic relations is reflected in the ab- sence of a sustained argument developed in the course of the book. Con- cerned that we might lose sight of the overall picture (as indeed we some- times do), he occasionally reels off a list of important points (see, e.g., 151).</page><page sequence="18">288 Poetics Today 18:2 He writes that "nothing goes without saying-least of all what seems to us to go without saying" (67). This assertion could be a motto for Turner's book in two ways. It underscores the importance of focusing on what seems simple and obvious, but it also reflects the insistently repetitive way in which Turner spells out everything and keeps returning to the same points to drive them home. At times, repetition takes the place of reason- ing; Turner has the overall picture in mind, but when he does not fit all the pieces in the right places there are jumps, abrupt edges, and non sequi- turs. Individual chapters offer a surprising diversity of styles, as if they had originally been written for different occasions. Chapter 2 sounds like an undergraduate lecture: compared with the "Pretext" and other chapters, its language is much simpler, and its relentless repetitions and visualiza- tions clearly favor comprehension over concision. They result in a layering of concepts where a floor plan is presented on a screen for us to "zoom closer" (30) and even to "penetrate the surface" (30). The elaborate visual- ization includes animation and even volition (42 and elsewhere) -the dis- play competes with other displays (46), it keeps moving-it "flashes back and forth" (41) or "telescopes backward" (46)-and it gets personalized to the point where it "is doing some tieing-up now" (46). Two aspects of this strategy are intriguing: first, the slew of techni- cal metaphors-screen, image, display, slide show-that suggest a mixed- media presentation create the impression that Turner does not trust a mere book to hold our attention. Second, the dynamic anthropomorph- izations add an interesting twist to Turner's own role, that is, to the com- bined stance of teacher/guide and observer (see, e.g., 33) that he maintains through most of the book. On the one hand, the high degree of mediation removes what is said from his agency and control; the dynamization makes the content of the book take on a life of its own and impersonalizes it even as it attempts to make the information accessible and appealing. The book becomes animated and inserts itself between Turner and his readers, as if the author were reluctant to communicate with his readers. The book, which repeatedly "is asking us" (46) something, or "has asked us to imag- ine" (239), usurps and displaces the agency of the author and thinking subject onto the object. On the other hand, the book's animation and its endowment with subjecthood permit Turner to join forces with the reader against its possibly alienating effect. In a mixture of coyness and modesty, the book is presented as strange, harboring "odd ideas" (46), while author and reader bond together against its assertions. This strategy allows the writer to reappear as a reader of his own thoughts; with the frequent use of "us," as in "this book asks us" (47), he fades into the crowd of those whom he hopes to enlighten with his words and establishes a reassuring</page><page sequence="19">Gross * Cognitive Readings 289 solidarity based on a doubling that permits him both to be asked and to do the asking at the same time; the scientist turns out to be "one of us" after all. This solidarity is not extended to "the overworked literary critic" to whom Turner, reappearing as a subject, offers his insights: "I cannot hope to convince the critic who declines to engage this project of its indispens- ability. I hope that the critic who fully engages it [Turner's project] will convince himself" (239). The possibly recalcitrant critic, in keeping with his isolationist and elitist attitude, has to be left to his own devices. With this exception, Turner is clearly concerned about the psychological comfort of his readers, as evidenced by what one might call psychothera- peutic inserts. It is not enough for him to denounce many of our default concepts (all the while ignoring the fact that they are grounded in the body and perceptions as much as the metaphors whose complex systematicity he finds so intriguing), he also diagnoses our imputed resistance to giving them up, to the point of anticipating a possible "identity crisis" (39, 26, 28). Here the scientist turns therapist, coaxing us to reconsider long-held assumptions, soothing our discomfort, and encouraging us to approach novel ideas. 7. Cultural Literacy, or Metaphor as Work Perhaps the most problematic part of Turner's book is his attack on E. D. Hirsch's (1987, 1988) cultural literacy program in chapter lo ("Cultural Literacy and Poetic Thought"). Turner's attempt to counter Hirsch's nar- row definition of cultural literacy focuses on the use value of literature: we teach it, that is, in order to develop in students the ability "to engage in culturally literate communication" (220). Few readers would disagree with his criticism of the way Hirsch reduces "cultural literacy" to a selection of bits of knowledge assembled in lists and reduced to testable information, but in the course of engaging Hirsch in battle, Turner undermines much of his own argument in this study. The first hints of what becomes a major logical flaw in this chapter are to be found earlier, for instance when Turner states: "To recognize an analogy requires us to bring to bear our detailed knowledge of category structure" (148; my emphasis). What should be a diagnosis of what we do efficiently and automatically acquires in Turner's phrasing the flavor of a conscious effort. In spite of his basic premise that all this knowledge is used unconsciously, and that most mental processes elude our conscious- ness (chapter 1); in spite of his explanation that basic metaphors function automatically because they are based on concepts already established in the mind and therefore require no additional work of comprehension (16o,</page><page sequence="20">290 Poetics Today 18:2 170), the distinctions between different kinds of knowledge and attention - unconscious and conscious, learned and acquired, automatic and con- trolled-occasionally become blurred. No doubt Turner is aware of such distinctions, since he emphasizes them repeatedly. Yet in his keenness to explain that nothing in the mind happens "by magic" (175) and that com- plex concepts, as easy as they are to use, are difficult to understand, his emphasis on the conceptual work that takes place acquires the wrong in- flection. His assertion that "knowing a very few generic-level metaphors gives us tremendous constructive powers of mind" (170) sounds as if this were a tool that we could deliberately pick up and wield. Likewise, his re- peated question "What can we use to understand [metaphors]?" (183 and elsewhere) implies a conscious and deliberate choice of resources. Turner is caught in a specific dilemma: he sets out to praise the human mind for its extraordinary resourcefulness, which makes comprehension effortless and smooth. His main impulse is to point out the degree to which comprehension is facilitated and regulated by unconscious concepts, basic and generic metaphors, image-schematic structures, and the principles that govern them. But in order to emphasize the complexity of our mental processes and take them out of the realm of the trivial or obvious, his other impulse is to emphasize the amount of work involved in each and every act of comprehension. Here the slippages between different concepts of work and knowledge occur and unconscious activity metamorphoses into delib- erate effort. Turner tries to counter Hirsch's approach to cultural literacy (as an as- sortment of informational snippets) with an emphasis on skills and on the actual use of knowledge. He states correctly that Hirsch "equates knowl- edge with information" (224); but Turner himself, in a move that seems uncannily analogous to Hirsch's reductionism, equates identifying meta- phorical concepts with understanding and appreciating metaphors. Turner criticizes Hirsch's way of using isolated phrases, but the following argu- ment, leveled by Turner against Hirsch, is similarly applicable to his own approach: "The difference between learning through the originals and learning through the list is the difference between having had a love affair and having memorized a definition of 'sex"' (229). Indeed, Turner goes Hirsch one better by culling his own list (exemplifying THE GREAT CHAIN METAPHOR [232]) from Hirsch's list. Here, as elsewhere in the book, Turner proceeds by isolating paradigms and fails to take into account the fact that discourse is produced, perceived, and processed syntagmatically (that is, sequentially). While both act from fundamentally different assumptions and motivations, the parallel between Turner's and Hirsch's procedures is obvious.</page><page sequence="21">Gross * Cognitive Readings 291 In his discussion of Hirsch's book, Turner uses the example of acquiring a book without knowing how to read as "an analogue of what it is like to be acquainted with the information on Hirsch's list but not to have the finely textured conceptual patterns that Hirsch does not discuss" (228; my em- phasis). Here the transition occurs in the verb to have, which moves the con- ceptual patterns from unconscious availability to conscious control, just as the passage as a whole signals a confusion-or perhaps a merging--of comprehension and appreciation. Turner criticizes Hirsch for neglecting to do what he himself does, namely, to include, for every item or phrase, information on its conceptual background. But each item inevitably refers to the system that helps to constitute it, that is, it already comes with the key we need to unlock it in our minds. In fact, insofar as it "presupposes but does not mention . . . conceptual patterning" (231), Hirsch's list, while it obviously does not teach an appreciation of culture and literature, is in perfect accord with our everyday thinking and language use. Turner commits nothing less than an about-face in the course of his cri- tique. Having emphasized the major role of unconscious knowledge and its marvelous efficiency, he now disparages that powerful intuitive knowl- edge and claims that it is essential to elevate it to the level of consciousness in order to generate metaphors. This is a curious inversion: after study- ing and presenting evidence that, after all, was produced from intuitive knowledge without any kind of conscious compliance with rules, Turner now wants to persuade us that conscious awareness and formulation of the rules he deduced must precede production and comprehension. In chap- ter ten, he disregards his own evidence to the contrary and emphasizes the need to make knowledge explicit for production, as if having it available in full consciousness were a prerequisite for its use. A logical fallacy is at work here: Turner has suddenly decided to remove our cognitive abilities from the realm of () everyday experience; (2) uncon- scious knowledge and activity; and (3) the bodily grounding where he had been at pains to situate them for us. But it should be self-evident that using something is not dependent on an intellectual awareness of how it works, and understanding what is meant by a metaphor is in no way linked to being able to categorize it. Most importantly- and obviously-intellectual categorization is not required for an intuitive understanding; otherwise metaphors would not be as pervasive as they are. We do not acquire cul- tural literacy by learning lists by heart. Neither do we acquire it by reading Turner's book or being taught how to use concepts. We acquire concepts and develop cognitive capabilities in the process of using them, not by being taught a pattern. Turner's fundamental misconception here is simi- lar to a confusion between object language and metalanguage, declarative</page><page sequence="22">292 Poetics Today 18:2 and procedural knowledge. We do not need to scrutinize our mental pat- terns like a blueprint before coining a metaphor, and we know intuitively when metaphors work; we understand phrases and can judge their "right- ness," without being able to formulate, after Turner's fashion, the concep- tual reasons why they work. In fact, "wrong" metaphors are rare (except in Turner's book, where he invents numerous examples in order to prove his theories, sometimes making the reader feel as if his whole enterprise were about spotting incorrect metaphors); and Turner's pedagogical impulse here seems both misguided and ridiculous -rather like teaching grammar to an infant or a native speaker. It is not necessary to have been taught THE GREAT CHAIN METAPHOR to understand the metaphorical phrase "hand-in- hand" (236). In fact, if poets had to go about their work that way, we would probably have little literature worth reading, and Turner's suggestion that "the logician should be trained in poetry and the poet should be trained in logic" (236) should be emended to read "the student/scholar of poetry" rather than "the poet." It seems safe to say that language would boast few, if any, of Turner's examples if their originators had to be instructed first in the reasons for- and the conceptual correctness of- their utterances. Chapter o1 offers several other similarly unexpected turns. At the be- ginning of this chapter, Turner writes that cultural literacy is the ability to distinguish metaphors from literal statements (217-18). This novel claim is surprising for two reasons: first, the distinction between the literal and the metaphorical is one that Turner himself has tried to dissolve earlier in the book; and second, to the extent that we do make the distinction, he has shown that we do so constantly and unconsciously. Turner also introduces a major-and unacknowledged-shift from recognizing literary devices to writing instruction, as if good writing were a question of the conscious application of cognitive patterns. Without broaching the discussion about composition and writing, it must be said that such important skills as de- veloping an argument, paying attention to grammatical coherence, and distinguishing among statements, assertions, and hypotheses are far be- yond the scope of Turner's emphasis on concepts and patterns, which is paradigmatic rather than syntagmatic and therefore focuses on similari- ties, not on process, development, and continuity. 8. Conclusion Reading Minds is a polemic conceived to counter what Turner considers a dangerous bias toward marginality, subjectivity, and eccentricity with a movement to a diametrically opposed position. Turner's view of the re- lationship between cognitivism and literary studies is similarly one-sided,</page><page sequence="23">Gross * Cognitive Readings 293 and his own practice fails to follow his assertion that "a cognitive approach to linguistic and literary acts is not a theory of literature that precludes other theories" (22). Although Turner's challenge to redefine the humani- ties and embrace the foundations of cognitivism is offered with some per- suasive evidence, he has largely missed the opportunity to convince readers that cognitive science is relevant to the study of literature. That is unfortu- nate. After all, since cognitivism is more than a theory about literature or a methodological approach, it can indeed be hospitable to other approaches and theories and may be used in conjunction with a variety of theories that make or imply statements about what literature is or should be. Turner, however, foregrounds cognitivism to an extent that impairs our view of the subject in question. Cognitivism should be the ground, not the figure, with regard to literature. Turner's justifications, especially in the final part of his book, are as questionable as those passages in which he creates the im- pression that without the enlightenment of cognitive science, literary texts are inaccessible or irrelevant. Cognitivism speaks about the human mind in general, while a crucial feature of literature, notwithstanding its propensity to engage and portray the universal and the prototypical, has always been the individuality of authors, works, and readers. In addition to addressing general-anthro- pological-features of literary competence, literary scholarship must ac- count for this specificity. Literature is created-and re-created in the act of reading--by individual minds, and as much as these minds may have in common, subjectivity is a vital component of literary texts and the way we engage them. Turner risks reducing literature to the lowest common de- nominator, to that which everyone sees, knows, and reads in a text. When he states that "cognitive research into literary acts naturally focuses on com- mon readings" (19), the nature he postulates is that of cognitive studies, not of literature. Turner's insistence on what is common and general in litera- ture needs to be balanced by a consideration of what makes works of art specific and unique. His emphasis on quasi-scientific analysis favors what is predictable; literature is brought alive by what is baffling, provocative, unpredictable. As yet, the field of cognitive studies is insufficiently equipped to deal with the complexity of human thought processes. In particular, it excludes the dimension of what philosophy has termed "sensate cognition" (cogni- tio sensitiva) in an approximation of the Greek aisthesis, as opposed to noe- sis.L? Practitioners of cognitive science can explain neither the complexity lo. See Jauss 1984; Ritter 1971 (s.v. "Asthetik"). On the trajectory of Enlightenment epis- temology, especially with respect to the role of aesthetic perception in cognition, see Adler 1988, 1989.</page><page sequence="24">294 Poetics Today 18:2 of cognitive-aesthetic perception nor the depth and individuality. of sub- jective, affective reactions. Cognitivism has already provided intriguing insights into our rational comprehension processes, but it tends to reduce the mind to its intellectual faculties and to isolate those from the emotions, as if one could draw a clear line between cognition and affect." Neither is it particularly suited to deal with what for lack of a better term has been called the "literariness" (literaturnost' in Russian, Literarizitdt in German) of literature-that which is specific about it and makes it literature (see Gross 1992: 25-30). Turner invokes George Perec as he sets out to "ques- tion the habitual" (66). An equally suitable spokesperson would have been Viktor Shklovsky. Turner's emphasis on close scrutiny and introspection, his attempts to categorize and classify, are reminiscent of Russian Formal- ism and Prague Structuralism. His vocabulary-deautomatizing, slowing down, interfering with unconscious thought-on occasion echoes that of Shklovsky almost verbatim (25, 125). For Shklovsky and his colleagues the primary function of literature was to take us out of our habitual mode of thinking and perception, to show us the world, language, and thought in a new light (Shklovsky 1969, 1972; see also Erlich 1955; Lemon and Reis 1965). But while Shklovsky attributed this quality to literature and made it the defining feature of literaturnost', Turner restricts it to cognitive science, slighting the very feature that makes literature special. Where cognitivism can and should complement the aesthetic concerns of Formalism on the methodological level, Turner displaces the excitement of discovery from literature and reading onto cognitive studies while denying it to literature. He excels at showing us that all language is remarkable and at presenting the elegance, efficiency, and complexity of our conceptual system. Pas- sages like the following remind us that his suggestions are important: "The attempt to ground literary criticism in cognitive rhetoric is no other than the attempt to map that space in which the imagination moves so that we can understand the performance of imagination within it" (247). His insis- tence that there is a system to imagination should be useful in curbing an overemphasis on subjective creativity; but too often literature recedes into the background and is not really included in this passion for discovery- it appears marginal, incidental, and is reduced to providing illustrations. Turner turns reading metaphors into a problem-solving exercise domi- nated by abstract, rational intellectual analysis. He tries to take the guess- work out of literary studies and, by extension, out of literature. But with- 11. See Ciompi 1982 on the interplay of rational intelligence and affect.

Since everyday language and mental activity yield such fascinating insight, why even bother with literature if it does nothing but replicate those structures? Turner's question "How can we make literary criticism relevant?" is very much worth asking. To the extent that the study of literature has attempted to remove literature from the common reader and ordinary thought pro- cesses, its practitioners are in danger of isolating themselves and making themselves irrelevant by imbuing their discipline with an arcane elitism. The premise that language, literature, and the mind are separate objects of study is in need of revision, as Turner has convincingly shown. While he is right to situate literature within the larger domains of language and consciousness, he is wrong to deny it virtually any special status as a form of language art. His book does not bear out his assertion that "to ground literary criticism in cognitive rhetoric is not to make literary language homogeneous, or to reduce it to the level of everyday speech" (246). That can be remedied if we take Turner at his word rather than at his practice, that is, if we take up his challenge to resituate and invigorate the study of literature by incorporating the insights offered by cognitive studies with- out neglecting what is unique about literature.
