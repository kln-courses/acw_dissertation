Students’ Initial Reaction to 9/11 Beginning around 5:30 p.m. local time, images of the two towering infer- nos in New York City followed by the collapse of one, then the other, left people in the United Arab Emirates lost for words. All through the evening the sense of incredulity continued unabated as stunned individ- uals stayed home glued to their television sets. Shock and fear of the unknown merged in people’s reactions. Images of smashed skyscrapers and shattered humanity were carried live via CNN, BBC World, and ABC, along with some twenty-five (local and Arab) satellite networks available on my television dial. Live coverage continued uninterrupted by advertisements for several days (in some cases a week) following the tragedies. The reaction from friends and colleagues that night was unan- imous: “Let us hope it was not Arabs.”  It was in a state of shock that my students and I went to class the fol- lowing day. The lesson plan I had prepared could not be utilized in toto without causing distress. All felt a need to talk about what had happened. During the course of the previous evening, some American law enforce- </page> <page sequence="5"> SALWA GHALY  ment officials and television commentators on major US media networks had begun attributing guilt to “Muslim terrorists from a number of Arab countries.” This, I found the following morning in class, was most dis- concerting to the fifteen students enrolled in my course; they sat huddled over two Arabic-language newspapers, devouring the news. A state of dis- belief reigned, disbelief that what happened had really happened and that some fellow Muslims might have been involved. During that first post-September 11th class, my students could not fathom the events of the previous fifteen or so hours. Without any prompting from me, they began to air thoughts and impressions about what they had seen on their television screens and in the newspapers. I encouraged them to talk and was curious to hear their reactions. Their all-consuming concern was not the sheer extent of lives lost (at that early point, as many as forty-thousand were feared to have been inside the World Trade Center complex when terrorism struck). Although they did express sympathy for the American people, they appeared to me to be strangely detached and preoccupied. News that Arab terrorists might indeed have been responsible for such morally reprehensible crimes against humanity, which they committed in the name of Islam, left them distraught. Their primary concern was to chase the specter of terrorism away from Islam and to exculpate Muslims from their part of the world. They could not get themselves to believe that Arab and Muslim hands were involved in 9/11. To many of them, the American administration’s attribution of guilt to “Arab terrorists” was yet another example of the western anti-Arab sentiment they saw informing American foreign poli- cy in Palestine and elsewhere. To a few, Bin Laden was beyond reproach and could in no way be held responsible. Though I found some of their 11 This rage, many in the utterances distressing, even baffling, I tried not to berate their comments Arab world would argue, but to use Socratic midwifery to get them to discern the difference has been fueled by the general perception between raw emotional reactions on the one hand and well-reasoned among Arabs that the arguments and objective statements on the other.

I did not feel it was pedagogically useful to impose my opinions on my students and feared alienating those who had expressed radical anti-western sentiments. Instead, what I endeavored to do was nourish a comfortable environment conducive to discussion where no one risked exclusion, derision, or attack. Providing my students with questions rather than answers, I invited them to interro- gate issues related to the very origin of people’s perceptions of an “other.” As will be shown in the following pages, the means by which they were to conduct this interrogation was the literature we were to read in the course. Soon after the first few days, local networks began not only to report but also to analyze news items, offering opinions about what had happened or what they believed to have happened. This analysis had a major impact on my students, whose feelings and reactions beginning roughly around the second week reflected Arab media attempts to answer the question of why the attacks had happened. Quickly, the already powerful and omnipresent Qatari-based Al-Jazeerah network—the counterpart of CNN in the Arab world—sprang into the limelight, not just in this country and region, but also in the West. More than any other Arab network, it had the means and the media infrastructure to host around-the-clock pundits, analysts, and spe- cialists from all corners of the earth. It also hosted Muslim clerics and schol- ars whose opinions carry much weight in this part of the world. A couple of weeks after 9/11, my students began repeating what they were hearing on Al-Jazeerah, and echoing local newspapers’ reservations about what was shaping up to be a major American offensive in Afghanistan. Some saw this attack as one targeting Islam and all Muslims, and questioned America’s claim that it was solely attempting to crush a fringe fundamental- ist group with links to the events of 9/11. The fact that printed media in Arabic devoted much space to anti-Arab or anti-Muslim incidents, primari- ly in the United States, but also elsewhere in the western world, corroborat- ed their fears. My students never failed to mention those incidents as exam- ples of American “bad faith.” This deep-seated suspicion of the West went hand in hand with an inability to accept that such intelligent and tech-savvy young men (as they were being portrayed on CNN and elsewhere) could 12 The difference between turn into cold-blooded terrorists.12 They found it inconceivable that one of CNN (to take one their compatriots might have piloted a plane loaded with passengers into a example of an American network) and Al-Jazeerah tower full of thousands of workers going about the business of earning a liv- lay in how they reported ing.

Some were certain that their region was to be the next target of the American offensive taking shape on their television screens. Time proved them right.  Curricular Changes Introduced in the Course after 9/11 It became clear to me that if I was to turn this disaster into a learning oppor- tunity for my students, I had to use the literature of antiquity to establish direct and indirect connections with the events of 9/11. I was going to have to combat third millennial fears, insularity, and entrenched stereotypes with the power of Homeric myth and Attic tragedy;13 I was going to have to 13 Foremost among those confront their suspicion of the Other, wariness of globalization (against fears in Muslim cultures is fear of how globaliza- which local public discourses rail), and fear of opening themselves up to the tion (often understood as world with Aristotelian ethics, the Socratic ideal, and Platonic notions of American-ization) might adversely affect religious justice.14What I set out to do over the following weeks was to demonstrate and cultural identity.

The conclude that the demo-nization of Arabs and semester had begun only a few days before. As I had initially conceived of Muslims is as erroneous it, the first part of the course was to emphasize the shift from mythos to logos, as the Arab demoniza- tion of the West. and to investigate how the Greeks had laid, in myth and drama, the seeds of their political and philosophical thought.15 Given the preoccupations of the 15 By mythos, I mean the day, and in line with the new pedagogical agenda taking shape in my head, mythological worldview and mental tools familiar I quickly realized that a dry definitional approach to concepts might not be to us in the Homeric as effective as linking the texts assigned to discourses and issues in currency epics; logos relates to reason, law of the uni- since 9/11.

Other or the Enemy through its literature became the backbone of the course. Who is the Enemy for the Ancient Greeks? What kind of Other is he/she? Is he/she a barbarian, a monster, a savage animal, or an equal? Dividing the students into groups to promote peer learning and to enable all women to participate in class, I invited them to contemplate these ques- tions, using as frames of reference other epics familiar to them from previ- ous courses, namely, Gilgamesh and Beowulf. I had not planned to include The Iliad in the course but, in light of the change of focus, I decided to ground our exploration of the Enemy in some revelatory pages of that epic. </page> <page sequence="8">  transformations I was not looking for depth as much as for some major observations and pointers to help pave the way for a detailed analysis and perusal of The Odyssey, to which more time and attention were to be devoted during the first three weeks of October 2001. Increasingly, as the weeks went by, more women students began tak- ing an active interest in the world of antiquity and how it could help shed light on current human problems and conundrums. Every once in a while, whenever I made an oblique or direct reference to the world post- 9/11, they would hasten to point out how history repeats itself and how we can see in new sociopolitical phenomena Homeric or ancient Greek echoes. More frequently, however, it was my questions on the assigned readings that lead them to establish links between ancient literature and the world around them. For them, every new link established between past and present, fact and fiction, was a source of pleasure and pride. With little intervention on my part, they had embarked on an odyssey in which not only were they going to read entertaining tales of old, but they were also going to unravel the truths about the here-and-now. As mentioned earlier, local newspapers were full of front-page articles on “Muslim- bashing” in the United States and the West; the media were also con- sumed by questions regarding the identity of the terrorists and the rea- sons that might have driven them. The focus of our class discussions had much resonance with the students. They could see how the Greeks, in their own way, were asking the same questions about those whom they perceived as Other, albeit in a different world, time, and cultural context. All through the course, the women students kept expressing amazement at how, despite their alterity, ancient Greek writers sounded “contempo- rary and modern” in terms of the concerns that preoccupied them.  Students noted how, unlike the authors of Gilgamesh and Beowulf, the Other in Homer is not a monster or an animal but a man endowed with human characteristics, with strengths and failings. They noted that Homer portrays the inimical Trojans as equal to the Greeks in courage, heroism, and humanity, so much so that were it not for Odysseus’ supreme intelli- gence, the Trojan War might have dragged on many more years. Hector, they saw, is every bit Achilles’ equal. Homer emphasizes his humanity in the scene in which he bids his wife and baby son farewell, as he does elsewhere when he narrates the Trojan hero’s dream on the eve of the fateful encounter with Achilles, a locus classicus representing fear of death of which all humans partake. In all these instances, the students found in Homer a man with a vision that did not automatically dismiss or undercut the enemy, but saw in that enemy a fellow human being. To him, the struggle between the Greeks and Trojans is not one between Good and Evil, but between political adversaries who cherish the values of civilized living. The dichotomous mode of conceptualizing the world that represents the enemy as a monstrous creature inferior to oneself is absent in The Iliad, a fact that the students discovered with little prompting from me. The students also explored concepts of Self and Other in The Odyssey, </page> <page sequence="9"> SALWA GHALY  analyzing the construction of identity in that epic.16 There, the issues of 16 Hartog’s recently-pub- ethnocentrism and representations of the Other are primarily linked to the lished book on Odysseus, particularly the chapter notions of the voyage. How does Odysseus, the canonical and prototypical entitled “The Invention of traveler of western civilization, view other groups and nations? How does the Barbarian and an Inventory of the World” he see the boundaries between self and other? Such questions, which I echoes many of the continued to pose, colored and directed the students’ responses and helped thoughts I have long them formulate their term paper topics.

I spent considerable time dealing with students’ apprehensions and per- ceptions, not head-on but indirectly, through the analysis of key Homeric episodes, underscoring how aggression, fear, suspicion—as well as stereo- types about an Other—get formulated, buttressed, and propagated to sow discord and cause wars. We looked at Odysseus’ vision of the Laestrygonians, the Sirens, the Cicones, the Cyclopes. In the last two months of the course, we also explored Antigone as a gendered Other in the Sophoclean oeuvre. My students were equally fascinated by Euripides’ Trojan and Persian women, and how they acted as “foils” for Greek women. They were partic- ularly moved by Hecabe and Medea, the “Eastern” women who, giving free reign to their emotions, effect a critique of the value of self-restraint which, more than any other, was imposed on and governed the speech and acts of “civilized Greek ladies.” Several reported that Euripides had made them cry and that they could not put his plays down, a statement that I had heard before and since from others enrolled in the same course. We emphasized how in Euripides one character or group demonizes or tags another a “bar- barian.” We likewise discussed why Medea is marginalized, then exiled, and why Hecabe is forced to sacrifice her last living child. Both Medea and Hecabe are victims of a classical Greek civilization bent on imposing exter- nal order on the disorder within the hearts and minds of protagonists. In the name of order and “civilization,” all manifestations of disorder or unruliness have to be disciplined and, at times, crushed, as evidenced by how “mad” women are treated in Euripides’ work. When referring specifically to 9/11, I attempted to steer discussion away from guilt attribution or blame shifting, realizing that such discussions were counterproductive as they encouraged intransigence and the rejection of vantage points at odds with one’s own. I found I could not call into ques- tion my students’ blanket denials that “it was not us” without appearing to accuse them of being culprits themselves. I had to tread softly, so that the bullets of self-blame would not ricochet and affect their self-image, halting all further soul-searching. We spent time unpacking what a given action </page> <page sequence="10">  transformations revealed about the values/worldview of the doers, why x did y, our moral destiny, the difference between self-defense and aggression as an end in itself. Such questions were of obvious relevance, yet meandered around the volatile political context conjured up by the ongoing crises unleashed by the events of September 11th. Thus, without dwelling much on the events of that day, I brought into focus literary and historical examples, highlighting analogous situations in classical literature.  Although I had not initially planned on including Thucydides’ History of the Peloponnesian War, I quickly realized that the students would benefit from reading extended passages from that classic, especially in view of the resur- rection of “clash of civilizations” scenarios post 9/11. Therefore, before embarking on a reading of Aeschylus’ Oresteian Trilogy, which culminates in a eulogy of Athens and the values it stands for, we spent half a week exploring the nature of the conflict between Athens and Sparta, and the direct and indi- rect causes of that protracted and devastating war. We gave some attention to the importance of conflict resolution and to how that war (as with many others) might have been averted had channels of communication between the two camps remained open and had there been genuine good will on both sides. I also asked the students to reflect upon the issue of propaganda value in Pericles’ famous “Funeral Oration,” specifically calling upon them to analyze the Athenian leader’s political rhetoric and to compare it to speech- es made by present-day politicians, from Bush to al-Sahhaf, Saddam Hussein’s Minister of Information. The uncanny parallels between Pericles’ and today’s politicians’ rhetorical moves and maneuvers gave the students new insights into how to interpret what they hear and how to read between the lines, exercises that make them better critics of their times and render them less slavish toward authority and more immune to hegemonic thinking. Conclusion While eager and motivated, my students continue to experience serious lin- guistic impediments in English expression and comprehension, having issued from a school system in dire need of overhauling, especially in the area of English-language teaching. Once at the University of Sharjah, reme- dial language courses prepare them to function in the English-medium majors of their choice. To complicate our mission further, students seldom reach us possessing the basic thinking skills expected of a freshman. UAE students tend to be passive learners and are unused to peer learning and teaching approaches that demand class participation. One of my first tasks in all my courses is to call traditional expectations into question: my role is not to spoon-feed them information, but to facilitate generating ideas through class discussions. Their role is not to receive, then regurgitate ideas, but to interact with and build upon what they study. Some social customs also constitute obstacles to effective communication: many female and some male students are intimidated by the classroom situation, or are too embar- rassed to admit ignorance or request additional explanation.  </page> <page sequence="11"> SALWA GHALY  Despite these linguistic and cultural stumbling blocks, by the end of the semester, I felt that our concerted look at Otherness and my own desire to promote a Levinasian agenda in the classroom bore fruit.17Though teachers 17 “Levinasian agenda” is, in a nutshell, a reference to cannot always assess the full impact of a certain course or curriculum and Levinas’ other-oriented evaluate the soundness of the pedagogical tools used therein without the system in which the value of hindsight, I sensed from the class’s reactions, as well as from written encounter with theOther forms the basis of assignments I received at the end of the semester, that my students had taken ethical action and self- to heart many of the lessons about pluralism and tolerance.

Those who had taken courses with me before knew that I was committed to gender equity, social justice, and cross-cultural dialogue, that I believed in Freire’s statement, “I cannot be a teacher without exposing who I am.” In this course, as in others, the students’ positive perception of their female teacher encouraged them to interrogate their built-in defensive reac- tions and readiness to point the finger at an Other as the source of all their ills and problems, or conjure pre-packaged responses sustained by years of indoctrination in a school system that reproduces dominant ideologies. Above all, I was able to impart to my students one simple lesson: namely, we should adopt a bird’s eye view of our global village, because, necessary though it may be, the worm’s eye view, if used alone, inevitably leads to cul- tural myopia. We should expand our vision of a context or event and not see it strictly through local eyes. The invasion of Iraq began while my students were reading The Oresteia, in which the issue of justice figures prominently. The collective depression in class and beyond was brought about by a daily flood of graphic scenes of blood and gore aired by local channels.20 More impor- 20 Unlike Fox, CNN, and tant, this mood was the result of a prevailing belief in the Middle East that other American news networks, Al-Jazeerah the United States was committing an act of injustice against a defenseless and the Dubai-based Al- nation.

Was Iraq a sign of worse mutilated bodies. scenarios to be played out in the Middle East? That was the question that reverberated in classrooms and campus halls. After twelve years of devas- tating sanctions that did nothing to dislodge a dictator, the Iraqi people were on the receiving end of yet another dose of western actions that dec- imated their infrastructure and killed and maimed thousands of civilians.  In Pericles’ Oration, the students saw the hubris of an arrogant and con- descending man who received due punishment when he perished in the plague that hit Athens a year following his famous speech. From their per- spective, that man was George W. Bush. In Euripides’ Odysseus (Hecabe), they saw a stone-faced imperialist who, standing motionless and emotionless in front of Hecabe’s heartbreaking pleas for mercy and compassion, lost the moral high ground Homer had depicted him as possessing. Again, that impe- rialist was—in their eyes—George W. Bush. Everywhere they looked, the students seemed to find parallels between unjust actions or ones betraying blindness and “American hubris.” I was struck by their eagerness and need to find in the texts we read meanings that helped them contextualize, explain, and map the violence a few thousand miles to the north. With little prompt- ing from me, I felt they understood that education is, to echo Freire, libera- tion. Unfortunately, in this case, liberation was defined in oppositional terms to all things American. Liberatory discourse in class was necessarily one that pitted itself against the discourses of the Rumsfelds and the Tommy Franks of the western world. The lived experience of the learners had again imposed itself on the classroom, taking me back to those moments of profound sus- picion of the West I witnessed following 9/11.  </page> <page sequence="13"> SALWA GHALY  It was frightening for me to find myself in class situations where scathing criticism of the current United States government, though justified, nonetheless echoed fundamentalist positions in currency in certain Arab social and religious discourses propagated through the media. Indeed, it seemed as if American actions in Iraq had vindicated the fundamentalists and proved them right. Was I there to confirm the students’ worst fears? How could I promote criticism of the West that was not totalizing and homoge- nizing? How could I maintain the space in which students could “practice their freedom,” while encouraging them to recognize and shun prejudice, stereotypes, and ethnocentrism? Again, the outside world gave us food for thought in the classroom: what militated against a monolithically negative reaction to the West was the fact that massive anti-war demonstrations before and during the offensives in Iraq received a great deal of media coverage in the United Arab Emirates. The western masses had spoken in unison, and their message was one of peace. This public condemnation of war meant that the Other was not the “average Westerner,” but the warmonger, the self- interested politician who believes “might is right.” After the televised images of war and destruction, of charred babies and disemboweled bodies, had sub- sided by mid-April 2003, it was possible again to reflect upon the significance of what journalists have called “the new world superpower,” that of the con- scientious, peace-promoting individuals whose cause my students shared. The real opposition was not “us” and “them,” but the people of goodwill on both sides of the cultural and religious divide on the one hand, and those who resort to force as a means to solving political conflicts on the other. Building on this basic opposition, I picked up the pieces and proceeded to teach the course along similar lines to the ones used in the fall semester of 2001 This said, I have to add with regret that the war and its aftermath have left their mark on my students’ morale and willingness to open channels of communication with the West, especially the United States, now ensconced in the region. War, it has often been thought, is a failure of the imagination. War and literature are, thus, opposites in every way imagina- ble. However, we must not forget that, while literature can go a long way toward opening new vistas in front of blinkered eyes, in times of war and human agony, the book tragically cedes its place to pressing quotidian demands. I cannot help but think of Michael Ondatjee’s character in The English Patient, sleeping in a war-ravaged Tuscan villa where books have replaced the steps of a broken staircase. I never knew that a day would come when I would have to teach the literature of antiquity and evoke Gilgamesh while the libraries of the ancient cities of Iraq were burning and Mesopotamian treasures were being looted. Having to do so has to be the most difficult teaching experience I have ever had. And this leads me to the last thought, a plea to fellow educators: we must all guard against the book becoming redundant and expendable, which happens in times of war. That is one good reason, among many, why, dreaming along with Freire, we should resist the culture of violence in all the forms it takes, including the violence of othering cultures in the classroom and beyond. </page> <page sequence="14">  transformations 21 Quoted in the conclu- Let us be guided by Appiah’s prophetic words, “there is a work of the sion of Appiah’s chapter imagination that we need to begin.”21“Race, Culture, Identity” (105).
