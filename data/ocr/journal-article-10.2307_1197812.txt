<plain_text><page sequence="1">TWO MODES OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE WALTER FALES* G OD is experienced by man as that which upholds him and as that which limits him. Religious ex- perience, whatever its specific nature, is either of the one type or of the other. In the first case it corroborates man's inborn confidence and elucidates the meaning of his life, giving him courage, serenity, peace. In the second case it painfully grows out of his transgressions, failures, despairs, as an awareness of that which is beyond his reach. This, at least, is the thesis on which the following inquiry hinges. God is experienced by man as that which upholds him. Rodin has given artistic expression to this thought in a sculpture which shows God's hand held upward, with man nestling in the palm and awakening to the possibilities of life. Religious faith grows out of man's feel- ing of being at home in his world; it is fed by the blind confidence with which he interprets his conditions as opportunities. Indeed, confidence and faith mark the beginning as well as the end of every process in which a living being achieves satisfaction. They mark the beginning inasmuch as, from the very onset of any action, we trust that our purposes can be meaningful and practicable; they mark the end inasmuch as they are a potent factor in the final consummation of expe- *Walter Fales is professor of philosophy at Lincoln University (Pennsylvania).

But between beginning and end there is the road which must be walked. If life is a promise, we must fulfil that promise. If life is constructive, we must make it so. Often we fail and discover reasons for diffidence. We are confident when we see the world as the total of potential incentives which feed our pur- poses, and we are diffident when we see it as the total of actual events which are potential impediments to our purposes. Only he who has initiative will ever learn how stubborn facts can be in paralyzing that initiative, and for this reason there is no diffidence before there has been con- fidence. In fact, it is assumed in the fol- lowing that confidence is stronger than fear, and faith stronger than doubt. This, obviously, is a thesis which cannot be proved empirically. But I hope to show that the thesis holds within the same horizon within which our under- standing of life generally proceeds and that the horizon set by the opposite thesis lacks those ultimate guaranties which make any inquiry into the mean- ing of life possible. It will be argued that this confidence, being a fundamental quality of life, is the primary source of religious convictions which, however, are articulated, clarified, and modified in and through the experience of our limitations. Religion has two functions: it promises salvation, and it reveals the metaphysical foundations of the existing world order. There are really two types of belief in- volved in this. When admonished to con- sider seriously the possibility of our liberation from bondage and sin, we are I83</page><page sequence="2">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION advised to believe in an opportunity which is open to us individually. When admonished to have faith in the friendli- ness of a universe which is based on ra- tional principles, we are advised to be- lieve in what is presented to us as an es- tablished fact. The first type of belief is related to our private status within the world order and to our estimation of ethi- cal demands; the second type, to the ob- jective status of the world and to the results of science. Slightly simplifying the matter, we may say that the two types appeal to man the doer and to man the thinker. Now it is our confidence which causes us to do things, while our inhibi- tions and frustrations start us on our road to thought. The point I shall try to make is that the first type of belief grows out of our reliance upon a sustaining power behind the universe, the second type out of our limitations. It will follow that our belief in a sustaining power is fundamental and indestructible, whereas our speculations about the order of the world and about the nature of God are liable to error and change. How does our confidence in life, as a worth-while venture, mature in the awareness of an all-sustaining principle, and how does this awareness mature to the conviction that the all-sustaining principle deserves the name of God? My point will not be that God is a person but that we can be persons through God, and through God alone. Whether God is a person, or more or less than a person, is a question which I hardly know how to interpret, much less how to answer. My argument implies that God, as the all- sustaining principle to which our confi- dence refers, is to be thought of neither as an It nor as a Thou nor as an I; rather, we depend on him in establishing the possibility of our own I-It relations, I- Thou relations, I-I relations, i.e., of our factual experience, of the experience of our obligations to others, of the experience of our own dignity. Rather than contrib- ute any speculations about the nature of God, I hope that I can say something about our relations to God. While not responsible for our having come into being, we cannot help feeling that our very existence establishes a claim and that there is something about existence which is worth saving. Even the humble, who say that man is too weak to make good the claim, do not re- nounce it. We would not achieve any- thing if we did not believe that what we achieve may have some value which it cannot have unless we have some value. We live as if we had a guaranty in our pocket certifying our value as a person; if this is an illusion, we cannot live with- out it. If existence is a claim, there must somewhere be an account against which to make this claim. If there is anything in us which is worth saving, there must be outside us some accumulation of sav- ings. If our life, taken as a whole, has any weight, there must be scales on which to weigh it. In our claim we assert something which transcends us. This awareness makes us religious, although it does not immediately give us a religion. It opens a dimension, it makes us sus- ceptible to a call. Imagine a rope hanging down from a ceiling, limp as long as it is not used. It offers an opportunity; we may climb it and reach the ceiling. Whenever we do this, the rope straightens and provides the necessary reaction to our action. It does not pull us; we have to do all the work, and the responsibility is ours. If we never get to the ceiling, we shall have no one to blame but ourselves. Yet with- out the rope we would be helpless. It holds us in every position we reach, and i84</page><page sequence="3">TWO MODES OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE it thereby saves the effect of every effort we make. In this image God's assistance is likened to the reaction provided by the rope; man's climbing is the metaphor for all those activities which realize the meaning and value of life. The simile in- dicates that man and God pool their energies as man tries to make life a worth-while venture. Some will object that they are not determined by any transcendent factors. They will say that they do not consider their lives as mandatory and that they neither believe in salvation nor claim it. But the test is not what they think they know about themselves. The test is whether their confidence outweighs their fears. Are confidence and fear co-ordinated in mutual dependency? I rather submit that confidence provides the standard scheme against whose potentiality our actual fears are silhouetted. The relation is similar to that between truth and error. Those who consider the latter as correla- tives seem to confuse truth and trueness. Truth is guidance rather than an end, a motor rather than a result; and it should be defined so as to provide the structure within which the search for true or false statements can be carried on. Error is the possibility of violating the inner organi- zation of truth. As truth sets the horizon within which errors may occur, confi- dence sets the horizon within which fears may occur. In guarded situations, confidence is our quiet companion. It hardly makes its presence felt until dan- ger causes fear, and then we feel that we lost something which we did not know we had. In short, confidence is a poten- tiality which is never fully realized but provides a measure of our courage, com- fort, and self-control in any actual situation. Fears, by way of contrast, accentuate L our confidence-but what about our - anxieties? If we denote fears as having physical causes and anxieties as caused by metaphysical issues, must we not ad- mit that the latter do threaten our con- fidence? There are probably three major issues back of our anxieties: failure (in- cluding death), sin, and the inexplicable. However, it is not so much a particular failure, a particular sin, or a particular unexplained fact which causes anxiety; it is rather the apprehension of necessi- ties which might be implied in the struc- ture of the world and which would make failure, sin, and the inexplicable inherent and unavoidable features of life. While ready to put up with such accidental defeats as we experience every now and then, we are deeply concerned about the possibility of something's being funda- mentally wrong in the administration of world affairs, and we wonder whether, owing to a mistake in the design of the universe, values might be lost which otherwise could be realized. Anxiety, in its deepest sense, is sorrow over the fact that our personal responsibility is too feeble to deliver the world from evil and that our understanding is too human to hold the full amount of evil which there is. If there be a power which can anni- hilate, not evil, but the necessity of evil, we are afraid of not being in communica- tion with that power. However, he who suffers from those doubts has, in confessing his anxiety, already yielded as much territory as his opponent needs to jump on and to com- bat him on his own grounds. How can there be talk about a faulty design unless it makes sense to speak of design? We cannot consider a nonsensical world without implying that there can be sense. We cannot be afraid of misunderstanding the universe before we had some hope of understanding it. We cannot claim to i85</page><page sequence="4">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION be strangers in this world unless we have an idea of what it means to be at home. Our confidence does not go so far as to assure us that we are under shelter. But it assures us that it is not foolish to be active. We are on a walk; so we must have some ground under our feet. Tak- ing steps-taking them in a direction as if they were getting us somewhere-is the essence of our lives. Our anxieties are secondary, contingent, and deviations from the norm. What makes man think that he lives in a world which gives him sufficient reason to be confident? There are four possible answers. Maybe man is con- fident because experience makes him so. Or "the Yes function in man" (to use an expression of William James) may be a psychological fact, biologically important but neither influenced by, nor influenc- ing, the world of facts. Or this world may be tinged, though not essentially altered, by our optimistic, and sometimes pessi- mistic, outlook, as if we wore green or blue glasses. Finally, there may be a functional relation between our confi- dence and the world as we know it. I adopt the last answer. I believe that our confidence carries in itself certain guar- anties concerning the facts with which man is confronted. This assumption may seem to throw me into the camp of the idealists. If we create our world, as some idealists say we do, we can, per- haps, make it a trustworthy place; but if we discover it, as the realists say we do, there is no telling what it is we are going to discover. Steering my boat between the Scylla of idealism and the Charybdis of realism, I define the world as the total of all incentives which potentially, if not actually, stir our activities, and I consider confidence as the motor of our activities. All objective statements we can make about our world are answers to questions which have been raised with a certain expectancy. This expectancy, which is an expression of our confidence, is constitutive of the answer, inasmuch as it sets the horizon within which the answer is found. Expectancy has the power of a cate- gory. What types of questions can be asked concerning an object? Giving some thought to this problem, Aristotle and others after him developed the cate- gories of thinking. In addition, modern philosophers, like Nicolai Hartmann and Werkmeister, have developed a second set of categories, like harmony and in- compatibility, inner and outer, deter- mination and dependence, element and structure, which they say are the cate- gories of the external world. I would be in favor of adding a third set of cate- gories, including confidence and fear, certainty and doubt, expectancy and disappointment. You may object that these are emotive functions, possibly the categories of our wishful thinking but without existential import. I believe that our objective thinking is imbedded in them. We cast and recast the meaning we read into our external conditions un- til they provide an appropriate setting for our purposes. There is a parallelism between purpose and existence. My chief point, so far, has been that the animal faith which lives in us is not simply a contingent fact but is constitu- tive of our life. The question as to whether our confidence is empirically justified is meaningless. The world we know depends on the world in which we can be active. There cannot be activity without confidence, and there cannot be life without activity. There is something in our confidence which transcends the powers of our individual responsibilities, and this is the reason why our blind faith can be translated into the religious I86</page><page sequence="5">TWO MODES OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE belief in a power which transcends us. However, there is nothing in this kind of experience which urges us to determine the attributes of that transcending power beyond what is immediately implied in our relation to it. When primitive, it is a blind faith; when developed, a silent faith. The experience of God as that which upholds us does not invite meta- physical speculations. It lies beyond the realm of what can be either true or false, and I do not think that it has ever been challenged or can be challenged by the position of skepticism and agnosticism. Even the atheist does not deny it be- cause, apparently, he does not consider it. As long as our activity is planning, we are carried away by an optimism which has its roots in our inborn confidence. We steer with that cosmic drift which takes us along, and there is neither the time nor a reason for asking about the source of that power which summons the future, because, in our way, we are that power or part of it. We feel that we are in tune with it as we exercise the right of projecting ourselves into structured ac- tuality. But when our plans are being put in action, obstacles are met, and the negative aspects of life come to the fore, sometimes growing to gigantic propor- tions. Frustrated, we want to know how far our responsibilities go, and we ask questions about that power in the uni- verse which responds, or corresponds, to our responsibility, presumably supple- menting it. Obviously, the nature of these questions is contingent on the na- ture of the impediments that lie in our way. We inquire about what is beyond the border at the very point where we hit the border, and we are likely to de- velop an intense interest in what tran- scends our human limitations. The princi- ple which appears as immanent in our initiative and as transcendent in our anxieties let us call "God." Now let me state my main thesis more fully. God is experienced by us as that which upholds us and as that which limits us. The first experience is the basis of our religious feelings but does not in- cite us to externalize our inner certainty and to take a particular interest in theo- logical questions. On the other hand, the experience of God as that which limits us is received as a shock. It stirs us, it makes us either rebellious or meditative, and it invites speculations about the nature of God. The stronger the awareness of our limitations, the deeper the need of coun- terbalancing our weakened self-respect by our reverence for the Supreme Being. Let me sketch, in the shortest of terms, the nature of our limitations and the kind of speculations to which they give rise. i. We owe our existence to a chance event, and a chance event may extin- guish it at any time. The contingency of our existence is insulting. We witness with mortification the casual manner in which a force majeure sometimes disposes of our vital concerns as if they amounted to nothing. Our moral existence hinges upon the conception of human dignity. We can- not lightheartedly exile ourselves to an insignificant corner of the universe. How- ever critical of our performance, we boast ourselves chancellors of the uni- verse, trusted with the keys which will open the doors to the sanctuary of life. And yet, while we consider ourselves as functionaries of the highest principles by which the universe is run, freak acci- dents, every so often, remind us of the fact that we are but helpless creatures. Too often a value of high order yields to a value of low order. But if the existence of mankind is a significant experiment I87</page><page sequence="6">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION rather than a cruel joke, we presume that we must somehow be related to a realm of values in which contingencies cease to be relevant facts. Unfortunately, it can be shown that all idealistic arguments which try to establish this point are based on faith rather than on cogent deductive reason- ing and that they will carry everyone as far as his faith will carry him. The fact remains that there is more of what we can believe than of what we can prove. The main difficulty lies in bringing to- gether the eternal aspect of values which are above contingency and their realiza- tion in concrete contingent situations. What is a value in the province of eter- nity as long as it has not yet been realized under the conditions of time? What hap- pens to that value in the province of eternity when it is realized under the conditions of time? Which interest, if any, does God have in seeing values realized? Why has he created an inferior world if there has been for him a perfect world? And if eternity is a world in which nothing can happen, what can be its im- pact on a world in which things happen? I do not think that there are final answers to such questions. Take White- head. He reconciles the world of eternal objects and the world of actual events in a world of everlasting achievements in which God becomes conscious of eternal potentialities. This is a solution of great ingenuity, establishing a working rela- tion between God and the world. Each stands in mutual requirement to the other. The world needs God because he saves it, and God needs the world be- cause he attains consciousness in it. What is the weakness of this position? The emptiness of God's conceptual experience, as far as it is not yet supple- mented by physical enjoyment and is below the status of consciousness, can perhaps be explained. But it is note- worthy that God lacks a power which man has: that of imagination. White- head calls God's vision "static"; it seems to be confined to an evaluation of what has actually happened. If imagination is conscious anticipation of possible com- binations which might take place in the future, Whitehead's God does not have that faculty because, if he had it, he would not have to wait for actual occa- sions before he could be provided with the imagery of his consciousness. This deficiency may be excused by the fact that God, being himself the lure for the feelings of actual entities, is the only actual entity whose appetition or imagi- nation is not lured and, for this reason, remains static. It means, however, that God, while preserving the past, does not plan the future. Having, once and for all, established a hierarchy of values which open opportunities, he awaits the out- come for the purpose of his own comple- tion, which, incidentally, never comes to an end. How we accomplish what we accomplish and how we fail to accom- plish what we fail to accomplish are not his primary concern. He is not the blind urge of creativity but the lawfulness which conditions that creativity, and only an inert being can guarantee law- fulness. If, in this part of our argument, we are looking for a God who surpasses our contingencies, Whitehead's deity, in its derivative nature, depending on actuality, is not that God. What we can learn from Whitehead's attempt or from any similar theology is this: Speculations about the nature of God are nourished by the insight into those conditions which make us feel our imperfection. Such speculations infallibly lead to the conception of a God who, in some respect I88</page><page sequence="7">TWO MODES OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE or other, is not complete. If we want to have a concrete idea of God, we can hardly help endowing him with the ex- tremes of some of our properties or with their opposites; and if we do, we can hardly expect him to be free from those limitations which harass us. Our limita- tions are closely interwoven with positive values; and, if we pull them out, the whole fabric is reduced to shreds. The only method of ridding God of all con- tingencies is the adoption of a thorough- going determinism; but a system of this kind destroys all values and spiritual needs, and in it the idea of God may well be replaced by the idea of a mechanical, if universal, lawfulness. 2. We exist as human beings, as scions of, and heirs to, an ancestry we never chose. We are tied up with the conditions of the here and now. Heritage and en- vironment subdue us to laws which may seem to dwarf our freedom. Our outlook is human, our understand- ing anthropomorphic. If there is a paral- lelism between existence and purpose, all our knowledge reflects human needs as surely as all our values reflect human ends. The case of our truths adding up to a supreme truth of universal cogency is no better than the case of our values adding up to a supreme value of univer- sal validity. The edifice of truth is built in a style which betrays the history of the human race. This makes us uncom- fortable. There is something paradoxical about human life. When we look forward in our planning, there is novelty, freedom, adventure, promise, striving, and every- thing looks like a beginning; when we look backward, there is order, necessity, obligation, fulfilment, saturation, and everything looks like an end. We are the end and can be the beginning; we are the fulfilment and can be the promise; we are descendants and can be ancestors; we are the dust blown by the wind and can be the wind. Conditions make us want to do the things we want to do, and yet we are ready to take the responsibil- ity for our wants. Can there be a being which has no past? And if it has no past, can it have a future? Can there be a being which is order in novelty, necessity in freedom, obligation in adventure, fulfilment in promise, saturation in striving, the end in the beginning? Can there be an un- conditioned conditioner? If we define the condition of a being as the ratio between incentives and im- pediments which affect its moves, an ideal condition would presumably be one in which the impediments shrink to zero. We might, for example, say that the law of inertia holds under ideal conditions, such as are given if the observed body is unaffected by any other body. But if a body is unrelated to any other body and is all by itself, it no longer makes sense to say that it either moves or is at rest. Consequently, the law of inertia does not tell us anything about an uncondi- tioned reality but serves as a limiting concept which enables us to make veri- fiable statements about our conditioned reality. Similarly, if we work out the concept of an unconditioned conditioner as a limiting concept from which to learn something about our conditions, the method may be successful. But if we wish to think of the unconditioned con- ditioner as of a reality in its own right, how can we ever avoid the absurdities which bother us in the theology of Aristotle? As I see it, a being who is not re- strained by impediments cannot organ- ize his activities. He can neither under- I89</page><page sequence="8">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION stand himself nor find the horizon within which to evaluate his work. If knowledge is a tool by which to overcome obstacles, he is not in need of such a tool. In fact, he cannot have any knowledge, if knowl- edge is a critical evaluation of the ratio between incentives and impediments or, in other words, insight into conditions. Of course, I argue from the theory of knowledge which I adopt. But I believe that the concepts of omnipotence and omniscience are difficult, if meaningful, whatever your theory of knowledge. 3. Our days are few. We are suscep- tible to illness, subjected to suffering, threatened by disaster. The story of human afflictions is fa- miliar to all of us. There is some comfort in the solidarity of those who suffer. Un- fortunately, this solidarity develops only to the extent to which there is the oppor- tunity of mutual help. Suffering makes us selfish and lonesome. We have under- standing companions in our search for truth, but nobody fully understands the intimacy of our pains. As a good ship is divided into compartments which hold tight and, in an emergency, prevent the ship from sinking, so the realm of living beings seems to be divided into compart- ments which prevent the afflictions of one section from affecting the other sec- tions. Even the artist cannot impersonal- ize our feelings without resetting them in a new frame. When our unhappiness is greatest, we would like nothing better than slipping out of our identity and being reunited with that primordial ground from which we once sprang into individual existence. Our thoughts turn to him who makes us suffer. He visits and challenges us as he does not an animal. Are we, then, nearer to him than animals? There may be that in us which matches him and may respond to his call. Yet we know so little about the design he follows in meting out the evil. If we want to understand the drama in which we are the heroes-or maybe the puppets-we must detach ourselves from our grievances and become specta- tors. We then expect that God, in the two different modes of his existence, also as- sumes a double role, as spectator and as author of the play. We feel his presence behind the actuality of the play as well as in the lasting beauty of its impersonal- ized appearance. God the creator must be given credit for having designed a drama the depth of which will never be exhausted, and we rejoice because we have been given, however modest, a role in it. God the spectator must be given credit for consummating the enjoyment of the spectacle in a manner which can leave no blemish on the perfection of his immaculate nature, and we rejoice be- cause we are permitted a few glimpses into the aesthetic rules on which the drama is based. We are glad to be actors where God is the author, and we like to belong to an audience which he honors with his presence. Our difficulty arises when, as actors, we notice God among the audience, inac- tive, looking at our suffering in a way which leaves no trace in his soul. Again we are bewildered when, as spectators, we realize God's authorship of a play in which we are humiliated. How can God see our suffering without suffering? How can he humiliate us without being humili- ated? There is companionship between actor and author and also among mem- bers of an audience; but actors and spec- tators live in different worlds, and it is precisely this difference which makes it possible for us to detach ourselves tem- porarily from our engagements as active Igo</page><page sequence="9">TWO MODES OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE beings. When we suffer, we need a divine being who suffers with us so as to know our suffering from the inside, which can- not be told. When we contemplate, we need a divine being who contemplates with us and guarantees the meaning of that which, as seen from the outside, can be told. But the two images of God which supplement the deficiencies of our active and our contemplative natures cannot be made to cover each other. The unfortunate result of this is that God hides himself as he manifests himself and that he manifests himself as he hides himself. When, as active and suffering beings, we feel his presence, we cannot externalize our experience without de- stroying its intimacy, which is essential. When, as contemplative beings, we trust in the meaningfulness of our thinking, we experience God as a rationality which presents itself as an abstract law rather than as a creative will. 4. We are sinners, and we know that we are. In fact, our value patterns are developed through self-criticism, and we cannot know of any value patterns in the light of which we would appear beyond criticism. I presume that man is not essentially bad but overdetermined by a confusing variety of incentives, not all of which can be satisfied at a time. This overdetermination is what we call our "freedom." We must sacrifice some in- centives, and there is no table of values which will serve as a reliable guide in any type of situation. As human beings, we are highly differentiated and have be- come sensitive to many types of values. The cosmos of those values seems to explode. One way out is that of going back to simplicity. It is the way of the saint, who stills his desires, who defies the lure of diversified values, who withdraws from activities and quietly beholds the com- edy of human life from a distance. There is something unreal about this approach, which flattens and idealizes the features of the world order. As sinners, we can have personality; saints are more or less alike, for they slip into anonymity as they are admitted to the blissful sight of a cosmic drift. The alternative takes us right back into life where it is at the fullest, spar- kling with activity, pregnant with am- biguity. The master-plan of the universe, if there be any, is no longer obvious. Aberrations are fascinating experiments, possibly of permanent worth, pointing in a new direction. There are so many direc- tions-let us try this and that avenue; zigzagging may be a virtue. Rules are theory, the actual comes in exceptions. Values incompatible? Nonetheless, let us enjoy them. We admit that we are in- consistent in our preferences, paradoxical in our ways, and altogether unreliable. But we are knighted by a destiny which is intimately ours. The story written in our handwriting will not be told again. The punishment for this Promethean approach is its narrowness within the confines of personal aspirations. The sin- ner feels that he is cut off from any affilia- tions with a universal scheme and that his achievements are perishable mer- chandise. We would like to see our stand- ards sanctioned by principles which lie beyond the scope of our individual lives. We would like to be fortified by the con- tact with a metaphysical partner who guarantees the possibility of justice. But the image of this partner is blurred be- cause we no longer know how to accom- modate our highly diversified values with- in a hierarchy of pyramidal structure. Let us now draw some conclusions. The experience of God as that which I9I</page><page sequence="10">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION upholds us cannot be alien to anyone. I presume that even the so-called "athe- ist," in some subtle way, believes in an all-sustaining principle or, at least, in a principle which transcends the order of his own existence. But this belief of ours does not mature in all of us to an aware- ness of its religious significance. If and when it does, we try to form a more or less concrete idea of this all-sustaining principle. We call it "God" and want to know something about his nature. This desire is by no means mere curiosity. We need a concept of God which satisfies our religious yearnings. But we are different in that some of us cannot live without the inspiration which comes from a very concrete and elaborate idea of God, while others can very well do with a concept which includes very few, if any, specific attributes. The one extreme is a dogmatic approach, the other extreme is a mystical approach or the approach of agnosticism and of a negative theology. Most of us find our greatest religious satisfaction somewhere along the line from one ex- treme to the other. If my analysis is correct, the dogmatic approach results in difficulties and ab- surdities; and the reason for this lies in the fact that the questions to which our image of God is the answer are spon- sored by our limitations and imperfec- tions. For want of better, we use the in- adequate clues of our self-criticism in a futile effort to ground the relativity of our standards in something absolute. Our idea of God grows out of our expe- rience of God as that which limits us. If this difficulty is realized, there are, at least, four ways of meeting it. i. The absurdities are admitted but accepted because religious needs are given priority over intellectual analysis. Credo quia absurdum. 2. The image of God is touched up un- til any self-contradictory features disap- pear. The result is an idea of God as a limited being. 3. God is understood in simple terms, e.g., in terms of fatherhood and love. Further speculation is avoided. 4. All claims regarding a detached and objective knowledge of God's nature are renounced. Instead, a cultivation of the ways which lead toward him is accepted as the final aim. My own inclinations are toward the mysticism of the last approach. But I cannot accept traditional mysticism without modifications. The mystic be- lieves that men can identify themselves with God. I am no longer convinced that there is a common denominator behind you and me, behind Western and Chinese culture. The principle of identity (and the related principle of verifiability) may have to be sacrificed. It is, of course, in- dispensable in our I-It relations, but it does not dominate our I-Thou relations, much less what I call the I-I relation. In the latter the first I is the doer, the sec- ond I the critical observer, the judge-or call it "conscience." God, if experienced as that which limits us, is personified in a fictitious Thou, to whom we can address ourselves, and is objectified as a self-identical It, whose properties can be determined. The courage of maintaining this fiction has its roots in the experience of God as that which upholds us. But this latter experi- ence never directly enters into the terms either of the I-It relation or of the I- Thou relation; rather, it is understood as the basis of the I-I relation. God is not to be identified either with the first or with the second I, but, metaphorically speaking, he lives in the hyphen between the two I's. He lives in the fact that 192</page><page sequence="11">TWO MODES OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE there springs out of reality a desire to create a better reality. He causes us to see the double aspect of the present mo- ment. He invests the judge in us with authority. His presence is felt in our con- sciousness of an everlasting guaranty which warrants the significance of our responsible actions and thoughts. He is the counterweight to our weight, the necessary reaction to our actions. And he is different as we are different. If you ask him: "Who art thou?" you may expect the answer: "I am who I am not." He is that than which nothing can be less iden- tical with itself. He is not revealed, since that which has been revealed stands in its identity. He is not a fact, since that which has become a fact no longer carries invincible momentum. He is not veri- fiable, since that which is verifiable can, under changed premises, be doubted. He is ahead of all categories of thinking. Yet whatever is identical with itself and is manifested as a verifiable fact is in God and owes to him its identity and veri- fiability.
