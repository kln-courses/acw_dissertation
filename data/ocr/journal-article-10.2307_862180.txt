How and when the two halves of this sheet came to be separated no one can say, but they were stuck together with such cleverness that, although the movement of the figure was falsi- fied and unstructural, the drawing as a whole has passed unchallenged. Both half-sheets are also fragments cut down on either side. The top half of the Hercules has a piece added on the left and the lower half another piece in the lower left corner. These additions are interesting, for they show that the restorer at that time was only interested in the Hercules side, on which he has toned them to match the remainder of the sheet, leaving them white on the other side. On the right side and at the top of the upper half of the Hercules drawing are traces of gilt. It would appear from this that the drawing was once mounted, perhaps in its original form, with a gold border. H. S. EDE. A PORTRAIT OF HENRY VIII.-Mr. Clifford Smith's portrait of Henry VIII, reproduced on p. 20, represents the King as a comparatively young man. By com- parison with one of the Duke of Buccleuch's miniatures, dated 1521, when Henry was thirty years of age, it appears to be of about that date. It is probably one of the same series as some of the old portraits in Windsor Castle, formerly in Greenwich Palace. The history of the picture cannot be followed more than a few years back, when it came into the possession of a Haileybury master. It was then obscured with a thick coat- ing of filth, which has been carefully removed; by good luck little actual restoration was neces- sary. The painting is on an oak panel, 20o by 15 ins. The King wears a black cap with gold aiglets and one elaborate gold and pearl brooch or hat jewel. The hair almost entirely covers the right ear. The gown is rose-coloured, lined with brown fur and trimmed with gold on the sleeves, over a dark green doublet puffed and embroidered with gold at the wrists, trimmed at the waist with a jewelled band and slashed and frilled with cloth of gold. This is cut low at the neck, and shows a white chemisette with band embroidered with gold. Across the shoulders is REVIEWS *La Cdramique ancienne du P^rou. By R. and M. D'HAR- COURT. 48 pp. + 65 pl.

In comparing the pottery of ancient America with that of Europe, Asia and Africa, the points of similarity are found to be more remarkable than the points of difference, because, unless the archaeologists are mistaken, the potter's a sumptuous gold collar set with large oblong stones and clusters of pearls. Both hands are visible; the left (on the first and third fingers of which are rings) is in the act of withdrawing a ring from the little finger of the right hand. The background, of dull gold modelled in relief in gesso, represents Italian'silk damask of diaper pattern in floral scroll-work enclosing vases and conventional pomegranates. In the upper corners is an architectural design in gold, on which appear the Tudor Rose and Portcullis, each on a circular wreath of Renaissance design. The pendant attached to a chain round the neck is interesting as an example of the long survival of an ancient form. Brooches of this shape were relatively common among the best Merovingian jewellery of the seventh and eighth centuries. A very fine example was in the Gibson Carmichael Collection, the only difference in design being that the corners, which here are square, were there angular. Small reliquaries of this form were made in the Meuse region at the end of the twelfth and early thirteenth centuries. In them the central jewel opens to receive the relic, and the lobes were often decorated with enamel. Pos- sibly the King's pendant may be a reliquary. No other example of this type of portrait of the King is known, so far as I have been able to discover. MARTIN CONWAY. "A LOST PICTURE BY ROGIER VAN DER WEYDEN."-I should like to add one more example to the collection of copies of the lost Deposition by Rogier van der Weyden, to which M. Salomon Reinach referred in the November issue of the BURLINGTON MAGAZINE. The picture (which we reproduce on the opposite Plate) is painted on panel (84 cm. by 58 cm.), and is in a good state of preservation. It was formerly in the collection of M. Alexandre Brocard at Mos- cow, and is now at the Museum of Fine Arts in that city, where a gallery of old masters will shortly be opened. The Moscow Deposition is clearly one of the first group of panels repro- duced by M. Reinach in his article, and, it will be agreed, it is not the least important one. PAUL ETTINGER. wheel, which was the first determining factor to influence the shapes of ceramic ware in China and Egypt, as well as Greece, was unknown to the potters of ancient Mexico, Ecuador and Peru. Yet an examination of some of the decoration on the vases and bowls in the fine collection of ancient Peruvian pottery in the Ethnographical Gallery of the British Museum does seem to in- dicate that it must have been influenced by 42</page><page sequence="2">A-Decorated Vase.

Eight typical pieces of this pottery were illus- trated in a plate in connection with an article by Sir Hercules Read in THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE as long ago as April, I9IO, that being the year in which 250 of the vases found in the Chicama Valley, near Trujillo, were given by Mr. Van den Bergh to the British Museum, where there was already a very interesting col- lection, chiefly of the black ware, which had been gradually growing since 1840. Since I9I0 there have been a large number of important excavations, especially in the south- ern districts of the Peruvian coast. Previously the discovery of ancient pottery had been chiefly in the north, and in Arthur Baessler's magnificent work in four volumes, with 165 plates, compiled in I902, the 474 illustrations are of northern ware exclusively. In La Ceramique Ancienne du Perou, the authors, Monsieur R. and Madame M. d'Har- court, have arranged their work in four parts, a general introduction being followed by a description of the pottery of the South, of the Centre and of the North. The work owes much of its charm to the fact that it represents the personal impres- sion of writers who have obviously responded to the asthetic appeal of the ceramic art of this ancient race. Out of the 98 pieces illustrated, 32 are from their own collection, and several of the coloured plates are from paintings by Madame M. d'Harcourt herself, copied from specimens in the museum at Lima. There is a list of I6 " Principal works to consult," and this includes The Art of Old Peru, which was published earlier this year, by Messrs. Ernest Benn, in London, and by Messrs. Ernst Wasmuth, in Berlin, and which is in some respects in contrast with the French work. An Englishman with a knowledge of French finds La Ceramique Ancienne du Perou easier reading in the original than the work of the German doctors translated into English. This is because, while M. and Mme. d'Harcourt, as artists dealing with an archaeological subject, use simple language which is chiefly descrip- tive, The Art of Old Peru, on the other hand, deals scientifically with the subject and discusses the bearing of prehistoric American art on abstruse archaeological and ethnographical theories. However, The Art of Old Peru is an exceedingly valuable work of reference. Its list of "Recent and important publications" on Peruvian Art comprises works by 77 dif- ferent authors, and includes Arte de los Metales, by A. Barba, published in Madrid in I640. Nearly a hundred of the plates, most of which show two pieces, illustrate -pottery. Some of Dr. Walter Lehmann's theories deal scientific- ally with the development of schemes of de- coration. A particularly interesting theory is that what he calls the " plectomorphous" patterns on pottery may have originated with the pressing of the actual plaited wicker work into the clay. In the second part of The Art of Old Peru Dr. Heinrich Doering writes on "Land, People and Monuments." This is light reading compared with the first part. He draws attention to the fact that" ' Nazca ' (in the south) is poor in modelled forms and rich in strong, brilliant colours. The 'Valle de Chicama' (in the north) is rich in sculptured forms and poor in colour." These contrasting characteristics between the ware of the north and south are also emphasized by M. and Mme. d'Harcourt. If the coloured plates in both these works are faith- ful reproductions, the Nazca ware acquired by the British Museum in I912 and 1914 hardly does justice to the best colouring of southern Peruvian pottery. On the other hand the en- thusiasm both of the German and of the French authors about the lifelike portraiture in the head-vases of the north can be well understood on examining the fine Chimu specimens from the Valle de Chicama which we have in the British Museum. M. and Mme. d'Harcourt compare the work of the Chimus (or Yunkas) of the north of Peru both with the art of Archaic Greece and with European sculpture of the middle ages. "The two arts belong to each other because each is as free, as far removed from convention, as the other. Both the medieval artists and the Chimus sought to express life with sincerity and percep- tion, with humility, and in the best way they could. It is that which makes their work so per- sonal and so appealing. ... La Ceramique des Yuncas est une mine in6puisable de documents sur leur genre de vie, leur occupations, leurs mdtiers, leurs maladies, leurs croyances meme. La faune et la flore qui les entouraient sont 1l, vivantes sous nos yeux." La Ceramique Ancienne du Perou is itself a work of art, superbly printed and with a unique format, said to be in the style of Peru. L. J. s.

The relation of prints to the sphere of fine art is evidently one that varies largely in degree. In so far as they serve a purely repro- ductive purpose that is now more efficiently fulfilled by photography, their case is one that does not call for consideration. But we are faced with a different and more critical problem 47</page></plain_text>
