<plain_text><page sequence="1">SPECULATIONS ABOUT BOBWHITE QUAIL AND PAWNEE RELIGION by Patricia J. O'Brien and Diane M. Post ABSTRACT Within the C. C. Witt Smoky Hill phase earthlodge were found the remains of wings of several species of birds including four pair of northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) wings. Tliis paper examines the possible symbolic role of quail in the religious cosmology of prehistoric and early historic Pawnee, and suggests quail represented the family, parental care of children, and, perhaps, the Pawnee people them selves. Finally, as a result of this study, we suggest that archaeological data has the potential to il luminate historically obscure cosmological concepts and reconstruct aspects of a prehistoric ideology. INTRODUCTION James Deetz (1965:1), in one of the seminal studies of the new archaeology observed, "The most basic statement of archeological purpose must include a reference to the derivation of the intangible from the tangible." Implicit in such a comment is the view that the archaeological record offers us the potential to discover and reconstruct aspects of the ideology of an ancient people. In suggesting this for the Plains, we are clearly employing assumptions which are the bedrock of the Direct-Historical Approach (see Wedel 1939). That is, we are assuming that past religious behavior is reconstructable through the recovery of religious paraphernalia in archaeological associations which paral lel their historic context. Further, when an his torical people have an elaborate and sophisticated religious logic' we believe it must have a source in the past, and that it can be both projected back in time and used as a tool of in terpretation. This paper will attempt to reconstruct an aspect of ancient Pawnee religion by suggesting that four sets of northern bobwhite wings, as sociated with other faunal remains of specific noneconomically important bird species within a storage pit, were symbolically important to the Indians of the Smoky Hill phase of the Central Plains tradition ?the ancestors of the Pawnee. Thus, by its nature this paper is speculative. We do believe, however, sufficient isolated historic elements justify our construct. The historic Pawnee have a complicated ideology whose highly developed logic is dualis tic in its structure. Weltfish (1965:255) has ob served: Few ceremonical acts of the Pawnee were so obscure that they could not be understood in terms of his "logic of the universe." A rhythm of alternation of cosmic powers was a very im portant phase of that logic. The winter and the summer, the night and the day, succeeded each other in a never-ending round. The powers of the east followed those of the west. As these two rhythms were combined, the semicardinal directions ran their biennial course ? 489</page><page sequence="2">O'Brien and Post northwest, southwest, northeast, southeast ? and for each of these a sacred bundle took charge of the tribe in its turn through the alter nate seasons. In many functions of his life, in cluding the household, the Pawnee followed this alternating principle, rotation of power and responsibility in all phases of his life, par ticularly in his political life and in his appeal to the cosmos. Chamberlain (1982:97, Fig. 22) has diagrammed this dualistic ideology to show how it is related to the structural features of the earthlodge and how a lodge is a miniature of the universe ?the floor the earth, the roof the sky. Chamberlain (1982), Fletcher (1904), Murie (1981) and Weltfish (1965) record the Pawnee focus on the sky and its elements (stars, sun and moon, clouds, lightning, wind, and thunder), and the earth and its elements (people, animals, vegetation and especially Mother Corn). Birds are important components of this system because they link the sky to the earth and tie the people to the gods. The most important birds recorded in the late 19th and early 20th cen turies, particularly in the bird oriented Hako ceremony, were eagles, owls, woodpeckers, ducks and wrens (see Fletcher 1904). THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE The C. C. Witt site, an earthlodge and burial mound complex of the Smoky Hill phase of the Central Plains Tradition, was excavated near Grandview Plaza in Geary County, Kansas. The site consists of a single earthlodge (14GE600) situated on a bluffspur overlooking the juncture of the Smoky Hill, Republican and Kansas rivers. About 300 m directly south of the lodge, at the bluff apex, was a burial mound (14GE607), whose ceramics were of the same types as those within the lodge. Thus, it is believed that the site is a farmstead with an as sociated family cemetery. The lodge has a commanding view of the horizon in all directions and was aligned to the cardinal points with its entrance facing due east (O'Brien 1986:939-946). It has been dated using support post charcoal by three radiocar bon dates: UGa-824 A.D. 1250 ? 75, a post in the west wall; UGa-825 A.D. 1355 ? 60, the NW center post; and UGa-826 A.D. 1115 ? 65, the SW center post (O'Brien 1984:62), whose average is A.D. 1240 ? 66 years. Its fireplace has been dated by paleomagnetism techniques at A.D. 1325-1450 with a 2 sigma level of con fidence (Jeffrey L. Eighmy, personal com munication). Therefore, based on these two sets of dates, an average date of A.D. 1300 was proposed for the lodge and mound (O'Brien 1986:940). At A.D. 1300, the rising vernal and autumnal equinox sunlight would have shone through the entrance, crossed the fireplace and struck the altar near the west wall (O'Brien 1986:941-942). In so doing, the sunlight would have crossed over a storage pit located directly in front of the entrance. From this floated pit were recovered a variety of faunal remains (see Brown 1981) including the right wing of a red-headed woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus), the left wing of a bluejay (Cyanocitta ristata), the dis tal portion of the right wing of the rare long eared owl (Asio otus), the right and left wing of a woodpecker (Picidae), and four right and left wings of northern bobwhite (Colinus vir ginianus). Also present in that storage pit was a gar jaw (Lepisosteusplatostomus) and snapping turtle carapace (Chelydra serpentina). In another pit in the lodge were found four gar skulls (Lepisosteus sp.). On the lodge floor just north of a 4-post altar was found the right talon of a bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). No other parts of these creatures, suggesting their purely economic use, were found. The Pawnee, like other Indians of the Plains, historically used the wings of birds in ceremonies, while turtle carapaces were made into rattles. It is believed that these non economical fauna belonged to a prehistoric medicine bundle because all these elements, ex cluding the bobwhite wings, have historic paral lels in Pawnee religion. The eagle talon is an item that could have been part of a medicine bundle or some other piece of religious gear. Eagle skins, talons, feathers, claws and wings were all important ceremonial objects (Murie 490</page><page sequence="3">Bobwhite Quail and Pawnee Religion 1981:45-46,62- 63,227), and were signs of authority, representing knowledge coming from Tirawahat, his power or fire (Murie 1981:175,319). The eagle is the Chief of Day and the symbol of Morning Star, the warrior (Fletcher 1904:21-22). The owl, bluejay and woodpecker were also important. Owl feathers and skins were worn by priests and doctors. The owl is a mes senger; he teaches individuals how to worship Tirawahat (Murie 1981:227). The owl repre sents the four powers of the west that are under the control of Evening Star and do not sleep: Thunder, Lightning, Wind and Clouds. The owl is the Chief of Night and has the power to help and protect people at night (Fletcher 1904:21). The blue jay is the carrier of prayers and sacrifices to the sky; the messenger between man and Tirawahat (Murie 1981:45,63,114,227). Its skin and feathers were tied to a red pipe devoted to the sun or a black pipe devoted to the moon. Important, too, are the red-headed wood pecker (Fletcher 1904:21) and woodpeckers in general. Murie (1981:226-227) notes that the woodpecker had the special protection of Tirawahat and the Thunders because this bird cries out fearlessly during storms and builds his nest in decaying trees. The woodpecker is Chief of Trees and can protect the Pawnee from harm brought by storms and lightning. The woodpecker is the protector of the life of men (Fletcher 1904:21). Also important within Pawnee bird sym bolism are the duck and the wren, but of these no trace was found in the Witt Lodge. The duck is the Chief of Water who knows the trackless paths of the sky, water and streams of the earth. The wren is an element of humility revealing that all Pawnee, however small and insig nificant, can be cheerful and happy (Fletcher 1904:21,175,172). Additionally, though not a bird, a gar jaw is an important element in the Pawnee Four Pole Ceremony, a ritual whose function is to renew the original federation of the villages (Murie 1981:107). All these materials have been interpreted by O'Brien (1986) as the remains of a prehistoric medicine bundle, and it is believed that the lodge belonged to a prehistoric priest. Further, the similarity of religious ideas reflected in the lodge strongly points to the Smoky Hill phase of the Central Plains tradition being ancestoral Pawnee. As mentioned, recovered with the objects discussed above from the entrance pit, were the right and left wings of four bobwhite. In spite of the importance of birds as symbolic elements within Pawnee religion, however, no mention is specifically made by the previously cited authorities on Pawnee cosmology of the bobwhite. Due to the presence of four pairs of bobwhite wings in the pit with other ceremonial paraphernalia, however, it is believed that the Pawnee, at least in the prehistoric past, had some symbolic role for the bobwhite. That this role was religious is suggested, aside from their association, by the fact that there are four sets of quail wings and four is a sacred number to the Pawnee. Additionally, no other parts of these birds, suggesting their purely economic use, were found in the Witt lodge nor were any recovered in the faunal assemblages from the two addi tional lodges (14RY401 and 14P04) analyzed by Brown (1981) in her study of animal utiliza tion by Smoky Hill phase people. This is not surprising, as the birds are quite small; males and females average about 182 gm and it takes about five dressed to make a pound (Roseber ry and Klimstra 1971). Given their small size, it is not likely the the species was especially im portant economically (see Parmalee 1957, 1959, 1959a, 1960, 1960a; Smith 1975; and Kelly and Cross 1984 for documentation of this asser tation in the Missouri-Illinois area as well as Brown's [1981] detailed study for Kansas in the A.D. 1000-1500 period). Actually, documenta tion of the prehistoric utilization of birds, fish, rodents and reptiles who possess a small or deli cate bone structure is hampered by the inade quate or complete lack of reporting of their occurance in the archaeological record. This is clearly a product of the inability of ar chaeologists to recover such data before the 491</page><page sequence="4">O'Brien and Post development of flotation techniques in the late 1960's. Because the bobwhite is a ground-living bird, the presence of its wings in association with wings of ritually important sky birds raises the question, "were ground birds important at some time in the past in this cosmology?" At the turn of the 20th century, when Fletcher was collecting her data, she (1904:173) noted that the turkey was important in the past and that its feathers were used instead of those of the brown eagle to represent the female ele ment in the Hako rite; a white eagle feather represented the male element. Fletcher (1904:279) also observed a ceremonial shift from deer to bison and suggested it probably reflected movement from one environment to another on the part of the ancient Pawnee. It is historically known that the Pawnee had myths that they came from the south. It probably also reflects the rising importance of bison in the 18th and 19th centuries as horses were incor porated into their lives. Hyde (1951:39), too, reports deer were sacrificed in ancient times rather than buffalo. Fletcher (1904:173) discusses the turkey at a point in the Hako ceremony where there is a "Song of the Woodpecker and the Turkey." She notes that "in old times, long, long ago," the turkey's feathers were used where the brown eagle's feathers are presently used. The song ex plains why "the turkey and the woodpecker both desired to be the 'protectors of the children of the human race'." Since children are symbolized as eggs, the turkey argued that, be cause turkeys are more productive and lay many eggs and also have more tail feathers than any other bird, they should get the task. The woodpecker argued that, though they produced fewer eggs, the eggs were better protected since their nests were in the trees. The turkey's nest being on the ground, its eggs were subject to the predations of serpents and the hatched young were prey to foxes, wolves and weasels. Turkeys lay either 10 to 15 buff eggs (Bull and Farrand 1977: 631) or 8 to 15 (Udvardy 1977:620) while woodpeckers lay 4 or 5 (Bull and Farrand 1977:508, 646). The bobwhite lays 10 to 15 white eggs (Bull and Farrand 1977:493). For this reason the woodpecker prevailed and the turkey was deposed. Also the brown eagle was put in the turkey's place because it was not quarrelsome, was gentle and cared for its young, and because of its strength protected them better (Fletcher 1904:173). This data suggest that the Pawnee were aware of ground-living birds and at one time in the past had at least one in their cosmology. Additionally, although Fletcher does not ask why the turkey was a female element or why the change occurred. An obvious answer, given the Pawnee's logic, would be that the earth is female and the turkey is a ground-living bird. THE BOBWHITE AND PAWNEE ETHNOHISTORY There is much positive evidence for the thesis that the bobwhite was important in prehis toric Pawnee cosmology. Aspects of the be havior of bobwhite as well as archaeological, ethnographic, linguistic or pictographic data all demonstrate links between the Pawnee and the Bobwhite. The first will deal with lodge construction, the second with the annual farm ing/hunting cycle, the third with ground-living birds in the Hako ceremony, the fourth with an examination of the linguistic data linking the quail and Pawnee together, and the last with petroglyphs and pictographic symbols. We will also examine the negative evidence from Pawnee mythology. Because the bobwhite prefers open areas bordered by brushy thickets or woods, it is com monly found in the eastern part of the Plains. Being found in open, tilled fields and building nests in open grassy areas adjacent to woody cover, the bird would have been easily ob served by all farming Indians including the Pawnee. Therefore, it is perhaps not coinciden tal that there is a striking resemblance between the construction of the quail nest and the earthlodge. Rosene (1969:65-67) describes the construction of the bobwhite nest as follows: 492</page><page sequence="5">Bobwhite Quail and Pawnee Religion Male and female pick the site and build the nest together. First they form a saucer-like depression one to two and one half inches deep and four to five inches across by scratching and pecking on exposed soil. Often the depression is made near a small clump of broom sedge, wire grass, or other dead vegeta tion of like height and density, so that stems maybe used for overhead cover. The soil removed from the depression is scratched to the side and forms an elevated rim. The depres sion is filled with a few small leaves to a depth of three-quarters to one inch on which the eggs are laid nearly level with the undisturbed soil. The nest is completed after it is arched over with dead grasses, pine needles, or other stems. Wedel (1961:185-186) describes the earthlodges of the Central Plains and the Mid dle Missouri as follows: Practically without exception they include the following features: An excavated, often saucer-like area, twenty to fifty feet in diameter and varying in depth from a few inches to three feet,...a covering of poles, willows, joint grass, and finally earth or sod which left only a smoke vent at the peak of the dome shaped roof. Similarities in shape and mode of construc tion between the earthlodge and the quail nest were surely noticed by the nature oriented Pawnee. One clue that the Pawnee made analogies between lodges and nests comes from the Hako ceremony. In it the earthlodge repre sents the nest where the young are enclosed (Fletcher l^O^).1 The annual cycle and spatial distribution of quail may be pertinent as well (Rosene 1969:57 101). The cycle begins in the spring with the es tablishment of nesting territories. Once a male has established a territory, he defends it and his mate from single males. Young quail are preco cial at birth and follow their parents about the territory. Territories usually abutt each other in an area of suitable habitat. In the autumn, family units and unmated males coalesce into coveys and these coveys forage and roost together through the late fall and winter. Patterns of covey territorial defense are the same as nesting territory defense with the older male(s) defending the area. Covey areas are also spaced like nesting territories, but with a proportionally larger area being claimed. With the arrival of spring the covey breaks up into nesting pairs. Since there is strong evidence that the Central Plains tradition is related to the historic Pawnee, and probably their Arikara kinsmen, it seems reasonable to postulate that these prehistoric ancestors of these tribes followed some part of the annual hunting and farming cycle associated with those historic tribes. It is known that the prehistoric earthlodges were spatially separated into farmsteads along the rivers and streams. The presence of selected small numbers of bison bone (used for tools) suggests that Smoky Hill phase Indians hunted bison, but carried only the meat, hides, and selected bones back to their permanent homes. According to Grinnell (1961:249-254), in pre-horse times the Pawnee did not greatly depend on animal flesh, but captured birds, small mammals and a few bison. He also reports that, before the horse, the Pawnee would sur round a small bison herd on foot and, by star tling the animals, would run them back and forth until they tired and were easy prey. They hunted deer and elk the same way. If deer were more important than bison before the horse, the high ly scattered settlement system which existed be tween A.D. 1000-1500 would have been an effective way to utilize them. If such a pattern of hunting was followed prehistorically, such hunts were very likely conducted by a number of isolated farmstead households coming together. Thus, an annual alternating cycle of communal coalesence and breakup into family units would have been displayed by the Indians and the quail, pairing in the spring to farm and coalescing in the autumn to hunt. This pattern of hunting in the fall or winter is probably quite an old Caddoan trait, for the both the Caddo and the Wichita Indians had such a complementary system in the early his toric period before hunting with horses became important (see Bell, Jelks and Newcomb 1974:343; Wyckoff and Baugh 1980:252). Indeed, if the quail was one of the symbols in the prehistoric Pawnee religion, a plausible reason for its absence in their historic cosmol ogy might relate to the late prehistoric chan 493</page><page sequence="6">O'Brien and Post ges in settlement pattern, from that of individual lodges to one of large fortified villages. Raids and war with other tribes probably were as responsible for this change in the proto-his toric period as they were historically in the Middle Missouri River trench. Thus, some ele ments of the culture could have been lost or changed in the inevitable social and religious restructuring that would have accompanied such a drastic culture change. Certainly, some of the destructive impacts of tribal warfare, as well as the invasion of the Euroamericans, had an equivalent impact resulting in the loss of knowledge and population in the 19th century. Also important would have been a greater em phasis on bison with the addition of the horse in the 18th century and a greater mobility. Thus, we are suggesting that the bobwhite had an important symbolic role in prehistoric Pawnee and, by extension, Arikara life. That this suggestion is not totally groundless can be demonstrated by several pieces of historic evidence which we believed can be interpreted as dealing with quail, although they are not clearly identified as such. Fletcher (1904:161-170), in a discussion of the thirteenth ritual (occurring on the third day) of the Hako ceremony, notes that this part of the ritual invokes the female element and has four parts: the first is The Sacred Feast of Corn, the second is the Song of the Earth, the third is Songs of the Birds and the fourth is the Song of Thankfulness. The Songs of the Birds start with the egg in its nest and deal with birds that are large or small. The songs are to teach people to care for their children, even before they are born, but also teach people to be happy and thankful and to explain how birds help people (Fletcher 1904:168). The first song is "The Song of the Bird's Nest". An explanation of its meaning is quoted in full as follows: One day a man whose mind was open to the teaching of the powers wandered on the prairie. As he walked, his eyes upon the ground, he spied a bird's nest hidden in the grass, and arrested his feet just in time to prevent stepping on it. He paused to look at the little nest tuck ed away so snug and warm, and noted that it held six eggs and a peeping sound came from some of them. While he watched, one moved and soon a tiny bill pushed through the shell, uttering a shrill cry. At once the parent birds answered and he looked up to see where they were. They were not far off; they were flying about in search of food, chirping the while to each other and now and then calling to the lit tle one in the nest. The homely scene stirred the heart and the thoughts of the man as he stood there under the clear sky, glancing upward toward the old birds and then down to the helpless young in the nest at his feet. As he looked he thought of his people, who were so often careless and thoughtless of their children's needs, and his mind brooded over the matter. After many days he desired to see the nest again. So he went to the place where he had found it, and there it was as safe as when he left it. But a change had taken place. It was now full to overflowing with little birds, who were stretching their wings, balancing on their little legs and making ready to fly, while the parents with encouraging calls were coaxing the fledgings to venture forth. 'Ah!' said the man, 'if my people would only learn of the birds, and, like them, care for their young and provide for their future, homes would be full and happy, and our tribe be strong and prosperous.' When this man became a priest, he told the story of the bird's nest and sang its song; and so it has come down to us from the days of our fathers (Fletcher 1904:170). While the above could be a description of several Plains ground-living birds, the bird being described could have been the bobwhite. Unfortunately for our hypothesis, John L. Zimmerman (personal communication) pointed out that bobwhite, being precocial, leave the nest as soon as they are hatched form ing a brood with their parents. In spite of this, for it depends on how pure we wish the Pawnee to be in their descriptions of actual bird be havior, we believe, since we have bobwhite wings in a ceremonial context prehistorically and have this story in this historical ritual, where the earthlodge by the way symbolizes the nest, that it could be an example of prehis toric data helping illuminate historically obscure or unclear data. Hyde (1951:24) has pointed out that the Hako ceremony is primarily a bird ritual with birds representing the gods and the people. The purpose of the Hako ceremony is to increase the number of children in both present and future generations, i.e. the general increase of the 494</page><page sequence="7">Bobwhite Quail and Pawnee Religion Pawnee themselves. If that is the function of the ritual, then some bird must symbolize the Pawnee. Because the earthlodge is symbolical ly a nest in this ritual, it would appear logical for some bird to nest in it; we are suggesting the bobwhite quail was that bird. Clearly, this tale is an example of the moral theme that by imitating birds, especially these birds as they are examples of parental care, humans would be happy and the Pawnee, as a group, would be prosperous and strong. Thus, whether our suggestion that the birds in question are bobwhite is correct or not, the story does point out that some Plains ground-living bird was a part of the Pawnee cosmological system in the past. In fact, we have evidence for such an idea with the turkey as mentioned earlier. This is a thesis we believe is also logical, given the Pawnee concern with birds and their penchant for dualisms with alternating struc tures. The historically recorded important birds in that system all have some relationship with Tirawahat, flying high as intermediaries be tween the people and the gods. The bobwhite (as well as the turkey), as a ground-living bird, is an excellent complement to those deity oriented sky birds. Other support for our proposition is found in linguistic data. For example, the source of the word Pawnee used by many early travelers is Panis. Hyde (1951:22-23) observes that many scholars have followed Dunbar's suggestion that the word was derived from pariki, a Pawnee word meaning 'horn' and referring to the Pawnee's peculiar scalplock. Actually, accord ing to Donald J. Blakeslee (personal com munication), Dunbar was guessing at the meaning and associated it with the sign language gesture: a hooked finger on either side of the head. That gesture in fact designates the erect ears of the wolf and properly means "wolf-man" or Skidi. Mooney (1979:290-291) and Hotz (1970: n.160-161) repeat the same theory. Hotz goes further and suggests that the word came fromparisu, the Pawnee word for hunter. This is incorrect because the word is probably not Pawnee at all, but Siouan as noted by Mildred M. Wedel (1973:204). Hyde (1951:22-23) comes to a similar con clusion, for he notes that the French pani, pana, and the Spanishpanana most likely comes from the Siouxpanani. Hyde suggests it is related to the wordpanyi, which is a Siouan word stem as sociated with birds and animals that "peck or delve in the earth." He suggests it may refer to the Pawnee digging in the ground to build an earthlodge or to red feathers or a red crest. We hypothesize that it may refer to the bird that pecks in the earth to make its home and which we believe symbolized the Pawnee ?the bobwhite. Some further linguistic data comes from Champe and Fenega (1974) in an Indian Claims Commission report documenting the antiquity of the Pawnee in Kansas and Nebraska. They quote the report of Governor Miro who in 1785, said: The Cances is one hundred and eight leagues from the mouth of the Missouri, on its right bank. In high water one can ascend it to the village of the Republic (Aldea de la republica) or Panis, which the Indians call Maniguacci or the "Eyes of the Partridge" (Ojos de erdiz) (Champe and Fenega 1974:79 80). and again says: The Indians of the Panis Republic, called Paniguacey or Eyes of the Partridge (Ojos de Perdiz), live on the River Cances about a hundred and thirty leagues from its mouth, and consist of two hundred and twenty men capable of bearing arms (Champe and Fenega 1974:79-80. Donald J. Blakeslee (personal communica tion) observes that the word "ojos" can also be translated as "spring of water." Such an inter pretation would result in the village being called "the Spring of the Partridge". There are problems in resolving this issue because the Spanish "Ojos de Perdiz" is Governor Miro's translation of the Pawnee words 'Maniguacci' or Paniguacey'. Hayden (1868:404) lists ti-kits ka-wa'-ta-ku as the Pawnee word list for spring of water and, since no part of it is present in Maniguacci or Paniguacey, we assume 'eyes' not 'spring' is closer to the correct name of the 495</page><page sequence="8">O'Brien and Post village. Hayden, unfortunately, does not give the Pawnee word for eye or eyes. Further, Maniguacci clearly is a mistranscription of Paniguacey which is probab ly pani wassa or 'black pawnee* as Donald J. Blakeslee observed (personal communication), but Blakeslee reported further that Miro's mistranslation of it as meaning "Eyes of the Partridge" is additional evidence that "Eyes of the Partridge" was the name belonging to the people living in the Republican River village ? assuming 'spring' is not meant. Miro uses the European word partridge rather then quail, but we believe he means the bobwhite quail since the gray partridge (Perdix perdix) now found in latitudes north of the 45 degree line was introduced from Europe (Bull and Farrand 1977:496). That the bobwhite was being called a partridge by early Western ob servers is indicated in the James (1966:373) report of Major Stephen Long's expedition into the Plains in 1819-1820. There, in an ap pendix describing Plains fauna and listed with three types of grouse, is the entry: Virginian partridge: Tetrao (Perdix) virginianus. Today that bird is called Colinus virginianus, the Nor thern Bobwhite. Thus, the correct translation for that phrase and for those Indians would be the "Eyes of the Quail". The largest southernmost historic Pawnee village located on the Republican River is the present Pawnee Vil lage Museum site near Belleville in Republic County, Kansas. As such its occupants control led and 'watched' trading at the southern end of Pawnee territory. A further piece of linguistic data which we report, but are unable to assess fully because we are not trained linguists, deals with the possible word for quail in the Pawnee language. Hayden (1968:403) notes the Pawnee word for Partridge is at-kas; remember 19th century Western ob servers called the bobwhite a partridge. He lists no word for People or Nation, but he does list the word for Mother (p.390) as a-ti'-ra, for Father (p.390) as a-ti'-is, for Grandmother (p.391) asa-t'i-ka and Grandfather (p.391) as a tVput, and for Warrior (p.405) as a-ri-paykus. The word first associated with the Pawnee as a group was Harahey (Arahey, Arahi) when met by Coronado in 1541 (Parks and Wedel 1985:146). Other evidence suggesting quail were sym bolically important comes from similarities in the appearance of the bird and that of the Pawnee when dressed for war as well as images associated with petroglyphs and with the pic tographic symbol for the Pawnee. Bull and Farrand (1977: Fig. 257) illustrate the bird and, although its body feathers are referred to as brown, the color photograph indi cates the male has brown feathering on its back, but 'rose-colored' feathering on its un derside. Pertinent to this point, we think, is GrinnelPs data (1891) on the Pawnee Young Dog's Dance. This ritual has many similarities to the 'Sun Dance' of the Plains tribes including self-mutilation. Its purpose is to make Pawnee young men who go through it "fortunate in war". In the dance: ...the braves were all naked, and were painted red over the whole body, except that on the face, beginning on the cheeks on either side and running over the forehead, there was a band of black to represent the rainbow, and on the right shoulder blade a half moon in black, and on the pit of the stomach a black ring about four inches in diameter which repre sented themselves, ? their life. Around the joints, at the elbows, wrists, knees, and ankles, black rings were painted (Grinnell 1891:308). Why a black 'arch' would symbolize the rain bow in a war ceremony is very unclear and is question that is never discussed in Murie's (1981:255-256) examination of the Young Dog Dance. In fact, the black signs painted on the dancers are not even mentioned in his descrip tion of the dance. We can say that, with that black band and the parika scalplock, the naked red warriors would look like quail. The bobwhite have a black topknob (crest) and a black line through the eyes and across its face to the juncture of the jaw and ear. This pattern, when coupled with the ancient Pawnee practice of shaving their heads and leaving only a roach and scalplock, often greased so it would stand erect, running down the center of the skull (the pariki [Champe and Fenenga 1974:40; Grinnell 496</page><page sequence="9">Bobwhite Quail and Pawnee Religion 1961:239; Hyde 1951:22]), results in a visual image which is similar to the male bobwhite quail (see Fig. I).2 That a black or dark brown line was painted over the eyes and was part of the war paint of the Pawnee is suggested in the painting, called Segesser II, of the Villasur massacre by a force of Pawnee and Oto in 1720 (Hotz 1970:183 190). Although the black and white photographs of the painting illustrated in the text are not the best, a great number of the at tacking Indians have such facepainting and some of them even have white or a light color below the eyes like the male bobwhite. That thepariki of the Pawnee was symbolic of them as a people is reported in Mallery's (1881:472-473) study of North American In dian sign language where he says the "Right hand,..., is passed from the back part of the right side of the head, forward seven or eight inches. (Dakota I)." He also indicates "The Pani In dians are known as the Shaved-heads, i.e., leav ing only the scalp locks on the head." Mallery (1881:472-473) notes another symbol: 'wolfs ears' ? upright forefingers above the ear to im itate wolfs ears ?for the Pawnee, too. The lat ter is the sign for the Skidi Pawnee while the former is the sign for the South Bands (Donald J. Blakeslee, personal communication). In a later work dealing with American Indian pic ture-writing, Mallery (1892:386) illustrates the tribal designation of the Pawnee, especially ac cording to the Dakota winter counts, and again the pariki hair is the symbol. Mallery (1892:386) also quotes Dunbar that, "The tribal mark of the Pawnees in their pictographic or his toric painting was the scalp lock dressed to stand nearly erect or curving slightly backwards, somewhat like a horn." Thus, the meaning of pariki as either a horn or, as we would suggest, the raised crest of the fighting quail is important. Mooney (1979:290-291), as mentioned earlier, makes the same point. Finally, mention should be made of one other fascinating piece of data dealing with the Pawnee and quail. In the latter part of the 19th century James R. Mead, one of the early ex plorers, traders and settlers in Kansas made a ^^^^^^^^ ^^^1 Fig. 1.

While journey ing south along the Pawnee Trail which runs north-south through the modern Wilson to Kanopolis lakes area, he recorded a number of petroglyphs associated with the trail. One was that of a quail (see Fig. 2). We believe that this glyph was a symbol for the Pawnee people and that it was used by them as a border-boundary trail marker. The quail petroglyph was as sociated with another: "TRVDO. 1786." which Blakeslee (Blakeslee, Biasing and Garcia 1987:120-121) identifies with Jean Baptiste Trudeau who lived for three years with the Republican Pawnee. If one couples this fact with Governor Miro's identification of the southernmost Pawnee village on the Republican River as the "Eyes of the Partridge", it seems reasonable to conclude the the symbol for the South Band Pawnee was the quail. Additional petroglyphs were reported by Mallery (1892:81), who discusses and illustrates some collected by Edward Miller from outcrops on the Smoky Hill river southeast of modern Elsworth, Kansas. Mallery and Miller (1868:Pls. VI-VIII), illustrates a quail-like figure (see Fig. 3). This petroglyph, according to Miller (1868:384), is 15 miles southeast of Fort Harker. Fort Harker was situated to the southeast just outside of modern Elsworth, an area adjacent to the Pawnee Trail.3 Donald J. Blakeslee (personal communica tion), who is researching the Pawnee trail sys tem, recently sent us a xerox of Figure 4.4 entitled "Quail Hunt With Pied Piper" carved on a boulder called site 29R046, from a draft report by Winter (1985) of research on the Dry Cimarron Valley in southeastern Colorado and northeastern New Mexico. Blakeslee also in forms us that he has discovered another quail petroglyph in Colorado on a tributary of the Cimarron River along the Pawnee trail leading into the Rocky Mountains. We believe the presence of quail petroglyphs in this region is explained by Pawnee trail marking. Thus far, all the evidence we have discussed supports our position, we will now turn to data Fig. 2. A James R. Mead petroglyph from the Pawnee Trail showing a quail. It was collected in the late 19th century. 498</page><page sequence="11">Bobwhite Quail and Pawnee Religion IT ^ Fiu. 0u7. - Pawnee.

Three tribal illustrations of the Pawnee from Mallery's work on American Indian picture-writing. that do not, namely, the importance of the bird in their mythology. To that end, we tabulated the number of pages where birds were mentioned in a myth as well as the species of the bird(s) in Dorsey's (1906) 457 page study of Pawnee mythology. In this work, which describes 148 stories, the eagle or hawk was mentioned on 63 pages, the owl on 3, duck or loon on 13, geese/swan/crane on 2, crow/raven/blackbird on 30, magpie on 18, turkey/prairie chicken on 14, snowbird on 4, woodpecker on 2, 'thunderbird' on 2, swallow on 2, kingfisher on 2, and on one page each the mockingbird, snipe, lark, oriole, and quail. Within Pawnee ceremonialism, especially as described by Fletcher (1904) and Murie (1981), eagles, hawks, owls, woodpeckers, ducks, wrens, bluebirds, bluejays, crows, and even turkeys or an oriole nest are ritually impor tant to varying degrees. It is of interest to note that neither wrens, bluebirds or bluejays were mentioned in those tales. This is particularly puzzling in the case of the bluejay (bluebird) be cause it is the messenger between Tirawahat and the Pawnee people, and is important in the Hako ceremony. The significance of the absence of quail in Pawnee mythology of the late 19th cen tury discovered by this survey is difficult to as sess, as is all negative evidence. Certainly one interpretation is that the symbol system was subject to changes from the prehistoric period to the late 19th century when the bulk of the myths were recorded. Loss or changes like deer being sacrificed rather than buffalo and the turkey?eagle switch mentioned earlier, are un derstandable. SPECULATIONS ON THE SYMBOLIC MEANING OF QUAIL One question of interest which we have not addressed is, "why would the Pawnee use the quail symbolically?'' Indians are great naturalists and often tie their behavior or values to animals or birds, although these anthropomorphic projections are not unique to them or the Pawnee. As mentioned earlier, Fletcher (1904:173) noted the turkey was more important in the past and that its feathers were a female element in the Hako ceremony. We suggest the Pawnee formerly had ground birds to complement the sky birds in their cosmology. In the Central Plains some major ground birds, who spend much of their time on the ground, are the bobwhite, prairie chicken and turkey. The prairie chicken has a striking courtship pat tern in the spring and lives in undistrubed 499</page><page sequence="12">O'Brien and Post C ^^^b ^^^^^^^^ Fig. 4.

The turkey is polygamous, the male struts and gobbles to hold his harem, and the birds live in open woodlands and forests with some natural or man-made clearings. Many Indians con sidered the bird stupid and cowardly (Bull and Farrand 1977:631-632). The bobwhite, unlike other pheasant-like birds, is highly social, form ing families in the spring and covies of families in the fall (Udvardy 1977:533-534). We in fact 500</page><page sequence="13">Bobwhite Quail and Pawnee Religion suspect the bobwhite was chosen because of its "human-like" qualities. The following behavioral characteristics are common to all North American quail including the bobwhite (Leopold 1977:67-70, Stoddard 1936:15-67): the birds are highly social and gregarious, except in the nesting cycle; in the fall and winter they group into coveys and their be havior appears highly organized; in early spring their behavior changes when pairing occurs and the males become aggressive and they remain so to the end of the breeding cycle. When the young are hatched, parents and chicks form a firm social group; as summer gives way to fall, family groups form coveys. Bobwhites of either sex also have a strong tendency to adopt and rear lost or orphaned chicks or even a brood. When quail are flushed, their main concern appears to be to reestablish the group with their com panions. Quail imitate one another; for ex ample, the young are so raised that as adults, if any bird gives the warning call and 'freezes', all the other do the same, if it gives warning and 'flys away', the others will do that also. This dis ciplined behavior is learned by the very young when imitating parents. Single birds appear un easy, distracted and give out a loud assembly call; the need to reassemble at roosting time is so great it appears the birds will do so even if it is dangerous. The imitative tendency pervades life and the birds follow each other even when feeding. Leadership seems to be matter of one bird (male or female) going off and being fol lowed; if the bird is not followed, it returns to the group. The birds are cooperative in sharing a good food supply or in calling out in danger. Throughout the year, the cocks have sentry duty, but this is especially the case after pairing. He guards the hen while she is feeding, nest building, incubating the eggs and at hatching. Even after the young are developed, it is a cock who will most likely perceive danger and give warning. From the behavior of these highly social birds, and given the Pawnee habit of symboliz ing bird behavior, it would be easy for the Pawnee to isolate patterns of human social in teraction and ethics: fidelity of pairs, children imitate their parents, parents care for and protect the young, any adult in society cares for orphaned or lost children, leadership is for the good of the group, males protect females and the young, food is shared by all, and the social group is of paramount importance. These patterns could clearly be employed as symbolic models for Pawnee behavior. Also bird size does not vary between the sexes, although coloration does, and the male has a striking black mask with a white stripe above the eye and a white throat while the female is a drab varicolor brown. In the spring the male's loud whistle proclaims his possession of a nesting territory and serves to advertize for a mate. The female, on the other hand, reser ves her quiet vocalizations for leading chicks in the summer and recalling the covey in the winter. Perhaps the Pawnee drew an analogy between these loud showy males and the quiet in dustrious females, and the males and females of their own culture. If one has ever watched a covey of quail in the autumn, they clearly look like small people, busily going about their tasks and assignments. For a nature, especially bird, oriented people like the Pawnee, if they were looking for a bird to symbolize themselves, the highly social north ern bobwhite would be an obvious choice. CONCLUSIONS We believe that the four pair of northern bobwhite wings recovered from a storage pit in the lodge of a Smoky Hill phase Pawnee priest were part of the religious paraphernalia of that cleric. Just as the Eagle symbolized the warrior and Morning Star; the Owl, the mes senger from Tirawa; the Bluejay, the messenger to Tirawa; the Woodpecker, the protector of humans; the Wren, the symbol of human cheer fulness; and the Duck, knower of the unknown paths and knowledge, so we think, admittedly based on scattered 'tidbits' of historical and ar chaeological evidence, that the bobwhite quail were one of the bird elements of the ancestors of the historic Pawnee, maybe the South Bands, and that the quail were the symbol for the people 501</page><page sequence="14">O'Brien and Post themselves and particularly the symbol of parental behavior. Finally, if our argument is correct, this study demonstrates archaeologists' ability to reconstruct some intangible aspects of society. It also suggests that they have a more important role than generally assumed in documenting the ancient religious ideas and systems of non literate people, and that they have the poten tial for studying changes in religious thought and illuminating historically obscure religious concepts. NOTES * One other aspect of bobwhite behavior should be mentioned, but we do not wish to push its potential sym bolism too far. That is, when roosting, the common forma tion taken by the birds is in the form of a circle of eight with their tails toward its center and their heads facing out (Case 1973:53). The resulting head pattern is similiar to the central post pattern found in the historic Pawnee earthlodge. In assessing this question as to whether Pawnee facepainting, for war or any other purpose, might copy the facial pattern of the quail we wrote Dr. John Ewers of the Smithsonian Institution. He informed us that no study had been made of Pawnee facepainting. Therefore, our con cept at present is unexplored and speculative. He also felt there was no specific tribal mode of facepainting on the Plains. Nevertheless, it can be observed that the female bobwhite quail lacks the black and white facial markings of the male, hers are brown and buff. The resultant pattern would perfectly match the Pawnee in the Young Dog Dance. One is tempted to speculate if the matrilineal Pawnee would emulate the female bird in their symbolism. It should be noted that this petroglyph is present today at the Indian Hill site (14EW1). The site was photographed (in 1955-57) and the petroglyph in ques tion drawn, from a 35mm slide, was interpreted as a bend ing man with a phallus (Horr and Johnson (1957:Fig.lr). They do not show the 'topknot-' or 'feather-'like protrusion on the "man's head" which is illustrated by Miller (1868) and Mallery (1892) as well as by O'Neill (1981:24). Two photographs of the figure were published in O'Neill's report and they clearly show a curved line touch ing the head and extending vertically up from it and across a massive horizontal crack. It shows the phallus too, but what Horr and Johnson called a V design looks like an elon gated 'half-circle' shaped appendage which looks more like a slightly stylized wing than a human arm. We think the figure looks like a quail. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We would especially like to thank several individuals whose comments, aid and support have been important to this study. The first is Professor Donald Blakeslee of Wichita State University who read a draft of this paper and brought to our attention the existence of the Mead quail petroglyph and its importance to this study. He has also brought to our attention the quail petroglyh of Joseph Winter and the Gottfried Hotz book. Second, we would especially ike to thank Mrs. Ignace Mead Jones of Wichita, the daughter of James R. Mead, for granting us permission to use the quail petroglyph recorded in his notebooks. Third, we thank the staff of Thomas A. Witty, Jr., State Archaeologist, Kansas State Historical Society in Topeka for a recent photo of the Indian Hill site quail. Also, we thank Professor John L. Zimmerman the ornithologist of the Division of Biology at Kansas State University for his helpful comments and criticisms of this manuscript. Finally, we would like to thank the Plains Anthropologist staff: Larry Zimmerman and Patricia Peterson, and espe cially the critical anonymous reviewers who sharpened our thinking and forced us, quite justifiably, eeper into the eth nographic and historical literature.
