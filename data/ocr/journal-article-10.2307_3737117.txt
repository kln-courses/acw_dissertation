<plain_text><page sequence="1">'L'INTUIZIONE DEL FANTASTICO': ANTONIO RUBINO, FUTURIST MANQUE This article examines Antonio Rubino in the light of the Futurist movement. Rubino, better known perhaps as one of the inventors of Italian cartoon and in particular of the celebrated octosyllabic lines for the children's weekly magazine Corriere dei Piccoli, was never officially involved in the Futurist movement, nor was he ever read along these lines.' This is surprising, given his geographical and chronological contiguity with the movement, as well as his keen enthusiasm for modernity in its multiple expressions. Could a young and dynamic artist lured by the feverish cultural climate of Milan in the first decades of the century fail to come into contact, even indirectly, with the rising and loud Futurist movement? If he is indeed, as Rossana Bossaglia correctly puts it, 'personaggio-chiave nel trapasso dal Liberty al futurismo', why has Rubino's guiding principle, his intensely modern conjugation of word and image, been almost entirely overlooked.2 The question was first formulated by Rosita Del Buono Boero in the undated, short article 'Antonio Rubino, pittore e poeta fantastico', La Martinella di Milano, [I954]. This article, which may have been drafted in consultation with Rubino himself, reads: 'Egli [Rubino] fu escluso dal movimento futurista perche umorista. F. T. Marinetti, Carra, Boccioni volevano che il famoso "manifesto" fosse seriissimo, percio Rubino ne fu escluso' (p. 55). This statement, though perhaps too generic, highlights a significant aspect. While allowing for plausible contacts with Futurist circles, Boero suggests that Rubino's intense individuality and, in particular, his corrosive sense of humour, contributed to keeping him at the margins of any school or movement, including the unconventional and irreverent Futurist school. His subsequent involvement with children's literature and illustration, two artistic pursuits traditionally, if incorrectly, perceived as second rate, together with his unwillingness to take anything and anyone seriously, combined to exclude him from the ivory towers of 'arte seria'. His commitment to universal mockery and satire were incompatible with the serious, almost messianic tone pervading Futurist manifestos, not to mention the institutionalization of Futurism into 'arte di regime' which was to follow. I hope to demonstrate here, however, that 'futuristic' (one of Rubino's own favourite words), if not always properly Futurist, signs and ideals, are important elements to consider when assessing Rubino's contribution to the modernization of Italian culture between the two centuries. Without attempting to reclaim Rubino indiscriminately for Futurism, I propose to legitimize him as 'Futurist manque', or rather as a missed opportunity on the part of Italian Futurism, particularly for his indirect contribution to the developing art of cinema in Italy through his Antonietta Cutini, one of Rubino's nieces, declared in the course of an interview that she was not aware of any contacts between her uncle and the Futurists. In fact, she was convinced that Rubino intentionally kept to the margins of contemporary cultural movements and intellectual circles. Although he used to read extensively and indiscriminately, he seldom attended exhibitions and cultural events, maintaining throughout his life a zealous, desk-bound approach to his work, a habit possibly acquired during his legal training. 2 See Rossana Bossaglia, II Liberty in Italia (Milan: I1 Saggiatore, I968), p. 146.

An extremely laudatory article published in La Lettura, 4 (1905), 327-36 ('Un artista fantastico', signed by Giuseppe Bevione) granted Rubino some fame, persuading him to move to Milan, where he was initially commissioned to illustrate various musical scores (I906-09). In the same year Marinetti published his satirical tragedy Le Roi Bombance in Paris while founding, in Milan, the periodical Poesia, which was to launch Futurist poetry. Rubino remained in Milan, writing and painting, until I939. After contributing to numerous periodicals with articles and illustrations, in 1908 Rubino co-founded the best-known Italian children's periodical of all times: the Corriere dei Piccoli. In 1909, while Marinetti published his novel Mafarka lefuturiste and his first Futurist Manifesto in Le Figaro, Rubino wrote, illustrated, and published Coretta e Core, followed by a long list of similarly conceived works aimed at a wide readership of both adults and children, such as Versi e disegni (i 9 I), I balocchi di Titina (1912), Viperetta (1919), and Teatro minimo (1925). Following the example of many intellectuals of his time he fought in the First World War and co-founded La Tradotta (1918-19), a nationalist periodical to which he contributed extensively. In 1926 he took up editorship of II Balilla, a weekly magazine for 'ragazzi in camicia nera', only to be dismissed three years later on political grounds. While Marinetti's decade-long, inconstant courtship of Mussolini was to develop into a stronger bond in I929, when the founder of Futurism was awarded the title of 'Accademico d'Italia', Rubino continued to eschew active political involvement and devoted himself to publishing illustrated children's stories and poems, often in verse, such as II frottoliere (I930) and Pupi, giocattolo infelice (1938), and directed a number of children's periodicals for the publisher Mondadori (including Topolino between 1935 and 1938). During the Second World War and despite countless logistical difficulties, Rubino virtually 'invented' and developed cartoon animation in Italy, eventually producing three films: Nel paese dei ranocchi (which was awarded the first prize ex-aequo at the Venice film festival in 942), Crescendo rossiniano (i 943), and L'arco dei sette colori ( 955). After the war, back in his native Sanremo, he contributed to the satirical periodical 3 It is often lamented that Futurism, although acknowledging the potential of the young cinematographic art, failed to incorporate it into its vision of a universe reconstructed along Futurist lines. 4 These were chosen amongst eleven 'themes' singled out by a grand exhibition on Futurism held in Genoa between 17 December 1997 and 8 March i998: 'Futurismo: I Grandi Temi 1909-1944'. These were: 'metropolis', 'speed', 'simultaneity', 'the individual', 'states of mind' (or 'paroliberismo'), 'nature and cosmos', 'war', 'spirituality', 'home', 'stage', 'Futurist Liguria'. All aspects are, to a greater or smaller degree, relevant to Rubino, from his projects for interior decoration and furniture (see in particular the magnificent beds and chairs he designed and built, now held at the Wolfsonian Collection in Miami, Florida) to his posters and affiches (although his main inspiration here is art nouveau). In the words of Enrico Crispolti, home was understood as the seat of an 'intense imaginative provocation' (see 'Perche i temi del futurismo?', in Catalogo della mostra 'Futurismo': Igrandi temi Igog-I944, ed. by E. Crispolti and Franco Sborgi (Milan: Mazzotta, 1997), pp. I 1-27: 'La casa futurista e insomma il luogo di una grande provocazione immaginativa' (p. 26)). Finally, the number of eleven themes was chosen as a tribute to the founder of Futurism, who considered it to be his lucky number since it coincided with the number of letters composing his signature (F. T. Marinetti). 5 These titles are significant in view of later onomatopoeic developments. 396</page><page sequence="3">KATIA PIZZI II Gazzettone (I 949-5 ) with vitriolic articles and illustrations, and had a role of some importance in local politics, founding an independent party, which he called 'Sanremo fiorita', in 195 I. He continued pursuing his interests in writing, illustrating, publishing, and editing until he died in 1964 at Bajardo, aged eighty- four. If Rubino's biography appears to run curiously parallel to that of Marinetti without ever colliding with it, his bibliography definitely includes items of Futurist interest. The foreword to his unpublished Le cronache delfuturo reads: 'I racconti contenuti in queste cronache [.. .] non si occupano piu di ci6 che fu, ma di cio che sara: contengono l'esposizione precisa e documenta di FATTI VERI che accadranno nel tempo futuro, tra l'anno di grazia I999 e il 4032.'6 This is an incomplete, at times incoherent, manuscript, made up of stories of science fiction interspersed with onomatopoeic verses, multicoloured stains, rockets, planets, spaceships, and all the paraphernalia of 'quel misterioso FUTURO verso cui tendono tutti gli sforzi e le speranze umane'. In these impassioned pages Rubino echoes one of his own, self- illustrated, early poems, entitled 'Museo' (I900?; see Figure i), which rejects, in Futurist fashion, the sterile cult of a mummified past. Despite the generality of the terms employed here, Rubino continued to be disturbed by this 'futuro' throughout his life: for decades he was busy polishing and looking for a publisher for his Cronache (to no avail), rearranging chapter names, numbers, and dates at least a dozen times right up to the day he died, redrafting them carefully and equally frequently.7 It is ironic, but perhaps not uncommon, that the volume that troubled his author to this extent should be the only one to this date unfinished, unpublished, and remaining virtually unknown. The future as conceived by Rubino failed to materialize, but, most important, the exquisitely modern terms in which he posed the question are worth examining in some detail. Take, for instance, the theme of 'the individual', the Futurists' ambition to establish new relationships between the individual and the environment, exploring the psychic and dynamic consequences of these relationships. Rubino firmly upheld this principle, combining it, in Futurist manner, with dynamism. In frequent instances, this persuaded him to deconstruct the human figure in near-Cubist fashion. Volumes and shapes in Rubino are also usually borrowed from Cubism: cylinders, cubes, and spheres abound in his illustrations and human figures are occasionally deconstructed and rearranged according to principles of solid geo- metry. Even though his original attachment to art nouveau prevents him from radicalizing his art in Cubist directions, many of Rubino's characters do not merely retain geometrical qualities but, more specifically, become constitutionally geomet- rical, moving in the same direction as some of his contemporary Futurist artists (see Figure 2). Essentially, Rubino's universe has much in common with the colourful, mechanical, geometric apparatus invented by Fortunato Depero (I 892- 960) in his 6 The date of composition of Le cronache is unknown. Antonietta Cutini believes he probably started composing them around 191 and, as it transpires from his memoirs, continued elaborating them throughout his life. The status of the volume is also uncertain: was this to become a novel, a collection of stories, a pastiche of poetry, music and prose, or something else? 7 This emerges often in correspondence with the publisher Enrico Bemporad (see unpublished private correspondence, Carpetta A.

Futurist Manque operatic project 'I Balli Plastici' (I918).8 Tins, boxes, tubes, cables, cylinders, and coloured wheels are an integral part of the figural and ontological spaces staged by both artists, who are similarly inspired by the picturesque rather than the properly pictorial. In particular, Rubino and Depero share a fascination for the possibilities offered by toys and puppets, and, specifically, mechanical puppets. Puppets, which by virtue of their sheer mechanical nature are tinged with existential anguish, have moved a long way away from the ancestor of all modern puppets: Carlo Collodi's Pinocchio. Rubino's characters are conceived ontologically and existentially as puppets, functioning, as such, as metaphors of the human condition within modernity, an idea shared by much modern theatre from Luigi Pirandello to Tadeusz Kantor.9 Pupi, 'giocattolo infelice' (see Figure 3) is one such character: another is the disturbing 'Pierino il Burattino', possibly the most psychoanalytic puppet in the whole history of children's literature. Pierino's unfailing ability to 'return' to haunt his increasingly frustrated and neurotic owner, makes ofPierino a chilling personification of bad conscience conceived in exquisitely modern if not positively Kafkaesque terms.'? In the words of E. Severini, what one finds in 'Pierino' is 'une relation plus qu'etroite entre le cote physique et le cote psychique de l'individu, [.. .] entre l'organisme et ce qu'on appelle l'ame'.1l These disturbing analogies also affect the relation between the individual and the environment, which the Futurists sought to renegotiate in a number of ways. In Futurist fashion, Rubino often anthropomorphizes urban spaces, treated as continuations, appendices of the human figure, or creates short-circuits between the two (Figure 4).12 If Futurist landscapes become loud, festive, and colourful, Rubino's palette equally welcomes Futurist colours.'3 The idyllic nineteenth-century land- scape is replaced by a colourful explosion and juxtaposition of cubes, spheres, and intersecting rays of light. Rubino is intrigued by the possibility of rendering nature simultaneously anthropomorphic and mechanical. If he eschews the radical urban credo of the Futurists in favour of a representation that is to some extent nostalgic, his representation of nature is still truly revolutionized in directions indicated by the Futurists. His moving landscape is no longer merely 'natural' but welcomes artificial elements within it. The environment becomes, to use a favourite word, 'simul- taneous' and is characterized, in the words of Futurist painters, by a 'dislocazione e 8 These were five performances, or rather 'azioni mimico-musicali', first staged at Teatro dei Piccoli in Rome on 14 April 1918. Invented by Depero in collaboration with the Swiss poet Gilbert Clavel, the 'Balli Plastici' aimed at creating a new theatrical style, based on geometrical and visionary elements, and accompanied by original music composed especially by Francesco Malipiero and Bela Bartok, amongst others. The last of these 'Balli', Ombre, which relies heavily on Depero's earlier play Colori (1916), is an entirely abstract performance composed of the juxtaposition of coloured lights. As I shall show below, this play may be related to Rubino's own film L'arco dei sette colori. 9 See, for instance, Rino Albertarelli: 'I suoi [di Rubino] personaggi [sono] concepiti e non solo disegnati come fantocci' ('Storia dei fumetti: Antonio Rubino', Linus, I (1965), 55-60 (p. 60)). 10 'Pupi giocattolo infelice' was originally in A. Rubino, I balocchi di Titina: La storia di un balocco infelice (Ostiglia: La Scolastica, I912), then in Pupi, giocattolo infelice e altre poesie (Milan: Saita, 1938).

Rubino's abstract figurations ('superstizione', 'rimpianto', 'noia', 'i cinque sensi'), for instance, range from stiff and immobile figures, as if carved in stone, to those writhing in agony, almost under the effect of an inner fire (see Figure 5).15 Rubino's referent is still Cubism, but he both complements and tempers it by originally and systematically incorporating principles of symmetry and specularity into his aesthetics.16 If the Futurists set out to reconstruct the universe radically, according to new principles, Rubino was mainly guided by an exasperated search for symmetry. Uncompromisingly logical and symmetrical, his worlds tolerate hardly any element of chaos: see the long list of characters of his invention who are conceived as eternally incarcerated within the high walls of symmetry: Tic and Tac, Coretta and Core, Cloe and Cleo, Lillo and Lalla, and many others. Tic and Tac exemplify to a high degree the nature and scope of Rubino's game of symmetries. These are the protagonists of Rubino's novel Tic e Tac ovverossia l'orologio di Pampalona (1922), and quite literally they are designed to function as the two mechanical hearts of Pampalona's monstrous wunder-kammer clockwork (see Figure 2). 7 Ruled by its own principles, Pampalona's clock is a universe of its own ('un orologio simile non e piu un orologio: e un mondo' (p. I4)). Set in motion by sinister and disturbing creakings and buzzings reminiscent of Futurist 'rumorismi', a cacophony of tin, wood, springs, and tender scaly bodies, this elephantine clock is 14 Umberto Boccioni and others, 'Catalogue of the exhibition of Futurist Painting', Paris, Galerie Bernheim- Jeune, February 1912, cited in Catalogo della mostra Futurismo, p. 18. 15 See also Leo Lecci, 'Antonio Rubino pittore di ideogrammi', La Riviera Ligure, 19-20 (1996), 23-29 (p. 23). 16 This aspect may derive from the influence of art nouveau, but it is also significant that Rubino was completely ambidextrous. 17 The novel was first published by Vitagliano in Milan in 1922 and reprinted by Ofiria in Florence in 1948.

Tic and Tac ape the simultaneity and bi-dimensionality of this hyper-rational universe dominated by a veritable obsession with the regimentation of time and characterized by intentionally obvious symmetries between the right and the left side of the page. As in Depero's works, spontaneity and naturalness are banned from a world where the stiff and the mechanical rule and where humans and puppets, flesh and blood and papier- mache, are made to play ring-a-ring-a-roses together.18 A result of the symmetrical game that binds them together, the perpetual motion Tic and Tac unknowingly generate, together with their hopeless incarceration of difference within the bars of a self-reproductive geometry, are all disturbing in a very modern way. It is no accident that Rubino's favourite geometrical shape is the sphere, evident here in dozens of particulars and details, from puppets' heads and cheeks to winches and bolts. Combined with the recurring image of the cog-wheel and the constant presence of what Rubino himself calls 'un vero arsenale meccanico', these objects do not merely symbolize a Futurist 'modernolatry' but (most important) prepare both the figural and psychological spaces of a veritable 'machinolatry' (p. 5 ).'9 It is significant, in fact, that Tic e Tac ends with the disquieting rebellion of puppets against humans, framed in a frozen, moonlit scene where blood, sighs, and yells are 18 'Uomini, donne, bimbi e fantocci facevano il giro tondo intorno al piede degli alberi con una gioia, con una frenesia indescrivibili' (p. 39). Compare this, in particular, with Depero's 'Ballo di diavoli, equilibristi e ballerine di gomma' ( 1919), part of his 'Teatro Magico'. 19 Umberto Boccioni had coined the Futurist term 'modernolatry'. 4o03</page><page sequence="10">Antonio Rubino: Futurist Manque used unsparingly. Even without dwelling on the psychoanalytic implications of self- aware, sneering puppets waking up to eliminate their human creators, this Inferno- like scene reveals the author's preoccupation with the future of an increasingly industrial society where machines are constantly challenging nature. For the short-cuts they create between outside and inside and their verbal predilection for chains of analogies, Tic and Tac finally prefigure another significant aspect in Rubino's production, one related to Futurist 'paroliberismo', to objects intersecting sensations and vice versa. Rubino was both illustrator and poet, and these two activities complemented each other throughout his life. As an entirely self- taught illustrator, he was able to incorporate suggestions from a wide range of sources, with a preference for the art nouveau line, while at the same time maintaining a highly individual style. As a poet, he was also entirely self-taught and moved from positions that can generically be ascribed to French symbolism and decadentism.20 His oblique and often alliterating, onomatopoeic verses, together with his habit of questioning the typographic layout of the page, testify to his awarness of a linguistic crisis as well as his desire to experiment with linguistic structures and paradigms. As emerges from his memoir, his aesthetic hobbyhorse was exploring the 'twilight zone' between word and image, experimenting with what he called 'ideograms'. In Albertarelli's words: 'Al limite della parola egli [Rubino] scopre l'ideogramma, come se andasse a ritroso nell'evoluzione del linguaggio scritto, e sviluppa l'ideogramma in disegno puro, che dovrebbe assorbire la parola e renderla superflua.'21 Rubino pursued this 'ideographic' principle throughout, devising ways of welding together visual and verbal experiences, investing words with iconic as well as musical significance and maintaining a constant reciprocity between sign and meaning, word and image.22 A good example of this is a poem he composed for an adult readership dated 7 December 9o0I: San-kuoei-kin-kau Kouan-in tai-ki iin-yang yu-en ku fang wan-tse jou-hi Gin-gin Kouan-in ta-sien kan-tau san-kouei-kin-kau Kouan-in gin-gin. These rhyming and alliterating quatrains are exquisitely meaningless: their fin-de- siecle parodistic orientalism is conveyed by way of appropriate yet meaningless phonemes. Even though Rubino is always reluctant to relinquish versification, he 20 It is worthy of note that Rubino's mother was French and that he grew up completely bilingual in Italian and French. His familiarity with the language not only facilitated cultural contacts with France but also ensured that Rubino was, as much as Marinetti himself, capable of writing poetry in French. 21 R. Albertarelli, 'Antonio Rubino owero l'antifumetto', in Comics: Salone Internazionale dei comics Istituto di Pedagogia dell'Universita di Roma (Bordighera: Comune di Bordighera, I965). Albertarelli, however, hastens to add: 'Ma l'esperimento riesce solo fino a un certo punto, perche egli non potra mai disgiungere le sue immagini da un discorso.' 22 This principle applies also to the octosyllabic lines that invariably complement Rubino's illustrations in the Corriere dei Piccoli. Incidentally, Rubino had a definite dislike for 'balloons': his characters may talk in the most bizarre fashion, but only at the bottom of the page and always rigorously in octosyllabic verse. 404</page><page sequence="11">KATIA PIZZI aims to deconstruct his poetry through surreal and nonsensical means. His linguistic experimentation springs from a desire to exorcise the mystique of language and play games with it, returning words to their freedom, in a way similar to the celebrated Futurist 'parole in liberta'. Rubino's favourite rhetorical devices include accumulation, analogy, and repeti- tion. Onomatopoeia abounds: one of his most often-quoted lines, the almost demented 'squaquarar di squarquattole squarquoie', was a favourite of Rubino, who employed it on numerous occasions.23 Significantly, Rubino was also very well versed in music, although the greater part of his music was never played in public.24 Rubino's poetry is, as much as his graphics, baroque and centrifugal, jutting out in a number of divergent directions, dispersing in rivulets, apparently idle particulars and details, and yet legitimizing his original analogic rapports with other artistic forms.25 It is precisely this contamination of poetry with music and image that helps to reconnect Rubino to Futurism. Nationalism and the enthusiasm for interventionism, understood both ideo- logically and artistically, are other interests shared by Rubino and the Futurists. Rubino partook of the enthusiam for intervention common to many contemporary intellectuals, and enlisted as a voluntary soldier in the First World War. The magazine La Tradotta, edited by Renato Simoni and written and illustrated by Rubino between 1918 and 19I9, lends a humorous voice to the national cause by way of its satirical punch-lines, Rubino's sharp drawings in black and white, and the accompaniment of the familiar octosyllabic verses. Satire and the grotesque serve patriotic and propaganda interests in this magazine designed for a wide readership of ordinary soldiers and officers alike, yet an acute sense of hardship as experienced in the trenches is also rendered in vivid and realistic detail.26 Rubino's commitment to pro-Italian nationalism, however, never seemed to translate into genuine enthusiasm for later Fascist developments, possibly giving way instead to a progressive sense of disillusionment.27 Rubino did contribute to Fascist periodicals and was for many years on the payroll of the publishers Mondadori, but his relationship with the regime appears to have been difficult, leading to frequent clashes with Fascist censorship and occasional dismissals 'for political reasons'. The impression is that Rubino kept well to the margins of the Fascist experience, unlike what happened to much of the post-war Futurist 23 This line became, amongst other things, the title of an article by Dr Alpha, 'Squaquarar di squarquattole squarquoie', Gazzetta del Popolo della Domenica, 25 June I 9 I. In a footnote to his collection Versi e disegni (Milan: SELGA, 191 I), p. 2 I 5, Rubino defined a 'squarquattola' as a 'parola vanilingue, quasi diminutivo aggettivato di squarquoia'. 24 Besides the literary implications of this interest, it would be profitable to compare Rubino's musical scores with the 'art of noise' of the Futurists. 25 See the 'scherzo' entitled 'LOdigiotto' ('Giotto's circle' becomes here a full name: 'Odigiotto'). This tells the story of a painter, Mr Odigiotto, who is shaped as a perfect circle. In the attempt to draw his self-portrait, Mr Odigiotto remains forever glued to the pages and becomes any other 'Giotto's O'. The divide between 'O' understood as iconic sign and '0' the letter in the alphabet is blurred here and the reciprocity between the two is repeatedly, ifjokingly, reinstated. 26 See Claudio Bertieri, 'Tavole "all'italiana"', La Riviera Ligure, 7 (1920), 15-22 (p. 20): 'Rubino riesce a dimostrare come la sua vena satirica e l'adesione al grottesco possano agilmente convivere con la sollecitazione patriottica e - se vogliamo -anche con l'impegno propagandistico.' Rubino's soldiers derive from a celebrated character invented for II Corriere dei Piccoli: 'Italino', a staunchly patriotic boy living in the Trentino and perpetually engaged in playing nasty jokes at the expense of the ruling Austro-German authorities. 27 This is, however, somewhat difficult to assess and very little in Rubino's correspondence and private papers sheds light on this aspect of his thought. 405</page><page sequence="12">Antonio Rubino: Futurist Manque leadership, who ended up embracing it. His character Lio, 'balillino della prima ora', created in I927, was one of Mussolini's favourites, as transpires from some correspondence between Rubino and the publisher Enrico Bemporad of Florence. This did not, however, prevent Rubino from being ousted from II Balilla in 1929, the periodical where Lio first appeared. Lio fell from grace as his attitude became progressively too scornful and ironical (too irreverent, in a word) to continue to enjoy the approval of the regime, which eventually decided to suppress him. Rubino's official note of dismissal significantly reads, 'si scorgono allusioni e suggerimenti pericolosi'.28 Last but not least, I come to Rubino's contribution to cinema. He became actively involved in the late I930s, at least a couple of decades after the publication of the 'Manifesto of Futurist Cinema' of 19 6 and somewhat late in his own life.29 Cinema, and specifically the cinema of cartoon animation, provided him with an opportunity to apply and adapt his highly individual style to an entirely new medium. It persuaded him to tone down his sharply angular and geometrical line into a softer, more rounded style, but without abandoning his familiar and traditional octosyllabic verse. In 1940 he submitted to the Minculpop a Progetto per la produzione di cartoni animati italiani.30 Here he advocated a cinema of cartoon animation as an 'arte assolutamente nuova' as well as the production of films long enough to do it justice. Italy was in fact lagging behind in this art, which remained very much experimental and relied on the black-and-white, rather tentative cartoons by Liborio Pensuti, while American contemporaries such as Walt Disney were already well versed in the use of technicolor and had already produced long films such as Snow White and Pinocchio. Rubino was always highly sceptical and ultimately rejected the Disneyan model because of the dogma of imitation and verisimilitude embraced by Disney and his school. Faithful to his 'Futuristic' roots and aware of the innovations brought by Surrealist cinema, Rubino declared: 'Ho in questi ultimi anni studiato a fondo il problema, realizzando pubblicita luminose animate, cartoni e provini' (quoted in Laura, p. 48). His main concern, he maintained, was music, particularly the development of a technique whereby he could incorporate music effectively into cinematic images. In this connection, it is important to record his invention of a 'macchina da presa sinalloscopica' whose main function, as indicated in the patent papers, was to facilitate the interweaving of colour, music, and images on the screen, which Rubino employed extensively, particularly in his last film, L'arco dei sette colori. Rubino appears to be making implicit reference here to the Manifesto 'The Futurist Cinema 1916', and its determination to find suitable expression 'through the cinema, through great tables of words-in-freedom and mobile illuminated 28 See their private correspondence, passim. The note referred in particular to a remake of one of Aesop's fables Rubino was preparing for the same periodical.

Laura, who describes Rubino's contribution to cartoon animation as 'non indifferente' ('Antonio Rubino e il film d'animazione italiano', in Catalogo della mostra L'Amico Delle Nuvole, pp. 46-53 (p. 46)). Rubino's cinematic experimentalism partakes of the same climate that bred 'la Novelli film', an enterprise attempted by the contemporary children's author Yambo (Enrico Novelli). In his unpublished memoirs (1960), Rubino includes Yambo amongst his collaborators but fails to specify the nature and extent of this cooperation. It would be interesting to find out whether the two had discussed cinema together, even if they had not actually collaborated in some film. 30 'Minculpop' stands for 'Ministero della Cultura Popolare', the Fascist Ministry of Popular Culture. 406</page><page sequence="13">KATIA PIZZI signs'.31 Other phrases from the Manifesto also find an echo in Rubino's project: 'The most varied elements will enter into Futurist film as expressive means: from the slice of life to the streak of colour, from the conventional line to words-in- freedom, from chromatic and plastic music to the music of objects [. ..]. Our films will be [. .] linear, plastic, chromatic equivalences, etc., of men, women, events, thoughts, music, feelings, weights, smells, noises' (pp. 208, 218).32 These principles, in combination with the musical ones expressed in the 'Art of Noise' (I 913) by Luigi Russolo, undoubtedly influenced Rubino's perception and approach to cartoon animation. They do not merely echo almost word for word Rubino's own utopic/ dystopic version of the future of advertising as drafted in his Cronache delfuturo but also coincide with Rubino's convictions that 'a differenza del cinema dal vero, il cinema di animazione doveva partire dalla musica, non concepita dunque come elemento aggiunto, come commento, ma come elemento espressivo di base, sul quale il disegno doveva calibrare il suo ritmo di racconto' (Laura, pp. 46-47).33 In other words, music, including the 'art of noise', becomes the privileged medium for weaving together the images and rhythm of the story. Once again, Rubino is paying homage to an ideal of reciprocal conversion or combination of different artistic means. Such principles are employed extensively in Rubino's first short film, Nelpaese dei ranocchi (I942), the first cartoon animation in colour ever produced in Italy and winner of the first prize ex aequo at the Venice Film Festival of the same year.34 Music, composed specially by Raffaele Gervasio, plays a central role in this film, as well as in Rubino's second and more sophisticated film Crescendo rossiniano (I943), which was destroyed by a bombardment that burned down the Berlin Agfa plant where the film was being developed and printed. Extant documentation confirms that Crescendo rossiniano consolidated Rubino's technique and allowed him to apply fully his somewhat 'rumorista' convictions in an attempt to render music 'visual'.35 To use the words of Ernesto Laura, 'linee e colori giocano un ruolo essenziale, in una fantasmagoria che alterna immagini astratte a visualizzazioni' (p. 52). Two later projects failed to reach fruition: the first was to be entited Toto uomo meccanico, and Rubino's notes reveal that Toto was conceived as an angular robot, a triumph of machinery in a performance strikingly similar to the robotic ballet 'Agony of the Machine' devised by the Futurist Ivo Pannaggi in 1922. This was to be followed by Ilpastorello e i nani, for which no records exist. Particularly worthy of note is, however, his last film, L'arco dei sette colori (I955), directed by Gualtiero Boffini, where Rubino continued to marry explosions of light and colour with music with the aid of his newly created 'macchina da presa sinalloscopica'. This is also an 31 Quoted in Futurist Manifestos, ed. by Umbro Apollonio (London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1973), p. 207. 32 See also: 'Cinema must become antigraceful, deforming, impressionistic, synthetic, dynamic, free-wording' (p. 208). 33 Compare Rubino: 'Alla pubblicita luminosa mobile si aggiungeranno la musica sincopata dei colori, la folgorazione ottica, l'aurora boreale a scritte policrome; agli altoparlanti si aggiungeranno i rimbombanti, gli urlomodulatori e i petardi a esplosioni multiple' ('Un cataclisma pubblicitario (dall'anno 1999 al 2003)', in Le cronache delfuturo). The 'rimbombanti' and 'urlomodulatori' described by Rubino are close relations of the 'intonarumori', 'scoppiatore', and 'ululatore' devised by Russolo in order to confer musical status on noise. 34 The original film lasted twenty minutes and was shown in full exclusively at the 1942 Venice Film Festival. Later, it was cut down to its present length of a mere three minutes. 35 'Da quel che se ne sa [Crescendo rossiniano] doveva constituire un rilevante passo avanti rispetto a "Nel paese dei ranocchi" ' (Laura, p. 5 ). 4o07</page><page sequence="14">Antonio Rubino. Futurist Manque 'inno fantasioso alla luce sposa del sole, e ai colori dell'arcobaleno loro figli'.36 The abstract and complex dynamics of sound, colour, and movement make indirect reference to Depero's experimental theatre, such as the plays Colori (I916) and Ombre ( 1918), which were entirely based on abstract and experimental manipulations of lights, colours, and sounds. Colori and Ombre prefigure one of Depero's most significant if unrealized experiences, that of 'Teatro Magico' (1919-25), where angular and mechanical puppets, protagonists of 'Teatro Plastico' (i 91 7-18), are replaced by rounded, light-capturing characters, cast in absurd situations, in an attempt to defeat the unity of space and time. In this respect, Rubino's development from the angular puppets of Quadratino and Tic e Tac, to the psychological and graphic experimentalism of Pierino il burattino and his abstract paintings such as II rimpianto, down to his highly 'colorista' and 'rumorista' cinema, follows a cognate though later path.37 L'arco dei sette colori is, however, also presently unavailable, probably buried in one of Metro Goldwin Mayer's archives of the Cold War years.38 To summarize and conclude, Rubino not only eschewed direct involvement with Futurism but also rejected some of its most extreme conclusions, such as its urban radicalism, 'aeropittura', and others. He shunned particualrly subsequent com- promises with the Fascist Establishment that involved much of the postwar Futurist leadership. He was however susceptible to many Futurist suggestions and influences, together with Futurist nightmares and temptations, which he tempered and transformed into his own extremely invidual style. In particular, he kept all artistic shools, including Futurism, at bay by means of his corrosive, deconstructing, and self-deconstructing sense of humour. Rubino's response to Futurist siren songs was a rebellious, Palazzeschi-like retort: 'E lasciatemi divertire.'39 UNIVERSITY OF KENT KATIA PIZZI 36 Piero Zanotto, L'ltalia di cartone (Padua: Liviana, 1973), quoted in Laura, p. 53. 37 For Depero's theatre, see Depero Teatro Magico, ed. by Gabriella Belli and others (Milan: Electa, I989), passim. 38 As discussed in an interview with Antonietta Cutini. 39 The research contained in this article was carried out with the aid of two small research grants awarded to me by the Humanities Research Board of the British Academy and the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Kent at Canterbury.
