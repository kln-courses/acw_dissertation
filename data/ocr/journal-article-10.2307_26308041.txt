Stone Department of Art History, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wl 53201, USA Abstract Rubber had important utilitarian, symbolic, and ritual roles in ancient Mesoamerica. Among the latter is the use of rubber balls as burnt offerings. This paper examines characteristic iconographic manifestations of rubber-ball offerings in Mesoamerican art. One of these, the spiral, seen in the Postclassic Maya codices, is shown to have had greater temporal and geographic distribution than previously thought. Another is the Standard Rubber Offering, a widespread motif in Mesoamerican art that links rubber balls to feathers and rope bindings. In considering why rubber balls were shown bound in rope, the paper examines the physical properties of natural rubber. Understanding the iconographic nuances of rubber balls as ritual offerings sheds new light on the symbolism of rubber balls in ballgame scenes and allows identification of certain images as rubber balls that were previously unrecognized. Among the many wonders seen by early European explorers in the New World was rubber. The explorers marveled at its properties. It could be made into water-repellent clothing and footwear; into hollow replicas when objects were dipped in latex, which was observed in the Amazon (Kaminitz 1988:144); and into sporting balls that could rebound to remarkable heights. The bearded strang ers quickly saw the commercial potential of such a malleable material. Yet this potential would not be fully realized until more than two centuries after Columbus first spotted Tainos playing with rubber balls on the island of Hispaniola. Commercial viabil ity awaited the botanical and scientific study of rubber, which did not begin in earnest until the mid-eighteenth century. The discovery of vulcanization in 1839 ushered in an era of wide spread industrial applications of rubber. Embraced by the Indus trial Revolution, rubber could be seen in the latest inventions, from the mackintosh to the belts, hoses, and gaskets driving a new generation of machinery. Some wide-eyed enthusiasts attempted to pave entire streets with rubber. Even the term "rubber" comes from one of the material's innumerable handy uses: rubbing out pencil marks. What we know about the European encounter with rubber and its early industrial development largely concerns events in South America (Boston Woven Hose and Rubber Company 1916; Hauser 1930; Tudor 1947; Seeligmann et al. 1903; Semegen 1973). The rubber industry took root in the southern latitudes. Consequently, the species of rubber tree indigenous to the Amazon and Orinoco basins, Hevea brasiliensis, was adopted for large-scale rubber pro duction around the world. Scientific and commercial interests in Mexican rubber seem to have been more sporadic (Valdés and Flores 1986). In the eighteenth century, the Spanish experimented with Mexican rubber to see whether they could make imperme able containers for the transatlantic shipment of mercury, a mate rial used in silver extraction that was hard to store (Lowe and Reis 1944). The modern perception of natural rubber as a common indus trial material is a far cry from how rubber was viewed in ancient Mesoamerica. There, rubber may have played a more complex role than in any other region of the preindustrial world. The fact that the Aztecs obtained rubber as tribute from two provinces— Tochtepec along the southern Gulf Coast, from whence they re ceived 16,000 balls of rubber annually, and Tlapan in eastern Guerrero—attests to its economic importance (Berdan 1996:128, Table 5-6; Berdan and Anawalt 1992:2:86, 112). Although rubber had mundane uses in Mesoamerica, it was valued in ways unimag inable to the modern Western consumer, because its ritual and symbolic roles outstripped in importance its impressive array of utilitarian applications. In the ritual practices of ancient Meso america, rubber assumed the unlikely role of a burnt sacrificial offering, a role it shared with three other substances: blood, copal incense, and bark paper. Indeed, these materials were so closely affiliated as burnt offerings that they were often burned together, at times blended and at other times spattered on one another. In the secluded forests of Chiapas, some groups of Lacandon ritually burned rubber, paper, copal, and blood as recently as the 1970s (Bruce 1973; Davis 1978), testimony to the remarkable tenacity of this ancient sacrificial complex. In studies of the ritual life of Mesoamericans, rubber has received less attention than other types of burnt offerings (see, however, Vesca Treviño 1986 and Carreón Blaine 1997; the latter, unfortunately, was not available for consultation). Rubber objects are relatively uncommon in Mesoamerican archaeological inven tories. Many were consumed in flaming braziers; their scarcity may also stem from rubber's susceptibility to chemical and bio logical degradation (Allington 1988; Baker 1998). Dorothy Hos ier, Sandra L. Burkett, and Michael J. Tarkanian (1999:1988) estimate the total number of archaeological specimens in exis tence from Mesoamerica to be a few hundred. Many come from submerged contexts, such as the Chichen Itza Sacred Cenote 21</page><page sequence="2">22 Stone (Coggins and Ladd 1992) and the spring at El Manatí (Ortiz and Rodriguez 1994). At the other end of the time spectrum, the eth nographic record makes little mention of rubber in accounts of Mesoamerican ritual practices. Whereas incense burning survived the Conquest and still flourishes, the practice of burning rubber rapidly disappeared. The divergent histories of rubber and incense can be explained by the "permissibility of the familiar" in which certain pre-Columbian religious practices blended into, and thereby survived the transition to, colonial culture (Nolan 1991:44). The familiar custom of burning incense was tolerated by European Catholics, who surely frowned on the strange practice of burning rubber. There are no references to Mesoamericans ritually burning rubber after the sixteenth century, apart from the Lacandon men tioned earlier, who are unique in having direct access to rubber trees and, in their isolated villages, great freedom to pursue pre Conquest religion. With diminishing demand, rubber production and trade routes must have dried up. Trade was essential as the species of rubber tree exploited in Mesoamerica, Castilla elastica, grows only in the humid tropics at elevations below 700 meters (Ochoa Castillo 1992:29; Sánchez-Martínez 1995:82), making it unavailable in many highland regions except through long distance trade. The importance of rubber may be underappreciated not only because of the limited archaeological and ethnographic sources but also because of rubber's vague identity in ancient Mesoamer ican art when it is not contextualized by a ballgame scene. This paper provides an overview of the social and cultural role of rub ber in ancient Mesoamerica, then attempts to grapple with the iconographic issues surrounding the visual record of rubber balls in Mesoamerican art. The finer points of this iconography are well worth exploring, as they open new interpretations that pertain to the ballgame and other themes in which rubber is characteristi cally present. THE UTILITARIAN ROLE OF RUBBER IN MESOAMERICA The Aztecs called rubber olli, the origin of the modern Mexican word hule. Olli is defined in a dictionary of sixteenth-century Nahuatl as "cierta goma de arboles medicinal, de que hazen pelo tas para jugar con las nalgas" (Molina 1944:76). As the defini tion implies, rubber was recognized for its medicinal properties and was consumed for a variety of ailments. Francisco Clavigero (cited in Lowe and Ries 1944:39) indicates that a medicinal oil was extracted from melted rubber. Ralph Roys (1976:254) notes that the Maya used both raw and boiled latex in their medicinal concoctions. In central Mexico, rubber (presumably in the form of latex) was consumed as a remedy for hoarseness (Sahagún 1950 1982:Book 10:145) and to loosen the chest gripped by a cold (Torquemada 1977:4:430). It was sometimes mixed with choco late (Sahagún 1950-1982:Book 10:145), probably to improve the taste, like the proverbial "spoonful of sugar." Bernardino de Sa hagún (1950-1982:Book 10:154) notes such a formula to combat the "spitting of blood." The Codex Cruz-Badiano mentions the treatment of dysentery with an enema prepared with latex (cited in Martínez Cortés 1986:99). The Maya also treated dysentery with a potion containing rubber and used it for the topical treatment of burns (Roys 1976:254-255). Juan de Torquemada (1977:4:430) mentions drinking latex to stop bloody diarrhea. The modern Hua stecs use dried latex as a forehead plaster to treat head and tooth pain and drink latex dissolved in water to alleviate other ailments (Alcorn 1984:584). Rubber had other practical uses. Among the ancient Maya, rubber was employed as an adhesive for hafting axes (Coggins and Ladd 1992:356) and projectile points (Roys 1965:63; Tozzer 1957:145). Diego de Landa states that rubber was placed on the tip of a stick used to beat certain hollow log drums (Tozzer 1941:93). In central Mexico, capes were waterproofed with rub ber (Torquemada 1977:4:430) and, according to Clavigero (cited in Lowe and Ries 1944:40), ancient central Mexicans used rubber to waterproof battle gear. The Aztec nobility wore rubber sandals (Ochoa Castillo 1992:28), as did the historic Olmecs, described in the Florentine Codex (Sahagún 1950-1982:Book 10:188), whose very name speaks of the rubber at their disposal. Aztec lords made dwarves stumble around in oversized rubber sandals to provide amusement for the royal court (Torquemada 1977:4:430). Appar ently, the Classic Maya used latex to waterproof cloth. A recent discovery at Calakmul, Campeche, revealed a latex-impregnated cloth serving as a shroud in a royal burial (Carrasco et al. 1999:53). RUBBER IN MESOAMERICAN RITUAL AND SYMBOLISM The ritual uses of rubber in ancient Mesoamerica are far better known than the practical ones, especially to anyone who has read the Florentine Codex. There one learns that the Aztecs applied rubber to all manner of ritual paraphernalia, even the oars of a boat transporting offerings during the feast of Etzalcualiztli (Sa hagún 1950-1982:Book 2:79; also mentioned in Vesca Treviño 1986:37). Most common was the application of what appears to be a liquid form of processed rubber to the attire of gods and their human impersonators. This included coating the lips, face, or en tire body with rubber. The use of rubber as body decoration is alluded to in a spell recorded by Hernando Ruiz de Alarcón, which refers to priests by the metaphorical couplet "the rubber-speckled ones, the rubber-spattered ones" (Coe and Whittaker 1982:123). One of the principal burnt offerings of Aztec ritual, rubber spattered paper, was fashioned into ritual vestments such as crowns, shirts, and skirts, sometimes miniaturized and arrayed on tiny dough figures. Youths sacrificed for the feast of Atlcahualo wore rubber sandals and paper streamers daubed with rubber (Sahagún 1950-1982:Book 2:44). One intriguing use present in both Aztec and Maya culture is the molding of rubber into small human and animal figures. The Aztecs molded human figures into rubber gods, or ulteteu (Sa hagún 1950-l982:Book 6:85). These arcane objects are listed as part of the tribute payment of the province of Tlapan (Berdan and Anawalt 1992:2:86). The ancient Maya also fashioned rubber fig ures; some (in human and animal form) were found in the Sacred Cenote of Chichen Itza (Coggins and Ladd 1992:355; Tozzer 1941:143. note 679; Tozzer 1957:197). The making of rubber fig ures among the Lacandon is mentioned as early as the sixteenth century (Thompson 1952), and they continued to be made into the twentieth century (Bruce 1973; Davis 1978:132-159; McGee 1990:91; Tozzer 1907:127), one of the few surviving ritual uses of rubber in Mesoamerica. Rubber occurs in more than 200 species of plants, even in certain types of dandelions (Semegen 1973:152), and it is possible that the Lacandon extract latex from several different plant mate rials. Virginia Davis (1978:132) claims that what the northern Lacandon call rubber derives from a flowering grass called</page><page sequence="3">Spirals, ropes, and feathers 23 hutikin. Robert Bruce (1973:27) mentions a vine called huutkih, the juice of which is added to latex as a coagulant. These terms sound suspiciously close, though the authors apparently are de scribing different plants. Be that as it may, the Lacandon are known to extract latex from Castilla elástico. This is documented not only in Bruce (1973) but also in a story about two brothers who go out to collect rubber from a tree as an offering for their mother (Boremanse 1986:307-313). Bruce (1973) offers detailed information about the production and symbolism of rubber figures among the western Lacandon. Once burned, the figures are believed to be transformed into male and female servants of the gods who receive them in the upper world (Davis 1978:25). Various types of rubber figures are pro duced. Among the northern Lacandon. the ceremony renewing the god pots (ritual incense burners) involves burning a one-foot-high rubber figure (Davis 1978:75), although the common type, at tached to a copal offering board, is only an inch or so high (Davis 1978:135). According to Davis, when the small rubber figures are burned, they reach the heavenly Otherworld and there expand to the appropriate size to act as servants. This accords with the prin ciple that offerings may change their size, number, quality, or substance once they enter the god's abode. Among the Lacandon, copal becomes maize dough to feed the gods (Davis 1978:Table 4), while among the Tzotzil of Zincantán the smoke of copal is said to become cigarettes for the gods (Vogt 1976:49). The perceived transformations of burnt offerings seem to have local interpreta tions, as they probably did in pre-Columbian times. Most likely among the ancient Maya burned rubber was transformed into a blood offering, perhaps a human heart, for the gods. Rubber had some widespread symbolic associations in Mesoamerica—for instance, with rain and mountain gods. The black color of cured rubber linked it with the complex of black rain gods. Moreover, burning rubber produces thick black smoke that evoked rain-bringing storm clouds (Brundage 1985:122; Thompson 1971:113). Today, Nahuatl villagers of Amatlán, Vera cruz, conceive of dwarf-like rain gods called pilhuehuentsitsij who wear rubber jackets and are black "like the clouds" (Sandstrom 1991:249-250). Another important association of rubber is with blood. The Aztecs viewed rubber as the blood of trees (Brundage 1985:122; Vesca Treviño 1986:41). The inspiration of this belief is easily imagined, since rubber flows from a wounded tree just as blood flows from a human. Latex extraction is known popularly in Mex ico today as "bleeding" (Valdés and Flores 1986:89), perhaps a holdover from an earlier era. In a similar vein, the Lacandon refer to the process of coagulating rubber as "killing" it (Bruce 1973:27). The parallel between blood and rubber was pervasive in Aztec ritual. Rubber-spattered paper and blood-soaked paper were both burned in braziers. The Aztecs made a ritual dough called yoli aimtlaqualoz, a mixture of rubber, blood, and ground seeds (Vesca Treviño 1986:37-38). That rubber was equated with blood for the Maya is seen in words for "rubber" in Mayan languages that are the same as that used for blood, such as the Yucatec k'ik' (Barrera Vásquez 1980:399) and the Quiche kiq' (Edmonson 1965:59), terms that encompass both latex and solid rubber. There is a degree of cross cultural universality in the rubber-blood equation; indeed, before it was used as a botanical term in English to refer to the milky sap of a tree, the word "latex" had an earlier scientific use in which it referred to the watery portion of blood or other bodily secretions (Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary 1971:1:1576). However, in Mesoamerica, the blood-rubber linkage had deep cultural reverberations. Bruce (1973:29-30) emphasizes its signif icance among the modern Lacandon and notes that rubber figures are always accompanied by blood-associated red materials, such as ground achiote (k'uxu) and red-dyed bands of amate paper (chak hu'un; lit., "red paper"). In addition, Bruce (1973:30) mentions a ritual that in the 1970s was known only to elder Lacandon, and thus has probably fallen into disuse, in which rubber animal fig ures were soaked in blood from the cut earlobes of participants in a curing ceremony. The bloody rubber figures were subsequently burned as offerings. Similarly, Davis (1978:158) notes that anthro pomorphic figures made for the Lacandon god Hachakyum and animal figures made for Mensabok and K'ak' were painted in blood drawn from the nasal septa of ritual participants. The blood was said to bring the figures to life. Jon McGee (1990:91) states that, in Naja, k'uxu substitutes for blood, as bloodletting is no longer practiced. But the symbolic relationship between rubber and blood persists. Among the Maya, rubber may have been a blood substitute. In the Popol Vuh, the sap of a tree is molded into a substitute heart for the maiden Xquic as a ruse to spare her life. The burning sap heart produces a sweet aroma that intoxicates the Lords of the Underworld. Although the sap cited in this passage is typically identified as that of a croton tree (Edmonson 1971:79: Tedlock 1985:116), it also has properties of rubber, in that the sap swells into a ball, according to the Quiche text. Coalescing into a ball is precisely what rubber does when latex is mixed with certain plant juices, a type of rubber processing that was practiced in ancient Mesoamerica (as discussed later). Among the modern Tzotzil, co pal can substitute for a blood offering, such as a slain chicken (Gary Gossen, personal communication, 1999). In ancient times, rubber may have served as a substitute for a living sacrifice. This may explain why sacrificial imagery of skulls and captives are seen inside rubber balls in Maya ballgame scenes. The fact that rubber had strong conceptual parallels with the human body, es pecially with the heart and blood, further accounts for the frequent personification of rubber objects in Mesoamerican art. Rubber and copal are closely related conceptually and func tionally. Both are considered the "blood" of trees and produce a strong aroma when burned. Even though burning rubber may not appeal to our senses, it does not smell like burning tires, the bad odor of which comes from the sulfur used in vulcanization. The smoke of burning copal and rubber shared the quality of being appealing fragrances that were especially attractive to the gods. This relationship is captured in an Aztec epithet for the gods, "lords of rubber, lords of incense, lords of copal" (Sahagún 1950 1982:Book 6:35). Rubber and copal were often burned together. In describing the religion of the sixteenth-century Pipil, Diego Garcia de Palacio (1860:32) states that they burned the heart of a deer with copal and rubber "as incense to the idol of the god who was to be the protector of hunting and fishing." In the early twen tieth century, the Lacandon mixed rubber and copal in a burnt offering called k 'ik'iluka (Tozzer 1907:102). The offerings dredged from the Sacred Cenote of Chichen Itza revealed many combining copal and rubber. Clemency Chase Coggins and John M. Ladd (1992:354) note that rubber ignites more easily than copal and could have been used as a starter fuel. That this is possible is shown in highland Guatemala, where pieces of old rubber tires are used to burn copal tablets; one method is to embed the rubber in the tablet (Nikolai Grube, personal communication, 1999). Dredged from the Chichen Cenote were balls of copal completely encap</page><page sequence="4">24 Stone sulated in rubber and others wrapped in strands of rubber that may have served as fuel (Coggins and Ladd 1992:Figure 9.13). Many wooden objects recovered from the Cenote were decorated with copal covered with a skin of rubber (Coggins and Ladd 1992:355); here the rubber may have protected the less weather-resistant copal. THE ICONOGRAPHY OF RUBBER BALLS Although the discussion thus far makes it clear that rubber was important in the ritual life of ancient Mesoamericans, the iconog raphy of rubber in non-ballgame contexts has not been examined in much detail, one reason being that rubber is not always easy to identify. For instance, rubber may be difficult to distinguish from copal because both are round and were burned in much the same fashion. Although copal varies in color from dark brown to a translucent yellow, it was conventionally shown in Mesoamerican art as yellow pellets or egg-size balls piled in a heap in an offering bowl or censer. Rubber balls, by contrast, are conventionally shown as dark, round objects about half the size of a bowling ball; usu ally, one is present in an offering (Figure 1). A carved Late Classic Zapotee panel in a private collection shows a rare instance of copal and rubber being burned together in an hourglass brazier (Figure 2). The single large ball is rubber, and the two smaller balls flanking it are copal, and they appear to emit distinct kinds of smoke. But rubber-ball iconography takes less obvious forms. In the Postclassic Maya codices, rubber balls are represented as tight Figure I. Rubber ball burns in a brazier (detail of a painted Late Classic Maya vase; Kerr Vessel K.7716, drawn after Kerr 2001:1003). Figure 2. Brazier contains a rubber ball flanked by copai pellets (enhanced in the drawing; Late Classic Zapotee panel, private collection, redrawn from Urcid 1992). black spirals, usually shown surrounded by flames arching from a brazier (Figure 3a). What this spiral signified has not always been clear to students of the Maya. Alfred Tozzer (1941:75, note 338) identified it as copal. Decades later, J. Eric Thompson (1962:204, 1972:99), who catalogued the spiral as the glyph T577, suggested that it represented water in light of its similarity to whirlpools shown in Central Mexican codices. Yet this made little sense in the context of burning rituals. Then, in 1973, Floyd Lounsbury posited that the spiral represented rubber. Having identified the glyph for copal as something other than a spiral, he reasoned that the spiral must represent another type of burnt offering. Consid ering those mentioned in Landa, he concluded: "Since rubber was apparently the one second in importance after copal, this sign may stand for the ball of rubber" (Lounsbury 1973:113). He further argued that the spiral was an allusion to a form of processing rubber in smoked rolled sheets or strips. Although the practice of smoking rubber has not been documented in Mesoamerica, that of forming rubber balls from wound strips is known archaeologically (Ortiz and Rodriguez 1994:Figure 5.26) and ethnohistorically (Torquemada 1977:4:429). Any lingering doubts about the sound ness of Lounsbury's arguments were completely dispelled by Ste phen Houston's (1983:27) identification of a ballcourt scene in the Dresden Codex in which the rubber ball is represented as a spiral (Figure 3b). Given the context, this interpretation is unequivocal. I have found two polychrome vases that demonstrate that the equation of a spiral with a rubber ball also existed in Late Classic Maya iconography. In one case, a painted váse pictures a large black ball with a human head and legs (Figure 4). The black disk can be identified as a rubber ball not only by its color and shape</page><page sequence="5">Spirals, ropes, and feathers 25 Figure 3. [a] Spiral representing a rubber ball burns in a spiked censer (Madrid 39c, afterVillacorta andVillacorta 1977); [b] spiral, set within the walls of a ballcourt, represents a gaming ball (Dresden 41a, after Villacorta and Villacorta 1977]. but also by the fact that it is wrapped in a cord, a motif frequently accompanying rubber balls, as will be discussed later. The associ ated text opens with a black ball infixed with a spiral, followed by a sky glyph (T561), phonetic na (T23), what may be a way variant (T539), and then winik, or "man" (T521:102). In my view, the text uses a spiral infixed within a ball as a logograph for the pictured object. The anthropomorphic ball appears to be a "rubber ball sky man" who is a way, or supernatural co-essence (Houston and Stu art 1989). Nikolai Grube and Werner Nahm (1994:711) include this figure in their list of way characters seen on Maya vases. They call him "man in the bundle," which they describe for this partic ular vase as the head and legs of a male figure coming out of a black circle that seems to represent a bundle or ball. Although they allude to the possibility that the black circle is a rubber ball, the authors do not consider the spiral a reference to it; instead, they read it as balan suffixed by T23 na. However, I feel that the contextual evidence warrants reading the spiral as a logograph for the ball. Indeed, another vase shows a related way character fusing a rubber ball and a spiral (Figure 5). Here, a ball infixed with a spiral forms the creature's body and names him in the first glyph in the accompanying text. These two vases indicate that a spiral could represent a rubber ball in Late Classic Maya art. In addition, spirals appear in other Classic Maya ballgame-related scenes and may subtly allude to a rubber ball. For instance, one vase shows a ballplayer with spirals decorating his costume (Kerr 1992:457). Another depicts a ball player wearing a hummingbird headdress (Scheie and Miller 1986:Plate 95a). The bird's beak turns into a tight spiral directly above the ball. Because this fantastic beak has no biological basis, Figure 4. A way character with body formed from a rubber ball encircled by a cord. He grasps the cord in his left hand. His glyphic name contains a spiral [detail of painted Late Classic Maya vase, Kerr Vase 3924, drawn after Kerr 1992:446).</page><page sequence="6">26 Stone f 1/ % Figure 5. A way character with body and giyphic name formed by a spiral [detail of painted Late Classic Maya vase, Kerr Vase 4908, drawn after Kerr 1994:609). it may be a visual pun for the ball itself. Another spiral associated with ballgame imagery can be seen in Monument 45, Copan (Fig ure 6), a stone sculpture of a rubber ball tied by a rope (Miller and Houston 1988:Figure 11). The top of the ball is carved with a channel resembling an open spiral with a depression at the center. The channel is generally interpreted as a conduit for blood offer ings (Baudez 1994:125). Although this function seems likely, the spiral may have been doing double duty as a symbol of a rubber ball. In non-ballgame contexts, we see a spiral on the snout of a fantastic zoomorphic mask worn by a dancer on an Ik '-style Late Classic vase (Reents-Budet 1994:Figure 5.2). This spiral most likely represents a rubber ball because it is shown as a thick black line and has no indications of being a shell, another association of the spiral. In its shell guise, the spiral usually has small protuber ances around the perimeter. The equation of a spiral with rubber may have been shared elsewhere in Mesoamerica, though again, it is rare in all cases except the Postclassic Maya codices. Borgia 35 and 42 show a ballgame scene in which the balls are inset with a gray spiral (Figure 7a). A possible Preclassic example occurs on Stela 11 from Kaminaljuyu, which depicts a figure standing between two smoking braziers. The one at the left has a scroll set in the center, possibly showing a ball of burning rubber (Figure 7b). One might ask why rubber balls are represented exclusively in the Maya codices by spirals, yet this symbolism is rare in other media. The spiral evidently provided a means of disambiguating rubber from other black substances portrayed in the codices, such as obsidian (see Madrid 36a-b, 75, 80, and 93b) and black paint (see Madrid 73b). Thus, the spiral could signify a dark round object, such as a rubber ball, in a way that did not just rely on color. The use of the spiral is rare in Classic art because the typical context for showing rubber balls, in ballgame scenes, is unambig uous. It seems that the spiral was part of the Maya's, and possibly other Mesoamerican groups', symbolic vocabulary for depicting a rubber ball, there to be used when needed. THE STANDARD RUBBER OFFERING In Mesoamerican art, rubber-ball offerings are shown in a conven tional iconographic configuration. The Offering Scene Mural from the now destroyed Temple of Agriculture, thought to date to a.d. 250 (Pasztory 1997:190), suggests that this conventional format derives from Teotihuacan. The mural shows three examples of rubber balls serving as sacrificial offerings. Of interest is the way the balls are represented: they are topped by a feather, below which is a knot (Figure 8). The latter is part of a binding represented as a white cross. This cluster of elements, which I will call the Stan dard Rubber Offering, occurs in profusion in the Postclassic Mix tec and Borgia Group codices, though with some minor differences. There the rubber ball is painted with a red spot and is topped by a red and white knot, cuplike element, and feather (Figure 9a). In terestingly, the adorning of copal offerings with feathers is men tioned in the Florentine Codex: "Some bore in their arms [pieces of] incense, quite round, conical [in shape]. On their points went erect quetzal feathers, called quetzal feather tassels" (Sahagún 1950-1982:Book 6:85). The feather topping the rubber ball may have been similar to this and most likely marked the ball as a precious object. The cuplike element may be a feather holder based on parallels with Maya examples of quetzal-feather bunches se</page><page sequence="7">Spirals, ropes, and feathers 27 Figure 6. Spiral and rope may symbolize a rubber-bali offering (Monu ment 45, Copan, Altar of Stela 4, drawn after Baudez l994:Figure 60). cured in a holder. Perhaps the red spot on the ball is blood or paint representing blood, whose connection with rubber has already been stressed. In the central Mexican codices, the binding of the ball is typi cally shown in an abbreviated fashion as just a knot or a knot coupled with a perimeter binding. On only rare occasions is the cross pattern present (Figure 9b). The ball usually rests on or is juxtaposed to what is essentially the fuel to burn it, a tied bundle of sticks (Figure 9a-c). The combination of the stick bundle and rubber ball occurs as early as Classic Zapotee art, in which carved panels show the rubber ball resting on a stack of flat objects, possibly an early version of the stick bundle (Figure 10, at right). Scholars interpreting the Zapotee panels usually identify the ball as copal incense (Masson and Orr 1998:10, Figure 1; Urcid 1992:322) or, in one case, as a pottery vessel (Marcus 1992:Fig ure 8.15); however, I would argue that the ball is rubber based on its singular number, proportions, and association with the pile of sticks, all of which relate it to codical examples. Returning to the Mixteca-Puebla codices, the rubber offering sometimes sits in a container. In Nuttall 22 the ball is supported by a rope ring (Figure 9c), similar to an Aztec sculpture of a rubber ball supported by a ring (Figure 9d). Obviously, rubber balls were stabilized in this way. There are many variations on the Standard Rubber Offering in the Mixteca-Puebla codices, occurring with more or less of the standard elements and in novel combinations. But the basic iconography of this motif seems to derive from Teotihuacan, where one sees the rubber ball with feather and bind ing (Figure 8); the stick bundle used as fuel is also present in Teotihuacan art (Taube 2000a: 10.22c), although it has not yet been found in conjunction with a rubber ball. In the art of Late Postclassic Yucatan, which absorbed substan tial influences from central Mexico, a version of the Standard Rubber Offering appears in Mural 1, Structure 12, at Tancah (Fig ure 1 la). It takes the form of a tied ball topped by a feather. Both the ball and the feather are painted blue (Miller 1982:Plate 6). The color may represent applied paint as suggested by rubber balls painted blue found in the Sacred Cenote of Chichen Itza (Coggins 1984:Number 159). The Tancah balls have cordage tied across the midsection, which is more like the Teotihuacan example (Fig ure 8), instead of running around the perimeter, which is more typical of the Mixteca-Puebla style. The ball rests on a tall mat symbol that sits on another ball, the whole assembled in an offer ing bowl. A variation of the Standard Rubber Offering, the Tancah offer ing allows one to identify analogous Postclassic Maya versions in the Madrid Codex. One version shows a Pahuatun holding a ves sel containing four rubber balls depicted as spirals, topped by a Figure 7. [a] Spiral inside a ballgame ball [detail of Borgia 42, drawn after Codex Borgia 1977]; (b) spiral in the brazier may represent a rubber ball [detail of Kaminaljuyu Stela 11, drawn after Miles 1965:Figure ISa).</page><page sequence="8">28 Stone Figure 8. The earliest known version of the Standard Rubber Offering [detail of Offering Scene Mural, Temple of Agriculture, Teotihuacan, drawn after Miller 1973:Figure 69]. mat symbol, similar to the Tancah offering, and a curious feather, consisting of a spine surrounded by dots (Figure 1 lb). The feather and rubber-ball motif link this iconography to the Standard Rub ber Offering. The fact that there are four balls may be an accurate rendering of a number specified for a ritual occasion, just as the Tancah offering has two. For instance, Landa (Tozzer 1941:142, 148) mentions offerings of two and three balls of rubber for the New Year ceremony. The Madrid rubber offering with mat symbol can be compared with two other examples, Madrid 82c and 83c (Figure 11c), in which the rubber ball, framed by cloth bands in one case, possibly alluding to the cord ties, is topped by a wispy feather. These rubber offerings also follow the formula of the Mixteca-Puebla type (i.e., feather and, in one case, a binding). At the same time, the Maya offerings have a local flavor: the use of mat symbols, the spiral symbol for the ball, and a multiplicity of balls in one instance. Further, the Maya's substitution of a spiral for the round, dark object in the codices confirms that the central Mexican ball is rubber and not copal. The stacking of feather clusters on a mat symbol as a way to mark burnt offerings has Classic Maya precedents, as seen on Piedras Negras Stelae 11 and 14 (Scheie and Miller 1986:Fig ure 2.4) and El Cayo Altar IV (Martin and Grube 2000:150). However, the use of a single feather relates the Postclassic Maya versions more closely to contemporary Mixteca-Puebla analogs than to Classic ones. The feather in one Madrid example is un usual in that it resembles a stingray spine (Figure lib). As Gab rielle Vail (personal communication, 1998) points out, the stingray spine substituting for the feather may be an allusion to blood sacrifice. A local interpretation of the Standard Rubber Offering is also seen in a mural fragment from Xcaret (Figure 1 Id). Here, the feather and mat symbol are present, but the rubber ball is replaced by a pile of yellow copal pellets. This substitution shows not only the conceptual interplay between rubber and copal, but also how the two can readily be distinguished by size, number, and color. It may seem curious that the Standard Rubber Offering ap peared as early as a.d. 250 at Teotihuacan, then reappeared in profusion in Postclassic central Mexican codices. What happened in between? The Classic Zapotee panels may show intermediate types, although they lack the feather and binding. But a more canonical version is seen in Early Classic Maya art. An Early Classic cylindrical vase set over a modeled ballgame yoke shows that the formula was transmitted to the Maya from Teotihuacan at an early date, although, again, it was locally interpreted (Fig ure 12). This lidded, black, incised cylinder, a ceramic type asso ciated with Teotihuacan influence (Scheie and Miller 1986:255, Plate 97), shows several scenes of ballplayers facing a big rubber ball. The version on the vessel body depicts the ball topped by a knot and series of quetzal feathers, elements of the Standard Rub ber Offering. It is important to note the presence of multiple feath ers. Apparently, the Classic Maya transformed the Teotihuacan single-feather motif into a series or cluster of feathers. This ex plains the presence of multiple feathers on the Piedras Negras and El Cayo examples noted earlier. Similarly, the Coztumalguapa style stela El Castillo Monument 1 (Miles 1965:Figure 18d) de picts an offering bundle as a series of feathers set over a stack of knots, a type of ritual offering that is in a distinctly Lowland Maya tradition. It is highly significant that, on the Early Classic vase, the knot and feather iconography on the ball occurs in the context of a ballgame scene in Maya art. By adding these seemingly mi nor details, the gaming ball assumes multilevel symbolism linked to both the sporting event and the complex of sacrificial burnt offerings, which the knot and feather clearly reference. The sig nificance of this will be discussed later. THE TIED RUBBER BALL The Temple of Agriculture mural presents the earliest depiction in Mesoamerica of a rubber ball tied in cordage (Figure 8). Indeed, a hallmark of the Standard Rubber Offering is that the ball is tied in some fashion. Tied rubber balls recur throughout the history of Mesoamerican art and are even portrayed in early Colonial manu scripts. Obviously, Mesoamericans attached significance to bind ing rubber balls, yet little has been said about why this may have been done. Was there a practical reason for it? Or was it strictly a symbolic gesture? To answer these questions, major examples of the motif in Mesoamerican art beyond those seen in the Standard Rubber Offering will be surveyed. Tied Rubber Balls in the Maya Area In Classic Maya art, rubber balls associated with the ballgame were occasionally shown tied. Characteristically, a rope encircles the ball, while loose rope, perhaps used to suspend the ball, some times dangles at one end. Altar 8, Tikal, presents a ball encircled by a rope, with the loose end tying a captive contained within the ball (Scheie and Miller 1986:249) (Figure 13). Copan Monument 45 shows the image of a tied ball as a three-dimensional sculpture (Figure 6). Again, the rope encircles the ball, but this time there is no loose end. The north and south markers from Ballcourt II-B, Copan, depict a ball tied in rope (Figure 14). Here the loose rope is used to suspend the ball from a crossbar. In Dresden-29c, a spiral is shown topped by a knot, an abbreviated way to represent a tied rubber ball (Figure 15). In this case, the loose end of the rope is held by Chaak. A final example can be seen in the "rubber ball sky man" discussed earlier, who is encircled by a cord with</page><page sequence="9">Spirals, ropes, and feathers 29 Figure 9.

Strangely, the extra length of rope is held in the creature's own hand, seen at the upper-right edge of the ball. The presence of this extra length of rope seems to be a trait specific to Maya versions of tied balls. The Tied Ball in Central Mexican Art Tied ballgame balls also appear in the central Mexican codices. Folio 10 of the Codex Bodley, a Postclassic Mixtee screenfold, depicts 1 Movement and 8 Deer confronting each other in a ball court (Caso 1960:38). The rubber ball is painted with a white cross, one of the conventional ways to show that it is tied (Fig ure 16a). This example and the Offering Scene Mural (Figure 8) make it clear that a circle bearing a narrow cross pattern may represent a bound rubber ball. A tied rubber ball also occurs in parallel passages in Borgia Group and Colonial screenfolds that concern the augury for Xochiquetzal as patroness of the day 1 Eagle (Seler 1963:2:228-231). Her patronage of gaming is indi cated by a patolli board and ballgame imagery, including rubber balls. The parallel scenes in the Borgia and Vaticanus B show the ballgame ball extensively bound in rope (Figure 16b-c). It might be noted that the modern Tarascans play a ballgame called pasiri a-kuri, which uses a stone ball wrapped in cloth and cordage (Sierra Carillo 1992:165). The extensive binding superficially resembles these balls. One of the sculptured friezes on the Pyramid of the Plumed Serpent at Xochicalco bears a recurring motif consisting of a toothed mouth next to a circle marked by a thin cross (Figure 17a). Given that the bindings on a rubber ball can be shown as a narrow cross pattern, it is possible, though not demonstrated conclusively, that the Xochicalco image is a tied rubber ball, an idea first suggested to me by Erik Boot (personal communication, 1999). This inter pretation seems at least as reasonable as the more usual one that the "quartered circle," as it is sometimes called, is a generic sign for a precious object. Kenneth Hirth (1989:73) invokes this argu ment and links the quartered circle to the Maya k'an cross, which conveys the meaning of "yellow" or "precious." However, a k'an cross has thick, slightly curved bars, whereas the cross on the</page><page sequence="10">30 Stone Figure 10.

Xochicalco disk is decidedly thin, closely resembling a tied rub ber ball. A rubber ball is also a type of precious object, but a specific one that has implications distinct from a generic signifier of "precious." Figure 13. Captive in a rubber ball tied by loose rope [Altar 8, Tikal, after Jones and Satterthwaite 1982:Figure 30, courtesy of the University of Pennsylvania Museum]. Related to the Xochicalco imagery is the "blood glyph com pound" (Berlo 1989:28) occurring in the Battle Scene Mural at Cacaxtla (Figure 17b). The compound consists of a circle quar tered by a thin cross pattern. This element rests over a maxilla and a bleeding-heart inset with an eye. As others have noted, the max illa and circle correspond to the mouth and circle at Xochicalco. The Cacaxtla mural shows the circle in blue, which, at first blush, would appear to discount the idea that it represents a rubber ball (see Matos 1987 for color plates). But the use of color in this instance may be symbolic rather than veristic—for instance, the gums of the jaw are also painted blue, as is a feline head worn by one of the warriors. The fact that color is used symbolically in the Cacaxtla murals—and blue seems to be the color most liberally applied—allows for the possibility that the quartered circle is a tied rubber ball. (Recall that the Tancah mural also showed the tied rubber ball in blue.) The maxilla in the blood glyph compound closely resembles a Nahuatl rebus for the locative ending -tlan, "place of," from tlantli, "teeth." Janet Berlo (1989:27-28) believes that both the Cacaxtla and Xochicalco versions of the teeth and circle glyphs are general toponymic references, given specificity by variable elements in the Xochicalco relief or the bleeding heart at Cacaxtla. It is in triguing to consider what a rubber ball might be doing as a top onym. The fact that the Gulf Coast was a rubber-producing region raises interesting possibilities, because this region has been impli cated as a source of influence at Cacaxtla (López de Molina 1980; McVicker 1985:84; Nagao 1989:93). Whether Gulf Coast or a more general eastern influence, especially Maya influence, has something to do with the enigmatic Olmeca-Xicalanca is not clear, although this argument has been proposed (McVicker 1985:98), because, among other pieces of evidence, the Olmeca-Xicalanca are linked ethnohistorically with Cacaxtla (Armillas 1946). Cer</page><page sequence="12">32 Stone Figure 14. Loose rope suspends rubber ball [North Marker, Ballcourt II-B, Copan, redrawn from drawing by B. Fash in Baudez !994:Figure 78). tainly, the name olmeca, "people of rubber," suggests an associa tion with rubber-growing regions. Karl Taube (2000b: 17) has interpreted the quartered-circle glyph as part of a title. Following Berlo, however, I would suggest that the teeth-and-circle compound is a toponym, but would diverge by speculating that the rubber ball is an additional qualifier either for a region where rubber is grown or for people associated with such a place. The rubber ball may indicate a region or a people, while the variable elements specify factions or polities within it. In this regard, it is interesting that the bleeding-heart compound at Cacaxtla occurs only with standing victors of battle, the jaguar skin-clad warriors. At Xochicalco, the glyphs are associated with a series of high-status, seated figures who seem to have distinct affiliations, as indicated by the variable element above (Berlo 1989:Figure 13). Based on the presence of a rubber ball, one could suppose that these figures have a connection with the historical olmeca, the "people of rubber," and that this eastern affiliation accounts for the strong Maya influences seen in both monuments. • This admittedly hypothetical interpretation has interesting impli cations for historical reconstructions of both Cacaxtla and Xochi calco that are too complex to consider at this time. Properties of Rubber and the Tied Rubber Ball After reviewing examples of tied rubber balls in Mesoamerican art, one is still left with the question: Why tie a rubber ball? Something about this must be significant or it would not have been portrayed in monumental sculptures, such as Copan Monu ment 45. Thinking about a possible utilitarian explanation has led me to consider the properties of rubber and the related issue of how rubber was processed, because these properties may be al tered by the mode of production. Yet the picture of rubber produc tion in ancient Mesoamerica is extremely murky. Solid rubber can be extracted from latex using a number of methods, and it is im probable that only one of these was ever adopted over the entire extent of Mesoamerica. One basic method of rubber processing is to add acidic plant juice to boiling latex, which induces coagula tion by accelerating polymer cross-linking (Baker 1998; Hosier et al. 1999). Circumstantial evidence indicates that this technique was employed in ancient Mesoamerica, perhaps utilizing different types of plants. Seeligmann et al. (1903:60) long ago claimed that Ipomea bona was used to coagulate rubber in Guatemala and Ni caragua. Fernando Sánchez Martínez (1995:82) points to the use</page><page sequence="13">Spirals, ropes, and feathers 33 Figure 15. Chaak holds on to a rubber ball, depicted as a spiral, by a long cord (Dresden 29c, redrawn after Villacorta and Villacorta 1977]. of Calonyction aculeatum and Ipomea violacea. These authors, however, do not provide supporting evidence for their claims. More recently, Hosier, Burkett, and Tarkanian (1999) identified Ipomea alba, a species of morning-glory vine, as a plant used in traditional rubber processing in Chiapas. They also noted that two early-sixteenth-century sources mention the preparation of rubber with "herbs," probably alluding to the addition of a plant, such as Ipomea alba, to the latex. The Lacandon also coagulate rubber by mixing latex with the juice of a vine that is known as camotillo in Spanish and huutikih in Lacandon (Bruce 1973:27-28). Other techniques of rubber processing are mentioned in ethno historic sources. For instance, Torquemada (1977:4:429) claimed that, if a native had no container to collect the tapped rubber, he painted it directly on his body, let it dry, peeled off the strips, and wound them into a ball. Latex could have been painted on any smooth flat surface (such as a leaf), dried, and collected. How ever, air-dried latex results in a product that is inferior to pro cessed rubber (Hosier et al. 1999:1989). Solid rubber may also have been processed by cooking latex and evaporating the excess liquid, as suggested by some Colonial evidence. A sixteenth-century Pokomchi dictionary, published by Diego Zuñiga in the seventeenth century, states that latex was cooked, and the coagulated rubber was formed into a ball (Feld man 1985:80; Lawrence Feldman, personal communication, 1999). No mention is made of a plant-juice additive, although this could have been an oversight. Cooking latex is also mentioned later (ca. 1807) by Domingo Juarros (1981) in reference to rubber produc tion in Escuintla, Guatemala. Diego Durán (cited in Stern 1949:51) mentions cooking latex with the addition of "herbs," no doubt a reference to some coagulating agent. Another widespread method of curing rubber that is still employed commercially is smoking a Figure 16. [a] Tied rubber ball in ball game scene from a Mixtec codex (de tail of Bodley 10, drawn after Caso I960]; [b] ballgame paraphernalia from the augury for the day 1 Eagle [de tail of Borgia 62, drawn after Codex Borgia 1977]; [c] ballgame parapher nalia from the augury for the day 1 Eagle (detail ofVaticanus B 67, drawn after Seler 1963:2:Figure 284]. b Figure 16.

(Semegen 1973:159). Wood smoke produces an acid that acts as a coagulating agent (Kaminitz 1988:146) and works with the drying effects of heat. Curing rubber by smoking is known among the Tupari Indians of Brazil (Kaminitz 1988:147). Indeed, the smok ing process—usually, stirring latex over a smoky fire—is so com mon that Lounsbury (1973:113) assumed that it was present in Mesoamerica when he suggested that the spiral symbol represent ing a rubber ball took its form from a rolled, smoked sheet of rubber. Yet no evidence has been found for curing rubber by smok ing in pre-Hispanic Mesoamerica. After coagulation, there are many ways rubber could have been dried. Clavigero, writing in the late eighteenth century, mentions the use of wooden molds (cited in Lowe and Ries 1944:40). Wooden molds are used today in the collection of chicle in Guatemala (Schwartz 1990:144). However, it is not known whether wooden molds were used in pre-Columbian times. Ancient Olmec rubber balls recovered from the El Manatí spring in Veracruz (Ortiz and Rodriguez 1994:Figure 5.26; Rodriguez and Ortiz 1997:88-89) were produced with windings of strips of rubber, suggesting a form of drying rubber in strips. Exposing the maximum surface of rubber to air, which thin strips accomplish, increases polymeriza tion of the molecules, strengthening the fabric of the material</page><page sequence="14">34 Stone Figure 17. [a] Relief showing glyph compound with mouth and tied rubber ball; variable element is above (detail of Xochicalco, Pyramid of the Plumed Serpent, redrawn after Hirth l989:Figure 4]; [b] blood-glyph compound composed of tied rubber ball, maxilla, and bleeding heart [detail of Cacaxtla Battle Scene Mural, drawn after Matos 1987:71). (Todd Cornell, personal communication, 1999). Further, a ball produced from a wound string is more resilient than a solid-core ball—take, for example, the golf ball and many other types of solid sporting balls (Tudor 1947). The Olmec may have been aware of these properties of rubber. I can now turn to the question of the tied rubber ball and consider whether any of the properties of rubber would have warranted this tying. In approaching this issue, one must also consider the thermoplastic properties of natural rubber: soft and tacky when hot and stiff and brittle when cold (Allington 1988:125). Given the climate of Mesoamerica, the sticky surface of rubber would have been the problem. Adding particles to the surface of rubber—carbon particles from smoking, if such a method of curing were employed, or dusting rubber with dirt— could have decreased the tackiness (Barbara Gedeon, personal communication, 1999). Mary Baker (personal communication, 1999), formerly of the Smithsonian Center for Materials Re search and Education, believes she may have evidence of the latter. She examined rubber samples from a native context in which guayule rubber was used, although it was unclear whether the samples came from the American Southwest or northern Mex ico. The samples revealed a high iron content, possibly evidence that the rubber had been rolled in dirt. The dirt would have made the rubber more durable, according to Baker, because iron helps cure rubber. Theoretically, the dirt also could have made the rubber less tacky. This may have interfered with rubber's usually excellent ability to self-adhere, so that a ball produced from a wound strip might have come unwound. Tying the ball could have been one way to prevent strips from unraveling. According to Leyenaar (1978:61, Figure 57), rubber balls used in a modern version of the ballgame played in western Mexico are kept in wooden molds to keep them round. Perhaps following from this idea, Linda Scheie and Peter Mathews (1998:152) sug gest that the Classic Maya tied gaming balls to maintain their round shape. But this seems unlikely, as a rope lashed around a ball could hardly do much to maintain its shape. That rope was used to maintain the shape of the ball due to sagging in warm temperatures also seems unlikely. The heat needed to make a solid rubber object sag seems well beyond the ambient temperatures of even the Mesoamerican tropics. Gedeon (personal communica tion, 1999) conducted an experiment in which she heated a block of natural rubber. At 125°F, the block did not deform; it finally began to melt at 250°F. In an experiment conducted by Hosier, Burkett, and Tarkanian (1999:1989), rubber was heated to 200°C (392°F) for one hour to make it pliable enough to mold easily by hand. These temperatures are well beyond those to which rubber would have been exposed in ordinary circumstances. Moreover, if the rubber were being softened by the action of heat, the constric tion of a rope would probably deform it precisely in the spots where the rope tightened around the ball. Additional experimen tation with natural rubber would be useful in testing some of these ideas. If there were practical reasons to tie rubber balls, one may have been to deal with their tacky surface and property of self adherence. Binding rubber balls may have kept them from touch ing other objects to which they would stick or to keep particles from impregnating their surface. The tribute list for Tochtepec from the Codex Mendoza pictures the rubber balls encircled in a gray band (Berdan and Anawalt 1992:3:Folio 46r). This looks again like some kind of binding or wrapping. Shipping large quan tities of rubber balls to Tenochtitlan would seem to have necessi tated some method of keeping the balls from touching one another, because rubber readily sticks to itself. Tying may have also pro vided a convenient way to handle heavy, sticky rubber balls, given that a mere seven-inch-wide solid ball weighed eight pounds (Stern 1949:80). The rope around the Vaticanus B ball is looped at the top, as though to provide a carrying handle (Figure 16c). In the case of a rubber ball used as a burnt offering, the binding may have been left on as an ignition material, similar to how rubber was used to ignite copal. Spiritual Pollution and Suspension The tying of a rubber ball may have had ritual or symbolic signif icance in addition to a practical function. The presence of a cord around the ball may have signaled a symbolic relationship to the</page><page sequence="15">Spirals, ropes, and feathers 35 complex of sacrificial offerings. Even a ball used as sporting equip ment, shown with bindings, could assume those connotations. This is certainly suggested by the Early Classic vase that depicts a gaming ball exhibiting features of the Standard Rubber Offering (Figure 12). The presence of a captive in a tied ball on Tikal Altar 8 (Figure 13) conveys the notion of the ball as a sacrificial (in this case, human) offering. The rope suspending the balls on the Co pan ballcourt markers have attached bone motifs and composite jewels that designate precious items that were ritually sacrificed (Figure 14). This evidence suggests that the ballgame ball was conceived on one level as a precious sacrificial offering to the gods. Given rubber's substitution for blood, the ball was also, on another level, a blood offering and could be equated with a human sacrifice, which in Maya art would sometimes appear inside the ball. In the Borgia Codex, a nude, bound captive is marked as a precious sacrifice by the rubber offering on his head, as though the two are equivalent (Figure 18). This interpretation also explains the imagery of Copan Monument 45, which is steeped in refer ences to the sacrificial-offering complex (Figure 6). The channel on top was used as a conduit for blood offerings, while the rope and spiral marked the ball as a precious burnt rubber offering, even though the ball simultaneously alluded to the ballgame. Granted, some of these symbols, such as the rope, could have evoked different levels of meaning. Looking at this another way, David Stuart (1996:157) avers that binding metaphorically al luded to containing a thing's divine essence; thus, the rope could be holding in the sacred essence of the blood/rubber that it encir cles while simultaneously marking its status as a precious offering. The Maya evidence suggests that suspending or carrying an object by a rope was a way to handle special objects, perhaps objects that were intended as sacrificial offerings. This is sug gested by the image of Chaak suspending a rubber ball by a cord Figure 18. Human sacrifice marked with rubber offering (detail of Borgia 4, drawn after Codex Borgia 1977]. in the Dresden Codex (Figure 15). The scene takes place in a cenote, at the bottom of which is a type of ritual offering that appears frequently in the Dresden: an iguana tamale (huh wah). Given this context, the suspended ball appears to represent an other ritual offering, but one held in a distinctive manner. This recalls a painted Late Classic vase that depicts hunters decked out in fantastic garb and body paint (Kerr 1989:74). Several hold dead prey or severed pieces thereof. In one case, a hunter holds a bound peccary haunch by a rope handle, recalling the rope handle of the Vaticanus B ball (Figure 19a). Another hunter proffers a tied deer haunch by a carrying cord (Figure 19b). Is suspension by a cord merely a convenient way to hold something, or does it have greater significance? In fact, the holding of tied objects by long cords occurs sporadically in Maya art, often with strange objects being held (Robicsek and Hales 1981:Figure 32, central monkey fig ure). A stucco fagade from Tonina depicts a rodent (possibly a rat) suspending a circular object by a long cord (see Coe and Kerr 1998:119 for a color plate). The circle, emblazoned with a head, is bound around the perimeter in a way that recalls tied rubber balls. The head is a personified ba glyph (T501). This specific glyph frequently appears inside gaming balls, though usually with a na (T23) superfix, spelling nab, and a numerical prefix (Scheie and Miller 1986:252). At Tonina, the na may be indicated by the flar ing rim above the circle, which resembles the T4 version of na. A circumstantial case can therefore be made that the rodent in the Tonina relief is holding a rubber ball by a long cord—perhaps a ball intended for ritual sacrifice I suggest that only items of special status were held by suspen sion, perhaps items that were not to be touched because they could be polluted or could endanger the holder. Allen Christenson (per sonal communication, 1999) has pointed out an ethnographic par allel. The Tzutujil of Santiago Atitlán collect prized flowers from the coast and bring them back for display in cult houses. These flowers are usually hung from the rafters to keep them free from contact with anything profane, thereby avoiding ritual pollution. This recalls the Copan Ballcourt marker that shows a ball sus pended from the rafters (Figure 14). Carrying a rubber ball or any object by a long rope may signify that it has special status as an offering. It would also allow the holder to avoid touching the ball, which could have served both ritual and practical ends. CONCLUSIONS As Europeans quickly recognized, and Mesoamericans had known for millennia, natural rubber is a remarkable material with a wide range of uses. However, rubber iconography in Mesoamerican art is narrowly focused. Although rubber is occasionally shown as body decoration, two other roles receive the greatest attention: rubber as ballgame equipment and rubber as a burnt ritual offer ing. This paper has shown that, by manipulating details of rubber ball iconography—for instance, by including feathers, ropes, and spirals—these two symbolic domains could be superimposed. In this view, the gaming ball partook of the symbolism of the offer ing complex and could stand for a precious sacrifice to the gods. On a higher symbolic level, the ball was a substitute for a human sacrifice. This explains why bound humans, intended for sacrifice, are seen inside the ball. The tackiness of rubber may have made it difficult to handle, and overcoming this may have been the original inspiration for the tying of rubber balls, seen earliest at Teotihuacan. However, the image of a tied ball also seems to be related to the binding of</page><page sequence="16">36 Stone Figure 19.

This would be expected, because binding and knots are redolent with meaning in Mesoamerican iconography. The carrying of tied balls by suspension cords in the Maya area may have been a strategy to avoid contact with them owing to their tacky surface and high ritual status. Because the representation of a rubber ball as a dark circular object may have seemed ripe for confusion, and even color would be lacking in stone sculp ture. Mesoamericans devised other visual solutions, such as the spiral form, probably derived from rolling balls in strips, as Lounsbury first proposed and archeaological examples of which are known from El Manatí and Chichen Itza. The presence of cordage and feathers on balls may have served further to disam biguate the iconography, while the quetzal feather on balls re inforced their status as precious objects worthy of sacrifice. Mesoamericans took a remarkable material, natural rubber, and transformed it not just for mundane purposes, as Europeans did after decades of experimentation, but also for the enrichment of their religious life. RESUMEN El hule tenía usos utilitarios, simbólicos, y rituales importantes en la antigua Mesoamérica. Entre ellos se encuentra el uso de pelotas de hule como ofrendas para ser quemadas en sacrificios rituales. Este estudio ex amina manifestaciones iconográficas de ofrendas de pelotas de hule en el arte de Mesoamérica. Las representaciones de pelotas de hule han sido con frecuencia, identificadas erróneamente, por ejemplo, como copal. Sin em bargo, el arte de Mesoamérica representa pelotas de hule según convenci ones artísticas específicas. En los códices mayas postclásicos toman la forma de un espiral negro. Se propone que los mayas clásicos también utilizaron este simbolismo y hay evidencia que sugeriere su uso en otras partes de Mesoamérica. Ofrendas de pelotas de hule se encuentran en agrupaciones de elementos iconográficos típicos que he llamado la Ofrenda de Hule Convencional. Este motivo, muy común en el arte de Mesoamérica, vincula las ofrendas de pelotas de hule con plumas de aves y ligaduras de soga. El primer ejemplo conocido de la Ofrenda de Hule Convencional aparece en Teotihuacan en el Mural de las Ofrendas en el Templo de la Agricultura, ca. 250 d.C. Un ejemplo en un vaso maya clásico temprano revela que los mayas tomaron prestado este tipo de imágenes con el fin de identificar la pelota usada en el juego como una ofrenda de sacrificio. La Ofrenda de Hule Convencional es* el más prolífico en los códices postclásicos del estilo Mixteca-Puebla, pero se pueden identificar ejemplos de este tipo en los códices mayas y murales posclásicos de Quintana Roo. Cada zona presenta sus propias varia ciones. Este estudio también considera la pregunta de porqué en el arte</page><page sequence="17">Spirals, ropes, and feathers 37 de Mesoamérica las pelotas de hule se muestran repetidamente atadas con soga. A propósito se propone una nueva identificación de la pelota de hule atada en el arte de Xochicalco y Cacaxtla. Posibles razones para atar las pelotas de hule podrían estar relacionadas con las propiedades físicas del hule natural. Se sugiere que la pegajosidad del hule en las temperaturas calurosas fue la motivación para envolver las pelotas de hule en soga. La presencia de ligaduras de soga en las pelotas asociadas con el juego apoya la noción que la pelota de hule deportiva fue consid erada al mismo tiempo como una ofrenda de sacrificio ritual relacionada con la sangre. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This paper was written while I was a Fellow at Dumbarton Oaks and would not have been possible without the use of that organization's ex cellent library and the time to ponder these intricate issues. I especially thank Bridget Gazzo for attending to my every book need. I also thank Mary Baker, Harriet Beaubien, Justin Kerr, and Javier Urcid, who did those small favors that have a huge impact on one's work. Natanya Blanck kindly corrected the Spanish summary. Above all, I am grateful to Barbara Gedeon, manager of the plastics testing division of the Akron Rubber Development Laboratory, who not only generously shared her opinions on technical issues and the results of her experi ments but also provided helpful literature and samples of natural latex and rubber.
