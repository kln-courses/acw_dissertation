<plain_text><page sequence="1">Thoreau Society Bulletin, Number 276, Fall 2011 The Village of Brute Neighbors: Teaching Environmental Irony in Walden Robert Klevay William Cronon's essay, "The Trouble with Wilderness," encourages its readers to appreciate a mundane "wildness" over the desire to be overwhelmed by a sublime "wilderness." Cronon writes that "wildness (as opposed to wilderness) can be found anywhere: in the seemingly tame fields and woodlots of Massachusetts, in the cracks of a Manhattan sidewalk, even in the cells of our own bodies.'" Cronon's definition of "wildness" acknowledges that humanity is an essential part of nature and ironically suggests that even an urban environment can offer natural insights. In Walden, Henry David Thoreau similarly offers praise for a "wildness" that does not exclude human beings or suggest a quest for a "pure" nature. He believes that the "tonic of wildness" can be found in "the seacoast with its wrecks," but also in the "tortoises and toads run over in the road."2 Students expecting to find a simple prophet living by the side of a pristine pond are often disappointed by the book's ironic rhetorician, who declares he is "naturally no hermit," and who suggests that "the hunter is the greatest friend of the animals hunted, not excepting the Humane Society."3 Thoreau's determination to encourage human interaction with nature while at the same time preserving it as a place beyond humanity's limitations can be frustrating to those reading the book for the first time. By examining Thoreau's portrait of Concord in "The Village," one can assist students in exploring the questions that Thoreau's seemingly ambivalent position raises. The narrator's facetious portrayal of the villagers' everyday tasks as sublime allows him to reveal the potential "wildness" lurking within normal life. By beginning with Thoreau's treatment of human beings in "The Village," students in an American literature survey can come to appreciate not only Thoreau's more domestic "wild" in "Brute Neighbors," but also to see Thoreau's narrator as a balanced critic of humanity instead of a judge biased on nature's behalf. Thoreau begins "The Village" with a tone that can often strike first time readers as judgmental. Thoreau appears to draw a clear distinction between his own more "natural" way of life and that of Concord's inhabitants. He declares that he only goes into the village "Every day or two" to immunize himself against the harmful gossip that the villagers treat as their purpose in life.4 In response, students often wonder why Thoreau feels the need to visit Concord at all if he finds the gossip so harmful. Unexpectedly, Thoreau chooses a natural comparison to mock what he initially casts as an unnatural activity. He compares the gossip of the townsfolk to the sounds of a soothing evening when he writes that their talk is "really as refreshing in its way as the rustle of leaves and the peeping of frogs."5 Thoreau then remarks that the villagers are just as interesting as the supposedly more "wild" creatures that he observes: As I walked in the woods to see the birds and squirrels, so I walked in the village to see the men and boys; instead of the wind among the pines I heard the carts rattle. In one direction from my house there was a colony of muskrats in the river meadows; under the grove of elms and buttonwoods in the other horizon was a busy village of men, as curious to me as if they had been prairie dogs, each sitting at the mouth of its burrow, or running over to a neighbor's to gossip. I went there frequently to observe their habits.6 Thoreau's description of the Concordians does not diminish them, but renders their frivolous conversation as enthralling as the trees, muskrats, and prairie dogs that usually attract his interest.7 The gossip may seem unnatural to any other creature on Earth, but it is part of how humanity makes its way in the world. This fits with Thoreau's fascination with everyday human creativity, as is evident through his interest in the eighteenth century account book of Deacon Reuben Brown and the several journal entries devoted to retracing the construction of Edmund Hosmer's seventeenth-century farmhouse.8 Although Thoreau satirizes those living in "quiet desperation," whom he believes seek a false comfort in triviality, this is not the same as feeling contempt for them.9 He implies that the villagers have a misdirected wildness within them. Even if it is frustrated and distorted, this wildness connects them to nature. While Thoreau is clearly uncomfortable with his neighbors' single minded pursuit of trivial information, it can be a revelation to students that he is also fascinated by their misdirected attention. He wonderingly describes how the village is efficiently laid out like a "gantlet" to make sure that "every man, woman, and child might get a lick" at a visiting stranger via a gossipy chat, a possible sale, lingering meal, or other oppressive expression of hospitality.10 Thoreau even appreciates the animal-like desire for escape that the pushy villagers inspire in him. For him, a dinner invitation often creates a fight-or-flight response: "Sometimes I bolted suddenly, and nobody could tell my whereabouts, for I did not stand much about gracefulness, and never hesitated at a gap in a fence.'"1 Discussing Thoreau's wary, yet admiring tone with students can help them not only to appreciate the chapter's satire, but also alert them to later ironies. Reading "The Village" prepares students for Thoreau's reversal of its pattern in "Brute Neighbors." If earlier he makes the ordinary villagers into perversely suffocating animals to contrast with his desire for solitude, in/'Brute Neighbors" he carefully domesticates wild animals to suggest their closeness to humanity even as he concedes their actual estrangement. Through an approving reference to a writer of ancient Sanskrit fables, Thoreau announces his wish to explore the human tendency to project our own interpretative frameworks onto nature. He declares "Pilpay &amp; Co."—Pilpay being a fable writer similar to Aesop or Jean de La Fontaine—to "have put animals to their best use, for they are all beasts of burden, in a sense, made to carry some portion of our thoughts.'"2 Thoreau emphasizes how even the most familiar animals still maintain a sliver of a wilder nature, which recalls his earlier comparison of the townspeople to prairie dogs. He describes a dog who likes to chase foxes, woodchucks, and squirrels in the woods "without the knowledge of his master.'"3 He expresses the belief that "the most domestic cat, which has lain on a rug all her days, appears quite at home in the woods, and, by her sly and stealthy behavior, proves herself more native there than the regular inhabitants.'"4 Thoreau's most memorable anecdotes render his "wild" animal neighbors in an anthropomorphic fashion. He describes a friendship that he develops with a mouse living in his cabin. He mentions that although the animal had "never seen a man before," that it "soon became quite familiar" with him.15 Eventually, he is able to play with the mouse as if it were a rambunctious village child on a visit. He writes that, At length, as I leaned with my elbow on the bench one day, it</page><page sequence="2">Thoreau Society Bulletin, Number 276, Fall 2011 ran up my clothes, and along my sleeve, and round and round the paper which held my dinner while I kept the latter close, and dodged and played at bo-peep with it; and when at last I held still a piece of cheese between my thumb and finger, it came and nibbled it, sitting in my hand, and afterward cleaned its face and paws, like a fly, and walked away.16 Thoreau is amazed by "how many creatures live wild and free though secret in the woods, and still sustain themselves in the neighborhood of towns."17 Wildness is not as distant as student readers might imagine that it is. He also notes, "You only need sit still long enough in some attractive spot in the woods that all its inhabitants may exhibit themselves to you by turns."18 Here, students often overlook how Thoreau cleverly reverses the paradigm from "The Village": instead of the villagers suffocating a newcomer whom they turn "wild," the "Brute Neighbors" happily remain the center of the stranger's domesticating gaze. The passage where Thoreau surveys an ant battle on his woodpile, while less peaceful, is ultimately no less domesticated. Thoreau comfortably compares the ants' war to American history by remarking that they must be fighting for some principle greater than avoiding "a three penny tax on their tea.'"9 He also incorporates the ant warriors to the Western literary canon by naming one lingering ant a Homeric "Achilles, who had nourished his wrath apart, and had now come to avenge or rescue his Patroclus."20 Only when describing the loon at the end of the chapter does Thoreau pierce the domesticating veil that he has draped over his wild neighbors. He begins by comparing the loon's evasiveness to a human opponent at a homely board game, as he writes: "Suddenly your adversary's checker disappears beneath the board, and the problem is to place yours nearest to where his will appear again."21 However, his ultimate failure to catch the "silly," but also wildly "demoniac" bird convinces him of the limits to his interpretive abilities.22 Even so, the loon never entirely loses the characteristics of a human opponent, as Thoreau concludes, "he laughed in derision of my effort."23 Thoreau's puncturing of his own domesticated perspective on nature serves as a reminder that he—as well as his potential readers—imposes such a perspective on nature simply by seeing it. Students in an American survey course will realize that just like the narrator at the end of Stephen Crane's "The Open Boat," Thoreau knows that the innate feeling one can be an "interpreter" of nature is not the same thing as actual understanding.24 Through comparing how Thoreau renders his human neighbors more "wild" in "The Village" and makes his animal neighbors more domestic in "Brute Neighbors," students in an American survey course can become more receptive to Thoreau's ironic voice. Students are often reluctant to accept Thoreau's writing because they are challenged by his irony, which can cause them to find him confusing at best and arrogant at worst. However, the contrasting patterns in these two chapters reveal that Thoreau is not always charitable towards nature and critical of humanity. Like William Cronon, Thoreau wants his readers to celebrate the "wildness in our own backyards" and the nature found in "the place[s] where we actually live" rather than wishing human influence away.25 From Thoreau's perspective, which he acknowledges is only his own, gossiping human beings are as much a part of nature as friendly mice or war-like ants.
