<plain_text><page sequence="1">Scientists Decry a Slick New Packaging of Creationism edited by William J. Bennetta Evidence that supports evolution is found in biochemistry, genetics, paleontology, and physical anthropology. Nine noted scientists give teachers their views. Creationism is a fundamentalist political movement with political aspirations that are broad, bold, and almost universally underesti mated by the public and the press. The creationists want to bring all science education and all science under religious control. Ulti mately, they want to replace science with a system of pseudo science devoted to confirming biblical narratives. In seeking those goals, the creationists strive to undermine the public's understanding of science's precepts, methods, and findings. Their most visible efforts are aimed at crippling science education in public schools and especially at causing schools to teach pseudoscience that distorts various topics in physics, chemistry, astronomy, geology, paleontology, and biology. (This is the issue in the Louisiana "creation-science" case, which is before the Supreme Court.) Creationism was bolstered last autumn by the so-called American Scientific Affiliation (ASA), which actually is a religious group. Its members must affirm that the Bible is the inspired, unerring word of God. Last year, the ASA produced (and in 1987 revised) a 48-page booklet, Teaching Science in a Climate of Controversy, and started sending copies to biology teachers throughout the country. The booklet has two major themes: • Explicitly: Teachers should use special "guidelines" when they conduct classes about evolution or "origins" (which in creationist writings denotes entire histories—of the universe, of Earth, and of life). The guidelines suggest bringing material from the Bible into classroom discussions and comparing scientific inferences to popular beliefs. • Implicitly: Among beliefs about the "origins" of living things, the one based on biblical literalism is the right one. Scientific inferences about the history of life—inferences about evolution—are flimsy and suspect, because the fossil record has a lot of gaps. The ASA's rejection of evolutionary biology rests squarely on the popular notion that fossils are the major (or the only) evidence of evolutionary relation ships. That notion is wrong, and it never has been right; it is a folktale, but the ASA writers affirm it and build several assertions around it: • Scientists cannot reasonably infer "where" animals came from, because the fossil record is sparse until the Cambrian period. • Scientists cannot make valid inferences about the histories of living species, William ]. Bennetta, who solicited these essays, is a consulting biologist and a professional editor and writer. His work includes Crusade of the Credulous (California Academy of Sciences Press, 1986), a group of essays about creationism and its effects on public education. 36 The Science Teacher/May 1987</page><page sequence="2">because biochemical and morphological homologies don't matter unless they are certified by fossils. • Without a continuous procession of fossils, scientists cannot infer that humans and the great apes share an ancestor. All the anatomical, biochemical, and behavioral similarities between humans and apes may be attributable to "convergence." In many ways, the ASA work is an ordinary exercise in creationist pseudo science. It deserves special attention, however, because it has been distributed widely and because it may seem respectable to laypeople. The writers offer "science" that is thoroughly false but often plausible. They bolster this material with out-of-context quotations from legitimate publications and even with pictures of real scientists. And to borrow some initial credibility, they reject the idea—easily refuted but still popular among many creationists—that the Earth is only a few thousand years old. The 1986 booklet was examined by a number of prominent scientists in the pertinent disciplines, including biology, paleontology, and anthropology. In the short essays that follow, nine scientists analyze various aspects of the booklet and the creationism that it promotes. Their analyses will help teachers and curriculum specialists to understand creationism and to respond to parents or school officials who may have been misled by the ASA's work. Collectively, these essays affirm a principle that sometimes is overlooked: Science teachers are not mere observers or translators of the scientific enter prise; they are important participants in it—guardians of its future health and success and colleagues with the professional scientists who work in universities and other research centers. When science education comes under attack, teachers can expect their colleagues to help in defending it. □ Douglas J. Futuyma Douglas ]. Futuyma, author of the textbook Evolutionary Biology (Sinauer Associates, 1986), is the current president of the Society for the Study of Evolution. His research concentrates on the evolution of feeding habits in herbivorous insects. He is a professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolution, State University of New Yorlc, Stony Brook, NY 11794. The ASA has issued a creation ist tract that uses as its princi pal tactics innuendo and selec tive omission. The latter is especially serious because the writers create an impression of evenhandedness where none exists. As an illustration of innuendo, con sider their section "Correcting Past Mistakes," which invokes two notori ous cases. One was the Piltdown man hoax, in which some scientists were fooled into constructing a prehistoric "human" from some false fossils (a piece of an ape's jaw, some ape teeth, and parts of a human skull) that had been planted in a gravel pit near Pilt down, England. The second was the Paluxy "man tracks" case, in which some creation ists convinced themselves (but no scientists) that fossil tracks of humans and of dinosaurs lay together near the Paluxy River in Texas. This, the ere ationists said, meant that humans and dinosaurs had lived side by side and that scientists were wrong about the history of Earth and of life. (Examina tion of the tracks has shown that all are dinosaurian; none is human.) The message is that the scientists (fooled by the Piltdown hoaxer) and the creationists (misinterpreting the Paluxy tracks) may be equated: They are equally susceptible to error, but equally capable of correcting it. The writers give no hint of the innumerable scientific discoveries and interpreta tions that have withstood the test of time. Neither do they mention the com plete absence of evidence for special creation. Nor do they mention the creationists' unquestioning commit ment to beliefs that must exclude bio logical evolution, no matter what the evidence says. This brings us to selective omission. When scientists say that evolution is a fact, they mean that all organisms have descended, with change, from common ancestors. They do not merely mean (as the ASA writers suggest) that "the fossil record shows a succession of increasingly complex life forms." Evi dence of evolution comes from many sources, and the fossil record is only one of these; moreover, evolution is not restricted to increasing complexity. Almost all of evolutionary biology is concerned with the history and mechanisms of change. But from a great, diverse literature, the ASA writers pick only two topics. One is the notorious problem of the origin of the invertebrate phyla; for good geo logical reasons, this is perhaps the area of greatest paleontological ignorance. The other topic is the fossil record of human evolution, which the authors depict as utterly inadequate and con fusing. They do not point out that the record, sparse though it may be, beau tifully confirms the prediction that bipedality and other human features have increased over time. They imply that we must doubt the overall pat tern unless we have evidence for every tiny step in our evolutionary history. They do not, however, say what evi dence they might demand from a creationist. And what of the rest of the evi dence for evolution? Do we find in the ASA booklet any description of the fossil sequences that document the evolution of reptiles from amphibians, of angiosperms from gymnosperms, or of ammonites from bactritids? No. Do we find examples of intermediate The Science Teacher/May 1987 37</page><page sequence="3">forms, such as the ancestors of ants, that were predicted and then were found in the fossil record? No. Do we find discussions of any nonpaleontolo gical evidence for evolution—evidence from biogeography or genetics or com parative anatomy or embryology? No. Nor do we find any hint that evolu tionary relationships deduced from morphological similarities are being confirmed abundantly by similarities in the nonfunctional sequences in DNA— as independent a source of evidence as one could hope for. My book Science on Trial: The Case for Evolution (Pantheon, 1983) surveyed the major lines of evidence that, a century ago, convinced the scientific world of the reality of evolution. All those lines have been greatly expanded and strengthened since then; but all are completely absent from the ASA book let. Read past the veneer of sweet reasonableness, and bear in mind what the writers themselves declare in italics: "In science, all relevant information, including lack of evidence, must be taken into considera tion when drawing conclusions." □ Maxine F. Singer Maxine F. Singer's research focuses on the organization of information in mammalian DNA. She chairs the editorial board of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and she is working on a textbook of molecular genetics. She currently is chief of the Laboratory of Biochemistry, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892. Both classical genetics and molecu lar genetics have provided broad, independent support for Darwinian explanations of biological evolution. The idea of natural selec tion depended in part on organisms' having variable properties, but Darwin did not know the source of the variabil ity. The discovery of genes, of their mutability, and of the rules of hered ity has shown us the substrate upon which natural selection acts. This joining of genetics to evolu tionary thinking is neither obscure nor new. It arose a half-century ago, and it now stands at the center of all biol ogy. By ignoring it, the writers of the ASA booklet have made a mockery of their claims of objectivity. Genetics became a molecular science more than 30 years ago, when we learned that genes are DNA and learned about DNA's structure. Struc tural comparisons of homologous genes and gene products (RNAs and proteins) from different organisms are now routine elements of molecular biology. Each such comparison—and they are available by the dozen—provides in dependent evidence that all extant organisms share a common ancestor. For example, the histone proteins that help to fold DNA into chromosomes have strikingly similar structures in organisms as different as yeasts and mammals. The same is true of genes that encode the enzyme RNA poly merase, which governs the synthesis of RNA. Equally impressive is the fact that certain short sequences of bases recur in DNAs that encode quite different proteins in quite different organisms. Each such sequence encodes a poly peptide region that performs a charac teristic function, even in proteins that are more or less disparate. To dismiss as mere coincidence this powerful evidence of common ancestry is to offend both knowledge and reason. Genes and gene products in differ ent organisms are not just similar in structure. When genes are transferred between organisms, they function normally in their new environments. They direct the synthesis of their cor responding proteins, and the proteins impart the corresponding features to the recipient organism. Recall the pic tures, published a few years ago in many newspapers, of mice that had grown extraordinarily large because they had been equipped with growth hormone genes from a human. Another human gene, inserted into yeast cells, offsets a yeast mutation that ordinarily is lethal. There are two possible explanations for the omission of genetics from the ASA document. Either its authors are more than 50 years behind today's —Dan Singer science, or they have deliberately avoided telling about the most com pelling evidence for evolution by genet ic variation and natural selection. □ Michael T. Ghiselin Michael T. Ghiselin's scholarship embraces invertebrate zoology, evolutionary biology, and the history of science.

He is currently a senior research fel low, California Academy of Sciences, San Francisco, CA 94178. Creationists frequently apply double standards in what they purport to be respectable dis course. They apply a selective skepti cism to some of science, but not a general skepticism to all of science. To ciaim that evolution is "just a theory," as creationists often do, is false and deceptive unless the audience under stands that digestion and the circula tion of the blood have precisely the same status in science: the status of theory. The ASA pamphleteers, in their attempt to disparage unwelcome scien 38 The Science Teacher/May 1987</page><page sequence="4">tific findings, use arguments based on a logical fallacy. They belabor the lack of evidence for some particular propo sition about evolution, as if this some how affected the positive evidence for other propositions—including the gen eral proposition that evolution has occurred. Their strategy depends on mislead ing discussions of the fossil record, though that record is not, and never has been, the most compelling evidence for evolution. What convinced Darwin and his contemporaries was not the fossil record but biogeography: The geographical distribution of organisms is inexplicable unless the various groups have arisen through descent with modification. The general proposition that Earth's organisms are parts of a genealogical nexus of ancestors and descendants is as well established as any other find ing of natural science. Denying it is like denying that our blood circulates in our bodies. And even if we are not sure about the identity of our closest relatives, we have overwhelming evi dence that we share ancestors with the apes. The evidence becomes more than overwhelming if we try to find scientific reasons for denying that Homo sapiens is a primate, a mammal, a ver tebrate, and a metazoan. There are none. The ASA pamphleteers preach tem perate discourse but they practice innuendo. They claim, for example, that evolutionary biologists attribute things to "chance." Well, mutations are —5m*im MiMrion indeed fortuitous, so there is a sense in which chance plays a role in evolu tion. But biologists certainly do not treat chance in the way that our pamphleteers imply—as if it were some agent that causes things to change. If this "chance" does not account for organic form or variation, the pam phleteers ask, what does? They do not tell their answer plainly but they repeatedly imply it: divine design. To this they offer only one alternative, and their offering is bogus. They note that similarities among organisms may suggest common ancestry when in fact they are due to convergence. But they do not tell how easy it is for anybody who knows a little comparative anato my to perceive the difference. A responsible parent or teacher would no more teach bad logic than bad grammar, bad spelling, or bad morals. In science, right conduct con sists of evaluating evidence honestly and according to the canons of scien tific reasoning. To misrepresent the evidence and the criteria of judgment is not merely to provide misinforma tion; it is to set an example of dis honesty. Telling lies to naive and trusting young persons is bad. Doing so for the purpose of proselytizing is worse. □ Niles Eldredge Niles Eldredge, a specialist in invertebrate paleontology, studies relations between evolu tionary principles and events in the history of life. His book The Monkey Business (Pocket Books, 1982) is one of the best-known analyses of creationism and creationist pseudo science. He is the curator of invertebrate paleon tology, American Museum of Natural His tory, New York, NY 10024. The ASA booklet appears to seek a middle ground between the hard-boiled "scientific creation ists" and the defenders of cosmic, stel lar, and biological evolution—which is to say, scientists. Let's talk this over calmly, the ASA writers say; let's admit that nothing in science is final; and let's admit that some claims of "scien tific creationism" cannot be taken —American Museum of Natural History seriously as descriptions of the mate rial universe. In the end, however, they retreat to the central canon of all creationism—that the major groups of organisms may have been separately created. As do most creationists nowa days, they allow that minor, "micro evolutionary" changes through natural selection are possible; but the grand differences may well reflect the spe cial acts of a Creator. The writers ignore a fundamental fact of biology: There is a pattern of similarity linking absolutely nil forms of life to one another. For example, all the canids—the family that includes wolves, coyotes, foxes, wild dogs, and domestic dogs—resemble one another so closely that even creationists will generally concede that they are related and that the differences among them may represent evolutionary variation. But the canids clearly share an im pressive array of features with certain other families, such as the bears, the cats, and the weasels. Just as clearly, all these families are mammals. And just as clearly, all mammals share with birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fishes a basic anatomical arrangement that unites them all as vertebrates. If we are to explain the similarities among canids as evidence of related ness and common ancestry, why should we stop there? Would it not be logically consistent to explain all pat terns of similarity as the effects of one grand cause—descent with modifica tion from a common ancestor? But creationists will have none of this. Ignoring the pattern of similarity that links all life, they arbitrarily declare that evolution may have proceeded within certain groups of organisms but The Science Teacher/May 1987 39</page><page sequence="5">not between such groups—no matter how many similarities the groups may share with one another. Each group, they say, arose by special creation. The absurdity of the creationists' position is shown well in the ASA booklet, and especially in its treatment of our own species. The writers belit tle the striking biochemical similarities between humans and apes, and they insist that only fossils could show that humans and apes share an ancestor. Then they say that we have no perti nent fossils: "Current biochemical studies of the DNA 'molecular clock' indicate that the supposed common ancestor [of humans and apes] would have lived 5 to 8 million years ago. At present we have no fossil hominoids of any kind from that particular period." How ironic! The molecular clock information that they invoke is based on the very biochemical evidence that they have belittled and dismissed. That evidence includes the finding that the correspondence between human DNA and chimpanzee DNA is more than 98 percent. And it says that our spe cies is one of the worst examples that could be picked in an effort to support the doctrine of special creation and to deny the universality of evolution. □ Lynn Margulis Lynn Margulis's current research includes studies of the symbiotic origin of cell organelles and studies of living microbial mats as analogs of ancient microbial communities. Boston University has recognized her scientific achievements by awarding her the title University Professor of Biology, Boston University, Boston, MA 02215. The ASA document is insidious. Who can disagree when the writers admonish us to "teach with openness while upholding stan dards of scientific integrity"? Or when they tell us that "science teachers uphold the standards of scientific in tegrity by showing students how to arrive at conclusions based on valid evidence"? Or when they declare that "teachers share with scientists a respon sibility for public education about science"? We agree, of course, and so we may be fooled by this masterful piece of propaganda. The text conveys an ex pansive mood of tolerance and makes some genuinely tentative, scientific assertions. The diagrams are accurate, the layout and printing are admirable, and the writers have reserved until page 46 their muted, inconspicuous statement of the religious beliefs to which members of the ASA must — BiKton University Photo Srrvkr subscribe—belief in the Bible, in Jesus Christ, and in God as the creator and sustainer of the physical universe. The result is treacherous. Authen tic scientific and didactic principles have been put to nefarious use, for the writers' ultimate purpose is to coax us to believe in the ASA's particular crea tion myth. That a religious organization has chosen the name American Scientific Affiliation must by itself arouse our suspicion of dishonesty. This claim to scientific legitimacy seems more sig nificant than the writers' failure to understand evolution in animals, their failure to consider symbiosis and karyotypic rearrangements when they discuss discontinuities in evolutionary lineages, their failure to include the central idea of self-generating systems when they discuss the origin of life, and their failure to grasp a simple idea—that organisms that have become similar through convergent evolution can nonetheless be related to each other through descent from common ancestors. These failings, serious as they are, are trivial in comparison with the writers' attempt to impose their particular religious beliefs on the rest of us. As bad as the booklet is, however, it can have some salutary effects. Analy zing creationist propaganda makes us more attentive to sloppy language and to anthropomorphic thinking, more sensitive to glib explanations and facile doctrines. It sharpens our reasoning. It teaches us to examine continually the evidence and the concepts that gave rise to Darwin's great unifying contribution to biology, as we integrate experimental details into the larger evolutionary scenario. We must resist the ASA's charming booklet, for we can deduce from their own phrases that the writers are neither driven by intellectual curiosity nor concerned with an accurate de scription of life on Earth. They are committed to biblical religion, and they want to impose their values and beliefs on our biology students. □ The Science Teacher/May 1987</page><page sequence="6">grasp if they are to understand how scientists think about fossils. One principle is this: No matter what the creationists may pretend, the fos sil record is not, and never has been, our major source of information about evolutionary relationships. This plain fact of science has eluded nearly all laypeople. It surely has eluded (or been suppressed by) the editors of school textbooks, for these often imply that evolutionary biology revolves around fossils. And creationists eagerly exploit the resulting ignorance. Another principle is this: A species is not an object but a stage in a pro cess. This is hard to grasp at first, because some unfortunate properties of our language make it easy for us to envision objects but difficult for us to envision processes. Australopithecus afaren sis, A. Africanus, and the rest were phases of a continuous process of evo lution, but we have named them as if they were discrete objects. It would be hard, perhaps impossible, to do other wise. In a way, then, our very practice of naming tends subtly to promote the creationists' view, in which organ isms always have existed as discrete kinds separated by obvious morpho logical gaps. The importance of overcoming this quirk of language is clear if we note that some implications of the evolu tionary scenario are not much differ ent from the corresponding implica tions of the creationists' scenario. This certainly is not true when we consider, say, comparative biochemistry or com parative anatomy; each provides phe nomena for which evolutionary biol ogy supplies compelling explanations, while creationism can supply no ex planations at all. But when we consider the fossil record, the situation is not so stark, as an example will show: According to the evolutionary view, all the placen tal mammals (of which more than 4000 species exist today) have descended from one placental species that arose some 90 million years ago from a nonplacental lineage. The evolutionary scenario also tells the number of true intermediate species that bridge the genealogical gap between that first placental species and its nonplacental relatives: exactly one. So even if the fossil record had preserved every mammalian species that ever lived, the record would still only hold one spe cies intermediate between the placen tal and the nonplacentals. Now, how many such intermediates are indicated in the creationists' scenario? Because they deny that any intermediates ever have existed, this answer is equally exact: zero. The difference between one and zero is small, yet it represents the maximum hypothetical difference between what a scientist might expect and what a creationist definitely &lt;foes expect. The real difference is much smaller, because no scientist considers it likely that the record will yield a fossil of that one intermediate species. To grasp how unlikely such a dis covery would be, consider how much of Earth's surface is exposed, fossil bearing rock that is 90 million years old. Surely much less than one per cent. And what is the likelihood that this intermediate species lived in a place represented in that rock? Again, much less than one percent. And the likeli hood that the species left fossils? Poor—making the chance of finding a fossil of that intermediate species—or any other intermediate species—pretty close to zero. So, the scientist's expec tation and the creationist's expectation are almost identical, though their rea sons are completely different. Am I saying that the fossil record is irrelevant to demonstrating evolution or to refuting creationism? No. I am saying that we should not expect to be able to reconstruct every lineage from fossils, because finding particu lar fossils depends cm unbelievably good luck. We can reconstruct lineages quite effectively and reliably by study ing the anatomy and biochemistry of living forms. The role of fossils here is not to tell the history of every species but to tell the history of life in general. And they tell us that the notion of a single cre ation event is nonsense. We see this because we never find all the forms of life mixed together in the same depos its: We do not find plesiosaurs and mosasaurs mixed with whales and seals; or elephants with brontosaurs; or saber-toothed cats with carnivo rous dinosaurs. Instead, we find inva riable, unambiguous evidence of a suc cession of forms in a grand process that has run through a vast span of time. This evidence was the fossil record's signal contribution to bring ing the evolutionary perspective into biology. □ —Larry Gibson Vincent Sarich Vincent Sarich, a pioneer in the study of hominid evolution by comparative biochemistry, is renowned for his work showing that the human lineage arose some 5 million years ago. He now is addressing questions about the evolution of human behavior. He is a professor in the Departments of Anthropology and Biochemis try, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720. As creationists invariably do, the ASA writers suggest that a gap in the fossil record, an "absence of transitional forms," sup ports the notion that organisms were specially created, pretty much as we see them today. This argument is wholly false, but it seems plausible to audiences who understand little of science. It seems so plausible, in fact, that some scientists have tried to answer it on its own terms—by talk ing as if gaps may really constitute significant data, or by pointing out that various sequences of transitional forms have actually been found. Such a reply may be informative and scientifically valid, as when we point to the excellent record relating our own species to Australopithecus afarensis—with A. africanus, Homo habilis, and H. erectus as intermediates. But a reply like that does nothing to teach the principles that your students must The Science Teacher/May 1987 41</page><page sequence="7">Robert Jurmain Robert Jurmain, a specialist in analyzing primate skeletons for information about health anil mortality, is working with fane Goodall on n study of the behavior of captive chimpanzees. His publications include Understanding Physical Anthropology and Archaeology (West Publishing, 1987). He is a professor in the Department of Anthropology, San Jose State University, San Jose, CA 95192. The writers of the ASA pam phlet conceal their motives and objectives, which are religious. They promote a "biology" devised by people who are not professional biol ogists, they offer a highly partisan selection of evidence, and they mis quote or misrepresent the views of people who are professional biologists. To teach about science, we must present the most reliable evidence and the most challenging theories; and we must do this in a way that is sensitive to the world views held by our diverse audiences. That requirement, however, cannot justify or excuse what the ASA writers do when they come to the origin of humans—my own area of expertise. They obfuscate, distort, and waffle to the point of pure nonsense. They begin by implying that the pervasive similarity between the DNA of humans and the DNA of the great apes may be due to convergence, rather than common ancestry. Yet the very reason for enlisting molecular compari sons is that they enable us to moid confusing convergence with shared descent. Human DNA and chimpan zee DNA show a structural correspon dence that approximates 99 percent. Can anyone really believe that humans and chimpanzees originated indepen dently, and that the correspondence of their DNAs represents convergence or coincidence? The ASA writers themselves sug gest the complexity of nucleic acids with an evocative simile: "Indeed, call ing something as intricately pro grammed as RNA or DNA a 'mole cule' is like calling an important novel 'a bunch of words.'" Can anyone really believe that two novels might origi nate separately but show a correspon dence of 99 percent in their words, letters, and punctuation marks? The writers promote an incredibly naive approach to the interpretation of fossils: They imply that we cannot infer evolutionary relationships unless we have a sequence of fossils, graded throughout geologic time, for each lineage and species involved. Professional paleontologists know better. What paleontologists do (and always have done) is to establish rela tionships among eludes, which are groups of related species. For exam ple, when we look at fossils of a spe cies of Sivapithecus and find affinities to the modern orangutan, we do not say that this particular species of Sivnpithe cus was a direct ancestor of the orang. It may have been, but it probably was not. It probably was a related species within the broad clade of oranglike species that lived during the Miocene. Only one of those species included the direct ancestors of the orang. Though we may never find a fossil of that spe cies, we can be quite confident that the orang and Sivapithecus are related. In the same way, Australopithecus nfaren sis (Lucy and friends) may not have been the direct ancestor of humans, but some species like it surely was. The ASA writers use their naive view of fossils to build a misleading discussion of "missing links." (The expression itself is obsolete yet per sists among laypeople.) The writers say that the requisite links are still missing. They are wrong. Using the fossil record now in hand and the tech niques now available for analyzing it, we can establish solid links among major clades for most of the history— some 30 million years of anthropoid evolution—in the Old World. The links are there. To tell students otherwise is distortion if not falsehood. The ASA writers begin their dis cussion of missing links by quoting a college textbook: "Though it is unfor tunate that a clear and uncomplicated picture of early hominid evolution cannot yet be presented, we fervently hope that future discoveries will pro vide evidence to bring the scenario into focus." This, they allege, summa rizes "the current situation in paleo anthropology." But the writers have taken that sentence out of context to suggest something that was not intended by the person who wrote it. I know this because I wrote it—for Introduction to Physical Anthropology (1982), by Harry Nelson and me. Clearly, my statement deals with our knowledge of early hominid evolu tion, not with the whole of paleoan thropology. Moreover, the statement— in context—concerns the difficulty of building an evolutionary picture that is clear and simple. In truth, we may never have such a picture, for we are learning every day that hominid evo lution was not simple. This does not mean, however, that we should be so ignorant, so naive, or so cowardly as to deny the evidence we have gathered or the knowledge we have gained. □ 42 The Science Teacher/May 1987</page><page sequence="8">—Erie Taylor Stephen Jay Gould Stephen jay Gould, a paleontologist and historian of science, is one of the most skillful and most prolific of the scientists who write for the general public about paleontology, evolution, and the ramification of life on Earth. He is currently at the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cam bridge, MA 02138. The writers of the ASA booklet, in trying to support supernaturalism by suggesting that scientists have no worthwhile ideas about the origin of animals, quoted an isolated sentence from a piece that Gould published in Natural History, in February 1984: "We can tell tales of improvements for some groups, but in honest moments we must admit that the history of complex life is more a story of multifarious variation about a set of basic designs than a saga of accumulating excellence." The misuse of my work offers a standard and telling example of why creationists do not follow the norms of science or the traditions of fair and decent argument— and must therefore be judged as ideo logues, not as promoters of honorable pluralism in debate. Their citation follows the lamenta ble rhetorical trick of the half quote, or quote out of context. My words, as cited, are taken to imply doubt that the record of fossil invertebrates dur ing the Phanerozoic provides evidence for evolution. But my statement, either placed back into the context of my original article, or merely analyzed for its own logic, is a denial that progress in design marks the pathways of evolu tion. It is not a denial that the path ways exist. My article, in fact, is an argument that punctuated equilibrium and mass extinction provide reasons within evolu tionary theory for why we should not expect progress as a major feature of the fossil record. The very next paragraph (after the one that they quote out of context) makes my point clearly. "Perhaps the expectation [of progress] itself is faulty, a product of pervasive, pro gressionist bias in Western thought and never a prediction of evolutionary theory." □ Alan M. Portis Alan M.

He is a pro fessor in the Department of Physics, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720. A science teacher plays two roles. In one role, the teacher acts as a representative of the scien tific community. He or she has a responsibility to present to students the views of that community and to assist students in understanding those views and the processes through which they were developed. The second role is that of mentor. In this role, the teacher is concerned —Rick Portis with the student's personal develop ment and with helping to integrate some knowledge and understanding of science into the student's total body of beliefs. I see these roles as distinct. In the first, the judgments are those of the scientific community. In the second the judgments must be those of the student, with the teacher serving as mentor but nothing more. It seems to me that the ASA publication seeks to advise the student (and teacher), but without adequately presenting the views of the scientific community. The ASA's publication, as its title indicates, is centrally concerned with controversy. We teachers are gener ally uncomfortable with controversy. We like to see ourselves as above the battle; and, when we are told that we are combatants, we look for ways to extricate ourselves. I suggest that it is inappropriate for a science teacher to offer what the ASA publication implies—a synthesis of science and religion. Just as science develops by internal controversy, so a tension between scientific and religious views may promote the personal development of our students. If we seek to avoid this tension by synthesiz ing both points of view, we may com promise science and deny our students an opportunity for growth. ■ The Science Teacher/May 7987 43</page></plain_text>
