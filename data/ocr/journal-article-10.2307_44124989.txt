Jones * Introduction Council-manager government has not met with much success in Utah. This situation prevails in spite of per- sistent and concerted efforts - particularly since World War II - to integrate the council-manager system within the fabric of Utah municipal government. Nearly every major municipality has either adopted and/or abandoned the system or has experienced a major campaign to estab- lish the system. At this time, only a small percentage of the total incorporated municipalities are functioning under council-manager government, and most of them under highly modified versions of the system. The purpose of this article is to suggest a new thesis why the council-manager system has not been integrated extensively into the political ethos of Utah, while noting that other systems of municipal government have per- formed effectively providing, in most cases, outstanding municipal services. In examining this situation, several approaches may be employed. The subject of this article is largely formulated within the concept of "systems" as advanced by Talcott Parsons. Social action becomes the starting point, and social systems develop spontaneously whenever the be- havior of two or more actors become stabilized (patterned mode of interaction) oriented toward specific goals. The basic element in the social system is role, and the social system is merely a network of roles.1 In on-going societies, all interactive systems develop within the matrix of an already established sociocultural system which plays an important part in the definitions * Garth Jones is in the School of Public Administration, Univer- sity of Southern California, Los Angeles, Cal.

Jonas of the University of Utah ; Professor William Gable of the University of Michigan; and Jeptha Carrell of Community Studies, Inc., Kansas City, Missouri. 1. The general properties of any social system, in Parsonian theory, are: 1) two or more actors occupying differentiated statuses or positions and performing differentiated roles, 2) some organized pattern governing the relationships of members and describing their rights and obligations with respect to each other, 3) some set of common norms and values, together with shared cultural objects and symbols, 4) system boundary-maintaining tendencies (i.e., there tends to be more integrated organization among the components of the system while it is operating, than there is be- tween these components and elements outside of the system), and 5) a built-in tendency toward system stability or equilibrium. For more details see Edward C. Devereux, Jr., "Parsons' Sociological Theory," in Max Black (ed.), The Social Theories of Talcott Par- sons , Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, 1961, pp. 26-27. of roles, normative standards, and system-goals. As view- ed within the dimension of this article, the matrix is the political ethos of Utah. Common to any complex political society is a system or systems of local government(s). Each unit of local government has to work out a set of mutually compatible roles (a concrete social system) within its political ethos. Building further upon this line of reasoning, each local government is in itself a complex of "concrete social systems." Thus, while analytically separable, concrete social systems interpentrate one an- other and function within a larger social system of inter- dependence. Concrete social systems are embedded in a larger sociocultural matrix (system): small systems are components of still larger ones. Each order of a concrete system represents in part its own unique organization and in part its organization drawn from higher and/or lower- order systems. Within the theoretical scope outlines, this article will analytically examine three systems. First is the political ethos of Utah, which - for a variety of reasons - has its own distinctive and peculiar regional character. Second is the social system of council-manager government. And the third is the social system of the profession of city managers. Council-manager government may, and does, operate without professional city managers, i.e., the em- ploying of a non-professional city manager. On the other hand, the profession of city managers can only function within a council-manager system. In simplified terms, this article examines the attempts to integrate the features of two of these social systems (council-manager government and/or the profession of city managers) into the political ethos system of Utah. Therefore, this is basically a study of human behavior in order to comprehend the reactions and responses of men in a particular political environment (conceived in the broadest sense). Here it is suggested that a sociocultural region exist, and that men living in a region marked with a peculiar socioculture acquire behavioral patterns which differentiate them from men living in other regions. This assumption, therefore, leads to the central theme of this article: that a regional socioculture influences the form and structure of municipal government, the social pro- cesses of municipal government, the kinds of policies and practices of municipal government, and the values, be- liefs and attitudes of the people living in the region to- ward their municipal government and community. Utah's Experience with Council-Manager Government The idea of council-manager government was intro- duced early in Utah. In 1916, only four years after the</page><page sequence="2">HUMAN ORGANIZATION 211 first city, Sumter, South Carolina, adopted the council- manager plan, Brigham City, a model of responsible and progressive municipal government, experimented with the idea which was formally adopted in 1920. Tooele, another small community, soon followed the Brigham City example by adopting a modified council-manager plan by ordinance in September, 1921. However, it was not until 1925 that the first city manager was appointed in Tooele. Local politics in 1926 decreed an abrupt end to the council-manager government in Brigham City while on the other hand - the system had functioned well in Tooele until around I960.2 Since then, strong op- position has developed toward the present governmental system, and in the general election of November, 1963 the voters by an impressive margin of three to one established a fifteen-member charter commission which has several persons strongly opposed to council-manager govern- ment.3 It was not until after World War II that the idea of council-manager government was seriously considered by a large number of Utah communities. As noted in Table I, four small communities between 194S and 1948 adopted the system. Until this time, the statutory law did not pro- vide for the council-manager system. These municipalities were operating under an elastic statutory provision which empowered the boards of commissioners and city councils to create any office they may deem necessary for good government . . . except as provided by law.4 Table I Experiences of Utah Municipalities with the Council- Manager Form of Government January 1963* Decennial No. Years Year Population Year Plan in No. Managers Municipality Adoption Decade Adopted 1960 Abandonment Operation Employed Brigham City 1920 5¿82 11,728 1926 5 2f Tooele 1921t 3,602 9,133 42 3 South Salt Lake City 194S 5,701 9,520 1958 12 3 Richfield 1947 3,584 4,412 16 Vernal 1947 2,119 3,655 16 3 Midvale 1947 3,996 5,802 1949 2 1 Nephi 1948 2,835 2,566 15 5 Cedar City 1950 6,106 7,543 1956 5 2 Montecello 1950 1,172 1,845 13 4 Ogden 1951 57,112 70,197 12 4 Bountiful 1953 6,004 17,039 10 3 Clearfield 1953 4,723 8,833 10 2 Orem 1953 8,351 18,394 10 2 Provo 1956 28,937 36,047 1961 5 2 Moab 1956 1,274 4,682 1958 2 1 Price 1957 6,010 6,802 1958 1 1 Layton 1960 4,682 4,682 3 1 ♦This table was constructed from a variety of sources.

Utah Code Annotated - 1943, Title 15-8-79</page><page sequence="3">212 HUMAN ORGANIZATION By 1953, it appeared that the council-manager system had at last become an accepted feature of Utah municipal government. At this time, there had been thirteen official adoptions and only two official abandonments. Further- more, besides these municipalities - which measured up to the qualifications of council-manager government as prescribed by the International City Managers' Associa- tion - there were ten additional communities operating under plans (quasi-forms) similar to those exercised by the city or town managers.6 Although four official adoptions occurred after 1953, some dissatisfaction with the council-manager system be- came evident. This is partially substantiated in Table I, where between the years 1920 to 1961 there were seven- teen adoptions and seven abandonments. Since 1957, only one community has officially adopted the council- manager system (although it will later be noted that several major efforts have failed in this regard); whereas four communities have officially abandoned the system. The climax of the sentiment against and resistance to council-manager government in the state was probably reached in 1961, when Provo City, in a turbulent cam- paign, abandoned its council-manager government, estab- lished in 1956 under constitutional home rule and re- verted to its former three-member commission form of government provided under statutory law for second- class cities.7 Since 1961, council-manager government has not received much active political consideration in Utah. A review of the quasi-forms of council-manager govern- ment does not reveal the same strong tendency. In 1963, 5. The structure of Utah municipal government is somewhat typical of that of the nation. In 1963, there were 213 incorporated cities and towns. These incorporated municipalities are classified into four classes according to population. First-class cities (only Salt Lake City is in this class) are those with 90,000 or more in- habitants. Second-class cities (only four are in this class: Ogden, Provo, Logan and Murray - the latter two cities qualified under prior statutory law) are those with at least 30,000 but fewer than 90,000 inhabitants. Third-class cities (86 cities are in this class) are those with a population of 800 to incorporate, but not more than 30,000. Towns (122 in this class) may be incorporated when they have a population of at least 100 but not more than 7,000. The law provides for five basic forms of municipal government: 1) the commission form for cities of the first class (mayor and four commissioners) and the second class (mayor and two commission- ers) ; 2) the weak mayor-council (mayor and five councilmen) form for third-class cities; 3) the president and town board (five members) form for towns; 4) the optional strong mayor form for any first or second class city. In addition 5), any municipality may frame its own government through the provisions of consti- tutional home rule. For further details, see an excellent description of Utah government, by Utah Foundation, State and Local Govern- ment in Utah, Salt Lake City, 1962. 6. See Roy V. Peel, "Forms and Problems of Local Government in Utah," University of Utah, Institute of Government, Salt Lake City, 1956 (dittoed), p. 122-126. This was prepared for the Local Government Survey Commission, a body created by the 1955 Utah State Legislature to investigate local government problems in Utah. 7. This story has been written up by Neil K. Coleman, "A Study of the Campaign for the Repeal of the Provo City Charter in 1961," unpublished Master's thesis, Department of Political Science, Brigham Young University, 1962. there were at least seven communities employing town or city managers. The modified manager version estab- lished under the "statutory elastic clause" appears to be holding its own against other forms of municipal govern- ment. However, it should be indicated that the formal powers of such managers do not measure up to those typically exercised by city managers. Their position is roughly analogous to that of business managers or similar types of positions.8 In sum, the statistical data of Table I indicate that council-manager government has not become a significant feature of Utah municipal government. Seven official abandonments have occurred. In other words, 41 percent of the municipalities which adopted council-manager government have officially abandoned the system. Except for Ogden, with a 1960 population of 70,197, not one major city is operating under the council-manager system. The system, including the quasi-forms, has been mod- erately successful only in small - and in most cases relatively isolated - regional agricultural communities.9 In addition to these statistical data, Utah's experience with constitutional home rule also reveals a reluctance to accept council-manager government. Constitutional home rule has never been a popular subject in Utah. Part of the reason may be that municipalities from their early fron- tier days have enjoyed considerable freedom, and the small population of the state made the state legislature particularly accessible and responsive to their demands. No matter what may be the reasons, constitutional home rule had not become a common feature of Utah municipal government, even though certain influential elements over the years have urged the adoption of this principle. Since the State Constitution was amended in 1932, only five attempts have been made to employ the constitu- tional home rule provisions: Spanish Fork, 1945; Ogden, 1951; Provo, 1953 (repealed in 1961); Salt Lake City, 1957; and Tooele, 1963. At this time, only one city - Ogden - is operating under constitutional home rule. The first four constitutional home rule movements incor- porated the council-manager form of government as the essential feature of their charters. The last one, Tooele, developed partly out of community opposition against council-manager government. A cursory examination of 8. This is certainly a difficult item to evaluate. Although desig- nated by official correspondence, etc., as city managers, such persons usually enjoy few of the formal powers associated with council-manager government. In most cases, they are not pro- fessional city managers, but usually some knowledgeable person who has long been associated with the municipality and the com- munity. In all cases, they are found only in the small communities, usually with populations between 800 and 2500. For a listing of such municipalities, see Directory of Utah Municipal Officials, 1962-1963 Utah Municipal League, Salt Lake City, 1962. 9. The possible exceptions here may be Orem, Clearfield, and Bountiful. However, all of these communities were agricultural centers (but not isolated in the sense of the other cities noted) until rather recently, when they were caught in a mushrooming urban growth. Agriculture in all communities is still a significant activity.</page><page sequence="4">HUMAN ORGANIZATION 213 these movements provides some revealing insights into the sentiments of Utahans regarding their municipal government. Spanish Fork (a small, compact community of 4,167 in 1940) was the first city in the state which attempted to employ the provisions of the constitutional home rule. An affirmative vote of four to one in the general election of November, 1945, was cast to set up a charter com- mission (the actual vote was 831 yes and 212 no). How- ever, during the following two years, dissensions de- veloped in the charter commission and within the com- munity concerning the nature of the charter. There was a strong conviction by many leading citizens that the council-manager form of government in Spanish Fork would eventually prove to be unsatisfactory. By the time of the election of November, 1947, the proposed charter had been examined by several attorneys and considered inadequate, and probably in conflict with state statutory law. The charter was shelved, the charter commission dissolved, and the charter never submitted to the elec- torate. These actions marked the end of this community's efforts to establish a council-manager form of government under constitutional home rule or permissive statutory law.10 Ogden, the second largest city, with a population of 70,197 in 1960, was the first city of the state - in 1951 - to adopt constitutional home rule. The plan - since its inception - has been subject to considerable anti-city- manager pressures, even reaching the point of placing this issue upon the ballot on two separate occasions. The first was in 1957, where the proposal to abandon the sys- tem was defeated by a vote of 8,870 against to 6,650 in favor.11 The proposal was again submitted in 1963 where it was defeated by 9,176 to 7,684.12 Provo, the third largest city, with a population of 36,047 in 1960, became the second city of the state (charter com- mission established in 1953 ) to adopt constitutional home rule. In 1945, a measure to establish a constitutional home rule charter commission was voted down in the November election by 1,343 votes for the commission and 3,064 against the commission The matter was dormant for sev- eral years, but, in 1953, renewed interest was shown in constitutional home rule. By a narrow margin of 67 votes, in November, 1953, a fifteen-member charter commission was established. On August 2, 1955, the charter provid- ing for a council-manager system was approved by a narrow margin of only twenty-five votes. Five and a half years later, on November 7, 1961, the charter was 10. Most of the details of this rejection have been written up by F. Robert Paulsen, Utah Experience With Constitutional Home Rule , University of Utah, Institute of Government, Salt Lake City, 1948. 11. Statistics taken from Professor J. D. Williams, The Defeat of Home Rule in Salt Lake City , Cases in Practical Politics, No. 2, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York, 1960, p. 30. 12. Personal letter to Garth N. Jones from Ogden City Clerk, November 19, 1963. solidly repealed by a vote of 4,918 for repeal and 3,771 for retention.13 The city returned to its former three-member commission form of government as provided by state statute.14 In 1955, a campaign was launched by a newly organized citizens' group named the "Home Rule Committee of Salt Lake City," to establish in Salt Lake City (the largest city and capital of the state, with a population of 189,454 in 1960) the council-manager form under constitutional home rule. After a hard-fought campaign in which the leading powers of the community and even of the state were involved, the measure to set up a charter commis- sion in 1957 was turned down by a two-to-one margin (13,729 for and 22,796 against). While significant ele- ments were certainly displeased with the five-member commission form of government provided by statute for first-class cities (Salt Lake City is the only first-class city), the political sentiment was decidedly against the council-manager system. However, there were strong in- dications that the strong mayor-council system would be acceptable.15 In 1921 Tooele became the second city to adopt council- manager government. During the late 1950's, there de- veloped some feeling in certain quarters against the sys- tem which is probably a normal occurrence. By 1961 this feeling had grown to a sizeable sector of the community, and in the 1963 November general election the voters approved in a large election turnout the proposal for the establishment of a fifteen-member charter commission. Several of the leading supporters of council-manager gov- ernment were defeated. One of the community's chief critics of council-manager government led in number of votes cast for the charter commission. It appears that the sentiment in this community is in favor of a strong-mayor system.16 All of this seems to add up to the conclusion that Utahans hold strong reservations about council-manager government.17 Many local leaders may not fully under- stand the system, but to date a substantial number - par- 13.

As an interesting sidelight, in spite of all these irritants, Provo City was awarded, in 1962, an honorable mention citation in the All-American Cities Award for 1961. See Western City, XXXVII (May, 1962), 31. IS. Williams, op. cit . 16. Deseret News and Telegram, November 6, 1963, A 1-5. Part of this information was also secured in a personal interview with the present city manager, Sidney Noble, October 14, 1963. 17. The evidence of a less concrete nature is voluminous. No at- tempt will be made here to sum up this aspect. However, it should be noted that the only two other major municipalities not yet men- tioned - Logan, with a population of 18,731 in 1960, and Murray, with a population of 16,806 in 1960 - have also experienced rather strong pressures to incorporate the council-manager form of gov- ernment by constitutional home rule. Although a little out-of-date on this subject, see G. H. Durham, Municipal Administration in Logan City, Logan Junior Chamber of Commerce, Logan, Utah, 1941 ; and Thomas W. Thorsen, op. cit .</page><page sequence="5">214 HUMAN ORGANIZATION ticularly those living in the larger and wealthier com- munities - have manifested in a wide variety of ways that they do not want to live under this form of municipal government.18 An interesting aspect of the whole situation is that Utah communities prefer to function within forms of government (the weak mayor-council and the commis- sion types) that are generally regarded alike by scholars and practitioners of government as not suitable for the demands of modern municipal government. Furthermore, these two systems, which have much in common, have not necessarily been imposed by statute upon the munici- palities. By permissive provisions of statutory law and constitutional home rule, Utah communities can readily adopt any form of municipal government they so desire. In spite of these provisions, only fifteen third-class cities (or 17 percent) out of eighty-six have chosen to establish at one time or another the optional city manager system. All that is necessary is a municipal ordinance to this effect. Not one town has exercised this prerogative. No first- or second-class city has ever initiated the establish- ment of the optional strong mayor form of government. Such a measure must be submitted to vote of the elector- ate at a special election. The System of Council-Manager Government Earlier it was suggested that the profession of city managers constituted a social system. In simple terms, professionals behave and react in a systematic pattern according to a set of norms that they have learned as members of their profession. In a broader sense, there is also a system of council-manager government. Basic roles of individuals, groups, and organizations (these are termed behavior units19) are structured in a complex net- work of roles oriented toward specific goals. Viable norms govern the relationship of the manager to his council, the mayor to the manager, the mayor-council to the munici- pal administrative organization and a host of other social arrangements. Both the profession of city managers and the system of council-manager government represent dis- crete social systems which can be independently analyzed. 18. Utah also ranks high in the nation in the number of abandon- ments of council-manager government. In a preliminary study prepared by Jeptha J. Carrell, Community Studies Inc., Kansas City, Missouri, only four states had a higher percentage of abandon- ments: over 100%, two states (Alabama and South Dakota); 40% to 100%, four states (Arkansas, North Dakota, Utah, and Wiscon- sin) ; 10% to 40%, twelve states; under 10%, nineteen states; and no abandonments, nine states. This study was appended in a per- sonal letter to Garth N. Jones from Jeptha J. Carrell, November 2, 1962. 19. This term is used within the definition given by Kenneth E. Boulding, Conflict and Defense , A General Theory , Harper Torch- books, New York, 1962, p. 2, i.e., "Some aggregate or organization that is capable of assuming a number of different positions while retaining a common identity or boundary. A behavior unit may be a person, a species of animals or artifacts, a class of ideas, a theory, or a social organization. . . ." Since any social system must be inferred from obser- vation of uniformities in behavior and reaction of the principal behavior units (actors); it is to some extent an imperfect construct of the observer(s). The difficulties here are further compounded when it is realized that we are dealing with over 1,840 council-manager cities scat- tered throughout the United States, each city - more or less - having its own unique sociocultural system. Thus, we are caught in the dilemma of making generalizations upon generalizations in order to determine whether or not a social system typology of council-manager govern- ment exists! Students of government have largely avoided this topic - and maybe rightfully so. The proponents of council- manager government, on the other hand, early advanced doctrinal tenets on which council-manager government was to function. However, some astute observers did quickly note limitations of these tenets, but scholars did not readily follow their leads.20 Thus, the basic assump- tions, until rather recently, went largely unassailed. As a result of a rash of community studies, many by socio- logists, and recent difficulties experienced by city man- agers, perceptive practitioners and scholars alike have commenced to take a new hard look at council-manager government. Basic tenets, at last, are being subjected to empirical tests, and preliminary findings already reveal sufficient evidence to warrant further exploration.21 The doctrine of council-manager government, as it has emerged over the last five decades, is a product of a pro- found distrust of politics created by the reform move- 20. Two significant works on this point are Leonard D. White, The City Manager , University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1927 and Harold Stone, Don K. Price, and Katherine H. Stone, City Manager Government in the United States , Public Administration Service, Chicago, 1940. 21. In the early 1950's, Wallace S. Sayre wrote two provocative articles on council-manager government which departed somewhat from the traditional theme: "The General Manager Idea for Large Cities," Public Administration Review, XIV, (Autumn, 1954), 253-258; and "Inter-University Summer Seminar in Politi- cal Behavior, Research in Political Behavior," American Political Science Review, XLVI, (December, 1952) 1003-32. In 1950 and 1951, Edwin O. Stene and George K. Floro undertook some field investigations of the abandonments of the manager plan. Their published findings certainly open some new avenues for investiga- tion: Abandonment of the Manager Plan, University of Kansas, Governmental Research Series No. 9, Lawrence, 1953. In the late fifties and early sixties, interest again revived, with most of the attention centered upon the city manager. In this regard, see particularly three studies by Jeptha Carrell: The Role of the City Manager , Community Studies, Inc., Kansas City, Missouri, 1962; "The Role of the City Manager: A Survey Report," Public Man- agement, XLIV (April, 1962), 74-78; and "The City Manager and His Council: Sources of Conflict," Public Administration Review, XXII (December, 1962) , 202-208.

Other problems, particularly the struggle for survival of the dominant Mormon social ele- ment - which was still a real issue for the first three decades of the twentieth century - absorbed the princi- pal energies and thoughts of the citizens of Utah. Fur- thermore, what were reform issues elsewhere had for the most part already become accepted features of Utah gov- ernment, such as the commission form of government (in- troduced in 1911), woman suffrage (1870)23, and work- men's compensation (1912). In short, within the domi- nant socioculture there was little to reform. The state generally had effective and honest municipal government, at least considerably better than was generally found elsewhere. The basic provisions of the council-manager plan are relatively simple: 1) a small lay council elected at large on a non-partisan basis is given all legislative powers, and 2 ) a chief administrator, the city manager, who serves at the pleasure of the council, is responsible for all adminis- tration. The separation of politics and administration is embraced as sound causal and normative theory. While policy initiation was originally conceived as an important function of the city manager, this was not initially identified as political in nature. This matter has been eschewed for five decades, and since World War II has been placed in a more realistic framework as a politi- cal item with which the manager must deal 24 As to the general structure of government, the council- manager system downgrades the mayor in importance, leaving him little more work, status, and influence than that of an ordinary councilman. The model city charter provides that the mayor shall be elected from one of the council members. This provision thereby handicaps any possibility that the mayor may acquire a separate base of political power through popular election. The council was purposely severed from the political parties by non- 22. The history of the plan and its past operations have been detailed in several works: Stone, Price, and Stone, op . cit.; White, op . cit.; Clarence E. Ridley and Orin F. Nolting, The City Man- ager Profession, University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1934; and Arthur W. Bromage, Manager Plan Abandonments , The National Municipal League, New York, 1959. 23. Utah was the second territory of state to grant woman suf- frage. Wyoming was first, in 1896. 24. This is apparently still a debatable item in some quarters. See particularly the exchange of views published in Public Man- agement , XLIV (February, 1962), 26-30, between H. G. Pope, "Is the Manager a Political Leader? No," and Gladys M. Kammerer, "Is the Manager a Political Leader? Yes." Two excellent articles which strongly support the political dimension are Charles R.

The proponents of council-manager government have been ambivalent on the matter of policy (political) leadership by the mayor. In one case, they state that the mayor is the leader on questions of public policy and in another they point out the futility of the city manager in working through the mayor on these questions.25 The question of political leadership and support is a major one. But no matter what the political setting may be, the basic tenets of council-manager government pre- scribe that the city manager become a key figure in some type of power system which includes both the internal (city administration) and the external (community) as- pects. The prescriptions pertaining to the former aspect are clear. Separation of powers has been incorporated as a significant feature of the council-manager system. The manager heads all administrative units of the city, and appoints and removes all administrative personnel, free from interference by the city council. The prescriptions pertaining to the latter - the com- munity - aspects are not as clear. Political leadership is postulated as coming from a collégial body. The manager is legitimately a political recommender, so long as he does not campaign in the city for the policies he proposes.26 Yet, under any circumstance, this is a delicate situation, and doubtless a source of much difficulty between the council and the manager.27 Could one be so bold as to venture to say that the leadership position of the man- ager demands that he perform a substantial role in the community political processes? How he performs this role is governed by the political ethos of the community. In this regard, there are no neat prescriptions to govern his actions. City managers realize this feature of the sys- tem, and, following Child's concept of a policy recom- mender, have rationalized their political involvement up- on these grounds: 1) they know the community problems better than anyone else; 2) the council frequently fails to carry out its policy-making responsibility; 3) political leadership needs to be continual and exercised by one person; and 4) the increasing complexity of community affairs and problems forces political leadership out of the hands of the amateur and into the hands of the expert.28 Professionalism in the manager has been another car- 25.

This has been thought of in the terms of educational background, career orientation, and appoint- ment of a person locally or outside - preferably the latter. The professional trend has been away from domination by the engineer and toward social science training, es- pecially graduate work in public administration. The in- ference of all of this is to give another facet to the divorce of administration from politics. The Socioculture of Utah From the outset it should be admitted that any treatise on the socioculture of Utah is a major scholarly under- taking. Few regions in the United States have experienced as much historical controversy; and, only recently, with the tempering influence of time, has it been possible to formalize some objective conclusions. Therefore, while the literature on the socioculture reaches overwhelming pro- portions, most of it is heatedly written to prove a point, to substantiate or discredit the position of the dominant religious institution of the region, the Mormon Church.29 Mormonism has placed its indelible stamp upon the socioculture of Utah, influencing and shaping alike the lives and the behavior of Gentile30 and Mormon. In the words of a leading non-Mormon scholar, Professor Thomas F. O'Dea. The Latter-day Saints have successfully created a Mormon community with its own values and social structure, although no longer a separate entity but is rather very much a part, both geographically and sentimentally, of the larger secular society of the United States.81 How did this peculiar American religious institution carve out, against fierce opposition and tremendous ob- stacles, such a peculiar regional sub-culture? Perhaps, in this regard, the words of one of America's leading economists, Professor Richard T. Ely, will give one of the best clues. He wrote, over half a century ago: So far as I can judge from what I have seen, the organization of the Mormons is the most nearly per- fect piece of social mechanism with which I have ever, in any way, come into contact, except the German Army alone.32 The renowned Russian novelist-philosopher, Count Leo Tolstoy, also gave another clue when he referred to 29. The official title is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS). Formerly, the LDS Church disapproved of the nickname "Mormon Church." Now it seems to have official ap- proval. 30. "Gentile" is the Mormon term for a non-Mormon. 31. The Mormons , University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1957, 222. 32. Richard T. Ely, "Economic Aspects of Mormonism," Harpers Magazine , CVI (April, 1903), 668. "Mormonism" as "The American Religion." He told U. S. Ambassador Andrew D. White, The Mormons teach the people not only of heaven . . . but how to live so that their social and economic re- lations with each other are placed on a sound basis.33 Thus, the philosophy of Mormonism incorporates nearly all of the idealism of the American nation. This is truly the unique aspect of Mormonism - much overlooked, how- ever, by many, in the emotions of the historical struggles. Certainly the perceptions of Tolstoy and Ely account for much of the success of the Morman experience. In short, the history of Mormonism is a history of superb organization in the fullest dimension of the word. The Mormon socioculture has exhibited the ability to maintain strong organization, not only encompassing large numbers and geographical areas but also measuring up to the ideals of high efficiency, i.e., the rate at which the or- ganization concerts valued input to valued output. Thus, the socioculture is able to accord high-valued efficiency in a situation which imposes many competing demands up- on the social mechanism. Here we see in operation a ra- tionally conceived and structured organization working with scarce means to attain many competing ends in a socially satisfactory manner.34 The theology of Mormonism denies the orthodox Chris- tian tenet that God created the world ex nihilo. All matter is eternal. Spirit is matter, but it is more fine or pure, and can only be discerned by purer eyes. Involved are innumerable interactions of three major gen- eral categories of elements: matter, energy, and intelli- gence (wills), held together by a great law. This con- ception of the universe is one characterized by an ongoing process of organization and reorganization of increasing complexity. God and man are seen as a part of the world of time and space. The conception of God is anthropomorphic in nature. Joseph Smith, the founder of the Church of the Latter Day Saints, responded to a question, What sort of being was God in the beginning? [in these words] God himself was once as we are now, 33. Quoted by Gustave O. Larson, Prelude to the Kingdom: Mor- mon Desert Conquest, A Chapter in American Cooperative Ex- perience , Marshall Jones Co., Francetown, New Hampshire, 1947, 309. 34. Nothing so differentiates cultures as the ability to maintain large-scale formal organizations. This is the critical factor for social progress, and one often overlooked. Edward C. Banfield, The Moral Basis of a Backward Society , The Free Press, Glencoe, Illinois, 1958 in this regard says, on page 8: "People live and think in different ways, and some of these are radically inconsis- tent with the requirements of formal organization. One could not, for example, create a powerful organization in a place where everyone could satisfy his aspiration by reaching out his hand to the nearest coconut. Nor could one create a formal organization in a place where no one would accept orders or decisions."</page><page sequence="8">HUMAN ORGANIZATION 217 and is an exalted man, and sits enthroned in yonder heavens . . . ,35 Mormonism is a product of its time. The church was officially organized in 1830. This was the time when com- mon men were beginning to exert their position and con- ceive great expectations for self-improvement based upon individual effort.36 The Manifest Destiny had been con- ceived. Already the American ideal had become firmly rooted; the United States had attained a perfection of ideology and institutions which were universally suitable and applicable. Subsequently, there developed a strong American desire - reaching Messianic zeal - to spread and defend its ideal. God is regarded as the supreme intelligent Being in the universe, with the greatest knowledge and the most perfected will, and who, therefore, possesses infinite power over the forces of the universe.37 God, like man, is subject to the law of progression. Thus, God achieved his present status (in the midst of this eternal, dynamic, and self-complicating universe) through his own effort. In sum, under Mormon theology, man is endowed with the properties to progress unto the quality of Godhood. Man and his place in the universe fits within the law of progression. God and man cooperate together, but not as a cooperation between equals. God aids man and shows him the way of progression. This requires man to abide by the laws of God. However, without man, God could not conceivably possess his power in the sense just noted. The church is the earthly channel by which God, through revelation, assists man in his eternal growth, a literal pro- gression to Godhood. In the context of time and space, God and man together will raise themselves to greater control and mastery over the elements (energy and ma- terial) of the universe. On man's part, his progress toward perfection will require active effort, obedience to God's law, and the acquisition of knowledge. 35.

Persons who are not well-versed in the religion will gain little from reading its basic scriptures. Com- mentaries and treatises of various types are recommended. Here are some references from which this part of the article was largely derived: Thomas F. O'Dea, The Mormons, 1957 (a scholarly work written by a non-Mormon) ; John A. Widtsoe (ed.), Priest- hood and Church Government in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, Deseret Book Co., Salt Lake City, 1954 - a lead- ing Mormon scientist, educator and church leader; and James E.

See also the other refer- ences noted in this section. 37. John D. Widtsoe, Rational Theology , Deseret Book Co., Salt Lake City, 1952, 24. The family is regarded as a divine institution, insti- tuted by God as the primary vehicle for eternal pro- gression. Much of the religious ordinances of the Mormon Church center around this concept. Mormons consider the most important aspect of their religion the "restoration of the ancient priesthoods" with all of the priestly orders of both the Old and New Testaments. The result is a highly complex, hierarchical lay-male priesthood structure which is headed by a pro- phet, the President of the Church, whose authority flows down and outward. There are no paid clergymen or other types of professionals in the church organization. While women are excluded from the priesthood, the Mormon Church has developed auxiliary organizations in which they may assume responsible positions in church organiza- tion. Built into Mormonism is the logical version of the American attitude of practical activism. The gospel em- braces not only spiritual salvation but also temporal salvation. It admonishes its adherents to be active and oriented toward accomplishment. The importance of "present time" is expressed: utilize to the fullest extent "present time," which holds the keys for greater blessings tomorrow. There is no place for idlers! Professor O'Dea writes that for a Mormon: Life is more than a vocation, more than a calling; it is an opportunity for deification through conquest, which is to be won through rational mastery of the environment and obedience to the ordinances of the church.38 He then goes on to say that: This doctrine, permeating individual and com- munity life, is expressed today in a configuration of attitudes clustering around activity and develop- ment. This configuration represents an important as- pect of the individual's integration into the life of the Mormon group, for it relates the striving of indi- viduals to collectively prescribed ends . Moreover, since it is taught by exhortation and example from early childhood, this set of attitudes becomes second nature to those brought up in the Mormon home and community environment. It becomes the link be- tween publicly preached and privately held versions of Mormon heritage, so far as practical attitudes are concerned. We have called this set of attitudes work , health , recreation , and education complex?® At this point, it is not necessary to elaborate upon the so-called set of attitudes relating to work, health, recrea- tion, and education, except to note that they fit totally within the practical activism of Mormon outlook and 38.

Freedom, rationality, progress, self-improvement, and mastery of the universe (world) are its basic principles. These are comprehended within an authoritarian framework, where centrally directed cooperation characterizes the relation- ship between God and man. This relationship is reflected in a closely-knit church, authoritarian in structure, and an elaborate priesthood organization. The significant question is, of course, the nature and extent of Mor- mon theology's effect upon human behavior in Utah. Part of this question will now be examined in reference to the context of this article. Congruent and Incongruent Features of the Systems This stage of the article deals with the congruent and incongruent features of the three social systems under ex- amination. The prime concern is the degree of system in- tegration that has taken place or appears possible. This is an extremely difficult subject. Social organization, to be meaningful here, must be viewed in its fullest dimen- sion including the integration of structure, function, and mechanism (processes). To facilitate this analysis, six component parts of social organization have been iso- lated: 1) political leadership; 2) authority and power; 3) policy and administration; 4) professionalism; 5) decision-making process; and 6) community dynamics. Political Leadership Mormonism was born into a society where people were expected to govern themselves, or at the very least to be consulted on how they were to be governed. Much of Jeffersonian-Jacksonian idealism was early incorpor- ated into Mormon life, reflected not only in governmental institutions but also in democratic performance. Whereas much of Jeffersonianism-Jacksonianism was thrust aside 40. Part of the germination process of this article took place with my work with city officials in the Southern California area. In this area are approximately 200,000 Mormons- a small percentage considering the total metropolitan population of well over 6,000,000. However, I noticed that there seems to be a Mormon on nearly every city council. I then started inquiries on this point, and the response of one official certainly indicates the validity of the above set of values: "Hell, yes! We always have a Mormon on the council, and they always take over the recreation post. I can- not understand how they get their youth to turn out in such large numbers. They take over the place. Thank God in our city they just built a new recreation center!" 41. A few interesting statistics on this point will be noted. Ac- cording to the Ü. S. Bureau of the Census (I960), persons 25 years old or older had, on the average, a little more than nine years of formal schooling. Utah led the nation with 12 years of schooling. In the 1960 Presidential election, the nation-wide average of per- centage of voters who voted was 65.3. In Utah, it was 79.6, the highest of the nation. by the forces released with industrialization, this was not necessarily the case in Utah. The Utah communities have been able to narrow the gap, with remarkable success, between the democratic promise (the ideal) and the democratic performance (the real). This aspect will be particularly dealt with under the section on community dynamics. The Mormon value of achievement, with its practical activism orientation, has been very much infused into Utah political life. Leaders are expected to be men of action, and usually maintain their positions only if they are able to point to accomplishments - for the most part, of a material nature. This goal achievement, largely meas- ured in material terms, becomes paramount in the minds of political leaders. The ballot box - as the essential democratic institution -plays a meaningful role in Utah political life. Utah has a two-party system, and neither party wins by much of a landslide.42 Political life is a precarious business, and only a few persons have been able to maintain their leader- ship positions over any extended period of time.43 All of this adds up to the fact that political leadership must be organizationally based in political parties. The non-partisan device has not effectively sterilized the party political process. Municipal elections appear to be very much "partisan non-partisan affairs." Political action, however, must be geared toward accomplishment for the benefit of the community. The electorate generally will not tolerate incompetency. Politicians must include with- in their organizations men who are competent and able to carry out policy and administrative programs. Thus, there is a built-in tendency to appoint to office men of merit, rather than for other considerations.44 Such a political environment certainly curtails charis- matic leadership. In fact, it is difficult to single out one obvious example of charisma. In summary, the idea of not having a person in high- level policy and/or administrative positions in local gov- ernment directly responsible to the electorate for their 42. The best simple treatise on Utah politics is by Frank H. Jonas, "Utah the Crossroads of the West," in Frank H. Jonas (ed.), Western Politics, University of Utah Press, Salt Lake City, 1961.

This aspect of Utah government is now being studied to great lengths by Garth N. Jones and Frank H. Jonas. Their findings will be published in the Utah Historical Quarterly .

The ballot box and pub- lic hearings and meetings are real and meaningful insti- tutions. Probably no aspect of council-manager govern- ment is so perplexing to the Utah citizens as the city manager in a power role but not directly responsible to the election process. The Jacksonian ethic reinforced by Mormon values of individual activism and social respon- sibility cannot quite work within the loose leadership framework of council-manager government. The practical mind of the typical Utahan cannot easily fathom the theoretical differences between policy and administration, as incorporated in council-manager government. To him, they are one and the same "thing." However, he well understands authority and power within a hierarchical organization. This is explained in the next topic. Authority and Power The problem of authority and power is one that every community must resolve in some manner, for the coor- dination and stability of social life depends upon its solu- tion. Mormon communities face this problem in an inten- sified form. Mormonism is not only a religious body but also a total community, and in areas where there are large Gentile populations, it withdraws and forms itself into rather self-contained social entities.45 On the other hand, the social dynamics of Mormonism breed a gregarious type of person who mingles freely and openly with Gentiles. As a result, the Mormon community does not form itself into ghettos (using this word in the broadest possible sense), but rather the population disperses itself throughout the Gentile community.46 In the religious community, authority and power (and in Mormon religious organization, these flow almost to- gether) is posited in the President of the Church, who is a prophet believed to be divinely chosen and directed. He is guided by contemporary revelation. In addition to this prophetic leadership, there exists a complicated and highly effectual hierarchical church structure, with 45. Mormon colonization of the Rocky Mountains and part of Southern California is one of the great epics of the Far West. However, particularly with the discovery of gold in California, in 1848, and the subsequent large gentile population, the Mormons were never able to consolidate completely their "grand coloniza- tion designs." Thus, there are large Mormon communities outside of Utah which would provide interesting sociological materials as to the extent of this social self-containment. For a fascinating empirical study of a micro-situation, see Florence Rockweed Kluckhohn and Fred L. Strodtbeck, Variations in Value Orienta- tions, Row, Peterson and Co., New York, 1961. 46. When there is a concentration of Mormons within a com- munity, it is usually historical chance; the Mormons were there first and later over-whelmed by gentiles. Southern California is a good example. Although there is a sufficient Mormon population to maintain a geographical community, this is not the case. Mor- mons are scattered throughout the area, exhibiting even no usual population concentration around their principal places of worship. Thus, the community is evident in social relationships and support given to the Church, rather than in population concentration. authority flowing down and outward. Within this or- ganization, authority and power responsibilities are clear- ly spelled out.47 As noted earlier, Mormonism was bom in a democratic environment and inherited a strong predilection toward democratic behavior. Thus, the Church has a tradition of Congregationalism. Although it seems nigh impossible, Church organization and practice have been able to harmonize authoritarian prophetic leadership - and, in the process, binding charisma within its organizational form - with the strong congregationalist tendencies.48 This will be explained in the subsequent topics, particu- larly in the one on community dynamics. How does this elaborate and comprehensive organiza- tion relate to the community? This is certainly a difficult question to answer. In Mormon doctrine, there is a gen- uine admonishment that church members should serve their government as well as their church. Historically, there has been much ambivalence by the church toward the United States Government. But, then, that is an- other story. On the local level, this has not constituted a serious problem. Since all male members are members of the priesthood and women have been given strong positions in auxiliary church organizations, there occurs considerable overlap of personnel and top leaders in both the church and the municipal government (all gov- ernment, for that matter).49 Thus, these individuals are wearing, figuratively, "two hats" at the same time. While there have been no extensive empirical studies, the social integration of church and municipal govern- ment affairs in the form of one person serving in two capacities certainly poses some interesting possibilities for role conflict - for example, a city manager giving instructions to his public works director, who is also his Bishop! This appears to be the critical problem for all government in Utah; role conflict - so it logically seems - can be avoided or minimized only if persons hold com- parable positions in both organizational systems. Policy and Administration The separation of policy and administration has been one of the primary tenets of council-manager government. Yet a strong commitment to the democratic process (and the term is used in the broadest sense - the organization 47. The subject is much too large to examine here. An excellent article on the subject was written by a student of public admin- istration, George Homer Durham, "Administrative Organization of the Mormon Church," Political Science Quarterly , LXVIII (Summer, 1945), 51-71. 48. The historical story of these aspects has been succinctly sum- marized by O'Dea, The Mormons , 155-165. 49. Thus, even Apostles have accepted top legislative and ex- ecutive positions, even in the national cabinet. Brigham Young was both President of the Church and Territorial Governor. The story goes that he was so conscious of the separation of church and state that although he had only one office, he used two desks to transact business: one for Church affairs and one for territorial affairs.</page><page sequence="11">220 HUMAN ORGANIZATION of municipal government administration as well as the community-at-large) certainly complicates the relation- ship between the "policy-makers" and the "policy-doers." On the surface, it appears that the Jacksonian frame- work of Utah local government is not conducive to any type of neat dichotomies. Politics and administration ap- pear to be treated largely as one and the same thing. On the other hand, the organization of the church has some- what successfully dealt with the problem of the demands for popular voice within hierarchical structures. This as- pect has to some degree been unconsciously built into local government by the "two hat" role mentioned earlier: Mormons serving concurrently in high church and governmental positions. Thus, structured within local government - much of it informal - is a system of policy advice through the organizational echelons. In other terms, the attitudes and behavior patterns developed by association with the organization of the Mormon Church, which has been described as the people, men and women, under God, the ruler of the Church,50 also carries over into local government. The conceptuali- zation of policy and administration so neatly spelled out in council-manager doctrine is rather crude when com- pared with the highly sophisticated policy-administration continuum employed by the Mormon Church. Certainly, council-manager government would have to make some significant refinements on this score before it would be successful within the Utah culture.51 Professionalism Probably no single aspect of the subject which we are examining brings the culture values into sharper conflict than the topic dealing with professionalism. As noted earlier, the Mormon Church has no professional clergy. There is no professional school or institution such as a school of theology to prepare its religious leaders. The leadership of the church is drawn from its active members, and, except for the General Authorities and others whom they appoint as their assistants, who receive stipends sufficient to enable them to live on a respectable stand- ard,52 all serve without pay. There are, however, full-time employees in important administrative positions and a large white-collar staff. Thus, a bureaucracy has emerged with both paid and non-paid staff. However, nearly all of 50. Widtsoe, Priesthood and Church Government , 234. 51. The practices of the Mormon Church certainly fit within the policy-administration continuum concept as outlined particularly by John M. Pfiffner and Frank P. Sherwood, Administrative Or- ganization, Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, 1960, p. 82 et seq. 52. The top leadership of the Mormon Church consists of a body of men called "General Authorities." They number 26 members, consisting of the major Church offices. For further details, see Durham, op. cit. it is under the leadership of non-paid persons who, for the most part, must continue working in their own businesses, professions, or jobs. This attitude toward non-professionalism in church administration and theology has spread over into the gov- ernment sphere. On the other hand, the social dynamics of Mormonism produces many - if not a superabundant number of - competent administrators who are equally well grounded in Mormon theology. Almost unconsciously, these individuals become professional administrators, thrust by the dynamics of the community organizational system into leadership responsibilities. The total social system in Utah has an amazing quality of developing and retaining such persons, including Mormon and Gentile alike. Social movement is flexible, and encounters - ex- cept for the highest positions in the church - a surprisingly small number of social rigidities and resistances.53 Decision-Making Process What is said here certainly touches upon every other aspect mentioned, and, indeed, even many others. The new apostles of organization theory have placed the decision-making process in such a prominent place that it has become almost the sole focal point of study. The theological value of cooperation between man and God has become formalized into Mormon organization and dynamics. While individualism is accorded a wide sphere of action, the decision-making process (because of the strong predilection toward cooperative behavior) tends to be highly collégial in nature, much in keeping with face-to-face, group, democratic dynamics. This is reflected in the total formal organizational structure of the church. Nearly every major office and/or organiza- tion, from the top to the bottom, is headed by a president (or equivalent title) and his two counselors. Although the president is given full authority and responsibility over his jurisdictional responsibility, he certainly leans heavily upon his counselors, and decisions are nearly al- ways announced in a plural sense, such as "we, the presi- dency. . . Major decisions, and many minor ones, are submitted to the group for acceptance or rejection. In most cases, this is a routine matter. However, before the decision has been made, careful evaluation of the possible consequence has been investigated to great lengths by higher authority. Every possible avenue is explored, and controversial mat- ters are usually skillfully handled. Seldom is a decision made unless there is rather substantial evidence that it will be acceptable to the members of the group. Thus, decision-making is an open affair. Secrecy, pressure manipulation and similar characteristics are not typical in the decision process. 53. Part of this is undoubtedly due to the lay priesthood, a situa- tion where social and class distinctions break down. A plumber and a medical doctor, for example, will jointly - working side by side - perform ordinances of the Church.</page><page sequence="12">HUMAN ORGANIZATION 221 If anything typifies the decision-making process, it is definitely the using of the committee approach to make decisions within a formal power and authority hierarchi- cal structure.54 Such a committee contains nearly all of the ingredients necessary for social action: power, authority, expertise, etc. In this sense, it is not unlike the three-member commission form of municipal government, or probably a better comparison would be the adminis- trator-chairman type of commission recommended by the 1949 Hoover Commission for the U. S. Civil Service Com- mission.55 Community Dynamics As part of the Mormon scheme of affairs, the com- munity would serve as the hub of social life. Most of the Mormon communities were planned and laid out in their formative years,56 exhibiting the rational and prac- tical attitude of the Mormon ethic. While community life was paramount, it was to operate within a set of agrarian values, largely as enunciated by Jeffersonian-Jacksonian philosophy. This should not be thought of in terms of extreme individualism. Cooperation is the most distin- guishing characteristic of Mormon community life, and in this regard Thomas O'Dea writes: Cooperaton is still the expression of group soli- darity; yet while it is an integral part of the ethic of mastery for the individual - advancing him along the path of eternal progression and relating him to fellow- ship in his community - for the Mormon group as a whole cooperation has been adjusted to the expecta- tion of the Gentile community while preserving a de- gree of exclusiveness and peculiarity. This complex of cooperation and mastery is part of a living tradition and may yet demonstrate in the face of future prob- 54. One of the most astute political observers in Utah, Tom Mc- Coy, Executive Director of the Utah Municipal League (in a personal letter to Garth N. Jones, October 10, 1962), writes as follows about this point: ". . . . Utah is not what you can call a strong supporter of the City Manager form of government. My personal opinion is that the predominant church here uses the committee-type program in the structure of its makeup, which structure is bred into the people who live in the State. . . The first city manager of Provo, E. Earl Udali (in a personal letter of April 18, 1962), commented upon a speech that Jones delivered upon the subject of the abandonment of the council-manager system by Provo City, and in that letter said almost the same thing as McCoy. 55. See Task Force Report on Federal Personnel , prepared for the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Gov- ernment, Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., 1949, 82. 56. In this regard, Utah is unique among most of the states of the Union. While much of this practice in recent years has tended to break down, the early endeavor certainly provided a good foundation for absorbing much of its recent urban sprawl. For some recent discussion here, see M. Walker Wallace, "Planning in Utah," Local Government Survey Commission, Salt Lake City, 1956, dittoed. For an excellent treatment of the formative period, see Lowry Nelson, The Mormon Village : A Pattern and Technique of Land Settlement, University of Utah Press, Salt Lake City, 1952. lems the institution inventiveness that it has dis- played in the past.57 The word "mastery" indicates much of Utah com- munity life. Even the smaller communities show a tre- mendous amount of social action at work, a beehive of activity. The propensity to join organizations, in spite of the tremendous demands of the church, seems to be just as high in Utah communities as elsewhere. Maybe this is to be expected because the Utahan is reared from childhood in strong organizational settings.58 On the other hand, we should not overlook one signi- ficant feature of the Utahan's organization, i.e., paternal- ism - or, if you wish to term it, an atmosphere of brother- hood. In no sense does it reach the highly developed ruthlessness that typifies many organizations. Competi- tion is found, but of a highly structured nature. Con- structive conflict is bred into the organizational system, and, as noted several times before, the participants are guaranteed a strong voice in the affairs of the day. Thus, the weak as well as the strong are placed side-by-side, and certainly there is built into the organization the idea of "thy brother's keeper." Technological efficiency will be sacrificed for certain social amenities and amities.59 How does all of this tie into the form of municipal government best suited for a community? This is diffi- cult to determine. It is probably upon these grounds - more than anything else - that political scientists in recent years have neglected to do any solid empirical re- search.60 One thing, however, appears evident, as far as the Utah situation is concerned. The dynamic social en- vironment dictates that municipal leadership be skilled in resolving highly competitive goal-minded groups for the general welfare of the community. This means effec- tive political leadership. General Conclusions Mormonism is still the dominate influence in the socio- culture of Utah. A strong tendency prevails for the non- Mormon elements to emulate the primary organizational features of Mormon social life. In addition, Mormonism has displayed in the past unusual abilities to adapt and/or resolve strains and conflicts. Its past flexibilities and 57. The Mormons , 1957, 221. 58. For an interesting, short description of one Utah community, read Banfield, op. cit., Chapter One. 59. In short, municipal government becomes a personal affair, where meetings are opened and closed with prayer, and deference is given to religious status and norms such as public officials being addressed as Bishop "so and so" or Brother and Sister "so and so." All of this is done in an unconscious manner, almost second nature. 60. One excellent article dealing exactly with the subject at hand is by John H. Kessel: "Government Structure and Political En- vironment," American Political Science Review, LVI (September, 1962), 615-20. For another perspective, see E. L. Sherbanon, "Class, Participation, and the Council-Manager Plan," Public Administra- tion Review, XXI (Summer, 1961), 131-35.</page><page sequence="13">2J2 HUMAN ORGANIZATION viabilities augur well for the future. In short, the socio- cultural mold, embodying much of the American promise, should dominate the shape and practices of Utah munici- pal government in the future.61 On the other hand, the threat of social cleavages pre- vails. This has already emerged in several Utah com- munities, and partakes of a nature not unlike those social cleavages found in the northeastern seaboard cities during the early 1900's. Can the Mormon ethic, consciously or unconsciously, absorb these divergent value systems? Whatever may be the outcome, the council-manager system under the immediate set of political circumstances in these cities is placed in even a more untenable political environment.62 Under the present set of tenets pertaining to council- manager government (and, again, let it be pointed out that we do not have sufficient evidence to verify them), the system has more incongruent than congruent features in reference to the political ethos of Utah. As a lower- order social system, either it will have to make major modifications or it will not become a significant part of the Utah local government scene. Several reasons should be noted as to why this conclusion is reached. The Utahan is truly a political animal. Local govern- ment is a personal matter in which he participates and demands response.63 He does not tolerate the so-called expert. This does not mean that he is anti-intellectual; quite to the contrary. In many cases, he may be just as well prepared and knowledgeable as the city manager.64 His religious background enhances his lack of respect for 61. This will be the case especially if the Church leadership is able to resolve, in a constructive social way, differences that may develop between the gentile and the Mormon communities. In re- cent years, under the benign leadership of the President of the Mormon Church, David O. McKay, relations between the two communities have been exceeding cordial. This was exemplified at a testimonial banquet given in December, 1962, honoring Presi- dent McKay, by nearly 500 business and civic leaders, who repre- sented nearly all of the religious elements in Utah. For details, see "The Ninth Prophet," Time , LXXX (December 21, 1962), 537. 62. This aspect is discussed in an excellent manner by Edward C. Banfield and James O. Wilson, City Politics , Harvard Uni- versity Press and M.I.T. Press, Cambridge, 1963, particularly 40-41. Three Utah cities should particularly be singled out where social cleavages, consciously and unconsciously, have emerged to such an extent that the council-manager system has experienced difficulties and in one case was instrumental in abandonment of the system. These cities are Price (abandoned in 1958), Ogden, and Tooele. In all three cities there are large non-Mormon populations. This situation constitutes another facet which needs to be investigated. 63. In a personal interview with the city commissioners of Provo, on September 5, 1962, they stated that one of the primary com- plaints against the council-manager system in Provo was the fact that council meetings were held only once a week. They hold meet- ings four times a week and there is always business to transmit (even on Christmas Eve!). Average attendance is 20-30 persons per meeting. 64. The Provo case is a good illustration. The present mayor and two commissioners have all had long and successful careers in business, government, and politics. All three are college graduates, two with graduate degrees. Each person's education and ex- perience was equal to or better than that of the two preceding city managers. a so-called "professional" manager. He places great faith in the democratic processes and in the inherent good of man. This is no place for Plato's philosopher-administra- tor. Competent people gravitate to municipal positions- those who are not only good politicians but also good administrators. The Utahan is motivated by accomplish- ment, and therefore thinks more in terms of social pres- tige and status than in terms of political spoils. Because of his predilection toward cooperative and democratic behavior, the Utahan prefers to work through committee-type government. Thus, the weak mayor or commission form of government is best suited to his temperament. The organizational weakness of these forms of municipal government is strengthened because he is part of a larger and more formal organizational system, the Mormon Churchģ What he cannot accomplish through the formal mechanism of the municipal government, he accomplishes through his church organization. Under this social system, outside professional managers - even if they are Mormons - are at a distinct disadvan- tage. Their activities are confined largely to that of being technicians and supervisors. Higher forms of political- administrative activity rest elsewhere. If these observations are correct, then council-manager government as outlined would certainly have a difficult time in the Utah environment - difficulties which to date the system certainly has experienced. However, much of Utah, like most of the nation, is caught in a swirl of urbanism. This situation demands effective and respon- sible professional - particularly urban type - administra- tors. How can such persons be incorporated within the political ethos of Utah? If continued local progress is to be assured, then there certainly also must be some sub- stantial changes in the municipal government of the state. But this constitutes another subject.65 Again, it should be stated that much of what is written here should be regarded as tentative and suggestive. Considerable empirical research is necessary before any hard conclusions can be drawn. The three social systems with which we are dealing have certainly been flexible and adaptable over the years. City managers have become true professionals which is evidenced in the broad geo- graphical area that managers range in their professional careers. The profession has surely become a coast-to- coast, border-to-border affair. Council-manager government can equally point to its successes, even to a greater extent than the profession of city managers. There are many examples of successful council-manager government which are content to operate with local managers who are at best semi-professionals. In such cases, the central tenet of a manager responsible for administration has been accepted, but the idea of a well-prepared professional- particularly one recruited 65.

It is in the area of regional socioculture and form of municipal government that we know almost nothing. A few exploratory studies, largely by sociologists, have been and/or are now being made on community life. These, to date, have been insightful and very revealing as to the conduct of local government. But is what takes place in Florida, Michigan, Kansas, or Utah sufficient evidence from which to draw conclusions as to the total situation in the United States? If an affirmative answer is given, one certainly is walking on thin ice!</page></plain_text>
