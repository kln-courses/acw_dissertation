<plain_text><page sequence="1">Carol Radcliffe Bolon, Forms of the Goddes Lajj? Gauri in Indian Art (Monographs on the Fine Arts sponsored by College Art Association, XLIX), The Pennsylvania State University Press, University Park, Pennsylvania 1992, xiv-91 pp., 130 figs, in 70 unnumbered plates. The 'shameless woman' often compared to far-away iconographic conceptions such as the Roman Baubo, is a fairly widespread type of image in India, which does not find an adequate and clearly defined place in the hierarchy of Hindu gods. Carol Radcliffe Bolon, Assistant Curator of South and Southeast Asian Art at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery and the Freer Gallery of Art in Washington, has chosen the name Lajj? Gauri out of a large number of names designating the same 'shameless' goddess in the various Indian languages. She describes this type of icon carefully and rightly emphasizes some particular traits, such as its variants, its connection with Saiva (or other) cult places, and its distribution throughout India. She ultimately discusses at length the meanings which are possibly conveyed by the icon in its various forms. An important assumption is made at the very beginning, in the description of the goddess who 'is almost always made to lie on her back, supine': 'The toes of the recumbent figure', Bolon writes, 'are tensely splayed as if she is in the act of giving birth, yet there is no indication of pregnancy. Some scholars have concluded, however, that [...] the pose indicates sexual receptiveness. Never? theless, it should be noted that, although some do give birth miraculously, Indian goddesses are never pregnant in imagery or myth. The pose of Lajj? Gauri is ambiguous, but probably intentionally so since the pose of sexual receptivity and the pose of giving birth are the same. The human form and the intercourse/birth pose are used as a metaphor for creation. In turn human 426</page><page sequence="2">parturition is used in this image as a metaphor for divine creation' (p. 5). I wonder whether it is correct to speak of 'metaphors' in a context where one would rather expect to find symbols, but the passage quoted sounds quite stimulating if not entirely convincing. The book is very neatly constructed ? a pithy Introduction (including a section dealing with previous studies on Lajj? Gauri, outstanding among them being those by S. Kramrisch 1956, H. D. Sankalia 1960, J.N. Tiwari 1971, 1985, and R.C. Dhere 1978) is followed by four chapters, I. Forms, II. Lajj? Gauri in Multifigured Plaques, III. Related Forms, IV. Names, and a Conclusion. In Chapter I, the author describes the various specimens and distributes them in four groups ? Form I, Utt?napad pot; Form II, Lotus-headed without arms; Form III, Lotus-headed with arms; Form IV, Anthropomorphic. The very order in which these categories are listed reflects the postulate that they are to be conceptualized 'as progressing from a minimally anthropomorphic form toward a completely anthropomorphic goddess' (p. 11). In this Bolon agrees with the typology proposed by F.H.P.M. Janssen, 'On the Origin and Development of the So-Called Lajj? Gauri', in A.J. Gail &amp; G.J.R. Mevissen, eds., South Asian Archaeology 1991, Stuttgart 1993, pp. 457-72. The neat map reproduced on p. xiv actually gives us an idea of the distribution of Lajj? Gauri images over the Indian Subcontinent ? one immediately sees that the Indus-Ganges regions (with the exception of a considerable number of specimens from the Bhita, Jhusi and Kausambi area) and the extreme South have yielded almost no Lajj? Gauri, while the greatest concentrations are found in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka. It is also to be stressed that the various Forms are unevenly distributed ? e.g., Gujarat (and Rajasthan) knows only Form IV, while Form II is only known from Kausambi, Sanchi, and Maharashtra (Paunar-Mahurjhari area, Alapur, Ter), and the greatest concentration of Form I is to be found at Ter, while Form III is more evenly spread throughout the area, though not in Gujarat (nor Rajasthan). As to the chronology, it is clear that the various Forms overlap one another. The author tries to substantiate her own chronology by resorting to the postulate of a progression 'from a minimally anthropomorphic form toward a completely anthropomorphic goddess'. She writes, 'Form I was the major early type of Lajj? Gauri popular in the south in the third and fourth centuries and was not made thereafter nor was it made elsewhere. Forms II and III seem to have succeeded it, but the lotus flower "head" they include, must be understood partially in reference to the pot bearing a lotus flower of Form I which symbolizes abundance of life. Although the torso of Forms II and III is no longer a pot but a human torso, the lotus culmination is retained with the same meaning as in Form F. Form II does not seem to be earlier than the 4th century and most of the images belonging to this category are not later than the 6th century; Form III appears to be later, as most of these lotus-headed figures with arms are to be dated between the 7th and the 9th centuries, except the specimen from Nagarjunakonda of the early 4th century which is cautiously attributed by Bolon to Form III because of the presence of a channavira (a piece of jewellery), though most of the upper part of the figure including the arms (if there were arms) is lost. Form IV is attributable, in the author's opinion, to the 6th to 7th century, which seems to contradict the succession from a minimally anthropomorphic to a fully anthropomorphic form, but it must be borne in mind that, as we have seen, Form IV is distributed over a comparatively restricted area, i.e. Gujarat (and Rajasthan), besides few sites in Uttar Pradesh (Mathura), Maharashtra (Ellora, Elephanta), and northern Karnataka. In any case, local traditions seem to have played a role of great importance. On the whole, the chronology and classifi? cation of images suggested by Bolon appears to be quite reasonable. This book is the largest corpus of Lajj? Gauri images collected so far ? by itself a great contribution to our studies, for which we must be grateful to the author. It is also a well documented attempt at providing an iconological explanation of Lajj? Gauri in her numerous variants. The author avails herself of the contributions made by earlier scholars, not only those we have referred to above, but also those who have dealt 427</page><page sequence="3">with the symbolism of the lotus, namely A.K. Coomaraswamy (1928-31), F.D.K. Bosch (1960), A. Rosu (1966), and G. Liebert (1976). Bolon rightly remarks that 'an appreciation of the symbolism accrued to this flower [...] is essential to an understading of Lajj? Gauri's nature'. It is surprising ? she adds ? that 'a satisfying essay on this subject does not exist' (p. 51). This is true, but I would like to point out that the essay by S. Morenz and J. Schubert, Der Gott auf der Blume: Eine ?gyptische Kosmogonie und ihre weltweite Bildwirkung, Ascona 1954, has been perhaps unjustifiably ignored by Bolon. The interpretation suggested by Bolon is substantially related to the idea of fertility and fecundity, which prevails through the analogical process of the 'primitive' human mind in its approach to nature as a system of symbols. On the other hand, the development from semi-aniconic to fully anthropomorphic is convincingly explained by hypothesizing a process of 'Brahminization'. A very thought-provoking section of Chapter III is the one dealing with the srwatsa, though Bolon goes perhaps too far in suggesting similarities between vegetal decoration and srivatsa, e.g. in the case of a medallion from the Bharhut st?pa (fig. 122). Nevertheless, the comparisons she suggests are extremely useful and in the end suggest that there was a continuous interchange of vegetal and human forms in various traditional Indian symbols or mangalas. Perhaps Bolon might have taken into consideration the possibility that Lajj? Gauri is in some way connected with the nandipada as well, independently or not of the srivatsa. The reviewer has only to point out a surprising oversight which nevertheless does not affect any conclusion ? the slab from Kenasapalli (Andhra Pradesh) decorated with a pool of lotuses (fig. 121; in my opinion a dedicatory stele, even if re-used for paving purposes, rather than a 'shrine doorstep', p. 55), is certainly not to be dated 3rd century A.D. 'by the paleography of its inscription', but 1st century B.C., on the grounds of both style and paleography, as it was rightly suggested by Vidya Dehejia ('Early Activity at Amaravati', AAA, XXIII, 1969-70, pp. 41-54) ? the date 3rd century A.D. is referred to by Dehejia (p. 48) for the enlargement of the st?pa at Kesanapalli, not for the slab under discussion. Bolon's book is magnificently illustrated and enriched by a Glossary (pp. 77-80), a Select Bibliography (pp. 81-86), and an Index (pp. 87-89). Out of the 130 figures, 109 reproduce images of the goddess, the others contain comparative material. This is the kind of book we would like to see published also on other subjects, thus covering the extremely rich field of Indian religious symbolism. Maurizio Taddei</page></plain_text>
