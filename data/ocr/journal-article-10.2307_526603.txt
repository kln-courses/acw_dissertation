<plain_text><page sequence="1">Amber Amulets. Martin Henig writes: Following the publication of two amber objects, a finger-ring and a knife-handle, in recent volumes of Britannia, two amuletic pendants carved in the same material have been brought to my attention.77 Both were found in graves. I. From the Roman cemetery on Fordington Hill, Dorchester, Dorset. The amulet hangs on a necklace composed of beads made of glass, bone and pearls (seed and blister). It was associated with a female inhumation, not directly dated but a coin of Constantine came from another grave and a date of c. 300 is probable.78 The amulet (FIG. 3) which is 17 mm in height is roughly bottle-shaped with a piercing through the 'neck'. Others of similar type are recorded on necklaces found at Cologne. As such amulets are found in the Baltic region they are probably not to be regarded as variants on the Etruscan and early Roman bulla- and alabastra-shaped amulets from Italy such as those from Armento now in the British Museum.79 2. From the earlier of two cemeteries on the Butt Road site, Colchester, Essex. The amber amulet was found with amulets of other materials: a canine tooth of a dog; a copper-alloy phallus with lunula; a small copper-alloy bell; an as of Hadrian in a silver mount, the reverse showing the emperor FIG. 3.

It is pierced for suspension at the temples, below a remarkable ridged coiffure. This was at first thought to be the highly banked hair-style characteristic of Flavian women, but closer inspection of the piece suggests that the fashion is an African one, common to men and women. The receding brow and thick lips are also negroid. The slit eyes and pointed ears are reminiscent of the physiognomy of those deni- zens of the wild, the satyrs, and the long nose is perhaps phallic, in which case the bust is presumably male. Comparison may be made with two amber negro heads set in gold ear-rings found in an early Roman tomb (first century B.C. - first century A.D.) at Bettona in Umbria.82 The form of our amulet is represented by the pierced anthropomorphic and zoomorphic pierced pendants from a grave at Voghenza, where the subjects are standing human figures, doves, hares, dolphins, fruit and a head of Atys.83 FIG. 4. Amber Amulet from Colchester. Scale 2 : I. (Colchester Archaeological Trust Ltd.) Amber did not enter the Empire in any quantity in the third and fourth centuries A.D. and it is prob- able that both pieces are heirlooms dating to the early Empire. Little can be said of the Dorchester amulet, but to its owner it might have been regarded as portraying a fruit, such as is commonly figured in amber, and thus have indicated a desire for fertility.84 The Colchester amulet also has a fertility aspect, the Ethiopian or pygmy representing the teeming wealth and fecundity of Africa. The strange appearance of the facial features, especially the long nose, might be apotropaic. The phallus was supposed to be a powerful protection against the Evil Eye; thus a relief from Leptis Magna shows a centaur with a greatly enlarged genital-phallus and another phallus in place of a nose, attacking the Eye with a trident.85 Graffiti on potsherds from London and Caerleon 80 The coins were identified by Richard Reece, F.S.A. 81 1 am grateful to Nina Crummy and Carl Crossan of Colchester Archaeological Trust Ltd. for this informa- tion.

Tintinnabula, incorporating phalli and bells, were common in Roman times.88 The Colchester amulet must have been made in an Aquileia workshop for Aquileia was the centre for high quality cutting of amber (and other precious stones) in Imperial times; although the Dorchester piece may likewise have been imported from the South, its unromanized appearance suggests an alternative possibility that it came ready-made from the Baltic region, perhaps via the market of Cologne.
