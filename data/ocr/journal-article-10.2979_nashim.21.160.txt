<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> HOLINESS STREAMS TOWARD THE FUTURE:  SEXUALITY IN RAV KOOK’S THOUGHT Hanoch Ben-Pazi The philosophy of Rabbi Avraham Yitzḥak Hakohen Kook points toward  the unity of all thought and ascribes divine meaning to every part of the  universe in its totality. This study will present the meaning of Eros and  male sexuality in R. Kook’s philosophy, emphasizing the integration of  personality motivated by erotic desire. R. Kook described the individual’s  sexual impulse as being derived from the great flow of the river of life that  streams at the heart of humanity. By adopting psychological insights into  culture and sexuality, R. Kook changes the religious status of Eros from  a force to be reined in to one that can fuel spiritual renovation. Introduction I will tell you, sir, a most important principle: The most enlightening outlook on the  subject of beliefs and views, as with all lofty matters, involves leaving the narrow  sphere where one finds conflicting opinions that are hostile towards each other or  completely negate each other, and to reach the lofty peak from which the roots of  all opinions can be seen. For all opinions rise to one place, and are differentiated  only due to different conditions of ways of life and the states of souls.1 The philosophy of Rabbi Avraham Yitzḥak Hakohen Kook2 directs us toward the unity  of all thought and ascribes divine meaning to every part of the universe in its totality.3  According to R. Kook, events are evolving toward a world of completeness, which  will make manifest the godliness of reality in all its aspects.4 R. Kook sees religious  significance in the development of modern science in the nineteenth and twentieth  centuries,5 since their direction appeared to him to be toward a unitary explanation for  disparate phenomena.6 As he wrote, “supreme improvement of the revelations of the  divine presence . . . by means of the widening of social relations and the growth of the  sciences, have done much to refine the human spirit” (Shemonah kevatzim [henceforth:  SK], I, 109, pp. 31–32 = Orot hakodesh [henceforth: OH], II, p. 545).7 Sociologists,  he saw, were looking to find the common structures of different human societies. The  160  NASHIM: A Journal of Jewish Women’s Studies and Gender Issues. © 2011 </page> <page sequence="2"> Sexuality in Rav Kook’s Thought theory of evolution, taking a unitary view of the history of a variety of living things,  also exemplified the complicated and difficult discovery of oneness. For R. Kook, the  new science must be seen as the opening of human consciousness toward the totality  and oneness of reality.8 This article explores the meaning of sexuality in R. Kook’s philosophy, emphasiz- ing the integration of personality motivated by erotic desire. It is important to note at  the outset that R. Kook looks at the meaning of sexuality from a male point of view,  and the sexuality he is addressing is male sexuality. At the same time, his broader  thinking about the divine aspect of Eros and its significance is beyond gender distinc- tions. With his understanding of new scientific explanations of culture and sexuality,9  R. Kook changes the religious status of Eros from a force to be reined in to one that  can fuel spiritual renewal.10 Sexuality and the Sexual Impulse According to R. Kook, man is looking to harmonize his personality, in all its aspects  and its separate parts. But the structure of personality makes this difficult, because  man has a revealed side and a concealed side.11 The first, exposed side can be expressed  verbally.12 The second, invisible side is hidden even from oneself, but one can never- theless intentionally affect it.13 As each person searches for his deep essence, for his  selfhood—R. Kook speaks in terms of the self in exile—he has to be connected to his  human drives. That is because the hidden side of the human being, so deep that is it  is unknown to consciousness, is the source of the impulses and life drive. Therefore,  how one relates to his selfhood passes through openness to one’s impulses.14 R. Kook identifies a unitary element on which all of one’s various inclinations and  impulses are based: the human sexual tendency. The sexual tendency is the basis of all  one’s drives, because it is connected to the great movement of life: “the enhancement  of the world through the continuity of all generations” (ibid.). The individual’s impulse  derives from the great flow of the river of life that streams at the heart of humanity.15  This flow of life moves from each generation to the next, from one person to another,  beyond the individual’s force and flow. It is the many details and individuals, the many  different kinds of life that together create the great flow and ever-increasing stream  of life, which is greater than one can understand and imagine, because it draws man  beyond himself. Its direction is toward the infinite, while concern for one’s own indi- viduality is limited and finite. The impulse that comes from the flow of life moves  toward the living future, without limits and even beyond death itself: “the eternal,  endless aspect hidden within man’s essence” (SK, III, 89, p. 392 = OH, III, p. 296).16 Everyone can feel the movement of the great flow of life, since it is greater than  oneself and activates the individual. But the uniqueness of the sexual desire is that  man perceives it as his own will, his own impulse. To understand its power, however,  one has to know that this desire is part of a great transcendence of any limits or laws,  and even of death:17 161 </page> <page sequence="3"> Hanoch Ben-Pazi The profound rectification of one’s misspent sexuality is the sanctification of one’s  will and its clear illumination, until the light of holiness will stream through even  your strongest physical drive. That drive is rooted in holiness that is incredibly  strong, because it contains the expression of life: the sexual drive. The light of holi- ness will stream within it to such a degree that its holy aspect will rule your life  and direct its action and expression. Then sexuality’s secular aspect, and certainly  its unclean aspect, will be totally nullified before its holy aspect. Then, in truth, the  plague will not enter your tent [cf. Ps. 91:10]; you shall be righteous and guarded  from stumbling. (SK, I, 356, p. 105 = OH, III, p. 298) The sexual impulse [yitzra de‘arayot] can envelop18 a person more deeply than  the root of his life-connection itself, since it is anchored in the tendency of all  generations toward living continuity. (SK, I, 357, p. 106 = OH, III, p. 298) The sexual impulse is the evolutionary aspect of being, of the fullness of being— havaya.19 R. Kook uses the rabbinic term ‘arayot, which literally means “genitalia,”  but in this context it refers to the laws concerning forbidden sexual relations—gilui  ‘arayot, literally the revealing or exposing of the forbidden genitalia. R. Kook’s use  of this term here implies that he sees a deeper positive impulse within the forbidden  act: One’s will has directed him to breach the taboo and to reveal what is prohibited to  reveal. The sexual impulse does not recognize the limits of permitted and forbidden,  since its power, coming as it does from the great movement of life, is beyond limits.20  R. Kook does not see it as a divine temptation that God has set before His believers,  nor as a punishment for original sin. For him, this impulse is vital to human contact  with the very flow of life, to one’s deep connection with infinity. The sexual impulse is commonly regarded as man’s will toward his own pleasure  or egotistical expression. But, according to R. Kook, it is entirely non-egotistical,  since it is the individual’s response to a general wish.21 Therefore, man is ready even  to lose himself for the sexual desire and in the sexual flow. Man is ready to die for it,  should his death serve to preserve the great movement of life. According to R. Kook,  sexual desire is not for pleasure; it is “the tendency of all generations toward living  continuity” (SK, I, 357, p. 106 = OH, III, p. 298). The kabbalistic and hasidic origins of R. Kook’s attribution of such major signifi- cance to sexual desires and acts are evident.22 Kabbalists interpret the divinity as a  dynamic system of ten sefirot whose activities are symbolized by sexual acts. The  ninth sefirah is described as the foundation of the world (tzadik yesod ‘olam), and  its symbol is the male sexual organ.23 According to this theology, to be a tzadik, a  righteous man, is to observe the proper sexual relations, since doing so preserves the  sacred covenant established by his circumcision (shemirat haberit). R. Kook’s usage of  this kabbalistic terminology draws upon the writings of R. Tzadok Hakohen concern- ing shemirat haberit. The term tzadikim, says R. Tzadok, designates people who are  circumcised. The righteousness of the people Israel is connected to their sexual drive.24  162 • Nashim 21 (2011) </page> <page sequence="4"> Sexuality in Rav Kook’s Thought This background in hasidic thought provides R. Kook with religious terminology for  his philosophical theory regarding sexuality. However, R. Kook’s application of kabbalistic terminology is in a modern language  and a modern mode of thought—what he calls “the new science.”25 For R. Kook, the  sanctification of sexuality is accomplished by means of the direction of the sexual  impulse toward the flow of life into the future. Here lies the meaning of the verse  “Your people are all righteous [tzadikim]” (Isa. 61:21): The sexual drive streams into the future, to the perfection of life that time will  bring: the life of the world-to-come within this world. That future life is filled with  complete beauty and pleasure. Thus, great is the yearning and the strength of desire  of the sexual drive, which is all-encompassing; only upon this drive does directed  holiness rest its light. The pure soul leads the sexual drive to its goal within the  boundary of Torah, wisdom, rectitude and modesty: the sources of righteousness.  “Whoever guards the covenant is called righteous.” The basis of the holiness of  Israel is tied to the world of the future. A holy spirit continuously embraces the  entirety of the nation and its individuals. “Your people are all righteous.” (SK, I,  456, pp. 126–127 = OH, IIII, p. 296) The kabbalistic sexual imagery of R. Kook’s description is daring. It implies that  to be the people Israel is to grant sacred significance to sexual desires. Directed sanc- tity—the sort that has an effect in the world—is inspired by the sexual inclination,  and only through it. Jewish thinking about directional sanctity employs the language  of ‘olam haba, “the world to come.” The way to the world to come passes through  the sexual inclination, since its meaning is to advance the world to come inside this  world, our world (ibid.). Transformed Attitudes toward Sexuality R. Kook describes culture and religion as constructed upon the limits and restrictions  they must set on primal and primitive desires: “In the early days, humanity’s general  intellectual ability was less fully developed, and its desire, too, was more barbaric”  (SK, I, 109, pp. 31–32 = OH, II, p. 545). R. Kook justifies the classic religious attitude toward sexuality, which imposed  limits on desire. In his view, though, human evolution has advanced and directed  human beings to a new way of relating to sexuality. Until now, cultural progress has  been established by limiting sexuality. The next step has to be made by changing  human attitudes in the direction of freedom and of indulging this inclination. To estab- lish an advanced culture, the previous approach must be turned on its head, moving  from limitation to liberation: 163 </page> <page sequence="5"> Hanoch Ben-Pazi The enhancement of the world through the continuity of all generations, by means  of the supreme improvement of the revelations of the divine presence in Israel  and by means of the trials of the times, the widening of social relations and the  growth of the sciences, have done much to refine the human spirit, so that even  if its purification remains incomplete, a large part of humankind’s thoughts and  the aspirations of its natural will are directed from within themselves toward the  divine good. Corresponding to the part that has already been refined, liberalism  must be disseminated and anarchy capture territory. And when tradition and reli- gion arrive, even in their purest form, to conquer the portion that has already been  refined, they will not succeed. (SK, I, 109, pp. 31–32 = OH, II, p. 545) The mystical sources of R. Kook’s theory help him to integrate and adopt scientific  explanations and psychological theories. In the early days, there was importance to  limiting impulses in order to create human culture, and the religions played a large  part in this development. But these days, he thinks, it is more important to give license  to human desire, in order to express the drive of life. The direction of development  and evolution has changed, and now man and even religions have insufficient force  to restrain and reduce the sexual impulse. Now is the time to connect humanity with  its sexual tendency, and to let natural human morality direct human impulses. The  savage past manifested itself in the evil sides of the sexual inclinations, and so it was  important to struggle against human sexuality. Now, though, the deep meaning of  human development is expressed by human nature and its desires moving to a more  advanced stage (SK, I, 109, p. 32 = OH, II, p. 545). Throughout history, people have struggled against their own will in an effort to  advance their moral behavior. R. Kook taught that there are people today who “are  familiar with the past and know its glorious goodness,” and they prefer to ignore  human development and personal advancement (SK, I, 581, p. 159 = OH, II, p. 544).  They defend subjugation of the will as part of the war against human drives and  inclinations, and they fear the granting of freedom to the sexual impulse.26 R. Kook  calls it “unnecessary slavery, which is only a detriment” (‘avdut le’ein tzorekh hi akh  lemaḥsor; SK, I, 581, p. 159 = OH II, p. 544). In our time, the limiting of impulses  reduces and perhaps even prevents the internal will from moving toward the ultimate  good and toward a better future. Imposing those limits obviates the possibility of  prophecy and spiritual life. R. Kook nevertheless offers a defense of these conservative people, and in particular  of rabbis and Jewish theologians, for, as he notes, remnants of the barbarian are still  found in modern times. Sometimes, people will try to obscure these barbaric features  with a “sparkling shine” (SK, I, 109, p. 32; OH, II, p. 575). In finding the “barbaric”  hidden within what is considered “modern,” R. Kook illustrates the dilemma involved  in discussing sexuality, a dilemma that results from the complexity of modernity,  which simultaneously requires a positive, open-minded view of sexuality and defen- sive behavior against it. Limits must necessarily be imposed upon the positive “fer- ment” of the noble, life-affirming aspects of the erotic impulses, because such limits  164 • Nashim 21 (2011) </page> <page sequence="6"> Sexuality in Rav Kook’s Thought are the foundation of human culture and civilization. Just how is one to limit the  impulse that moves toward “the supernal wellspring” of life? R. Kook asks us to adopt  an open, free attitude toward the sexual inclination and simultaneously to recognize  the cultural importance of limits and the possible pathology related to sexuality. Pathological Sexuality For R. Kook there is also a pathological sexuality, and he attempts to offer a profound  understanding of its source. R. Kook’s approbative description of the sexual inclina- tion would appear to leave no room for problems and difficulties or sexual sins.27 His  portrays sexuality as so bright and positive—the living flow of every aspect of reality,  including the human being—that there should be no need of limits. What, then, is the  source of this potential pathology? R. Kook’s answer relates to death and the fear of death. Human attitudes toward  death are the basic foundation of pessimism in this world.28 The fear of death causes  the human being to block himself off from sexuality. An individual may find himself  mired in his impulses for his own pleasure. Out of the pessimism born of the fear  of death, he wants to stay in life—in the present—rather than being connected to the  living movement toward the future. According to R. Kook, it is not a simple task to  respond to Eros, in its exaltedness and holiness. One has to open himself before a flow  that goes beyond oneself and one’s own powers. The individual has the power to con- struct a dam against that flow, to prevent himself from feeling the deep movement of  living and its sexual impulses, creating a state of impermeability that is the outcome of  an inward retreat, a will to withdraw into oneself. This narcissistic impulse is the death  wish, a deep desire toward death that makes it impossible to move toward the future  and all the possible worlds. It may look like pleasure, a living drive or delight, but at  its core it is an absence of forward movement. The impulse that seems self-sufficient  and affirming of living pleasure is revealed as impermeability and inflexibility toward  the erotic and the flow of life. As much as this movement of life is great, so are its falsifications. The raging, living  flow has the power to create small, distorted lusts. The verse “In my flesh I shall see  God” (Job 19:26) teaches man, in observing his penis, to see the great meaning of divin- ity.29 Observing the male sexual organ reveals an internal sexual conflict, between the  development of foreskin, which R. Kook sees as an expression of impermeability, and its  removal by circumcision. The meaning of circumcision is to remove the obstruction and  open the person to his impulses.30 The complexity of human sexuality finds expression in  people’s ambivalent attitudes toward the foreskin. R. Kook explains this ambivalence as  a tension between the desire toward self-absorption and outward openness, a readiness  to link up with the direction of evolution and human development. Human degeneration  creates the problem of blocking; the ritual of circumcision tries to solve it.31 For R. Kook this physiological development, the growth of a foreskin, is a bodily  expression pointing toward, or even causing, a change of direction in human impulse,  165 </page> <page sequence="7"> Hanoch Ben-Pazi from a desire for life to a tendency toward death. Man is sinking in pathological sexu- ality to the point of forgetting himself. Instead of sexuality being seen as a unification  of disparate human tendencies, bringing them together, integrating them, and connect- ing the individual to the greater flow of life, it is possible to make of it something that  causes dissolution and disintegration of the self. The pathology, according to R. Kook, lies not only in uncircumcised corporeality; it  is also a spiritual impermeability of closed-heartedness and impeded speech. R. Kook  uses the term “uncircumcised” (‘arel) as does the Bible, associating it with the lips,  the heart, and the ear, whose metaphoric “foreskins” block their proper functioning.  The pathological sexual inclination may find expression in a person blocking himself  to spirituality or to any attempt at attaining an ideal, leaving him without any direc- tion or forward motion. He takes the power of the living flow and directs it toward a  closed channel. The force and living power of holiness are diverted into whirlpools  of self-engagement. This is the basis of human pessimism, a movement of death.32  According to R. Kook, this thinking is congruent with the atheistic pessimism of  Schopenhauer’s philosophy. What are the results of a sexuality that moves toward death, an impulse that is not  linked to the living flow? R. Kook sees this as “multiplying the number of miserable  beings” (SK, I, 197, pp. 137–138 = OH, III, p. 301). The pessimism stemming from  blocked sexuality increases wretchedness and misery, since it brings to the world  mortal beings,33 motivated by the power of death and their fear of it.34 This pathology  is not merely a problem of individuals; the development of a foreskin in the human  race is an effect of its pessimism. The sinking of the human spirit into sexual desire to the point of complete immer- sion, to the point of sealing off its ideal and moral nature, is the cause of the char- acteristic of having a foreskin. And this pathological status carries along with it  the adoption of the [walling-off] tendency in the form that strays from the realm of  the ideal, since, given that reality as a whole is a great evil, how can it be an ideal  to multiply the number of miserable beings? According to this, the entire [sexual]  tendency has no root in the ideal. It is only an outburst of lust that determines its  [i.e., sexuality’s] path. (SK, I, 497, pp. 137–138; OH, III, p. 301) The pessimistic tendency, combining the death wish and the power of the will to  live, is the source of all problems relating to sexuality. It is when a person finds himself  errant and straying in relation to Eros that he is susceptible to sexual transgressions— incest and other forbidden relations. R. Kook is optimistic with regard to this sexual  pathology, since the deep roots of the sexual impulse are situated in the river of life.35  The living flow that drives people and their impulses may overcome all feelings of  depression and unease—even suicidal tendencies. “The light of holiness wells up in it  so much that its holy side is the one that rules over life and continues its actions and  its presence” (SK, I, 497, pp. 137–138 = OH, III, p. 301). 166 • Nashim 21 (2011) </page> <page sequence="8"> Sexuality in Rav Kook’s Thought R. Kook emphasizes the potential of giving a unified direction to all human aspects  and impulses, of directing all one’s moves and impulses and acts to the great living  flow. A person must pave his noble way toward holiness. Searching for a way to inte- grate his entire personality, he should look within himself to his sexual impulse, and  the unity he can find there will help him recognize the unity of God: “he will sanc- tify the Holy One of Israel [by saying]: ‘The Lord is one’ ” (SK, I, 197, pp. 137–138;  OH, III, p. 301). The mighty flowing stream of life can overcome all mental blocks,  all straying and all errors concerning sexuality. This living force can breach human  impermeability. Ambivalence toward Homosexuality36 It may surprise us that, at the beginning of the twentieth century, R. Kook deals with  homosexuality and even sees it as an innate tendency. His statements against homo- sexuality are surprisingly moderate, and his request is only for “moral protestation.”  Playing on the words of a midrash, R. Kook refers to male homosexuality using the  expression “transgressions that a person grinds with his heels [dash be’akevav],”  commonly understood to refer to transgressions so marginal that one hardly gives  them a passing thought, but which the Torah nonetheless demands we take care not to  commit.37 According to his thinking, man has to direct his sexuality and not struggle  to subdue it. R. Kook himself appears to have been aware of the daring nature of the religious  thought he was advocating, which reached its pinnacle in his ambivalence toward  homosexuality. The conflict between what he perceives as the appropriate attitude in  human and scientific terms and that which he inherits from Jewish religious tradition  makes an easy solution impossible. Acceptance of modern scientific research leads  him to recognize the existence of a natural tendency toward same-sex sexual relations,  which he refers to as “an inborn tendency.” The arousal of the new science concerning the natural inclination to homosexual- ity that some men have from their conception, and on account of this, they [the  scientists] want to uproot the ethical protest against this—but the word of our God  will stand forever. (SK, VI, 97, p. 219 = OH, III, p. 298)38 R. Kook’s theology cannot leave scientific insight outside the realm of his cognition.  He seeks out the divine religious meaning of this human tendency and, it appears,  holds himself responsible for providing a response to this contradiction between nature  and halakhah.39 R. Kook’s religious response refers to BT Nedarim 50b–51a, one of the most sur- prising passages in talmudic literature in its attitude toward sexuality (see SK, VI,  97, p. 219 = OH, III, p. 298). The tractate’s main topic is vows, and it is in the context  167 </page> <page sequence="9"> Hanoch Ben-Pazi of various food-related vows that a person might take upon himself that this pas- sage makes a connection between food and sexuality. The discussion is illustrated  or developed partly by means of a story—one that appears to take itself less than  entirely seriously—about the attempts of Bar Kappara to get R. Judah the Prince  (called “Rabbi”) to smile, even though R. Judah thought that by doing so he would  bring destruction upon the world. The story, which takes place on the wedding day of  R. Simeon, R. Judah’s son, discusses the words to‘evah (“abomination,” Lev. 18:22,  20:13), tevel (“perversion,” Lev. 18:23) and zimah (“depravity,” Lev. 18:17), used in  the Torah’s list of proscribed sexual behaviors to refer, respectively, to homosexuality,  bestiality and incest. Bar Kappara asked Rabbi, “What is meant by to‘evah”?  Now, every explanation offered by Rabbi was refuted by him, so Rabbi said to  him, “Explain it yourself.”  He replied, “Let your wife come and fill me a cup.” She came and did so, upon  which he said to Rabbi, “Arise, and dance for me, that I may tell it to you. Thus  says the Divine Law, to‘evah: to‘eh atah bah [“You err with respect to her”—i.e.,  by forsaking the permitted and indulging the forbidden].”  At his second cup, he asked him, “What is meant by tevel?” He replied in the  same manner as before, [until] he remarked, “Do [something] for me, and I will tell  you.” On his complying, he said to him, “Tevel hu means ‘Is there tavlin [perfume]  in it [i.e., the animal]?’ Is intimacy therewith sweeter than all other intimacies?”  Then he further questioned, “And what is meant by zimah?”—“Do as before,  [and I will tell you].” When he did so, he said, zimah—zu mah hi [“This . . .—What  is it?”]. For our purposes, it will suffice to look at Bar Kapara’s attitude toward the various  prohibited sexual unions, an attitude that shows something bordering on the positive.  Tevel, a term of disapproval, becomes a “spice.” To‘evah becomes “you err [or: stray]  with respect to her,” an ambiguous expression that winks at the deviance ascribed to  homosexuality. If we stay with R. Kook’s formulation, then, he would like to critique homosexuality  without entirely rejecting it. He maintains the dimension of ethical protest, recogniz- ing the prohibition against male homosexual relations, but he also tries to provide an  explanation for the existence of that tendency.40 In so doing, he employs an important  ethical expression: The religious attitude demands “compassion” in accordance with  the Torah’s understanding. To achieve a fuller understanding of R. Kook’s response, we must distinguish  between the halakhic question and the theological question relating to homosexuality.  R. Kook grapples with the halakhic issue by referring to anal sex.41 His recommenda- tion to a man with a homosexual tendency is to redirect himself and his inclinations  to other forms of sexuality that join male with female. In his terms, “the Torah has  plumbed the depths of man’s mind; should he wish, let him ‘upend his table’. . . .” 168 • Nashim 21 (2011) </page> <page sequence="10"> Sexuality in Rav Kook’s Thought The theological question should be viewed from a more general perspective. It is not  the individual who establishes his own inclinations, but rather the general fl ow of life  and the state of human development. One establishes one’s own inclinations only in  the most minor way: in how he links himself to the general trend of the development  of the human race. That humankind, deaf and blind to the inclination toward eternity,  has degenerated and developed a foreskin is related to the development of various  sexual tendencies. An individual’s homosexual tendencies are part of the situation of  humankind as a whole and its pessimistic attitude toward life. Homoerotic sexuality  is a sexuality of pleasure that is based on human limitation in the face of death. This  being the case, one can only offer a moral protest against it, while accepting it as a  congenital, natural tendency. In a deep sense, the religious solution can be found, in R. Kook’s view, in the mes- sianic inclination. That tendency toward the eternal dimension of life can lead to an  optimistic sexuality; it can bring about a profound shift in humanity in general and in  the place of homosexuality in particular. This leads R. Kook to a central conclusion:  “And those who remain in Zion and those who are left in Jerusalem shall be called  holy, and he shall hate duplicity [literally: “turned-upside-downness”], but the path of  the upright is paved.” This is a sort of literary collage; phrased in terms that play on  the multiple meanings of some biblical allusions to the messianic future, it comprises  parts of three verses: “And those who remain in Zion and those who are left in Jerusalem shall be called  holy—all who are inscribed for life in Jerusalem.” (Isaiah 4:3) “To fear the LORD is to hate evil; pride, arrogance, the evil way, and duplicity in  speech [literally, “a mouth of turned-upside-downness”] I hate. (Proverbs 8:13) “The way of a lazy man is like a hedge of thorns, but the path of the upright is  paved.” (Proverbs 15:19) The sexual meaning of R. Kook’s composite sentence, based on the Zohar’s sym- bolism, draws together the various possible forms of sexual union, setting apart the  person who is directed toward the messianic future—toward Jerusalem. It is he who  will be called “holy.” Tikkun/Repair—The Spiritual Meaning of Circumcision The corrections made necessary by the above-described state of affairs are not only  corporeal—removal of the foreskin—but are also a matter of speech and dialogue. In  169 </page> <page sequence="11"> Hanoch Ben-Pazi its more profound sense, circumcision is not a discrete, one-time ritual, but a continual  effort. The spiritual work surrounding sexuality, R. Kook suggests, is accomplished  through language and speech. Basing himself on the mystical Sefer yetzirah, R. Kook  sees a parallel between the nearly homophonous terms millah (“word”) and milah  (“circumcision”):42 Ten Sephirot of nothingness43 . . . He made with him a covenant between the ten  fingers of his hands—this is the covenant of the tongue, and between the ten toes  of his feet—this is the covenant of circumcision. . . . (Sefer yetzirah 6:7) The parallel between speech and sexuality is based on an internal movement within  the human being, one that begins with the living flow, continues through the sexual  impulse to human thought, and finally finds its expression in speech. Thinking is not  exalted, not held to be more important than Eros; rather, it is the expression of Eros.  In thinking begins realization. The continuing movement is toward words and speech  by means of the mouth and tongue; it is from the general tendency—sexuality—toward  an abstract tendency—thought—and into small details that are the units of speaking.  Plotting the course can be instructive in the opposite direction—helping us move from  speech to thought and on toward erotic life, from details toward generalities. There  are two ways to open a person to his sexuality, which is the infinite dimension of his  life. The first way is based on a corporeal act, circumcision. The second way is based  on internal, mental transformation, which operates through human language: The supernal ethical gaze that flows from supernal consciousness of the divine  places its seal on the nexus where God’s will and the ultimate purpose of sexual- ity join. That seal is the eternal and infinite aspect of sexuality concealed in one’s  human character. There is no doubt that in this invaluable point, all supernal  pleasures are concealed. (SK, III, 89, p. 392 = OH, III, p. 296) Man is just one individual element of the general flow. Man’s own thoughts are just  parts of a general thought. The private sexual impulses are just part of the great  sexuality of the flow of life. In contrast to medieval Jewish philosophers, R. Kook gives preference to the sexual  inclination over thought. R. Joseph Albo would explain the philosophical way toward  perfection as follows: Their opinion is that man has no perfection qua man except after death, when the  intellect is separated from matter and corporeal things. This follows from the fact  that rational things are graded according to their degree of understanding, the one  that understands more is superior to the one that understands less. Since, therefore,  man’s superiority to animals consists in his reason, his perfection must be a degree  of excellence based upon intelligence alone.44 170 • Nashim 21 (2011) </page> <page sequence="12"> Sexuality in Rav Kook’s Thought But for R. Kook the meaning of perfection is not dependent upon man’s reason. He  can find his way toward perfection through his sexuality, which is the eternal dimen- sion of humanity. Man cannot be a pessimist if he breaches his impermeability and  all his blocked sides. To be a man without accomplishing such a breakthrough is to  live toward death and pessimism. The “true healing” for the pessimistic mode and  for humanity’s subjugation to death is hidden in the “Treasure of Life” (otzar ḥayim),  which is called nishmata de’Oraita, “the soul of the Torah” (SK, I, 486, p. 333 = OH,  II, p. 381). Man has to separate himself from the unseen membrane that wraps him into a closed  world. He must exit from his private realm into the whole, which bears the sign of  eternity. He can do that by establishing new relations with other people, with all of  love’s phenomena. To open oneself toward love is to open oneself toward pure desire,  shared by the whole universe. According to R. Kook, this is the secret of circumcision  and spiritual circumcision: The secret of the removal of the foreskin is the raising of the desire for life to the  highest level, which is directive, until all the impulse to procreate and all the spiri- tual offshoots associated with it, the entire realm of romance with all its branches,  are, all of them, holy offshoots of the powerful push toward life, until it is made  into reality out of its absence, with supernal strength and pure desire that places the  stamp of love’s pleasure on the entire universe.” (SK, I, 486, p. 334 = OH, II, p. 383) One has to acquire a spiritual outlook, or, as R. Kook calls it, “a supreme moral view,”  to understand that acts relating to the regulation of sexuality, such as circumcision, are  actually aimed toward openness and not against corporeal pleasure. These acts point  man beyond his closed mind toward the holy tendency of life: To turn sexuality and its essential offshoots to the holy goal of life. That strategy is  the cornerstone of all ethical values that form the basis of the world of humanity,  both internal and external. (SK, III, 89, p. 392 = OH, III, p. 296) Abstaining from sexuality is a dark path, but the deep meaning of sexual modesty,  by contrast, is the freedom of the flow of life. Religious behavior might seem to point  to seclusion and withdrawal into oneself, to darkness and religious asceticism, but  that is because of one’s own vulgar, rude thoughts. The righteous person, with his  honest gaze, can see that sexual pleasure brings him into relation with the divine  consciousness, since it is the path of life’s movement. Days will come when the general culture will gaze with exalted appreciation at  the divine glory pervading those thoughts that now appear benighted to those who  are sexually gross, who have an unrefined consciousness, who remain outside the  camp of Israel. 171 </page> <page sequence="13"> Hanoch Ben-Pazi  Those thoughts are connected, in the mystic aspect of ethics, to sexual rectifica- tion, to all the fast-day prayers and outcries of those who have strayed. “Light is  sown for the tzadik [‘righteous person’—and a kabbalistic epithet for the penis],  and for those who have an honest heart, joy” [Ps. 97:11]. (SK, III, 89, p. 392 = OH,  III, p. 297) R. Kook interprets the verse from Psalms45 as referring to the joy of connection with  the flow of life. The openness of the tzadik is an optimistic way of life, since it releases  man from his blocked self. Let us conclude with another passage from R. Kook’s writings: To the extent that noble spiritual thought in its purity appears and casts its light on  man’s faculty of speech, the foundational “tree of life” (‘etz ḥayim) that is within  his sexuality will be firmly established upon the most exalted, powerful spiritual  basis in the highest sanctity, and the inner light of life in all its strength will shine  through all speech and come to a conclusion, and upon you and all your paths will  be a brilliant light. (SK, III, 90, p. 392 = OH, III, p. 296) The “tree of life”46 here symbolizes both the divine revelation of the flow of life  and the male sexual organ. When a person wants to change his attitude toward his  sexuality, he must work on his thought and his speech. It is a question not of specific  behaviors, but of a general way of life. Behaviorism cannot help man in this work  of changing himself, since in his sexuality one is connected to a divine flow that  is beyond his powers. It is not a matter simply of proclaiming some activity to be  “forbidden” or “allowed.” Man has to connect himself to the roots of his impulses. The above passage alludes to the verse: “You will decree (vatigzar) and it will be  fulfilled [literally, ‘it will stand up for you’], and light will shine upon your paths”  (Job 22:28). This verse is traditionally interpreted as being about the religious rela- tions between God and His followers. If the righteous person requests something,  God accedes to his request. However, the verb gazar has a few meanings: in religious  or judicial language it means “to sentence or issue judgment,” but in common usage  its meaning is “to cut.” According to R. Kook, the cut of circumcision expresses not  only a decree or sentence, but an opening to allow a great light to shine on the path  of life. Opening toward sexuality brings openness toward the great flow of life and  its holiness. According to R. Kook, we are living in a period of transition. We must open our- selves toward our impulses. We must attune ourselves to the great movement of life  that drives our impulses and our will. 172 • Nashim 21 (2011) </page> <page sequence="14"> Sexuality in Rav Kook’s Thought Notes: 1. See R.

This study accepts  the view that R. Kook’s thought is founded on a Hegelian approach—a view that has,  of course, been debated both among his followers and among scholars.

On the meaning of evolution in R. Kook’s thought see Avraham Yitzḥak Hakohen Kook,  Orot hakodesh, ed. David Hakohen–Nazir (Hebrew; Jerusalem: Mosad Harav Kook,  1960), III, p. 537 (henceforth: OH); on the concept of development in R. Kook’s thought,  see Zvi Yaron, Philosophy of Rabbi Kook (above, note 2), pp. 95–100. 9. Freud’s research concerning sexuality may be regarded as a good example of the new sci- ence; see his books, including Beyond the Pleasure Principle (New York: Bantam, 1961);  and On Sexuality: Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality and Other Works (Harmonds- worth: Penguin Books, 1977; both translated by James Strachey). The reception of Freud  and psychoanalysis in pre-state Palestine is treated at length in Eran. J. Rolnik, Freud  in Zion: History of Psychoanalysis in Jewish Palestine/Israel 1918–1948 (Hebrew; Tel  Aviv: Am Oved, 2007). 10. Most of the passages that deal directly with sexuality are found in two notebooks, the  first and third among the printed volumes of Shemonah kevatzim (about which see below;  henceforth: SK), both of which date from R. Kook’s Jaffa period, between 1904 and 1914.  The notebooks were apparently written in tandem, with no clear indication that the first  precedes the third in chronological order.  In the passages in the first notebook, it is clear that R. Kook is taking on issues with  which he is uncomfortable dealing in plain language, because they bare the secret recesses  of the soul. In one place, he writes at length about the role of literature in these matters,  since it reveals to people “the most hidden-away of the soul’s deliberations.” This is an  important and religious function, because it is the way to reveal “the human form.” See  SK, I, 176, p. 63; and see Avinoam Rosenak, “Hidden Diaries and New Discoveries: The  Life and Thought of Rabbi A. I. Kook,” Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish  Studies, 25 (2007), pp. 111–147; Jonathan Garb, “Prophecy, Halakhah, and Antinomian- ism in Eight Files by Rabbi A. I. ha-Kohen Kook,” in Zeev Gries, Haim Kreisel and Boaz  Huss (eds.), Shefa Tal: Studies in Jewish Thought and Culture Presented to Berakhah Zak  (Beersheba: Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, 2004), pp. 267–277 (Hebrew); and idem,  “The Chosen Will Become Herds”: Studies in Twentieth-Century Kabbalah (Hebrew;  Jerusalem: Carmel Publications and the Shalom Hartman Institute, 2005). 11. The search for the hidden meaning of personality occupies R. Kook’s attention not just  as a theoretical discussion, but mostly as a search for his own self. The significance of  this search can be explained as part of his mystical spiritual work, which is emergence  from himself into himself. It can, however, also be understood in a modern context of a  search for one’s own self. On education leading to authenticity, see Avinoam Rosenak, The  Prophetic Halakhah: Rabbi A.I.H. Kook’s Philosophy of Halakhah (Hebrew; Jerusalem:  Magnes, 2007), pp. 381–384. 12. The search for esoteric and exoteric elements in social and personal reality enables  R. Kook to make his religious analysis of the divine meaning of heresy and of the  pioneering Zionist enterprise. 13. On the meaning of “self” in R. Kook’s thought, see Ish-Shalom, “The Concept of ‘Free- dom’ and the Category of ‘Self,’ ” in idem, Between Rationalism and Mysticism (above,  note 2), pp. 99–125. On R. Kook’s thought about personality, see Daniel Hamiel, “A Model  of Personality in the Teachings of Rabbi Kook” (Hebrew; Ph.D. Dissertation, The Hebrew  University of Jerusalem, 1993). 14. This discussion could also be part of the deliberation in which R. Kook was involved about  the process of redemption, given that it includes the construction of a new type of Jewish  scholar (talmid ḥakham). A central part of the training of these scholars would be their  174 • Nashim 21 (2011) </page> <page sequence="16"> Sexuality in Rav Kook’s Thought education toward a relationship with nature and the body. As R. Kook describes it, in order  to overcome heresy, one must train talmidei ḥakhamim who are healthy in body and mind  and who know how to deal with the glory of nature: “[Three things increase a man’s self- esteem:] a beautiful dwelling, a beautiful wife, and beautiful clothes” (BT Berakhot 57b). 15. One can find in these words an echo of Nietzsche’s thought, perhaps coming through the  Zionist milieu that R. Kook discovered in Palestine. The importance of Nietzschean ideas  of vitality in Berdichevsky and the mode of his acceptance of them carried with them the  baggage of Freudian language.  Also noteworthy is the acceptance of some psychoanalytic ideas regarding repression  by Leo Baeck, Ernst Simon and Hugo Bergman, prominent figures in the Jewish cultural  revival among young German Jews. They had good relations with Sigmund Siegfried  Bern feld, who served as secretary of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society; see Rolnik,  Freud in Zion (above, note 9), pp. 47–51. Perhaps no less important is the active opposi- tion of Martin Buber to Freud’s approach, which found a willing ear and sparked lively  discussion among his students. 16. See also Samuel Hugo Bergman, “On Death and Immortality,” in Gellman, Essays (above,  note 3), pp. 61–68. 17. See SK, III, 89, p. 392; VI, 82–99, pp. 214–219; OH, III, pp. 296–301. 18. The verb melapephet—“envelop”—carries a halakhic meaning as well, referring to a shift  of category from one who has simply violated a law to one who was forced to do so. See  Neria Gutel, Innovation in Tradition: The Halakhic-Philosophical Teachings of Rabbi  Kook (Hebrew; Jerusalem: Magnes, 2005), pp. 89–90 and the references there to specific  halakhic rulings. 19. This can be compared with Bergson’s attitude toward the élan vital, that which moves  life toward development and progress and makes possible a different sort of thinking and  consciousness, in the sense of a living consciousness. See Henri Bergson, L’evolution  créatrice (Paris: F. Alcan, 1907), and his Matière et mémoire: Essai sur la relation du  corps avec l’esprit (Paris: F. Alcan, 1896). The parallel is especially evident in relation  to the question of time; see idem, Time and Free Will (English transl. by F.L. Pogson;  London–New York: Swam Sonnenschein–Macmillan, 1910), pp. 140–221. 20. The thrust of divine ethics is not restrictive, but rather directs the individual to live a full  life, one “drawn from the well of life” (SK, I, 522, p. 144). 21. R. Kook published a letter known as Iggeret hatohorah that was reprinted many times—as  an introduction to R. Yehiel Michal Tukachinsky, Tohorat Yisrael (Jerusalem: Zucker- man, 1901/2, reprinted 1930), and as an introduction to Menahem M. Kasher, Hod she- bikedushah (Jerusalem: Keren Hasifrut Haḥaredit, 1934/5). Its intent was to encourage  the observance of the rabbinic laws of family purity, but the letter is of wider interest for  Jewish thought, because R. Kook attributes a redemptive significance to his efforts. He  draws a connection between immersion in a mikveh for family purity purposes and for  purification after contact with a corpse: “Guard yourselves from death’s pollution.” The  need for immersion is seen as a sanctification of life, as distancing oneself in practice from  every death-related element for the sake of continuing life. This reading by R. Kook is very  much in keeping with his philosophical conception regarding sexuality as clinging to life. 22. On mystical tradition and kabbalistic sources in R. Kook’s writings, see Avivi, “His- tory is a Divine Prescription” (above, note 4); idem, “The Sources of Orot,” Zohar:  Ketav ‘et torani, 1 (2000), pp. 93–112; Smadar Cherlow, The Tzaddiq is the Foundation  of the World: Rav Kook’s Esoteric Mission and Mystical Experience (Hebrew; Ph.D.  175 </page> <page sequence="17"> Hanoch Ben-Pazi Dissertation, Bar Ilan University, 2003); Y.L.

See Brill, Thinking God (above, note 24), pp. 180–181. There is a modest amount of pub- lished research concerning the kabbalistic sources of modern psychological theories of  sexuality and especially of psychoanalytic writings. The search for the Jewish and kabbal- istic sources of Freud’s theory is described and examined in David Bakan, Sigmund Freud  and the Jewish Mystical Tradition (Princeton: Van Nostrand, 1958). On the responses of  Max Eitingon, Otto Rank and others who identified psychoanalysis as a “Jewish science,”  and on the work of Immanuel Velikovsky, see Duane Voorhees, The “Jewish Science”  of Immanuel Velikovsky: Culture and Biography as Ideational Determinants (Ph.D.  Dissertation, Bowling Green State University, 1990). 26. It appears that the terms “freedom” and “the desire for internal freedom” in R. Kook’s  thought may be viewed in light of his conceptions of the meaning of liberalism in relation  to sexuality, the laws relating to modesty and sexuality, and the interpretation of those  laws. See Rosenak, Prophetic Halakhah (above, note 11), pp. 96–115. 27. See Brill, Thinking God (above, note 24), pp. 177–184. 28. See Tamar Ross, “Immortality, Natural Law, and the Role of Human Perception in the  Writings of Rav Kook,” in Kaplan and Shatz, Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook and Jewish  Spirituality (above, note 6), pp. 237–253. 29. R. Kook cites Job 19:26 and refers to the kabbalistic terminology on this idea: see, e.g.,  Haim Vital, Sefer Etz-ḥayim, 8c and chapters 23 and 25, on the vision of divinity through  the human body. 30.

The reason for the commandment of circumcision in R. Kook’s halakhic writings warrants  clarification. See Rosenak, Prophetic Halakhah (above, note 11), pp. 333–334; and see  also Kook, Otzerot haRaayah, IV (Hebrew; Sha’alvim: Yeshivat Sha’alvim, 1987/8), p. 37,  where circumcision is taken to be done for the sake of the existence of the Jewish nation. 32. R. Kook’s discussion of circumcision is directly connected to his recognition of the  weakening effect of dealing with death. He discusses at length the fear of death and the  importance of circumcision in the struggle against the pessimism engendered by death.  See SK, I, 481–502, pp. 132–139. 33.

Kook’s use of the phrase relies on less common meanings of the two words, with dash  referring to sexual intercourse and ‘akev to the backside. See BT Avodah zarah 18a and  Yevamot 34a; Tosefta Nidah 2:4. 38. The quotation from the sixth notebook on the rise of modern science appears in a col- lection of materials written in Switzerland in the years 1934–1936. This is a particularly  interesting passage, since R. Kook goes on to speak in personal terms about “the pure and  holy tzadik who comes from the Torah to the source of the Torah” (ibid.). 39. In “Rav Kook on Homosexuality” (above, note 36), Bezalel Naor rejects the argument  that R. Kook displayed some measure of tolerance in this regard. His own argument rests  on R. Kook’s halakhic discourse and on traditions regarding “unnatural intercourse”  going back to R. Asher ben Yehi’el (known as the Rosh; thirteenth–fourteenth century  Spain), which Naor characterizes as showing “no sympathy for homoeroticism from  that quarter” (p. 160). In Naor’s view, R. Kook recommends that homosexual tendencies  be directed into “unnatural intercourse” (bi’ah shelo kedarkah) with one’s wife: “Rav  Kook’s assumption that the husbands who requested of their wives bi’ah shelo kedar- kah were born homosexuals, is original, to the best of my knowledge.” It seems that  that R. Kook’s recognition of an innate homosexual tendency sets him apart, showing  his internalization of what he calls “modern science” and laying the foundation for an  empathetic approach. 40. An additional passage cited by Naor is taken from R. Kook’s responsa. See Avraham  Yitzḥak Hakohen Kook, Mishpat Kohen (Jerusalem, 1985), §148, p. 358. R. Kook dis- cusses the responsa of the Rosh and cultures that recognized homosexuality, such as  Muslim Spain in the Middle Ages. 177 </page> <page sequence="19"> Hanoch Ben-Pazi 41.
