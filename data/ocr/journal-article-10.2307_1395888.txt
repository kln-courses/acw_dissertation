<plain_text><page sequence="1">72 visibly pregnant: toward a placental body JaneMaree Maher abstract In recent years, feminist theorists have examined the use of visual technologies in pregnancy and argued that these technologies are reconstructing the meaning of pregnancy. The imaged body of gestation can be deployed to distinguish and separate maternal and foetal interests. Drawing on this work, 'Visibly Pregnant: Toward a placental body' argues that the use of visual technology also obfuscates that which it purports to make clear. The images produced by these technologies in particular do not locate and acknowledge the significance of the placenta as a point of connection and distinction for the gestating body. The possibilities suggested by a concentration on the placenta show how the morphology of the pregnant body itself rejects the distinction outlined in the technologically produced images of pregnancy and offers some new possibilities for thinking subjectivity. keywords pregnancy; visual technologies; placenta; feminism; subjectivity; embodiment feminist review 72 2002 95 (95-107) (i) 2002 Feminist Review. 0141-7789/02 $15 www.feminist-review.com</page><page sequence="2">Oliver Sacks, in The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat (1985), describes a psychiatric condition he calls 'visual agnosia'. This condition disturbs the frames through which we view the world around us. The man who literally mistook his wife for a hat tried to identify what he was seeing by a series of marks or characteristics, rather than through a conception of the whole object. This gave him a false understanding of what he saw. The identifying characteristics that he saw on his wife led him to mistake her for a hat. In Sack's construction of the operation of the gaze, it is clear that the visual field can become disturbed, rendering it fallible as a mode of interpretation. The characteristics identified in the field do not necessarily construct for the eye the object of the gaze. This is a useful notion to bring to conceptions of the pregnant body. Pregnancy has been transformed by the routine use of visual technologies. In the culture pervaded by Western medicine and dominated by the image, the pregnant belly is no longer opaque, but is instead an easily understood visual symbol-small baby here! In newspapers, on public transport, on placards in the abortion debate, the bump is depicted with the child inside. Images of pregnant bodies are read through these identified marks and separated sites-maternal body and foetus. In this article, I want to argue that this dependence on the marks of pregnancy made available through visual technologies allow for a reproductive form of Sack's visual agnosia. As a result of visually acquired understandings of the corporeal, we render the pregnant body and the foetal body as two. We fail to 'see' the 'embodied unity represented there' (Vasseleu, 1991: 56) and its implications and possibilities. A reconfiguration of the visual field might allow for a different view of gestation, placing the pregnant woman inside the frame, rather than locating her body as the frame for the foetal subject. This article draws on the comprehensive and persuasive work done by feminist theorists, where they have argued that the operation of visual technologies distinguishes foetal and maternal entities in the pregnant body. In consequence, the visibility of the woman in the frame has declined. As Daniels (1993) has noted, this distinction between mother and foetus has been essential for feminist reconfigurations of motherhood, but has also proved inadequate for expressing 'the relational nature of pregnancy or the deeply social nature of reproduction'. (Daniels, 1993: 5) It is with the desire to provide a material basis for that relational aspect of gestation that I turn to the particular morphology of the pregnant body, arguing that its cartography both contests and confirms the insights of visual technologies. In particular, I argue that the placenta offers, in both material and metaphorical terms, a way to begin thinking through the impasse of pregnant representation. As an organ with a clear temporal limit and a defined role, it allows for an understanding of the connection and potential for differentiation that are inherent in the embodied experience of pregnancy. Its compl icated location as the point between the foetal and maternal entities and within the pregnant body offers some guidelines for how we 96 fe m i n i st revi ew 72 2 0 0 2 visibly pregnant: toward a placental body</page><page sequence="3">might understand and reconfigure concepts of subjectivity and corporeality in pregnancy. The purpose for which I turn to the placenta is twofold. The placenta offers a direct contestation of the widely circulated images of the free-flouting foetus. The importance of connection that eruses neither the pregnant woman nor the foetus is maintained physiologically and theoretically through the connective tissues of the placental organ. The second potential mediated through the placenta is a refiguration of the relationship between subject and body more generally. The possibility of an organ that does not belong to one body, but rather is turned to multiple sites, reforms embodied subjectivity in terms that are much more fluid. Rather than seeking to reinstate the pregnant subject at the centre of the frame, the placenta allows for a new notion of subjectivity that does not depend on closed edges in order to construct itself. The identity of the pregnant subject, in this reading, is not threatened through the multiplication implicit in pregnancy, but is rather expanded and altered by the shifting corporeal terrain. In the conflict generated between maternal and foetal entities through recent visual interpretations of pregnancy, the possibility of only one subject occupying the frame appears as axiomatic. The outing of the foetus necessitates the erusure of the pregnant woman. But, through the placenta, the possibility of an embodied subjectivity that does not define its edges against the edges of the other subject can be thought. In this reading, the pregnant woman could remain in the frame at the same time as a foetal entity entered. The porous and pliable nature of the boundaries that are at once enacted and disavowed in the placenta mark a subjective framing that does not depend on the figure of one, or even two. Rather, as Irigaray argued in her examination of the morphology of the vaginal lips, these figurations are expanded and reformed. This article seeks to reformulate pregnant embodiment in these expanded terms. v new hat Feminist work on the impact of visual technologies in the past decade has allowed for new understandings of the stakes involved in their increasing use in pregnancy. The feminist critique of the medicalization of pregnancy from the early 1980s examined how autonomy and bodily integrity were at risk for women as pregnancy moved further into the domain of the medical. More recently, theorists have identified that the deployment of visual images of pregnancy not only alters the woman's experience of pregnancy and her decision-making capacity, but also alters the definition of maternity more generally. Many of these accounts have centred on the new presence on the social stage of the foetus. In Disembodying Women, Barbara Duden asks JuneMaree Maher fe m i n ist revi ew 72 2 0 0 2 97</page><page sequence="4">How did the unborn turn into a billboard image and how did that isolated goblin get into the limelight? How did the female peritoneum acquire transparency? What set of circumstances made the skinning of women acceptable and inspired public concern for what happens in her innards? And, finally, the embarrassing question: how was it possible to mobilize so many women as uncomplaining agents of this skinning and as willing witnesses to this haunting symbol of loneliness? (Duden, 1993: 7) Duden considers that the public foetus has become one of the most recognizable and potent symbols of modern culture. The infunt can be seen, before it can exist in the world, and it assumes a discrete and contained form. It is a pre-formed person, 'simply ... awaiting discovery' (Hartouni, 1997: 23). Adams (1994) argues that the foetus is portrayed as the 'quintessential human being' (Adams, 1994: 4) with its yet to be fulfilled potential. Images of the foetus published in Life magazine in 1966 are seen as critical in allowing for a major shift in the cultural and social understanding of pregnancy and feminist theorists have engaged with the varying expression of this change in the following decades.1 Although these accounts differ on many points, and in emphasis, there is a consensus on the implications of the processes of visualization for pregnant women and women more generally. The distinction and development of the foetal subject leads to the erusure of the woman. I consider that the certainty of this reading of the impact of visualization on pregnancy depends on two factors. The first is an understanding of the visual field as fixed in its outlines and parameters. The second is a notion of subjectivity that depends on the location of a subject within the confines of a single embodied unit. The pregnant body, with its complication of both the visual field and the subjective framework fulls outside these commonly understood cartographies and thus is continually at the point of erusure. Refiguring the visual and reformulating the subjective allows the productivities of this pregnant body to be more fully explored. revising the frame The representation and pre-eminence of the foetus in images of pregnancy, Duden has suggested act in service of the 'lust of the eye' (1993: 16). These representations of two entities in the form of the pregnant body construct for the viewer a comfortable and recognizable cartography of the interior of the pregnant body. Rather than a clear vision of the multiple and entwined body/subject exchanges that are irreducible in pregnancy, the deployment of visual readings confirms the singularity and divisibility of the foetal and maternal entities. The question of intelligibility is a critical one in the case of foetal imaging through ultrusound and has a crucial bearing on how we understand the operation of the visual field. There are two levels on which this visual definition operates that I consider can be contested by a focus on the placenta as it operates in the 1 Both Duden and Adams allude to the publication of these images. They are also canvassed by Newman (1996) and Stabile (1994). Stabile (1994), in particular, analyzes the change in the image between 1966 and 1990, arguing that this offers a context for other social and theoretical changes that have occurred in the reproductive field in the period. Newman's account places the images in a m uch longe r history of visual representations of pregnancy. For further accounts of the operation of the visual in the construction of the free foetus, see the following critiques: Daniels (1993) explores the res po nse of th e U S legal system to a growing sense of foetal personhood; Condit (1990) and Petchesky (1987, 1990) consider its implications in the abortion debates- Richard (1995) notes the increasing 98 fe m i n; st rev i ew 72 2 0 0 2 visibly pregnant: toward a placental body</page><page sequence="5">pressures for foetal surgery; Roberts (1997) argues the implicit racial and racist implications of the new visual construction of pregnancy; Stabile (1994), Squier (1994) and Newman (1996) construct histories of the visual technological advances themselves and ponder the implications; Franklin (1995) and Strathern (1995) explore the implications for kinship networks of this new foetal subject. 2 The discussion of this distinction by Strathern (1992) in Reproducing the Future: £ssays on anthropology, kinship and the new reproductive technologies is an extremely illuminating account of the important differences that emerge for models of knowing from these forms of understanding. pregnant body. The first concerns the framing of sight as a vector for gathering knowledge. Imaged understandings of pregnancy almost always constrain themselves within the visually possible figure of the two, the separated bodies of woman and foetus. The function of an image, of sight as a knowledge form, is precisely to define edges that close off and bound any entity. Thus, the rendering of the pregnant body in the figure of two is comprehensible as a response to the imperatives of the visual field. But it is salutury to keep in mind the criteria of intelligibility that are employed to read and disseminate these images. For these modes of visualization, which result in the anthropomorphic foetus, run directly counter to common scientific understandings of foetal development. In their presentation of the foetus as formed, they deny epigenesis, the widely accepted model of foetal development. Rather than depicting a process where the embryo becomes more complex morphologically at each point, visual technologies present a fully formed foetal 'human'. Size is the only element of change that is recognized.2 Tuana (1990) has argued that epigenesis has been scientifically established and recognized for some time, but has not realty impacted on understandings of pregnancy. Instead, even as the developmental interaction is noted empirically, its mechanical representation is continued (Tuana, 1990). This notion of the pre-formed foetal subject exists even though we know that the foetal development of the lungs, for example, is not completed until 23-24 weeks. Although visual modes of intervention in pregnancy have become the preferred method of management and understanding in pregnancy, there is space to contest the implications of such knowledge, since other knowledges, even other scientific understandings such as epigenesis, do not present the same frames of reference. The visual scientific frame offers a comprehensible picture that accords with socio- cultural understandings, even when these do not fully reflect the morphological and physiological terrain of the pregnant body. This scene is further complicated by the way in which the technological apparatus operates. As Condit (1995) notes, the images produced by these technologies are only intelligible to the trained eye - the actual visual objects produced are indistinct and uncertain. Condit's description of ultrusound as a technology that bounces sound waves off dense matter in order to provide an outline of the foetal body makes the paradoxical nature of visualization techniques very clear. The images are actually records of a series of absences and presences, where the absence of dense matter allows for the definition of the foetus. It is not the actual foetal matter that is being rendered visible, but rather the emptiness of the surrounding terrain. Squier (1994) also alludes to this 'camera lie', as does Petchesky (1987). This rereading of the visual field both speaks with the analysis above and goes beyond it. The maternal and foetal entities apparently offered through the visual field are revealed as a series of absences and presences operating together to construct a particular image. Acknowledging how this interplay operates allows for its reworking. Recognition that the absence and JaneMaree Maher fe m i n i st revi ew 72 2 0 0 2 99</page><page sequence="6">presence of matter is used to structure readings of the pregnant body indicates that the terrain of that pregnant body is not fixed, but rather is mediated in and through particular representations. The second part of this article will focus on the activity of the placenta in the pregnant body, seeking to mediate the possibilities of representations of the pregnant body in a different way. It is the conjunction of technological possibilities and social trujectories that have combined to make the interior of the pregnant body fully visible in the way that we see it today. Its representation as a container for the foetal body is a product of visual coding rather than visibility itself. But the deployment of visual signs, as evidenced by Sacks' man and the hat, is not immutable. The possibility of refiguring the signs and reading a different text necessitates a closer look at the pregnant body, as well as contesting the meaning of the visual markers already in play.3 The possibility of examining the defining tropes of the visual field and reworking them forms the basis for my investigation of the placenta. I suggest that it offers a potential material disruption to the visual field as it now stands. 3 Petschky, Daniels and Condit have a11 argued that visual field has been too easily ceded and should be more closely examined. 100 fe m i n i st rev i ew 72 2 0 0 2 visibly pregnant: toward a placental body turning back into the body The primary result of the foetal focus described above is the separation of the foetal body from the maternal bodyj But this distinction is precisely the difficulty that the technologies were designed to overcome. Previous representations of the foetus depended on understandings gained from expelled or aborted foetuses (Petchesky, 1987, 1997; Condit, 1995). It is the capacity of techniques such as ultrusound to allow viewing of the foetus in situ that mark it out as a new and exciting scientific possibility. It is an interesting irony therefore that the technology's purpose is obscured in the ways in which resulting knowledges and understandings are deployed. The treatment of the foetal putient depends precisely on the maintenance and integrity of the systems that attach the foetal body to the maternal body. The revolution wrought by visual technologies is centred on the capacity of science and medicine to view the foetus in the pregnant body. But this insight is systematically occluded in the representation of how these technologies work. The concept of the process that underpins understandings of pregnancy and the successful operation of visual technologies is obfuscated by the dominant paradigms of the stilled and discrete image. In my exploration of the morphology and activity of the pregnant body, process is a key factor that must be included in a new construction of the visual field. It is also the key term in reconstituting subjectivity in readings of pregnancy and in other formulations of the embodied subject. If one can understand the relation between the maternal and foetal entities as fluid and processual, as placental, pregnancy ceases to represent a contest for full articulation between two subjects potentially in competition. Instead, the possibility of an embodied subject that does not</page><page sequence="7">depend on the fixity of its edges emerges. Pregnancy, in this reading, is not only a specific feminine embodied state, but also models new corporeal possibilities, where the engagement with another corporeal entity represents productivity and not threat. The sociological and phenomenological landscape where the visual field has resulted in the disuppearance of the pregnant woman can be challenged through a corporeal landscape where subjectivity constitutes itself in more fluid forms. This argument is not directed toward creating a space or a basis for a foetal subject, as part of revisioning the pregnant body. The woman represents the only subject on the site. But the reading made possible by focusing on the placenta allows for subjectivity itself to be rethought. Here, the particular specifications of embodied gestation point to and enact different modes of subjectivity that would not result in necessury division between the maternal and the foetal that has emerged in the visual landscape of pregnancy. Instead, the subjectivity assigned to the pregnant body is made more complex in conversation with its corporeal shifts. The productivities of the pregnant body itself as part of the discourse of pregnancy and subjectivity are brought into focus. The active nature of embodiment, especially in pregnancy, refigures what we commonly read as the subjective discourses. Rather than the subjectivity of the pregnant woman being compromised, the matter of the placenta allows conceptions of new forms of subjectivity. Drawing on the work of biologist Helene Rouch, Schwab (1994) identifies that the placenta plays a role that is much more complex than simply nourishing the foetus. Rather, following Irigaray, she argues that the placenta represents the veil which always signifies the separateness of the maternal body and the foetal entity. The placenta participutes in the structural connection of the pregnant body as well as disallowing a collapse into an unmediated subjective connection or corporeal confusion. Instead, a tension between connection and distinction is maintained and explored at the site of the placenta. It is this productive nexus that I will use to frame my consideration of the gestating body and its implications for embodied subjectivity. placentally located The gestating body offers a rich and intricate landscape that can be used to contest the reductive readings of visual markers that have been criticized by feminist theorists. Foremost among the morphological possibilities is the placenta, an irreducible component of pregnancy. Without a functioning placenta, the relation between the pregnant woman and the foetus cannot be sustained. It is this point that distinguishes and connects the foetal and maternal entities. In what follows, I argue that the operation of the placenta allows for a reconfiguration of pregnancy. In both its function and its material existence, JuneMaree Maher fe m i n i st rev i ew 72 2 0 0 2 101</page><page sequence="8">the placenta offers a new perspective on the embodied unity that seems absent from articulations and visualizations of pregnancy. The space of the pregnant body is one that continually changes. It moves outward towards its environment, necessitating new occuputions of sputial co-ordinates. In particular, it challenges those modes of motility that confine the feminine in the world (young, 1990). The pregnant body is an active and excessive force, refusing the stable connotations of morphology implied at the interior and exterior of the subject body. It assumes all the overdetermined cultural signs of passivity and femininity, social reproduction, but it also pushes outward and disturbs those boundaries. Pregnancy both contradicts and asserts the cyclical nature of the woman's body. The menstrual cycle constructs the woman's body as unstable, flowing rather than concrete and fixed. Pregnancy then, moves away from that particular definitive flow-it is a cessation of menstruation and, in some way, a point of stasis. At the same moment, it signals a new periodicity and outward flow in its temporal engagement in reproductive activity. yet, as indicated above, the production and representation of this shifting morphological modulity of pregnancy is problematic. The visually-driven conceptions of the reproducing body structure the terrain in a static and determined frame. In this drive, culturally comfortable inscriptions of foetal subjects are achieved and the potentially contestatory materiality of the body in maternity is disembodied and disuppears. Morphologically, the pregnant body presents visually as a singular and unified body, it has the visual contours of bodily integrity that underpin the possibility of a unified subject. The protrusion of the belly seen in pregnancy does not constitute a break in the integrity of the body. Instead, a process of retracing the edges can be seen, a gradual transformation in a still-unified corporeal space. In this way, the pregnant body participates in the production of bodies as sites on which particular Western requirements of subjective identity can be located. yet, it also acts as a subversion of this signified meaning. In its expansive and malleable materiality, the pregnant body accommodates and contains the body of another. It simultaneously symbolizes penetration and incorporation, with all the cultural resonance that these terms imply. The foundational possibility of bodily integrity and subjectivity is at once preserved and radically restructured. This body of the one is simultaneously the body of the two. In exchanges of nourishment, bodily secretions, waste fluid, in tiredness, heaviness and hormonal fluctuations, two corporeal entities share the same material space. The foetal body and the woman's body in maternity have at once a separate register of interests, as well as a common one. The placenta is located at the centre of these conflictive inscriptions of the pregnant body. It forms as an organ at the point of exchange between the developing foetus and the gestating woman. It partakes in, and facilitates the process of development. The placenta is marked out from the rest of the conceptus 102 feminist review 72 2002 visibly pregnant: toward a placental body</page><page sequence="9">at about the 14-day mark. At this point, the four-celled fertilized egg develops what is known as the primitive streak. This streak will become the spinal column of the developing embryo, later the foetus. The cells that are not part of this development are the placental cells. In this instance, the placenta's peculiar role of authorization can be seen. It is the 'not 1' that defines and distinguishes the foetus from its surrounds. Strathern (1992) has noted that the Warnock Report acceded to a 14-day limit for embryo experimentation, due to this understanding of foetal and placenta distinction. This distinction was felt to provide evidence of an individuated potential. Thus, the placenta itself emerges into corporeal being in concert with the foetus in a process which has meaning attributed to it. In its citation as non-originary material, the placenta is in excess of the definitional boundaries that are deployed in representations of the reproducing body.4 It is also in excess of the relation between gestating body and foetal entity, but it is necessary for their co-existence. In describing the role of the placenta, it is important to note the extent to which this terrain is distant from body projects that are instrumental expressions of a subjective will. Neither the foetus nor the pregnant woman can intentionally engage the process of being pregnant. Exposure to fertilization can occur, but the question of implantation and development are outside the control of any subject in the process, technicians of assisted reproductive processes included. One cannot direct the placenta to grow and perform its functions. One cannot expand the skin to accommodate the growing uterine space. One cannot control the hormonal shifts that loosen and soften the body in maternity. Technologies of conception, for all their sophistication, cannot even ensure the commencement of the process. In pregnancy, intention can only engage the contours of the process (a good diet, relaxation, appropriate clothing and rest), but cannot activate it. The subject, unlike the placenta, can never situate itself at the origin of the bodily project of pregnancy. The placenta acts as the mediation point for the two corporeal sites, woman and foetus, that are involved in the process of pregnancy. This is where the cross-over occurs-of blood, nourishment, waste fluid. This is the liminal point of between that is always already within. It is also, strikingly, the point at which technological conceptive advances are halted. The major factor preventing the achievement of ectogenesis - gestation of a foetus outside the womb of a woman - is the difficulty of creating or reproducing a functioning placenta. Here is an organ that exists only in this process of pregnancy, only as a mode of exchange between two corporeal entities. It is expelled after the period of gestation, discarded by both bodies at the time of birth, becoming useless to both at the point at which they become-materially, figuratively, representationally-two bodies instead of one. It is an organ that offends against the concept of bodily integrity, in and of itself. It acts for two sites of body, provisionally. It has a discrete temporal location, after which it is exhausted. yet, this organ resists transferability or recreation. Unlike the other bodily fluids and parts involved in conceptive technology, it 4 In a formulation which I found had sign if i cant resonance with the way I am positioning the placenta, Strathern (1992: 152) describes a 'fractal person' as 'one with a reJationship implied'. This sense of incomplete embodied existence, that which suggests in its form its connection to other, is apposite here for my rendition of the placenta as a marker of embodied i nterdependence JaneMaree Maher fe m i n i st rev i ew 72 2 0 0 2 103</page><page sequence="10">cannot be extracted, re-routed or resituated. It can only exist at the point of intersection between two corporeal sites sharing one bodily space, and it can only exist there for as long as this related corporeality continues. It connects them, but belongs to neither, and can only exist for and at the site of the two.5 In its particular citation as the 'bloody sieve ... the point at which their fluids meet' (Rothman, 1989a), the placenta positions itself at the point of bodily secretion which has often been identified as the most problematic for Cartesian conceptions of a unified and discrete body object. It is fluid exchange, which 'attestrs] to the permeability of the body, its necessary dependence on an outside, its liability to collapse into this outside ... [an] affront to the subject's aspirations ... [to] the "clean" and "proper"' (Grosz, 1994). In the case of the placenta, fluid exchange must be seen as an inherent and constituitive mode, with all the attendant dangers, difficulties and productivity. Katz Rothman cites knowledge that the placenta passed harmful substances as vital in the construction of the mother's body as a place of danger, rather than a haven (Rothman, 1989a,b), thereby focusing on the importance of this organ and its fluid constitution. The matter of the placenta is largely fluid and counteracts the static tropes of representations of gestation. The ceaseless flow of fluids, the physical adjustments of the pregnant body, as the bladder becomes smaller, the on-going expansion of the uterus is not captured in the still images drawn from medical visual technologies. The fluid and expansive possibilities of the placenta can be read as a disruptive materiality. It contests any separation, since it marks out the imbrication and fluidity of the pregnant body, but it also refuses an uncomplicated collapse. In material and theoretical ways then, the placenta acts as a synecdoche of the entire process of pregnancy. 5 There are certain conditions where the placenta does not function in its transmission role. These disorders include the hydatiform mole where anomalous celis of the piacenta became cl potentially fatal mcilignancy, as wel I as more common disorders like placenta previa and placental insufficiency. I do not decil with the pcithologies of the placenta, cis they constitute an area where the relation on which I have based my argument, between foetils, placenta and maternal/gestating body ceases to operate. When analyzing the images of the free floating foetus offered by Lennart Nillson in 1966, Newman (1996) notes that the 'placental mass [is] cut away' in order to reveal the 'otherwise invisible foetus' (Newman, 1996: 13). Condit (1990) argues that an accurate picture of a young foetus must include the placenta, but that this rarely occurs as it would distinguish the foetus from its human adult counterpart. Inserting the placenta into our conceptions of the pregnant body not only works to reinscribe how the foetus differs from the pregnant woman, but it also allows for a clearer view of the processual nature of gestation. While visual technologies have resulted in a conception of the pregnant woman as made up of separable pieces, the location and function of the placenta indicate the irreducible and complex interconnectedness of the various entities in this process. conclusion Common representational tropes of the pregnant body emphasize an oppositional corporeality and an oppositional subjectivity. In legal discourses, the impetus has 104 feminist review 72 2002 visibly pregnant: toward a placental body</page><page sequence="11">been to establish a series of rights, which constitute maternal and foetal entities as conflicting. In medical discourse, the pregnant body is the dangerous container. When I view pregnant bodies through the matter of the placenta, there is a challenge to this representational order. (Luce Irigaray's argument in 'When our Lips speak together' bases itself on a similar morphological moment in This Sex which is Not One.). It confronts distinctions between 'mother' and 'child' and the practice of binary thinking. The discrete representation of these two entities negates the bodily activity of gestation and the specific corporeal implications for subjectivity in and of this process. A gestating woman's body in maternity cannot be conflated with the figure of mother, for it is necessarily a process rather than a stable site. A foetus cannot be considered analogous to a child, as its body boundaries are necessarily open to the gestating woman that incorporates it. The continuous flux and exchange of pregnancy mean that a clear definition of 'mother' and 'child' cannot easily be established. Construction of the pregnant body as a split entity through visual technologies cannot encompass the complexities of embodied experience and morphological confusion that are found there. A focus on the placenta opens up these conventional representations of pregnancy, constructed by the viewing paradigms. Rather than allowing for the insistent figure of two, the placenta makes explicit the links and forms the precondition for the pregnant state. Without the placenta, the body of the woman cannot sustain the foetus, and without the foetus, the woman ceases to be pregnant. The placenta, in its location in the gestating body, can be read as matter and metaphor for a different understanding of gestation and the pregnant body. Instead of the divisive view of pregnancy as two-in-one, the placenta calls for an understanding of the singularity and fluidity of this bodily incarnation. The porous nature of the placental division between maternal and foetal matter is part of its ambiguous and challenging nature. It notes the link between the two entities and it provides a space where difference can be constituted, prefiguring a move toward the separation that will occur at birth. When we consider the function of the placental organ as matter and metaphor, it offers itself as emblematic of a new conception of pregnancy and of subjectivity. Conventionally deployed images seek to confirm the singularity of the body/subject relation and thus formulate conflict between the pregnant woman and the putative foetal subject. The functioning placenta in pregnancy contests this conventional subject narration. The pregnant subject partially directs her body and is partially refigured by the process of pregnancy. The foetus can be seen inside that frame, neither self-identical to it nor separate from it. The interactions of the corporeal and the subjective are complex and can not be fully distinguished. Rather than offering a way to confirm subjectivity as the central narrative at play in pregnancy, a relocation of the placenta as irreducible allows for new visions of subjective interaction where connection and distinction are not necessarily framed as mutually exclusive terms.
