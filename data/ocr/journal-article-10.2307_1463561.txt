ISBN 0-8164-0388-0. The virtues of this book we have come to expect from Professor Macquarrie's previous writings. It is commendably lucid, readable, interesting, and concise. In relatively short compass we are offered a description of hope which clearly sets forth a variety of Old Testament, New Testament, and modern theological perspectives and concludes with the author's own fascinating explanation of how it is "possible" to embrace Christian hope today. In fact, "possibility" is a central theme for Macquarrie. An acceptable hope, we are told, must be shown to lie within the realm of what is possible. Hope itself, it turns out, is grounded in the possibility of human existence to seek authentic fulfilment. The best resources for understanding all this are to be found in phenomenological descriptions of the self and, lest these be interpreted in too individualistic a fashion, in the theories of relativity and emergent evolution. Thus Thomas and Heidegger are paired with Einstein, Teilhard, and Lionel Thornton. Bloch is referred to favorably but does not significantly influence the argument. Moltmann and Pannenberg are criticized together as futurists neglecting present experience. Whether such an approach can adequately accommodate a biblical eschatology is, of course, subject to question. The difficulty is most evident in Macquarrie's failure to distinguish hoping as a human attitude from hope as a designation for deity. His discussion of God as "Thou hope of Israel" (Jer. 14:8) and of Jesus Christ as "the hope of the world" is finally controlled by the Thomistic account of hoping as the embracing of that which is difficult but possible to attain. The fly in this anthropological ointment is "promise." In Macquarrie's view, to say that God literally promises would be mythological and, for some reason left unexplained, crudely anthropomorphic. The biblical emphasis upon the promise of God must be seen to be simply the promising character of existence, an anthropological potentiality. Just as hoping is vulnerable and fallible so also must be God's promise. It is plain that we are a far remove here from any notion of God's unconditional covenantal grace or of Paul's "hope against hope" in the promised vindication of God's righteousness. To say that God's promise means that human existence is promising is like saying that God's grace means our avoidance of clumsiness. Those old mythic forerunners of the faith, Abraham and Sarah, must still be falling on their faces laughing. Christopher Morse Union Theological Seminary, New York</page></plain_text>
