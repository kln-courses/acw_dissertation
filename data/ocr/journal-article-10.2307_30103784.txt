<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN EARLY HELLADIC FIGURINE FROM THEBES, BOEOTIA' (PLATE 4) FIND LOCATION THE miniature female figurine of bone, inv. No. B. E. 27io8, in the Thebes Museum was found during a salvage excavation in the town of Thebes, in 1995' (FIG. I, PLATE 4 a-c). The plot of Neroutsos and Al. Panagiotidi on 30 Pelopidou Street (in the south-east part of Kadmeia), which yielded this find, borders on the south the plot of the Old People's Home of the Metropolis of Thebes and Levadeia where the Early Helladic II 'Fortified Building' was unearthed in I985. Less than 50 m to the south-west an EH II apsidal building had been excavated in 1975 (Manisalis plot).3 At the plot on 30 Pelopidou Street, EH settlement remains were discovered belonging to successive phases of habitation. The figurine under consideration was found in Area 9. It lay among rather small stones, c. o.Io m above a clay patch with a H-shaped frame. This and other clay patches revealed at the same depth are the remnants of a room floor. The walls of this room have not been found. The most common shapes among the pottery collected in the layer concerned (PLATE 4 d), are small-sized bowls with an in-turned rim and unperforated lugs, and of bigger size as well with a T-shaped rim. Both types appear in the burnished and 'Urfirnis' wares.4 Except for a conical and unpainted example, their bases are flat. In general the assemblage presents the characteristics of Thebes Group B,5 apart from certain sherds of the partially glazed and of the dark on light categories.6 DESCRIPTION Standing, naked female figurine. Missing the head, which was broken off the neck in the past, and the feet, which were separate inserted piece/s. Minor surface damage on the legs. The upper arms, although they form part of the trunk, are clearly marked off. The forearms and hands are rendered in relief on the body: the right hand bent on to the stomach and the left on the chest between the breasts. Incisions mark three fingers on the right hand and four on the left apart from the thumbs. The breasts are not symmetrical. The legs, with I thank the conservator of the Thebes Museum, Mr P. Valmas, Mrs M. Vasileiou for the excellent drawing of the figurine, the photographer Mr Dimitris Tamviskos, and my colleague Dr Polyxeni Bougia for her help in improving the English text. 2 The excavation at the Neroutsos-Panagiotidi plot was conducted by the 9th Ephoreia of Antiquities under the supervision of the writer.

The pubic triangle is rendered by means of grooves. The spine is indicated by a shallow groove extending from below the neck down to the waist. A deeper groove separates the buttocks. Despite the miniature scale, the naturalistic rendering of the figurine is remarkable. It is the work of an artist rather than an artisan. Material: Bone. All surfaces are very well polished. However, on the inner side of the left leg tool marks are visible. Dimensions: Preserved H. 0.03 m, W. max. o.oo8 m, Th. max. o.oo45 m. ANALYSIS The frontal standing posture, the flexion at the knees, the arrangement of the arms, as well as the other traits of the figurine associate it with Cycladic figurines of the folded arm type.7 Precious information is irretrievably gone due to loss of the head and the feet. Leaving aside, for the moment, the small size and the material, and taking into account the slender proportions, the plasticity of the volumes and the smooth contours, the figurine is comparable to the figures of the Kapsala variety.8 Both Kapsala and Spedos varieties show broken profile at the hips and at the knees. The marked pubic triangle characterizes the figurines of the Dokathismata and Chalandriani varieties. The position of the arms, of course, does not suit a 'canonical' EC II figurine. The arrangement with the right arm horizontal and the left diagonal is linked with the male type of the hunter/warrior figurine,'o and is also depicted on female idols." Figure no. 312 in the N. P.

The deviations from the norm concerning the position of the folded arms have been associated with the Chalandriani variety or thought to belong to another group of figures, a 'postcanonical' one of EC III date.'s The meaning of these arrangements is elusive.'4 The Theban figurine presents characteristics of different varieties of the folded arm figurine type, as well as individualities, like the legs separated in their whole length. The regularity of the legs and their perforations indicate that separate inserted feet were part of the original design and that the legs were not drilled later on the occasion of a repair.'s This is also true for a miniature figurine from the Hagia Triada tholos tomb in the Mesara,'6 with apparently inserted arms. Separate carving was possibly dictated by the nature of the material. Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that this particular detail is related to the purpose the figurine fulfilled. The feet could have been part of another object, maybe a pin, which the figurine crowned, although such objects are not known. If it was an independent article it may have served as a pendant, suspended from its neck.'7 Anthropomorphic bone figurines are mainly encountered in the north-east Aegean, in most cases completely schematic.'8 The use of bone or ivory for figurines and miniatures in general is nearly unknown in the Cyclades, where stone or shell is preferred.'9 The bone pins with a bird-shaped finial from the Syros cemetery are an exception.20 Euboea, the cemetery at Manika, has yielded one more example.2' The only anthropomorphic, miniature bone figurine of Cycladic type so far known comes also from the Manika cemetery.22 But, since it is schematic, it is not comparable to the naturalistic Theban one. Bone and ivory are normally used in Crete to produce small-scale or miniature figurines of Cycladic type or inspiration.23 Moreover, the Cretan Koumasa variety comprises figures shorter than those of the other Cycladic types. Except in Crete, ivory was extremely rare in the rest of Early Bronze Age Greece. Only one ivory human leg from Lerna is known.24 Anyway, the material was not unknown to EH Thebes, as shown by a nearly cylindrical worked piece of ivory, apparently adorning an object of prestige.25 '3 Renfrew (n. 8), i7;J.

It follows Cycladic prototypes and it was executed in miniature scale due perhaps to restrictions imposed by the material. The selection of the specific material renders its import from the islands improbable. The morphology of the figurine does not contradict the chronology suggested on the basis of the ceramic context, i.e. EH II-III. The bone figurine presented here provides evidence concerning the relations between Thebes and the Cyclades. Putting aside the complicated problem of the origin of the rock-cut tombs in Boeotian EH cemeteries and the Manika cemetery on Euboea as well,27 light can be shed on this matter by the systematic examination of the imported Cycladic objects and their local imitations. Of the former category, objects other than obsidian are reported to have been found in Boeotia, at settlements (Eutresis, Lithares) and cemeteries (Paralimni).28 From the EH settlement in Thebes, obsidian cores and tools are known from several excavated plots. Fragments of marble Cycladic bowls are reported from the Old People's Home plot and from the apsidal building on the Manisalis plot. In the latter, EC pottery was also found.29 Frying- pans of Cycladic type, considered local products, are mentioned among other finds from Lithares. Konsola also identified shapes of purely Cycladic character among the vases of Thebes Group B.30 Although the relations between Boeotia and the Cyclades have been a topic of discussion for a long time, a special study gathering and evaluating all the existing data is still lacking. Consequently, the Cycladic influence on Thebes has been either over- or underestimated. The idea that contacts between the two areas occurred via Euboea is the main issue in the relevant discussion.3s' In the light of the available evidence, it cannot be proved whether this excellent figurine was made in a Theban workshop. However, this is a reasonable assumption, since the excavations have already shown that Thebes was a powerful centre during the EH II and EH III periods. Ministry of Culture Department of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities ELENI ANDRIKOU 26 Marangou (n. 17), 96, recognizes a possible figurine in the conical object from the Manisalis plot, which appears improbable.
