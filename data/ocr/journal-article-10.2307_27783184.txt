<plain_text><page sequence="1">VII. (Partisan of erotic absolutism)* Partisan of erotic absolutism, reticent megalomaniac even among the diving frog-men, messenger at the same time of the halo Paul Celan, I don't evoke the petrifying physiognomies of the aerial naufrage, but once, every decade (or more), I don't skate, but only at a very late hour, on a lake guarded by the giant forest of the acephalous members of the Universal Poets' Conspiracy. It's obvious that one can't penetrate there with the arrows of a visible fire. An immense curtain of amethyst dissimulates, at the world's skirt, the existence of this anthropomorphic vegetation, beyond which I try out, selenically, a dance that should amaze myself. So far, I haven't succeeded and, with my eyes shifted to my temples, I watch myself in profile and await the Spring. *March u, 1947</page></plain_text>
