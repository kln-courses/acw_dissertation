Generally speaking, this is a carefully prepared manual of good practical value as an aid to the understanding of the actual workings of the present system for coping with the problem of mental deficiency. LIONEL S. PENROSE. Phases in the Religion of Ancient Rome. By CYRIL BAILEY. (London: Oxford University Press; Humphrey Milford. I932. Pp. ix + 340. Price I5s.) As might be expected from him, Mr. Cyril Bailey's lectures on Roman religion, recently delivered before the University of California, are of the highest quality, being at once rich in ripe scholarship and in style admirably clear as well as charming. Very skilfully he manages to cover the whole ground by distinguishing what he cautiously terms "phases," which in so far as they can be shown more or less to form a succession in time amount pretty well to the stages of an historical development and one that corresponds closely with the general expansion of ideas and functions accompanying the evolution of a city-state into an empire. In its turn the purely Roman advance from pre-animistic beginnings, through animism and anthropomorphism, to self-conscious forms of cult with an ethico-theological basis, accords entirely with the process or progress that marks the growth of religious experience wherever savagery, or, let us say, barbarism, can be observed as it gradually changes into civilization. In a way Rome, as judged by comparative standards, shows a certain backwardness, as if in its native soul it clung to the old ways and owed to foreign impulsion most of its desire to subject traditional rituals to rationalization. For that reason, more especially when he contrasts the livelier imagination of Greece as it toys with theology-though the effect on cult was perhaps less than might be supposed-the classical scholar is apt to impute to the genuine old Roman rather less religion than he would be ready to do if he were an anthropologist accustomed to dig for the roots of religious faith and practice in stony soil, where only a few feeble germs are likely to reward the most sympathetic research. Mr. Bailey, however, with the illuminating groundwork of Warde Fowler to guide him along the right path, has done his best to include within the "circuit of his musings" everything that belongs to that very miscellaneous group of phenomena labelled "magico-religious" by those theorists who wish to hedge. Nor does he thereupon proceed on the authority of Sir James Frazer to chop this group into two disparate halves with a logical hatchet that treats the magical as equivalent to the pseudo-scientific; as if the use of material symbols implied a materialistic outlook. Mr. Bailey sees clearly enough, for instance, that the silex preserved in the temple of Jupiter Fere- trius had to do with rudimentary religion, though he is even so inclined to speak of "magic" in such a connexion, as if a baby qua rudimentary man was not quite human. But the anthropologist ought to have no doubt at all that a rain-stone goes with religion in the making. Thus the Seligmans have recently shown that side by side in the Nile Valley are Nilotes who worship a rain-god by means of prayer and through the mediation of a king who is killed while yet in his prime, like the priest of Nemi, to keep his intercessional vigour up to the mark; whereas the Nilo-Hamites alongside use rain-stones -often a neolithic cult, the far-travelled "thunder-weapon"-and only employ rain-makers, who are, however, sometimes slain in order to encourage 121</page><page sequence="2">PHILOSOPHY the others. This difference perhaps entitles the Nilotes to rank for typological purposes in a higher class, though it is doubtful whether a Nilo-Hamite, on going over to their method of obtaining rain, would be conscious of any "uplift," or even of any definite break with his former procedure. The truth is that too many of the data on which the interpreter of Roman or Greek religion has to rely are in the nature of mere gobbets, hardly more instructive on the face of them than the oddments that are marked "ceremonial objects" in an ethnological museum. One cannot deduce the doctrine of the Church of England from a dean's gaiters exposed in a shop-window; and so a rain- stone or whatnot has a religious meaning that may turn hardly at all on its being a stone. Mr. Bailey, while successfully avoiding the neologism "the numinous," which truly is enough to set a scholar's teeth on edge, nevertheless would seem to equate numen with anima as if "the Power manifesting itself in the universe" must be necessarily conceived under a ghost-like form, which, with all respects towards ghosts, who certainly are powerful manifesta- tions of a kind, is surely not the case in the diversified experience of mankind. But these, after all, are matters of opinion touching a very ticklish question of classification which it is difficult to apply at once universally and to a given case considered per se. Mr. Bailey is so fair to all his stock of varied facts that anthropologists of all schools will be as grateful to him as the world of scholars. R. R. MARETT. Prejudice and Impartiality. By G. C. FIELD, M.A., B.Sc. (London: Methuen &amp; Co. I932. Pp. vii + ii6. Price 2s. 6d.) We cannot receive this book without offering a welcome to the series of which it is the first volume. These "Monographs on Philosophy and Psycho- logy" are intended to present studies of a popular but serious character in those problems that have a very general interest. The publishers are to be congratulated both for having instituted a series to which there is no com- petitor, and for having secured Professor Field as editor. Together with this volume a second has appeared on the psychology of study, by Mr. Mace, and further ones are projected on intelligence, on applied logic, and on the evidence of the senses. The format is well chosen; each volume slips easily into the pocket. Professor Field's interesting choice of subject strikes an excellent first note, for it is less the popularized exposition of a technical problem than the appli- cation of a trained temper, knowledge and insight to a question of patent everyday concern. Prejudice is a perpetual and ubiquitous nuisance, and a psychological diagnosis of and prescription for it needs no apology. The author first moves Socratically to a definition of it as judging under the influence of irrelevant emotions, then, after an analysis of judging, determines the point at which irrelevant emotions interfere, passes on to a survey of the kinds of emotional tendency-self-interest, group-loyalty, habit, etc.- chiefly at work, and concludes with a number of thoroughly practical sug- gestions on the reduction of our liability to prejudice. The technical core of the content, derived from what may be called the orthodox introspective psychology (free, that is, from the oracles of psycho-analysis), will be familiar to students; it is the presentation that calls for notice-its remarkable clarity and ease of movement, its relation at every point to veridical situations, and its frequent condensation into very shrewd observation. On a small book so admirably adapted to so admirable a purpose, a reviewer has no excuse to 122</page></plain_text>
