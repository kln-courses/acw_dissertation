<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> ANDREW FELDHERR Viewing Myth and History on the Shield of Aeneas This article analyzes the representational strategies Vergil uses in the description of the shield of Aeneas to shape the reception of his text. Three aspects of the ekphrasis highlight its ambiguous status as a literary representation figuring itself as a material presence that can become part of history as well as depicting it. First, descriptions of rivers frame narrative units within book 8 as though the text were a visual image, while failing to perform such a function in the case of the shield itself. Rivers also symbolize both the linear progression of the narrative and its static visual surface. Second, the presence of multiple levels of internal spectators simultaneously reminds Vergil’s audience of the differences between poem and image and image and reality and provides focalizing perspectives from which each represented image can be perceived as real. Finally, intertextual references to defining features of historiography as a literary genre provide a model for how literary accounts of the past can influence events. But the comparison with historiography also draws attention to what Vergil does differently, particularly his direct representation of divine action and his refashioning of history’s linear order into a circular, spatial image that can be viewed synchronically. Book 8 of the Aeneid ends with the hero wondering at the scenes depicted on the shield Vulcan has crafted for him. “Ignorant of the subject matter (rerum ignarus) he delights in the image, hoisting on his shoulder the fame and the My first opportunity to put together my ideas about this episode came thanks toMary Lefkowitz, who invited me to lead a session of her Wellesley Aeneid course in 2003. In 2008, I presented them again at a conference on ekphrasis hosted by the University of Crete, an occasion made memorable equally by the inspirational quality of the papers and the hospitality of its organizer, Michael Paschalis. Among the speakers at that conference was Michael Putnam. His generous and helpful comments there were but further additions to the longstanding debt I have accumulated to his scholarship and his friendship. Without accusing him of endorsing any of the claims that follow, I would like to dedicate this paper to Michael in gratitude for both. Finally, I was extremely fortunate in the referees Classical Antiquity chose to review this article. They offered an ideal combination of indulgence, rigor, and attention, and whenever I have disregarded their advice, I have certainly done so at my peril. Classical Antiquity.

Aeneas’s ignorance here has received great attention from scholars and become a touchstone for readings of the poem as a whole, particularly for its use of ekphrasis 1. But the book’s final line raises equally significant questions and challenges for an interpretation of the scene. Servius Danielis, who reads facta for fata, although he attests the latter as well, notes that some critics objected to the line as “rather modern” (magis neotericus). The problem is generally taken to be the word play and metonymy involved in using the shield’s subject matter (famamque et fata nepotum) to signify the artifact itself.2 However Vergil’s phrase intensifies the point of this metonymy through another equally striking rhetorical device, oxymoron: the juxtaposition of fama and fata draws attention to the two words’ shared derivation from the verb for speaking, fari 3. While the word fata on its own possesses a metaphorical gravity, particularly from the perspective of Vergil’s audience looking back on stories that have already been realized in history as events, fama itself is notoriously insubstantial and flighty 4. Its presence here recalls that fata too has its roots in a verbal utterance, which is the only ontological status possessed by the “events” on the shield at the moment described in book 8. The oxymoron thus results from giving substance and weight—note the stress on the gesture of lifting—to such utterances, and the larger issue it raises is how words become real 5. For this highly physicalized transition from ekphrasis to narrative begins the process of accomplishing the fata represented on the shield. Aeneas’s return to the battle, which the shield makes possible, leads in turn to the victory on which all of Roman history depends 6. My aim here will be to explore the implications of this oxymoron for another verbal construct, Vergil’s own poem, which at the moment of its reception simultaneously struggles toward material reality in figuring itself as visual object. I will argue that the ekphrasis presents an ambiguous and reversible relationship between image and reality that highlights and interrogates the performative aspect of Vergil’s epic, its ability to intervene in the shaping of reality through its effect 1. See particularly the comments of Lyne 1987: 209: “Aeneas therefore shoulders the burden of his people; but he cannot meantime take heart from a revelation of the future, because for him there is no such revelation. . . . Venus is cheating him almost as much with this ‘image’ as she did with the ‘false images’ he complained of in their meeting in Book 1 (1.407f.). . . . The pictures on the shield in fact mean one thing to us, another to Aeneas.” 2. So Conington and Nettleship 1883: 151. 3. See Paschalis 1997: 287. 4. “Such a volatile, windy, fickle thing,” Hardie 2012: 9. Hardie, who reads the conjunction in this line as “[binding fama and fata] even more tightly,” nevertheless sees the import of the image as challenged by other representations of fama in the poem (104). On the spokenness of fata, see the seminal discussion of Commager 1980. 5. Hardie 1986: 372–75 suggests that this gesture recalls Atlas and presents this allusion as an element in the analogy between shield and cosmos. 6. So Putnam 1998: 167: “We find ourselves poised at the crucial intersection in the narrative. Art, and the presumably digressive ekphrasis which tells of it, is on the point of yielding to a resumption of the narrative, to a detailing of the lived world of experience.” </page> <page sequence="3"> feldherr: Viewing Myth and History on the Shield of Aeneas 283 on its audience. The self-referential function I am describing emerges mostly from three sets of unstable oppositions manifested respectively in the poem’s imagery, its narratological aspects, and its generic positioning. Since it will be difficult entirely to disarticulate discussion of these three dimensions of the passage, I spell out the central oppositions here: 1) On the level of imagery, the representation of rivers on the shield creates a series of similarities and contrasts between the textual unit of the book and the material image. 2) In narratological terms, Aeneas’s role as a viewer of the shield enables the audience of Vergil’s poem to identify their perspective with his own, but also to differentiate the two 7. The relationship between the represented spectator and the reader gains further emphasis, and further complexity, from the presence of another level of internal spectators on the image itself. These spectators are ontologically more distant from the poem’s audience than Aeneas, since they are but figures on a representation (the shield) within a representation (the poem), and yet temporally closer to them (the last such spectator is Augustus viewing the triumph in 29 bce). 3) The presentation of the shield invites comparison between epic poetry and history, a genre that claims to offer representations of true events. Yet the shield not only brings together epic legend and the realities of history, it also destabilizes those distinctions: the most distant and fabulous events are described with greater verisimilitude than recent history. Taken together, these three facets of the episode sketch a poetic claim to overcome the chasm separating the epic representation of myth from reality. This claim involves both the poem’s representational ability to make myth seem real and its own entrance into history at the moment of its reception. Vergil at once highlights the capacities of his chosen medium in relation to competing forms of representation, especially historical narrative, and reminds his audience that the miraculous translation of image to reality hinges on their own participation. I. Depictions of rivers play a complex role in articulating the structure of book 8. The first scene to receive significant development in the book—arguably the Aristotelian beginning of its own plot—features the apparition of the river Tiber to the sleeping Aeneas (8.31–34). The final scene on the shield, the book’s last major episode, shows us representations of Eastern rivers imagined as depicted in Augustus’s triumph (8.726–28).8 The figure regarding the shield is himself, we remember, located beside a river (egelido secretum flumine, 8.610). The ekphrastic description of the shield echoes the book as a whole in being framed by depictions of rivers, indeed by the very same rivers, the Tiber and, since 7. The two levels of audience thus literally instantiate the superimposition of “focalizations” decisively described by Fowler 1990. 8. Also noted by Quint 1993: 31. </page> <page sequence="4"> 284 classical antiquity Volume 33/No. 2 /October 2014 its ending coincides with the end of the book, the conquered Eastern rivers de- scribed above. The first set of scenes, describing the early history of Rome up until the Gallic sack, includes two events involving the Tiber: Cocles’ destruc- tion of the bridge and Cloelia’s daring swim to freedom (8.650–51). And the river’s presence may be fairly detected in what is both historically and in the order of the narrative the first episode presented, the nursing of Romulus and Remus in the cave of the Lupercal (8.630), located in relative proximity to the Tiber and the spot where the twins themselves washed up from its flood wa- ters. This starting point for the ekphrastic description may also suggest the Tiber as an “absent presence,” the site of the omitted prior episode when the twins were found.9 Initially the double framing of the shield and the book by rivers may suggest a parallelism between this section of the poem and the artifact it depicts, a further manifestation of the approximation of words to objects. At another level, this pattern sets the two modes and levels of representation in opposition. On the one hand the river frame assimilates the book as a whole to an object represented in space by designating its boundary. But not only are the Euphrates and Araxes half a world apart from the Tiber, their topographic separation also possesses a temporal dimension. The Tiber stands at the origins of Roman history, whether we think of those origins in terms of Aeneas or Romulus. This combination of physical proximity and temporal distance is reversed when we come to the final pair, the Araxes and the Euphrates, which carry the shield’s Roman story to the narrative present, and beyond, as Roman history finally touches, and, via the bridge, surpasses, the limits of the Homeric cosmos 10. Attention to the placement of rivers therefore suggests a tension which will be important later in the discussion between a synchronic reception of the image as a whole, as a visual representation, and an awareness of temporal progress and change. This diachronicity applies both to the contents of the narrative, the entire course of Roman history arranged “in order” (8.629), and to the linear narrative form of the poem in which it is presented. The tension approaches paradox if we consider that it is specifically the linear presentation of the poem that the rivers frame as if it were an image. By contrast the rivers do not provide a border for the shield. The Tiber must be near its edge 11, but the Araxes appears as part of the scene in its center. The actual image therefore is re- articulated as narrative, and our expectation of circularity, based on the framing 9. Vergil has indeed just reminded us of the possibility of such omitted scenes by highlighting the selectivity of the narrative (fecerat et, 8.630). On this phrase, see especially Zetzel 1996: 314. 10. For the Caspian Sea, into which the Araxes flows, as a component of Ocean, see Hu ̈bner 1968: 105, citing Mela 3.40–45, who in turn refers to a discussion in Nepos. 11. It cannot be on the top, which is occupied by the scene of the Gallic sack (8.652), or on the bottom (Tartarus, assuming hinc procul, 8.666 implies a diametrically opposite position), and the middle is occupied by the battle of Actium (8.675). For the arrangement of scenes, see West 1975–76: 2–3. </page> <page sequence="5"> feldherr: Viewing Myth and History on the Shield of Aeneas 285 function of the river of Ocean on the shield of Achilles, makes this effect all the more noticeable 12. So far we have seen that representations of rivers, verbally and visually, create an ambiguity about the relationship between narrative and image: the text becomes iconic while the image is narrativized. The rivers thus animate precisely the paradox suggested in the last line of the poem as words do and do not become things. Even this blurring of the properties of the text and the image has a framing counterpart at the start of the ekphrasis in the much-discussed “un-narratable construct of the shield” (clipei non enarrabile textum, 8.625). Here the claim that the shield cannot be narrated, whether that applies to its indescribable splendor, the inherent distance between poetry and the visual arts, or to the complexity and comprehensiveness of its narrative content, highlights Vergil’s miraculous performance of this transition from image to word just as the book’s final lines figure the reverse transformation of words to material images. Of course this phrase can suggest many interpretations of the image that pull in precisely the opposite direction: weaving was already available as a metaphor for literary “artifacts” and thus the shield could already be a text 13, and its indescribability in words could signal Vergil’s inevitable failure to capture the image in poetry rather than amplifying his remarkable success. But the very instability of the phrase’s meaning parallels the effect of the river frame in establishing an oscillation between the perception of narrative and artifact. Another image adds to the structural patterns demarcated by rivers. As the first step in his construction of the shield, Vulcan makes solid metal flow in streams: fluit aes rivis aurique metallum vulnificusque chalybs vasta fornace liquescit. 8.445–46 This sentence, itself framed by verbs for liquidmotion, creates further ring patterns within the text by anticipating both the final image on the shield and the final line of the book. Vulcan reappears as the “softening” god Mulciber at 8.725, and the process of softening receives further attention in the description of one of the Eastern rivers in the shield’s final tableau as “going more softly,” with emphasis too on its liquid form (Euphrates ibat iammollior undis, 8.726).14 In relation to the book’s final line, Vergil lends a sense of the miraculous to Vulcan’s liquefaction of metal through highlighting the military uses of hard steel (vulnificus chalybs). So the book ends with a depiction of the object Vulcan makes being taken up by 12. Jones 2005: 72 suggests a similar framing of the Homeric ekphrasis to match the shield of Achilles itself: the reference to Ocean forms a textual ring by recalling the mention of the sea at the start of the description (18.483).

The motion from hardness to softness at the shield’s construction is answered by an emphasis on its material mass as it is about to be put to use, as well as by the conversion of words to things suggested in its denotation as fama and fata. These additional intratextual rings further entwine image and narrative by establishing that the image itself possesses a story. The shield’s story begins when Vulcan forges it and reaches a (provisional) ending at the moment when it is “received” by Aeneas. I draw attention to the word received because it has both a literal dimension (Aeneas has taken up the shield as his own) and a more figurative one (this is the moment when he interprets or responds to the shield). This new diachronic aspect of the artifact gives significance to the opposition between hardness and softness and relates it to the overlapping structural patterns of circles and lines. The softening in the shield’s final episode happens when a sign wrought in metal is interpreted as a river. This recognition in turn confirms the direction of the linear narrative of Roman history depicted on the image. No wonder the Euphrates becomes soft as it goes (ibat).15 Attention to the liquid substance of rivers thus reveals a powerfully physical dimension to the act of interpretation that links it to the sensory perception of reality and so may be said to bring the shield more directly to life. There are many ways of making rivers look like they are moving on works of art, but fluidity belongs to real rivers in a way that it does not to pictures of rivers. My argument about how the representation of rivers obscured the difference between image and narrative depended on their placement within the text. It thus pre- sumed a consciousness of the text as having the spatial dimensions of a visual image. However the softening that occurs when the shield’s rivers are recog- nized suggests the crossing of another threshold and seems to convert the image in turn into the reality it represents 16. As words gain the material presence of the shield they describe, so the shield is apprehended as the water depicted on its surface. The story of the shield from creation to reception concludes with the audi- ence’s imagination softening and setting in motion the rivers that the god’s craft has made hard and permanent; this suggests a satisfying symmetry in the poem’s account of artistic production. Reality becomes representation under the artist’s hand and then comes to be seen as real again at the moment of reception. The shield’s history from this perspective conforms to its own emphatic circularity (orbibus orbes / impediunt, 8.448–49), just as its function as image makes Roman history take on a circular form. The relationship between artist and audience configured by this model of artistic production and reception at once empowers and subordinates the hu- 15. I owe this point to the comments of an anonymous reader on an earlier version of this paper. 16. For a similar analysis of how the first scene on the shield also makes the shield transparent to the reality it represents, see Putnam 1998: 120. </page> <page sequence="7"> feldherr: Viewing Myth and History on the Shield of Aeneas 287 man recipient of the image. The viewer completes the god’s work and thereby receives a perspective on events not otherwise available. This participation of audience and maker in constructing the shield also emerges from a distinctive feature of Vergil’s ekphrasis that has received comment since Lessing (Laokoon, ch. 18). Where Homer narrates the scenes depicted on Achilles’ shield at the moment of its creation, Vergil defers any description of the content of Aeneas’s shield until the moment of its viewing 17. Therefore the presence of the Home- ric intertext itself superimposes a memory of the act of making on the moment of viewing, just as it recalls the origins of Vergil’s written description in its Homeric exemplar. But reception is made to summon up creation in another way as well, for the reader if not the imagined viewer: pluperfect verbs refer- ring back to Vulcan’s crafting of the shield punctuate transitions in the poem’s account of the events on the shield (fecerat, 8.628, 8.710; extuderat, 8.665; finxerat, 8.726). The reader therefore becomes aware of the narrative of the artifact and the narrative on the artifact simultaneously thanks to this contin- ual reminder that an act of divine making inevitably stands before this act of human viewing. This balancing of the perception of the history of Rome with the history of the shield, both of which possess divine origins, suggests again how beholding the shield as coming to life can coincide with an awareness of it as an artifact and that both can be manifestations of divinity 18. That this ef- fect emerges only through the poet’s narrative may point to another aspect of incompleteness in Aeneas’s perception of the shield. As the Augustan audience knows the history of events, so it also knows the history of the shield itself thanks to the view Vergil has provided of Vulcan’s workshop. But perhaps this narratological effect offers only a faint glimpse to the poet’s audience of what Aeneas was experiencing directly. The reader senses the presence of the di- vinity when the shield is further converted into words, but Aeneas sees Venus face to face. This analysis of how the rivers of bronze become bronze rivers has already suggested two themes that will be treated more explicitly in the next section of the argument: the relationship between viewers within the narrative and the audience of that narrative, and the contrast between divine and human perspectives on the shield and the history it describes. But before leaving Vulcan’s forge, it is important to recognize that the synthetic reading of the image simultaneously as object and narrative has some competition from different ways of telling the story of the shield’s making and reception. For example, in place of beginning the account of the shield with its hardening, we can carry its history back one stage 17. As Feeney 1986: 74 notes, this is one of several points in which Vergil’s shield resembles the Hesiodic Shield of Hercules. But the presence of an alternative intertext does not diminish the significance of comparison with Achilles’ shield as well. For another reading of the effect of this shift from an account of making to an account of reading/viewing, see Putnam 1998: 168–69. 18. For the creation of animated images as distinctive of Hephaestus’s divine art, see Faraone 1992: 18–26. </page> <page sequence="8"> 288 classical antiquity Volume 33/No. 2 /October 2014 further. Perhaps the initial moment of making the shield should be described not as turning molten metal hard but rather hard steel molten; the perception of the rivers as flowing, if that represents the way they are seen on the shield, thus suggests a parallelism, perhaps even rivalry, between maker and viewer rather than complementarity and sequentiality. The maker’s action begins not with giving things the form that they have in reality (steel really is hard) but altering their defining qualities, and the audience’s re-animation of the image as part of a story involves a similar imposition of human, vital characteristics on cold metal images (notice that the Euphrates’ softening and motion both open the door to personification). The transition between creation and reception now potentially enacts a re- lationship of repression and resistance rather than a stable and mutually beneficial hierarchy. Indeed the emphasis on Vulcan as the agent of the shield’s creation may already be the result of a perceptible Vergilian revision of its early history. When the image is described, Vulcan’s knowledge and craftsmanship appear as its source (haud vatum ignarus . . . fecerat, 8.627–28) but in the actual description of the shield’s forging there is no mention of any divine design and the “making” is done by the Cyclopes. The physical effort involved appears in the famously mimetic line illi inter sese multa vi bracchia tollunt (8.452), where Vergil’s poem appears not to mirror divine vision but to echo Cyclopean labor. And references to labor (8.439, 8.444) as well as the emphasis on the verb tollere (8.439) further depict the process of making as work performed in response to divine command. With this language in mind, the ring that links the ekphrasis’s conclusion to its narrative beginnings appears less when the viewer recognizes Mulciber’s craft in seeing image as reality, than when Aeneas mimics the Cyclopes in lifting on his shoulders the burden imposed by the gods (attollens umero, 8.731 brac- chia tollunt, 8.452). For the servants of the divinity, only the weight of the shield matters. II. Vergil’s depiction of internal spectators also mediates the transition from representation to reality. Many narratological analyses of Roman poetry have made use of the concept of internal focalization, where figures within a narrative provide perspectives for interpreting it while also available to be interpreted themselves 19. Such internal perspectives can enhance the reality effect of the literary illusion by encouraging the reader to view events as if a participant in them. But they can also prompt the recognition of distance, as those viewers are themselves perceived as representations. Thus Vergil’s represented viewers have an effect similar to that achieved by the placement of rivers in activating different 19. For the most helpful (of many) theoretical accounts of levels of focalization within a narrative, see Bal 2009: 160–63. </page> <page sequence="9"> feldherr: Viewing Myth and History on the Shield of Aeneas 289 degrees of awareness of the text as reality 20. Furthermore these internal spectators appear within the ekphrasis on varying planes of representation. Aeneas’s final gaze at the shield makes him such a figure, but numerous individuals represented within the ekphrasis also provide internal focalization. Porsenna expresses a powerful reaction to events and is simultaneously available to be seen (aspiceres, 8.650). Cleopatra is seen (videbatur, 8.707), but herself fails to see the serpents approaching her (necdum . . . respicit, 8.697). By contrast, Apollo does behold the divine manifestations present in the battle (cernens, 8.704) and is one of them. And, in a climactic position at the end of the description, Augustus is located in the visual environment of contemporary Rome, framed indeed by the temple of the last divine viewer (niveo candentis limine Phoebi, 8.720), while responding to the offerings displayed in the spectacle of the triumph (dona recognoscit populorum, 8.721). The two levels of viewers allow this reality effect to work in relation to the shield itself (if we view as Aeneas), and to the historical events of the shield’s narrative (if we view from the perspectives made available within the ekphrasis). The multiplication of perspectives also complicates audience response by allowing for the adoption of divergent points of view on the same event, such as Cleopatra’s or Apollo’s on the battle of Actium, and by inviting speculation about how Aeneas responds to the possibilities of absorption and distance offered by viewers at a more distant level of representation. In this section of the discussion, I will use the relationship among internal spectators to examine how the alternatives constructed for viewing the shield as reality or representation correspond to different attitudes and perspectives on the events described. So far I have treated the figure of the internal spectator as accomplishing in terms of the text’s narratological architecture what river imagery does on the level of content. But the relationship between the two is much more complex than that. Often the viewing figures are themselves looking at rivers. This was true both outside the frame of the ekphrasis, when the Tiber was seen by Aeneas (visus, 8.33), and on the shield itself: Porsenna’s indignation is aroused by events that take place on the river Tiber, and Augustus’s acknowledgement of the dona populorum immediately precedes the parade of conquered rivers that concludes the triumph.21 Indeed figures viewing rivers become as conspicuous within the patterning of the text as the rivers themselves, offering a structure for mapping the dimensions of the book as icon that parallels the mapping function of the rivers. And if, as I suggested in the last section, the river imagery also tracks a course from the shield as image to the real presence of what the shield depicts, 20. Boyd 1995 provides another important parallel for considering how the perspectives of internal viewers elide the boundaries between narrative and description and so introduce an element of indeterminacy into the interpretation of the image. 21. A river himself appears as an internal focalizer when the Nile responds to the Egyptian defeat at Actium by summoning the losers to hide in his own streams (8.712–13, as perhaps the Tiber was responding to Aeneas’s anxieties by appearing to him, cf. curas his demere dictis, 8.35). </page> <page sequence="10"> 290 classical antiquity Volume 33/No. 2 /October 2014 the figure of the viewer similarly plots the progression between different levels of representation. The book takes us from a representation of a man looking at a river (Aeneas at the Tiber), to a representation of a man (Aeneas) looking at a representation of a man (Augustus) looking at rivers; a figure who had been a literary “reflection” (a man looking at a river) at once steps closer to the position of the poem’s readers in assuming their role as spectator and seems to retreat further as we are reminded of his actual status as representation by seeing it “mirrored” in the similar figure on the shield (Augustus). Another passage even closer to the book’s beginning combines an attention to viewing with a description of a visual object that in many ways looks forward to the shield itself:22 the simile comparing Aeneas’s contemplation of his military situation (cuncta videns, 8.19) to the flickering of light off a basin of water. Though no rivers are mentioned, water here forms at once a part of the substance of what the audience sees (aquae is the first word of the simile, 8.22), and the receptive transformer of other visual images, the light that it reflects onto the coffered ceiling. Aeneas and his audience are seeing in tandem, he “all the events in Latium,” but not the basin, while the “reflection” of water at once replaces and represents the image of a man “seeing 23.” The scene thus further confirms the importance of descriptions of vision for both the structure and significance of the book to come, and it provides what I will argue is a programmatic account of the potentialities of viewing that govern the ekphrasis as well. The points of resemblance between the basin and the shield may be extended beyond its designation as an image in proximity of a man viewing. The material elements that make up the basin, water and metal, respond both to the shield’s representation of water (e.g., the watery plain at Actium, maris . . . imago, 8.671), and to the exchange between liquid and solidmetal thatmarks the shield’s creation. Here, however, the water and the metal are kept distinct from one another rather than merging into a single image as they do at the shield’s forging when metal is perceived as liquid, and in the Actium description, where the “image of the sea” is itself golden (aurea, 8.672). The other element of the simile that recalls the description of the shield is of course light. Within the simile, light traces a vertical path as it moves from the sun and moon to the basin and then “is raised up” again (erigitur, 8.25) to strike the height of the roof (summi). Presumably the imagined spectator of this scene hints at another descent as the beam of light returns to his eyes, allowing the reflection to be seen. In this way the light provides an image of reflection itself as its manifestations carry it by stages from its original source in the celestial 22. imagine lunae, 8.23 imagine gaudet, 8.730. The designation of the shield as imago, and the responsion between these two occurrences gain prominence because these are only two of four appearances of the word within the book. The other two, at 8.557 and 8.671, will be discussed in the next section. 23. aenis, 8.22, identifies Aeneas who was described outside the simile with the circumlocution Laomedontius heros, 8.18. </page> <page sequence="11"> feldherr: Viewing Myth and History on the Shield of Aeneas 291 bodies to the basin, the ceiling, and the eye. Light also makes the simile itself a “mirror” for the action it describes because it provides the “vehicle” that most nearly describes its “tenor”: the light conveys the swift motion of his mind, rising from the basin as the thoughts do from his “sea of cares” (curarum fluctuat aestu, 8.19). That image of light further links the simile to the ekphrasis by recalling the many forms of brilliance described when Aeneas first receives the armor (arma . . . radiantia, 8.616; galeam flammasque vomentem, 8.620; loricam . . . qualis cum caerula nubes / solis inardescit radiis longeque refulget, 8.621–23). His insatiable gazing and “turning” (versat, 8.619) of the individual elements of his panoply (per singula, 8.618) echo the turning of his thoughts through all the aspects of his dilemma (per omnia versat, 8.21). Within the arming scene this pattern of light begins with the “brilliant” goddess Venus herself (aetherios inter dea candida nimbos, 8.608). There light imagery appears as a sign of the divine presence, as indeed brilliant light does often accompany epiphany in ancient accounts 24. And the goddess’s first appearance in the clouds approximates the celestial position of the original sources of light within the simile, the sun and moon, so that the motifs of verticality within the imagery are also available to be read as signs of divine appearance.25 Indeed the simile itself ushers in, and reflects, another “mirroring” epiphany as the god Tiber appears to Aeneas rising up from the surface of the water rather than down from the clouds (populeas inter senior se attollere frondes, 8.32). The representation of viewing in this scene therefore prepares for the in- terpretation of the ekphrasis in several ways. It directs attention to the ten- sion between Aeneas’s vision and that of the audience. Its imagery antici- pates the possibility for the surface of the image to open up vertical path- ways between man and divinity. But it also presents this epiphanic effect of viewing as not always available to all viewers. The image appears only as part of the poetic description, not within the reality the poem describes. By contrast, the mind of Aeneas moves only laterally, here and there (nunc huc . . . nunc . . . illuc, 8. 20) in various directions (in partisque . . . varias, 8.21). Geographically his reflections are perhaps only as “wide” as Latium itself, and they remain fixed in the linear process of the plot, what has happened and what to do about it. For the reader, the contemporary detail of the cof- fered ceiling, contrasting with the open heavens above Aeneas, confines the image within the simile to his own times 26. As the description of the basin too remains purely material, with no reference to any lurking divine pres- 24. On the “hallucination of light” as itself a sign of epiphany, see Versnel 1987: 53. 25. Especially given Eden’s suggestion that the appearance of Venus figures the rise of another celestial light source, the evening star (1975: 160). 26. Cf. Seneca, Ep. 90. 42, where the coffered ceiling as a symbol of modern luxury contrasts with the sight of heavens available in more primitive times. </page> <page sequence="12"> 292 classical antiquity Volume 33/No. 2 /October 2014 ences, so Vergil’s poetic procedure does not exploit the illusionistic blurring of image and representation that feature in the shield description. Tenor re- mains tenor and vehicle vehicle with no sense that the characters within the text view the described image, or that the reader entertains the perspective of the character. An emphasis on the similarities between the basin and the shield therefore highlights the potential of the latter image to convey the real presence of divinities. At the same time, however, the opening scene differs significantly from the account of the shield because it keeps separate precisely the opposites whose fusion distinguishes the ekphrasis: liquid and solid, god and man, and most importantly, the perspectives of the poem’s audience and the internal spectator. But this is only the beginning of the book, and the rivers that have guided our reading so far can mark linear progress as well as acting as a frame.27 As Aeneas travels up the river about to appear to him, he will learn to see traces of divinity in a remarkable number of humble places like the wilderness of the Capitoline and the hut of Evander. So too the poem by juxtaposing the basin and the shield stakes out its own course from description to epiphanic vehicle. A recognition of the trajectory between the book’s first image and its last also allows for a relativization of the much-described distance between viewer and audience at the book’s conclusion. Aeneas’s ignorance of the subject matter of the shield must be balanced against the fact that he is there at least seeing the image itself. Rather than emphasizing the difference between what he perceives and what the reader knows, we can see a process of assimilation between the internal and external perspectives contrasting with the basin simile which located Aeneas and the reader firmly within their own historical moments. Furthermore, the imagery of light begins a process of composing the text itself as a visual image, offering the possibility for perceiving it from outside the progress of its narrative. Representations of light connect distinct moments within the book’s narrative: its inception, the arming scene, and the brilliance of particular images on the shield 28. They can therefore be read together as illuminating one another across the linear dimensions of the book. So on the shield itself resemblances between the visual characteristics of scenes, especially those involving height and brightness, will draw together events from different ages of Roman history. With the lessons of the basin about different levels of viewing in mind, I want now to pay closer attention to the perspectives of the spectators within the 27. Cf. DuBois 1982: 31–32 on how the three main ekphrases in the poem form a similarly linear sequence extending from past to future. 28. The description of the waves and forest wondering at “far gleaming shields” (fulgentia longe scuta) and “painted ships” (pictas carinas) as the Trojan fleet travels miraculously up the Tiber (8.91–93) also forms part of this pattern. Language and imagery anticipate both the shield of Aeneas as object and the account of the luminous naval battle at its center. Since the description of the ships in the ekphrasis itself foreshadows Aeneas’s nautical return to the Trojan camp (10.261), Aeneas’s fleet seems to voyage back and forth between reality and representation. </page> <page sequence="13"> feldherr: Viewing Myth and History on the Shield of Aeneas 293 ekphrasis. My aim will be to correlate these perspectives with the interpretative options set forth in section one for viewing the shield as a visual object as opposed to verbal narrative. This connection between the narrative’s representational ambiguities and the responses of internal viewers will confirm the importance of the formal problems of differentiating word and image, and image and reality; it will also give these issues some ideological content. For the viewers within the ekphrasis possess distinctive identities that together draw attention to essential oppositions between god and human, between Roman and non-Roman, and between man and woman. And each category of viewer develops a specific way of seeing. Connecting viewing strategies with particular hierarchical positions, historical figures, and national identities will link the formal arguments in the first portion of the paper with the specific effects of “viewing” Vergil’s shield in comparison to other actual and represented spectacles in Augustan Rome. As I have described, the divine Apollo is able to perceive the actions of divinities (haec cernens, 8.704). At the same instant he also seems to be viewing events from another plane, for haec can signify at once the divinities themselves and the images of these divinities. Thus in seeing the gods he also seems to be seeing the shield from outside. Indeed the next line describes Apollo looking down and drawing his bow “from above” (desuper, stressed by enjambment), placing him perhaps above the plane of the shield as well as above the ships of the Egyptians within the image. By contrast, Cleopatra, in addition to being foreign and female is emphatically mortal: “she grows pale at death” (pallentem morte futura, 8.709).29 The standard printing of morte without capitalization suggests a general perception that she, differently from Apollo and the shield’s viewer, sees death not as a divine personification but as an immediate human reality. A similar set of oppositions structures the possibilities offered for viewing the represented characters themselves: a set of paired apostrophes (8.643 and 8.668) identifies the traitors Catiline and Mettus as negative exempla precisely by addressing them from beyond the frame of the narrative. Our looking in on them from the outside contrasts their position as spectacle to Apollo’s location in the viewer’s space at the battle of Actium. Similarly Augustus stands out on and stands outside of the shield thanks to the brilliant gleam from his head, a description that evokes the very helmet Aeneas receives at this moment in the poem’s main narrative (tempora flammas / laeta vomunt, 8.680–81; galeam flammasque vomentem, 8.620). But as Augustus crosses the boundary of the image by simultaneously becoming like Aeneas and anticipating the divine Apollo, another character within the temporal sequence of the narrative, Agrippa, is distinguished by his own resemblance to him. If his lieutenant does not attain quite the same heights as Augustus (celsa, 8.680) or Apollo (desuper, 8.705) he remains nonetheless upright (arduus, 8.683). His temples also shine, not with 29. The line also connects her with Dido, described as pallida morte futura (4.644). See, e.g., Eden 1975: 189, and the discussion by Heffernan 1993: 34. </page> <page sequence="14"> 294 classical antiquity Volume 33/No. 2 /October 2014 miraculous flames, nor with a divine helmet, but thanks to insignia bestowed by Augustus (tempora navali fulgent rostrata corona, 8.684).30 This further stage of resemblance translates a superhuman brilliance that seemingly transcends history back to a sequence of imitations ordered by social and temporal hierarchies. In the conclusion of this section I will focus on two particular distinctions in represented perspectives, those that separate humans from divinities, and those that separate Romans from non-Romans, and on scenes where the objects of vision are rivers or possess characteristics that relate them to rivers. In the first section, I argued that rivers both constitute the ekphrastic object by defining it and expand its parameters by suggesting how the poem can be visualized as an object bordered by streams. Rivers similarly thematize the “flow” from representation to reality. Thus by concentrating on how viewers see rivers we will gain a more precise awareness of how Vergil characterizes alternative responses to his text. As we have discussed, the vertical dimension of perspective draws attention to the axis between human and divine. This vertical dimension can refer both to the representation of up and down within the image (things that are “high,” celsa, like Augustus, 8.680, or the Capitoline, 8.653, point to divine presences) as well as to viewing from above and outside the planar surface of the image itself, as I have suggested Apollo views Actium. Indeed the slippage between these two manifestations of height helps accomplish the confusion of representation and reality by moving the two-dimensional image into our own three-dimensional space, and vice versa. So too over the course of the book the vertical transmission of light presented in the programmatic basin simile has gained significance as a manifestation of divinity. Reading the aqueous surface of that basin in contrast to the backward glance at the shield and book as defined by the representation of rivers reveals not simply that the view of the shield makes divine action immanent to the viewer, which is obvious enough, nor that the perception of divinity comes from this downward glance at the image as a whole. It rather suggests a dynamic transition between a human perspective seeing gods from below and access to the position fromwhich divinities view human action. For to recognize the Araxes and Euphrates as the rivers framing the ekphrasis as a cosmic icon opens a perspective that precisely balances the nearer view of reflection as a mark of epiphany implicit in the basin simile: from that earlier vantage one looks down on water as it meets human eyes, in tiny fragments like the basin, and yet these aqueous fragments can literally make the divine apprehensible 31. By contrast, looking at a map reveals the whole earth as it is never actually available to the gaze of any human. Thus in the “basin” of the shield we see how gods appear to men, but transforming the shield to 30. For another interpretation of the resemblance between Augustus and Agrippa as an instance of the “twin” motif in the shield, see Putnam 1998: 122. 31. For another way of thinking about the representational process involved in this reflection, cf. the comments of Putnam 1988: 166 on the “synecdochic” relationship between the events described by the poem itself and the entire sweep of Roman history. </page> <page sequence="15"> feldherr: Viewing Myth and History on the Shield of Aeneas 295 a map allows us to see the humanworld as the gods see it. This transition correlates divine viewing with adopting a perspective on the shield as a synchronous visual image, and seeing that image as reality rather than representation. The distinctiveness of this perspective becomes clearer when we turn our attention back to the “horizontal” dimension of viewing, that of characters who see only events contemporary to them. Two such characters immediately claim our attention, Porsenna and Cleopatra. The contrast with the view from above becomes all the more striking since both of these figures are defined as viewers in relation to rivers, which they see as near or distant in space, that is, from within the plane of the shield. In the case of Porsenna (8.649–51), the reader “would see (aspiceres) him like one resenting an injury to his dignity and like one threatening because Cocles had dared to pull down the bridge and Cloelia, her bonds broken, had swum the river.” The two events Porsenna sees take place along the river that separates his camp from Rome. The position of these episodes, so near in historical time and so relatively close along the course of the Tiber, connects Porsenna’s perspective simultaneously with chronological and geographic limitations. If within the structure of the ekphrasis the Tiber forms part of a symbolic vector connecting Rome’s origins with her conquest of the world, Porsenna sees only a fragment of its extent 32. And while he may not be aware of the temporal limitations of his own power in relation to Rome, he certainly understands how the deeds of Cocles and Cloelia differentiate him from the Romans in regard to rivers as boundaries: Cocles keeps him from crossing the Tiber, while Cloelia shows that the Romans can cross it. In contrast to Porsenna, Vergil’s readers, by virtue of their assimilation to viewers of the shield through the narrator’s aspiceres, adopt the superior position of spectators gazing on the image from without. They can also exploit their own actual position at a moment when Rome has the crossing of the distant Araxes in view to put the geographical scale of events at the Tiber in a very different perspective from how they seemed to Porsenna. Combining the points of view of reader and viewer, therefore, they are able to perceive Porsenna as part of the whole story of their history, and also to “place” him on the shield by his resemblance to figures from different parts of the image: similemque minanti “resembles” the description of the rock on which Catiline hangs in the underworld as minaci (8.668); indignanti similem recalls the Araxes river itself described as indignatus (8.728).33 Yet it is important to note that Vergil introduces several significant qualifi- cations to this general delineation of the reader as viewer. First the verb aspiceres 32. See Quint 1993: 30: “The river, the Heraclitean emblem of flux, further redefines the imperial enterprise as the conquest not merely of space but of time.” 33. Cf. Putnam’s discussion (1998: 127–28) of how Vergil highlights Porsenna’s double status as image and reality as part of his construction of the audience as viewers. </page> <page sequence="16"> 296 classical antiquity Volume 33/No. 2 /October 2014 is a potential subjunctive in a counterfactual statement. The reader cannot see Porsenna, but could see him, if he were able either to behold the shield, or if he had been present at the time, but of course neither alternative is possible. So too Porsenna may at once seem to enable and prevent the reader’s visualizing the far more significant and pictorially interesting events that took place along the Tiber itself: we may imagine that they were present on the shield, but here the focus on Porsenna within the narrative has blocked our access to the image. In a similar way the chiastically repeated word similem makes Porsenna a “mirror” for figures later in the shield but only a partial one. In both cases, it is important to note that the king is compared not to another man but to a feature in a landscape. Closer consideration reveals that the connection with Catiline, though seemingly based on visual resemblance, would not in fact be as available to the viewer of a real shield, where a rock could not resemble the expression of the countenance of a man, as it is to the reader viewing the ekphrasis itself as a visual image. It is the similarity in meaning and the very position of (nearly) identical words on the page that encourage the association, which, since Catiline too threatened to overturn the republic with an invasion from Etruria, can also perhaps be facilitated by the reader’s knowledge of history. The resemblance to the Araxes might be easier to visualize but only if the Araxes is imagined as already personified in the actual depiction of the triumph; if the personification was the work of the poet, this likeness too would be more plausible in the “eyes” of the reader. And even if shared elements of content between the two scenes, images of crossing rivers and indignation, seem to justify the connection, this should not blind us to the strange metamorphosis of a king frustrated at his inability to control the crossing of a river into a river being crossed. All these references to failures of vision and imperfect resemblance make it clear that the act of viewing the shield undergoes a transformation in the course of the ekphrasis. The reader first encountering Porsenna is far from achieving the sight of the shield as image or experiencing the images it depicts as reality. If the barriers separating Vergil’s audience from the ekphrastic object and depicted reality fall away in the course of viewing the shield, or, better, if the reader’s experience of the text becomes an act of seeing in its own right, Porsenna loses his subjectivity and ability to see even as the perspectives of reader and spectator come together. First an agent “ordering” the Romans to restore the Tarquins (iubebat, 8.646, in a scene described with no reference to its actual position on the shield, as though it were any other event in the poem’s narrative), he then becomes not a man expressing threats but merely like one. Next, as the reader perceives the resemblances to the rock, Porsenna is no longer even like a “man.” Finally, when we reach the Araxes, we perceive a scene where the contributions of the poet are hard to disentangle from those of the sculptor. But in contrast to his manifestation beside the Tiber, Porsenna now appears not only as a distant memory but as a less apprehensible image in relation to the river, a reverse simile figuring the indignation of this unreal real presence. His metaphorical absorption </page> <page sequence="17"> feldherr: Viewing Myth and History on the Shield of Aeneas 297 by the river, in contrast to his attempt to control river crossings, figures a process of demonumentalization that, as the description of the shield itself progresses, washes his presence from the image. Cleopatra stands at the opposite end of Roman history from Porsenna. Yet the contrasts between the two figures form a striking pattern. As Porsenna’s response substitutes for an actual description of the Tiber, in the case of Cleopatra there is a real river to be seen, the personified Nile. But there is no sign at all that she sees him beckoning to her. In this case the blindness of the figure within the image in comparison to the viewer of the image reflects less a difference in temporal perspective than a lack of awareness of the immanence of the divine. Cleopatra is back in the position of Aeneas just before the epiphany of the river god Tiber, which he does, however, see. And by this point the viewer too can perceive divine beings directly on the image and not simply adumbrated through their actions, as was the case in the earlier scenes from Roman history (see section III). Cleopatra stands closer to the viewer than Porsenna at the level of representation as well as in terms of historical distance. Whereas “you could have seen Porsenna,” Cleopatra becomes the subject of the verb videbatur. The double meaning of this verb, “was seen” or “seemed,” matches the shift from the subjunctive to the indicative in making her more directly visible. Her “seeming” as a representation to act coincides with an imagined internal spectator perceiving her as “seen 34.” And if Porsenna’s indignation was largely retrospective, looking back to events that had already happened, Cleopatra seems frozen by the ekphrastic imperfect that keeps her from achieving the actions that will bring her salvation. She is just on the point of setting sail and slackening the sheets, but she will never do it. The subjective desires of an imagined “real” Cleopatra are constrained by her becoming an image. This becomes all the more apparent when we remember that the representation here competes with the real historical outcome, for Cleopatra did in fact escape and by her death avoided being displayed in Augustus’s triumph.35 Thus the erasure of Porsenna, as monument merges with text, contrasts with the imagistic freezing of Cleopatra to supplement the historical reality of the triumph in which she could not be seen. These non-Romans viewers of rivers thus define by contrast the position of Vergil’s audience in relation to both the artifact of the shield and the historical events it depicts: Porsenna and Cleopatra’s very appearance within the image seems to objectify them and to limit their own ability to see, whether the actions 34. So also Putnam 1998: 147. 35. Heffernan’s suggestion (1993: 34) that Cleopatra’s position on the shield’s boss together with her accompanying snakes make her the iconic equivalent of an apotropaic Gorgon gives further point to the narrative’s containment of Cleopatra as a spectacle. While the Gorgon was there to inspire terror, Cleopatra feels terror. But the effect of the Gorgon derives also from her being presented frontally so that she gazes back at the spectator: here the narrator simultaneously keeps the queen’s own gaze fixed within the image on the shield and presents her as something to be seen and not seeing. </page> <page sequence="18"> 298 classical antiquity Volume 33/No. 2 /October 2014 of divinity or the full scope of history. They appear as frustrated by the course of events, represented by the rivers that they cannot cross or keep from being crossed, in the case of Porsenna, or seem unable to reach in the case of Cleopatra. But these similarities also strikingly distinguish them from the only Roman on the shield to function as an internal spectator, Augustus 36. He comes ultimately to share the perspective of the god Apollo and even to project a similar appearance as he looks out from the “snowy” threshold of “shining” Phoebus’s temple (8.720). The adjectives and the very epithet of the god (Phoebus) combine to present an image of brightness that subsumes the epiphanic brilliance of all the divine presences in the book and recalls the flames that shone from Augustus’s head on his first depiction at Actium 37. Even at Actium, however, Augustus is never described as seeing or perceiving anything; he is merely a figure on the shield. His moment as spectator comes when he beholds a representation of past events in the form of a triumph. His position therefore resembles that of the shield’s viewer, Aeneas, who is just about to reclaim our attention as the ekphrasis ends. As the objects of Aeneas’s gaze were described as dona (8.609), so Augustus recognizes the “gifts of peoples” (dona populorum, 8.721). But as we shall consider more fully in the next section, Augustus simulta- neously moves closer to the position of Vergil’s own audience, not only because they are also viewing a representation, but because they are viewing that rep- resentation as reality in process, moving images no longer distanced by reminders of the obtruding artifact. And for many of Vergil’s audience the triumph may well have been experienced as reality. The idealized Roman spectator therefore not only watches like a god, and becomes himself a divine image, but he bridges historical distance, from Aeneas to the present, and levels of representation 38. In chronological terms he stands with the contemporary audience, but as a figure on a representation (the shield) within a representation (the poem) he is even more distant than the Trojan hero. The only Roman spectator depicted in the ekphrasis, he unites Aeneas and the real audience in the act of viewing a scene whose affirma- tion of Roman world conquest matches the claims of the shield itself. Hence too the particular significance of the Araxes bridge as an ending point. For not only does the river Araxes mark the farthest point in space represented on the shield, it also reaches up to and beyond the nearest point in time. Roman forces had not yet reached the Araxes, much less bridged it 39. From simply revealing what to 36. Not even the account of the salvation of the Capitoline hill (8.652–62), a narrative whose very outcome depends on an act of perception, places a Roman in the role of a spectator. Manlius is indeed present as a guard (8.652), and Vergil’s description of the Gauls’ armor makes them conspicuous enough. But Manlius never sees them; it is up to the viewer to perform that salvific act. 37. Cf. Heffernan 1993: 35: “In occupying the very spot where the statue of Apollo would stand—the limen of the new temple—Augustus becomes at once a god and an icon.” 38. That Vergil allows his audience to view past events as present forms a major thesis of Rossi’s book on the representation of battle scenes in the poem: see especially Rossi 2004: 125–49. 39. See Gurval 1995: 242–43, who argues for taking the otherwise unattested evidence of Servius (Aen. 8.728) that Augustus restored a bridge on the Araxes built by Alexander as an ex </page> <page sequence="19"> feldherr: Viewing Myth and History on the Shield of Aeneas 299 the poem’s contemporary audience is the Roman past, the shield now reaches the moment at which it is read and incorporates the contemporary spectator within its design as an actor who must translate past history to present accomplishment by bridging the stream 40. If one function of rivers on a shield is to indicate the limits of the image, then the bridge suggest that the final point in the ekphrasis is the place where the boundary of the representational is crossed, where the image becomes reality. III. In the previous section the conversion of image to reality was treated primarily as a cognitive process, a matter of viewing a representation as if what it showed were present. However the final image of Aeneas hoisting the shield on his arm also figures a more active kind of transformation. The transition from ekphrasis to narrative sets the internal viewer on the path to construct the history depicted on the image by taking part in the course of events. Seeing texts or images as real translates into the conversion of reality to match the representation. If our discussion of how the image came to be perceived as real gave precedence to the static, hierarchical, and iconic aspects of the ekphrasis, the explanation of how reality becomes image re-introduces its directional and linear properties. Not only is the ekphrasis made more emphatically part of a narrative by Aeneas’s action, but the poem itself, as I shall argue here, looks forward beyond the point where its representation of the past must necessarily stop to configure the future. For this stage of the argument we will be able to confirm and sharpen our understanding of the claims Vergil makes for the effect of his poem as image by fixing our own gaze outside the text. Other forms of historical representation in Augustan Rome similarly made the depiction of the past performative or protreptic, and Vergil’s ekphrasis explicitly evokes these other media. Most obviously the triumph, which appears on the shield itself and in such a way that the readers’ experience of it approximates that of spectators, could convey a range of messages from specific political propaganda to a comprehensive figuring of Roman history up to the present 41. While the explicit description of a ritual like the triumph, which readers post facto fabrication. Gurval suggests rather that “the bridge . . . is suggestive of the future defeat of this much feared foe and alludes to the bold promise by Caesar Augustus to avenge the shameful defeat of Marcus Crassus.” See also Hu ̈bner 1968: 104. 40. For this whole series of peoples and images as protreptic supplements to the actual triumph, see Gurval 1995: 35. Contra O ̈ stenberg 1999, who however cannot provide corroborating attestation that any of the peoples described by Vergil in fact appeared in the triumph of 29 bce, with the exception of the Morini, the Nile, the Geloni, and (probably) the Euphrates. For the importance of the Araxes in later images of the world as completely pacified by the Romans, see Hu ̈bner 1968: 105, who notes that the crossing of the Araxes could also be linked to the hubristic transgression of boundaries, most strikingly at the end of Herodotus’s first book (1.205–14), where this act prepares for Cyrus’s death at the hands of Tomyris. 41. For the ideological impact of the triumph, see e.g., Holliday 1997: 144–47. The ability of the triumph to place the victory celebrated within a broader historical context comes most obviously </page> <page sequence="20"> 300 classical antiquity Volume 33/No. 2 /October 2014 could have actually experienced, certainly facilitates their ability to see the shield as something more than a literary image, Vergil also links his text to reality by in- voking another form of literary representation, historiography. This genre claimed a closer tie between what it described and what actually happened and made this the basis for its power to change the actions, not just the perceptions, of its viewers. An obvious model for the kind of active intervention in history I am claiming for Vergil’s poem comes from the work of his contemporary Livy. Much recent research on this author has explored the strategies he uses to influence his readers’ conduct through the presentation of history as a visual image. In his preface Livy programmatically connects the way his history intervenes in the lives of his audience and the state with its perception as a monument possessing the visual characteristic of brightness: “This is what is particularly healthful and productive in learning about events, to behold manifestations of every form of example set forth on a brilliant monument whence you may select what to imitate for yourself and your republic and what, foul in its beginnings and result, you should avoid.”42 The reader’s turn from cognition to performance transforms the ideal future republic to an “edited” version of Livy’s own representation of its past, purged of all elements described as foeda and so spared the prospect of decline. But Livy connects this recirculation of historiography into history with his text’s prior ability to give a representation of men and manners 43, the conformance of which to reality contrasts with the unbelievable stories appropriate for poetry (fabulae). And the aspects of these fabulae that receive the greatest attention are their temporal remoteness44 and their depiction of anthropomorphized gods intervening directly in human affairs 45. from the commemoration of the triumph itself through the erection of spolia, the inscribed record of previous triumphs, and the audience’s ability to compare and contrast previous instances of the ritual. McKay 1998 argues for reading the entire shield as a visualization of a triumph: the earlier scenes are depicted as triumphal paintings, and the sites of the city described in the ekphrasis lay along the route of the procession. See also Eigler 1998. Most importantly, O ̈ stenberg 1999 has argued that Vergil’s account closely describes what was actually seen in the triumph of 29 bce: if the peoples and images on the shield make up a composite image of the entire world, she suggests, this reflects not Vergil’s poetic imagination of the event, but just the kind of ideological claim made by triumphing generals themselves. 42. hoc illud est praecipue in cognitione rerum salubre ac frugiferum; omnis te exempli documenta in inlustri posita monumento intueri; inde tibi tuaeque rei publicae quod imitere capias, inde foedum inceptu foedum exitu quod vites (praef . 10). On the visual aspects of Livy’s history see especially Jaeger 1997 and Feldherr 1998. 43. ad illa mihi pro se quisque acriter intendat animum, quae vita, qui mores fuerint, per quos viros quibusque artibus domi militiaeque et partum et auctum imperium sit (praef. 9). 44. quae ante conditam condendamve urbem poeticis magis decora fabulis quam incorruptis rerum gestarum monumentis traduntur (praef . 6). 45. ut cum suum conditorisque sui parentem Martem potissimum ferat (praef . 7). Livy’s own attitude toward this material is notoriously problematic since he seems simultaneously to justify its inclusion in his narrative and to differentiate it from proper historiography.

J. Woodman rightly observed that the general description of the shield’s contents alludes to written history as a genre in its reference to wars fought “in order” (pugnataque in ordine bella, 8.629).46 He interprets Vergil’s historiographic gesture as a riposte precisely to Livy’s programmatic distinction between history and fabulae that involve gods in human events like the founding of cities. We can use this starting point to consider further how Vergil’s ekphrasis relates the human events of history to his own “fabulous” narratives of the gods. As we saw, Livy locates the material more suitable for fabulae in the farthest past, before the city was founded (praef. 6), and this sets in motion a process of progressive historicization, as milestones in the events of Roman history make the written record of it more historiographic and less poetic 47. Thus Roman history acquires its distinctive annalistic structure and chronology (cf. in ordine) only after the foundation of the republic, at the beginning of Livy’s second book (2.1.1). An even more decisive change comes at the end of the first pentad, with the restoration of the city after the sack by the Gauls, after which Livy explicitly claims that the events he recounts from then on will be clariora and certiora (clearer and more certain) since the records for what went before had been destroyed (6.1.3). This Livian image of Roman history as slowly emerging into the light of apprehensibility also helps structure Vergil’s ekphrasis. Vergil begins with events from that shadowy period near the beginning of the city’s foundation, when the absence of the consulate precludes an annalistic ordo. Yet when we look at the scenes themselves, they are as scrupulously historical as any rationalizing historian could have made them. While every event may well remind the reader of the omnipresence of divine favor in Roman history, nowhere in these early scenes are the gods directly represented. Rather they are manifest even to the characters within the image only through the kinds of cult practices that were very much the business of human history, temples and sacred spots, sacrifices, and prodigies. They are equivalent to the “basin” perhaps in showing how divine action appears within a human frame of reference. Indeed we might say that the first line of the narrative, fecerat et viridi fetam Mavortis in antro (8.630) programmatically expunges any offensively “fabulous” accounts of the divine. For Vulcan is said to have shown not the offspring of Mars (fetam not fetum Mavortis), nor some miraculous animal messenger of Mars, since the genitive does not govern the fetam lupam, but simply the sacred cave of Mars.48 Vergil’s choice to end his account of early Roman history with the Gallic sack also contributes to his dialogue with historiography, and not only because attention and on the imitation and avoidance of which he stakes his claim for the social value of his history. 46.

This is the moment that marks the end of the Roman dark ages and the starting point of the historian’s clariora et certiora deinceps . . . gesta. And one may perhaps read in the lighting effects of Vergil’s image, with flashes of brightness emerging in remarkable density from the noctur- nal background (golden hair and golden clothing, 8.659; gleaming shields, 8.660; white necks tricked out with gold, 8.660–61; glistening spear points, 8.661), a visual manifestation of how Roman history itself moves toward brightness and certainty. However, the presence of the shield itself as a bright artifact contributes to a redefinition of Livian “clarity.” The historian’s combination of clariora with certiora closely connects the sense in which events become more conspicuous with the extent to which they can be accurately known; the claritas of events from this point on contrasts with the “obscurity” of a past described as figuratively more distant in space. But as we have seen, the quality of brightness in Vergil suggests a supernatural presence, the manifestation of divinity generally concealed from human sight and characteristic of the kind of fabulae alien to history as a genre. And if the actual narrative of the Gallic sack still eschews the miraculous, the light imagery heralds a shift toward the full presence of divinities in what follows. As Livian history becomes “clearer” it will show the gods operating less directly; Vergil’s ekphrasis becomes “brighter” when it moves in the opposite direction. Thus precisely at this point, when the historiographic model makes us think that we are approaching the unbroken sequence of Roman history in its most familiar guise, Vergil stages a series of astonishing transformations in his account. First, he practices an extreme form of the “hourglass 49” historiography of a Fabius Pictor, completely omitting the entire history of the Republic from 390 bce to Actium except in the two exemplary figures of Cato and Catiline in the underworld. Second, where we had previously only a linear series of scenes in which narrative position reflected historical sequence, at this point the circular form of the shield, as an image possessing a top and a bottom, emerges to supplant the historiographical “order” by imposing its own patterning on events 50. This patterning in turn locates all Roman history in a spatial continuum that stresses the oppositions of up and down rather than a one-dimensional progression through time. It also puts historic Roman figures like Catiline and Cato in a place where historiography could never go, the underworld 51. At the same time, this new spatial breadth reclaims the cosmic frame that surrounded realistic human scenes in his poetic model, Homer. The opposite pole to the height of the arx turns out not to be the lowest point in the topography of the city, but rather the very bottom of the cosmos 52. We saw before how the up-and-down reflection of light from a 49. Badian 1966: 11. 50. Putnam 1998: 133 brilliantly suggests that the round form of the clipeus is at this point further hinted at by contrast to the rectangular Gallic scuta, described as longa at 8.662. 51. See Hardie 1986: 351–52. 52. On the effect of this shift in perspective, see Zetzel 1996: 310. </page> <page sequence="23"> feldherr: Viewing Myth and History on the Shield of Aeneas 303 basin revealed the cosmic “depth” of the image by anticipating epiphany; here too the very unequal symmetries of up and down make human events vertiginously manifest cosmic and divine realities. Correspondingly, themoral and typological interpretation of the past displaces strict temporal sequence as a structuring principle. This tendency too emerges in the move from Manlius on the Capitoline to Catiline in the underworld. For Manlius’s own career notoriously possessed its own ups and downs. After his heroic salvation of the state, he became a demagogue and was condemned and executed by being thrown down from the Tarpeian rock. The historiographical parallel with Catiline’s similar rebellion and condemnation emerges particularly in the account of Livy, who composes a speech for Manlius beginning with the famous Catilinarian phrase, quo usque tandem (6.18.5).53 Manlius was therefore a notoriously difficult figure to characterize when the course of his life was considered as a single narrative, and the interpretation of his career was intimately connected with the topographical background against which it was set 54. Not only does the Capitoline highlight Manlius’s tragic rise and fall, but the very sight of the Capitoline proved so prejudicial that he could only be condemned when the venue of his trial was moved out of sight of the hill where he had saved the city. Vergil keeps the two halves of Manlius’s career entirely separate by allowing its Catilinarian phase to be displaced by Catiline himself. Unlike those who vote to condemn him, Vergil’s audience sees Manlius only on the Capitoline, and they never see Catiline at all as an actor in the historical landscape but only after condemnation affirms his exemplary badness. According to Aristotle’s distinction, history shows what happened whereas poetry more philosophically reveals potentialities (Poet. 1451b). Vergil here transparently highlights a distinctively poetic move toward types of people whose moral characteristics emerge more clearly when their acts are separated from a historical continuum. But the presence of the Livian intertext55 supplements at once the story and the visual depiction of the scene, further revealing the potential distance between the way events are synchronically depicted on the image and the way they were experienced within the flow of human time, here suggested by the life story of Manlius 56. The move beyond the human scale of history also characterizes a final significant element in Vergil’s turn from historiography after the Gallic sack. All rationalizing scruples about the representation of divine action directly in historiography are fully abandoned in the truly miraculous images of the furies of 53. Innes 1977. 54. See Jaeger 1993. 55. Woodman 1989: 139 notes a density of verbal echoes that both affirms the priority of Livy’s account and its availability to Vergil, and suggests that the poet evokes the historiographic model as an intertext. 56.

Vergil has thus turned Livian historiography on its head by giving a verisimilar and historicized version of the distant periods most subject to distortion and disbelief, but a thoroughly “fabulous” account of recent history. Before moving on to a closer analysis of the Actium scene, let us summarize what the comparison with Livy reveals about the depiction of Roman history in the ekphrasis. The two are connected by an aspiration to the status of visual image and an emphasis on visibility as a point of transition between the represented past and the future to be enacted. However Vergil’s text, by contrast to Livy’s, becomes more visible–both in its explicit use of the imagery of light and in the ability it offers to visualize the shield–as it becomes less like historiography. We can explain this in part simply as a gesture of generic self-assertion; Vergil is after all writing an epic poem about the distant past full of miraculous divine interventions that reaches forward to embrace the present. The apparition of Apollo at Actium, while it may not usher in a new age of present divinities, can nevertheless figure the presence of artistic depictions of such apparitions in contemporary culture, Vergil’s poem among them. More precisely, by presenting the distant past as comprehensible in human terms while the most recent history comes to look like a scene from myth, the poet can interrogate the very tension between representation and reality. His poem makes what Livy defines as poetic subject matter look like history, and historical events look like myth. In the first instance the verisimilar representation makes it easy to accept mythical origins as present reality, to move via the image into the past; in the second the proximity of events brings the divine actions they come to manifest more emphatically into the reader’s reality, making it easier to accept myth as present. But from the contrasting perspective, the very nature of the events described works against an acceptance of Vergil’s poem in that what the reader would expect to see presented poetically become less familiar and perhaps less believable in this verisimilar guise (would a wolf really not eat the twins?) and of course the presentation of Actium as a moment of epiphany exposes his poetry to a distancing skepticism. Whichever set of expectations determines a reader’s response to the ekphrasis, the comparison with historiography heightens the struggle between reality and representation and characterizes the blurring of the distinction between them as a uniquely poetic miracle. To explain how Vergil aims not simply to fold myth into history but to invite investigation of the role of myth in historical representation, I want to focus on the shield’s central image, the account of Actium. Corresponding to the reversal of historiographic norms accomplished through the direct representation of divinities in this portion of the ekphrasis, the poet seems quite explicitly to allude to the generically appropriate precedent of Achilles’ shield in the Iliad. The first images on Vergil’s shield challenge Homeric expectations by moving in a linear direction, and indeed by the very fact that they have a historical sequence with named characters, where Achilles’ shield freezes time into a static field of oppositions </page> <page sequence="25"> feldherr: Viewing Myth and History on the Shield of Aeneas 305 and offers only generic actors.57 But with the transition to Actium we seem to have before us the classic ekphrastic object, with its border of ocean 58, markedly circular form 59, and sense of cosmic tensions eternally played out within a single image. On Homer’s shield war stands opposed to peace; here disordered East challenges the Apollonian West. Both show Olympian gods and personifications doing battle among men. There is even an impious marriage to balance the Homeric wedding. My first point about this scene is simply how explicitly this shield-within- a-shield is presented as an image, an imago (8.671), and an imago that re-stages familiar problems of representation as metal takes on the actual colors of the world and as a static image conveys an impression of movement 60. This internal ekphrasis begins with a heightened reference to the scene’s visibility: in medio classis aeratas, Actia bella, cernere erat totumque instructo Marte videres fervere Leucaten auroque effulgere fluctus. 8.675–77 We are familiar now with the effect of the internal spectator offering access and distance simultaneously to represented objects and the scenes represented on them in turn. But this apostrophe makes it particularly unclear what “you” are imagined to have been able to see and where “you” are positioned in relation to the image 61. The objects of both verbs of seeing refer to what the shield itself depicts, fleets, wars, the Leucates Bay, and the waves, but the way these objects are described simultaneously summons up the visual medium through which they are represented. Ancient ships of course had many bronze elements, but these ships are made of bronze, so too these waves glitter with gold because they are also made from gold.62 The challenge of recognizing the represented image within the representation, a problem evoked elsewhere by the paradoxical interplay between metal and water, is reflected by these golden waves as well. However as the scene develops, such marked reminders of the artifact’s mediation in presenting the image become rarer, and the perspective is increasingly internalized within the representation on the shield: “youwould think theCyclades had been ripped up and were floating on the sea, or that high mountains were crashing against mountains” (pelago credas innare revulsas / Cycladas aut montis concurrere montibus altos, 8.691–92). Yet such visual confusion appears more likely to trouble an imagined 57. See especially the discussion of Putnam 1998: 167–68. 58. Putnam 1998: 136. 59. Cf. the “circular borders” of 8.673: circum argento clari delphines in orbem. On the presence of Homer’s shield particularly in this section of the poem, see DuBois 1982: 43–44. 60. Cf. supra n.22. On the intensely visual nature of Vergil’s description of this central panel of the shield, see esp. West 1975–76: 3–4. 61. Note that line 8.676 seems to invite the reader within an internal visual image by being demarcated with own itself ekphrastic “frame” of visual terms, cernere and videres. 62. On this effect see also esp. Heffernan 1993: 32–33 and Putnam 1998: 138–39. </page> <page sequence="26"> 306 classical antiquity Volume 33/No. 2 /October 2014 spectator within the scene than the viewer of a representation. The titanic scale of the clashing ships must have been reduced to fit on the artifact so that they only resemble mountains when the actual size of the image is forgotten.63 The shift from an awareness of representation to an immersion in the repre- sented action reaches a climax when we move from the depiction of the battle itself to the triumph that celebrates it. If the opening of description of the internal imago is decisively marked, it completely lacks a framing conclusion, and in this respect, I would argue, programmatically anticipates the transition into narrative that concludes the ekphrasis as a whole. Despite the increasing animation of the Actian scene, its static, spatial elements are clearly defined: Augustus leads a fleet from theWest, and Antony from the East. But where in all of this is the triumph? If the battle is the most clearly positioned image on the shield, the triumph seems to have no spatial location at all, and this raises the question of when the description of the shield’s inner emblem ends 64. Rather than having the ekphrasis motivated by description of the image, history has now taken over. The triumph follows the battle not because it is juxtaposed with it on the shield, but because in the course of events triumphs do follow victories. This abrupt transition from the most imagistic point in the shield to the most real has other important dimensions. For the nearly contemporary triumph also owes its reality effect to the possibility that it could have been directly experienced by a significant proportion of the poem’s original audience. And of course nothing in the description of the triumph matches the viciously anthropomorphic and bestial deities battling in the central boss. The triumph looks like a triumph as human eyes would experience it. The move to the triumph elides the boundary between ekphrasis and the unmediated course of events as effectively as that final bridge on the Araxes frustrates closure and “bridges” the space between shield and viewer 65. Again, the pattern of the Homeric image is very precisely reversed: in terms of the architecture of the ekphrasis, it is the representation of the city that frames the cosmic image of ocean 66. This ending thus brings the ekphrasis as fully into the present of the con- temporary reader as the shield does into the presence of the internal spectator Aeneas. Yet the sense that we are moving outward from image back to reality is 63. Cf. Laird 1996: 80–81, who notes the effect of credas I describe, and observes also that the two-fold vehicle for the simile (islands or mountains) has “no equivalent . . . effect in visual media.” (See also Leach 1988: 306n.81, on how such second person verbs “cut across historical time.”) 64. Hu ̈bner 1968: 103 also notes this indeterminacy, suggesting that the construction of the ekphrasis makes one think of the traditional accounts of the borders of shields. 65. On the reality of effect of the triumph scene, see especially the close reading of Putnam 1998: 151–53. Putnam suggests that the reminder of Vulcanic craftsmanship that comes with the enjambed finxerat (8.726) marks another abrupt distancing maneuver, whereas I would stress the resulting sense of a coalescence of shield and triumph in the reader/viewer’s eye. 66. Again, see Feeney 1986: 74 on the resemblance of Aeneas’s shield to the Hesiodic Shield of Hercules. </page> <page sequence="27"> feldherr: Viewing Myth and History on the Shield of Aeneas 307 reversed yet again when we consider the artificiality of the shield. The progress of the description takes us not across the shield or around it but persistently from periphery to center. The instant we apparently emerge from represented image to reality as we have directly experienced it is also the moment when we have reached the innermost point of the shield, when we have been most deeply ab- sorbed by its image. The traffic on the Araxes’ bridge moves in both directions, and the final effect is less to stage the transition from representation to experience, than to collapse the two categories entirely. And here a particular function of triumphs takes on special importance. Beyond being just the last image described, the triumph is itself a spectacle and equally an occasion for the display of artifacts. Shields were after all the quintessential spolia, andVergil’s account of the triumph places equal emphasis on Augustus as a viewer of images and as someone for whom viewing is inseparable from showing.67 He too “acknowledges” (recognoscit) gifts and immediately puts them on display by fixing them to the doorposts of the temple. The procession that he watches consists of peoples arrayed in a linear fashion, but taken together they sketch the cosmic circle of the earth 68, reproducing one of the great tensions of the shield. We watch linear “history” become a circular representation (note the reminder that Mulciber has “wrought” these foreign armies69), as before we had seen a circular representation—the shield boss—lose itself in the historical procession. And as we do so, points of similarity emerge between the mythical shield and the actual triumph. Those rivers that mark the boundary points of the world, the Euphrates and the Araxes, must be figured in the triumph through some kind of anthropomorphized artistic representations just like the ones that the shield uses to depict the Nile 70. The viewer of the triumph stands with the viewer of the shield and against the imagined perspective of Cleopatra, who is at once trapped in events and blind to divine apparitions. Thus the ideological valences of viewing discussed in section two configure this perspective on the triumph itself as privileged by an access to a divine viewpoint. Seeing the triumph as offering a map designating nations extending to the edges of the earth simultaneously establishes the borders of Roman territory and puts them in motion toward the end of the cosmos, again bringing together cosmic icon and historical narrative. It enacts a fusion of human and divine perspective by allowing a mortal audience to view the whole cosmos from above, 67. Cf. Barchiesi’s comments on the interstitial figure of Augustus (1997: 275). 68. For the figures in the triumph collectively rendering an image of the cosmos, see Hardie 1986: 355, and, on the depiction of rivers in triumphs, O ̈ stenberg 2009: 230–45. 69. Cf. especially the comments of Putnam 1998: 152 on how the reference to Mulciber re-imposes an awareness of the artifact itself. 70. “The triumph is, in other words construed as being a ceremony of image-making as much as it is one of images. It is the place where, in many written versions, representation (or mimesis) reaches its limits, and where the viewer (or reader) is asked to decide what counts as an image or where the boundary between reality and representation is to be drawn,” Beard 2007: 181. For the role of representations in the triumph, see now O ̈ stenberg 2009: 189–261. </page> <page sequence="28"> 308 classical antiquity Volume 33/No. 2 /October 2014 and finally it uses this perspective to enact precisely the distinctions between Roman and other that the rivers “map” through the opposition between what the audience sees as spectator and the limitation of vision imposed on the defeated spectacle (both Cleopatra on the shield and the actual captives in the triumph who are there to be looked at). Yet this perspective is also conditioned by history. As we have seen, one arrives at the triumph through an absorption in the linear sequence of time, and the representation seems naturally to follow after the events. We see first the battle, then the representation of the battle, and so the human sequence of historical representation seems restored. The shield itself that emerges from the cosmic dimensions of the triumph seems emphatically to come after history. The appropriation of the Homeric cosmic emblem seems to have been won by Rome’s historical victories, as Livy says the Romans have won the right to mythologize their past by their very imperial success (praef . 7). As Vergil stages the progressive disappearance of the image into the Augustan reality it represents, Augustus fashions history into a series of images and integrates them into the fabric of the city. At this point I want to return to Aeneas, that real figure by the river, and his ignorance of the events depicted. The radical separation of this internal spectator from Vergil’s contemporary reader, who would know the scenes depicted very well, could be seen as an abrupt “reality check,” thwarting any possibility that the shield offers the kind of immersion in the image that I have been arguing for and through which fama and fata take on presence and substance.71 His very participation in the scene bounds the shield by reminding us that it is in fact an object and that the flow of time really does control how we respond to images— how much of the stream we can see. This works against the ekphrastic slippage that makes every Roman viewer/actor the same irrespective of his temporal perspective. But the description of Aeneas can also just as powerfully suggest the fusion of viewing experiences I have been describing. The argument again involves the river Araxes and the fact that it was still un-bridged in 19 bce. For by leading the contemporary readers right up to the point at which history has yet to be realized, the shield’s representation of the Roman past takes them toward a temporal position analogous to that of Aeneas himself. What Aeneas sees is also, from his temporal perspective, the future. And if one were to consider what Aeneas might perceive in the shield, the images by no means lack possible references. Aeneas has seen Rome; he has seen the underworld; he has participated in a cataclysmic struggle between East and West in which the gods took an active role. Indeed two early scenes on the shield recall precise descriptions of the very landscape within which he receives the image. As a divine offspring (natumque in valle reducta, 8.609), earlier located within a shady grove (undique colles / inclusere cavi et nigra nemus abiete cingunt, 8.598–99), near a river (prope . . . 71. See especially Lyne’s (1987) interpretation of the line as manifesting “dramatic irony” by separating the viewer’s understanding of the scene from the protagonists, supra, n.1. </page> <page sequence="29"> feldherr: Viewing Myth and History on the Shield of Aeneas 309 amnem, 8.597), a space rendered sacred by ancestral religion (religione patrum late sacer, 8.598), he might well be at the Lupercal 72. The hills above provide the site for the Etruscan camp, a safe place because it affords a wide view (tuta tenebant . . . celsoque . . . de colle videri, 8.603–604). So the account of early Rome ends with another urban landscape contrasting to the cave, a lofty, fortified hill from where the attacking enemies are, ultimately, able to be seen. The recognition of Aeneas as a viewer seeing with Vergil’s audience rather than differentiated from them by his lack of historical knowledge thus completes an “integrated” reading of the description of the shield, one that highlights the fusion of mythical past and present and suggests the ekphrasis itself as a metaphoric bridge, transporting the image into the present and making the scenes it depicts seem real. The linear rivers marching in the triumphal procession that figures the extension of Roman power ultimately flow, circularly, back to their origins in recalling the small local stream in the distant past where the story begins. But if the viewers thereby forget their place in the sequence of time, the prospective and sequential results of their seeing brings back an awareness of historicity. Each viewer translates his reception of the shield into action, performing new deeds following on those depicted and themselves destined for representation. Here Vergil’s poem is close to realizing the ultimate goal of Livian viewing as a prompt for re-performing a purified and idealized past. But what the viewer of the shield sees is the circular whole, which is available neither to a Porsenna nor to the audience for a purely linear narrative of the past. And this involves not just knowing a future destiny to which the non-Roman tyrant is blind, but understanding the “circular,” cosmic dimensions of Roman history as a manifestation of an order fully capable of giving structure to the future as well as the past. The viewer is thus privileged not simply to see more of the past but to step outside of time and see history made whole. On one level the circular patterning of time implies a familiar reunification of past with future, whether because the course of history will bring the Romans back to the morality of their ancestors or through epiphanic ritual moments that elide temporal distance. Thus Denis Feeney has powerfully described how the capacity of a particular date within an annual cycle to construct a “wormhole” linking then to now underpins the temporal structure of book 8: the day of the year when the shield was shown to Aeneas, August 13, anticipates precisely that of its last event, the triumph of Octavian in 29 bce, which was in turn an occasion for recalling the past 73. 72. The grove at Caere is said to have been consecrated by Greek immigrants (Pelasgi) to Silvanus (8.600), another set of primordial Greeks were said to have founded the Lupercalia in honor of Pan (8.343). 73. Feeney 2007: 162, drawing on the analysis of Drew 1927: 16–17. See also, esp., Grimal 1951. Attention to the dates of Octavian’s triumph can further reinforce the sense that the description of this episode takes us to the threshold of the future. For while Octavian’s triple celebration indeed began on the 13th, that day was devoted to the Dalmatian triumph. The commemoration of Actium </page> <page sequence="30"> 310 classical antiquity Volume 33/No. 2 /October 2014 But shorter cycles of time, also featured on the shield, direct us toward a more radical escape from temporality and suggest what is at stake for Vergil in distinguishing his work from historiography rather than just appropriating its aims. Day and night follow one another in the same rhythm irrespective of any particular date, but they also give a model for understanding the relation of part to whole that provides greater perspective on the nature of historical circularity. Beyond the question of whether the dark nights of Roman history are destined to return, or whether we are to exalt in the coming of a new dawn—the “pessimistic” and “optimistic” readings of historical circularity within the poem—the shield allows us to see day and night simultaneously as inevitable components of a single big picture and manifests their logical inseparability with an almost Lucretian insistence.74 The importance of time of day as a motif within the shield emerges just as we make the transition from the purely historical sequence of the opening scenes to the cosmic aspects of the shield’s design. Rome’s narrow escape from the Gallic threat must happen at night, a night whose darkness, on which the Gauls rely (defensi tenebris et dono noctis opacae, 8.658), is made “visible” to the Romans within the narrative, and perhaps to the viewer of the shield, via the golden flashes of hair and weaponry. This historical association of Rome’s enemies with the favoring darkness of night, while the Romans rely on the support above all of the sun god Apollo, will of course structure the allegories of the Actium panel. After the darkness of night comes dawn, Aurora, the region from which Antony leads the forces of the east (8.685). Yet this allusion to dawn does not immediately herald the day—the references to burning tow and the reddening of the sea (8.695) link the troops arriving from their own “Red Sea” only with the confusions of twilight and violence. Full daylight emerges with Apollo, first standing above the Roman forces (desuper, 8.705) and finally as god of the gleaming temple (candentis, 8.720) from which Caesar watches the triumph. The shield’s content thus correlates the progress of Roman history with the coming of day, and the concluding epiphany of brightnessmarks out Vergil’s linear narrative of them both as a similar journey to light. But the ending point of that journey is the real presence of an imago that perpetually juxtaposes the darkness of its top and bottom with the brilliance of its center, tricks out its darkest portions with golden lights, and indeed constructs an opposition between the Romans’ ability to see the manifestations of day with their enemies’ dependence on the murky vision of darkness. Light and dark also become simultaneous presences at crucial moments of Roman history, the Gallic sack and the battle of Actium, took place on the next day, August 14th. Thus if Aeneas receives the shield in the evening of the 13th, its final events will take place “tomorrow.” This progression can be further correlated with the superimposition of the transition from night to darkness within the events depicted on the shield (see below). For a discussion of the distribution of events in the three triumphs, and particularly the epigraphic evidence, see Gurval 1995: 31–33. 74. On darkness and light as manifestations of the cosmic dimensions of Rome’s history, see Hardie 1986: 357–58. </page> <page sequence="31"> feldherr: Viewing Myth and History on the Shield of Aeneas 311 as they are on the shield itself when viewed whole. For an individual Roman viewer, located at his own particular moment time, this reminder that even at the most imperiled moments in the nation’s history the gods were present, but only for them, can of course inspire hope. Yet when read together with an awareness of the limited temporal perspectives of the individual figures on the shield, the imagery may suggest, in more Lucretian terms, a fundamental inseparability of creation and destruction. All mortal existence, not just that of Rome’s enemies, stands in illuminating contrast to the divine brilliance of the whole 75. And this pattern emerges when we view events not from within the shield, or the temporal narrative its contents portray and into which the triumphal procession absorbs us, but from above it, the position of gods looking down on men and men looking as gods. A final pattern of imagery sharpens the interaction between these temporal perspectives and relates them again to the issue of the image’s presence in historical time and real space. As we have seen, when Venus presents the arms to her son, she appears at evening, and the reference to her luminous appearance (aetherios inter dea candida nimbos, 8.608) connects her divine brilliance at once to the armor she bears and to the evening star. Celestial bodies like the evening star provide fundamental indices of the passage of human time. The reference to the evening star correspondingly starts the clock both for the linear sequence of events on the shield, and for the narrative of the shield as a presence in the poem. From the moment when the shield emerges most clearly as an iconic presence, the Gallic sack, it also begins to depict a “plot” moving from darkness to light. The evening star fits into this pattern by marking the coming of twilight before the shield’s “night,” just as Venus’s nurturing of her son prefigures as well as precedes the wolf’s tending the sons of Mars. As part of the story of the finished shield as artifact within the plot of the poem, the evening star stands first in a series of similar manifestations of its presence. In his next appearance after donning the divine armor, Aeneas seems to have entered the picture itself by showing himself precisely in the posture adopted by Augustus at Actium (stans celsa in puppi, 10.261 8.680). But to his enemies the light that pours from his shield makes him seem like bloody comets “reddening” the night sky or like the destructive Sirius (10.272–75).76 The imagery of the first simile combines two of the visual effects associated with the forces opposed to Rome on the shield, the illuminated darkness of the Gallic attack (liquida . . . nocte, 10.272 dono noctis opacae, 8.658) and the ruddy light at Actium (rubent, 10.273 ab litore rubro, 8.686 rubescunt, 8.695), while the second assimilates him to a star, recalling perhaps the celestial vision that accompanied the armor 75. Cf. the complementary comments of DuBois 1982: 49: “The vision of Augustus triumphant is an attempt to deny the limitations of the individual’s fixity in time; the ignorance of Aeneas about that triumph serves only to emphasize how little any mortal can know of the future.” 76. On these images, see also Putnam 1998: 141. </page> <page sequence="32"> 312 classical antiquity Volume 33/No. 2 /October 2014 itself. And indeed in challenging Turnus here, Aeneas accomplishes precisely the motive his mother had claimed for presenting the weapons to him (that he should soon not hesitate to challenge his Laurentian opponents or Turnus himself, 8.613–14). The image of heavenly lights thus allows the reader to trace a series of imitations within the poem, leading from the original manifestation of the image to its activation within the poem’s plot. As this sequence is contiguous with the series of actions the object itself depicts, so the armed figure of Aeneas simultaneously recalls the images on the shield and the image of the shield. The temporal patterns the star traces are also ultimately circular, the alternations of seasons in a year or light and darkness in a day, but the star can only fulfill this function because it is itself unchanging. The presence of the celestial image, therefore, in comparison to the revelation of human time provides both an escape and a contrast. Everyone who takes his place in the line of imitators on the shield passes into and out of time, due to be succeeded within the historical narrative. But as a figure of the shield as a whole, Aeneas and Augustus lose their individual identity to instantiate the same image of immortal presence. Not only, then, do human history and divine artifact mutually define one another like the contrast between light and darkness, but the image in its entirety possesses a remarkably antithetical range of effects, both salvific and destructive. For at the same time that Aeneas seems to resemble the victor at Actium, he is also seen by his own opponents as an instauration not of the promise of Roman transcendence but of the deadly force of its opponents. Thus as the Rutulians wonder at Aeneas in book 10, he seems reddened (Rutulianized?) by the reflection of the Antonian “red shore.” And Sirius, beyond being a deadly star in its own right, seems precisely the opposite of Vesper as it appears in book 8.77 Again, history provides a tempting way to order this contrast. Perhaps the epiphany of the shield will manifest salvation for Romans but death to their foes and thus further enter into the process of creating the Roman present: each appearance of the shield distinguishes Roman from non-Roman. On the other hand, the shield’s power may truly stand outside of time as a reminder that human history is always measured under the sight of eternity. The morning star is of course identical to the evening star. 77. In a prior simile (8.589), Vesper under the guise of Lucifer appears “bathed in the waves of Ocean,” while burning Sirius brings thirst and diseases. For more on this simile, see n.80, below. </page> <page sequence="33"> feldherr: Viewing Myth and History on the Shield of Aeneas 313 CONCLUSION The phenomenon of ekphrasis pits an awareness of textual narrative against the illusion of a visual artifact that pre-exists the poet’s act of description. A well mapped sequence of alternatives results for the readers’ interpretation of such embedded descriptions, and consideration of these alternatives flows easily toward awareness of the paradoxes and potentials of poetic mimesis 78. The visibility of the image places an inevitable limit on the “reality effect” of verbal representation: the audience can never be made to see. Poetry returns the favor by highlighting the ultimate impossibility of the image’s recreating the experience of temporality. A work of visual art can never be fully diachronic in the same measure that poetry can never not be diachronic. The first must always show the stages of a narrative together; the second can never represent an image whole, isolated from the linearity of description. Temporality becomes confused in another sense as the reader asks about the logical priority of image and description. The artifact must be there to be described, so within the narrative not only does the image come first, but it interrupts or reverses the flow of the narrative, at best slowing progress, and in the most extreme cases creating the need for a digression moving back in time to account for its creation or arrival on the scene. Yet in reality the poet has created the image, and this fact imposes itself more forcefully in the reception of ancient poetry where ekphrases were never direct copies from a predecessor but opportunities for authorial invention. These fundamental potentialities of ekphrases thus conflate an awareness of the contrast between different temporal schemes, both within the narrative and outside it, with an investigation into the reality effect of poetic representation. This paper has shown how Vergil’s account of the shield draws attention to the formal tensions of ekphrasis and invests them with thematic significance, but also how he stages his poem’s transcendence of the distance between image and narrative. Rivers, which can be seen whole on maps and when personified in triumphs, but only in parts from the perspective of an individual standing on their banks, are ideal symbols for the difference between synchronicity and diachronicity. More than that, their framing function within epic’s most influential ekphrasis, the Iliad’s shield of Achilles, makes them inevitably point to the form itself. Vergil’s description of the shield substitutes historical process for iconic synchronicity by positioning rivers within the narrative rather than the image. Rivers such as the Tiber, the Nile, and the Araxes appear when in “the course of time” they enter Roman history, yet reference to them simultaneously transforms the empire whose growth has been described and the narrative that describes it into a synchronic manifestation of the cosmos. The presence of rivers within 78. Full review of the seminal ambiguities of ekphrases for literary theory would be out of place even if it were possible. For orientation, see Bartsch and Elsner 2007. Of particular importance for what follows are Mitchell 1992, Krieger 1992, and Fowler 1991. </page> <page sequence="34"> 314 classical antiquity Volume 33/No. 2 /October 2014 the narrative also allows the shield itself to enter history by depicting viewers at specificmoments in time responding to symbolic manifestations of the ekphrasis’s distinctive combination of visual and narrative properties. Thus Porsenna’s attitude toward events clustered along the Tiber traces his constraint in two dimensions: he can neither cross rivers as the Romans will when their history, and the ekphrasis, conclude in the Augustan present, nor can he see up and down the stream. The presence of such viewers on its own allows for a disjunction between the perspective of the readers, not seeing events directly, and internal spectators, who cannot place what they see within a larger historical context. But it also provides an imaginative supplement to the reader’s reception of the ekphrasis as merely textual description. Engagement with the formal properties and programmatic claims of historiographic narrative highlights the integration of the ekphrasis with the flow of real events in two senses. First, it stresses that in contrast to the generic scenes on Achilles’ shield or the mythical ones familiar from other epic ekphrases, Aeneas’s shield depicts historical events 79. Second, the utilitarian claims of written history to affect the course of events models the incorporation of the viewer into the historical sequence depicted on the shield. Yet while historiographic standards of verification expose the fictional basis and circularity of Vergil’s appeal to Vulcan’s authority for the content of his narrative, Vergil highlights poetry’s ability to reproduce divine action with greater immediacy and so to set the events of history more effectively in a broader, cosmic context than what emerges from the linear sequence of cause and effect. Vergil’s ekphrasis, as it allows men to see the past while also building the future, also makes it possible for men to see gods and to see as gods, with an awareness both of sequential events as part of a synchronic whole juxtaposing creation and destruction as well as of the limits that bound the human perception of actions in time. The ultimate aim of my analysis has been to present the text as explicitly effecting a transcendent synthesis overcoming at once the distance between past and present, image and reality, actor and observer, and mortal and divine. But recognition of what the poem accomplishes must itself depend on its articulation of the differences between these categories. Thus as bright and dark are separate components on the shield, so this unified reading co-exists with alternative interpretations based on disunity and exclusion. Hence all three sections of the paper have devoted some space to developing discordant alternatives to the reading proposed. In section one, we saw how the model of human viewer and divine maker cooperating together to produce the oscillations between stasis and motion that make the ekphrasis both moving image and iconic, vivid narrative also suggests the darker alternative of imagining god and man involved in contrasting patterns of creation. Vulcan softens metal only to give it an immutable form that 79. Though see Hardie 1986: 343–46 on how ancient allegorizations of Homer’s shield as depicting historical events may have blurred this distinction. </page> <page sequence="35"> feldherr: Viewing Myth and History on the Shield of Aeneas 315 conforms to reality—the hard surface that remains all the shield is—whereas the viewer’s ability to supply the perspectives and responses of the figures depicted helps bring them to life. So in the second section, the viewer’s divine relegation of a defeated enemy like Cleopatra to the status of a spectacle to be seen perhaps encounters resistance from an account of her potential viewing, even if that potential is only mentioned to be specifically negated in the queen’s designation as blind to the serpents pursuing her. Finally, a historiographic reading of the shield, rather than contributing a sense of presence and reality to the epic artifact, can expose the divine perspective revealed in the shield as the fiction of a human author, an author himself perhaps transparently advancing the agenda of Augustus in presenting the fugitive Cleopatra only as something to be seen. With these alternatives in mind, I want to end by drawing fuller attention to a moment earlier in the narrative in book 8 that anticipates the climactic donning of the shield that makes the viewer Aeneas himself a radiant part of the shield’s story. If one of the results of viewing the shield as a whole is to merge—for the Roman viewer—dark and light into a single image, here we meet an audience who appears tragically excluded from such a perspective. As Aeneas leads the troops Evander has given him away from Pallanteum, “Pallas himself appears in the midst of the van, visible in his chlamys and figured arms” (ipse agmine Pallas / in medio chlamyde et pictis conspectus in armis, 8.587–88). Not only does the description of Pallas in arms that bear their own designs anticipate the Trojan hero in his divine armor, but after the elaborate description of the narrative content of the shield, a retrospective reading of the phrase pictis conspectus in armismakes Pallas himself resemble one of the figures represented there. Not just one in a succession of radiantly armed persons, Pallas becomes both actor and representation, simultaneously inside and outside the image. Further cementing the link between the two scenes is the simile comparing the brilliant Pallas to the dawn star: qualis ubi Oceani perfusus Lucifer unda, quem Venus ante alios astrorum diligit ignis, extulit os sacrum caelo tenebrasque resoluit. 8.589–91 The image tightens Pallas’s resemblance to Aeneas (as object of Venus’s love) and anticipates the epiphany of the armor, when Venus is likened to a celestial body 80. But Pallas is not only to be perceived as a star or as a figure conspicuous for (or on) his armor. He is also, crucially, a figure within a procession, and it is from that perspective—rather than as another instantiation of the transhistorical 80. As Eden 1975: 158 observes, Vergil has here adapted two Homeric similes, one comparing Achilles to the evening star (Il. 22.317ff.), the other Diomedes to Sirius (Il. 5.4ff). The latter is the closer parallel, but Vergil has taken the star from the second simile and further transformed it by making it the morning star rather than the evening star, Hesperus. </page> <page sequence="36"> 316 classical antiquity Volume 33/No. 2 /October 2014 type of a warrior illuminated by divine favor—that the internal audience within the narrative beholds him. The fearful mothers who stand upon the walls of the city are immobile and can only follow him with their eyes as he moves away from them never to return (8.592–93). The last visual impression of the army’s departure again combines images of darkness and light, “a cloud of dust and the troops gleaming with bronze.” The dust cloud contrasts strikingly with the cloud lit by the rays of the rising sun to which the breastplate will be compared some thirty lines later, and while to the reader brightness and darkness are preserved together in the line, from the imagined point of view of the stationary matres, the dust cloud is destined to consume the flashes of bronze. Such a model of unidirectional viewing, by a (female) audience fixed only in their place in time, offers a telling foil to the perspective of Vergil’s readers, who, having learned to see the poem as imago, are able to incorporate Pallas too within the timeless textum of the shield—if they violate the natural order of history and linear narrative by moving backwards through the text to read the beginning of the story from its ekphrastic ending.81 Princeton University feldherr@princeton.edu BIBLIOGRAPHY Badian, E. 1966. “The Early Historians.” In T.

It is important to observe that the series of images that places Pallas among the immortal heroes figured by Venus’s Lucifer balances another that confirms the mothers’ presentiment of his mortality. As a reader of an earlier version of this paper observes, the description of Pallas pictis conspectus in armis also anticipates the importance of his baldric. This piece of figured armor puts him in another sequence, extending perhaps from the dead youths it depicts to Turnus, who having put on this baldric in turn, condemns himself to death. </page> <page sequence="37"> feldherr: Viewing Myth and History on the Shield of Aeneas 317 Commager, S. 1980. “Fateful Words: Some Conversations in Aeneid 4.” Arethusa 14: 101–14.
