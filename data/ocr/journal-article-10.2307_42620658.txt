HURWIT University of Oregon The Representation of Nature in Early Greek Art The moon has set And the Pleiades, and the middle of the night has come. Time goes by And I lie alone . . . In tributed natural this fragmentary world to Sappho,1 but realizes lyric the often in poet her (and observes solitude rightly) that the at- tributed to Sappho,1 the poet observes the natural world but realizes in her solitude that she is not part of it or its rhythms. The night sky seems almost hostile in its undisturbed, indifferent motion, in its disregard of the poet's feeling. She is isolated and distinct from nature; it is "other." Here, all agree, is Sappho again, and one of the richest descrip- tions of nature in Archaic poetry: She honored you like a goddess manifest, and in your song delighted most of all. But now among the ladies of Lydia she is pre-eminent, like the rosy-fingered moon after sunset, Surpassing all the stars; its light spreads over the salt sea alike and the field of flowers, And the lovely dew is shed, and roses bloom, and tender chervil and blossoming melilot. To and fro, wandering, She remembers gentle Atthis with yearning; surely her tender heart is heavy . . .2 The same sort of flowery and dewy meadow appears elsewhere in Archaic Greek poetry, and it is an idealized and conventional place, a "meadow of love."3 But its presence here is not the most interesting thing about the poem. What is striking is the abrupt transi- tion from the lush but imagined landscape (which is itself described in a simile and thus exists only in a world of reference or analogy, in a frame detached from the outer world of the poem) to Atthis' unnamed friend, "wan- dering to and fro." She is not wandering in the landscape of the simile,- we are not told where she is wandering. She is just some- where in Lydia, yearning and grieving, and the luxuriant, evocative landscape of the simile, like the starry night of "The moon has set," is in stark contrast to her (and to Atthis') iso- lation. She is a figure - they are both fig- ures - without place.4 As such they are quint- essentially Archaic. Every culture, society, or people must somehow come to terms with its environ- ment, must somehow structure a set of re- lationships, more or less complex, with the natural world. But no culture, society, or peo- ple is obligated to admire or love its land- scape, to find its countryside beautiful or the raw nature beyond the fields and hills, the wilderness at the margins, sublime. Not every landscape excites what the geographer Yi-Fu Tuan has called "topophilia," "the af- fective bond between people and place or set- ting."5 The veneration of landscape, the fa- miliar Romantic impulse to create artistic worlds that are doubles for the worlds of our intellect, ideologies, or emotions, outer worlds that really offer inner, imaginative journeys, have not always or everywhere been components of human desire (that the Ro- mantic attitude toward nature is especially familiar to us should not obscure the fact that it is a particularly extreme position).6 And the 33</page><page sequence="3">habit the Romantics had of fusing themselves with nature or of describing themselves wan- dering through it is one that not many earlier poets shared. Byron's question Are not the mountains, waves, and skies, a part of me and of my soul, as I of them?7 would, I think, have mystified an early Greek poet, not to mention a Medieval one. And so might David Hockney's infatuation with southern California: "I'm deeply attracted to the space of this place/' he recently told the magazine of United Airlines. "You feel deeply of the earth. It makes you feel small - very good for the soul, I think. It's a spiritual ex- perience in a way."8 This is topophilia, and it is a feeling that many artists in human his- tory, in their own landscapes, have simply not felt. We probably perceive nature the way we are taught to perceive it, and cultural expecta- tions may counteract even strong instincts.9 Certainly, our representations of nature in- struct us, conditioning our aesthetic attitudes when we come upon nature itself once again. Thus, topophilia is basically a learned re- sponse: it is not universal or innate.10 And even where it may be genuinely felt, it may not be expressed in literature or art. It may be silent, it may be invisible; undetected, it may nonetheless be real.11 Or it may be ex- pressed in other ways - in, for example, the placement of a temple upon a precipice (as at Sounion) or on a mountainside (as at Bassae). There, the sympathetic commentary between ordered form and rough nature at first seems the point, though it may also be that the tem- ple, which (in the language of Wallace Ste- vens) is like nothing else in the landscape, makes the landscape surround it, and so, man-made, takes dominion over it - an im- position of culture upon the land, rather than a communion with it.12 Here, then, are some things at the root of our problem, and a caution as well: the apparent dearth of landscapes in early Greek poetry and art does not necessarily mean that topophilia was utterly absent from the early Greek temperament.13 Conversely, topophilia and a sensitivity to the beauties of the environment are not the only phenomena that can lead to the depiction of landscape or its elements. Paradoxically, perhaps, topophilia may at times be irrelevant to the representa- tion of nature and place. Descriptions of the natural world are really not so rare in the poetry of early Greece, though the descriptions are generally of single elements or small sections of nature rather than of comprehensive, picturesque panora- mas. Beauty seems to reside mostly in the de- tails - in, for instance, the narcissus with a hundred blooms and sweet smell that Per- sephone picks in the Hymn to Demeter (lines 8- 1 1 ), a thing of awe ( sebas ) for both gods and mortals - and the Greek view of nature, with the usual exceptions, thus seems myopic, ig- noring distances and scale.14 The problem is that those who have expectantly looked (usu- ally through the hazy filter of romanticism) for expressions of an emotional or sentimen- tal attachment to the natural world in early Greek poetry, and by extension in early Greek art, have not found very many (they have not even found a single Greek word for landscape, though not too much should be made of that).15 Finding the ancient Greeks curiously unlike Wordsworth, Constable, or Heine, they have looked for possible explanations, and they have found plenty. For Friedrich Schiller, who essentially began the search in 1795 with his essay "Über naive und sentimentalische Dichtung," the ancient Greeks (and he was speaking of them all, not just the Greeks of the Archaic period) failed to respond to or describe the beauty of the natural world because they were too close to nature, too "naive" in their relation to it, too much in accord with it, to conceive of it as a subject for representation. "With them culture had not degenerated so much that na- ture was abandoned for it. . . . Since, there- fore, the Greeks had not lost nature in hu- manity, they could not be astonished by it outside of humanity and had no such urgent need for objects in which they found it again. . . . They felt in a natural way, we feel the Natural."16 For Alexander von Hum- boldt, who devoted a few pages of his mon- umental work, Kosmos, to the problem, the answer was not the naivete but the anthro- pocentrism of the Greeks, which made of na- ture a mere accessory: "in Grecian art, all things are centered in the sphere of human life. The description of nature in its manifold richness of form, as a distinct branch of poetic literature, was wholly unknown to the Greeks. The landscape appears among them merely as the back-ground of the picture of which human figures constitute the main 34 HURWIT</page><page sequence="4">subject/717 And there is ancient authority for this almost inescapable conclusion as early as Plato's Crítias : we do not pay much attention to depictions of mountains, rivers, and woods, Cri tias says (implying, incidentally, that such depictions were not uncommon or remarkable in and of themselves), but paint- ings of the human figure come under our most intense scrutiny (107C-D). The repre- sentational status of the human figure was simply higher. Yet in a famous chapter of his Modern Painters, John Ruskin gave four rea- sons for the apparent failure of the Greeks to respond to nature in addition to the notion that they were just too obsessed with the human form to bother with anything else: (1) they could not distinguish the landscape from all the divinities who occupied it; (2) being inhabitants of Greece, they were so used to the beauties of nature that they became jaded by and indifferent to it; (3) they lived such healthy lives they did not experience the fits of melancholy that the contemplation of na- ture can relieve; and (4) they, loving sym- metry, feared "all that was disorderly, unbal- anced, and rugged." "They shrank with dread or hatred from all the ruggedness of lower na- ture, - from the wrinkled forest bark, the jag- ged hill-crest, and irregular, inorganic storm of sky." The Greeks took pleasure only in places more "in harmony with the laws of [the human figure's] gentler beauty" - middle landscapes like meadows, fountains, and shady groves, landscapes like those in Sap- pho's lyrics.18 There is enough evidence in early Greek po- etry to support some of these views. There is even enough to launch a defense of the Greeks, to argue that they responded to the beauties of nature well enough after all, 19 that varieties of topophilia were not unknown,20 even that they could feel or describe some- thing like the English Romantic Sublime. In a simile from the Iliad, Zeus "removes a dense cloud from the peak of some great mountain, and the lookout points and spurs and clearings are distinctly seen as though pure space had broken through from heaven" - and with that Archaic poetry prob- ably comes as close as it ever gets to Words- worth.21 The evidence of Archaic poetry, in other words, is rich and varied enough for us to conclude that there was no single, all-en- compassing Archaic Greek attitude toward nature, that it shifts from genre to genre, poet to poet, poem to poem, even, in some cases, from one part of a poem to another. But there is one current in Archaic poetry that, running among others,22 runs especially strong: the sense of the natural world as "other," as fun- damentally distinct from human beings. The source of this current is the Iliad itself, where nature not only seems unremittingly hos- tile - a rainbow, of all things, is considered an omen of war23 - but where the world of heroic action and the world of nature rarely make contact. The world of the narrative lacks detailed descriptions of places and set- tings; the spatial relationships among the Achaean camp, the few known features of the Trojan plain, and the citadel itself are unex- plored and blurry,-24 and parsimonious Homer only occasionally places a single oak, wild fig, or shrub amid the action, for a landmark or prop. Thus, for example, Odysseus hangs Do- lon's weapons and clothing upon a tamarisk at 10, 465-468, turning it into a signpost in the night, and at 21, 18 another narratively useful tamarisk appears so that Achilles can lean his spear against it.25 The heroes of the Iliad act in a narrative world that, for all we are told of it, is prac- tically barren. But it is not that the landscape is desolate, laid waste by war; it is that the landscape, for the most part, is just not there. As Annie Bonnafé has shown in detail, nature and landscape exist primarily in the world of the simile, in the world of reference. Al- though nature can be given semihuman as- pects, even a will, and although similes some- times are used to suggest the mood or anxiety of heroes,26 nature remains distinct, inhu- man, even adversarial: its inhuman pitiless- ness is clear at 16, 34-35, where Patroklos charges that Achilles must have been the child of "the grey sea and steep cliffs, since your mind is so harsh," and the essential an- tagonism between man and nature is my- thologized in the battle between Achilles and the River Xanthos in book 2 1 .27 And nowhere in the Iliad, and only rarely elsewhere in Ar- chaic poetry, are there any concessions that man might actually live in pleasant harmony with a nature untamed and undomesti- cated.28 To be sure, there are in Homer, as in Sappho, Aleman, and other early Greek poets, beautiful descriptions of beautiful natural scenes: Calypso's pleasure garden comes to mind. But what dominates Archaic poetry is a process that detaches nature, setting it apart HURWIT 35</page><page sequence="5">from human beings, making it an artifact to be seen, not an environment to be experi- enced: it is "over there," and it needs observ- ers at a distance (like Hermes, in the case of Calypso's wild bower, or Odysseus, in the case of Alkinoos' manicured gardens), rather than occupants.29 Now, the otherness of na- ture as perceived by the poets, their reluc- tance to visualize their figures or themselves in a fully detailed setting, and the distance of human beings from nature do not by them- selves explain the absence of landscape from early Greek art. Still, it may not be merely coincidental that the world of Archaic art happens to be essentially the same as the pri- mary world of the Iliad - a narrative world that is virtually a natural vacuum. The Nowhere of early Greek art, the dearth of place and setting, almost goes unnoticed, the Archaic concentration on the human form seems so intense and complete. It is symptomatic that in his Die Naturwieder- gabe in der älteren griechischen Kunst, Emanuel Loewy could list the absence of landscape as one of seven defining character- istics of the Archaic style: for Loewy the early Greek treatment of "nature" was identical with and limited to its treatment of the human form.30 And Loewy had a point. There are no more than eight Archaic reliefs with landscape elements preserved (though the se- ries begins rather early with the olive tree in- cised into the background beside the giant or Titan attacked by Zeus in the angle of the Corfu pediment).31 And the percentage of Ar- chaic vases that bear the image of even a sin- gle tree or rock is, compared to those vases that bear nothing but human figures, very small indeed. If we exclude the plucked and portable nature - the flowers, myrtle branches,32 ivy, vines, and so forth - that many Archaic figures wear or carry around with them (especially Dionysos and his co- horts, with their proto -thyrsa), the percent- age is perhaps no higher than 5 percent.33 But what is sometimes not appreciated is how rare - and how odd - the Archaic Greek artist's attitude toward the representation of nature seems to be in the history of ancient art as a whole. Even a Neolithic artist could apparently paint his dominolike city against the backdrop of an erupting volcano.34 In Egypt, paintings and reliefs of men managing the landscape, of gardens and rivers, of marshes and desert, abound; there is even a scene of a landscape destroyed by the armies of Ramses II.35 In the art of Mesopotamia and Assyria, emperors and armies ascend mountainous landscapes, attack mountain- top cities, visit grottoes, or cross rivers and marshes in almost maplike settings, and lions await death in luxuriant gardens.36 Within the Aegean region itself Bronze Age artists de- picted agrimi cavorting on peaks, warriors de- fending coastal towns, monkeys hunting for eggs or cats stalking game along lush streams and in ivy thickets, bulls captured on undu- lating terrain amid olives and palms, ships sailing past richly detailed islands and coasts, and swallows darting through clusters of lil- ies growing from nearly animate rocks.37 It is striking that essentially the same environ- ment could apparently excite topophilia in cultures that occupied it early, but not in an- other that occupied it later on. Even the Etruscans are generally supposed to have dis- played a much keener appreciation of nature than the Greeks. And if there has been one comparison that time and again has been used to prove how different in this respect the Etruscans and the Greeks really were, it is the one between the Tomb of Hunting and Fishing at Tarquinia (figs, i, 2) and the lid from the Tomb of the Diver at Paestum (fig. 3).38 In the rear cham- ber of the Etruscan tomb (dated variously from c. 5 30 to c. 500), small boys hunt orange, blue, and outlined birds, net and spear fish in a continuous, choppy sea, and dive from a sheer, stratified cliff in an extensive, island- dotted seascape that seems to exult in the joy- ous (if here unrealistic) colors, freedom, and very scale of the natural world. The Etruscan fresco thus puts human beings and their ac- tivities in their proper place and proportion: the boys do not dominate the scene by their size, but act in nature.39 The view of nature is not deep - there is no recession into the distance, and we are reminded of the hard reality of the front plane by the painted gar- lands hanging from the striped cornice above - but it is nonetheless large, wide, and inclusive. In the Greek panel (c. 500-480), 40 there is another diver, but the view of nature is far different. There are trees here and, like most trees in Archaic Greek art, they are little and spindly ( "stark and bare as broomsticks," in Christopher M. Dawson's apt phrase),41 their small gray leaves hugging the branches tight. Their evocation of nature, moreover, is 36 HURWIT</page><page sequence="6">i.

In fact, many Archaic Greek vases seem to question or wittily blur the distinction between land- scape element and decorative floral pattern that we perhaps take too much for granted; there is a conceit in Archaic art (it is at least as old as the early seventh century) that plays upon the ornamentality of nature and the na- turalistic values of ornament. The status of the trefoil device planted on the groundline of the neck panel on the great Protoattic am- phora from Eleusis, to cite just one oriental- izing example, hovers ambiguously between vegetation and ornament. On the neck of a Leagros Group hydria in the Louvre, birds strut and flap their wings amid subsidiary pal- mettes and tendrils: the decorative florals are thus treated as "real" vegetation.42 And on an amphora in Boston (MFA 63.952; fig. 4) the topmost of twelve pygmy satyrs cavorting over and through Dionysos' luxuriant vine pauses, wraps one arm around a branch for support, gazes up at the lotus-palmette band, and probes it with his hand, as if he is himself unsure whether to keep on climbing and so carry the vintage out of nature into ornament. At the same time, the ivy that decorates the handles of the amphora echoes the ivy branch the huge god carries over his left shoulder, and our reading of each of these elements thus oscillates between ornamental device and natural form.43 To return to the Paestum diver: the gray- green sea or pool he aims for is not an expanse, but a low mound that rises above the border of the panel - it is a pile of water.44 And in- stead of a colorful, irregular cliff to jump from, there is a tall masonry platform. The emphasis is not on nature or on the youth's relationship to nature: it is on the youth him- self. Both trees and palmettes point to him, and he is out of all proportion to the landscape HURWIT 39</page><page sequence="9">(there just is not enough water for him to dive into without breaking his neck on the border below). The human form and architecture dominate, and natural forms are unconvinc- ing accessories; in the comparison between the two paintings, the Natur gefiihl of the Greek work seems very much the weaker. But the Archaic Greek feeling for nature does not come off so badly if, instead of the Paestum panel, we set beside the Etruscan work a scene on the more nearly contempo- rary vase by the Priam Painter, the Lerici-Ma- rescotti amphora in the Villa Giulia (c. 515- 500) (fig. s).45 Seven nymphs bathe and swim in a grotto,46 the sides of the panel having been converted into rocky walls that tower over the scene.47 Water gushes from natural fountains on each side (two girls wash their hair beneath them, the water cascading over the buttocks of the one on the left). Four nymphs stand on a platform, but the con- structed object does not dominate the scene as it does on the slab of Paestum: instead, the natural and built elements have equal status in the composition. And two trees (olives, probably) grow from near the base of the cliffs.48 Olives or not, they are used as many trees on late-sixth-century vases are - as clothes racks. But the trees are far taller than the human figures, and that alone is remark- able (though hardly unique) for an Archaic work.49 There is one girl in the water; as War- ren Moon has noted, she is slightly smaller than the others on shore, and so seems in the distance. This is a place of some depth. The water, too, is extraordinary: the black glaze has apparently been scraped away to give the impression of a rippling, glistening sea. 50 In short, the nymphs are placed in a coherent and encompassing setting - we feel like voy- eurs - and the artist has boldly attempted ef- fects of scale and even light. Now, there are important differences between this scene and the panoramic seascapes in the Etruscan Tomb of Hunting and Fishing. There is, for example, a far stronger sense of closure in the Greek image: the landscape does not open out laterally into a vast natural continuum but is an enclosed vale cut off from the rest of the world, a sheltered and sheltering concavity. It is a different kind of landscape from the Etruscan, but it is no less a landscape. And the sense of closure the grotto offers, though certainly and persistently appealing to early Greeks (the grotto is not unlike the cove of 4.

Attic black-figure panel amphora by Priam Painter, c. 515-500 b.c., Villa Giulia DAI, Rome Phorkys and the Naiads described in the Od- yssey),51 may have been here a practical choice: the scene, after all, is painted on a panel amphora. As for the relationship of this vase-painting to free painting, it is impossible to say whether the Priam Painter was specifically imitating contemporary murals or panels, and it is in any case wrong to assume auto- matically that the originality of vase-painters was inferior to that of wall- or panel-painters, their products always and necessarily deriv- ative. Still, it is very difficult to believe that an Athenian vase-painter of the late sixth cen- tury could envision and compose a scene like this and that contemporary Greek free paint- ers could not. That is, the Etruscans probably had nothing on them after all: their suppos- edly stronger Natur gefiihl is illusory, a matter of medium and evidence. For it goes without saying that the black- or red-figure vase - with the technical limitations of its color HURWIT 41</page><page sequence="11">scheme, the absence of green and blue from the palette of added colors, and a curving sur- face that insists upon planari ty - is hardly the ideal vehicle for the representation of vege- tation, sea, or land (not to mention atmo- sphere), and should not be compared to wall- paintings, Greek or Etruscan.52 Given the in- herent limitations of the Archaic vase, the wonder is not that there are so few landscape elements in early Greek vase-painting, but so many. The scene on the Lerici-Marescotti am- phora nonetheless comes as something of a particular surprise. For if all the requisites of landscape - rocks and other land forms, trees and other vegetation, and water - had ap- peared before in Archaic art, they had gen- erally appeared (and would continue to appear long after the end of Archaic art) singly and as accessories. An element of landscape could at times play more than one role in an image, but typically it served as one of the following: 1 . A narrative prop. Sisyphos must have a hill to roll his rock up; Sinis needs a pine tree (Munich 8771; fig. 6); Europa, riding to Crete, may actually have the island in sight (Louvre E696; fig. 7); Poseidon may toss (or have tossed) Nisyros at a giant, and so on. Rocks and trees also serve as convenient things for figures, such as the nymphs of the Lerici-Ma- rescotti amphora, the youths of figure 16, and heroes such as Theseus and Herakles, to lay or hang their cloaks, aryballoi, or quivers upon, just as Odysseus hangs Dolon's gear on that tamarisk at Iliad, 10, 465~468.53 2. A symbol of sexuality, arete, immortality, or victory. Palms are particularly useful in this regard, as Helena F. Miller has shown.54 On the Rycroft Painter's calyx krater in To- ledo (Toledo 63.26; fig. 8), for example, the palm behind Achilles has five fronds on each side to four fronds on the tree behind Ajax, the palms serving as signs of Achilles' supe- riority - as scoreboards, in effect - in place of the inscriptions Exekias used on his seminal version of the dice game in the Vatican.55 3. An attribute or symbol of gods, such as Apollo and Artemis (in the case of palms, which may also identify a particular scene as Delos or Delphi) or Dionysos (in the case of vines, which may also place the scene on Naxos).56 Vines, of course, are particularly ap- propriate features in scenes of Dionysiac ac- tivities, such as symposia. 6.

A more blandly topographic device, setting the scene vaguely outdoors, without any nec- essarily narrative or symbolic role to play.57 Trees and rocks, that is, are often the furni- ture of genre. At all events, Archaic vases and reliefs typi- cally present a conventional and minimalist nature, where one tree, rock, or bush, like a prop in a play, could have been enough to denote "forest," "grove," "mountain," or "field": the splendid but solitary shrub in the hare hunt on the Chigi vase does the job, and so does a slender tree on the exterior of a cup by Onesimos in Boston, where it simply rein- forces the idea that the youths and the horse standing before it are outside somewhere.58 But things are different on the Priam Painter's masterpiece in the Villa Giulia, for here those props, those accessories, in combination, have very nearly been converted into the sub- ject of representation, or at least there is a balance and proportion between setting and figure that seems absolutely new. There had been experiments with natural setting before, of course. One striking exper- iment, in fact, took place near the very be- ginning of Archaic image-making, on the panel of a mid-eighth-century krater from Argos (Argos Museum C240; fig. 9). 59 Four branch-wielding dancers appear to emerge out of the distance, above; below, a curious horse tamer reins in his animal on a pebbly beach or riverbank; below that, there is the water itself, zigzagged, Egyptian-style.60 Fit in where there is room are fish and a water- fowl. Men, land, and water are juxtaposed; the creatures are literally fish out of water. But it is precisely the combination of these natural forms, however discrete, that makes the scene, for its time, almost as remarkable as the Priam Painter's grotto. There would be nothing quite like the Ar- give scene again for over two centuries, but in the meantime there were other experi- ments. There are, of course, the rocks on the Argive Polyphemus fragment (Argos Museum C149; fig. 10) - a scene that is usually con- sidered an imitation of a wall- or panel-paint- ing - and a rocky couch becomes a regular feature of the iconography of the myth later.61 On a Corinthian skyphos in the Louvre the cave of Pholos is shown as a crescentlike ov- erhang,62 and at Olympia Pausanias saw on the Chest of Kypselos one scene of a man and woman sleeping in a grotto, and another panel with Dionysos "lying down in a cave. . . .

Argos, Archaeological Museum; photograph: Ecole française d'Athènes trees, and pomegranate trees."63 Brief indi- cations of vineyard and setting are found on many of the early-sixth-century plaques from Pente Skouphia,64 but the scene on the clay- digger plaque (Berlin F871; fig. 11) is more than summary: the artist has dispensed with the fixed horizontal baseline, and the irreg- ular ground supports figures at different heights. The way the figures are enclosed by rising ground, in fact, seems to anticipate the high rock walls of the Priam Painter's scene - it is another landscape of closure. An- other familiar example of an atypically ex- tensive Archaic setting appears on the well- known name-piece of the Painter of the Vat- ican Mourner (c. 540-530), where a goddess (Eos or Europa) mourns her dead son (Mem- non or Sarpedon) amid four trees - a veritable forest by Archaic standards.65 The hero lies on branches below two firs, his armor is set against two plane trees. The contrast is be- 1 1 . Corinthian pinax, c. 600-575 B.C. Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Antikensammlung 44 H U R W I T</page><page sequence="14">io. Fragment of bowl, c. 650 B.C.

The olive tree on the eponymous Acropolis pediment is an- other example,67 and so is that eternally con- troversial East Greek cup in the Louvre - the "Nest Robber" or "Master of the Trees" cup - where, whoever the man is, the supple, large-leafed trees and the variety of creatures found among the branches suggest the lush- ness of nature.68 The Priam Painter's truly remarkable con- cern for setting did not, then, appear out of nowhere. And it was not unique, either. In the last decades of the sixth century and the first decades of the fifth, the Archaic artist's interest in landscape elements noticeably in- creases. There are just a lot more rocks, trees, and oceans now, even if it is true that many examples show the same rock - a roughly square or rectangular form with white edges or undulating white and black bands in black- figure (MMA 56.171.33; figs. 12-13), 69 a bul- bous outcropping with dilute swirls and hol- lows in red-figure (figs. 6, 14, f. Paul Getty Museum, 86AE, 607)70 - and that many vases are so loaded with impossibly elongated branches, floating vines, and desiccated trees that they often lose their evocative value and become elegant filler, there to connect or bracket figures (like the cattle of Gery on on Euphronios' cup in Munich) or to accentuate the lines of composition.71 But there are also many more scenes that attempt to place fig- ures in a larger, more complex setting. The experiments are not always completely suc- cessful, and they are not always Attic. A hu- morous Caeretan hydria shows Apollo's cat- tle emerging from one oddly tree-topped grotto while Apollo confronts that coy thief, baby Hermes, in another.72 On the Chalki- dian Phineus Cup in Würzburg (Würzburg L.i 64; fig. 15), Dionysos and Ariadne ride to- ward a fountainhouse and grapevine,- peeping satyrs approach three nymphs bathing be- tween two palm trees, one of which is set amid thick ivy; and the sons of Boreas chase 12-13.

On a hydria (Cabinet des Mé- dailles 2 5 5 ; fig. 1 7 ), 79 a member of the Leagros Group painted Herakles wrestling Nereus at the seashore: dilute brushstrokes suggest the wavy irregularity and highlights of the sea; a leaping fish is painted pure black above the waterline, dilute below, and so seems half im- mersed in the water; at left, placed incon- gruously among the figures, is a thin tree that suggests the shore on which the contest takes place (on the right, branches stream in from behind the border).

(MMA 41.162.29; fig. 18). The Ambrosios Painter painted a genre scene (MFA 01.8024; fig. 19) that, despite some oddities, compares well enough with the Etruscan image of fishing at Tarquinia.80 And in the tondo of a cup in Mal- ibu the Brygos Painter gives us our first peb- bly beach since the Geometric Argive frag- ment.81 We could go on, perhaps, until we reach a semi-outline lekythos in Athens from the Bowdoin Workshop with a hunter chasing hares over a rising, rocky, wooded land- scape,82 or another lekythos in Athens by the Beldam Painter with its puzzling seascape (Athens 487; figs. 20-22): a ship emerges from behind a rocky island or coast on which men torture captives and dunk them in a dilute and turbulent sea. This vase may well date to the second quarter of the fifth century,83 but if so it should be taken, I think, not simply as a re- flection of contemporary Early Classical de- velopments in free painting but as the cul- mination of extensive Late Archaic experi- ment.84 For still well before the end of the Archaic period, we hear of our first landscape in a Greek panel painting. According to Her- odotus (IV.88), Mandrokles of Samos, the ar- chitect of Darius' boat-bridge over the Bos- porus, took part of his reward and "having a picture painted of the entire bridging of the Bosporus, of King Darius enthroned above, and of the army crossing it, dedicated it in the temple of Hera." The painting must have specified the peculiarities of the setting: the bridge, of course, but also the headlands at either end and "the fish-filled Bosporus" (as Mandrokles himself called it in his dedicatory inscription) in between - probably there was the same compositional principle of sea flanked by tall rocks, the same sense of lateral closure, that we find on the Priam Painter's amphora (fig. 5 ) or later on the Siren Painter's name-vase in London.85 It is noteworthy, in any case, that this lost Greek landscape was inspired not by topophilia, but - like Assyr- ian landscapes, the later painting of Marathon in the Stoa Poikile, and, for that matter, the landscapes on the Column of Trajan - by the historical or documentary impulse, by the de- sire to commemorate an event in which the landscape itself played a critical role. The scene on the Priam Painter's Lerici- Marescotti amphora thus is only one - if the 18. Attic white-ground lekythos by Sappho Painter, c. 500-475 b.c.

National Archaeological Museum, Athens most successful one - of a series of attempts at describing landscape and setting in Late Ar- chaic art. But two palm trees, one painted by Exekias (Boulogne 558; fig. 23), the other by the Kleophrades Painter (Naples 2422; fig. 24), more or less bracketing the last half-cen- tury of the Archaic period,86 show that some- thing else is happening as well. Like other palms, they may symbolize immortality, arete, victory, or Apollo, or even set the scene at Troy (though that is unlikely).87 But, as I have argued elsewhere, they are stylistically like no other palms in Archaic art (compare figs. 8 and 15), and they do something no other landscape elements ever do: they re- spond to the heroic or tragic predicament with human feeling.88 The palm behind Ajax droops its thin, spiritless fronds in sympathy for the hero who is about to die: it weeps like a willow. The palm in the Kleophrades Pain- ter's Ilioupersis arches itself over a mourning Trojan woman, seemingly mourning with her, a grim symbol of despair and brutality, but itself a battered victim, too.89 These palms are, perhaps, Archaic precedents for the dead tree of the Alexander Mosaic, whose life- lessness sets much of the tone of the violent scene played out beneath it: like our palms and several other trees in Late Archaic art, it is mood topography.90 But in any case the palm trees of Exekias and the Kleophrades Painter seem to diminish the distance be- tween human beings and nature that we find in the Iliad, in the Sapphic lyrics with which we began, and in the rest of Archaic art.91 For the first time, the Archaic mind has stopped conceiving of nature as "other" and has begun to imagine that nature may not be indifferent to human beings after all, that it may sym- pathize. The Late Archaic discovery or in- vention of the pathetic fallacy is a big step, for it means that nature can now be addressed and invoked, and that prepares for the great apostrophes of Aeschylus' Prometheus and Sophocles' Philoctetes and Ajax.92 If responses to nature are more culturally determined than individual or instinctive, it is fair to ask whether the nature of the polis - one of the more powerful of Archaic cultural determinants - had something to do with the absence of landscape from most of Archaic art. Robin Osborne, for example, has recently suggested that it was in the best interests of the polis to "repress" the rural landscape that was so vital to its well-being, that "it was essential to the nature of the city that the HURWIT 51</page><page sequence="21">23- Attic black-figure belly amphora by Exekias, c. 530 B.C. After Ernst Pfuhl, Malerei und Zeichnung der Griechen (Munich, 1923), fig. 234 countryside should be . . . unmentioned" in literature and in art unseen, as if the mere representation of rural scenes, by calling to mind the centrality of the country in the life and economy of the polis, would somehow undermine the structure of society.93 But if Osborne is right about the cultural repression or suppression of the country, it is perhaps curious that there is, at least in earlier Ar- chaic art, no corresponding promotion of the town - so few cityscapes, and no scene (so far as I know) of actual building, no representa- tion of the kind of corporate effort that gave physical expression to the city-state.94 Where we are told to detect a repression of the coun- tryside on behalf of the town, we find the asty itself in art only with difficulty: there is no general promotion of urban life. And if scenes of farming and country life are not particu- larly bountiful themselves, there are perhaps more of them than we have a right to expect given both the place of production and one of the primary functions of the typical black- or red-figure vase - a luxury item made in the city to display the mythological learning and sophistication of the urban elite and sympo- siast.95 The theory of the repression of the countryside makes virtually subversive doc- uments of the Antimenes Painter's olive har- vest in London96 or the scene of a cow suck- ling her calf in Brussels,97 or Nikosthenes' cup in Berlin with scenes of plowing, sowing, and hunting,-98 and I think that unlikely. We must in any case distinguish between scenes of rural life, on the one hand, and the depic- tion of landscape elements, on the other: the alleged conspiracy against the actual, work- ing countryside does not explain the lack of natural setting in the mythological narratives the urban elite preferred in order to show off its good taste, at least before the last decades of the sixth century. Is it possible, then, that changes in the polis, especially the Athenian polis, had something to do with the minor eruption of landscape elements, rural genre scenes, and sympathetic palm trees at the end of the Ar- chaic period? Could it be that the growth or concentration of Late Archaic Athens in par- ticular caused a revision in its attitude toward its landscape, encouraging the formation of artificial relationships with nature? Such re- lationships could be seen, for example, in the emergence of the artificial countrysides and environmental ideals known as gymnasia (the Academy, Kynosarges, and the Lykeion 52 HURWIT</page><page sequence="22">24 .

Soprintendenza Archeologia delle Province di Napoli e Caserte may all have been formalized in the late sixth century, creating, with their groves and springs, a kind of "green belt" at Athens' out- skirts).99 Did the rising cults of Dionysos and (at the very end of the period) Pan imagina- tively supply or invent the pure kind of wil- derness that no longer existed, if it ever had, in the actual Archaic landscape of Attica? 100 Could it be that with an intensification of life in the Late Archaic city101 the otherness and putative distance of nature expressed in Ar- chaic poetry was no longer affordable, and that artificial means of making contact with it - including the first tentative expressions of the pathetic fallacy - had therefore to be devised? Heraclitus' theory of contraries stated, "It is disease that makes health sweet and good, hunger satiety, weariness rest."102 Perhaps he should have added that it is the city that makes the countryside attractive.103 And yet there are problems here, too. The representation of nature for its own sake still does not exist in Late Archaic art. Few if any real places are anywhere depicted.104 And landscape per se never becomes the sole ob- ject of contemplation: it is always subordi- nate to narrative, and isolated landscape ele- ments continue to fulfill their traditional nar- rative, localizing, and symbolic functions down to the Hellenistic period. Nature is still no imaginative escape,- resentfulness toward the town is still unfelt. Late Archaic Athens was not Hellenistic Alexandria, much less seventeenth-century Amsterdam or nine- teenth-century London, and the Greeks never became Romantics. If the ideological de- mands of the polis cannot be held chiefly re- sponsible for the neglect of landscape in ear- lier Archaic art, its changing character cannot be held chiefly responsible for the somewhat greater frequency of landscape elements at the period's end. For an increasing alienation HURWIT 53</page><page sequence="23">25- Attic red-figure kylix by Kleomelos Painter, c. 500 B.C. J. Paul Getty Museum, Malibu of the city from the landscape does not ex- plain why Late Archaic artists now become almost as interested in the depiction of ar- chitecture - fountainhouses above all (fig. 1 6), but other structures, too - as in the de- piction of grottoes and seashores. IOS The fea- tures of urban environments - the built com- ponents of the world - attract them as well. It may be, then, that what we should note in Late Archaic art is not a new interest in land- scape as such, but in setting, in the placing of the human figure on a larger stage, in larger contexts of various sorts - in complex envi- ronments like the one on the Lerici-Mares- cotti amphora (fig. 5 ), where, at the center of the large grotto, there is that constructed plat- form, where natural and human-built ele- ments are complementary.106 It is difficult to say why setting should be- come more important just now - we do not yet find explicit statements, like Xenophon's later, of the smallness of man in relation to the cosmos, a mere bit of earth and moisture out of the mass that exists.107 Factors such as an increased scientific interest in the physical properties of the phenomenal world and a cer- tain Late Archaic de-deification of nature - all things were no longer quite so full of gods - may have contributed to the increase of landscape elements in art.108 So may have 54 HURWIT</page><page sequence="24">the generally greater Late Archaic interest in genre, and so, just possibly, may have the rise of tragedy and scenery in the late sixth cen- tury, though, of course, we do not hear spe- cifically of scene-painting until later.109 But it is perhaps worth noting that although there are a few Late Archaic red-figure images that explore unusual settings for human action (for example, combats taking place before or below citadel walls [J. Paul Getty Museum 84.AE.38; fig. 2 5 J),1 10 complex setting - that is, the depiction of environments containing more than a single tree or rock or architec- tural element - is simply more common in black-figure than in red, and that the repre- sentation of place (and of places that some- times extend behind the frame and beyond the limits of the field) was really the only pos- sible response black-figure could make in the face of red-figure's superior ability to show individual figures generating their own three- dimensional space.111 The response was mi- metic, an expression of a broader concern for imitating spatial relationships between fig- ures and between figures and environment. The motivation was not to displace the human figure from the center of representa- tion, or to diminish the status of the figure, but to describe the fields of human activity in greater detail - to create, in effect, human- scapes. For, in the end, it is still the human figure that counts. If I have here stressed the lesser component of Archaic art, suggesting that the Archaic artist's repertoire and use of land- scape elements and setting were more exten- sive and varied than we normally think, that they were particularly so in the last few de- cades of the period, and that it was against this background of Late Archaic experiment that Classical developments (however lim- ited they still were) must be viewed, land- scape never threatens the real subject of Ar- chaic art. And if, over all, the Archaic Greek attitude toward nature still seems excep- tional in the ancient Mediterranean, we do well to remember that Greek anthropocen- trism was exceptional, too.112 NOTES Many scholars kindly supplied photographs or were instrumental in their acquisition: I am especially in- debted to G.

F. de Polignac, La naissance de la cité grecque (Paris, 1984), 41-89, has argued that the establishment of a major sanctuary in the countryside, as a kind of polar opposite to a sanctuary in the city, was a com- mon element in the self-definition of the Archaic state, in its marking out of spatial boundaries between nature and culture. 13. See also Rhys Carpenter, The Esthetic Basis of Greek Art (Bloomington, Ind., 1959), 24: "From the striking absence of [Greek] landscape scenes, whether of forest or cornland or olive groves or rocky shores or pine-covered heights, no conclusion may be drawn as to the sentiments of the ancient people who lived in that (still today) marvellously beautiful country- side." Anthony M. Snodgrass, An Archaeology of Greece (Berkeley, 1987), 69, believes he could make the case that the Greeks lacked any "response to the beauty of rural scenery," but he does not do so. 14.

Elliger, Die Darstel- lung der Landschaft in der griechischen Dichtung, Untersuchungen zur antiken Literatur und Ge- schichte 15 (Berlin, 1975). Still, it is surprising how rarely an Archaic poet comes right out and says a landscape or portion of a landscape is "beautiful." It happens in the Iliad, where the groves of the nymphs are called kala (20, 8); in the Theogony, where the haunts of the nymphs are "grace- ful" or "lovely" ( kharientas , 129), and where rivers are called "beautiful" or "fair-flowing" ( kallireeth - ron, 339, eureitèn, 343); and in the early Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite, where nymphs haunt the "beau- tiful groves" [alsea kala, 97) and the "beautiful moun- tain" ( kaloň oros, 98) of Ida. And Sappho's word for the apple grove and meadow of Aphrodite (Fr. 2 LP) is "lovely" ( kharien ). These may be exceptions that prove some rule or other; at least they prove that nymphs and Aphrodite liked beautiful spots. 20. In Pindar's Paean 4, for example, the love of the Keans for their land is clear enough. 21. Iliad, 16, 297-302 (trans. Robert Fitzgerald). 22. A powerful cross-current is the quintessen tially anthropocentric notion that the only beautiful - or at least only good - landscape is a useful landscape. In the Odyssey, that nature is best that mortals exploit. This, I think, is implicit in the Odyssey's contrast between Calypso's and Alkinoos' gardens. The beauty of Calypso's place (5, 63-74), luxuriant but untended, stuns Hermes - its beauty is of a sort to be appreciated by gods - but it is no source of delight to our mortal hero: while Hermes gazes his fill, Odysseus sits on the shore looking seaward, his back to the landscape (5, 151). When, like Hermes, Odysseus gazes his fill at a landscape (7, 1 12-132), it is at the neatly plotted, fenced-in gardens of Alkinoos, the site of human in- dustry (the vintage is under way). It is a landscape that mortals have shaped, and it is the benefits the orchards yield that are the source of his delight. Odysseus ad- mires the deserted island off Cyclopsland (9, 116-141) from this same utilitarian perspective: its "beauty" lies in its untapped potential for exploitation. And this is the root of Odysseus' topophilia toward his own rocky Ithaca itself. It is not so beautiful a place and is fit for goats rather than horses, but it provides the necessities of life, and both Odysseus and Telemachus are inordinately attached to it (4, 601-608; 9, 25-36; 13, 242-249). The sentiment that is topophilia may have practical rather than aesthetic roots; and this utilitarian attitude, which also seems to lie behind Archilochos' preference for the lovely plains of Siris over wild- wooded, ass-backed Thasos (Fr. 18 Diehl; Athenaeus 12.523d), survives at least down to Plato's Cri tias, where the beauty of mountains resides not in their sublimity but in their potential for providing sustenance and raw materials (118B). 23. Iliad, 17, 548. The contrast with Genesis 9:12-17 could not be stronger, of course, and it is the Old Tes- tament attitude that prevails - for example, in Words- worth's poem of 1807 that begins "My heart leaps up when I behold / A rainbow in the sky."

Redfield, Nature and Culture in the Iliad: The Tragedy of Hec- tor (Chicago, 1975), 188-192. Even in the Odyssey, where nature emerges from the world of reference to become the setting for the narrative, the sea - one-half of the natural world - is of course the hero's greatest obstacle and source of fear; even the god Hermes is reluctant to cross its bitter and unspeakable expanse (5, 100- 10 1 ). For the broad Archaic perception of the natural world as mysterious, and of man as helpless before it, see also Charles P. Segal, "Nature and the World of Man in Greek Literature," Arion 2 (1963], 19-53, who points out that the idea of nature's es- sential hostility survives at least down to Sophocles (42)- The general perception of rugged nature as hostile seems explicit in the names the Greeks gave to some of their mountains: Ptoon (Terrifying), Keraunia (Thunder- smitten), Mainalon (Wild or Mad Place), or Tymphrestus (Whirlwind). But, as W. W. Hyde noted, such etymologies do not tell the whole story; see his "Ancient Appreciation of Mountain Scenery," CJ 11 (1915), 70-84. 28. Harmony between man and nature exists, for the most part, only after nature has first been submitted to human will through cultivation. Thus Hesiod (who earlier says "the earth is full of evils, and so is the sea") can feel some sympathy for nature when both are buffeted by winter [Works and Days, 101 and 504- 563), and thus he, as perhaps no other Archaic poet, can think of himself in nature, in a rhetorical (the mood is optative) and rudimentary locus amoenus ( Works and Days, 582-596). The importance of this last passage, however, is the emphasis it places upon the comfort of Hesiod; it is anthropocentric in focus and does not really describe the setting in detail; see Bonnafé 1984, 83 and 246-248. In his Cologne epode ( PCol 75 11), Archilochos, or his persona, seduces a girl in a flowery meadow, but it is the conventional "meadow of love" found throughout Archaic poetry (above, note 3), and so its reality is called into question. 29.

I do not claim a scientific accounting, but a ran- dom sample is at least suggestive.

Their index lists 4 works with rocks, 4 with palm trees, and 17 with other sorts of trees (1 or 2 more, such as Cat. 1484, can be added); there are pos- sibly 3 other works with vineyard scenes (Cat. 219, 1 07 1, 1483), for a total of around 29 works with true landscape elements, or about 1.5 percent of the total. Even if one includes the 119 listed pieces with vines (many of them with no discernible connection to the ground and thus probably hand-held), the percentage of the total is still only 7.5 percent. And of the 42 non- Panathenaic amphorae published by von Bothmer in CVA, USA 12, Metropolitan Museum , fase. 3: Attic Black-Figured Amphorae, only two (4 1.162. 17 6, 17.230.7) depict any landscape elements at all - they are both small rocks - for a percentage of 4.8 percent. 34.

See, for example, Henri Frankfort, The Art and Architecture of the Ancient Orient (Harmondsworth, 1970), figs. 91, 192, 201, 206, and 209. The example of Near Eastern landscapes in particular suggests that topophilia is not a necessary precondition for the rep- resentation of the natural world. There may be artistic landscapes that serve primarily a documentary im- pulse by publicizing, detailing, and glorifying the con- quest of foreign territories. The imperial idea fosters the comprehensive depiction of topography or local- ity, but the landscape is, very often, someone else's. In short, if topophilia may exist in a culture without engendering artistic landscapes, landscapes may exist in the art of a people without necessarily reflecting its own experience or appreciation of topophilia. 37. See, for example, Sinclair Hood, The Arts in Pre- historic Greece (Harmondsworth, 1978), figs. 140, 155, 31-33, 34, 179, 160-163, 36, and 47. This is not the place to examine differences among Minoan, Theran, and Mycenaean attitudes toward na- HURWIT 57</page><page sequence="27">ture, and any argument would necessarily hinge on such difficult issues as attribution, patronage, defi- nition, and influence. It is true that detailed land- scapes are harder to come by in Mycenaean art (though the corpus of Mycenaean frescoes is smaller, too), and as a result the Mycenaeans are generally supposed to have been less sensitive to nature and less interested in its representation than the Minoans and Therans, who until recently have come across more or less as "flower children" in modern scholarship. To be sure, a comparison between, say, the so-called Spring fresco from Akrotiri or the Partridge frieze from the Cara- vanserai (see Hood 1978, figs. 40-41), and the (heavily reconstructed) Blue Bird frieze from Pylos (see Mabel L. Lang, The Palace of Nestor at Pylos in Western Messenia, II: The Frescoes [Princeton, 1969] pl. R, 9 F nws) does indeed seem to reveal a far different sen- sibility: the landscape on the mainland work is di- vided up into outposts or clumps, and the birds dom- inate by their sheer size and stereotyped pose. The frieze is more an exercise in ornament than in natural depiction: the birds are not placed in nature, but be- side it, juxtaposed to it. But the Mycenaean artist may not have been completely indifferent to the represen- tation of landscape: a carefully rendered olive tree (of which even a Minoan would have been proud) and colorful rockwork that recalls that of the Theran Spring fresco were also painted on the walls of the palace at Pylos (see Lang 1969, pl. Q, 3, 10 N nws). It may be that the Mycenaean had a variety of stylistic options from which to choose. For that matter, not every Minoan or Theran fresco contains lush images of nature, and Minoan/Theran backgrounds can also be nearly abstract. 38. See, for example, Martin Robertson, A History of Greek Art (Cambridge, 1975), 240-241; and Larissa Bonfante, ed., Etruscan Life and Afterlife: A Hand- book of Etruscan Studies (Detroit, 1986), 168. 39. See Otto J. Brendel, Etruscan Art (Harmonds- worth, 1978), 190, and Maja Sprenger, Gilda Barto- lom, and Max and Albert Hirmer, The Etruscans: Their History, Art, and Architecture, trans. Robert Erich Wolf (New York, 1983), 103-104. The first chamber, too, has "naturalistic" scenes of dancers be- neath tall trees; see Brendel 1978, fig. 123 and 187- 188. 40.

Jackson, East Greek Influence on Attic Vases (London, 1976), 76- 77, for other examples of East Greek and Attic vases on which subsidiary florals are populated with birds and animals. 43. Similarly, when, as often happens on black-figure vases, large decorative palmettes creep on their ten- drils into images that already include representations of landscape elements such as trees, are we to take them as purely "decorative" after all? Can we so read- ily accept the "naturalism" of the trees? See, for ex- ample, the late black-figure neck-amphora in the J. Paul Getty Museum, S.80.AE.65 (Bareiss 134), illus- trated in Greek Vases in the J. Paul Getty Museum, 2 (Malibu, 1985), 217 (fig. 36), or the Cactus Painter's lekythos in Berlin (inv. 3261), where decorative ten- drils come alive and intertwine with the serpent and the trunk and branches of the apple tree of the Hes- perides; see C.H.E. Haspels, Attic Black-Figured Lek- ythoi (Paris, 1936), pl. 18, 1. 44. A similar pile of water appears earlier in the The- seus scene on the neck of the François vase; see John Boardman, Athenian Black Figure Vases (New York, 1974), fig. 46.4. This scene, coincidentally perhaps, has something in common with a scene on a bronze band from Balawat, where porters wade ashore from boats; see Frankfort 1970, 165, fig. 191. 45. My debt to Warren G. Moon's fine discussion of this and other vases in "The Priam Painter: Some Iconographie and Stylistic Considerations," in An- cient Greek Art and Iconography, ed. Warren G. Moon (Madison, 1983), 97-118, is clear. One should note, too, that the comparison between the Tarquinian and Paestum paintings ignores the fact that the seascape in the Tomb of Hunting and Fishing is extraordinary even for Etruscan art (and, inciden- tally, that some scholars have thought it influenced by East Greek styles; see Massimo Pallottino, Etrus- can Painting [New York, 1952], 52, and Sprenger, Bar- tolom, and Hirmer 1983, 104). It is true that trees, bushes, and groves are painted regularly on the walls of Archaic and Early Classical Etruscan tombs, and that figures dance and play joyfully among them. But the typical Etruscan fresco does not do much more than juxtapose or alternate figures and vegetation in what Brendel 1978, 197, calls a "metopic" fashion: the figures are as tall as the trees, and there is rarely any greater attempt to describe environment. There are a few Archaic Greek vase paintings that do as well (Lou- vre F 162, by the Gela Painter, seems a Greek vase- painter's version of such a scene; see Haspels 1936, pl. 25, 7). 46. That the women are nymphs rather than mortal girls or maenads seems clear on several counts: there is an obvious numerical correspondence between them and the seven midget satyrs on the reverse of the vase (Moon 1983, fig. 7.i8a-c); nudity is usually prohibited for mortal women (except courtesans) at this date (the female swimmers on the Andokides Painter's amphora, Louvre F 203, are almost certainly Amazons); maenads are never shown nude; and the clothes and equipment hung on the trees of the scene are not maenadic. For the distinctions between nymphs and maenads, see Mark W. Edwards, "Rep- resentation of Maenads on Archaic Red-Figure Vases," JHS 80(1960), 80-81, and Albert Henrichs, "Myth Vis- ualized: Dionysos and His Circle in Sixth- Century Attic Vase-Painting," in Papers on theAmasis Painter and His World (Malibu, 1987), 92-124, especially 100-102; also, Sheila McNally, "The Maenad in Early Greek Art," Arethusa 11 (1978), 101-135. For the view that the women on the Priam Painter's vase are indeed 58 HURWIT</page><page sequence="28">mortal, see Claude Bérard et al., A City of Images: Iconography and Society in Ancient Greece (Prince- ton, 1989), 93. 47. The slanted rather than purely vertical right side of the Paestum lid (fig. 3) can also be read as a cliff rising by the sea, with a tree growing outward from its face. 48. The Priam Painter, like many Late Archaic artists, did not bother much about botanical distinctions: the gnarly trunks of the trees are identical to those of the vines painted on the other side of the vase (Moon 1983, fig. 7.i8a-c). 49. Among other tall trees are those in figure 16 and the one Peleus has climbed on the white-ground oin- ochoe by the Painter of London B 620 in New York (Metropolitan Museum 46.11.7); see Boardman 1974, fig. 230. 50. Moon, in "Some New and Little-Known Vases by the Rycroft and Priam Painters/7 in Malibu 1985, 41- 70, especially 63 n. 45, corrects his earlier statement (Moon 1983, 113) that "applied white slip was used to indicate the breeze-blown water." The Priam Pain- ter's treatment of the water is still extraordinary, though there had been earlier "painterly" experi- ments. On the shoulder of a hydria of the mid-century Kleimachos Group (Louvre E 735; ABV, 85/2), for ex- ample, a ship sails over a sea rendered in dilute, and the visible brushstrokes suggest the irregularity of the waves; see P. de la Coste-Messelière, Au Musée de Delphes (Paris, 1936), pl. 13. 51. Odyssey, 13,96-112,344-351. 52. So, too, if all we had left of the Archaic Etruscans were their reliefs and painted pots - the principal sources of evidence for Archaic Greek representa- tional attitudes - they would hardly seem more en- amored of the natural world than their Greek contem- poraries. Would we have guessed they could decorate the Tomb of Hunting and Fishing the way they did even if we had such works as the Micali Painter's am- phora in London (Brendel 1978, figs. 129-130) before us? Should we not therefore entertain the possibility that the Archaic Greek depiction of landscape in the virtually lost genre of free painting was fuller than the evidence of the Archaic vase suggests? Now, it is true that the Lerici-Marescotti amphora was exported to Etruria (it was found at Cerveteri), and this raises the possibility that it was decorated with Etruscan tastes or funerary beliefs in mind. But that would not explain why the Priam Painter's scene should be so very dif- ferent from the vast majority of scenes on other Greek vases that also found their way to Etruria: if the Ar- chaic Greek vase-painter had identified an Etruscan market for landscapes, we should have more of them than we do. In short, I am not convinced that the Etruscan feeling for nature was any more developed than the Archaic Greek or, therefore, that exported vases with extensive landscape elements or rural scenes were decorated that way just to satisfy Etrus- can tastes. 53.

Hedreen for pointing out to me that many of the vines and arbors on Archaic vases may represent Dionysos' Nax- ian vineyard; the vine on the Foundry Painter's cup, Tarquinia RC 5291 ( Paralipomena , 370, 23bis; John Boardman, Athenian Red Figure Vases : The Archaic Period [London, 1975], fig. 269), certainly does. See also Guy Michael Hedreen, "The Silens of Naxos," AfA 92 (1988), 256-257. 57. The tree before which Herakles so often wrestles the lion might possibly be shorthand for the grove at the sanctuary of Zeus at Nemea, but it is not certain; and the tree depicted in scenes of Theseus fighting the Marathonian bull seems to be there on the Heraklean model, not because it specifies the locale. With Darice Birge, Sacred Groves in the Ancient Greek World (diss., University of California at Berkeley, 1982), 4, "we may conclude that depictions of heroes battling wild animals under the open sky included a tree to set the general scene only." 58.

Water appears much the same way between two waterfowl on the shoulder of a Late Geometric Attic oinochoe in Athens; see Human Figure, 66 (Cat. 5). It should be noted that in Egyptian representations of water, the zigzags are usually aligned vertically, not stacked horizontally, as in Geometric Greek images. 61. See, for example, Boardman 1974, fig. 248 (Louvre F 342). Another early polychrome experiment in the representation of nature is (apparently) the dark brown and leafless tree that stands against a lighter brown background on a fragmentary terracotta pinax that may have decorated the interior of the early-seventh- century Temple of Apollo at Corinth.

Black-figure rocks often seem like black-and- white versions of the colorfully banded islands of the Etruscan Tomb of Hunting and Fishing (figs. 1-2). 70. The Onesimos kylix in the Getty will be pub- lished by Dyfri Williams, and I thank Marion True for permission to illustrate it here. One should note the rock's phallic, almost engorged, character; like the full and phallic wineskin hung in the field above, it seems a party to the (for once, limp) satyr's looming sexual assault, pinning the sleeping and vulnerable maenad beneath it. The rock, in other words, is something more than just a rock for the satyr to creep along: it is innuendo. 71. Munich 2620; ARV2 16/17-, see Schefold 1978, fig. 148, and L. G.

The odd configuration of the rising sea may also have been con- ditioned by the presence of the checkered wall of the fountainhouse in the adjoining Dionysos scene; the wall of water provides a slightly less jarring transition to the next scene than if the sea had been low all the way across. It provides a kind of closure. On the exterior of an Attic black-figure cup in the British Museum (B 436), merchant vessels and war- ships sail over a sea that is deeper near the handles than at the sides - an unusual but, I think, successful attempt to suggest sea swells; see Boardman 1974, fig. 180. 74. Beazley 1986, 74, notes, "The figures are com- paratively small, and the picture comes a little nearer to being a real landscape than in the many vases where the figures dwarf the buildings" (or, we might add, the trees). 75.

The exact relationship to the sea of the rock on which the boy squats is not clear: it may be an ov- erhang, but then one would not expect to find the oc- topus clinging to it below. If the lower portion is meant to be below water, the artist ought to have con- tinued the water line across the rock. The way three tentacles of the typically symmetrical octopus curve out of sight around the rock adds to the spatiality of the scene, but it is the same sort of device often found on shields in Late Archaic vase-painting; see figure 25, and the cup by Phintias (Athens, National Museum 1628) in Human Figure, 140-141 (Cat. 50). 81.

See Haspels 1936, 171, where the vase is dated to around 470. 84. Beth Cohen, "Paragone: Sculpture Versus Paint- ing, Kaineus and the Kleophrades Painter," in Moon 1983, 1 71-192, similarly suggests that the revolution in wall- and panel-painting that we usually associate with Polygnotos and Mikon and usually date to the late 470s may have begun around or even before 480, and that the revolution was really "the final fruit in the evolution of Archaic style" (177-179). 85. British Museum E 440; ARV2, 289/ 1; Boardman 1975, % 184- 86. There is general agreement that Exekias' vase should date to around 530. The Kleophrades Painter's Vivenzio hydria is now dated by some (and with un- common precision) to the year or two immediately after the Persian sack of the Acropolis (to which it 60 H U R W I T</page><page sequence="30">would then mythologically refer) in 480.

Anum- ber of similes in the Iliad again present natural scenes or phenomena as analogues for human emotion (see above, note 26), and so the steps Exekias and the Kleo- phrades Painter took were not completely unprepared for in poetry. It is true as well that, once, an Archaic poet actually sympathizes with nature; see above, note 28. 89. See also Robertson 1975, 234. 90. On the name-piece of the Beldam Painter (Athens 1 129) there is another unusual palm: satyrs have bound a grotesque woman to it, and proceed to torture her. With its spiky, sharp fronds, the palm almost seems an instrument of torture itself - at least, it sug- gests the brutality of the scene. See Boardman 1974, fig. 277, and Haspels 1936, pl. 49, and 170- 171, where the lekythos is dated "not . . . much earlier than 470"; Miller 1979, 143, dates the vase more broadly to "ca. 490-460." Something similarly moody is going on on the lekythos in Berlin by the Cactus Painter, where the apple tree of the Hesperides helps create a mood of agitation and danger; see above, note 43, and Nelson 1977/ 54: "the tree branches reach out toward Hera- kles in a threatening way, and the frenzied palmettes and tendrils twist around the body of Herakles as if to entrap him." 9 1 . Even on the amphora by the Painter of the Vatican Mourner (above, note 65), the grove, for all its sym- bolism, stands as a foil to human suffering. It is note- worthy, too, that on the Vatican vase the helmet of the hero looks away, while Ajax's seems a witness to the imminent suicide. 92.

Robin Osborne, Classical Landscape with Fig- ures: The Ancient Greek City and Its Countryside (Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., 1987), 16, 197. Osborne quickly rejects the idea that ancient authors "took the coun- tryside for granted because it was so universally im- portant," suggesting that the landscapes of Greece are too varied for that and so "cannot be assumed as a constant known factor" (16). But surely the rhythm of small plain or valley and wall of mountain around it was basic to any Greek conception of landscape; more specifically, the landscape of Athens was surely a constant for Athenians, as that of Corinth for Cor- inthians. Moreover, I am not sure why even the va- riety of rural landscapes that Greece as a whole pos- sesses would preclude perception of them as "univer- sally important." In any case, Old Comedy did not repress the beauties and pleasures of country life; see R. Vischer, Das einfache Leben (Göttingen, 1965), 58- 59, 1 31-132, and Rosenmeyer 1969, 208. 94. And just as a single tree may stand for a whole grove, so a single column or two may stand for an entire temple or building. The Archaic artist brought to the depiction of both rural landscape and urban ar- chitecture an attitude of abbreviation. 95.

Tuan 1974, 1 1 3-1 14, notes that we can often come close to the environmental ideal of a people or culture by examining its "idea of the world beyond death." Before the end of the Archaic period, the Greek notion of what Elysium or the Isles of the Blessed looked like is very imprecise. But it is interesting that in Pindar's description, the Isle of the Blessed seems a lot like a gymnasium : it is a space before the city, with flowery meadows and fruit trees, where the blessed play games, exercise, make music, and sacrifice; see C. M. Bowra, Pindari Carmina (Oxford, 1947), frag. 114. 100. For the rise of the cults of Dionysos and Pan, see Osborne 1987, 189-192. Homer distinguished between the domesticated plain and the agrou ep' eskhatien, "the land beyond the limit of agriculture"; see Redfield 1975, 189-190, and Odyssey 4, 5 17, 5, 489. But the agrou ep' eskhatien was not quite "the wild world of nature" that Ian Mor- ris, Burial and Ancient Society: The Rise of the Greek City-State (Cambridge, 1987), 192, calls it: it is grazing land, seasonally occupied by herdsmen, and is thus between culture and raw nature. For the absence of Greek wilderness, even on the tops of mountains (where there were many shrines), see Clarence J. Glacken, Traces on the Rhodian Shore: Nature and Culture in Western Thought from Ancient Times to the End of the Eighteenth Century (Berkeley, 1967), 119; Snodgrass 1987, 73; and Merle K. Langdon, A Sanctuary of Zeus on Mount Hymettos , Hesperia supp. vol. 16 (Princeton, 1976). HURWIT 61</page><page sequence="31">io i. For the problem of population increase at this time, see now Morris 1987, 99-101. It is interesting as well that Kleisthenes' reforms at the end of the sixth century aimed at artificially elim- inating the political distance between city, country, and coast, at completely integrating central asty and countryside. 102. Charles H. Kahn, The Art and Thought of Her- aclitus (Cambridge, 1979), 181-183 (LXVII). 103. This is, of course, the common explanation for the rise of pastoral poetry and landscape art in other cultures and in the Greek Hellenistic period; see Glacken 1967, 25. Also, Karl Woermann, Über den landschaftlichen Natursinn der Griechen und Römer (Munich, 1871), 65-66, and Wolfgang Heibig, "Bei- träge zur Erklärung der campanischen Wandbilder/7 RhM N.F. 24 (1869), 497-523. 104. Some of the many fountainhouses depicted in late black-figure are labeled Kallirrhoe, apparently after the spring at the Ilissos. But it is unclear whether these can actually be considered "portraits" of Kallir- rhoe (or, indeed, whether other vase-paintings actually were supposed to represent the southeast fountain- house in the Agora). See John Griffiths Pedley, "Re- flections of Architecture in Sixth-Century Attic Vase- Painting," in Papers on the Amasis Painter and His World (Malibu, 1987), 63-77. 105. On fountainhouse scenes, see Pedley 1987; also, Moon 1983, fig. 7.7a-c. 106. Although there is not much Archaic poetry that can be securely dated at the end of the period, Si- monides' poem on Danae (543 PMG) seems a poetic expression of a new interest in setting, in placing human figures in a plausible (if in this case threat- ening) relationship with nature. 107. Xenophon, Memorabilia 1.4.8. 108. For Xenophanes, the rainbow, which in the Iliad is ominous and "which men call Iris" (17, 548), is sim- ply a colored cloud; see G. S. Kirk, f. E. Raven, and M. Schofield, The Presocratic Philosophers, id ed. (Cambridge, 1983), 173, fr. 178. See also Sherman E. Lee, Chinese Landscape Painting, id ed. (New York, 1962), 3: "The preconditions for landscape [painting] include a non-anthropomorphic nature philosophy"; also W. Jaeger, The Theology of the Early Greek Phi- losophers (Oxford, 1947), 169-170, who claims that in the fifth century "nature lost its divine character." 109. See von Humboldt 1844, 84. The Classical painter Agatharchos seems to have been particularly important in the history of skenographia (see Vitru- vius VII, praef . 11), but he was not likely to have been the very first painter of stage sets. no.
