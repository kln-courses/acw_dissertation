<plain_text><page sequence="1">Four American Prophets Confront Slavery: Joseph Smith, William Miller, Ellen G. White and Mary Baker Eddy Newell G. Bringhurst Religious of the American historian People Sydney characterizes E. Ahlstrom Mormonism in his seminal along A Religious with Seventh-day History of the American People characterizes Mormonism along with Seventh-day Adventism, the Christian Scientists, Jehovah Witnesses, and Pentecostalism as "five large and easily differentiated religious movements that bear the stamp 'made in America.'"1 The leaders of each of these indigenous religions spawned in America's environment of "religious pluralism" have been compelled to confront long-festering problems of racial discrimination involving African- Americans, or what noted sociologist Gunnar Myrdal has characterized "An American Dilemma."2 At the root of this dilemma was the institution of black slavery which flourished in antebellum America - the so-called "peculiar institution" that Joseph Smith, Mormonism's first prophet, confronted, as did the founders/ prophets of two other indigenous American religions, specifically William Miller and Ellen G. White - the two major progenitors of Seventh-day Adventism; and Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of Christian Science. Beginning in the 1830s Smith, Miller, White, and Eddy, all New England natives, were each, in their own way, caught up in the increased controversy over slavery, generated in large measure by militant abolitionism which swept like wildfire through their native region and beyond. Joseph Smith, Jr., the Vermont-born founder and "prophet, seer, and revelator" of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the oldest and largest of these three indigenous religions, commented extensively on slavery. Smith, through the pages of Book of Mormon, brought forth in 1830 and considered by the church as holy scripture on a par with the Old and New Testaments, expressed views that clearly condemned human servitude. According to Latter- day Saint belief the Book of Mormon chronicles the sacred history of an ancient American civilization of Middle East Israelite origins. This work focuses on the struggles and antagonisms between two major peoples - a light-skinned group 1 Sydney Ahlstrom, A Religious History of the American People, (Doubleday: Garden City, 1975) Vol. II, 530. 2 Gunner Myrdal, An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy, (New York, 1942).</page><page sequence="2">BRINGHURST: Four American Prophets Confront Slavery 121 known as Nephites and their rivals, the Lamanites - a dark-skinned group considered ancestors of the present-day American Indians. This work written from the perspective of the Nephites proclaimed that it was "against the law of our brethren ... that there should be any slaves among them" or that "ye make slaves one of another."3 In sharp contrast to favored Old Testament Hebraic peoples whose slaveholding received divine sanction, the Book of Mormon Nephites refused to enslave the less favored dark-skinned Lamanites. "Neither do we desire to bring anyone to the yoke of bondage."4 In fact, the idolatrous Lamanites were the ones who practiced slavery and made repeated efforts to enslave the divinely-chosen, more civilized Nephites.5 Lamanite slaveholding was cited as additional proof of that people's "ferocious" and "wicked" nature.6 At the same time Nephite resistance to the aggressive warfare of these dark- skinned slaveholders was cited as a struggle for freedom from "bondage" and "slavery."7 Joseph Smith's anxieties concerning African-American slavery were more directly expressed in the Doctrine and Covenants, a second set of Latter- day Saint writings containing Smith's revelations and which, like the Book of Mormon was considered holy scripture. Particularly noteworthy was the Mormon Prophet's "Revelation and Prophecy on War" received on 25 December 1832 in the midst of, and in reaction to South Carolina Nullification Crisis. This revelation, destined to become among the best-known in Latter-day Saint annals, was strongly millennialistic and apocalyptic, predicting that numerous wars would "shortly come to pass, beginning at the rebellion of South Carolina." In time, Smith prophesied, "the Southern States shall be divided against the Northern States" and war would be spread to "all nations." More ominous, black slaves would be involved in these cataclysmic events: "And it shall come to pass, after many days, slaves shall rise up against their masters, who shall be marshaled and disciplined for war."8 Further elaborating on this revelation a month later, Smith stated "not many years shall pass away before the United States shall present a scene of bloodshed as has not a parallel in the history of our nation."9 3 Book of Mormon, Alma 27:9; Mosiah 2:13. 4 Ibid., Alma 44-2.

In this regard compare such Book of Mor- mon prohibitions with those Old Testament verses condoning the holding of slaves by God's cho- sen people and the rules governing such slaveholding. See Genesis 14:14, 24:34, 30:43; Exodus 20:17, 21:2-32; Leviticus 25:39-55; 2 Samuel 8:2, 6,14; 1 Chronicles 18:2,6,13; Proverbs 29-30.

An August 1835 statement approved by a "General Assembly" of the Church as official policy affirmed that: We believe it just to preach the gospel to the nations of the earth and warn the righteous to save themselves from the corruption of the world; but we do not believe it right to interfere with bond-servants neither preach the gospel to, nor to meddle with or influence them in the least to be dissatisfied with their situations in this life thereby jeopardizing the lives of men. Such interference we believe to be unlawful and dangerous to the peace of every government allowing human beings to be held in servitude." This declaration was initially published in the Latter Day Saints Messenger and Advocate, the Church's official newspaper. It was clearly approved by Smith and received further sanctification through its inclusion in the Doctrine and Covenants.12 Three months later, in November 1835 Smith addressed a letter "To the Elders of the Church" in which he quoted pro-slavery scripture contained in the Old Testament admonishing: "Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh, not with eye service, as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God."13 As for the Elders to whom the letter was addressed, the Mormon leader cautioned missionaries to avoid going "unto ... slaves or servants" unless granted "permission by the master."14 In April 1836, Joseph Smith reiterated support for the South's peculiar institution in a lengthy front page editorial published in the Latter Day Messenger and Advocate. In it, Smith declared, "we [Latter-day Saints] have no right to interfere with the slaves, contrary to the mind and will of their masters."15 He then went on to give scriptural legitimacy to his position, quoting from both the Old and New Testaments. In particular, the Mormon leader cited passages from Genesis sanctioning the holding of "the sons of Ham in servitude." Continuing, "and he said cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. "l6 Affirming such scriptural support Smith further 10 Doctrine and Covenants, 101:79. 11 Latter Day Saints Messenger and Advocate, August 1835. 12 Doctrine and Covenants, 134:12. It should be noted that this resolution was not a "revelation" but was part of a section entitled "A Declaration of Belief Regarding Governments and Laws in General" placed near the end of early editions of the Doctrine and Covenants. Eventually this declaration was incorporated into the main part of this works as Section 134:12. 13 Colossians 3:22. 14 Latter Day Saints Messenger and Advocate, November 1835. 15 Ibid., April 1836. 16 Genesis 9:25, 26, 27.</page><page sequence="4">BRINGHURST : Four American Prophets Confront Slavery 123 editorialized: I can say that the curse is not yet taken off the sons of Canaan, neither will it until it is affected by as great a power as caused it to come; and the people who interfere the least with the decrees and purposes of God in this matter will come under the least condemnation before him; and those who are determined to pursue a course which shows opposition and a feverish restlessness against the designs of the Lord, will learn, when perhaps it is too late for their own good, that God can do his work without the aid of those who are not dictated by his counsel.17 Joseph Smith's shift from anti-slavery position to one affirming support for the peculiar institution was due to several factors. First and foremost were conditions surrounding Latter-day Saint settlement in the slave state of Missouri during the period 1831 to 1839. Commencing with the arrival of the first Mormons in Jackson county in January 1831, Smith was commanded by revelation to gather his followers and build the Saints' "New Jerusalem" in preparation for the Millennium and Second Coming.18 The overwhelming majority of Smith's followers were from older, more settled, non-slaveholding states in the Northeast and Midwest whereas their non-Mormon Missouri neighbors were largely southern in their background, eking out a relatively primitive existence in the rough frontier environment of western Missouri. Thus Jackson county Mormon settlers, who comprised some 25 percent of the county's total population by 1833, were forced to confront conditions alien to what they were accustomed, including the institution of black slavery.19 The resulting clash of cultures as it involved slavery was most vividly illustrated in the publication of an article entitled "Free People of Color" in the July 1833 issue of the Evening and Morning Star , the official Mormon newspaper published in Independence. The article which anticipated the possible migration into Missouri of free blacks as part of the larger Mormon migration outlined the procedures necessary for free Mormon blacks to migrate into this state. The article was not written by Smith whose primary residence at the time was in Kirtland, Ohio, but instead by William Wines Phelps, the editor of the Independence-based Mormon newspaper, having been assigned this post by the Mormon leader. Phelps, moreover, wrote a companion article in which 17 Latter Day Saints Messenger and Advocate, April 1836. 18 Doctrine and Covenants, 45:74-75. 19 Stephen LeSueur, The 1838 Mormon War in Missouri (Columbia, Mo: University of Missouri Press, 1987) is the best discussion concerning the clash of cultures climaxing in armed conflict between the Latter-day Saints and the older settlers, resulting in the expulsion of all Mormons from Missouri by 1838-39. This 25% figure is based on the fact that by this date a total of 1200 Mormons had settled in Jackson County, whereas the total population for the county numbered 5,071, as of 1832. Figures compiled from Fawn M. Brodie, No Man Knows My History: A Biog- raphy of Joseph Smith, 2d ed. (New York, 1977); and S.

By June 1836 the Latter-day Saints were compelled to flee once more further north, taking up residence in the relatively unsettled counties of Caldwell and Daviess in Missouri. Among the reasons cited for the Mormons' expulsion from Clay county by local non-Mormon residents was that "they [the Latter-day Saints] are non-slaveholders, and opposed to slavery...."23 In March 1838 Joseph Smith, along with his immediate family arrived in Far West Missouri, taking up residence in that community, thereby establishing northwest Missouri as Mormonism's primary gathering place. Joseph Smith's willingness to embrace a pro-slavery position was also influenced by a second important factor, specifically the expansion of Latter- day Saint missionary activity into the slaveholding south. Prior to 1835 and adoption of the Church's "official position forbidding the preaching to slaves contrary to the wishes of their masters ... very little missionary work occurred in the South" according to scholar Heather Hardy, who has carefully traced the history of Mormon activity amongst slaveholding southerners during the antebellum period.24 In 1836 Joseph Smith, anxious to push Mormon missionary work in this region, cautioned that "it would be much better, and more prudent, not to preach at all to the slaves until after their masters are converted."25 By 1840, at least nine southern slaveholders had converted to Mormonism, owning between them some 50 black slaves.26 20 Evening and Morning Star, July 1833. 21 Newell G.

But among the known Mormon slaveholders in Missouri was Levi Taylor who along with his wife Ann owned a total of nine slaves - four males and five females. Taylor's wife Ann was the daughter of a well-known 19th Century Latter-day Saint, Abraham O. Smoot, who himself was a slave owner.29 More noteworthy is the apparent fact that Joseph Smith, himself, owned a black slave or at least utilized the domestic services of an African-American during his Missouri sojourn.30 In addition to an active Mormon presence in Missouri throughout the 1830s combined with a desire to expand missionary efforts in the slaveholding South, Joseph Smith was also influenced by a third important factor in asserting his pro-slaveiy position. This involved the Mormon leader's strong desire to disassociate himself and the Church from the fledgling but extremely unpopular abolitionist movement. Smith's April 1836 lengthy pro-slavery editorial in the Latter Day Saints Messenger and Advocate was prompted, in large measure, by the visit to Kirtland of James J. Alvord, an organizer for the American Anti- Slavery Society. Alvord reporting that "his doctrines of liberty" were received "kindly" by the Mormon-dominated community, proceeded to organize a chapter of the abolitionist society consisting of eighty-six members.31 Smith discounted the significance of this event, asserting that "very few" Latter-day Saints were involved and that Alvord had presented his arguments to "nearly naked walls." The Mormon leader went on to denounce abolitionism in general, asserting that he "did not believe that the people of the North have any more right to say that the South shall not hold slaves than the South shall say the North shall ..." adding that the cause of abolitionism was "calculated to set ... loose, upon the world a community of people who might peradventure, overrun our county and violate the most sacred principles of society, - chastity 27 Wilford Woodruff, Journal, 19 September 1836, LDS Church Historical Department. 28 Hardy, "Southern Saints and Slavery," 10. 29 Levi Taylor, Redress Petition, 3 October 1838, Daviess County, Missouri.

Helping their position, the Saints successfully dispelled non-Mormon perceptions of being abolitionist and/or opposed to black slavery - central issues in the Mormons' earlier difficulties in Jackson and Clay counties. But during this same period, overall relations between the Latter-day Saints and non-Mormon Missourians worsened to the point of armed conflict resulting from other problems. This resulted in the so- called "Mormon War" in 1838 culminating with the imprisonment of Joseph Smith himself and the complete expulsion of the Latter-day Saints from the state, even though slavery and/or abolition were minimal factors in this bloody conflict.35 Joseph Smith's position on slavery shifted, dramatically, following expulsion of the Saints from Missouri and the establishment of Nauvoo, Illinois as Mormonism's new Zion in 1839. The Mormon leader assumed an anti-slavery position somewhat reminiscent of that which he promoted prior to 1835, representing a stark reversal from his previous anti-abolitionist, pro- slavery position. In 1842, Smith through the pages of the Times and Seasons, the Church's official Nauvoo-based newspaper, which he himself edited, called for "UNIVERSAL LIBERTY" in endorsing the activities of anti-slavery advocates. The Mormon leader's statement was prompted by the recent imprisonment of three abolitionists by Missouri authorities - an act which along with other "injustices, cruelty and oppression" which made his "blood boil" causing him to declare, "when will these things cease to be and the Constitution and the Laws bear rule?"36 Specifically addressing the problem of slavery, Smith proclaimed: "Had I anything to do with the negro [sic], I would put them on a national 32 Latter Day Saints Messenger and Advocate, April 1836. 33 Ibid., April, May 1836. Among those affirming Smith's views were high church officials Oliver Cowdery and Warren Parrish. 34 Elders Journal (Kirtland, Ohio; Far West, Missouri), November 1837, July 1838. This question was initially posed in the November 1837 issue of the Journal, but not answered until July 1837 due to the fact that publication of the Journal was suspended for several months beginning in November 1837 as a result of dissension in Kirtland which caused Joseph Smith and those loyal to him to abandon the Ohio community and migrate to Missouri. 35 Bringhurst, Saints, Slaves, and Blacks, 24-25; Bush, "Mormonism's Negro Doctrine", 61; LeSueur, The 1838 Mormon War in Missouri, 60-61. 36 Times and Seasons (Nauvoo, 111.) 1 March 1842.</page><page sequence="8">BRINGHURST: Four American Prophets Confront Slavery 127 equalization."37 To LDS slaveholders living in the South, the Mormon leader advised them to bring their slaves into "a free county and set [them] ... free - Educate them and give them equal rights."38 Smith's advice appeared to be followed by those LDS slaveholders who chose to gather with their fellow Saints in Nauvoo. Emigrating Mormon slaveholders either sold their slaves or freed them prior to departing for Illinois - a state where slavery was illegal, which further influenced them.39 The absence of the peculiar institution in Nauvoo caused Smith to boast that there was not a slave "to raise his rusting fetters and chains, and exclaim, Oh liberty where are thy charms?"40 The Mormon leader's anti-slaveiy views were echoed by other Church leaders and spokesmen throughout the early 1840s. Such views received public exposure in various Latter-day Saint periodicals published in Nauvoo and elsewhere.41 In 1844, Joseph Smith vigorously promoted his anti-slavery views as proposed public policy in his short-lived campaign for President of the United States.42 As a self-styled third party candidate pitted against Democrat James K. Polk and Whig candidate, Henry Clay, Smith adopted a platform, "Views on the Government and Policies of the United States." Smith's platform, along with other proposals, called for the "break down [of] slavery" and "removal of the shackles from the poor black man" in order to ameliorate the deplorable condition in which "some two or three millions of people are held as slaves, because the spirit in them is covered with a darker skin than ours." In his program based on compensated emancipation, Smith admonished southern citizens to petition their respective state legislators to approve the necessary funding and enabling legislation. The financing needed would be obtained through the sale of public lands. Smith was confident that Southerners whom he characterized as "hospitable and noble" would eagerly embrace his program to rid the United States which he termed "so free a country ... of every vestige of slavery."43 The Mormon leader believed that his program could bring about the complete elimination of American slavery by 185o.44 Summing up his position, 37 2 January 1843, History of the Church, 5:217. 38 30 December 1842, in Joseph Smith's Journal, kept by Willard Richards.

The Mormon leader sought to reconcile differences between proponents and opponents of Manifest Destiny - the primary issue in the 1844 Presidential campaign. This issue involved debate over American westward expansion into Texas and other western territory. Slavery was central to this debate given the situation of Texas, then an independent republic, seeking immediate annexation to the United States. Texas was a region where black slavery was both legal and a flourishing institution. Foes of Manifest Destiny opposed the annexation of Texas and other western territory, fearing the expansion of the Peculiar Institution. Whereas proponents of westward expansion were either minimally concerned about such expansion or favored it. Both major political parties were deeply divided. Within the Whig Party, "Cotton Whigs" favored expansion whereas "Conscience Whigs" were in opposition. The Democrats mirrored a similar split trough the rival campaigns of John C. Calhoun and Martin Van Buren for that party's presidential nomination. Calhoun, the South's most articulate pro-slavery spokesman favored annexation, whereas former president Van Buren assumed a free-soil position in opposition to expansion. In addition, the Liberty Party ran James J. Birney, an ardent abolitionist who ran on a strong anti-annexationist platform.46 Thus, Joseph Smith through his anti-slavery, pro-annexationist platform sought national consensus. The Mormon leader announced that once he was elected president he would annex Texas and proceed to do away with slavery in the following manner: "As soon as Texas was annexed, I would liberate the slaves in two or three states, indemnifying the owners, and send the negroes black slaves through the payment of a "reasonable price" to southern slaveholders obtained from the sale of public lands has been questioned by at least one writer, who explained: "There were almost 3,000,000 slaves in 1844, with an average value of $500. Total public land sales in the 1840s averaged approximately $2,000,000 yearly, and the proposed cutbacks in congressional membership and pay (which Smith suggested as an additional source of revenue) would have produced perhaps $500,000." According to these figures, at 1840s rates it would have taken about 700 years, rather than the 5-6 years estimated by Smith to cany out his program. See: Martin B. Hickman, "Editorial Footnotes to General Smith's Views Dialogue 3 (Autumn 1968): 28. 45 Smith, Views on the Government , 8. 46 Frederick Merk, Manifest Destiny and Mission in American History (New York, 1963), 24-88; Louis Filler, The Crusade Against Slavery, 1830-1860 (New York, i960), 176-77 •</page><page sequence="10">BRINGHURST: Four American Prophets Confront Slavery 129 [sic] to Texas, from Texas to Mexico where all colors are alike."47 Throughout his short-lived presidential campaign, Smith continued to attack the Peculiar Institution, denouncing it as a "national evil" that should not be allowed to generate "fleshy capital"48 He further lamented that America was not an "asylum for the oppressed" so long as the "degraded black slave" was compelled to hold up his manacled hands and cry, "Oh liberty, where are thy charms that sages have told me were so sweet."49 But at the same time, Smith sought to disassociate himself from the objectives of the extreme abolitionists. He proclaimed that neither he nor his Latter-day Saint followers cared "nothing about" nor were "advocates of [immediate] abolition as it now exists."50 The assassination of Joseph Smith on 27 June 1844 ended the Mormon leader's presidential campaign on an sudden, tragic note. As for Smith's program calling for the abolition of slavery through compensated emancipation, and colonization abroad, the extent of its appeal to the larger American society will never be known. In certain respects, the Mormon leader's proposals were similar to, and reminiscent of earlier proposals made by Thomas Jefferson, Henry Clay, as well as the American Colonization Society.51 More evident, is that Joseph Smith through his shifting views on slavery left a mixed legacy for Mormonism, vividly reflected in the differing, often conflicting views of those individuals claiming Smith's mantle of leadership. Brigham Young, as leader of the largest group of Latter-day Saints - those Mormons who migrated west establishing their Great Basin sanctuary separate from the larger American society - embraced anti-abolitionist, pro-slavery beliefs, reminiscent of those expressed by Joseph Smith during the late 1830s. Under Young's leadership, the Utah territorial legislature in 1852 legalized black slavery - the only western territory to do so.52 Utah black slavery remained firmly entrenched until abolished by Federal statute in 1862. Also, throughout the decade of the 1850s Young and his Mormon followers excoriated those Northerners who, in increasing numbers, condemned slavery as immoral. While at the same time, Young expressed empathy for the slaveholding south, particularly after the newly-emergent northern-based Republican Party condemned slavery and polygamy as "twin relics of barbarism."53 By contrast, Joseph Smith III, son of the slain Mormon Prophet, who 47 Joseph Smith, Jr., History of the Church, 2nd ed.

Coming of age in Nauvoo, during the late 1840s and 1850s the younger Smith was strongly influenced by growing anti-slavery sentiment which manifested itself in Illinois and throughout the northern United States.54 As Smith became politically active, he "aligned himself with the Republicans because of the party's strong anti-slavery stance."55 On at least one occasion during the 1850s, Smith while serving as Nauvoo's Justice of the Peace assisted in the escape of a black slave fleeing from the South. He did this even though his actions were clearly in violation of the provisions of the recently-enacted Fugitive Slave Act of 185o.56 As for the Civil War, itself, the RLDS leader manifested ambivalent behavior. On the one hand, he endorsed the major objectives of the war, specifically to preserve the Union and especially to end the "tyrannical institution" of slavery.57 But at the same time as leader of the Reorganized Church he was appalled by the fighting and the bloodshed it engendered. Thus he advised the young men of fighting age within his church: Do not enlist. Enlisting makes your military service an individual and voluntary action, whereby you might shed blood while in the service. Wait; if drafted, the responsibility is lifted. In such case, do not hesitate to take your place in the ranks and to do your full duty as good soldiers and citizens, supporting the government to the best of your power.58 II Besides Joseph Smith, Jr., two principal leaders identified with American Adventism, namely William Miller and Ellen G. White made public their views on slavery during the antebellum period. The views of Miller and White, in turn, influenced policies involving slavery and ultimately race within American Adventism - an emerging indigenous denomination which, like Mormonism, was highly visible during the period before and after the Civil War. William Miller, like Joseph Smith, Jr. was a New England native, born on 15 February 1782 in Pittsfield, Massachusetts but lived most of his life in two villages on the borders of Vermont (Poultney) and New York (Low Hampton). Also like Smith, Miller had limited formal education initially eking out a living 54 Roger D.

In his religious beliefs, Miller was initially a deist, but by 1816 had become a Calvinist Baptist, apparently caught up in the religious fervor of the Second Great Awakening, again as was Joseph Smith. At the same time Miller undertook intense study of the Bible, drawn particularly to its apocalyptic books, especially the Book of Daniel, whereby he became convinced that advent leading to the End Times and the Second Coming of Jesus would occur in or about 1843.59 Miller began lecturing on the advent in 1831 and over the next decade he enlisted a following that at its peak included 50,000 adherents. In 1840 Miller's adventism became an organized movement thanks in large measure to the effective promotional skills of Joshua V. Himes. Also helping in the growth of adventism was the personality and demeanor of William Miller, himself, characterized by historian Paul K. Conkin as "a kind good man, pudgy and unpretentious" projecting a genuine "sincerity." At the same time Miller reflected "the resentments of small farmers in his region" while articulating "the attitudes of lowly people, those horrified by the riches and luxuries of the cities, and ... quick to condemn the apostasies of modern, fashionable churches."60 Miller was a "committed anti-slavery man" according to historian Ronald D. Graybill.61 Initially, however, Miller expressed anti-abolitionist views. In an 1834 account he denounced the abolitionists as "fire-skulled [sic], visionary, fanatical, treasonable, suicidal, demoralizing, [and] hotheaded...."62 But after 1840 the Adventist leader became more sympathetic to the anti-slavery cause, largely because his movement attracted a significant number of one- time abolitionists. Most noteworthy was Joshua V. Himes, Miller's foremost associate, who before joining the adventist cause, had worked closely with William Lloyd Garrison in the American Anti-Slavery Society.63 Although Miller, in the words of Ronald D. Graybill, "had a reputation as a reliable and practical abolitionist," there is no record of Miller's "active participation in an anti-slavery society...."64 Actually, Miller along with his followers avoided involvement in any and idi reform associations - including the abolitionists - presenting themselves as "apolitical apocalyptics" looking, instead, towards the 59 Ronald L.

Despite Miller's withdrawal, William Lloyd Garrison proclaimed the adventist leader "an outspoken friend" of the anti-slavery cause.66 By 1843 Miller as an avowed foe of slavery was "saddened and disgusted by the factional squabbles among abolitionists" lamenting that "the poor slave, has little chance to be liberated by these two parties ..." Miller found solace in his fundamental adventist beliefs looking towards the imminent coming of Jesus. He exclaimed: "God can and will release the captive. And to him alone we must look for redress."67 In a similar spirit of apocalyptic premillennialism prominent Millerite leader, Joseph Bates confessed to a southern slaveholder: "Yes ... I am an abolitionist, and have come to get your slaves, and you too ! As to getting your slaves from you, we have no such intention.... We teach that Christ is coming and we want you all saved."68 Swept up in such adventist fervor, Miller and his followers expected that 22 October 1844 would be the date that the advent would commence. However, this date came and went without anything miraculous occurring. The so-called "Great Disappointment" followed by Miller's own death, shortly thereafter, ended the Millerite phase of adventism.69 Ill Despite the "Great Disappointment" some 50,000 people still considered themselves adventists, divided by a dozen different doctrines. The largest Adventist faction came under the control of a triumvirate of three individuals: Joseph Bates, James White, and his wife Ellen G. White. Joseph Bates, a one- time abolitionist became the movement's itinerant evangelist, preaching the message of Adventism to the outside world, while James White served as Adventism's chief organizer and publisher of tracts, books, and other materials. Ellen G. White assumed the Adventists' most crucial role as the movement's "seer or prophet" who in the words of Paul Conkin, used "her visions to confirm, reinforce, [and] extend the developing doctrines of the movement."70 Her role in Adventism was comparable to that of Joseph Smith within Mormonism. 65 Jonathan M.

At age nine Ellen suffered a broken nose and other facial injuries from a heavy stone thrown by an angry classmate. This resulted in extreme physical disfigurement along with difficulty in breathing and other chronic health problems. These problems compelled Young Ellen to suspend her formal education after completing just three grades. Psychologically she became withdrawn and sensitive. She found solace in her religious faith and as an adolescent embraced adventism. Ellen was impressed by William Miller, who preached his message of adventism in nearby Portland, Maine in 1840. However, shortly thereafter, she formally joined the Methodist Church for reasons that are not clear. Although devastated by the Great Disappointment of 1844, her faith remained strong and she experienced the first of what would become hundreds of visions. She in turn, shared her revelatory messages of hope and reassurance with fellow Millerites who, like herself, had been disappointed. The young, charismatic seer thus established herself as the prophetess of a revitalized Adventist movement - a role further re-enforced by her marriage to James White in 1846.71 Ellen G. White along with her husband and other Adventist leaders developed a set of five distinctive beliefs/practices which brought cohesion to the movement. First and most important was an explanation for the Great Disappointment of 1844. What had really happened on that crucial October 22 date was an important event in heaven not visible to mortal man on earth. Jesus Christ had entered the "most holy place" of a "heavenly sanctuary" which signaled that "he would soon return to the earth." While White and other Adventists emphasized Christ's imminent return they declined to set a precise date.72 Second, Adventists adopted the concept of a Saturday Sabbath, hence the name Seventh-Day Adventist. Third, they embraced a belief in "conditional mortality" or "soul sleep." This was the idea that upon death the deceased individual's soul did not ascend to another worldbut remained dormant or asleep until the resurrection of the body. A fourth important creed, were doctrines involving hygiene and health, including bans on alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and tea. The consumption of meat was also condemned as was the eating of excessive amounts of food. A fifth crucial characteristic involved acknowledging Ellen G. White's role as prophetess of the movement.73 The Seventh-Day Adventist movement, in contrast to Millerite adventism experienced slow growth during its formative years, numbering just 3500 members when formally incorporated as a church in the early 1860s. Meanwhile Ellen White, her husband and growing family of three children moved to Battle Creek, Michigan, where the Adventist 71 The best biography on Ellen G. White is Ronald L.

It was here that John Harvey Kellogg, an innovative physician, joined the Adventists. Kellogg helped perfect a method of turning cooked grains into dry flakes, which were initially sold as an Adventist health food. To further promote health and wellness, White established in Battle Creek the Western Health Reform Institute, placing it under the direction of Kellogg.74 Meanwhile during the 1850s and early 1860s Ellen White along with other Adventists promoted their core doctrine of millenarian Adventism that is their fundamental belief that the end times were near, interpreting the growing national division over slavery and the coming of the Civil War as clear signs of the times. White, herself, was in essence "an outspoken abolitionist sympathetic to the Union cause...." in the words of her biographer, Ronald Numbers.75 By the late 1850s White was so outspoken that on at least one occasion she publicly reprimanded a pro-slavery Adventist, threatening to disfellowship him if he did not alter his views.76 White viewed the slavery issue in eschatological terms. American slavery and the complicity of other American denominations, both Catholic and Protestant "was a chief indication of a decaying world." In an 1858 essay entitled "The Sins of Babylon" contained in her major published work, Spiritual Gifts, White condemned slavery as an abomination in the eyes of God: "All heaven beholds with indignation human beings, the workmanship of God, reduced by their fellow men to the lowest depths of degradation and placed on a level with the brute creation." The Adventist Prophet then issued the following apocalyptic warning: "God will restrain His angels but little longer. His wrath bums against this nation and especially the religious bodies that have themselves engaged in [slavery].... The cries of the oppressed have reached unto heaven, and angels stand amazed at the untold, agonizing sufferings which man, formed in the image of his Maker, causes his fellow man.... God's anger will not cease until he has caused this land of light to drink the dregs of the cup of his fury, until He has rewarded unto Babylon double."77 The onset of the Civil War with all of its death and destruction, prompted White to further declare in 1862: "God is punishing this nation for the high crime of slavery. He has the destiny of the nation in his hands. He will punish the South for the sin of slavery, and the North for so long suffering its overreaching and overbearing influence."78 During the Civil War, White and her fellow Adventists were generally Radical Republicans, thus mirroring the dominant political sentiments of their Michigan-Midwest environment. But at the same time, Adventists were 74 Numbers, Prophetess of Health, 160-201. 75 Ibid., 47- 76 Butler, "Adventism and the American Experience," 183. 77 Ibid., 184. 78 Ibid.</page><page sequence="16">BRINGHURST: Four American Prophets Confront Slavery 135 pessimistic concerning America's future, viewing it in millenarian-apocalyptic terms. The course of American history up to this point was in the process of fulfilling the prophecy of the "two-horned beast" with horns like a lamb but speaking as a dragon. This prophecy was based on the Adventists' unique interpretation of the Book of Revelation 13:11-18. In essence "the lamb-like appearance of American freedom and progress was an illusion" whereas by the 1840s and throughout the 1850s, as controversy over slavery intensified, America "revealed its dragon nature." The Civil War, itself, proved that "America was failing" with the Union tearing itself to "pieces over slavery," with the South's rebellion a "sign of the times." Ultimately, American democracy would experience "a sordid death." "As a consequence of [this] American failure the end of time was imminent."79 Accordingly, Adventists refused to vote and participate in the political process affirming their belief that "the American two-horned beast would be a dragon at heart, ultimately, no matter how Adventists voted, and they refused to 'hasten or retard' the fulfillment of this prophecy." These are the words of Adventist historian Jonathan Butler.80 Adventists also refused to volunteer to fight in the Civil War. Ellen White sanctified such refusal through a prophecy proclaiming: "I was shown that God's people, who are his peculiar treasure, cannot engage in this perplexing war, for it is opposed to every principle of their faith." Adventists could not fight for two fundamental reasons: First, America "would remain a dragon" in that slavery would not be "abolished until the Second Advent." And second, because fighting in this war (and indeed, any war) would be a clear violation of two commandments; the Fourth Commandment which called for keeping the Sabbath - impossible in a fighting army environment; and the Sixth Commandment - "Thou Shalt Not Kill."81 In response to eventual implementation of the draft, Ellen White initially urged those Adventists drafted to respond through commutation - that is, by paying a substitute to serve in their place, thereby avoiding the fighting themselves. But when commutation option was eliminated through revision of the draft law in July 1864, the Seventh-Day Adventists declared their denomination a "peace church" and their members "unanimously noncombatant."82 Thus, Ellen White, in declaring Adventists disdain for slavery while refusing to fight in the Civil War, itself, adopted a position remarkably similar to that of Joseph Smith III and the Reorganized Church. At the same time, the Adventist anti-slavery position stood in sharp contrast to support for the Peculiar Institution affirmed by Brigham Young and his Great Basin Mormon followers. 79 Ibid., 180-86. 80 Ibid., 187. 81 Ibid., 188. 82 Ibid., 189.</page><page sequence="17">136 THE JOHN WHITMER HISTORICAL ASSOCATION JOURNAL IV Also expressing views on the slavery issue was Mary Baker Eddy, founder of Christian Science. Even though the Church of Christ, Scientist was not formally organized as a distinct denomination until 1879 - some fourteen years after the Civil War and the ending of African-American slavery - the attitudes articulated by Mary Baker Eddy relative to slavery prior to 1865 were important in that they influenced practices and policies developed and enforced by Eddy within that movement. Born on 16 July 1821 in Bow, New Hampshire, Mary Morse Baker was almost an exact contemporary of fellow New England-born church founder, Ellen G. White. Like White, Baker as a youth suffered from chronic health problems, specifically spinal and nervous ailments. This made it difficult for her to attend school regularly, thus adversely affecting her formal education, again mirroring the situation of Ellen White.83 Indeed, Baker, like White, would experience chronic health problems during her entire life. Baker's "whole life," in the words of historian Paul Conkin "involved a vain search for good health and thus a preoccupation with illness and wellness that helped shape her later religious beliefs."84 Baker, however, was both resourceful and talented. By age of 12 she was writing verse, something she would continue to do for the remainder of her life. Her father, Mark Baker was a reasonably prosperous farmer and a devout member of the Congregational Church which exposed Mary to a harsh Calvinist creed that she would ultimately repudiate. She was also exposed to the political views of her father and older brother, Albert, both staunch states rights Democrats. Both were prominent in state politics and, in fact, close friends with future President Franklin Pierce. Among the important political issues, on which Mark and Albert Baker expressed views were slavery and abolition, which in turn influenced young Mary as she came of age during the 1830s. "Both Mark and Albert Baker looked upon the abolitionists as disrupters of the Union," notes biographer Robert Peel.85 Albert Baker, "the major intellectual influence on Mary" served 83 Mary Eddy Baker has been the subject of numerous biographies. Among the most insightful are three recent works: Robert David Thomas, "With Bleeding Footsteps": Mary Baker Eddy's Path to Religious Leadership (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1994); Richard A. Nenneman, Persistent Pilgrim: The Life of Mary Baker Eddy (Etna, New Hampshire: Nebbadoon Press, 1997); Gillian Gill, Mary Baker Eddy (Cambridge, Mass: Perseus Books, 1998). Also important and useful is Robert Peel's massive three volume biography detailing Mary Baker Eddy's life, subtitled The Years of Discovery (1966); Years of Trial (1971) and Years of Authority (1977) all originally published by Holt, Reinhart and Winston; along with Stephen Gottschalk, The Emergence of Christian Science in American Religious Life (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1973)- 84 Conkin, American Originals, 228. 85 Peel, Mary Baker Eddy: The Years of Discovery, 61.</page><page sequence="18">BRINGHURST : Four American Prophets Confront Slavery 137 as chairman of the New Hampshire Select Committee on Slavery" a group that "adopted resolutions rebuking abolitionist propaganda and recommending that Congress should not interfere with the slave-trade between states."86 "So far as her family was concerned" Mary heard nothing but the case against the abolitionists. The Bakers regarded "slavery itself ... a lesser evil than national disunion."87 Mary, herself, was directly exposed to the South's Peculiar Institution as a result of her marriage in December 1843 to George Washington Glover and the young couple's subsequent move to Charleston, South Carolina. Glover, although a native New Englander and long-time friend of the Baker family, had moved to Charleston some four years earlier, achieving success as a builder. Shortly after their arrival, the newlyweds took up residence in Wilmington, North Carolina. Meanwhile, Glover secured a major contract to build a cathedral in Haiti and was making plans to depart for the Caribbean nation when George became gravely ill, apparently with yellow fever. He died in June 1844. They had been married just six months and Mary was pregnant with the couple's first child.88 It is unclear whether George owned African-American slaves. In her own recollections, written many years later, Mary asserted that her husband "was considered wealthy, but much of his property was in slaves, and I declined to sell them at his decease in 1844, for I could never believe that a human being was my property."89 The factual basis of this assertion is "shaky at best" according to biographer Gillian Gill. More certain is that Glover "hired slaves for his [construction] business..." also noted by Gill.90 As for house slaves, it is "unlikely" that Glover "had any" maintains another Eddy biographer Robert Peel, who suggests that Glover "being a young man of some means and ambition ... may well have had a body servant for himself and a personal maid for his wife."91 Also highly questionable is Mary Baker Eddy's claims, again made years later: "I did all I could to teach and preach abolition" while living North Carolina "although it brought protests from my dear husband," adding: "I spoke freely against slavery and wrote vigorous articles for the press in favor of freedom"92 While it is true that Mary contributed articles to at least one 86 Gill, Mary Baker Eddy, 65. 87 Peel, Mary Baker Eddy: The Years of Discovery, 61. 88 Gill, Mary Baker Eddy, 49-64. 89 Message to the First Church of Christ, Scientist, or The Mother Church, Boston, 15 June 1902 ( Prose Works, 1902, 15). 90 Gill, Mary Baker Eddy, 65. 91 Peel, Mary Baker Eddy: The Years of Discovery, 69. 92 Irving C.

Southern newspapers were definitely not publishing anti-slavery views in those days."94 In her political views, moreover, Mary Glover remained a loyal Democrat, throughout the 1840s and into the 1850s. During the 1844 presidential campaign, after returning to New Hampshire she was outspoken in her support for Tennessee slaveholder and Democratic candidate, James K. Polk, rejecting the message of abolitionist Liberty Party candidate, James Birney.95 During the Mexican-American War of 1846-48, she rejected the abolitionists once more, specifically anti-slavery advocate claims that this war for territorial expansion would further expand slavery into the far West. A strong pro-war advocate, she wrote poetry extolling the cause of war. In one verse she exclaimed : Rouse free men from the lethargy Of Peace ye long have slept Rouse if your country's honor calls To victory or death....96 In the 1852 campaign she actively supported fellow Democrat and close family friend, Franklin Pierce over Free Soil candidate John P. Hale. A year later, along with much of the country she read with interest, fellow female author Harriet Beecher Stowe's powerful abolitionist novel, Uncle Tom's Cabin but "didn't think much of it."97 However, by the eve of the American Civil War, her political allegiance had dramatically shifted causing her to cast her lot with the Republican Party. With the outbreak of war in 1861 she was an enthusiastic, vocal supporter of both Abraham Lincoln and the Union cause. Possibly influencing Mary's change of attitude was involvement in the war by two important men in her life. One was her second husband, Daniel Patterson, whom she had married in 1853. Patterson, a dentist and homeopath, was commissioned in 1862 by the Governor of New Hampshire to help Northern sympathizers in the South. Unfortunately, he was captured by Confederates and placed in a southern prison, where he remained for almost a year. Ultimately he managed to escape returning to his practice in Lynn, Massachusetts. The second was her son George Glover, whom she bore from her first marriage. In 1861 young George at the time just 15 years old, volunteered to fight in the Union army. He was wounded and after a brief 93 Peel, Mary Baker Eddy: The Years of Discovery, 69. 94 Ibid., 322, ff. 135. 95 Ibid., 71. 96 Ibid., 85. 97 Ibid., 88.</page><page sequence="20">BRINGHURST: Four American Prophets Confront Slavery 139 hospitalization reenlisted, much to the dismay of his worried mother.98 Despitesuch personal concerns, orperhaps,becauseofthem, Mary Patterson, publicly supported the war through her written poems and prose published in various periodicals. She wrote articles defending liberty and democracy while at the same time excoriating the "hydra-headed" Copperheads. In poetry she encouraged the enlistment of soldiers, extolling "sacrifice, duty, and honor." It was "better to die nobly than in shame" she declared. Fully supportive of President Lincoln, whom she affectionately labeled "our faithful Abraham," she hoped he would continue to "blend Justice with victory" in dealing with the rebellious South.99 In addition to her printed prose, Mary wrote a letter to General Benjamin Butler, early in the war, responding to the general's capture of a significant number of slaves while advancing into the Confederate South. She urged Butler to not return this black contraband to their white masters.100 This gesture clearly affirmed, at long last, Mary Patterson's unequivocal opposition to the South's Peculiar Institution. Following the Civil War, Mary Patterson's major concern was not slavery per se, finally and completely abolished through the Thirteenth Amendment. Rather, she was concerned about her failing marriage and continuing chronic health problems. Her marriage to the economically unstable and habitually unfaithful Daniel Patterson ended in 1866 although they were not formally divorced until 1873. For her health problems she sought various types of treatment including that provided by Dr. Phineas Parkhurst Quimby. She also studied with Quimby, and was greatly influenced by his ideas of mental healing. These, in turn, helped provide a foundation for her emerging Christian Science beliefs. In February 1866, she suffered extensive injuries as the result of a fall on the ice in downtown Lynn, Massachusetts. When she regained consciousness she was unable to move and seemed close to death. However just two days later, she got up unaided, appearing fully recovered. Ultimately she credited her discovery of Christian Science for her seemingly miraculous recovery.101 Over the following decade Mary Baker Eddy (in 1877 she had married for the third time, Asa Gilbert Eddy) undertook the research and writing for what would become Science and Health: A Key to the Scriptures, her most important work. Science and Health, first published in 1875, was destined to be the foundational work for Christian Science, formally organized as a denomination shortly thereafter. Science and Health became, in the words of historian Paul Conkin, "One of the most influential religious books ever written by an American" comparable to the Book of Mormon brought forth by Joseph Smith in 183o.102 98 Ibid., 143-44- 99 Ibid., 176. 100 Ibid., 144. 101 Gill, Mary Baker Eddy, 117-208. 102 Conkin, American Originals, 237.</page><page sequence="21">140 THE JOHN WHITMER HISTORICAL ASSOCATION JOURNAL Eddy, like Smith, produced a book, based on claims of divine inspiration through revelation. In this work she taught that reality was "one unified whole" which was "in all senses perfect." That reality, which she had difficulty in defining, was in essence God. But her God was not the anthropomorphic or personal image God defined in traditional Christianity. Instead she characterized God through an array of suggestive synonyms, including, Mind, Spirit, Soul, Principle, Life, Truth, and Love. She also stressed that this divine Spirit transcended gender distinctions, including in itself the best qualities associated with both masculinity and femininity.103 Eddy further asserted that each human was an individualized reflection of this divine Spirit, and at one with its essence. In their true reality each spirit or person was fully unified in substance with God, and therefore perfect. At the same time, she denied the reality of evil, defining it as an illusion of humankind's imperfect perception of reality which was rooted in "illusions of materiality." Among the unreal manifestations of such material evil were sinfulness and unrighteousness along with disease and illness. Included were the various illnesses and maladies that Eddy herself, had suffered from throughout her life. Through divine enlightenment and by utilizing techniques of self-healing alluded to in Science and Health, individuals could cure themselves of any disease while also ridding themselves of sin and disobedience.104 Also through the pages of Science and Health Eddy revealed her strong anti-slavery views, albeit seemingly belated, given the complete abolition of African-American slavery some ten years earlier. "Slavery is not the legitimate state of man. God made men free."105 "The omnipotence of divine justice" she asserted was crucial in breaking "the despotic fetters" and abolishing "the whipping post and slave market." She acknowledged that the effort to "legally abolish unpaid servitude in the United States was hard...."106 Eddy linked the now-defunct practice of black slavery to "mental slavery" which all mortal beings found themselves in. She characterized this new form of slavery as "the bondage of sickness, sin, and death." "The voice of God" demanded that "the fetters of sin, sickness, and death be stricken from the human mind and that its freedom be won, not through warfare, not with the bayonet and blood, but through Christ's divine Science." The abolition of this "mental slavery," she confessed, would be "a more difficult task" than the abolition of African-American slavery.107 103 Mary Baker Eddy, Science and Health: A Key to the Scriptures (Boston: Christian Science Publications, 1994) passim; Gill, Mary Baker Eddy, 209-33. 104 Eddy, Science and Health, passim. 105 Ibid, 227. 106 Ibid., 225-227. 107 Ibid., 225.</page><page sequence="22">BRINGHURST: Four American Prophets Confront Slavery 141 V In conclusion Mary Baker Eddy, along with Ellen G.

The way in which each of these four prophetic leaders responded and the attitudes that each developed, directly affected policies, practices, along with basic theological ideas within all three denominations, the lasting effects of which continued to be felt long after the complete abolition of slavery in 1865.</page></plain_text>
