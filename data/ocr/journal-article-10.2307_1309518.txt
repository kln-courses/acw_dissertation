<plain_text><page sequence="1">Letters STRATEGY, STRATEGEM, CARROTS, AND ARISTOTLE Paul Kramer's Opinion on the use of the word strategy (July/August 1984 BioScience 34: 405) reminded me of a discussion session, composed of several biology faculty, graduate students, and postdocs at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, that I and others convened after the appearance of Gideon Louw's letter in Science (1979 Science 203: 955) arguing points similar to Kramer's. As I recall, nothing much was decided, except that perhaps "the dictionary" simply failed to define the term in its (new) ecological mean- ing. Two months later Murtaugh's letter ap- peared in response to Louw's (1979 Science 204: 795), suggesting that the use of the word was "a necessary evil." BioScience readers may wish to refer to a recent brief reflection on these and other arguments on the use of the word strategy in ecology by Hendrickson (1980 American Zoologist 20: 597-598). Hen- drickson points to the "misuse" of the word, argues that perhaps most users mean "strate- gem" and not strategy, and, while suggesting that its 20 and more years of ecological en- trenchment require salvation of the word as a nomina conservanda, laments "the birth of this bastard in our family of words." Well before Louw et al., Ghiselin (1974, The Econ- omy of Nature and The Evolution of Sex, University of California Press, pp. 40-41) pointed out: "We must not take the term 'strategy' too literally. The only real strate- gists here are evolutionary theorists. Carrots do not ponder differential reproductive success." JAMES T. CARLTON Williams College Program Mystic Seaport, CT 06355 How is it that we can say an eye is made for seeing, a glycoside for defense, a lek for mating? Their causes are in the past, not in the future. The answer, of course, is that the environment is predictable enough that what has been selected in the past has a prospective function now. These represent strategies; their function (contribution to fitness) is in the future with respect to the time (and cost) of their develop- ment. It is obfuscatory to ignore or even deny the future use of adaptations, as physiological reductionists tend to do. An eye is made for seeing. Why an adaptation evolved is not the same as how it evolved, much less how it developed, although the three questions are interrelated. Even Aristotle, the first biologist we know, realized this, in a nonevolutionary frame- work. If one reads what he said rather than someone's paraphrasing, one realizes that his "final cause" is what a biologist calls a func- tion or a biological role. And his teleology was just the requirement of a function, something THE EDITOR'S CORNER This issue of BioScience marks a departure from tradition-our first fall book issue and two articles reprinted from a journal biologists do not often see. Three of this month's articles address the animal welfare question, a topic that has attracted growing media attention; the fourth describes the status of biological science in Cuba. All four represent the kind of diversity and dialogue that BioScience-as the only magazine for all biologists-can and should offer its readers. You are seeing this month the first of several planned changes in content and format. One thing, however, will not change: BioScience remains committed to the highest standards of scientific scholarship and communication. We will continue to publish scientific papers of broad interest to biologists, but from time to time the main articles will also cover controversies in science and science policy. We will no longer carry a Research department with condensed versions of primary papers, but new depart- ments-including one on instrumentation and computers-are coming. For BioScience to grow, it must serve its readers. And to serve you, we must hear from you. We encourage you to contribute new ideas and articles that may not fit into traditional biological journals. Let us expand the dialogue of these Letters into the rest of the magazine. ELLEN W. CHU additional to an "efficient" cause. Thus Aris- totle's teleology is the same as Pittendrigh's teleonomy, the latter term having been invent- ed because of the medieval reinterpretation of teleology into a Christian framework. Aristot- le was perhaps too much a biologist, too impressed by his own study of the develop- ment of chicks. He extended the biological notion of function too far beyond its proper domain, to stars and rivers and forces, but the banishment of functions and strategies from physics shouldn't blind us to their essential role in biology. LEIGH M. VAN VALEN Department of Biology (Whitman) University of Chicago Chicago, IL 60637 Misuse of the term strategy, as aptly indi- cated by Paul J. Kramer in Bioscience (July/ August 34: 405), is rampant in our biological literature and lectures. Although some will deny purposeful (teleological) implications in their use of the term, many authors naively demonstrate by context that their perception of strategy as a biological concept is grossly teleological. Teleological explanations of natural phe- nomena subvert a fundamental philosophical assumption of science: namely, that natural phenomena are explainable by appropriate cause-and-effect relationships. Teleological explanations reverse this logic and are there- fore unscientific. They provide unscientific philosophies, e.g., creation science, with sub- stantial misinformation and add to the confu- sion of our time. Continued use of strategy and similar teleo- logical terms and explanations in scientific literature contributes to poor scientific think- ing and misconceptions of science not only to the lay public but also to many scientists as well. Kramer has provided an excellent ser- vice by bringing this matter to our attention. Authors, editors, and lecturers take notice! CHARLES C. KING Ohio Biological Survey 980 Biological Sciences Building Ohio State University 484 West 12th Ave. Columbus, OH 43210 Dr. Kramer's Opinion on the misuse of the term strategy (and other anthropomorphic and teleological usages) was excellent. You BioScience Vol. 34 No. 10 602</page><page sequence="2">have done well to publish his editorial. Keep up the good work. Please also consider my suggestions for change. Under the heading Research, BioSci- ence has been publishing thumbnail conden- sations of good articles published elsewhere. It is suggested that the information explosion is too great for us to know what is happening. These reprints take up space in a good journal. They repeat what is published in other journals. Please consider my sincere suggestion that they are redundant. If readers want a quick review of other fields, let them examine Science 84, Scientific American, or Science News. BioScience could use the space to print short (two pages maximum) papers on vital new topics in all the fields of biology. I am thinking of a more formal paper than the Letters in Nature. You will remember that Watson and Crick published their DNA work in Nature as a Letter. BioScience could set up the requirement that every paper must have prior review by five scientists selected by the author and noted in the field. The editor of BioScience and her associate editors could examine the article and the comments of the reviewers. Perhaps five or six such short papers could be included in each issue and the time from submission to printing would be short. Any not used would be rejected within 60 days. If BioScience were recognized as a journal where the best of the best new material were published, you may be certain the readership would increase. Furthermore, the under- standing of other fields would be facilitated much more than the rehash we are presently being served. I may be different than most, but we have a broadly based biology depart- ment. Doctoral students and visiting seminar speakers give talks on genetics, physiology, ecology, medical topics, and the usual taxo- nomic fields of microbiology, botany, and zoology. Serving on doctoral committees for areas of biology and chemistry is a constant review of the newest material broadly repre- senting all biology. It galls me to read a rehash of research that I am aware of in other jour- nals. I want to read the newest findings- immediately. There is an information explo- sion, but mostly of data 18 months to two years old when it gets into print. We don't need the rehash in BioScience. I have been a long-term member of AIBS; I want to see BioScience continue to climb in quality. KARL SCHURR Department of Biological Sciences Bowling Green State University Bowling Green, OH 43403 MORE SUGGESTIONS As another long-time member I am writing in support of the suggestion offered by Profes- sor B. L. Turner (July/August 1984 BioSci- ence 34: 404). The suggested shift might also help to increase AIBS membership. JOSEPH M. WOOD Division of Biological Sciences University of Missouri Columbia, MO 65211 BioScience seems to have difficulties with the names of Canadian universities. On an earlier occasion (March 1982 BioSci- ence 32: 169), I chided the editor for failing to identify two Canadian universities in a report that should have acknowledged their reputations. In April 1984 I was delighted to read in People and Places that two Canadians had been elected fellows of the American Orni- thologists' Union. This time, BioScience at- tempted to include their institutions but man- aged to get both names wrong. Professor Fred Cooke is at Queens University in Kingston, Ontario, not "Queens College." Professor J. Bruce Falls is at the University of Toronto; there is no such place as "the University of Ontario." Perhaps you could check references to Ca- nadian biologists more carefully so that those of us who are quietly proud of Canada's achievements are not forced to shout about them. ROSEMARY J. MACKAY Department of Zoology University of Toronto Toronto M5S IA1 Ontario, Canada NEBULOUS VIRUS TAXONOMY The classification of life is a dynamic bio- logical field, and the question of what to do with viruses has given biology teachers for years the opportunity to discuss with students the difficulty of defining life. Currently, nearly all authors of general biology texts use a five- kingdom approach. In many texts, viruses are simply discussed adjacent to the taxonomy chapters. During a quick survey of 12 newer general biology texts, we noticed a trend in viral classification that has us concerned. Many of the authors discuss viruses within their treat- ment of the monerans, and about 25% of the texts even include viruses as part of the kingdom Monera. Since this kingdom is re- served for prokaryotic cells, we feel that the inclusion of viruses within the kingdom Mon- era is inconsistent. Whether viruses are considered living or not, virologists have been busy classifying them. Maramorosch (1973) has noted that viruses should be placed into a kingdom of their own, perhaps to be called Virales. Lwoff and Tournier (1971) have listed 18 viral fam- ilies, with most ending in "viridae." The authors of at least one general biology book follow this scheme (Purves and Orians 1983). If viruses are placed into a sixth kingdom to contain acellular forms such as viruses, vir- oids, satellite viruses, satellite RNA, and de- fective interfering particles, the cellular basis of life may need reconsideration. Should we consider all organisms as cellular but enlarge our concept of life to include any forms with nucleic acid? In any case, biology students deserve better than the current nebulous viral taxonomic treatment in general biology texts. JON F. PETERS RICHARD C.
