<plain_text><page sequence="1">History of Philosophy Quarterly Volume 27, Number 1, January 2010 IS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN NATURAL AND MORAL ATTRIBUTES GOOD? JONATHAN EDWARDS ON DIVINE ATTRIBUTES Sebastian Rehnman Introduction Traditional or broadly Aristotelian metaphysics grows out of the recognition that some beings do not depend on matter for their existence. From the investigation of being as being, it also maintains that every being of experience is composite, imperfect, and finite and, therefore, requires an explanation in terms of something else. Much traditional metaphysics then explains whatever exists or can exist?why there is something rather than nothing?in terms of a first cause. In explaining the dependence of material being as a whole on the first cause, metaphysics argues that the first cause cannot be composed, imperfect, and limited. At this stage, metaphysics is traditionally called natural or philosophical theology, for the absolutely independent first cause is commonly called God.1 But as arguments for why there is something rather than nothing may yield something that can be called God, what the word God means requires further lines of reasoning. The philosophi cal investigation, then, of the nature and attributes of God is the task of making explicit what is implicit in the notion of God acquired from or supposed by arguments for the existence of God. One of the major issues is how attributes may be predicated of God.2 The great philosopher-theologian Jonathan Edwards (1703-58) infers a central distinction between the natural and moral attributes of God. According to Edwards, "[T]here are two kinds of attributes in God": God's "moral attributes ... are summed up in his holiness, and his natural attributes .. . constitute the greatness of God."3 In this paper, I will analyze Edwards's distinction between natural and moral divine attributes. Since he does not argue for why God's attributes can and should be distinguished into natural and moral ones, I first try to 57</page><page sequence="2">58 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY trace the origin or sources of this distinction. I continue by unfolding the meaning of Edwards's attributive distinction in terms of derivative human attributes. But in order to have this meaning, the distinction between natural and moral divine attributes requires a basis. I then go on to show how the meaning of this attributive distinction is grounded on both causation and negation and end the paper with an evaluation. Thus, the paper attempts to promote historical understanding of philo sophical theology by proceeding from a historical issue to philosophical issues. The Origin of Edwards's Account of Divine Attributes The meaning and ground of the distinction between natural and moral attributes may be gained from its origin. Edwards claims that he adheres to a traditional or established distinction: "divines make a distinction between the natural and moral perfections of God"(RA, 255). By iden tifying whom Edwards may have referred to, we will gain knowledge of the meaning and ground of his distinction. Who, then, may have influenced him here? In the work where Edwards infers this distinction, Religious Af fections, he marks out two authors: Francesco Turrettini and Petrus van Mastricht.4 Edwards also singles these out as the best authors in a letter at this time to one of his students: "They are both excellent." Although Turrettini's Institutio theologiae elencticae is more comprehen sive, Edwards considered van Mastricht's Theoretico-practica theologia "better than ... any other Book in the world, excepting the Bible, in my opinion."5 However, although Edwards lauds van Mastricht and Turret tini, he does not follow them on the distribution of divine attributes, for they advocate a distinction in terms of "communicable attributes" and "incommunicable attributes," namely, attributes predicated positively or analogically on the one hand and attributes predicated negatively on the other hand.6 Moreover, since the distinction between incommunicable and communicable attributes is "the most frequently used model" in seventeenth-century reformed orthodoxy, whereas the distinction be tween natural and moral attributes was rarely used until the eighteenth century,7 one would expect this to be the distinction Edwards refers to. But not only does he not formulate himself according to the majority view, the distinctions between natural and moral attributes and between incommunicable and communicable attributes differ in meaning. First, the sets of the parts of the distinctions are not the same. For instance, among the natural attributes Edwards counts both the eternity and omnipotence of God, but Turrettini and van Mastricht distribute eternity to the incommunicable attributes and omnipotence to the communicable</page><page sequence="3">JONATHAN EDWARDS ON DIVINE ATTRIBUTES 59 attributes. Second, the basis of the distinctions is different. Natural and moral attributes are (as will be seen) both predicated analogically, but incommunicable attributes are predicated negatively and communicable attributes are predicated analogically. The phrase "natural attributes" can, though, be found in seventeenth century orthodoxy. However, it is then distinguished from "personal attributes" (such as "the generation of the Son").8 So, this is not the dis tinction "divines make" between natural and moral divine attributes. Perhaps we should look for the origin of Edwards's distinction among so-called Enlightenment thinkers. But John Locke does not distinguish between natural and moral divine attributes, nor can that distinc tion be inferred from his formulations.9 Nicolas Malebranche does not distinguish between sorts of divine attributes,10 whereas Henry More distinguishes between privative and positive divine attributes.11 So these appear not to be the source of Edwards's distinction. However, the distinction can be found explicitly in two eighteenth century authors Edwards appreciated. First, in Synopsis metaphysicae, Francis Hutcheson contends that the natural divine attributes are incommunicable because they can not be known by the inner awareness of human virtues and that the moral divine attributes are communicable because they can be known by the inner awareness of human virtues. But this is a conflation of the distinctions, both historically and logically. More importantly, although Hutcheson and Edwards use the same distinction, they do not mean the same thing. Edwards does not (as will be seen below) equate the natural/ moral distinction with the incommunicable/communicable distinction and does not base it on the inner awareness of human virtues. Also, Hutcheson's work was not published until 1744, so there was hardly any time for it to influence Edwards or others.12 Second, there is Samuel Clarke. He does distinguish between natural and moral divine attributes, and he uses "the moral attributes of God" in the context of inferring a distinction between natural evil and moral evil. We shall see later that Edwards bases the distinction between divine attributes on this distinction between sorts of evil. However, even if Clarke would be the source, Edwards has not simply copied his distinction, for Clarke's presentation contrasts with Edwards's in not listing identical attributes in each part of the division and in being comparatively unsystematic.13 Thus, it is not clear what Edwards meant when he wrote that the distinction between natural and moral attributes was commonly used.14 No scholarly analysis has to my knowledge been devoted to Edwards's</page><page sequence="4">60 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY understanding of divine attributes.15 It may be that Edwards systema tized hints toward such a division, but tracing the origin of the distinction is of little help in understanding its meaning and ground. For this, we have to turn to Edwards's own formulations. The Meaning of Edwards's Account of Divine Attributes Edwards develops the distinction between natural and moral attributes in the following words: [D]ivines make a distinction between the natural and moral per fections of God: by the moral perfections of God, they mean those attributes which God exercises as a moral agent, . . . such as his righteousness, truth, faithfulness, and goodness; or, in one word, his holiness. By God's natural attributes or perfections, they mean those attributes ... such as his power, his knowledge whereby he knows all things, and his being eternal, from everlasting to everlasting, his omnipresence, and his awful and terrible majesty. (RA, 255) It appears later that wisdom and immutability belong to the natural attributes.16 So, among the natural divine attributes are omnipotence, omniscience, eternity, omnipresence, and immutability; and among the moral divine attributes are righteousness, truth, faithfulness, and good ness. The meaning and ground of Edwards's distinction can be pursued further from the context in which it appears. First, the distinction is stated after Edwards's explanation of another distinction, namely, "a distinction between moral good and evil, and natural good and evil" (RA, 254).17 He notes that evil is "commonly" dis tinguished into these kinds, and his understanding seems traditional.18 The natural good of something is that which "perfects or suits [its] na ture," namely, what it is; and the natural evil of something is, according to Edwards, that which is contrary, defective, or unsuitable to its nature. But moral good and moral evil belong only to "beings who have will and choice." The moral good of a voluntary agent is the will and choice that perfects, fits, or suits its nature. The moral evil of an intelligent being is the will and choice that is contrary, defective, or unsuitable to its nature. So, "considering nature abstractly" has no "respect to a rule of duty," whereas morality has a "relation" to a "rule or measure of right and wrong" (ibid.). Second, after stating the distinction of natural and moral attributes, Edwards maintains that it is based on "a twofold image of God in man," namely, a natural image and a moral image. The natural image, or "the image of God's natural attributes," on the one hand, consists in the hu</page><page sequence="5">JONATHAN EDWARDS ON DIVINE ATTRIBUTES 61 man powers of reason and understanding. The moral image, on the other hand, consists in "holiness," namely, a holy reason and understanding (RA, 256), since the "moral excellency of an intelligent voluntary being, is more immediately seated in the heart or will of moral agents" (ibid., 255). Moreover, "[m]oral excellency is the excellency of natural excellen cies. Natural qualifications are either excellent or otherwise, according as they are joined with moral excellency or not" (ibid., 257). So, because the excellency of natural attributes are consequential on moral attributes, the natural attributes of God are "included" in his moral attributes (ibid., 258).19 The moral attributes are consequential of natural attributes in that only intelligent beings can do good or bad. Third, in this context Edwards conceives of the twofold human image or likeness in terms of derivation: Holiness in man, is but the image of God's holiness: there are not more virtues belonging to the image, than are in the original: derived holiness has not more in it, than is in that underived holiness, which is its fountain: there is not more than grace for grace, or grace in the image, answerable to grace in the original. (RA, 256) In God, all virtues are originally, and by his creating other reasonable beings, those virtues can be found in them derivatively. So by their origin, humans partake of the divine attributes or perfections. Let me summarize what we have discovered this far. In the context of inferring the distinction between the natural and moral attributes of God, Edwards uses the distinction between natural good and natu ral evil on the one hand and moral good and moral evil on the other; distinguishes between a natural image and a moral of image of God in humanity; and explains the resemblance between God and creatures with a notion of derivation. He proceeds, thus, from natural and moral being in general to human being and human attributes as derivative of divine attributes in particular. This does not, however, yield much understanding of the meaning of the distinction. Fortunately, we can turn to later works where Edwards also uses the distinction between a natural and a moral image of God in humanity.20 This is fortunate because in that context, he works out the similarity and dissimilarity between the meaning of divine moral agency and the meaning of human moral agency. First, Edwards claims that God and creatures "can properly be de nominated good" according to "circumstantial difference": I call it circumstantial, because it lies only in the difference of moral inducements they are capable of being influenced by, arising from</page><page sequence="6">62 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY the difference of circumstances. A ruler acting in that capacity only, is not capable of being influenced by a moral law, and its sanctions of threatenings and promises, rewards and punishments, as the subject is; though both may be influenced by a knowledge of moral good and evil. (FW, 165)21 The difference of circumstance is the difference of being able to be induced by a knowledge of moral good and evil. Here Edwards uses the traditional distinction between the moral object and the moral circumstances of an act.22 The object of an act is what someone is doing and concerns the nature of the act. Circumstances individuate a kind of act, and Edwards here considers the most important circumstance, namely, intention. Both God and human beings are able to act on an understanding of what is right or wrong to do and thus are moral agents. However, God and human beings are not denominated "good" in the same way or sense: the term good has meaning according to the circumstances of human capacities and divine capacities, respectively. Thus, "moral agency" does not mean the same thing with respect to human beings and God.23 Second, "God's actions ... are morally good in the highest degree," for "we must conceive of him ... in the highest degree." So, God is "in the most proper sense" said to be "a moral agent" and the "source," "foun dation and rule of all virtue and moral good." Further, "[t]he essential qualities of a moral agent are in God, in the greatest possible perfec tion" (FW, 165-66). This concept of gradual instantiation of attributes has affinities with the concept of derived or derivative attributes above, for as perfections are originally in God and derivatively in intelligent creatures, so they are in the highest degree in God and in a proportion ate degree in creatures. From these passages where Edwards discusses the distinction be tween natural and divine moral attributes, we can discover several semantical assumptions and account for the meaning of the distinction, since any account of kinds of divine attributes supposes a theory of predication; that is, what properties are ascribed to God supposes that properties can be predicated of God. Edwards's account supposes, for instance, that as intellect and will can be predicated distinctively to hu man beings, so intellect and will can be predicated distinctively to divine being; and as natural perfection and moral perfection can be predicated distinctively to human beings, so natural and moral perfection can be predicated distinctively to divine being. His reasoning that God must be conceived in the highest degree and that attributes are in God in the greatest possible perfection supposes clearly that a similarity between God and creatures can be truly predicated. God is the fountain, source, and rule of everything that exists apart from himself. Every perfection is originally in God, and there is no perfection that is not derived from</page><page sequence="7">JONATHAN EDWARDS ON DIVINE ATTRIBUTES 63 God; but perfections are in God in the highest degree or in the greatest possible perfection. For instance, everything that exists apart from God either has the power of will or lacks the power of will, and these are moral beings and natural beings, respectively. Humans are moral beings, and they display natural attributes such as power and knowledge and moral attributes such as goodness and holiness. Human attributes are, then, derivative from divine attributes; therefore, natural and moral attributes can be predicated of God. The Ground of Edwards's Account of Divine Attributes However, what attributes are said of God presupposes that attributes can be ascribed to God, and that attributes can be predicated of God presupposes why attributes can be said of God. Why, then, on Edwards's account, can predicates derived from creatures truly be said of God according to resemblance or similarity? We need to explore Edwards's ground of saying that divine natural and moral attributes are imaged by human beings. Arguments for the existence of God answer why attributes can be said of God. On the basis of such arguments, God is said to be so and so, but God is said to be so and so depending on the sort of argument as sumed for the existence of God. On the basis of a conceptual (or so-called ontological) argument, divine attributes are predicated from the idea of perfection.24 On the basis of a causal argument, divine attributes are predicated from the notion of a first cause and/or last cause. Most argu ments for the existence of God are causal arguments, and they (usually) conclude that God is self-existent and that every other existent being depends on God. Thus, on account of this minimal causal knowledge of a first self-existing cause, every other perfection is attributed to God; or (in other words), every other divine perfection is ascribed on account of divine self-existence.25 In order to understand Edwards's view of divine attributes, and in particular his ground of attributing perfections to God, we need to look at his view of arguments for the existence of God. Now, it is clear that Edwards holds to a causal argumentation for the existence of God: "all our proof of the being of God" are from "his works" (FW, 181-82).26 This gives natural theology, according to Edwards, a threefold structure: We first ascend, and prove a posteriori, or from effects, that there must be an eternal cause; and, then secondly, prove by argumentation, not intuition, that this being must be necessarily existent; and then thirdly, from the proved necessity of his existence, we may descend, and prove many of his perfections a priori. (FW, 182)</page><page sequence="8">64 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY Here Edwards adheres to the traditional pseudo-Dionysian conception of the threefold way to God.27 Knowledge of divine attributes is based on a minimal causal knowledge of God, negation, and finally eminence or analogy. In the first stage, there is an a posteriori argument, and this stage (as will be seen more clearly below) corresponds to the way of causality (via causalitatis). In the second stage, there is an argument for the necessary existence of the first cause, and this stage answers to the way of negation (via negationis or remotionis). In the last stage, there is an a priori argument, and this stage corresponds to the way of eminence (via eminentiae or analog?a). So, from this we may expect that Edwards claims that whatever perfection is ascribed to God is ascribed on account of the necessary being of God. Edwards's first stage of natural theology establishes the existence of God: "We first ascend, and prove a posteriori,... that there must be an eternal cause." It is clear that Edwards here uses the phrase "a posteri ori" not in the modern sense of "empirical" but in the traditional sense of an argument that proceeds "from effects" to a "cause."28 The structure of such an argument, Edwards states briefly in the following words: 'Tis evident that none of the creatures, none of the beings that we behold, are the first principle of their own action; but all alterations follow, in a chain, from other alterations. Now therefore, there must necessarily be something in itself active, so as that it is the very first beginning of its own action; or some necessary being, that has been the cause of all the rest: which cannot be matter, as is evident from the nature of matter. (Miscellany 134)29 So Edwards argues from changeable effects in the world to their first unchangeable cause. The first stage concludes that God is "the first ef ficient cause and ... the last final cause."30 The second stage of natural theology goes on from the first stage: the "argumentation ... that this being must be necessarily existent." Elsewhere, Edwards seems to make a principal statement about this stage: 'Tis by metaphysics only, that we can demonstrate, that God is not limited to a place, or is not mutable; that he is not ignorant, or forget ful; that it is impossible for him to lie, or be unjust; and that there is one God only, and not hundreds or thousands. (FW, 454)31 The metaphysical argumentation concerning the being and nature of God at this stage is negative, proving "that God is not limited to a place, or is not mutable." That the second stage of natural theology is a negative argument was already hinted at in the quotation at the end of the last</page><page sequence="9">JONATHAN EDWARDS ON DIVINE ATTRIBUTES 65 paragraph: "something in itself active ... , which cannot be matter."32 So the second stage proceeds from that which "in itself is active" of the first stage to denials of that which characterizes everything else. The second stage says how God does not exist by denying of the first cause what is true of its effects, and it follows on the first stage, since nothing could be denied of the first cause unless something is previously affirmed about it. The second stage is negative because, in order to account for everything that is material and mutable, matter and change must be denied of the first cause, for a material and changeable thing could not be "in itself active." God is, then, not composed, that is, simple. Simplic ity means (among other things), according to Edwards, that "all the attributes of God do as it were imply one another," since they "are no part of the excellency of God's nature" (RA, 257,258).33 For instance, the infinity and eternity of God are not "a distinct kind of good in God," but "only expresses the degree" and "the duration of good" in him. And "His immutability is still the same good, with a negation of change" (CEG, 528). The attribute of infinity follows simplicity since God is in and of himself active and perfect. This infinity as to space is immensity and as to time eternity.34 Since every change is measured by time and space and God cannot be measured by time and space, God cannot change.35 So at the second stage of natural theology, Edwards denies that God has any parts, denies that God has any limits, and denies that God can change. He thus concludes that the first cause "must be necessarily existent" because that God is and what God is cannot really be distinguished. In other words, it is the nature of God to exist. Edwards's third stage of natural theology "prove [s] many of [God's] perfections a priori." In the traditional sense, an a priori argument does not proceed from concepts or ideas but "descends" from cause to effect.36 So, at this stage, Edwards goes on from the affirmation of the first stage that there is a first cause and from the negation of the second stage that the first cause is not composed, spatial, temporal, and mutable to the effects of the first cause. Unless the first cause is known to be utterly different from every creature, it cannot be known in what ways other intelligent beings are not like the first cause and in what ways they are like the first cause. He describes this procedure in the following words: We observe that the First Cause of things that has disposed the world ... does things for final causes. ... Now, there are no beings in the universe that act in any measure so, but only those that have understanding and will, contrivance and design. These act in some imperfect manner like God, in their disposing things, in things that they make and order?and no other. (Miscellany 896)37</page><page sequence="10">66 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY Edwards here assumes the traditional doctrine that every cause imposes its nature on its effects.38 On the assumption that effects resemble the character of their cause, Edwards claims that intelligent beings "act in some imperfect manner like God." Elsewhere, he explains this in terms of analogy: "It pleases God ... to establish inferior things in an analogy to superior" (NTV, 564).39 The via eminentiae is in Edwards's tradition about analogical predication, and he is committed to this common solu tion.40 In the last section, we saw Edwards's reasoning that God must be conceived in the highest degree and that attributes are in God in the greatest possible perfection, for "we must conceive of him... in the high est degree" (FW, 166). Edwards explains this in the following words: We never could have any notion what understanding or volition, love or hatred are, either in created spirits or in God, if we had never experienced what understanding and volition, love and hatred are in our own minds. Knowing what they are by consciousness, we can add degrees, and deny limits, and remove changeableness and other imperfections, and ascribe them to God. Which is the only way we come to be capable of conceiving of anything in the Deity. (NTV, 592)41 The traditional way of eminence is precisely adding degrees and denying limits. This is possible on account of participation. For instance, human knowledge of God is, according to Edwards, participation in God's knowl edge of himself (CEG, 441). "The Almighty's knowledge is not so different from ours, but that ours is the image of [it]" (Miscellany 94).42 This may also remind us that terms such as "good," according to Edwards, stand "in the highest degree" for God as the "source, foundation and rule" and that human attributes are derivative of divine attributes. So, from the nature of the first cause, it can be argued that the effects, especially rational creatures, participate or derive their perfections from God. In this way, Edwards descends in the third stage from the nature of the first cause to its effects. In this section, we have seen that Edwards's ground for analogical predication is twofold, namely, an argument from the world as effect to a positive predication that there is a first cause and an argument from the world to negative predications that the first cause is incomposite, immeasurable, and unchangeable and, therefore, necessarily existent. The first ground of positive predication corresponds to the first stage of natural theology, and the second ground of negative predication corresponds to the second stage of natural theology. Edwards's distinc tion between kinds of attributes belongs to the third stage of natural theology, namely, that of analogical predication, for both natural and moral attributes are predicated of God from their display in creatures by analogy. Thus, Edwards's three stages of natural theology depend on</page><page sequence="11">JONATHAN EDWARDS ON DIVINE ATTRIBUTES 67 each other, and stage three in particular shows how perfections may be predicated analogically of God. Evaluation of Edwards's Account of Divine Attributes In this section, I will evaluate the consistency of Edwards's proposal. In the earlier sections, we have seen the meaning and ground of Edwards's account of divine attributes. What the distinction means is that God can be predicated natural and moral attributes by analogy of human natural and moral attributes. Analogical predication is in turn grounded in an overall argument that God, the utterly other first cause, has produced analogical effects in creatures, especially in intelligent beings. Both kinds of divine attributes belong to the third stage of natural theology; therefore, every natural and moral divine attribute is known by anal ogy of human attributes. I now turn to argue that Edwards's distinction between natural and moral divine attributes is not consistent with his overall natural theology, since the distinction means that attributes can be predicated analogically and is grounded on an account of causa tion according to which effects are like their causes, but the distinction contains attributes that cannot be predicated analogically on his own account. Thus, Edwards's account is incoherent. Recall that Edwards lists omnipotence, omniscience, eternity, omni presence, and immutability among the natural divine attributes, and righteousness, truth, faithfulness, and goodness among the moral divine attributes. So, given analogical predication, there is ground to attribute omnipotence, omniscience, righteousness, truth, faithfulness, and good ness to God. However, some of the attributes Edwards includes in the distinction cannot on his own account be predicated analogically: "'Tis as improper, to imagine that the immensity and omnipresence of God is distinguished by a series of miles and leagues, one beyond another; as that the infinite duration of God is distinguished by months and years, one after another" (FW, 386). Presumably according to Edwards, only creatures are distinguished by distances and times; God, however, is "without beginning or change,"43 and "immutability is ... a negation of change" (CEG, 528). So, Edwards's understanding of God's relation to time, space, and change can only be predicated negatively because God is utterly unlike creatures. However, when Edwards includes eternity, omnipresence, and immutability in his distinction between attributes, he is saying that God's relation to time, space, and change is similar to the creature's relation to time, space, and change and that these, therefore, can be predicated analogically.</page><page sequence="12">68 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY Thus, Edwards's distinction between natural and moral divine attributes is not a good one, for it ultimately entails a contradiction? namely, that the eternity, omnipresence, and immutability of God are attributed analogically and that the eternity, omnipresence, and immu tability of God are attributed negatively. In brief, Edwards's distinction asserts absolutely what his overall natural theology denies. So, the distinction between divine attributes and the threefold procedure of natural theology cannot both be true. This incoherence of Edwards can be explained in terms of a confu sion over the stage to which eternity, omnipresence, and immutability belongs. He seems (at least temporarily) to have overlooked that these attributes are disguised negative claims. Contrast this with how care fully Edwards determines the analogical sense of "good." He claims that goodness can only be predicated to both God and creatures by their "circumstantial difference" and, therefore, that this attribute belongs to the third stage of natural theology. However, when it comes to the relation of God and creatures to time, space, and change, the difference is essential and not circumstantial. For there is, according to Edwards, no similarity between the Creator's and the creature's relation to time, space, and change. Confusing eternity, omnipresence, and immutability with positive or analogical attributes, Edwards included them in his distinction between natural and moral attributes. Eternity, omnipres ence, and immutability attributes must, though, (logically) belong to the second stage of negative predication rather than the third stage of analogical predication. In order to attain coherence, Edwards may either deny his over all procedure of natural theology or change his distinction between divine attributes. The first way to attain coherence would be to deny the threefold procedure of natural theology. But if this procedure is denied, then analogical predication is groundless and the distinction is unjustified. So, Edwards cannot retain the distinction while deny ing the procedure; given the coherence of the threefold procedure of natural theology, he better changes the attributive distinction. Now, the second way to attain coherence would be to change the distinction. The distinction could be changed in two ways: it may either be revised or denied. If the distinction is revised, then eternity, immensity, and immutability may simply be moved from the two kinds of analogi cal attributes (natural and moral) to the kind of negative attributes. (Edwards could, of course, also revise the distinction by transferring omnipotence and omniscience to the moral attributes, but that raises another incoherence.) If the distinction is denied, then the procedure of natural theology may be retained, and another classification compatible with the procedure needs to be added.</page><page sequence="13">JONATHAN EDWARDS ON DIVINE ATTRIBUTES 69 Here it may be objected that perhaps Edwards does not suppose a theory of analogy but of univocity and does not need or even rejects the threefold procedure of natural theology.44 However, and first, even if "power" and "knowledge" have exactly the same meaning for God and creatures and the difference between God and creatures is in the end one of degree, "eternity," "omnipresence" and "immutability" cannot, according to Edwards's understanding, and probably any theory of univocity coupled with traditional theism, be predicated of creatures since change, time, and place can only be predicated of material beings. Second, Edwards adheres to an apophatic understanding of God both before and after his of use of the attributive distinction in print. For example, [n]othing is more certain [than] that there must be unmade and un limited Being. And yet the very notion of such a Being is all mystery, involving nothing but incomprehensible paradoxes and seeming inconsistencies. (Miscellany 1340)45 This obviously fits very badly with a theory of univocity at stage three. It may also be objected that perhaps Edwards conceives the second stage positively rather than negatively, since predication of necessary existence is positive, and so both stage two and stage three concern analogical predication. This will not hold for two reasons. First, the attribute of existing necessarily is only apparently positive and really a negative attribute, namely, of not being able to be caused into exist ence, for necessary existence is claimed on the basis that the first cause cannot be composed of anything, cannot be bounded by anything else, particularly not time and space, and cannot change. Second, without negative predication, there is no ground for what can be predicated analogically and what not. For instance, if the first cause is immaterial, then it cannot be truly said analogically that it bicycled through a red light or only eats strawberries in the summer. Third, the terms eternity, immensity, and immutability and their meanings are explicitly negative according to Edwards. So, Edwards takes stage two to be negative, and this is required for stage three. Lastly, it may be objected that only the moral divine attributes belong to the third stage of analogical predication, whereas the natural divine attributes belong to the second stage of negative predication. In this case, Edwards would achieve coherence. However, this objection will not hold. For among the natural divine attributes, Edwards lists power and knowledge, and these attributes are clearly predicated by analogy. It is on account of human power and knowledge as analogical effects that omnipotence and omniscience are attributed to God.</page><page sequence="14">70 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY Conclusion In this paper, I have analyzed Jonathan Edwards's distinction between divine attributes. He distinguishes between natural and moral divine attributes both by analogy of natural perfection and moral perfection and by analogy of human intellect and human will. This analogical distinction is grounded both in the affirmation of a first cause and in the negation of composition, limitation, and change to the first cause. However, Edwards does not coherently use the meaning of the attributive distinction with its ground, for he includes the negative claims of eternity, immensity, and immutability in the analogical distinction. In other words, this distinc tion assumes a much more kataphatic understanding of God than his overall apophatic natural theology allows for. So, Edwards's distinction between natural and moral attributes is a bad one.46 University ofStavanger NOTES 1.

This traditional order of procedure contrasts with much contemporary philosophy of religion. Both standard works such as Richard Swinburne, The Existence of God, 2nd ed. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2004) and textbooks such as Michael Peterson et al., Reason and Religious Belief: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion, 4th ed. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009) suppose that we first have a notion of God and then have arguments for the existence of God. This may actually sometimes be the case for some religious believers but appears to be fallacious in a philosophical doctrine of God.</page><page sequence="15">JONATHAN EDWARDS ON DIVINE ATTRIBUTES 71 3. Jonathan Edwards, Religious Affections, ed. John E. Smith, vol. 2, The Works of Jonathan Edwards (1746; New Haven: Yale University Press, 1959), 256. Subsequent references to this work will be cited in the text as "RA." 4. "The great Turretine" and "the great Mastricht," ibid., 289n4,337. Turret tini (1623-87) was first appointed professor of philosophy and then of theology at the University of Geneva, and van Mastricht (1630-1706) was professor of theology at universities in Germany and Holland. They belong, according to Richard M?ller, to the major scholars of the high orthodox era of reformed Scholasticism; Richard A. M?ller, Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics: The Rise and Development of Reformed Orthodoxy, ca. 1520 to ca. 1725,4 vols. (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2003), 3.116-17; hereafter PRRD. For the issue dealt with in this paper, see also Sebastian Rehnman, "The Doctrine of God: A Semantical Analysis," in Companion to Reformed Orthodoxy, ed. Herman Selderhuis (Leiden: Brill, forthcoming). 5. Jonathan Edwards's letter to Joseph Bellamy, 1746, quoted by Paul Ramsey "Appendix IV: Infused Virtues in Edwardsean and Calvinistic Context," in J. Edwards, The Nature of True Virtue, ed. Paul Ramsey, vol. 8, The Works of Jonathan Edwards (1765; New Haven/London: Yale University Press, 1989), 743; hereafter NTV. Edwards's writings are, according to Ramsey, "demonstra bly dependent" on Turrettini and van Mastricht (742), and he perused them probably as student but certainly as tutor at Yale (742-43n9). He had private copies by 1746 (J. Edwards, Catalogues of Books, ed. Peter J. Thuesen, vol. 26, The Works of Jonathan Edwards, [New Haven: Yale University Press, 2008], 339, 350.) 6. Francesco Turrettini, Institutio theologicae elencticae (Geneva: Samuel de Tournes, 1679-85) III.vi; Petrus van Mastricht, Theoretico-practica theologia (1699) II.iv.6, 8, II.v.7, 12. Richard M?ller claims that van Mastricht, "in the end, offers a somewhat different pattern of classification," namely, "a tripartite grouping of attributes corresponding to the questions 'Quid,9 'Quantus,' and 'Quails'?What,' 'How great,' and 'Of what sort.'" (PRRD, 2.222-23). Although van Mastricht both uses the distinction between incommunicable and communi cable attributes (II.iv.6, 8, II.v.7) and argues that that distribution "is accurate, useful and ought to be received \ferenda\" and "ought" not "to be eliminated [eliminando]" (II.v.12), M?ller interprets some formulations (probably van Mastricht, Theoretico-practica theologia II.v.9, Il.xii.l) "as part of a qualification or qualified rejection of the incommunicable/communicable distinction" (ibid., 3.222). This appears to go beyond the evidence. First, van Mastricht's qualified definition of "communicability" is commonplace and agrees with the definitions of other proponents (cf. van Mastricht, Theoretico-practica theologia II.iv.6, 8, II.v.12; Turrettini, Institutio III.vi.2-6; Thomas Ridgeley, A Body of Divinity, Wherein the Doctrines of the Christian Religion Are Explained and Defended, Complete in Two Volumes Being the Substance of Several Lectures on the As sembly's Larger Catechism, ed. John M. Wilson, rev. ed., 2 vols. (1734; New York: Robert Carter &amp; Brothers, 1855), 1.80; Thomas Boston, A? Illustration of the Doctrines of the Christian Religion, with Respect to Faith and Practice, upon the Plan of the Assembly's Shorter Catechism, Comprehending a Complete Body of</page><page sequence="16">72 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY Divinity, 2 vols, (posthumously 1773,1853) 1.79-80.). Second, the attributes of the quid and quantus sets are the same as those of the incommunicabilitas set, and the attributes of the qualis set amount to those of the communicabilitas set because both distributions of attributes are based on the communicabilitas or qualis of God's works (van Mastricht, Theoretico-practica theologia Il.xii.l; Turrettini, Institutio III.vi.2). So, since van Mastricht's distribution of attributes certainly contains a standard "qualification," it is too strong to interpret it as a "qualified rejection of the incommunicable/communicable distinction." 7. M?ller, PRRD, 3.225. M?ller claims that the distinction between com municable and incommunicable attributes was the most frequent model in high orthodoxy but not in early orthodoxy (cf. 225, 216). Turrettini maintains that "none [distinction] occurs more frequently than that by which they [the divine attributes] are distributed into communicable and incommunicable ones"; Tur rettini, Institutio III.vi.1. A search in The Digital Library of Classic Protestant Texts (March 3,2009) for "attrib.* natural.* moral.*" (thus covering both Latin and English sources published between 1500 and 1700) within a sentence resulted in twenty occurrences, of which none sets out the divine attributes in terms of the distinction between natural and moral ones. Occurrences of one part of Edwards's distinction can be found. 8. For example, van Mastricht, Theoretico-practica theologia II.v.8. 9. I take the passages of chief relevance to be Il.xvii.l and IV.x of John Locke, An Essay concerning Human Understanding, ed. Peter H. Nidditch (1689; Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1979). Edwards used it in his youthful "On Mind" (J. Edwards, Scientific and Philosophical Writings, ed. Wallace E. Anderson, vol. 6, The Works of Jonathan Edwards (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1980). Cf. Edwards, RA, 299; J. Edwards, Freedom of the Will, ed. Paul Ramsey, vol. 1, The Works of Jonathan Edwards (1754; New Haven/London: Yale University Press/Oxford University Press, 1957), 138 (hereafter, FW); and Edwards, Cata logues of Books, 338. 10. There are occasional references to divine attributes in Nicolas Mal ebranche: Recherche de la v?rit?, ed. Genevi?ve Rodis-Lewis, 6th ed., vols. 1-3, Oeuvres compl?tes de Malebranche (1712; Paris: Vrin, 1962-64), e.g., IV.i.l. Larger treatment is found in N. Malebranche, Entretiens sur la m?taphysique et sur la religion; entretiens sur la mort, ed. Andre Robinet, vols. 12-13, Oeuvres compl?tes de Malebranche (1688; Paris: Vrin, 1965), esp. dialogue VIII. For Ed wards's interest in Malebranche, see Edwards, Catalogues of Books, 142, 180, 193, 298. 11. Henry More, Enchiridion metaphysicum, 3 vols., Cantabrigiensis Opera omnia (London: Macock, 1679), 170. More's Enchiridion metaphysicum may have been part of Edwards's curriculum at Yale College, but Edwards appears not to have owned and does not ever refer to this work: Edwards, Catalogues of Books, cf. 7, 341, and 455. 12. Francis Hutcheson, Synopsis metaphysicae, ontologiam et pneumatolo giam complectens, 2nd ed. (Glasguae: Robertus &amp; Andreas Foulis, 1744), III.</page><page sequence="17">JONATHAN EDWARDS ON DIVINE ATTRIBUTES 73 ii. The distinction is, though, not found in the original edition: Metaphysicae synopsis: ontologiam et pneumatologiam complectens (Glasguae: Robertus &amp; Andreas Foulis, 1742) IILii. Paul Ramsey claims that there are only three references to Hutcheson in Edwards, that these are from around 1755 to 1757 (Nature of True Virtue, App. II 689, 692), and that the "earliest reference" in 1738 "was not to Hutcheson directly" but from George Turnbull (703-4). Peter Thuesen shows, though, that Edwards formed a desire to acquire Hutcheson sometime after May 9,1738, and had culled An Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue before 1755: Edwards, Catalogues of Books, cf. 47, 111, 211-12. However, Edwards did not own Hutcheson's textbook in metaphysics, and there is no evidence that he read it, according to the Catalogues of Books. In private correspondence, Catalog Librarian Tom Bolze (Beinecke Rare Books and Manuscript Library) writes that Yale Library only owns a copy of the first edition of Hutcheson's Metaphysicae synopsis (1742) and that "a manuscript note on the endpaper indicates that Yale acquired this copy in 1745." 13. Samuel Clarke, A Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of God: More Particularly in Answer to Mr. Hobbs, Spinoza, and Their Followers (Lon don: James Knapton, 1705) 155,236-37,245-47. On 247, "natural perfections" and "natural attributes" are used interchangeably, whereas on 242-44, "moral attributes" are used and on 237 and 241, "moral perfections" are used. The natu ral attributes would seem to be infinite knowledge and wisdom, self-existence, independence, omnipotence, eternity, infinity, and necessity. The moral attributes would seem to be infinite goodness, justice, and truth. Edwards had a private copy of Clarke's Demonstration in the 1730s but could have read it already at home as a teenager: Edwards, Catalogues of Books 325,366. For a reference, see J. Edwards, The 'Miscellanies' (Entry Nos. 1153-1360), ed. Douglas A. Sweeney, vol. 23, The Works of Jonathan Edwards (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004), 168. 14. After Edwards's death, Philo and Cleanthes used the distinction in part X of David Hume, Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, ed. J. C. A. Gaskin, Principal Writings on Religion (1779; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993) 100-1,103-4. The distinction is favored among Edwards's eighteenth-century disciples: Joseph Bellamy, True Religion Delineated, Or, Experimental Religion, as Distinguished from Formality on the One Hand, and Enthusiasm on the Other in Two Discourses, ed. Tryon Edwards, 2 vols., vol. 1, The Works of Joseph Bel lamy (1750; Boston: Doctrinal Tract and Book Society, 1853), 26; and Samuel Hopkins, The System of Doctrines, Contained in Divine Revelation, Explained and Defended, 2 vols. (Boston: Isaiah Thomas and Ebenezer T. Andrews, 1793), 1.63. One may expect that Edwards's great nineteenth-century disciple William G.T. Shedd would defend it, but he does not (Dogmatic Theology, 3 vols. [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1888-94], 1.337). However, the divine attributes are best classified into natural and moral ones according to R. L. Dabney, Syl labus and Notes of the Course of Polemical and Systematic Theology, 2nd ed. (St. Louis, MO: Presbyterian Publishing Company of St. Louis, 1878) 150. It is also defended by J. H. Thornwell, who dabbles into all the semantical and meta physical issues of the classification of attributes by reducing "the fundamental</page><page sequence="18">74 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY notion of necessary existence" to "the natural attributes" and "the fundamental notion of a Personal Spirit" to "the moral attributes": James Henley Thornwell, Theological Lectures, ed. John B. Adger, 4 vols., The Collected Writings of James Henley Thornwell (Richmond, VA: Presbyterian Committee of Publication, 1871), 1.169,168. 15. The section headed "Natural and Moral Perfections of God," in Roland Andr? Delattre, Beauty and Sensibility in the Thought of Jonathan Edwards (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1968), 122-33, overflows with quotations from and paraphrases on Edwards's RA but contains no analysis. John H. Ger stner, The Rational Biblical Theology of Jonathan Edwards, 3 vols. (Powhatan, VA: Berea Publications, 1991-93), 2.1-3, misunderstands Edwards's doctrine of divine attributes completely, for he conflates the general passage on the two kinds of attributes referred to above, with a passage in a different work where Edwards's writes of "two kinds of attributes" in the particular revelation of God in Jesus Christ. However, the latter passage may at most be interpreted as a claim about a subdivision within the moral attributes; Edwards there distrib utes the moral attributes of justice and holiness to one group, and the moral attributes of mercy and grace to another group. 16. RA, 257. Holiness is here said to qualify wisdom and immutability, and holiness, of course, sums up God's moral attributes. 17. Cf. Clarke, Demonstration, 155. The distinction has, of course, a con nection with Edwards's view of the problem of evil. On this, see Sebastian Rehnman, "An Edwardsian Theodicy," in Scholasticism Reformed: Festschrift for Willem van Asselt, ed., Willemien Otten, Marcel Sarot and Maarten Wisse (Leiden: Brill, forthcoming). 18. Cf., e.g., Augustinus, De gratia et libero arbitrio, ed. J.P. Migne, 221 vols., vol. 44, Patrologiae cursus completus, Series latina (426-27; Paris: 1844-64,), 1.1-4; Thomas Aquinas, Summa theologica, 22nd ed., 6 vols.

The "moral attributes can't be without his natural attributes; for infinite holiness supposes infinite wisdom, and an infinite capacity and greatness; and all the attributes of God do as it were imply one another" (RA, 256-57). 20. Edwards, FW, 166; Jonathan Edwards, Original Sin, ed. Clyde A. Hol brook, vol. 3, The Works of Jonathan Edwards (1758; New Haven/London: Yale University Press, 1970), 381-82; cf. also Edwards, NTV, 590. 21. In this context, there is also a definition of "moral agent": A moral agent is a being that is capable of those actions that have a moral quality, and which can properly be denominated good or evil in a moral sense, virtuous or vicious, commendable or faulty. To moral agency belongs a moral faculty, or sense of moral good and evil, or of such a thing as desert or worthiness of praise and blame, rewards and punishment; and a capacity which an agent has of being influenced in his actions by moral inducements</page><page sequence="19">JONATHAN EDWARDS ON DIVINE ATTRIBUTES 75 or motives, exhibited to the view of understanding and reason, to engage to a conduct agreeable to the moral faculty. (FW, 165) The essential qualities of a moral agent are in God, in the greatest possible perfection; such as understanding, to perceive the difference between moral good and evil; a capacity of discerning that moral worthiness and demerit, by which some things are praiseworthy, others deserving of blame and punish ment; and also a capacity of choice and choice guided by understanding, and a power of acting according to his choice or pleasure, and being capable of doing those things which are in the highest sense praiseworthy, (ibid., 166) 22. Cf., e.g., Aristotle,EthicaNicomachea (EN) lllla3-6; Aquinas, Summa theologica I?II, q. 18, art. 3,10-11, qq. 19-21; and Rudolphus Goclenius, Lexicon philosophicum (Frankfurt: Mathias Becker, 1613), 369. 23. Presumably, Edwards also assumes essential differences, since God can not do every kind of act a human being can do and vice versa. It is, for instance, impossible for an infinite, eternal, and immutable being to commit adultery and impossible for a finite, temporal, and mutable being to be at two places at the same time. 24. For example, Anselm, Proslogion, ed. F. S. Schmitt, 6 vols., vol. l,Anselmi opera omnia (1078-9; Edinburgh: Thomas Nelson, 1946-61); Ren? Descartes, Meditationes de prima philosophia, ed. Charles Adam and Paul Tannery, vol. 7, Oeuvres de Descartes (1640; Paris: Vrin, 1996), V; and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, "De summa rerum," in S?mtliche Schriften und Briefe, ed. Akademie der Wissenschaften (1676; Berlin: Akademie-Verlag, 1980), 578-83. 25. For example, Aristotle, Physica VIII.6; Anselm, Monologion, ed. F. S. Schmitt, vol. 1, Anselmi opera omnia (1075-76; Edinburgh: Thomas Nelson, 1946-61,) III; Aquinas, Summa theologica 1.44, 1.2.3, Ioannis Duns Scotus, De primo principio, trans, and ed. Allan B.

Andre Robinet, Principes de la nature et de la grace fondes en raison: Principes de la philosophie ou monadologie (1714; Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1954), 45. 26. In this context, Edwards argues that although the phrase "God is" is self-evident in itself, it is not so unto us (FW, 182). I will analyse Edwards's arguments for the existence of God elsewhere. A confused treatment is found in Gerstner, Theology of Edwards, 1.119-33, for he not only fails to understand Edwards's senses of key terms (a posteriori and a priori) and the overall struc ture of his natural theology but also misunderstands the contemporary use of philosophical terms such as "probability." 27. Edwards's reformed tradition probably inherited this structure from Aquinas's exploration of pseudo-Dionysius, Peri theion onomaton VILiii: e.g., Aquinas, Summa contra gentiles 1.14, 1.30, 3.49; Aquinas, Summa theologica 1.8.1 ad 1,1.12.12,1.13.10 ad 5,1.84.7 ad 3,1.88.2 ad 2.

Cf. the anachronistic allegation of Paul Ramsey: "So Edwards in the eighteenth century joins Barth in the twentieth in the belief that it is not God whose existence needs proof, but rather the existence of anything other than God, any world at all, that needs explaining" ("Editor's Introduction," ibid., 22). Edwards contends, of course, that it is only an argument for the existence of God that can explain that there is something rather than nothing. 32. The phrase "something in itself active" would seem to mean the same as the traditional expression actuspurus. Cf. "God is pure act..., because that which acts perfectly is all act, and nothing but act" (Miscellany 94 in Edwards, Miscellanies a-500, 260. The absolute actuality of God excludes matter or ab solute potentiality as well as time and place. 33. For problems relating to Edwards's peculiar doctrine of divine simplic ity, see Oliver D. Crisp, "Jonathan Edwards and Divine Simplicity," Religious Studies 39 (2003): 24-41. Analytical philosophers have often been confused over the traditional teaching of divine simplicity. For two clarifying studies,</page><page sequence="21">JONATHAN EDWARDS ON DIVINE ATTRIBUTES 77 see Brian Davies, "Classical Theism and the Doctrine of Divine Simplicity," in Language, Meaning and God: Essays in Honour of Herbert McCabe, ed. Brian Davies, 51-74 (London: Geoffrey Chapman, 1987), and Nicholas Wolterstorff, "Divine Simplicity," Philosophical Perspectives 5 (1991): 531-52. 34. Miscellany 194: "The infiniteness of God consists in his perfect com prehension of all things and the extendedness of his operation equally to all places" (Edwards, Miscellanies a-500,335). The "eternity of God's existence ... is nothing else but his immediate, perfect and invariable possession of the whole of his unlimited life, together and at once; vitae interminabilis, tota, simul et perfecta possessio" (Edwards, FW, 385-86). Edwards here quotes the definition of Boethius,De consolatione philosophiae, vol. 94, Corpus Christianorum, Series Latina (Turnhout: Brepols, 1957), Vvi. Edwards expresses himself similarly regarding eternity in Miscellany 1340 (Miscellanies 1153-1360, 371-72). 35. In FW, 386n2, Edwards quotes Andrew Baxter for the view that things that can change or alter are in time, but God cannot change and thus there is no succession in God. 36. Cf.

(It is incredible that Ramsey on the basis of this adds in a footnote that "actual knowledge of God is not by analogy." For more confusion on analogy, see Ramsey's n. 6 on 19.) Edwards would seem also to have the via eminentiae in mind in the following: "Man's reason was given him that he might know God and might be capable of discerning the manifestations he makes of himself in his effects and external expressions and emanations of the divine perfections" (Miscellany 1340, Edwards, Miscellanies 1153-1360, 374). 42.
