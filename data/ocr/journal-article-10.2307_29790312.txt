<plain_text><page sequence="1">CULTURAL POLITICS: RELIGIOUS ACTIVISM AND IDEOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATION AMONG 20TH CENTURY SHERPAS Sherry B. Ortner Irving Goldman is one of the great unsung heroes of contemporary anthropology. I was exceedingly fortunate to have been his colleague at Sarah Lawrence College between 1971 and 1977, and to have enjoyed in that context his generous nature and his deep affection for both the enterprise of anthropology and the people anthropologists study. Goldman was famous for his seminars, in which he led undergraduates through close readings of ethnographic texts, encouraging them to seek and find in the minutia of ethnography the meanings and values informing and shaping particular cultural traditions. (Students who have had these seminars still talk about how intellectually exciting they found them.) Goldman pursues the same strategy in his own writings. Both Ancient Polynesian Society and Mouth of Heaven involve careful rereadings of the existing ethnographic corpus, yielding fresh and powerful interpretations.1 Goldman has always claimed to eschew formal theory. I remember him saying to me at Sarah Lawrence that he told students not to read the introductions and conclusions to monographs, since what really mattered was whether or not the author succeeded in illuminating the ethnographic stuff in the middle. He took the theoretical claims of most introductions to be both overblown and counter-productive of ethnographic insight. We find the same sorts of sentiments in his own introductions: Unlike many modern field studies that exhibit the writer's methods and theoretical allegiances more than they do their subject, the Boas and Hunt ethnography is in the words and images of the Kwakiutl.2 Or: Since the time of Boas, and under the driving influence of the sociological tradition, ethnography has veered to the general, dissolving the unique qualities that are the life of a people into a standard formula that kills the culture as surely as a chemical dye kills a laboratory specimen. Yet no one can really escape theory, not even Irving Goldman. Goldman does in fact have a systematic theoretical position, but his position is such that it has made him difficult to place within the existing categories of the field. Until fairly recently (perhaps until the early eighties), there had been a split in the field at the level of underlying categories, in which people who were interested in social and cultural evolution tended to be "materialists," hostile to the notion that culture might be a force in social transformation. At the same time, people who were interested in the workings of "culture" in the social process tended to do static studies of social and cultural "integration." This set of alignments manifested itself in, among other things, the fact that it was the materialists - the so-called "political economy" school - who were the first to generate a sustained argument about the importance of historical research in anthropology (Eric Wolf, Sidney Mintz, Jane Schneider, etc.) Goldman fell precisely between the cracks of this set of categorical oppositions. He is an evolutionist but not a materialist: He is not averse to considering the role of material factors in social evolution, but he does not give them determining force. Reversing the terms but making the same point, he is a culturalist (specifically a structuralist) who is nonetheless interested in social evolution. Sherry B. Ortner is Professor of Anthropology at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Dialectical Anthropology, 14:197-211,1989. ? 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.</page><page sequence="2">198 While he is quite happy to do "integration" type studies (e.g., 1975), his primary interest is in the transformational implications of particular configurations of cultural belief and value. This project is most fully realized in Ancient Polynesian Society, where he examines the entire set of Polynesian societies as diverse evolutionary transformations upon a small set of shared, underlying principles. Specifically, he argues that the different ways in which the relationships between status and power are organized in the different Polynesian societies give rise to different internal dynamics, different developmental trajectories, and different ways of responding to external perturbations. The history of each local society is a function of these internal dynamics playing themselves out over time, in interaction with external events and phenomena. Goldman's position at first put him at odds with the materialist evolutionists, whom he criticized not so much for being materialist (again, he did not reject the role of material factors) as for being - despite their evolutionary interests - static and functionalist, and therefore for emphasizing external over internal forces for change: Social theories that assume that a stable order is inevitably established by the balance of internal forces look to external events for sources of variability. An internal order is indeed affected by direct foreign intrusion of persons, artifacts, and ideas, as well as by its more complex interplay with changing material conditions. Diffusion and ecological adaptation have been most commonly adduced in explanation of Polynesian cultural variability. Undeniably valid as such explanations are in general, they are only partial and incomplete insofar as they overlook the specifics of response of each social system and, above ail, their 4 internal characteristics of change. Yet now it seems to me that the field has caught up with Irving Goldman. Marshall Sahlins, whose Social Stratification in Polynesia was one of the works Goldman was criticizing in the above passage, ultimately criticized the cultural materialists in much the same terms that Goldman used.5 At the same time, culturalists and structuralists of various stripes have moved into historical studies in major ways. The positions taken by Geertz in Negara, Sahlins in Historical Metaphors and Mythical Realities, and myself in High Religion, are quite similar to Goldman's position in Ancient Polynesian Society? In each case there is an emphasis on the way in which internal cultural structures (of various kinds, and with various labels) constrain the way in which historical change unfolds in the societies under consideration. The present paper takes up several dimensions of the cultural (or structural) history problematic: the role of intentional campaigns to change cultural forms within the overall process of historical transformation; the relationship between changing the public cultural forms and changing the deeper structures of thought and feeling that are part of what we mean by culture; and the question of why, under some circumstances new forms and practices will simply be reinterpreted in line with deeper structural principles. I do not claim to solve all of these problems here, but I take a stab at them; I consider them all to radiate in good part from the project that I share with Irving Goldman - to understand how culture can be both deeply constraining and yet transformable through human activity and history. * * * * One of the hallmarks of contemporary anthropology is the growing concern with questions of the emergence and transformation of particular social and cultural configurations. Where for a long time such questions were specific to the so-called materialist schools of anthropology ("cultural ecology," "cultural evolutionism," anthropological archaeology in general), now they have become central across a much broader theoretical front. Two of the most significant developments in recent anthropological theory - the concern with "history," and the development of so-called "practice theory" - may be seen as particular ways of approaching these questions. One could argue over which came first - the turn toward historical understanding, or the turn to a more agentic social</page><page sequence="3">199 theory - but the two are clearly parallel and mutually supporting.7 There are of course many sorts of history, and anthropologists of various persuasions are probably, one way or the other, using all of them. The particular variety I have in mind for purposes of the present discussion is simply narrative history, the description of the flow of events as emerging from the motivated actions and interactions of particular human beings. There is a return to the particular (though not to particularism) as a way of understanding precisely those questions of emergence and transformation. The theorized, or social scientized, version of this same interest is to be seen in current theories of practice, notably in Bourdieu, de Certeau, Sahlins, and Giddens.8 Practice theories are theories of the production and transformation of the cultural order through a variety of forms of action and interaction. Normally the most significant forms of action and interaction for a practice analysis are those one would dub "political," yet in a broader sense all action is taken to have a political aspect and thus all action counts. In a practice analysis one examines the particular forms of human activity and human relationships prevalent in a society at a given moment, and attempts to see in them the sources of cultural reproduction and cultural change. Practice theories, in my view, represent enormous intellectual advances for social science understanding, insofar as they synthesize several key theoretical components, each of which had its own value, but none of which could approach explanatory adequacy on its own: historically particular narratives (of real people and real events), social and cultural theory (theories of culture and of institutions as objective phenomena in the social world), and action/interaction theory (a theory of the productive and creative potential of human activity and human interactions). With this synthesis, practice theories begin to approach an adequate understanding of human phenomena. At this point, however, there are still many bugs in the theoretical machinery. The one I wish to consider in this paper concerns the relationship between changes in social practice and changes in "culture." Leaving the term "culture" unspecified for a moment, the general issue is this: under what circumstances will transformations in practice have the capacity to revise culture, and under what circumstances will existing cultural definitions prevail such that even novel practices will be interpreted in old ways? In order to answer this question, I must first address the notion of "culture" involved, and specifically the problem of including under a single term everything from the most formal and public of "cultural performances" to the most tacit and largely inarticulable assumptions of social action and interaction. The culture that is, in Clifford Geertz's memorable phrase, "as public as marriage and as observable as agriculture," is treated as continuous and virtually isomorphic with the assumed frames of understanding and feeling that people bring to their everyday social relations.9 It would take us too far afield to review earlier notions of culture, structure, and ideology from which current theories derive. Broadly speaking, there have been two general positions: the "ideology" position (which in effect denied culture), and the "culture" or "structure" position (which in effect denied "ideology"). Anthropologists ~ generally Marxist-inspired - who talked about "ideology" emphasized ideas that were largely public (in the sense of being out in the shared social world) and political (in the sense of being linked to structures of exploitation, domination, etc.) Anthropologists who talked about "culture" in the American sense, or "structure" in the French sense, emphasized meanings that, though encoded in public symbols, were significant largely in terms of the ways in which they shaped actors' subjective dispositions; such symbols and meanings were largely not treated as political, not treated as predominantly linking up with structures of social asymmetry. Recent practice theorists, who are in general both Marxist-inspired and influenced by symbolic or structuralist perspectives, have combined these two positions, taking the culturalist view that public meetings also play a critical role in shaping "private" understandings and subjective states, but also taking the neo-Marxist view that such internalized meanings are as political as any public "ideology." Pierre Bourdieu's notion of habitus,</page><page sequence="4">200 which is deeply internalized within actors1 selves; Michel Foucault's emphasis on how discourse is inscribed on bodies and sexualities; and Raymond Williams1 concept (drawn from Gramsci) of "hegemony," which includes what Williams calls "structures of feeling," all share this theoretical move in which "ideology" (as public and politically inflected culture) has been, as it were, injected deeply into the actor, or (to put it the other way around) in which the kind of deeply injected "culture" (or "structure") of earlier schools of anthropology has been politicized.10 This move creates a range of problems. One is the problem of conceptualizing the actor as having any sort of autonomous agency. If we are to conceive of actors as almost entirely culturally constituted (and I do), how are we also to conceive of them as doing anything other than enacting pre-scripted roles? If actors1 selves have been so deeply colonized, how can they act so as to transform their world, except by accident? I have discussed this problem in other writings.11 In the present paper I wish to take up another dimension of the same general issue. I will argue that a relatively undifferentiated conception of culture, covering everything from formal public ideological formations to deeply internalized emotional patternings, creates certain reductionistic tendencies in practice theory. In particular, we potentially wind up with a new form of social reflectionism. Since self and culture are essentially continuous, then novel social practices would, in a relatively direct way, reorder both the subjectivities of actors involved in such practices and the public ideologies continuous with those subjectivities. Put in other words, we wind up with a view that what is holding the culture/structure in place is simply the social practices that embody that culture/structure; and that what will transform the culture/structure is a change in those practices. But we know this is manifestly not the case; one can think of numerous instances in which changes in practice result not in revaluation of the cultural/structural order, but in reshaping and reinterpretation of the practices themselves. In order to counter this reduction, then, it is useful to reintroduce some sort of distinction between a public symbolic order that is subject to public debate and intentional revision - which I would call "ideology" - and a more tacit order of assumptions and structures of feeling that actors bring to their social life - for which I would reserve the term "consciousness."12 The term "culture" would refer to the whole package. Obviously there are complex relations between the two orders of culture: ideology is ordered by the assumptions of consciousness and vice versa, and the distinction is difficult to make and probably harder to maintain. Nonetheless, I think we are in more trouble with the current conceptual framework, in which a relatively direct line is assumed between public ideology and the self or subjectivity of the actor. I wish to argue, further, that the public symbolic order, the order of ideology or of official symbols and official meanings, has a certain autonomy from the order of consciousness or taken-for-granted assumptions. It is this relative autonomy that accounts, in large part, for the fact that changes in social practice do not automatically result in changes of structure, because the cultural meanings and structural categories are held in place not only by the embedded habits of consciousness, but by the public symbolic order, the order of ideology. But this "holding in place," in turn, is not simply a mechanical effect; it is a function of other practices. That is, the symbolic order has a certain autonomy because its production and maintenance are to some extent the product of a separate realm of social activity which one may call cultural politics. Cultural politics are the struggles over the official symbolic representations of reality that shall prevail in a given social order at a given time. One could argue that they are the most important kinds of politics, for they seek to control the terms in which all other politics, and all other aspects of life in that society, will take place. To some extent cultural politics are empirically and, as it were, visibly autonomous: one can identify specific groups whose job it is to formulate and defend the definitions of reality prevalent at the time. In most preindustrial societies these are the religious specialists (who may or may not simply coincide with the men, and/or the elders). On the other hand, it is clear</page><page sequence="5">201 that cultural politics are an aspect of most politics, that most struggles over wealth and power are also struggles, although often inchoate ones, over the nature of reality and truth. In this paper, I will briefly illustrate some cultural politics among the Sherpas, as these emerged from a historical project I have been doing on the history of Sherpa monasticism.13 Specifically, I will take the example of an old ritual that was changed and cleaned up in a Sherpa region that had undergone significant economic change, and that was not changed and cleaned up in a region that had not undergone such change. I will try to show that behind this apparently simple case of the symbolic order responding to or "reflecting" social change (or, in modern parlance, emerging from changes in practice), there was, in the richest sense of the term, a history, a struggle between real people, some of whom won and some of whom lost. Although the points of this paper fit into a larger theoretical scheme, my aims in the present context are quite modest: to illustrate some cultural politics in which people struggle over "ideology" - public symbolic forms and public definitions of reality. At the end of these two illustrations, I will return to the question of the relationship between these struggles and certain modes of Sherpa "consciousness." Ritual Change and Non-Change in Two Sherpa Regions The Sherpas are an ethnically Tibetan people who live at high altitudes in the Himalayan mountains of northeast Nepal. They inhabit two main regions ? a higher, colder, and more northern area called Khumbu, and a lower, warmer, and more southern set of valleys called Solu. They are basically peasants, growing potatoes and grain, raising cows and yak for dairy products, engaging until recently in trade between Tibet to the north and the India-Nepal border regions to the south and east, and (from about the turn of the twentieth century) working as guides and porters for foreign-organized mountaineering and tourist expeditions. They practice the Tibetan Buddhist religion.14 When I first worked with the Sherpas, in 1966 68, I lived and worked mainly in the lower, Solu region. This region had been less involved than Khumbu in the mountaineering labor for which the Sherpas had already become famous, and was in general more "conservative" and less affected by Western contact and cash inflow. In 19671 had the opportunity to observe the very elaborate annual Dumji festival in the large and influential village of Zhung. Dumji is performed by the religious specialists, in this case the local married lamas of the village and of neighboring villages whose citizens also contributed financially to the festival. The festival is designed to rid the whole contributing and participating area of the demons and pollutions that have accumulated in the course of the year, and that bring misfortune to the people, their animals, crops, and so forth. The basic mechanism by which Dumji, like most other Sherpa rituals, brings well-being to the community is an exorcism expelling demons that have infiltrated the village and that cause trouble for people's lives. The Dumji actually contains (at least) three separate exorcistic sequences. First, the lamas present themselves in their most powerful and dangerous forms, as ngawa, or priests of the powerful spells that enable the defeat of the demons.15 In the ngawa guise they kill demons in the form of little anthropomorphic effigies called linga. Later, the lamas dance costumed as the gods themselves, and again they kill a linga. And finally there is a grand exorcism in which other receptacles for the demons are prepared and then run out of town in a giant procession in which everyone participates. Central to the success of the ritual is the lamas' abilities to harness the support of the (Buddhist) gods, in order to defeat the demons. In addition to the various enactments of exorcism just sketched - the more "religious" part of the ritual - there were also, in the Dumji festivals of Zhung and other Solu (lower valley) villages, certain acts or skits of quite a different character. In the Zhung Dumji there was a masked skit involving a couple called Gawa and Gama - Old Man and Old Woman (both figures were played by men) - who were linked by informants with ancestral beings called Pawu and Pamu. There</page><page sequence="6">202 was also a third figure, said to be their "servant." In the skit, the servant several times tried to mount Old Woman when Old Man's back was turned, and she did not seem to mind. But when Old Man turned around and saw them, he beat both of them with a stick. Eventually Old Man and Old Woman mimed intercourse together.16 This dance was preceded by several rounds of prancing about by young boys in home-made masks {tek-tek) and cardboard phalluses, making lewd pelvic gestures. The boys were said to be (among other things) the "children" of Old Man and Old Woman. The whole set of performances was taken to be hilarious by the onlookers, and indeed was quite continuous with a general aura of sexual stimulation that surrounded Dumji before, during, and after the festival. Robert Paul has argued persuasively that this version of Dumji validated and reinforced the biological and familistic aspects of human experience, and mediated the relationship between these worldly social values and the more renunciatory ideals of Buddhist ideology.17 The comic dances of sexuality and reproduction were allowed to take place (and the sexuality of the characters was allowed to succeed) within the larger Buddhist framework of divine help and protection. But all Dumjis were not the same in that era. A man from the upper valley of Khumbu was present in Zhung village during the performance described above, and he was quite disgusted with it. For one thing, he said that in his village there was none of the lewd dancing, and especially none of the childish tek-tek stuff. Further, the sponsors of the Zhung festival in that particular year (the sponsorship is compulsorily rotated) decided for the first time in remembered history not to feast the entire village, but only the lamas and other people directly involved in staging the festival. The Khumbu man was utterly scandalized by this; the idea of feasting every single person present (including even low caste Hindus, anthropologists, and tourists if they happened to be around) was intrinsic, in his view, to the proper performance of the ritual. At the time I merely noted his reactions, and took them as instances of the general pattern of Khumbu people always considering their customs superior to those of Solu. Much later, in the late seventies, I worked in the Khumbu region as well. I saw a Dumji performed in the large village of Khumjung, and indeed it was quite different with respect to precisely these points. There was no Old Man and Old Woman dance, and there were no little boys prancing about in their tek-tek masks and jerking their hips back and forth. And there were generous food distributions to everyone in attendance at the end. Historical probing reveals, however, that the missing components of the festival had been only recently present, even in Khumbu. A Western mountaineer observing the Khumjung Dumji in 1955 observed an act which seems to have involved a version of the "servant" mounting Old Woman: A half-wit... wears a pig skin over his head in imitation of the local conception of the yeti. There were howls of delight when the 'yeti* jumped on the back of a man 1ft dressed as a woman for the dance. ? And in 1957, von F?rer-Haimendorf, also observing the Khumjung Dumji, apparently observed a version of the tek-tek dancing. He remarked upon young boys "jumping about" and engaging in "a good deal of horseplay incompatible with the character of a ritual dance."19 In fact, my older informants in Khumjung in 1979 remembered doing (and enjoying) tek-tek dancing themselves. One may summarize the difference between the two Dumjis by saying that all references to the value of sex, family relations, and biological reproduction that had been present in the Dumji seen in Zhung (evidently closer to the "traditional" version) had been cut out of the Khumjung Dumji. Although the traditional Dumji exhibits some ambivalence about these features of normal social life, nonetheless Paul's argument seems correct. The overall symbolic effort at mediation seems to have been given up. How shall we understand this change?</page><page sequence="7">203 The Foundings of the Monasteries, and the Monks' Reform Campaigns Early in the twentieth century, shortly after their early involvements in mountaineering, Sherpas began to build Buddhist monasteries. Although they had always practiced a popular form of Tibetan Buddhism, with local married lamas performing local rituals for lay people, they had never had the "higher" monastic institutions.20 The monasteries, in turn, emphasized the higher Buddhist values of withdrawal from worldly concerns and concentration on seeking salvation. The primary symbol for such withdrawal is, for the monks, renunciation of marriage and family, and commitment to a vow of lifetime celibacy 21 Of course, lifetime celibacy is not preached as a general and realistic ideal for the lay people. Nonetheless, there is very clear evidence that monks embarked on an extensive (if low-key) campaign throughout the Sherpa area to devalue marriage, sex, biological reproduction, and family relations among lay people. The various facets of the monks' campaign to upgrade Sherpa popular religion will be the subject of other essays, but they may be summarized very schematically here. First, the monks disparaged the married lamas, who had previously been the highest status religious practitioners in the society. In the context of this disparagement, the monks directly focused on marriage and family as sources of sin, suffering, and distraction from the pursuit of salvation. Further, the point was made in the visual symbolism of temples and chapels throughout the villages. The Guru Rinpoche, the founder and hero of Sherpa religion, and in some sense the most famous married lama of all time, was demoted to second place in the local iconography. An informal survey of temples and chapels throughout Solu Khumbu indicates that in all religious spaces built and/or decorated before the foundings of the monasteries, the central icon was the Guru Rinpoche, flanked by his two wives. In all those built, decorated, or in some cases redecorated, after the foundings of the monasteries (including, of course, the icons within the monasteries themselves) the main figure is Ongpame (Amitabha, whom the Sherpas identify simply with Buddha), with Cherenzi, the god of compassion, on his right, and the founder Guru Rinpoche on his left. At the same time, the monks instituted two new rituals: one (Mani Rimdu) which has much the same form as Dumji (masked dancing, exorcism of evil through destruction of effigies) but which systematically represents sex and marriage as death-producing; and another (Nyungne) which extols the ascetic ideals of the monasteries directly to the lay people. I will have more to say about Nyungne later in this paper. The changes in the Khumjung Dumji festival discussed earlier were clearly derived from, and were effects of, this monastic campaign to upgrade (the Sherpas literally say "make higher") Sherpa religion. What appears to have happened in Khumbu was a successful instance of cultural politics on the part of the monks. They disparaged the lamas because the lamas were married, and because in general the lamas were too much engaged in the rounds of social life (the latter claim often symbolized by saying the lamas drank too much). The married lamas, in turn, were apparently quite demoralized by the monks' campaign. They seem to have accepted the monks' views of them as lower and less effective religious practitioners. In a few cases some of these married lamas themselves took vows of celibacy. For the most part, however, they simply failed to reproduce themselves in the next generation. Instead of teaching their sons their knowledge and skills - the normal method of recruitment of married lamas -- many of them, indeed my data indicate the majority of them, either sent their sons to the monasteries or at the very least passively allowed their sons to take monastic vows. Interviews with some of the married lamas who were directly displaced by monks in one of the old married lama temples (this is a story in itself) indicate a more or less complete acceptance of the view that celibate monasticism is superior to the religious practices of the married lamas: [He said the conversion of the temple to celibacy] was good for the temple. [He said] the married lamas said that if the temple converted to a celibate monastery, they would leave, no problem, it makes the temple</page><page sequence="8">204 more religiously/magically potent [sachermu], makes it more high [sangye temba tarup - high/holy] and so the married lamas were happy. His commitment to this view is evidenced by the fact that his son became a monk.22 In Khumbu then, there was a sharp decline in the real numbers and in the moral influence of the married lamas. Khumjung village alone - the site of the various observations of the reformed Dumji festival cited earlier - is said to have had four or five married lamas in the past, but at the time of my last observations (1979) there was only one. This one, moreover, was not recruited in the usual way (through filiation and/or training by another married lama), but was actually a fallen monk. The same pattern could be seen throughout the Khumbu region. The decline in both numbers and influence of the married lamas, in turn, meant that there were problems in staffing the rituals of the village calendar, as well as the more domestically oriented religious needs of the villagers. The villagers thus turned to the monasteries to supply monks to perform their Dumjis (among other things), and the monks agreed, but only apparently on tacit condition of being allowed to revise the rituals as they saw fit. The changes in the Dumjis in Khumjung and in other parts of Khumbu were thus direct effects of the monks taking over the performance of the festivals. The reason von F?rer Haimendorf saw an essentially unreformed Dumji in 1957 is that, as a careful reading of his book will show, the Dumji was still at that time in the hands of those four or five married lamas, whereas by the time I saw the festival in 1979, it was entirely in the hands of monks. One may summarize these points by saying that the changes in the Khumjung Dumji - in which symbols of family relations, sexuality, and reproduction were systematically cleaned out - were the result of active practice ~ the "cultural politics" of the monks who attacked the family symbolism of the unreformed Dumji, for reasons related to the ideology of monasticism. What then happened in Solu? As in Khumbu, monasteries were built and there was a monastic campaign to upgrade popular religion. Unlike Khumbu, however, the married lamas resisted the campaign. For reasons to be discussed in a moment, the Solu lamas were not so easily demoralized, and did not so easily relinquish their strong role in defining local religious values and ideals. Although the monks from nearby Chiwong monastery offered to participate in Zhung Dumji, the local lamas cited all sorts of ancient precedents and effectively kept them out.23 The contrast between Khumbu and Solu in this regard was also noted by Funke. Funke stressed the control of the local religious scene by the married lamas in Solu and emphasized the relative domination of village religion by the monks in Khumbu: "In Khumbu, the village lama is only an assistant to the monks, who are active in the village as clergy and priest."24 The non-change in the Solu Dumji was thus as much a matter of cultural politics (in this case resistance) as the change in Dumji in Khumbu. The unreformed nature of the Dumji that Robert Paul and I saw in the sixties reflected the continuing influence of the married lamas on the local ideological system. The lamas' lack of subjective domination by monastic ideology was instanced by the fact that several of them actually complained to me about the high status of the monks. Far from sending their sons into the monasteries, the lamas spontaneously raised the point that married lamas should get more merit ("virtue points" counted toward a good rebirth) and higher status than the monks, because the monks withdrew to the monasteries and tended merely to their own salvation, while they, the lamas, remained in the villages and tended to the religious needs of the people. The married lamas' continuing ability to define the terms of religious action in Solu was manifested in another piece of control they exercised over ritual form. In Solu, as in Khumbu, the monks instituted two major new rituals. One was the Mani Rimdu festival performed in the monasteries, which in effect made the same sorts of claims of achieving the same sorts of protective and purifying effects as a Dumji, but more powerfully; I cannot explore these here. The other was an observance called Nyungne, which offered lay people a powerful new way of making Buddhist merit, theoretically more powerful than anything</page><page sequence="9">205 available before. The Nyungne observances were first done in the monasteries, led by the monks, with the lay people gathering from surrounding villages. Later, the observances were moved out of the monasteries and were held in the village temples. In Khumbu, this move of Nyungne from the monasteries to the temples appears to have represented part of the general trend whereby the monks directly took over the religious services of the village temples. In Solu, however, the emphasis was different. Even though the lamas began holding the Nyungne rituals in the village temples (which illustrates that they were not entirely immune to the claims of monastic ideology), nonetheless they themselves continued to officiate at these (monastic-oriented) events. The premise of Nyungne is that the lay people become "like monks" for the period of the observance. There is extended fasting and silence, representing, though not entirely mimicking, the ascetic commitments of the monk (the latter being focused more on sex than on food). At the same time, the practitioner concentrates on achieving identification with the god Cherenzi, a god of universal mercy and compassion. In theory, by removing themselves from attachments to particular individuals (parents, wives, children) monks are able to come closer to this attitude of universal compassion; that is why they are in principle more worthy of respect and high status than married lamas.25 The Nyungne ritual carries forward the monastic theme of devaluing marriage, family, and reproduction. The myth behind the ritual concerns a king's daughter who wished to take monastic vows, and thus refused to allow herself to be married. In order to make herself undesirable to men, she prayed to Cherenzi to make her ugly with leprosy. At the outset, the story thus represents sexual desire and marriage as so abhorrent that leprosy is a preferable choice. Later in the story, the leprosy causes the princess to bleed; the monks of the monastery of which he is head think she is having a baby and throw her out. Here biological reproduction is equated with advanced leprous decay - ugly, polluting, and sliding toward death. Eventually the heroine is helped by Cherenzi, the focal god of the ritual, who sends down the Nyungne texts to teach people rites of asceticism and renunciation and thus move them closer to salvation. The observance of Nyungne is entirely voluntary (like the adoption of monastic vows). In any given year only some of the villagers will undertake the observance, together with the officiating monks or lamas. When I saw the Zhung Nyungne in 1967, only a handful of people observed the holiday. The small number was remarked on by all the villagers, who claimed that there had been more people the previous year. In addition, there was a small but significant change in the form of the ritual, which I only discovered because the Khumbu man who was scandalized by the tek-teks and the absence of food distributions at Dumji also remarked on this particular difference. On the final day of the observance, which extends over a three-day period, the entire village gathers and holds fso, a party for the gods in which food is first offered to the gods and then shared among all the humans present. According to the Khumbu man, in the Nyungne in his village temple, those individuals who had actually performed the Nyungne observance distributed coins to all the villagers who had gathered in the temple for the fso. The gesture symbolizes the achievement of universal compassion on the part of those who had observed the Nyungne. There was no such distribution of coins in the Zhung observance, however. Here, where the ritual was in the hands of the married lamas rather than the monks, the larger moral point behind the ascetic observances -- achieving and demonstrating selflessness - would seem to have been muted, if not eliminated. The first and main point to be derived from all this has already been noted: that the ritual changes in Khumbu, and the ritual conservatism in Solu, are both products of practice, of political struggles in which some people achieve moral authority at the expense of others, in which some people accept moral domination and resign the struggle, while others fight back and, at least in the short run, win. These cultural politics, or politics of the public ideology, have their own practice and their own history.</page><page sequence="10">206 But this history is not, of course, unrelated to the larger social history of the Sherpas. If one asks, as one must at this point, why the lamas folded up in Khumbu and were able to resist in Solu, the answer is itself related to the differential social (economic, political, familial) histories of the two regions, which must now be briefly examined. Social Changes in Khumbu and Solu In the time period in question - roughly since the teens of this century - Solu and Khumbu were undergoing quite different historical experiences. The differences ran through a wide range of institutions and practices; here I will focus only on differential changes in the family. In brief, Khumbu men were much more involved in high status, high paid, wage labor for Westerners (Himalayan mountaineering) than Solu men. Khumbu men's involvement in mountaineering, in turn, apparently had the effect of accentuating a trend in the area toward greater marital freedom, and lesser parental control over marriage choices, compared to Solu. It appears that there were already some differences between Khumbu and Solu marriage organization in this regard (and indeed, though space forbids going into such points in the present paper, there were doubtless many other pre? existing differences between Solu and Khumbu as well), but the wages (and the glory) from mountaineering seems to have given the young Khumbu men a certain amount of leverage against their parents in this matter. Thus, for example, von F?rer-Haimendorf points out that some young men who had been involved in expedition work were refusing to share in polyandrous marriages.26 And both Khumbu and Solu informants reported during my fieldwork in the sixties that young Khumbu people (unlike young Solu people) often had some say in their marriage arrangements. Young Solu men, on the other hand, had little involvement in mountaineering, and although they did get involved in other forms of wage labor, this appears not to have had the same emboldening effect upon them as mountaineering did for the Khumbu youth. Thus, in the same period in Solu we see a systematic pattern of maintaining - or accentuating - domestic authority relations of all sorts. Solu parents, as just noted, continued to arrange most of their children's marriages. In addition, Solu parents were said to oversee their daughters' premarital behavior more closely than Khumbu parents.27 Parent-in-law authority over sons-in-law also remained stronger in Solu, in that Solu maintained a norm (not always observed to the letter) of relatively extended groom service, while the norm for young Khumbu sons-in-law was simply to bring their in-laws gifts. Finally, greater senior (parent and parent-in-law) authority seems to be paralleled by greater husband authority: Solu women are reported to have had more tenuous rights over their own dowries than Khumbu women, and greater economic and legal difficulties in the case of divorce 28 These social differences between Khumbu and Solu are fairly clearly "reflected" in the differences in Dumji symbolism in the two areas. In Khumbu, where young people were challenging the old marriage norms, the representations of conventional marriage arrangements - "Old Man," "Old Woman," and their "children" - had been cleaned out of the rituals. In Solu, where the old marriage norms were still in force, not only was family symbolism not cleaned out of the rituals, there is an explicit representation of the triumph of established authority with respect to family norms. Thus it will be recalled that while Old Man was sexually challenged by the Servant, he successfully drove the Servant away and symbolically had intercourse with Old Woman, his wife. The discussion of cultural politics of the monks and the married lamas allows us to see how these concordances would have emerged. The discussion of the different histories of the two regions, in turn, allows us to see why the married lamas were so easily demoralized in Khumbu, the monks' attack on marriage and family joined a large social trend and fell on fertile ground. In Solu, the same attacks were discordant with the broader atmosphere; rather than the married lamas collapsing, the monks themselves were embattled. To say that there is an "autonomous" level of cultural politics is not to say that winning and losing is a matter of random chance. The differential successes of the parties is, on the</page><page sequence="11">207 contrary, deeply grounded in the larger social historical order. The notion of the "autonomy" of cultural politics refers only to the fact that human beings generate projects - like the pursuit of salvation - which take on tremendous motivating force in and of themselves. People thus struggle intensely over the symbols and practices of these projects, whether such struggle is consistent with what is going on around them or not. Monks pressed just as hard to spread the monastic hegemony in Khumbu and in Solu; in Khumbu they "won," in Solu they "lost." The intensity of their efforts was to a great degree "autonomous" of immediate conditions, but the different outcomes in the two regions was not. The Weberian Question Thus far I have been concerned to illustrate the "autonomy" of cultural (specifically ideological) politics - the fact that although cultural change may appear to follow from social change, this is not merely a mechanical ("reflection") effect, but an effect of motivated action, and in some cases of resistance and struggle. But there is a larger point to this exercise. I said earlier that "ideology" should be distinguished from "consciousness," that the public system of symbols and meanings in not necessarily continuous with the inner or subjective structures of thought and feeling that people are operating with at a given historical moment. The point seems necessary in order to counter the potential social reductionism of practice theories, whereby changes in the fundamental ordering assumptions of culture will supposedly follow relatively automatically from significant changes of social practice. I seek to complexify the practice perspective (with which I am fundamentally in agreement) by stressing that those fundamental assumptions - which I have been calling "consciousness" - are held in place not only by the social practices in which they are implicated, but the ideological formations of the culture. Yet, the struggles over ideology are ultimately struggles over consciousness, attempts to change (or maintain) the hearts and minds of the people. Buddhist theory is very clear about the relationship between symbolic form (ritual and meditational practices), on the one hand, and forms of consciousness of the other. The individual who disciplines himself (occasionally herself) fully in the enactment of a particular practice will achieve a particular state of mind and a particular form of consciousness, immediately and, with extensive repetitions, permanently. One may analytically separate ideology from consciousness, but the point of ideological politics is the maintenance or transformation of consciousness. As the final question for this paper, then, one must send the question in the other direction: If, as I have argued, changes of consciousness cannot be derived directly from social change, can it be claimed in turn that ideological change will reshape the operating consciousness of social actors? Here I take a fundamentally Western (and Geertzian) position: On the one hand, changes in ordinary practice - as I have stressed throughout this paper cannot in themselves produce changes in consciousness, since consciousness is in part shaped and directed by the ideological system. On the other hand, ideological change (in the classic instance, the emergence of the Protestant ethic) cannot in itself produce change of consciousness (the "spirit," as Weber called it, of capitalism); it must operate in conjunction with changes in social practice.29 The answer to the question of whether ideological change can transform consciousness is thus yes and no.30 Let me sketch very briefly how this argument would apply to the Sherpa material under consideration. The Sherpas have for some time been the subject of debate over their fundamental ethos (or "consciousness"). Some ethnographers have characterized them as highly cooperative among themselves,31 while others have characterized them as highly atomized and lacking strong patterns of social cooperation.32 After working in both regions, I have concluded that the differences are largely regional: there is more cooperation, both organized and informal, in Khumbu than in Solu. These differences are of course only relative: There is plenty of selfishness, non-cooperation, and conflict in Khumbu, and there is much cooperation to be observed in Solu. Nonetheless, the differences seem to be real.</page><page sequence="12">208 In relation to Buddhist ideology, in turn, it is clear that Khumbu's greater cooperativeness fits better with the (Mahayana) Buddhist emphasis on universal compassion, as stressed by the monasteries. Let us not argue over the arrows of causation. It is not my purpose to claim that Khumbu was rendered compassionate and cooperative by the presence of the monasteries and the purveyance of monastic ideology. The relatively greater cooperativeness of Khumbu very likely predates the foundings of the monasteries and indeed forms part of the context of receptivity for those foundings. Further, the relatively greater cooperativeness of Khumbu may well underlie not only their receptivity to the monastery foundings but their success in Western forms of labor as well.33 I only wish to suggest that monastic ideology and the local ethos or consciousness were mutually supportive, and that this surely played a role in the success of monastic ideology in the Khumbu region. One of the best pieces of evidence for this success is precisely the "conversion" of the married lamas in Khumbu to monastic ideology, even though this conversion meant acknowledging their own status inferiority. Solu got monasteries and monastic ideology, as well. And apparently, in the early years of the monastic movement, the monasteries were filled with enthusiastic monks and novices just as those in Khumbu were. The Mani Rimdu festivals were started, and the Nyungne observances were instituted. Yet it is clear from the discussions of this paper that monastic ideology did not move into a dominant role in the region. Between the conservative family practices in secular society, and the strong ideological maintenance work of the married lamas (and the mutual support of those two factors), the patterns of local familism and lack of wider cooperativeness remained well supported. Or, to combine the factors differently (but make the same point): Between the conservative social practices34 on the one hand, and the persistence of an atomistic and uncooperative ethos/consciousness on the other, the married lama ideology was well supported and the married lamas were able to prevail in their cultural politics. Thus, instead of being dominated by monastic ideology, the married lamas imposed their views on its forms. They maintained the Dumji in its unreformed state. They got away with complaining that the monks' higher status was unjustified. They even restructured the key monastic ritual of Nyungne in a way that removed part of its monastic message. At this point then, the model has come full circle. I distinguished ideology from consciousness, and argued that changes in ordinary practice are not enough to reshape consciousness, which is only partly shaped by practice, and which is also shaped by ideology. I argued further that ideology the, as it were, official symbol and meaning system is formulated, defended, and changed through a politics of its own. It is such cultural politics that I sought most fully to illustrate in this paper. I then turned the question around and asked, in Weberian fashion, whether the outcomes of such struggles over ideology could themselves be taken to shape popular consciousness. The answer was that the connection is no more direct going in this direction than in the other: changes in ideology could no more singlehandedly transform consciousness (in most cases) than changes in practice could singlehandedly change consciousness. Changes in consciousness must in part be based on changes in the practices in which they are implicated. At the same time, the symbols and meanings of "ideology" play a powerful role in selecting, shaping, guiding, etc., the variety of idiosyncratic interpretations and understandings that emerge from ordinary life. Hence the necessity for struggles over "ideology," for what has here been called "cultural politics."</page><page sequence="13">209 NOTES 1.

Although there are groups ethnically similar to the Sherpas all across Nepal's northern border, none of them had monasteries either, nor did they start building any until very recently. The Sherpas* move into a major investment in monastic Buddhism is thus a remarkable historical process (Ortner, High Religion; see also Ortner, "The Founding of the First Sherpa Nunnery, and the Problem of 'Women' as an Analytic Category," in Feminist Re-Visions: What has been and might be, ed.

The story of conversion of the non-celibate Thami temple to celibacy is told in full in Ortner, High Religion. 23. Actually, the monks themselves did not make the offer. Rather the founding sponsor of the monastery, who was himself a native son of Zhung village, offered to have "his" monks do the Dumji. Part of the resistance to the Chiwong monks' entry into the festival stemmed from resistance to having this wealthy and strong-willed individual exert his influence in the village. That, too, is another story. 24. Funke, Religi?ses, translation ms., p. 5. Funke's book is marred by numerous exaggerations and inaccuracies. Among other things, he overstates the marginality of the monastic system among the Sherpas, and he overemphasizes the Tibetan origins and Tibetan domination of that system. In this context, he goes so far as to call Khumbu "a religiously barbarized outer region of Tibet" (translation ms., p. 6). Nonetheless, his point about the roles of the married lamas in the two regions seems to be accurate. 25.

It should be noted, however, that the relatively less cooperative pattern in Solu appears to be more the norm within the greater Tibetan cultural tradition, as this description of a pre-Chinese Tibetan village suggests: One of the most characteristic features of Tibetan village life was that there was little cooperation within a village and almost none between villages .... There was hardly any community spirit. Although tre~ba [wealthier, tax-paying serfs, who were the dominant group in the village in question] were administratively lumped together, there was little or no positive sentiment concerning such things as improving the village. The families comprising a village were very individualistic and were primarily oriented toward betterment of their own familial unit vis-a-vis the others in the village. (Melvyn Goldstein, An Anthropological Study of the Tibetan Political System [Ph.D. dissertation, Department of Anthropology, University of Washington, 1983], 134.)
