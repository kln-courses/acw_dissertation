<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTICLES APPLIED METAPHYSICS: TRUTH AND PASSING TIME * ROBERT S. BRUMBAUGH I our first reaction to my phrase "applied metaphysics" is likely to be the same as Glaucon's when, in Rep. vii, Socrates mentions "solid geometry": "But, Socrates, this science hasn't been invented yet!" I agree; and my present discussion is an argument in favor of its invention. Ideas, such as the idea of applying knowledge of principles to practical situations, have peculiar adventures in his tory. They have to wait offstage until they are discovered, that is, an entrance cue; and the importance of the onstage role has nothing to do with the length of the pre-entrance wait. For ex ample, the industrial revolution could have occurred in second cen tury A. D. Alexandria. There was complex gearing, there were treatises on mechanical advantage via wheel and lever, there was steampower, smiths could make sound boilers. It is all well, and partly true, to say that slavery was responsible for the absence of any impetus toward a modern industrial use of invention; but the more important fact is, that the idea of applied science had not yet been discovered and institutionalized in the West. The great designers spent their time working out plans for an automatic puppet theatre and self-propelled windup toys. Just as there was no such idea of applied science then, it seems to me that we have no idea of applied metaphysics today. There is no doubt?as sporadic adventures have shown?that philosophic principles as abstruse as Hegelian dialectic can have tremendous practical impact and power. But the translation from principle to practice is un systematic, a diffusion by accident; there is no disciplined attention to the sort of application which leads from pure science to practical invention. Whitehead's brilliant analysis of the problems of the modern world concluded, you will recall, that our century is one in which * The Presidential Address, delivered at the seventeenth annual meeting of the Metaphysical Society of America, Boston College, March 18, 1966.</page><page sequence="2">648 ROBERT S. BRUMBAUGH progress and welfare require?and require to an unprecedented degree?redesign of our basic inherited "common sense" concep tions. We are trapped and hindered in our thought and planning by unrealistic and outmoded notions: of location, of duration, of education, of social progress, of beauty, of religion. I am con vinced that he was right; but how many of us have thought about the implications of his criticism of simple location toward, for instance, the designs and types of map that we use in textbooks for our elementary schools? We have not seen the need for sus tained attention to this sort of problem. One sign that the idea of applied philosophy is still un appreciated and not realized is to be found simply by looking at a Sunday paper. The New York Times has experts and editors for Religion, Sports, Science, Education, Fashion, and Law?but it has no Philosophy editor, and most rarely does a reporter see anything of public interest to be said about the meetings, lives, and opinions of eminent philosophers. Governments and corporations are not advertising for consulting metaphysicians in the press, though if they only knew it, they desperately need them. There are two reasons for our failure to develop and explain the applications of metaphysics. The first is our conviction that our proper job is to get principles clear; the translations and middle terms needed to make those principles effective are left to shift for themselves. The second reason is, that we have an unrealistic idea of what application should do. We have the illusion sometimes? at least some of us have had it?that since we see general principles more clearly than unthoughtful experts in the practical, we are also better at their own work than they. This is the wrong notion of "application." Principles, as I will show, do not lead deductively to specific and unique practical actions, but to the discovery of new limits, new directions, and new programs of exploration. I As an example of applied metaphysics, I will, for the remainder of my discussion, focus on the twentieth-century discovery that time is not like space, but a passage and transformation between modally distinct past and future. This is a good case study for</page><page sequence="3">APPLIED METAPHYSICS: TRUTH AND PASSING TIME 649 my purposes for two reasons. First, because the practical rel evance of the idea is fairly evident: I will indicate this for religion, logic, psychology, and education. Second, because the idea has been common currency among philosophers since the turn of the century, and the failure to apply it illustrates exactly what I have in mind when I say that we have not yet really discovered the idea of metaphysics in application. My main attention will not be to the technical aspect of the concept of passage, but rather to the middle terms which can act catalytically to show the implications of the idea for problems and procedures in other areas of specialization than our own. We will start by accepting the insight that time involves a change of modalities as it passes. This means that there is a genuine ontological difference in the kind and the definiteness of being which past facts, present options, and future possibilities possess. Part of this difference can be summarized by the assertion that there are no past possibilities, and there are no future facts. It follows that we have created an unreal problem in our uncriticized assumption that the concepts of causation, truth, law, and deter minism, which hold elegantly for the factual past domain, must also apply to the future. That past time is a fair sample of all time is a mistaken metaphysical assumption. (That it is an assumption was argued most persuasively by Hume; that it is a mistaken assumption by Bergson.) Determinism does hold for the past, but if we were not committed to notions of verifiability, truth, and fact which are all past-oriented, it would be evident from our own immediate experience that it does not necessarily follow that such determinism also holds for present or future. This insight, once it is really grasped, can help on the most immediate level to resolve one of the most prevalent of our current human perplexities. We find and teach that there are rigorous causal laws in nature, and also in the behavior of society, which an individual is unable to evade, escape, or alter. On the other hand, we are frequently aware?or made so by court and school when we are not?that we ought not to have acted as we did in a given situa tion. The more intelligent one is, the more intolerable the prob lem seems: God, or the law court, or some super-ego holds us accountable for what we ought to do; and yet, the more we under</page><page sequence="4">650 ROBERT S. BRUMBAUGH stand and analyse our past behavior, the clearer it seems that we could not have acted in any way other than we did. In a more sharply focussed situation, this is often the dilemma of a criminal court: expert testimony by psychiatry and sociology seems in creasingly able to show that the criminal, in that situation, could not have resisted behaving as he did; but the judge and jury insist that he is responsible for a wrong deliberate past choice. This dilemma is the result, I hold, of ignoring the difference between the past as it was when it was present, and as it now is, crystallized into adamant causal chains forged by necessity. Looking back ward, we will never "observe" past open alternatives: every ante cedent will have had one and only one causally related consequent. But this past was once a present moment in which looking forward showed no "future facts," fatalistically deployed, but rather showed relevant alternatives, among which there was opportunity for selec tion. The Kantian nightmare of an agent with a sense of respon sibility caught in a universe of blind, inexorable machinery results from a confused time sense in the dream. It would be a digression to argue that each of Kant's Critiques is exact in its description of one aspect of reality, and that each describes one and only one of the three modalities of time. It is not digressive to point out that, without the problematical hope of the third critique, Kant's view of the human self caught in the natural order is in fact what I have called it?a nightmare, result ing from the time confusions in our dream. Nor is it digressing from my main point to add that our present educational system is doing everything it can to make the tension more acute and the dream more incomprehensible. We are doing an increasingly brisk, precise job in secondary school science of demonstrating the case for a world of fact that admits no glimmer of caprice, freedom, or chance in its causal order. We are doing an increasingly more crucial job in awakening awareness of responsibility in our stu dents. Sometimes they feel this responsibility toward society, sometimes toward their own authenticity. We are doing nothing at all to explain this schizophrenic change in the conception of reality that varies with each move between classrooms. We are upset by the attempts our students make to retain some intellectual integrity: by apathy, by indiscriminate activism, by distrust of an</page><page sequence="5">APPLIED METAPHYSICS: TRUTH AND PASSING TIME 651 intelligence and authority that has set them a puzzle they must solve, with pieces that cannot (and I mean cannot) be fitted together into any solution. They are not too young to learn that it is the difference in time which produces the apparent contra diction; they are not too stupid to understand this ; but we are not wise enough to tell them. This is my first case study of the need for an application to a vital current problem of an abstruse meta physical principle. As a second case, the recognition of this modal character of time has implications for logic that are necessary but perhaps not welcome. Logic, traditionally, is concerned with propositions: propositions refer to states or facts. In "Aristotelian" logic or in Tarski, the correspondence of proposition and referent is definitely the case, or definitely not. And the truth-value remains the same, regardless of the date. But one part of our new discovery about time was stated in the formula that there are no future facts. This means that there are cases?those, namely, of propositions with future time-reference?in which the meaning is definite enough, but the truth is only fractional. A "choice now open" or a "possi bility" has some ontological status; it is not a pure Parmenidean nonentity. It therefore also has some, though indefinite, corre spondence with the propositions asserted about it. If our patterns of thought are to match the patterns of life, our logics must be modified to include indefinite "values." For example, a four valued scheme of 1, 0, ^ 1, and ^z? 0 may be needed to distinguish the degrees of definiteness in the correspondence of assertion to reality. And, in sharp distinction to nearly all antecedent formal systems, those values are in some cases going to change with the relative dates of assertion and reference of the propositions. Otherwise, we perpetuate the illusion that there are future facts, that time is like space, that nothing is lost in translating a problem or decision that confronts us in the present into a language which allows no other modes of existence than the eternal and the past. (Because extended logical tables are not often entertaining when read aloud, I forbear making technical suggestions showing the exact relation of my "indefiniteness values" to standard "prob abilities." However, I will submit these in evidence as an Appen dix when this talk appears in printed form.)</page><page sequence="6">652 ROBERT S. BRUMBAUGH Once we have applied our knowledge of the nature of passing time to the reform of education and the reconstruction of logic, we can turn to a third enterprise. This is not an awakening from a dream nor a better-honing of a blade for Ockham's razor, but the criticism of an ideal construct common in the West to religion, theology, physical science, and some recent developments in psy chology. Whether it was Plato's fault (as Heidegger believes) or not, the paradigm case of "knowledge" was taken in the West to be the geometric diagram. Add to this the multiplication table, the geographical map, and the taxonomic chart, and we have the material for a mistaken ideal construct of a being that knows every thing. The ideal is formed by combining our pleasure in those facts that fit neatly in chart and map, with a rejection of the uncertainty that attaches to areas not so neatly charted. Now, such an ideal knower is useful for various theoretic and expressive purposes, and is used in many ways. The most striking cases, of course, are the three major religions of the West, which, in trying to express a profound religious intuition, attribute omniscience to a supreme being. Omniscience is then defined as perfectly determinate, non temporal knowledge of "all things," present, future, or past, on the model of the scholar whose map shows him "all the cities of men," north, south, east, or west. I have no quarrel with the intuition expressed, or with the doctrine of omniscience as an analogical mode of its expression. But I do want to point out that omniscience can only mean "knowing everything that there is to be known," and since time is unlike space, there are no future facts for any being to know. Too literal an interpretation of a powerful insight has led to the dilemma of a God who foreknows the future, creates a world in which that foreknown detailed plan will neces sarily unfold, and then judges individuals innocent or guilty as a result of choices for which God holds them responsible. The ten sion is barely tolerable; in the end, the religious vision may be more compelling than the logical and ethical problem it brings with it, and, as with St. Augustine, the doctrine is accepted?though not understood?in the interest of the vision. But it seems to me wrong to insist that true faith rest on acceptance of a metaphysical absurdity. Two ways are open for our further search for under standing here. The first, explored by Whitehead, Hartshorne, and</page><page sequence="7">APPLIED METAPHYSICS: TRUTH AND PASSING TIME 653 Weiss has a divine mind and divine knowledge cognizant of, hence changing with, passing time. The second way, which should not offend anyone familiar with past discussions of the sense in which words apply to human and divine attributes, is to see and say clearly that "knowledge" as understood in past discussions of omni science is used in an eminent sense, and, as applied to God, must go beyond and be quite other than the literal anthropomorphic scholar with his pen and map. Whatever this eminent omniscience may be, it need not be incompatible with human responsibility and free dom. The same objection applies to the scientist's ideal of Laplace's demon or angel: given the state of all matter at an instant, this hypothetical superior mind can calculate every future fact and date it. This notion, too, is a construct that ignores the difference between space and time; its assumption of future facts, determined but simply inscrutable to ourselves, is quite inconsistent with notions of purpose and responsibility, including the behavior of the scientist himself. Whitehead has made the point so well in the first chapter of The Function of Reason that I have nothing to add here. On a more specific empirical level, not only does our knowledge of time require reconsideration of the divine in theol ogy, of the demonic in Laplacian demonology (or angelology), but of the human in parapsychology. Claimed cases of precognition, that is, of a vision in full factual detail of future events which the agent himself does not then proceed to bring about, though this claim has been accepted from the time of the youth of Aristotle, must rest on a misinterpretation of the evidence at hand. As an applied metaphysician, my function is to raise questions and start discussion of the implications of basic principles, not to confuse my role with that of the expert in theology, statistics, or extra-normal psychology; so on this point I will say no more. II I have been exploring the implications of the fact that time has different modalities. I now intend to turn to a second aspect of our discovery that time is not like another spatial dimension. Any sequence of events in which there is a series of ordered increments of transformation from remotely possible to actually attainable to</page><page sequence="8">654 ROBERT S. BRUMBAUGH actual is a case of passing time. There are only four kinds of such series that I recognize as distinctive types, vibration, growth, pure extension, and sequences of subjective experience in memory and anticipation. But the public time, clock-time, which we construct to synchronize our private ventures and lives with those of others is only one of the four. There is considerable convenience in correlating a "time" series with some uniform motion in space; the main advantage, I suppose, is that we can use spatial techniques to show what the "successive equal increments" are, and measure their "extension." But there is a total metaphysical error involved in proceding to assume that this particular type of series, that of public time, is uniquely real, or objective, or identical for everyone. As a matter of fact, time in nature and in art is a series of successive realizations of increments of maturity or of completed form. Here ordinary language, (which lets us down completely in most discussions of temporality) has already recognized that there are successive equal increments of human maturity. These are not equal projected against the calendar; growth has a different structural plan. (If we trust ordinary speech here, it tends to mark out increments that are logarithmic functions of equal calendar units.) But our habit of assuming that a given five minutes is "the same length of time for everyone" has led to over looking obvious indications that it is nothing of the sort, and as a result to serious practical mistakes. These mistakes are of three kinds: wrong ethical judgments between generations that disrupt human harmony, wrong factual judgments of four distinct types that inhibit personal effectiveness, wrong notions of our own control of temporality that lead us to cheat ourselves of longevity. Once we recognize that growth takes place at a rate that slows down with age when we use the calendar as its measure, we can also recognize that the rate of experience and the resulting "length" and "shortness" of given clock periods must also change. Aristotle remarked that a child on the second day of its life doubles its total number of increments of experience; to do this for the man at the "height of his intellectual powers" (which Aristotle set at 49, in a passage written when he was about 49 years old) would require 17,795 times as long. Yet Aristotle goes on, in the irascible spirit</page><page sequence="9">APPLIED METAPHYSICS: TRUTH AND PASSING TIME 655 of all adult custodians of children, to describe them as deprived adults, deficient by nature in temperance, patience, attention-span, and understanding of their elders. (For example, Archytas had invented a new baby rattle; Plato, unmarried and childless, admired it because it began to teach rhythm and mathematics earlier; Aristotle thought its more important virtue was that it kept children from breaking up the furniture, "since young things can not be still.") The fact is that time is not the same length for everyone; it correlates at a different rate with increments of bore dom or activity per tick of the clock. I can wait patiently in the dentist's office, with the serene virtue of an adult attaining the years of full intellectual perfection, for a quarter of an hour. But my daughter Joanna is a distracting companion. "It seems forever"; "It's been an awfully long time"; "Let's play another game now." This shows, it seems to a right-thinking parent, that children just are not as disciplined, well-organized, or patient as we are; their memories are not objective, either?Joanna tells her mother that our short wait "took forever," which is an absurd distortion. But forget the clock, and look at what is relevant: the number of increments of experience that make up our sub jective times. Joanna, in her time scale, has been as patient, i.e., has sat through as many boring stretches of her life, in four min utes as I have in my wait through fifteen. I have been expecting her to be four times as patient as I am, and felt it a moral short coming, in need of discipline, when she does not measure up to this extraordinary expectation. We tend to excuse young daughters and be kind to them, but also to describe them as deficient in our own excellences. We retain the impatience, but begin to discon tinue the kindness and excuses, when our sons of college age show incredible lack of prudence in planning ahead. Ten years from now, just two more years of study could make the difference be tween a well-paid, effective career and a precarious vagabondage, we explain. Measured by our own time sense, two years has been one twenty-fifth of my lifetime; not very long. For an eighteen year-old it is more than ten percent of his whole life to date. If I were asked to commit five years of my career now toward the prospect of a security I do not now want, in the year 1991, it would not be my immediate impulse to embrace the chance! I am not</page><page sequence="10">656 ROBERT S. BRUMBAUGH sure, either, that I would react kindly to the insistence of my elders that the advantage was so obvious that I was a fool and an ingrate for not seeing it, or taking their word for it. Young men will judge the lengths of time by projecting fractions of the total life experience they have had, and the average content per calendar year of that experience, into anticipated plans; old men will do the same. Since it is the same clock and calendar, we are tempted to assume that there is an objective "length" to two years, the same for everyone. But what we are doing is to substitute an irrelevant for a relevant type of time, under the hypnotic delusion that equal time increments must correlate with equal intervals of space. This may sound less like a discussion of reality than a plati tudinous admonition for kindness to children. But it is in fact a direct application of a metaphysical principle: that there are mul tiple series of one-directional modal transformations each of which is a time-series, and that contrary to general opinion, increments that are equal in one time-line may well be unequal when projected into another. To take scales which correlate successive temporal increments of transformation with equally extended spatial incre ments certainly makes the time-series so defined more publically useful; it has nothing to do with the question of whether this peculiar type of time scale is in any way exclusively real. One of the most amazing things about subjective time is the extent to which we ourselves structure and control it. We are able, for example, to divide and order our experiences, memories, and anticipations quite unrealistically. Just as an observer projects visual forms into an indeterminate field, we project patterns of closure, separation, and differentiation onto our temporal adven tures. In extreme cases, this results in monochrome, subjective time senses. Catatonia and mania are extreme examples of an in ability to combine objective input of experience with coherent sub jective forms of time. Napoleon, a good observer if not a great metaphysician, had a relevant remark. "Some men," he said, "Always picture the future in their minds as a detailed, complete tableau. Such men are dangerous." I suppose he meant dan gerous as field commanders; as human beings in private life. I think they are less dangerous than sad. What they are doing is confusing the closed detail of memory with anticipation: the future</page><page sequence="11">APPLIED METAPHYSICS: TRUTH AND PASSING TIME 657 always fails, in some detail, to match the tableau that was expected. The sense of time is jammed in such a way that it can use only the perfective patterns which organize a past, even when it is the in ceptive ones leading into a future that are objectively appropriate. Or we can find cases of refusal to accept time altogether; of in ability to escape a knife-edge present and relate it to the rest of life; of optimistic inceptive thinking which, perpetually hopeful, always begins afresh with no learning from experience that the future is not determined, but is indeed limited, by the past. (A poker player convinced on every hand that if he discards four cards, he will get four aces this time, is an extreme case in point.) Here is an area where metaphysics touches on psychology. We can offer some suggestions as to what does constitute a realistic modal patterning of time, and what selective attention to aspects of that pattern are responsible for wrong generalizations under emotional impulses toward security, self-assertion, self-annihilation, and flight. I should like to develop this theme with reference to language, and argue that the dominance of the past-pessimistic, perfective aspect over the future-euphoric, inceptive shows that the givers of names in Indo-European tongues have always been the old men of the tribe. I forbear both for lack of time and from a distaste for per petrating any further discussions of language: a moratorium of half a century on this theme might do us good. Finally, let me point out a relation of applied metaphysics to longevity. We have so much control over time in our experience that we are able to regulate how many increments of subjective experience we encounter for a given unit of the time of calendar, clock, and life-span. Within certain objective limitations (which can be indicated, I think, by equations that are, like logical tables, very dull to hear read), the choice is our own. "Longevity" can be defined, of course, in two ways: in the extension of conscious experience through the extension sequence of calendar and clock; or in the total content of such experience in its sequence, intensity, and order. Each is a legitimate definition for its own purposes; since my present purpose is humanistic rather than actuarial, it is the second meaning that I have in mind. To illustrate my point, I would like to introduce a simple account of two of my own every</page><page sequence="12">658 ROBERT S. BRUMBAUGH day adventures. Often?though not as often as I should?I go from my office in Saybrook College to the Yale Library. On Monday, I am in a hurry to get there; a new book has just come in. My trip from office to library is an uninterrupted, single experience, taking about four minutes of wrist-watch time. On Tuesday, I set out again, with less determination to hurry and get there. It is a late summer day, with a rising wind that feels as though autumn is near. I look up at the weather vane in the shape of a plump owl, who ornaments a campus tower. A grey squirrel scuttles past, running furiously along the Trumbull College wall. The wind shifts and now gusts blow across High Street from the Cross Campus; I look at the weather-vane again, and see him turning majestically. That trip involved four increments of expe rience, and also took four minutes of wrist-watch time. In other words, on Tuesday my excursion contained four times as many increments of experience per unt of clock time as it did on Monday ! This is what I mean by creating more time for ourselves. I hope these applications have been reasonable and clear. I have no doubt they have been interesting, since I agree with Kant that metaphysicians take a natural interest in God, freedom, and longevity (a surrogate here for immortality) ; and in this matter, every human being is a metaphysician by nature. The question is not whether we shall apply metaphysics, but whether we apply it well or badly. In these variations on my theme, I have not intended to be frivolous or erroneous. Fortunately, I have as my commentator a metaphysician who has already been practicing what I have preached; and I trust he will point out any failures there may be in the execution of my intention. AN APPENDIX ON PASSAGE Several earlier versions of this paper were jettisoned, at the instance of my commentator and the Editor of The Review of Meta physics, because they contained tables and equations which do not fascinate an audience forced to hear them read. The present ver sion, concentrating on one main theme with brief suggestive varia</page><page sequence="13">APPLIED METAPHYSICS: TRUTH AND PASSING TIME 659 tions, has seemed insufficiently technical and sombre. We have compromised by allowing me an Appendix in which to illustrate two points in more detail. My main thesis is that time is, of course, unreal; what Platonist can deny thatP But different orders have different ad mixtures of non-being: all preserve some semblance of the pure order of number series and repeating cycle, but as we move from being to becoming the coerciveness and determinateness of this vestigial form decrease. I want here to illustrate a method of proximate abstraction, by isolation of relevant form without reduc tion of it to so much simpler a level that one loses the very peculiarities under study. I will take up three topics: the logical relations of a formal system with three "tenses" stated in its most general form; the alternative logical possibilities for "rules of passage" that can correlate changes of modality with some standard clock-and-calendar scale; and, briefly, the single formal objective limitation I can find that determines how we can structure, expand, or contract our subjective "experience time." In the first part, the interest lies in the generality of the logical relations : without more special information than we get from knowing that propositions have future possibilities as referents, there is incorrigible ambiguity in what we can determine about their logical relations. However, four distinct formal systems without this ambiguity result when we add additional postulates about the structure of the relevant realm of possibility. In the second part, a formal matrix is offered in partial explication of what seems the fact that truth-values of differ ent types of statement change historically in different ways. I will not claim that this clears up the "logical peculiarities" of, for ex ample, religious language, nor even that it offers an exhaustive plan of ways in which different kinds of talk are logically peculiar. But I will claim that it helps to clarify the question. In the third sec tion, I will suggest that human life faces us with constant choices between confused longevity and shorter-lived order. I will also offer one equation that is of considerable interest in defining, creat ing, or avoiding environmental monotony.</page><page sequence="14">660 ROBERT S. BRUMBAUGH I Suppose we use a four-valued logic, where 1 and 0 refer to definite truth or falsity, ^ 0 to an indefinite state of "non-falsity," r? 1 to an indefinite state of "non-truth." I take ^ 1 to be the non-definite relation holding between a proposition with a future referent and the status of that referent as a possibility; ^ 0 is the special case in which the future referent is an option, i.e., where it is "actually" possible, and realizable by an increment of choice. (This was the suggestion I used in my article, "Logic and Time," The Review of Metaphysics [1965]. But my present scheme differs from and is much better than the one proposed in that article.) Using a "weak" notion of negation (so that ? ?p = p) and other standard connectives, the following table shows the resulting logic.

("Causal relevance" here is limited to "efficient causality.") Also note that four compound values are '*': neither specifiable as definite nor as indefinite. This is not corrigible in any general scheme which claims to apply to all types of futures, just insofar as they are future. Third, note that this will not be an easy logic to work with: familiar equivalences, such as that of p 0 q and ? pvq break down, as do other rules, e.g., ~ (p ?p). But also note that no assumptions are introduced beyond that of a fact ?option?possibility, or modality, so that the plan has the max imum possible generality consistent with its interpretation as a logic applicable to passage. Four special added postulates result in four standard logical systems as special cases of this table, cases in which all or some of the annoying ambiguities of the '*' values are removed. Special Case I. Assume that there are future facts, but we do not know them. Assume further that "logic" is concerned with what is the case, rather than with vagaries in our determination of this. Then the referents of propositions reduce back to 1 or 0, and we get the standard two-valued calculus which works per fectly for factual and atemporal domains. Special Case II. Assume that all possibilities are actually pos sible. This leads to a new and interesting system which my colleague, Professor Milton Fisk, is exploring. The assumption makes it possible to replace both my 7^ 0 and ^ 1 values by the single indefinite value, u. Two sets of logical constants preserve the difference between types and directions of inference. Special Case HI. This accepts Professor Fisk's postulate that all possibilities are actual, and adds that they can be arranged in branched distinct sets of successive options. (Moves in chess are a typical case which these assumptions fit.) At this point, the general case reduces to a version of standard probability calculus. In its simplest form, we let P be the "probability" of p, defined as the number of occurrences of p's in an option set over the total number of elements p + p'. If the set is not "immediate," i.e., if</page><page sequence="16">662 ROBERT S. BRUMBAUGH its initial condition itself depends on selections made among "previous" sets, we correct P. The result is a probability scheme in which the probabilities of compound propositions as wholes are a function of those of their components. Notice that in a situation where the future is in fact ordered in this way, the '*' values of the general case become determinate fractions.

That is, instead of ^ 0, we might be able to say that p has a value ^ 0, and between 1 and 1/2. This may be the way to represent an</page><page sequence="17">APPLIED METAPHYSICS: TRUTH AND PASSING TIME 663 Aristotelian logic which actually does something with the proposi tions of "indefinite quantity" that figure in the De Interpretatione, but disappear in later "Aristotelian" logic. One can find some clues to these indefinite ranges in passages where Aristotle defines "many," "few," "most," and so on. How useful the extension is in reasoning can only be determined by trying it out. II However, while the table of "modalities" and the logical rela tions between them can be given various interpretations as relations of tenses or aspects at any given state, there is nothing in its pattern to indicate the fact that time does pass?i.e., that some values are invariant, but others are subject to change. It is just this combination of fixity and variability that characterizes the world of becoming; and we need to add a rule of "passage" to com plete the "definiteness" table. But what is the rule? This turns out to be a surprisingly interesting question, because the minimum formal conditions necessary for serial "passage" are very per missive. Starting with the case of descriptive propositions, which we have been tacitly assuming as the propositions in our logical table, the rule is clear. A logic applies to passage when its values divide into "facts" which remain fixed and definite, and "options" or "possibilities" where values become definite after a certain num ber of increments of transformation of option into fact. [V (p) t+ # (1 V 0)] o [V (p) tO + ndt = (1 v 0)] [V (p) tO = (1 V 0)1 id [V (p) tO + ndt = (1 v 0)] V(p)t-=(1V0) V(p)t0 = (*0) V(p)t-=(#1). This is a tidy flow, in which choices transform options into facts, possibilities become actualized or excluded, tO is an objective ontological "now," and ndt any set of increments of clock-and calendar "time." But is there any formal need that modal change and normal physical time-direction be related in this way ? Not at all; for the rule could be generalized and still prescribe a passage situation.</page><page sequence="18">664 ROBERT S. BRUMBAUGH [V (s) t ? 0 = (1 V 0)] V [ V (s) t ? ndt = (1 V 0)] [V (s) tO = ( ? 1 - # 0)] 3 [V (s) ? ndt = (1 V 0)] [V (s) tO = (1 V 0)] =&gt; [V (s) t ? ndt = (1 v 0)]. In this formula, s is a variable ranging over "statements"; V is extended to "expressive truth" or similar properties as well as standard "truth-value"; and while modalities change for some cases, not for others, with the "increments of passage," ndt, nothing says in what direction the change occurs. What made me think of this possibility of alternative logical patterns of changing truth and passage was the comment by Dr. Robert Neville that perhaps religious expressions lost some of their absolute expressive truth whenever they became past. (He did not mean to say, I am sure, that past expressions of this type are inadequate if we can grasp and reassert them in the present; but that as past expres sions, they could only be fractionally "true" in a given present.) In that case, there are a number of definable truth-and-passage patterns possible relating the ways modality stays fixed and changes relative to a tO, t+ , and t? fixed by the "physical sequence" given in our first, more specific, rules of passage. The fixed and chang ing modalities could lie in any combination of our three t-domains, as the table shows. Table III.?Possible Relations of Changing Modalities to a Standard Clock-time System (1 in this table equals a definite or fixed modality, 0 a modality that transforms with increments added or subtracted.)</page><page sequence="19">APPLIED METAPHYSICS: TRUTH AND PASSING TIME 665 Rows 1 and 8 are not types of passage; row 1, because it rather describes factual or atemporal statements, row 8 because it describes incorrigibly unfixable ones (Russell's paradox, for ex ample) . Row 4 is the standard pattern where fixed values are in t ? , changing ones in tO and t + . Row 6 is the pattern Dr. Neville suggests, where definite values are always in a present, but change to indefinite as one moves to t? or t-f . Promises, contracts, and so on are statements that may have the peculiar value-shift behavior pattern of line 5; but they may not. The point is the very light hand placed on the reins of passing time by the eternal forms, which set invariant boundaries and laws to passage. Ill Moving to the most elusive series that still have form enough to qualify as passing times, I would like to conclude by saying a bit more about the weathervane-owl. So far as the formal defini tions go, any sequence of modal transformations that meets the passage rule above is a set of increments of a time, ndt. Our ordinary preference is for special sets which we can correlate with congruent bits of spatial extension; but the preference is ours, not nature's. Our experiences, for example, insofar as we remember them as single episodes bounded by events, form a subjective time. There are only two controls that I can see imposing form on this series from without. The first is that it agrees with physical and biological process in its direction: that is, the invariant items lie in the domain of the "past," t?. The second is, that we can only divide happenings from each other into increments of experience when there is some objective change in the rate of acceleration of our "input" of sensations and ideas.* But these two objective *This means, if we were to represent input of experience as a curve, that it must be changes in the third derivative which are the potential points of division. Borrowing terms from E. M. Berkeley, we can call a unified single "experience" a state and a dividing-point an event. Then this con dition becomes a definition of states and events: for states, dl8/d8t=k; for events, dP/d3t # k (I is intensity, t is clock-time). An important pair of corollaries follow.

BRUMBAUGH limitations are such faint shadows of strict formal order that they are consistent with all varieties of experience, attention, and memory. One can see at once that hyper-sensitivity will result in a blurred confusion of events, with no stable states of experience identified and divided by them; and that total anaesthesia leads to a single, uneventful state making up the sole increment of a sub jective life time. Human beings have the surprising, and not always welcome, power of trading vividness for order. (Vivid ness is defined here as the number of successive states of experience in a life-span, order as their concentrated hierarchical integration.) One kind of "concentration," and the one we usually stress in education, shuts off "distractions" and gets order at the price of vividness. An alternative power of attention, which we must add to our educational scheme, notices the individual, the con crete, the ephemeral; this increases vividness. For optimum human "longevity" we should find the best balance of both: vivid chaos is longer, subjectively, but lucid pursuit of echeloned goals and principles is necessary if life is to have its full value.

Second, when we try to counteract monot ony by any planned regular change (continuously shifting sequences of sound, position, lighting) we run the risk, if dl2/d2t is constant, of increas ing it.</page></plain_text>
