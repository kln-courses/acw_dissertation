Matsuda, Japan OLYMPUS IN HIGH ASIA BY B. A. DEVERE BAILEY University of Michigan Sometime during the first century of the Christian era, the vanguard of a new doctrine marched out of the valleys of Kashmir in Northern India, leading a movement destined to leaven the social fabric of a greater part of Asia, and to bequeath a rich heritage of art to posterity. The Caval- cade of the Gods of Northern Buddhism was under way, and gaining momentum spread fan-like in an ever-widen- ing arc of power. Eventually their aegis extended from the Sea of Japan to the Persian border and from Siberia to Soerabaja. Even Tibet, long isolated citadel of sorcery and the genii of earth, air and water, capitulated before this alien tide. So utterly, indeed, that Lhasa is today credited with preserving unique records of Buddhist dogma and Buddhist ritual. The Gods from High Asia might be likened to a large and well-schooled company of mummers, enacting a drama whose leitmotif was a synthesis of human experiences. Panoply and pageantry, rite and ritual, para- dise and purgatory, sin and salvation-all were paraded before audiences ripe for emotional release from the auster- ities of simpler faiths. The formulas of Northern Buddhism were carefully devised to provide a broad pattern of life and easy access to immortality. A spiritual democracy offered new horizons of hope to the lowly and salvation to the outcast. A system of theology supplanted a system of Ed. note: We regret that some of the diacritical mnarks were impossible to obtain. ethics-metaphysical ideas were dramatized in terms of common understanding. The Gods of Northern Buddhism achieved popularity because their offering was "good theatre". It may be noted at this point that "Northern Buddhism", so often associated only with Tibet, Nepal and other adjacent areas, is in reality that form of the faith which besides strongly tincturing Indian religious life during its greatest popularity, early penetrated into China, and thence to Japan via Korea. Later it was carried to other countries, where, as in China and Japan, it persists as the represen- tative type of Buddhism. Further reference will be made to distinctions between "Northern" and "Southern" Buddhism, since the latter-sometimes termed the "primi- tive" form-exists today in Ceylon, Burma, and Siam, not, however, without considerable admixture of extrane- ous elements. The geneses of these widely divergent types of Buddhist thought and the creation of a synthetic pantheon which not only strongly influenced the art of a greater part of Asia but for several centuries actually constituted much of that art, form an interesting chapter in the cultural history of the Far East. Of that chapter only a bare outline may be recorded in these notes, and the gods must be largely considered en masse; reserving the discussion of individual deities and their origins for a later paper. Nor will any effort be made to evaluate the SIXTEEN</page><page sequence="2">religion itself, ex- cept within the relatively narrow confines of those aspects with which we are briefly con- cerned. In current critiques of Asiatic culture it is prob- able that the dis- cussion of art is too often subordi- nated to theologi- cal controversy.

But in attempting to find a critical estimate of Buddhism which shall accurately and impartially set down its history, no less difficulty is experienced than in discovering two authorities in agree- ment upon its faults and its virtues as a theory of religion. In fact, current estimates run the entire gamut of varying opinions, and the two poles of antithetic thought are reached in the annals of the missionary theologian re- turning from Asia with his orthodoxy unimpaired, and the contemporary historian who recognizes in Buddhism excellent material for a thesis on the ultimate in optimism. Without reference to either of these, it is possible that an accurate mean exists between the intensely interesting if pessimistic critique of Buddhism recently furnished by L. A. Waddell in the revised edition of his Buddhism of Tibet, and the effusive panegyric delivered by Kenneth Saunders in his ambitious opus The Pageant of Asia. The relative merits of these two discussions cannot be consid- ered here, nor the possibility of bias estimated, but the competence of Colonel Waddell in his particular field is K' of hardly debatable. The story of Buddha Gotama, sage of the Sikya clan, and founder of Buddhism, has ba-, F een told too many times to warrant repeating here. Of his historicity there t seems to be no doubt, but much of sohis life remains ob- images of inte d scure and even the date of his birth is controversial. It is quite evident that Although durinhis personality has ty a , tt he ws been invested with more than the usual which appareny p d b n glamor attached to the propagator of a world-religion, and aside from ob- t s s (rec vious myths there ~symbolis a wealth of purely apocryphal detail.

The magic of the sorcerer in contemporaneous India was pervasive, and images of intended victims his most potent instruments. The fancied efficacy of his spells gave rise to intensive iconoclasm-particularly evident during the propagation of a new doctrine. Although during Buddha's lifetime his system was essen- tially aniconic, that he was atheistic is negatived by his frequent references to Brihmanic gods as followers and protectors of his faith. In spite of mutual antagonism which apparently prevailed between Gotama and the BrMhmanic hierarchy, we find in the earliest existing Buddhist stiipas (relic mounds), ample evidence that the symbolism employed was derived directly from Vedic for- mulas, and doubtless hearken back to Indo-Aryan proto- types. With Buddha's putative debt to Jainism in the formu- lation of his doctrines, and the eventual domination of Buddhism by the philosophy of the Upanishads, we need SEVENTEEN</page><page sequence="3">Courtesy of Roland Moore Galleries BHAISAJYARAJA CHINESE, XVII CENTURY A bronze figure of the "Medicine King" not concern ourselves here. Nor is it pertinent to this dis- cussion whether the influence of Asoka in spreading Buddha Gotama's system and his lifetime support saved the doc- trine from the Pari-nirvana which enveloped its founder. Of more concern is the rise of a theistic Buddhism, fore- runner of the Gods of the Northern School. This, in em- bryo form at least, seems to have been a development of the intense propagation of the doctrine by Asoka, grandson of Chandra-gupta, and regarded as the greatest of all Indian emperors. Beginning his long reign about 270 B.C., Asoka made Buddhism the national religion during the next decade at his capital, Pataliputra, the "City of Sweet- Scented Flowers." Emperor, Buddhist monk, and propa- gandist, Asoka two centuries after Sakya-muni's death memorialized the Sage's travels in India by erecting huge monolithic towers at the places he visited. Elaborately decorated shrines followed; in sacred plays Buddha was represented quelling demon enemies, and Shakra, the Indra of the Devas, Brahma, and Isvara the "Self-Existent" begin to appear as auditors, disciples and defenders of the Law. Thus subjective anthropomorphism slowly realized ob- jective expression-the deity began to take material form. Dr. Coomaraswamy is inclined to date this transition from "elemental to personal conception" of the Hindu gods to at least as early as the second century B.C. but Buddhism in a representational sense seems to have retained its aniconic character until about the first century of the Christian era. It is well to remember that equally in Buddhist as in Hindu thought, the abstract idea of the image-complete in minute detail-long preceded the con- crete form of the deity as an icon. This subjective creation of an ethos obeyed well-defined formulas, expressed through sadhands, means, which provided a descriptive basis for visualization of the divine form. As imaginary flowers and other votive offerings were tendered to the conceptual Hindu deity, so vicarious worship of Buddha took shape shortly after his death in homage paid by his adherents to putative relics of Sakya-muni's person, immured in stupas. Later, symbolic forms-again used in obeisance to Vedic tradition-graced altars as yet barren of icons, but the Bodhi-tree of Enlightenment, the holy Foot-Print, and the Wheel of the Law, used symbolically with countless other forms, furnished easy transition to the actual repre- sentation of Buddha in theistic shape. The creation and worship of Buddha's own image ap- pears to date from the first century A.D., and was probably coeval with the historical schism in Buddhist thought which resulted in the formation of two distinct schools- termed in the Occident-"Northern" and "Southern." Professor Rhys-Davids takes issue with these definitions, arguing that the revelatory Sanskrit MSS. in each case had common origins. The criticism, however, seems beside the point, since the terms are chiefly and conveniently used to define the present-day distribution of the respec- tive doctrines, with perhaps justifiable reference also to the approximate original spheres of influence in a geo- graphical sense. This in no wise precludes the idea of interpermeation, but rather assesses the aegis of each school to areas where it normally prevailed. That the "Southern" or "Primitive" school was leavened by Mahayana (North- ern) principles, or that the latter extending into terri- tory of the Hinayana (Southern) school became for a time predominant in all India, seem merely to show re- ciprocal diffusion of elements of a religion still in flux. The controversial issue which caused the cleavage was the theistic Mahayana doctrine, a speculative system that replaced the agnostic idealism of Sakya-muni with an iconic mysticism providing approachable and incarnate deity and the promise of universal salvation for its adher- ents. Since the latter believed their vehicle of transporta- tion across Samsara-the Sea of Life-to Nirvana, was all- containing, they termed it the "Mahayana," or "Greater Vehicle," while those content with the "primitive" teach- ings of the founder, were relegated to a less capacious con- veyance-the "Hinayana" or "Lesser Vehicle." M. Anesaki in his erudite exposition of Buddhist Art (in Japan), re- fers inception of the Books of the Broader Communion (Mahayana) to the "centuries in the pre-Christian era." But there seems little reason to doubt current authority in allocating the actual schism to a council presided over by Kanishka, most noted ruler of the Indo-Scythian or Kushan empire, at Jalandhar, in Northern India, held a little be- fore or during the first century A.D. The idea of Nirvana had not been completely abandoned by the Mahayanists, but its survival was in a somewhat diluted form, since a middle, paradisical stage of uncertain duration, had been provided. Hope, too, was held out to the ordinary adherent of attaining Bodhisatship or poten- tial Buddhahood, denied him by the Hinayana, whose doc- trine precluded his progressing beyond the state of an Arhat or disciple-sometimes defined as an "ascetic ripe for annihilation." However, perhaps the most compelling feature of this newly developed Mahayana doctrine was the promise of universal salvation held out to its devotees. This was to be gained through the intervention of a gradu- EIGHTEEN</page><page sequence="4">ally increasing number of merciful Bodhisattvas, illumi- nati, who though qualified for Buddhahood renounced it to redeem mankind. It is fairly evident that at the time of his deification, Gotama Buddha was invested with a :: dual r6le-as the one Buddha and the one Bodhisattva. These twin personages in one were natural cause and effect, respectively, of his own teachings; and iconic representa- tion of Sakya-muni as a Bodhisattva is fairly common. With expansion of the theistic principle of the Mahayana, however, each important episode in the Buddha's life was thought to require a different form for the protagonist, and these shapes readily merged by idealization into a group of Celestial Buddhas. The latter, as purely meta- ' physical deities took on separate identities, and from each a human Buddha was evolved as a material reflex of the Jina or Celestial form. It has been suggested that this complicated and purely synthetic pantheon was created by the Mahayanist hierarchy to provide both a terminus a quo and a metaphysical futurity for their new doctrine of salvation. Thus in nicely determined sequence was evolved an Olympian personnel of precedent Buddhas i1 and Buddhas yet to be, with attendant Bodhisattvas, re- flexes, and alternate manifestations. Sakya-muni, meanwhile, although regarded as a Manushi or Human Buddha in corporeal form, was declared to be e existent without beginning or end; and initially at least, was the pivotal deity in the new pantheon. Since Buddha himself was apparently not reluctant to borrow from Brah- manism, it is scarcely surprising that both dii majores and a vast army of Devas, Yakias and Nagas, Gandharvas and Asuras-culled from an all-abundant Hindu mythology and from Aryan prototypes, made gradual penetration of the Mahayana system, there to be enrolled with the other divinities of recent creation. Even many of the consid- erable array of female deities of increase and later avatars of matriarchal types deriving from the Vedic era, are traceable in cognate forms of the Northern pantheon.

Since this new element involved the adoration of female energies, spouses of the Hindu god Siva, consorts were given to the group of Celestial Bodhisattvas, as well as to the Dhyani or Meditative Buddhas, and to many of the dii muinores, including the demon forms. Because much im- portance was attached to propitiation of malignant forces, these accretions were particularly w-orshipped, and the Mahayina doctrine was soon invested with the complicated ceremonial of a fully developedritual. Preceding the introduction of the T-intrik forms, the Mahayana doctrine had been permeated by the Brahmanical cult of Yoga through the efforts of Asainga, a Buddhist monk from Gandhara in Peshawar, and this pantheistic system is said to yet tincture Buddhism in modern Ceylon and Burma, since it had originally been to some extent Coulrtesy Wells Galler,y adopted by the adherents of the "Lesser Vehicle".

Y. ment which lead to inevitable decadence of the "Greater Vehicle" and finally to the slow destruction of Buddhism in all India, which was completely effected by the Muslim invasion in the latter part of the twelfth century A.D. In thus recording the Gotterdimmerung of the North- ern Pantheon in their cradle-land, it is only fair to add that their extinction was only local-they had already found further life-cycles in other lands with Kalpas of indeterminate duration, like existence in the Paradise of the West. The heritage of art with which these deities endowed every land that received them, has added appreci- ably to the art vocabulary of the world. The measure of India's debt to the Buddhist mood is highly controversial, but it seems certain that borrowings from Brahmanic forms were paid back with generous interest in the shape of much fresh material and an iconography rich in the implications of a spiritually developed aestheticism. And these, perhaps, enabled Hindui successors to build a newer and, conceiv- ably, a little finer structure of art. There are those who disagree with Dr. Griinwedel's dictum that the entire de- velopment of that period of art represented by the Gand- hara sculptures belongs to the Mahiayna school, and his more inclusive statement that the Gandhara period fos- tered all subsequent Buddhist-as well as Brahmanic-art, is probably open to argument. There is little question, however, that as a religion Buddhism-and more particularly the Mahayana phase- has exerted a profound influence upon life and art through- out the Far East. And often in the case of the latter, Buddhism has injected new and vigorous blood in alien artistic veins where it was running thin. Perhaps we may thus account for Leigh Ashton's appraisal of Buddhist in- fluence on the Chinese scene as a flood that swept over the land and created a great religious art. However viable China's art may have been at the beginning of the Chris- tian era, it is fairly obvious that contemporary plastic endeavor was merely in chrysalis form so far as anthropo- morphic representation was concerned, until quickened by Buddhist stimulus; and that Buddhist inspiration was in- strumental in shaping many of the other and later art expressions of China, can hardly be denied. It may be said that all significant forms of Japanese art derived directly from Buddhism, since the only spiritual expression before the coming of the new doctrine was Shint6, which re- quired no cultus-figure, and therefore eliminated necessity for creating ornament or any but the most elemental architecture. This influence seems to have begun as early as the uiko epoch (593-628 A.D.), when Buddhism in Japan began a history of remarkable artistic achievement, which was to culminate in the Wado, Y6or, and beginning of the Tempy5 eras of the First Nara epoch (708-749 A.D.). It is not possible in these notes to do more than point out a very few of the many channels which have carried the artistic phenomena of Buddhism down the long vista of the centuries. Such monumental achievements as those at Boro Budur in Java and the remains of a nearly forgot- ten empire in Cambodia must, however, carry some realiza- tion, at least, of the imperishable imprints made by the Gods of the Northern Pantheon. Objection may be had that the temple of Angkor Wat was ruled by the deities of the Brahman cults, and that Buddha when he came later to substitute the Wheel of the Law for the lingam of Siva, found an Olympus impervious to either change or destruc- tion. In rebuttal to this it may be said that it is often diffi- cult to determine where iva leaves off and Buddha begins, since iconographic distinctions often merely cloak subjective affinities. The theory that survival of Buddhism on foreign soil was often predicated upon its ability to absorb (Continued on page 37) TWENTY</page><page sequence="6">TERRA COTTA MADONNAS (Continued from page 8) be in vain if we would try to trace it farther back in Florentine painting to Giotto. It is connected much more closely with a Virgin of the school of Pacino di Buonaguida in the Johnson collection in Philadelphia where the child's pose is exactly as in the terra- cotta Virgins. From here the group can be traced only outside Florence. One trend continues to Siena where above all Ambrogio Lorenzetti uses the motif in his Madonnas. Before him the motif occurs in XIII cen- tury Madonnas at the Carmine Church at Siena and in the Kaiser Friedrich Museum at Berlin. Another trend-and this trend may be even more important-goes back to Lucca, as far back as to the painting in the Academy in Florence about 1250 attributed by van Marle to the school of Bonaventura Berlinghieri: again the mother presses the child against her face and again the child stretches his legs against her forearm. In these paintings of the XIII century the rela- tion to Byzantine art becomes evident. Indeed it is this motive which is char- acteristic of one of the two Byzantine types of the "Glykophilusa" or "Eleusa", the "tenderly loving" or "merciful" Virgin which is quite com- mon in Byzantine icons and manu- scripts (fig. 6), and which must have been known at least since the XI cen- tury, since about 1085 it influenced one of the murals in the church of St. Clemente in Rome and not very much later the statue of a Virgin at St. Marien im Kapitol in Cologne. In a similar way the motifs of the second (the Quercia group) can be traced back; again we find it at Flor- ence in the sphere of Bernardo Daddi, in his triptych at the Bigallo of 1333. And again the motif goes finally back to Byzantine art, to the second type of the "Glykophilusa" as she is represented in a marble ikon at St. Marks at Venice where the child even grasps the headdress of the mother. In other words, the seemingly new and realistic motifs of the terracotta and stucco Virgins of the early XV century (both Florentine and Sienese) shows perhaps a new humanized atti- tude. But the "realistic" feeling on which this attitude is based and which has created the motifs is old: it has come to Italy from Byzantium and it has taken the way over those cities which have always been related to Byzantium, over Siena and Lucca (and probably also Pisa). Florence came in touch with it hardly before the middle of the XIV century. It is the route which we very often can trace when realistic motifs of the XIV and XV centuries are concerned; the seem- ingly realistic motif in many cases reveals itself as a Byzantine motif which is only developed on Italian soil, first in Siena and later in Florence. It is Byzantium that inspires the new art of the Italian Trecento and through it the Italian Renaissance. Whether Byzantium really created the new mo- tif in the XI century remains rather doubtful: we would not be astonished if one day also the "Glykophilusa" and with it the terracotta Madonnas of the early Quattro-centro in Flor- ence and Siena could be traced back from Byzantine art of the XI century to the Christian art of late antiquity. OLYMPUS IN HIGH ASIA (Continued from page 20) the indigenous gods does not satis- factorily account for its permanence. More logical explanation, probably, is the fact that Buddhism established a common denominator of form and dogma by interpreting in Buddhist terms theistic principles of which its own gods might well be avatars, in a The Best Art Buy of the Year!

Therefore, no surprise need be felt in finding above the Praga valley a Boro Budur-dedicated essentially to Buddha-which is close neighbor to the Brahmanic deities of Prambanam. It is interesting to recall that in the old Javanese Mahayanist text "Sang Hiang Kamahayanikan"-we are told that Siva is identical with Buddha, and this curious fusion of the Saiva and Buddhist cults is surely not unique in Buddhist annals. The geneses of the Gods of North- ern Buddhism must be followed along labyrinthine trails of speculation that often end in culs-de-sac. In attempt- ing to trace their origins, however, so much is encountered suggesting well- springs in common with very primi- tive theistic forms, that temptation arises to apply Dr. Elliott Smith's theory of culture-diffusion in a more narrow and direct sense to the field of human religious thought. The gods have undergone strange metamor- phoses, and Yama of the Northern Pantheon-cthonic genius of the Ma- hayana-whom Baron von Stael-Hol- stein believes was invoked in the Per- sian uplands some four millenia ago, may be paralleled in respect of com- fortable antiquity by Amitabha, Budd- ha of the glorious paradise of Suk- havati in the West, where "the daily suns hasten and disappear in all their glory." Amitabha, the Amida of Japan, was one of the earliest meta- physical creations of the Mahayana, and is a pervasive figure in the arts of both China and Japan. Space forbids more than mere mention of his spirit- ual reflex, the Bodhisattva Avalokites- vara-most beloved Bodhisat, perhaps, of the Northern pantheon. Known in Japan as Kwannon, this patronal deity of Tibet is made familiar in Chinese art as Kwan-yin-initially in mascu- line form and later as a feminine deity. Passing rapidly now is the Caval- cade of Northern Buddhism, and if we briefly glimpse familiar figures like Mafijusri, God of Transcendent Wis- dom, the Monju of Japan; Maitreya, the Coming Buddha; Tara, the con- sort of Avalokitesvara and all popu- lar in Tibet; 6r Bhaisajyaraja, who as Manla, God of Medicine became the Northern Aesculapius-all these dis- solve quickly in a phantasmagoria which is part and parcel of the Im- permanence proclaimed by the Buddha they typify.

The change in his drawings from the traditional re- finement of his early work to the bolder line and more daring compo- sitions of the advanced years is paral- leled in the large number of portraits in the current exhibition. The first canvases (Portrait of Achilles de Gas, Portrait of the Duke and Duchess of Morbilli) are restrained and elegant but in the later Portrait of Diego Martelli even the disordered character of the room is used to convey the sitter's personality. Because he refused to have his wax models cast, Degas is little known as a sculptor, though many of his same qualities are apparent when he creates in three dimensions.
