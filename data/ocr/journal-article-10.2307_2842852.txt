<plain_text><page sequence="1">75 KXFIIiISTAN and ITS PEOPLE. By Sir GEORGE SCOTT ROBERTSON, K.C.S.I. [WITH PLATES VII AND VIII.] IT may not be out of place to begin this paper by reminding you that Kafiristan is a country consisting of an intricate series of valleys, side ravines and gullies formed by spurs of the Hindu Kuish and their sub-divisions, which run down on the Indian side of that great westward continuation of the mighty mountain barrier separating India andl Afghanistan from the rest of Asia. The exact technical geographlical posi- tioni of this country need not corncern us here; the only point of chief imiportance, in that connection, is that Ka4firistan is a highland region, subject to snowfall and severe cold in the winter, while the heat of the summer months, tllough great, bears no resemblance to that stolkehold temperature which is common in India at an identical season of the year. You must please bear in mind, then, that this region is hidden away between Afghanistan, Chitral, Badakhshan, and the indepelndenit Khcanates north of Peshawer, and has nothing in common with the India you are accustomed to picture in imagination. In considering the manners and customs of Kafiristan, the inifluence of climate and of the physical characteristics of the country must not be forgotten, although the importance of these two factors in modifving, the habits of a people, need not be inlsisted upon further before suich an audience as this. Roughly speaking the climate of Kafiristan is temperate. The lieat does not exceed that of Italy in the summer, nor is the cold at mioderate elevations-say up to 7,000 feet-greater than that of some parts of Scotland in the winter. The rainfall is incoln- siderable; the arable lands depend mainly upon slnow water for their moisture. Irrigation, consequently, is necessary nearly everywhere. An almost complete absence of wind, in the deep narrow valleys, is the last peculiarity which need be now mentioned. I have decided to make a somlewhat unusual departure this evening, and to offer my information about Kafiristan in the form of a true story. That method seems to me best suited for the short time at my disposal. It will, I think, prove convenient to you also; perhaps more so than if I were to attempt to string together a series of bald dry facts upon a subject which is prac- tically unknown to many here to-night. My story will be illustrated at the end, but the pictures are intended, not so</page><page sequence="2">76 SIR G. S. ROBERTSON.-Kifiristan and its People. much to depict the actual scenes I am about to relate, as to give some general idea of environment and to amplify the narrative. Once upon a time in the little hospital for women which, as is the custom of all Kafir settlements, lies just outside the village of Kamdesh, Kazhirbri, the wife of Lutkam, of the DemidaIri clan of the Kam people, gave birth to a little son. Her age was only sixteein, although she had been married several years, and had long ago put aside the fillet which binds the locks of the girl for the headdress which is the national synmbol of womanhood. When she heard her child was a boy, her rapture was such that she becaine half unconscious, so well did she know, poor thing, the terrible lot of women in her country, neglected in childhood, overworked as field slaves wheni they grew older, and despised, badly fed and passively ill- treated all their lives, except for a few short days in early maturity when kind lhuman nature brightens with love even the moral and physical deoradation of a Kafir woman. Presentlv Kazhirbri roused herself a little, for the baby, wrapped in a fragment of half cured goatskin, was gently placed in her arms, and she knew that the ceremony of naming him was to take place. She hoped her boy nig,ht be called Merik, as that was the name of a youth she had dearly loved, but whom she never could have married, nor ever thought of marrying, for he be- longed to her mother's clan, and everybody knows a Kafir may not marry so near a relative any rnore than he may marry into his father's or his father's mother's clan. Kazhirbri remembered that one of her husband's ancestors had been known as Merik, so she almost held her breath as she strained her head to watch the baby's lips, w hen a wise old woman began rapidly to mumble over the child's forefathers in proper order. For that one mentioned by the reciter at the instant the suckling began to feed, would be the infant's name for life. Alas! Merik was mentioned and passed; the inifant commenced to drink when the word Lutkam was in the air, therefore he. became Lutkatm Lutkam, that is to say, Lutkaimi the son of Lutkam. After twenty-one days mother and child returned homie, the proper ceremonies having been duly observed. Kazhirbri was still weak, for she had been very ill. But the end of the year was approaching and the Indian corn crop still had to be carried, so very soon she was to be seen toiling along the steep inclines, the baby tucked into the front of her single tunic-like garment, and a huge load crushinig down her fragile body. Her husband was a kind-hearted man, but he had only one other wife at this time, and she was very old, so Kazhirbri had to work long before she was fit to do so, while he went to join his</page><page sequence="3">SIR G. S. IROBERTSON.-Kdfiristan atnzd its People. 77 partnier at the grazing grounds to bring back the flocks and herds from beyond a neighbouring pass before the snow canie. For otherwise they might fall an easy prey to a marauder, because lno others of the tribe would be nlear enough to help. Theni came the cold weather and the bad food, which alonie women get, only occasionally supplemented by the great public feasts given by rich mrien qualifying, in that curious way, for high social and religious rank in the tribe. So she never recovered her lost strength, but two years later, when small- pox was making its periodic devastation, killing or crippling children by the score,Kazhirbri also caught the disease aiid died. As I have said, her husband was by no means unkinid for a K4afir, so although he had noticed her long continued incapacity for hard work with something like resentment, yet as she was the mother of his only boy, that is to say, his only son1 who had liot slave blood in his veins, he had always refrained from active unkindness, nor had he ever thought of sellinig her. Indeed, while she lay ill, he did everything he thought might save her life. He sacrificed a cow to Imra anid distributed its flesh, he also lit a big, fire in the dying woman's room, where he invited a large company to dance to the music of a couple of squeaking pipes, played by neighbours, while slaves banged an accompani- ilient upon druLis. The guests shuffled and stamped till the sweat ran down their faces. Kaifirs are always in splendcid trainina, but the reek of that sick room tried even their sinewy fraimes. Yet nothing would appease the gods, and onle night the firing off of an old niusket told all who were interested in hei fate that Chandlu Kazhirbri, Lutkam istri, that is, Kazhirbri, the daughter of Chandlu, the wife of Lutkaim, was no more. Lutkaim thereupon gave a feast, which is still remembered for the quality of the wine lhanded round. Everybody came, high and lowly, as the dorlor was universally respected for his birth, his wealth and for the number of eneinies he had slain. Dead Kazhirbri, her thini waxen features just discernible amongst the gaudy shawls which covered the body, was raised on her bed, from tiine to time, while, to the sound of music, relatives and friends danced round the corpse, some in tears and with grief- colivulsed features, but many slmiling aind happy. In the initervals orators extolled her family and her husband's an- cestors, while her toothless old mother crooned lamentations intermittently. Lutkaim, the son, was too small to feel his loss. He no longer was carried daily to the fields nor did he trot honme over the steep hillsides, steadying his baby footsteps by frequent grabs at the red edge at the bottom of his mnother's skirt, which is at a height convenient for the hand of a two-year-old chil(l. But</page><page sequence="4">78 SIR G. S. ROBERTSON.-Kdfiristanl and its People. he was now the delighl-t of his father, wlho lnever tired of carrying him about, or showing off or playing with the mannikin. It was am-lusing to see the way the nman was tyrannised over bv his pigmy son, who always got his way in the enld. Once for ilnstance, he insisted upon goilng too lnear Imra's shrine, where children are not allowed. The father got angry because a sacrifice was being made in the presence of a large congre- gation; he even cuffed the boy to drive him back. Speechless with anger and surprise, the little fellow stamped and raged until his repentant sire gave in, and let hinm go where he liked, before sobbing himself to sleep between the parental kniees. All the bystanders, and even the great priest hinmself, murmiured-, somiiewhat dubiously, that Imra would never ninld such a tiny child as that approaching his holy place. Gradually the fat little limbs hardened, and the small framne grew sturdy and healtlhy, so that, except for a little ophthalmia and a slight eruption of the shaved head, Lutkam the younger became as pleasant to look upon as an average English boy. With the growth of the body the milnd also expanded; his surroundings educated hinm. At first he shrieked at the sight of the great wooden effigies under the shed-the village Wal- halla-aid even wheni his own mother's inm,ge was erected a year after her death, although he enjoyed the fun of the dalncing anid the feasts, and ever afterwards felt proud of the size anad magnificence of the statue-because it indicated the grlandeur of his family-still for a long time he dreaded the glare of the round eyes made of white stonies. Next, he learned to merely wonder at the grotesque objects, and to play abouit them without concern; finally, he came to despise all, except a very few of his own ancestral nmonuments, and even to throw stones at them. Until the age of elev-en Lutkam's dress was a simple goat- skin and niothing muore. His pursuits consisted mainly of long absences with his father at the pasture lands, where dairy pro- dutice, which constituted the wealth, or at aniy rate the income, of the family, had to be looked after. In the winter, wheni the flocks were brought nearer home, much of the boy's time was spent in the village, where he gradually developed in skill anld strength until a stone shooter and toy weapons were re- placed bv a good strong bow with a sheath of iron-tipped arrows. When his father's blacksmith slave forged him a dagger, Lutkam knew the delights of manhood. Henceforward darkness hadl nio terrors for him; with daogger on belt he could wander any- where at night, for Yush, the evil one, who lurks in roclks to seize hapless travellers, has no power against a KIafir wearing, the nationlal weaponi.</page><page sequence="5">SIR G. S. ROBERTSON.-K4firzistan anzd its People. 79 In this same year three importanit events occurred. Lutkam became entitled to wear the clothes of a man, he went on his first raid, and his father was killed in circumstances I shall relate to you. A friend who was passing through the compli- cated ceremonies compulsory for all who desire to be "jast" (or headmen) allowed Lutkam to participate in that part wlicih qualifies boys to put on trousers, so his forehead and shinls were smeared with blood and he was acknowledged a man. Often, while tending goats and cattle, his father or the servanits had been obliged to be on the defensive against marauders; he had also seen one or two very loose hill skir- mis'les in the grey of the morning, and once all had to fly for their lives from Pathans who were following Lutkam's uncle to get venigeance for a midnight murder in their village; but times had changed of late years, strongo kings ruled in Afghani- stan and in Chitral, and Lutkam had never seen a man slaini. Shortly after he attained manihood, as above described, durinq a sacrifice to the war god, Glsh, the wild under-priest, who used to get temporary inspiration at such times, suddenly declared the god demanded more offerings, and had given the single manldate "Attack !" The tribal elders at once met in excited conclave to debate this subject. As all tried to argue, to declaim at the same time, the outcry was great. Only occasionally was there a lull when the stentorian tones of the high priest vanquished and stilled, for the instant, all other voices. It was finally agreed that the god's orders must be obeyed, and that a neighbouring KaKfir tribe should be raided, as it was obviously out of the question to assault Afghanistan or Chitradl, while in the valley specified there was good pros- pect of plunder. No soonier was this decisioin ma(le kniowin than every miiale rushed for his arms, messengers were sent hot foot to all the other tribal villages, and in an incredibly slhort time the fighting meen had assembled and started. The female augurs of Badamuik (leclared the omens propitious, so the expedition left in happ) conlsciousuess of supernatural approval. All the women left the fields, donned every bit of finery t'ley owned, or could borrow, to dance incessantly day and night to the gods, in order that the tribe might get much loot and the men conme back uninjured. Many branidished daggers or axes. At midnight or very early mornilng, the fitful blaze of a bonfire flashed now and again upon gleamingr steel, or illuminated, for an instant, horned head-dresses, and strange clad sombre filures, bowved with weari- ness, but moving with fantastic energy; female voices, tired, but shrilly discordanit, added to the feeble drum tap of a slave boy,</page><page sequence="6">80 SIR G. S. ROBERTSON.-Kdfiristan and its People. were the only sounds as this Walpurgis witch throng flickered otut of the heavy darkness to be at once reabsorbed ilnto it. It was only by extreme celerity that the warriors could effect a surprise. They numbered 480, of whom Lutkam was almost the youngest. A wilder-looking party it would be hard to conceive. About one-fourth carried old matchlocks. All had bows and arrows and daggers, a few possessed spears, there were not more than half a dozen shields altogether, and not a single sword was to be seen. Most of the men wore nothing but goat- skins-the hairy side out. These garments were confined at the waist by a leather strap, dotted with iron studs, which besides the dagger, supported small leather pouches, or narrow wooden tubes, strunig together like pan-pipes, for carrying gunpowder or articles of no size. A few individuals of the richer class had coarse cotton shirts and short wide trousers of the same stuff, a dozen or so had Shmn caps on their heads and Chitrali or Minjaini robes wrapped round them. but tucked up at the waist so as not to impede the knees in walking. No order was maintained. The advance was led by light-linmbed young braves, with one or two of graver years, whose words were ever listened to witl respect, for these men had terrible records, and one was covered with the scars of wounds. The swift noiseless step of the quick-moving Kafirs was strange to see; they moved as fast and silently as disembodied spirits, but their keen restless eyes, the frowning, faces, the side to side head jerks, showed the colncen- tration of their minds, and the eagerness with which they were searching, the hill sides. They hurried along in single file, for the track was narrow. At a short interval came the mail body with whom was Lutkam, and quite in the rear certain old men toiled along with one or two cripples whose physical infirmities conmpelled them to lao behind. For a boy Lutkamn was a splendid walker, but he soon began to pant till lhe thought his breast would burst, and his shin-bones became like red hot iron bars. For hours the march continued, along the face of terrible cliffs, througlh streams, or rarely over single pole bridges, and seldom across level ground for more than a few yards. Two hiah passes had to be climbed. At the second, poor little Liit- kanm fell down and was for some miniutes unlconlscious, but he was hurried, encouraged or scolded by his father, and at length, without anything which could properly be called a halt, the Arnzhi country was reached. The surprise was complete, the few Wai IKafirs abouit fled at once and an enormous booty in cattle and goats was collected. One or two shots were fired and all seemiied over. Ardent younig men wanted</page><page sequence="7">SIR G. S. ROBERTSON.-KEdfiristan and its People. 81 to start btck forthwith to he home first with the good news, but older hands looked anixious; they warned all to drive off the animals quickly ancl to keep toaether. Indeed, time was scarcely allowed to eat the thick cakes of bread or cheese, or the dried refuLse of the wine presses. Such food was hastily dragged from small goatskin bags or from the receptacle formed by pouching up the body garment above the belt; it was swallowed rapidly while the eaters rani about and urged the animals forward. But soon shots fell near, and the enemy reinforced to his full strength, was upon them. Numbers were on the side of the raiders, but the Amzlii people were mlad at the idea of losing their property. Tlley raced along, high up the steep inclines, to charge down upon the front or sides of the convoy with the courage of desperation. Hand to hand fightinig with daggers was occurrinig intermittently all along the line. Furious as were the Amzlii, the captors raged at the tliouaht of losing what they had wonl, and fought like Glsh himself. The two Lutkams were at the tail of the convoy with a large group of fellow tribesmen. As they crossed a spot where the narrow track broadened into a small level space, formed by a little bay in the hills, with the river as the chord of the arc, a strong band of the enemy flashed down the slope and fell upon them with a wild outcry. Lu:tkam, the boy, knew hardly anything of what then happened, for a gun fired close to his ear deafened him, and he stood paralysed with fear. There was a flash of weapons, a gleam of passionate faces witlh staring eyes, much swaying to and fro, and then it was all over. Hardly a minute could have passed, but the boy's father was lying on the ground, limp and still, with three others. Poor Lutkam could not stir, h-e could only gaze fixedly. He saw a friend rapidly cut off his father's head and bear it away, someone dragged him by the arm, he was pushed and pulled; thell the whole rear-gulard wvent on again. At this point memory stopped; he incdeed half remembers other short furious incidents, but perhaps they were dreams. He recollects how he arrived at his village and how all the women came out in tears, with great lamentatiolns, to meet them. Theni he slept. When he awoke, at least one day had passed, his legs ached with stiffness, one of his miothers (that is, one of his father's wives) gave him food, whereupon he fell asleep again. After the funleral rites, which included the fixing of a straw man to the severed head, aild much pomp and magnificence in the shape of gorgeous raiment for the lay figure, enormous public banquets, and interminable dances and orations, the poor frag- ment of humanity was carried to the above-ground cemetery, to be dleposited in the fainily coffer with vessels containing food VOL. XXVII. G</page><page sequence="8">82 SIR G. S. ROBERTSON.-Kdfirgistan and its People. for the sustenance of the dead man's ghost. Then the dancing began all over again round a stuffed figure strapped on a bed, for otherwise it would have falleni to the ground many times as it was energetically jumped up and down or whirled about by great warriors, who outvied one another in showing honour tc the dead Lutkamin in this national manner. At length all the celebrations were ended and the last old woman had finished mumbling the dead man's pedigrees, in colnventional sorrow, so Lutka6m the son returned to the ordinary work of life-for a year at any rate. Then the wooden effigy would have to be erected with lavish entertainments. Being young he soon forgot his troubles. It was consoling to stroll about in a dignified way, with anl old goatskin thrown over his cotton clothes as a mourning garmnelnt, and to receive the sympathy of the people. Much pleasure was also to be found in leading conversation to the recent obsequies of his father and to mentioni, casually as it were, what enormous cost had already been incurred, and then to guess at what the effigy feasts would mean in the way of expenditure. He was not yet twelve years old, so his uncle (father's brother) took charge of all affairs. This old gentleman was reverenced in the tribe because of the wonderful number of people he had slain; he now added to the popularity, thus obtained, by distributing his nephew's goods, with a bountiful hand, under tlhe guise of paying adequate respect to the dead. The boy did not mind; he knew he was still one of the wealthiest of the tribe, for his father had been a skinflint, as well as a dauntless blackmailer all along the frontier, not to speak of his great accomplishments as a thief. He had never been lazy or careless when there was a chance, however remote, to get plunder or to steal, while he would sometimes go near to starving himself and his family in order to save. As a result, there were immense flocks and herds, anid the rarest cotton velvet robes, as well as gorgeous slham brocades fron Peshawer, to be found in the rooms between the living apart- ments above ancl the cow stables on the ground floor, stored away in those great boxes which are used indifferently as recep- tacles for movable property or as coffins for the dead. Lutkam now begani to develop hereditary traits of avarice and cupidity; his soft boyish features had an odd mixture of childishness and business cunning. Of the four widows left by his father, Lutkam married olne, thus becoming his own step- parent, so to speak, wlhile his uncle took over the rest with the general management of the land. Lutkam's bride was three times older than himself, but a boy must of course have some woman to slave for himn.</page><page sequence="9">SIR G. S. ROBERTSON.-K6firistan and its People. 83 A year later a prime event occurred. Some Mussulmans were travelling in the country under a doubtful permiiit. They were very brave or reckless men, bent on trade. Various Kafirs had received bribes from them, and had then gone away, but as no one uttered objections of any kind the mierchants concluded all was right, or with Eastern fatalism determined to run the risk in the hope of big profits. One day before the party was expected at Kamdesh, five youlng men of good family started down the hill for a narrow level space of ground by the river's edge where certain overhangilng rocks commanded the main path and afforded an excellent hiding place. Lutkam was taken also. Concealed in such a way that they could carefully watch the track by the water, the little company lay in wait all night and many hours afterwards. Villagers con- stantly passed by but did not see, perhaps did not care to see, what was going on. At length the traders appeared, one behilnd the other, four panting under loads, the fifth without a burden, as he was unwell. Devoid of suspicion they reached the place of ambush, whereupon the Kafirs fired with steady aim, the matchlocks rested on the rocks. Although the range was lnot 20 yards, and altlhough each marksmen had had a particular Mussulman assigned to him, only two men were killed, and a third wounded. Springing down from their hidden position the Kafirs quickly slew both the Mussulman that was hurt and the other who had escaped the bullets altogether, but the sickly youth was a few yards behilnd his friends. He stood for an instant, as if turned to stolne, then he leapt back and fled like the wind. But no powers of speed could enable a fugitive to escape thus in Kaifiristani. This boy, for he was scarcely more than a boy, blundered off the right track, ran under a bluff, to find himself brought up at a precipice; he doubled, merely to fall into the arms of two pursuers who shouted over their shoulders to Lutkam, close behind them, "0 Lutkaim, strike! strike!" Lutkam came up, drew his dagger, hesitated a second-and strLick. This proceeding was admitted to be a duibious one, so there was no dancing to the war god. Reticence was maintained oIn the subject, and the incident itself came to be stoutly denied by all concerned in it, who found sufficient reward in the merchani- dise they obtained even after important lheadnmen had been propitiated by gifts lest they should deniounce the affair. Far different was alnother exploit, a year or eighteen montlhs afterwards, when Lutkadm and his friends killed at night, as they slept, three tribal enemies in the middle of their owIn village in the KIunar Valley. That enterprise was hazardous, G 2</page><page sequence="10">84 SiR G. S. ROBERTSON.-K6filistan and its People. for the Kafirs crept right in amongst the foe, therefore the least bungling with the dagger would have meant their certaii destruction. As it was, they managed to sever the ears of the victims, and to bring, away a turban cloth as well. Kamdesl was reached in the evening, so they bad to stop outside the village all night, in accordance with custom. Time passed easily, for troops of friends came to admire and conaratulate, food also was brought and splendid raiment for the next dav's functions. All was cheery, and the heroes occasionally stood up to sing the song of triumph and thanksgiving As the rather melancholy notes floated over the silent houses, every one knew that not only had Mussulma'n enemies been slain but that the tribe had suffered no loss. Early in the imorniing, decked out in finery, carrying orna- mental axes, the young braves marched to the dancing house with all the women of their families, who were bright with washed faces and radiant with enthusiasm. Each female carried a small wicker basket full of wheat. The heroes deposited the turban cloth on the ground in frolnt of the rough stone altar, and with the wom-ien stringing out behind in a seirmicircle, shuffled and stamped in the most approved style. When there was a pause, to recover breath, the women showered wheat grainis over the young men. It was a purely domestic affair, and miiembers of other famnilies passed by witl scarcely a glance at the happy performers. By the time he was sixteen Lutkam had become one of the most sup-sap manji (cunining rascals) in the tribe. Not that he was a bad boy. Far from it. According to his lights he was an admirable youth. He never offended public opinion, and even his sale to Mussulman traders of his two half-sisters (daughters of a slave mother) for robes, gunpowder, sham jewellery and goats, was much applauded by his tribe and kinsfolk, for it proved that he was a good trader, a keen bargainer. As a matter of fact, the Muhammedans knew perfectly well they were paying an exorbitant price for the girls; but they were glad to get them, at any cost, for the double advantage of obtainingr female slaves and at the same time converting, Kafirs to Isla'n. About this time Lutkam fell seriously in love with a young woman of his own ace, who oriainally lived in the Dungal Valley. But her home had beemi burnt, and she, with her family, forced to fly over the mountain ridge to the souith of Kamdesh. In former days to colnciliate the Muhammedalls, tlleir lnear neig,hbours, the Dunaal people clothed their women after the Nursut fashion, that is, in dark blue trousers which hung in voluminous festooned folds, a long over-skirt of the same colour</page><page sequence="11">SIR G. S. IROBERTSON.-K4firistan and its People. 85 and a similarly tinted skull cap which covered long plaited locks. In this garb-which fromi motives of economy she still retained-adorned with white metal ornaments, Lutkam's fianc&amp;e looked a really pretty girl. Subsequent to their marriage, he and she, for a week or so, were so desperately in love that they mrade an amusing and interesting couple. I frequently at that time saw them seated together at a top verandah window. They were always laug,hing softly and every instant glanced at one another, perfectly oblivious of the rest of the world. Of course he could not be seen walkina about accompaniied by hiis wife, so wheni lhe wenit abroad Lut- kadi consoled himself with the society of his brother-in-law. After about a month of connubial lhappiniess he quarrelled in a mild way with his wife's brother and left her to go hunting. Thereafter she was like any other KaKfir's wife, a mere slave to her lord. On the frontier, Lutkaim blackmailed, stole, raided, and occasionally mnurdered. At home he gave huoge feasts, bore him- self well in quarrels, made love and danced with energy, and tiled to swindle everyone of his acquaintance. Indeed, his sole fault was that he was an indifferent public speaker. In time lhe attained the rank of " jast," or elder of the tribe, and every- one said with a wise shake of the head, " Wheni he is older Lutkam Lutkanm will be a very big mani." Finally, when the Amir of Afghanistan advanced his claim to Kafiristan, Lutkam fell upon evil days. Many of his relatives were on the side of the Amir; indeed it was through Kafir partizans that the Afgclhanis conquered tlhe lower part of the Bashgul valley, where- upon the tribes of the upper portion saw the uselessness of fur- ther resistance. Lutkam thought the matter over for weeks, even imiouths, beforehand. He trimmed, lied and doubled in a way reinarkable evein for a Kafilr; but in the end he was wrong. All his flocks were seized and he is now a refugee in Chitral, where, at the instance of the Government of India, he has been pro- vided with land and is fairly content. He is a typical Kafir of the well-born class. He has always been a good friend of mine, and on more that one occasion has given mie much help. I also have been able to do something for him in return. I yet hope to see him again for he is still young, so perhaps some day we shall meet and I shall again watch him dance or swagger, lhear him lie cheerfully, and find hiim in the future as in the past, an amusing companion, a capital talker, and a trustworthy friend. Before showing you the lantern slides, I wislh to make two or three renmarks concernino them. I wish particularly to say that they are of real scientific value. In Kaifiristan I took a very</page><page sequence="12">86 SIR G. S. ROBERTSON.-K4firistan and its People. large number of photographs. I also brought away with me specimens of clothing, weapolns, household utensils, musical instruments, etc. It is especially from my photographs that Mr. McCormick has drawn the pictures, which I hope you will agree with me are clever and beautiful. To give you some idea of how they were done, I may mnention that the drawing of the womeen daincing, the last of the series, was carefully constructed from about five and twenty of my photographs-snap shot photo- graphs with a kodak. One or two of the slides have been made direct fromu my photographs-they consequently will appear less clear thani those which have gone through the intermediate process of being drawn in black and white by Mr. McCormnick. Mr. Simpson has taken great trouble in makino these slides from Mr. McCormick's drawings, and I feel greatly indebted to him for his work. Mr. WILLIAM CROOKE, after remarking on the interesting paper communicated by Sir George Robertson, suggested that it might, with advantage, include more detailed information on the popular religion and folklore of a people who stand as it were on the watershed of two faiths. That they have been to some extent affected by Indian influence is clear from their adoption from that source of the fairy known as the Yech, who represents the Yaksha of Hindu mythology, the attendanrt on Kuvera, the god of wealth. It would also be ilnteresting to work out the extent to which they have beenl affected by Greek influence, which was obvious in some of the exhibits laid before the meeting. Mr. J. F. COLLINGWOOD wished to ask a purely ethniological question. He understood that Sir George Robertson spoke of Tatars as the inihabitants of tlle region described. It seemed to him, the speaker, that most of the photographs exhibited indicated a semitic facies; but there was one especially of two young men which showed unmistakably Mongolian origiin. Could the author inform the members as to the proportions of the racial mixture in those people? Dr. LEITNER: I did not expect the treat that we have all enjoyed in having Kafir life and customs portrayed in the shape of a charming story-an admirable precedent that readers of papers on little known tribes would do well to follow. What I expected from the notice were such additions to the Anthro- pology of the Kaifirs as " measurements," for, althouglh those of the Dards and Kafirs, who are ethnically kindred races, that I now hand in to the able lecturer, and to this learned Society for publication in its Journial, are olnly those of twelve persoins,</page><page sequence="13">SIR G. S. ROBERTSON.-K6firistan and its People. 87 though typical of eight tribes, more are wanted, and would be hailed with special satisfaction by the Anthropological Institute. Indeed, it miay be said that the subject of the Kaifirs is one which this Institute has peculiarly made its own, and .its late President especially, Dr. Beddoe, examined the Kafir Jamsh6d, a nephew of the famous General Feramory, whom I brought home in 1872, with an anthropological minuteness that will ever be an exanmple to the students of our science. Several of you may remember the narrative which he gave of his adven- tures in the Amir's service, and the appeal he made on behalf of his fellow Kafirs then already threatened by Afghan extirpa- tion, enslavement, and displacement. I can only add that his account of Badakhshian, to which he lent an Afghan battery as a Major of Artillery, was the first, as it is still the fullest and truest account of that country that we possess. What he then predicted has come true, and in spite of the efforts of learned and philanthropic Societies, in which your President took a worthy part, the Kaifirs, as a nation, exist no lonlger. The vestiges of Greek art, of which the tripod in Sir G. Robertson's most interesting collection here exhibited, as well as the dagger, oil-lamp and footgear, which I have now brought, bear witness, are being mnore and more obliterated; the picturesque multitude of gods or deified ancestors, whose equestrian effigies in a country where horses are practically unknown,show an antiquity of Centaurs, will be submerged in the monotony of Mahomme- danism, although the national dances, of which Dr. Robertson has described some, will linger on, and vestiges of their Bacchic hymns, to which Col. Holdieb has alluded, and their dialects, which I have been studying, will, as also perhaps the inscriptions int an archaic Greek character referred to by Mr. Senost, may yet recall, for a time, the ancient colony said to have been founded by Dionysus at Nyssa, and rediscovered, as compatriots, by Alexander's troops. Increased by Hiram refugees from the south, Buddhist emigrants from ancient Kabul and Kandahar, and Zoroastrians from Balkh, the ancient Bactria-all from Mussulman persecution, the Kaifirs have resisted encroachments by Afghans and Pathans for 1,000 years, at last to fall before modern weapons of destruction. On the confines of Kafiristan, diseases and many vices had before been introduced by their neighbours, and the Bashgalis were compelled by the Mehters of Chitral to raid certain travellers. Otherwise, they ever pos- sessed the splendid courage, the domestic affections and the classical beauty to which Sir George also bears his valuable testimony. Indeed, in their joviality, love of money, drink, fun and sport, fear of public opinion and endless discussions in their local parliaments, they rather bear resemblance to their</page><page sequence="14">88 Sir, G. S. IhOBEITSON.-I4fJi'idant cand its People. Einglish "brethren." They are certainly neither Semitic nor Turasian, as one or othier of the speakers-certainily not Sir George-may appear to think. They are not eveln a branch of the Iranian subdivision of the Aryan family, but practically pure Aryans with a strong basis of Archaic Greek. Tlhe "Yatsh," to whom allusion lhas been made, are not the "Yuechi," or white HIIrs, but the " Yakshas," or the attendanits on the Indian Plutus, Kuvera, the god of wealth; beings sometimes good and at other times evil, and forming a charming antithesis to their fairies. Mr. Clodd, for one, would greatly appreciate their folklore and that of the Dards, and an example of the anthropomorphic tendency of the Kafirs is their expostulation, when dying, on the Lughman side, " You may punishl me, oh Deity, but I have elnjoyed nmyself." (Cheers.) Mr. READ alluded to the interest of any authentic records of such an interesting district as the Hlindu-iiush, w-vhich, lying on the borders of so inany different races, would from its physical character naturally preserve ancient customs and traditions likely to disappear in tlhe more frequented tracks. Thus one might expect to find among, the Kadfirs traces of ancient civilisa- tions like those of Persia, India, or Bactria, the latter art carry- ing with it an infusion of Greek culture. Any one familiar with the Lycian tomabs brouglht home by Sir Charles Fellows,' and now in the British Museum, would at once see a strong resemblance between them and the Temple of the goddess Dizane. Such a resemblance might perhaps be a coincidence, but we find it somewhat conifirmed by the shape of the tripod b)owl used by the Diviner,2 which would seem to be idelntical with classical objects of the same kind. Description of Plates. PLATE YIT. Fig. 1. Dancing Axe (KAZHA) used by RAMGUL Kafirs, shaft of wood, spiral ornament and knob at top made of brass, as is also the blade, used exclusively for ornamental and ceremoniial purposes. Fig. 2.
