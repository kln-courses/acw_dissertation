<plain_text><page sequence="1">Aowin Terracotta Sculpture PATRICIA CRANE CORONEL The Aowin are an Akan people who live in the Western Region of Ghana. They inhabit approximately thirty vil- lages, with a total population of 30,000, from the Bia River in the north to the junction of the Tano and Boin rivers in the south, and from the Ivory Coast border in the west to the Wassa Traditional Area in the east. Their capital is the town of Enchi, where the present paramount chief (omanhene), Nana Boafo Ntaa II, has reigned since 1969. The death of an Aowin chief or another prominent person was-at some time in the past-usually accompanied by a tra- dition of a clay portrait of the deceased, either alone or with his court, as a monument to both him and his office. Posthumous terracotta sculpture was a widespread artistic tradition prior to the twentieth century among many Akan peoples throughout southern Ghana and southeastern Ivory Coast.1 Early ac- counts confirm the fact that funerary art and associated rituals were established along the coast by the end of the seventeenth century (Bosman 1907 [1705]:232). Akan funerary figures and pots generally were placed near the cemetery, but not on the grave itself, in an area that was designated as sacred. The Aowin called their funerary ter- racotta sculpture mma, which translates simply as "figure." The mma of generations of rulers accompanied by their court members could inhabit one sacred resting place, or mmaso, where annual libations, offerings and prayers would be given to the ancestors at the beginning of the Aowin new year (January/February). Terracotta sculpture from five Aowin mmaso have been iden- tified since 1967. These sites are: 1) Yoyo, uncovered in 1967 by the African Timber and Plywood Company; 2) Nkwanta, which I visited in 1972 (R. Sieber reported viewing heads in Enchi in 1967 [1973:76], but these were no longer in Enchi in 1972); 3) Abokyia/Achimfu, which was reported but not visited in 1967 by Sieber (1973:76) and which I saw in 1972; 4) Dis- sueano, which I visited shortly after it had been uncovered in 1972; 5) Jema, whose single remaining head I saw in 1972. I conducted a field study of the Aowin funerary tradition from October 1972 to May 1973, with follow-up field research dur- ing the summer of 1974.2 The information collected indicates that the Aowin, as well as the people who inhabited this area prior to their arrival in the early eighteenth century, were prolific terracotta makers. The remaining fragments show evidence of both standing and seated full figures with accompanying regalia-swords, crowns, stools and jewelry. While the production of funerary sculpture in this region ceased around the turn of this century, 2 HEAD, 14cm. DE GRUNNE COLLECTION 1. HEAD, 24cm.

The Aowin people and their history and art have not been studied and re- corded. Because of this lack of written information, the terracotta finds from each of the five areas are described and discussed here, whenever possible, in light of accompanying oral history. Yoyo The existence of Aowin funerary ter- racottas became known in 1967 when the African Timber and Plywood Company discovered a deserted terracotta site dur- ing log-extracting operations. Fragments of figures and pots were discovered near an old gold pit toward the bottom of a 245-meter hill in the Yoyo Forest. Selected samples were donated to the British Museum and the National Mu- seum of Ghana, where they remain today under the label of Samreboi, the village in which the company is located.3 For accuracy and consistency, this paper will refer to terracotta salvaged from this site as Yoyo. The original feeder roads leading to this site are now overgrown. Informa- tion collected while the site was accessi- ble is scanty, leaving little on which to date the Yoyo finds. One large, undeco- rated bowl (25 cm. x 31 cm.), however, was retrieved from the roots at the very base of a tree estimated to be over a hun- dred years old. Confirmation that the site had been abandoned for this length of time came from the inhabitants of the closest village, Adeikrom, at the bottom of the hill. When asked about the site in 1967, the people of this village said they were told (by their ancestors) of "the people before them who lived on the hill," but they knew nothing of the ter- racotta site except its funerary nature. All of the figures from this mmaso were in a damaged condition; the figures were broken at the neck, and accompanying body fragments suggest that the heads were once part of complete figures and not busts or pot lids. Fragments of pot- tery sword blades, hilts (some with hands attached) and modeled necklaces indicate that the mma were depicted in courtly regalia. Only four complete bowls were sal- vaged, and none shows evidence of zoomorphic or anthropomorphic de- signs. The decoration on the bowls and bowl fragments was limited to incised geometric designs based on the circle and semicircle motif. Ten heads from Yoyo are in the Na- tional Museum of Ghana. They range in quality from amorphous, solid clay heads with simplified, pinched-slit fea- tures to professionally modeled, natural- istic portraits. One of the finest examples 3. HEAD, 18cm. NKWANTA SITE. (Fig. 5) is representative of a style found also at the mmasos at Nkwanta, Jema and Abokyia/Achimfu. This naturalistic style is typically hollow, 10-20 centimeters from chin to crown, with modeled oval eyes, incised or inset pupils, a broad forehead and a slightly parted, upturned mouth. There is less geometric clarity of facial features in Figure 6. It shows a subtle indication of the underlying bone struc- ture with a less emphasized brow line, inset stone eyeballs and parted, fleshy lips. The incised parallel lines beside the ears and on the cheeks4 are one type of facial marking common to the naturalis- tic Aowin heads displaying marks. Other types found on these heads are multiple, raised, parallel lines on the cheek coupled with three joined, notched marks in relief diagonally below the eye and four to five notched and joined marks in relief above each eye- brow; these are accompanied by either three horizontal lines of similar marks along the ears (Fig. 3) or a single vertical row to the outside of each eye (Fig 7). Nkwanta The fragments remaining at the Nkwanta mmaso are arranged in a pat- tern that may be reminiscent of the origi- nal order. An accompanying legend serves as an example of the ancestral his- tory associated with an Aowin mmaso. The story explains that upon migrating to this area, the Aowin leader, Ano Asima, met the ruler of the existing Anyi inhabitants, a woman called Nana At- tabra, who lived in Nkwanta. Her sub- sequent marriage to Ano Asima joined their two peoples. Stories recounting her life eventually elevated her to legendary 4. HEAD ON STOOL TOP, 27cm NKWANTA SITE. status as a chief who "came alone, died and vanished without being buried." The Nkwanta terracotta funerary site is claimed by the village inhabitants to be that of Nana Attabra, created by an Anyi woman artist under the order of Nana Attabra prior to her death. The site's im- portance requires the supervision of a priestess, who at the beginning of each new year washes the figures and offers libations to the gods while asking a sim- ple prayer for protection: "They [the gods] made them before we came. We ask to be looked over while we stay, until we too leave." The head identified by the presiding priestess as that of Nana Attabra rests on the seat of a solid clay stool (Fig. 4). The figures that once surrounded her, now but fragments, are described as seven members of her court, including her daughter, Afukwa (Fig. 3), who suc- ceeded her mother as chief; a slave; the queenmother, the matriarchal head of the ruling family; a court member; an elder; and a hunter stalking an elephant with the help of his servant, who signals with raised arm when the elephant is spotted. Of these statues, the only dis- cernible fragments are three heads, a clay stool top, four torsos, an arm, hand and a neck. The three remaining heads, though in a blemished state, are of the same naturalistic style as Figure 5 from Yoyo. The hollow head of Nana Attabra (Fig. 4) was modeled in life-size proportions, but it is difficult to estimate the original form or size of the full sculpture since the 30</page><page sequence="4">head is now placed on a broken clay stool with its neck planted in the ground. It may have been a full figure sitting in state on a ceremonial stool, considering the hollow, cylindrical torsos at the site, which are 25-64 centimeters in height and similar to those from Abokyia/ Achimfu (Fig. 12). The head that remains is elegant, with a uniform, tufted coiffure and a subtle smile. Recessed oval eyes with round, raised eyeballs create a gaze that is at once vacant and all-seeing. A smooth, broad forehead reveals the only remaining facial marks-four pinched clay relief marks placed horizontally above and vertically beside each eye. The lips appear to have been originally slightly parted, upturned and lacking the fullness of those realistically ren- dered. On the other hand, the head of Nana Attabra is more life-like both in propor- tions and modeling than the head of her daughter (Fig. 3). The latter demon- strates the geometric conventionaliza- tion of facial features prevalent in Aowin naturalism: a long oval face with a low, broad, sharply receding forehead; small oval eyes closely set; a broad nose with flared nostrils; and a small, slightly open mouth. Evidently there were originally four horizontally connected pinched marks raised above the outside of each eye and three to five horizontal bands of six joined marks beside each ear. The coiffure, now almost completely mis- sing, seems not to have been of knotted tufts but of plaited patterns. Breakage surfaces on both heads indicate that coif- fure pieces and facial marks were added after the initial modeling, though of course before the head was fired. Abokyia/Achimfu The greatest quantity of Aowin ter- racotta pieces was found at a site located between the towns of Abokyia and Achimfu. What was at one time probably twenty or more figures is now a pile of broken figures and bowls. A libation is offered each new year as a token gesture to the old tradition, but no care is taken to preserve the site or to pass on the ancestral history associated with each figure. The chief of Abokyia in 1972, Abirimoro III, claimed ownership of the site, explaining that mmaso would nor- mally be closer to the village, and this one was close to their previous village of Abataso, now abandoned. Apparently there is no memory of an mma made dur- ing the lifetime of an Abokyia inhabitant. Three heads from this site, ranging in height from 23 to 28 centimeters, are of the naturalistic style found at Yoyo and Nkwanta. One head (Fig. 7), with the same facial marks as those on Figure 4 from Nkwanta, also has a slit under the chin and a hole at either side of the mouth as well as one centered below the lower lip. A similar example was found at the Yoyo site and is presently in the collection of the National Museum of Ghana. Aowin elders who knew of their funerary terracotta tradition considered these holes to be for the insertion of hair, which seems logical. Two terracotta heads now in the de Grunne collection in Belgium (Figs. 1, 2) can also be attributed to the Aowin as examples of the natu- ralistic style. A more prevalent but equally consis- tent style is found among the remaining heads at Abokyia/Achimfu. These are characteristically 10-18 centimeters from crown to chin, with pinched-slit features and a multipatterned coiffure often in- cluding sculptural extensions (Figs. 13, 14). The head is wide, with a receding forehead, and the eyes and mouth are represented as swollen protuberances divided by a narrow slit. Individualiza- tion, as in the naturalistic style, was seemingly accomplished through depic- tion of facial markings and hair or head- dress designs. The most consistent mark on these heads is a group of three or more raised ridges on either cheek below the eyes. A horizontal line of ridges (Fig. 14) or a "crow's feet" arrangement of raised lines (Fig. 13)5 sometimes appears between the eyes and ears. Intricate headdresses are typical of heads in this style. Coiffures are usually symmetrical and incorporate various sculptural de- signs; antenna-like extensions are com- bined with other plaited patterns com- posed of concave balls, coils, ridges and knots. Other heads from this site are dispa- rate in style. Some exhibit transitional qualities in which an artist attempted naturalism by recessing modeled eyes under the forehead, only to create reces- sed square planes. In another, more sub- tle anomaly, the eyes are neither pinched slits nor modeled eyeballs but delicately incised almond shapes beneath slightly raised eyebrows (Fig. 8). The nose is mis- sing, as is most of the coiffure; however, the hair patterns apparently accentuated a pointed head. A fragment of one anthropomorphic pot (Fig. 9) and five nonrepresentational pots were the only identifiable contain- ers at the site. The former is one of the more intriguing mma at AbokyialAchim- fu. The neck and the very base of the pot are missing, but the remaining fragment shows that the artist modeled a face and then surrounded the bowl with a coiffure of flattened, indented balls. The neck diameter of Figure 7 as well as those of other naturalistic heads suggests that they were once placed on torsos. A basic cylinder is typical of the male torso representations here and at Nkwanta and Yoyo (Fig. 10). Only one torso from the Aowin area deviates from the strictly frontal and symmetrical poses so characteristic of Akan terracotta figures. Figure 11, with head and left leg missing, is posed as if in motion (danc- ing, walking, or possibly bending) with twisted torso and extended arms holding what may have been a musical instru- ment (horn or flute?). Dissueano In 1972, a small terracotta site was acci- dentally uncovered in the forest by an African Timber and Plywood logging crew. Two village chiefs from the towns of Yakasi and Dissueano claimed posses- sion, yet neither chief was able to offer 5 HEAD, 20cm YOYO SITE.

There were two additional factors that made ownership disputable; forest growth had made access to the site impossible for some time, and reallocation of village properties over the last hundred years was not traceable. I labeled the site after the village of Dissueano, since it is the closest landmark. Six terracotta heads survive, varying in height from 13 to 22 centimeters, and representing very minor variations in style from that dominating the Abo- kyia/Achimfu mmaso (Fig. 15). Indeed, the similarity between the heads from these two sites suggest the hand of a single artist. One head from Dissueano (Fig. 16) demonstrates a different vocabulary of facial expressions. It has incised, al- mond-contoured eyes framed in a heart-shaped face formed by the ridge of the eyebrows extending around the cheeks to the chin. The oval head, de- void of facial markings, has low earlobes and a tightly plaited coiffure represented by diagonally paired incised lines. The lips are represented by a slightly raised band reiterating the negative space created by the open mouth. The mouth is the most curious of all features, having no precedent among Aowin terracotta heads discovered to date. Evidence of three tubular, hollow tor- sos and ringed, solid necks implies that the statues were once full figures. No sign of stools, swords or other regalia, however, was found at the site. Jema One male head (Fig. 17) is the only sur- viving fragment from the Jema mmaso. The head is claimed by the current Tufuhene, Atta Arku, to be the portrait of one of Jema's first rulers, Eduatta I, who ruled as Tufuhene when they first came to their present location. It was described as having had a neck and resting on a clay stool surrounded by other figures in a mmaso at the outskirts of the village. Abandonment of the funerary art tradi- tion as well as abuse by children are the reasons given for the site's total destruc- tion. Legend exists in Jema regarding the practice of terracotta commemoration, even though there have been no mma artists during the lifetime of any present inhabitant. It is said that a woman potter was commissioned at the death of a ruler or a member of his family to sculpt a mma of the deceased. A true representation was thought to have been achieved by looking at the deceased's reflection in a bowl of palm oil while imploring his or her spirit to enter into the reflection. The statue was fired and placed in the mmaso forty days after death. The Jema terracotta is hollow, nat- uralistically modeled in near life-size proportions, and clearly of the same style as Figure 5 from Yoyo, Figures 3 and 4 from Nkwanta and Figure 7 from Abokyia/Achimfu. The coiffure was un- doubtedly added after the head was molded and, being the part most vulner- able to damage, has since fallen off. The remaining imprints suggest that the lost pieces of coiffure were modeled tufts of hair similar to those of Figure 7. Facial markings on this head, as well as the hole in the rear, resemble those on the naturalistic heads from the Yoyo, Nkwanta and Abokyia/Achimfu sites. The present Tufuhene, Atta Arku, be- lieved the application of notched marks was fashionable at the time to denote the wearer's power. He identified the raised, parallel lines as hair, and the hole in the rear as made for ease in firing.6 The most puzzling question connected with Aowin terracottas is, "Who made the now remainingmma and when?" The Aowin record of their history acknowl- edges a mass migration from the north- east into their present area, a tradition of making mma prior to their settlement, and the existence of a prolific mma tradi- tion among those who inhabited this area at the time of their arrival. Written history of the Aowin is scarce, with the earliest mention of their exis- tence and prominence in 1705 by Bos- man, who described the "Awine" as a powerful and wealthy gold-dealing people who lived inland from Axim (1907 [1705]:79). Bosman's record of their almost total defeat by the Denkyrans at the end of the seventeenth century em- phasized "Awine" military strength, in- cluding a mastery of the use of poison arrows. While this account omitted the date of this battle as well as the exact geographical location of the "Awine" traditional area, it almost without doubt authenticates the Aowin as an estab- lished and well-organized people in western Ghana by the end of the sev- enteenth century. Earlier and more precise seven- teenth-century Aowin history is specula- tive. The 1629 Dutch map of the Regions of Gold Coast in Guinea (Map 743 of the Leupen Collection, The Hague, re- printed in Ghana Notes and Queries, no. 9, 1966) made no specific mention of the "Awine." The area above Axim, how- ever, which might have been Aowin country, was labeled "Igwijra," an area rich in gold where the Portuguese had "a little stronghold, where they traded, and brought their trade (goods) up the little river in canoes . . ." (Daaku 1966:14). It seems probable that this stronghold was the same small fort built 24 kilometers up the Ankobra River by the Portuguese in 1623, where they defended themselves against the poison arrow attacks of the Aowin (Claridge 1964:87; Ward 1958:76). Reference to the Aowin or Brossa-speak- ing people7 occupying an area closer to the coast than they do today is also made by Manoukian in her discussion of the Etsi, who record meeting the Brossa people upon the Etsi arrival at the coast in the thirteenth century (1950:13). Aowin oral history, nevertheless, be- TOP LEFT: 7. HEAD, 28cm. ABOKYIA/ACHIMFU SITE. TOP RIGHT: 8. HEAD, 23cm. ABOKYIA/ACHIMFU SITE. BOT- TOM LEFT: 9. POT, 11cm. ABOKYINA/ACHIMFU SITE.

In the role of tradi- tional historian, the late Aowin chief lin- guist (akyeamehene) retold Aowin history from the time of their migration away from the Ashanti/Denkyra struggles for supremacy: "The Aowin, under the leadership of a man named Ano Asima and two brothers, Abu Wusu and Aka Semudu, headed southwest into the forest leaving their new home, which they called Anwiaawia. Before leaving, they hired a northern priest and warrior, Abirimoro, as a path burner to assure safe delivery to their home. Ano Asima intended to meet the chief of Kotoka in what is now the Ivory Coast. Before reaching his destination, he was in- formed that this particular chief was 'far oft' so Ano Asima met instead with the ruler of this region, a woman called Nana Attabra, who ruled from Nkwanta. Ano Asima eventually married this female chief and united his people with the existing inhabitants-a people who did not speak Brossa but spoke a similar lan- guage.8 "At Yagaso, a place near the present town of Yankoman, Ano Asima was di- rected by the god Effuen to settle in this area.9 With Yagaso as the first capital, Ano Asima and his people remained while Aka Semudu led his people southwest to Krinjabo. Ano Asima's original land is believed to have reached north of the Bia River to include the Yoyo forest, west of the Tano River to Krinjabo and south to the village of Jema. They have had five capital towns since their initial settlement-Yagaso, Enchi Kro- fuaso, Kranchekrom, Akutubu and En- chi. The Baule people supposedly lived to the east, and the Anyi were already well established in the area at the time of the Aowin arrival. They never fought the Baule, but while living in Kranchekrom a battle was fought with the Anyi at Sutri, an island in the Tano River south of Jema. The Aowin asked the god of the Tano for help and, as the story is told, the god lowered the river level enough for them to cross and defeat their enemy. From this time on, the island has existed as the main Tano shrine for the Aowin."10 The historical events of this migration as propagated by the Brafe people in Krinjabo confirm the Aowin account (Mouezy 1942:42; Amon d'Aby 1960:68; Perrot 1970:1668). Taking into considera- tion the understandable differences in spelling between foreign transcriptions and the accuracy lost in transmitting oral tradition over a long period of time, Mouezy's account reiterates the same mass migration near the turn of the eighteenth century. He estimates the founding of the Krinjabo kingdom at their present location to be after the de- parture of the French in 1704, and based on the chronology of Krinjabo chiefs, the kingdom probably began about 1725 (1942:42). In correlating the two oral his- tories, this implies that Yagaso, the first Brossa capital, was founded by the first quarter of the eighteenth century. This estimate corresponds to the time they fled the Denkyra/Ashanti battles, which ended by 1701 with the Ashanti in power. The Aowin chronology of chiefs sug- gests the same time for their migration. The chieftaincy of Ano Asima was fol- lowed by that of Kwame Wandawanda, who was not of the royal family but was enstooled only for leadership during a war with the Ashanti. The third chief, Tano Kwaw Brembuin, was remembered by the Aowin chief linguist as having paid a war tribute to the Ashanti, likely the same tribute described by Wilks of 600 ounces of gold paid by the Aowin to the Ashanti in 1715 (1975:23). Support for the historical relationship between the ruling Aowin (Brossa peo- ple) in Ghana and the Anyi (Braf6 peo- ple) in Krinjabo in the Ivory Coast is suggested not only by the similarity of their oral accounts regarding migrations to their present locations but also by their present formal communications. Further ritual similarities between their annual festivals confirm these historical stories and imply an association established prior to their migrations. 11 Similarity in artistic forms between the Aowin and Anyi of Krinjabo appears to be inevitable considering their joint mig- ration and historical ties, which included the same tradition of sculpting terracotta figures of their deceased and placing them in a mmaso. A survey of the ter- racottas from Krinjabo shows that they bear a remarkable likeness to the Aowin terracotta heads from Abokyia/Achimfu and Dissueano (Figs. 13,14,15) that have elaborate coiffures and pinched-slit fa- cial features. One of the more consistent and curious traits found on Krinjabo ter- racotta heads is a mound of one to four (usually three to four) raised facial marks between the eyebrows, on the cheeks below each eye, and between the ear and 13.

This combination of marks cor- responds directly to those on the major- ity of heads from Abokyia/Achimfu and Dissueano. The Aowin do not acknowl- edge ever having tribal facial marks. Claridge, however, mentions that the Brossa people had three little parallel lines on either cheek just below the eyes (1964 [1915]:36), which would corres- pond to the facial marks on terracottas from the Aowin and Krinjabo areas. In comparison, the more naturalisti- cally rendered Aowin heads found at Yoyo, Nkwanta, Jema and AbokyialAch- imfu (Figs. 3-7, 17) are equally consistent in representation but are unprecedented in the Krinjabo area. Other naturalistic, hollow heads of near life size, however, existed in Ashanti, Fomena, Twifo, Ka- fudidi-Huni Valley, and some were found also in Kwahu and Ahinsan.12 While there is no direct parallel for Aowin naturalism, the heads retrieved from Fomena and the Kafudidi-Huni Valley bear the closest stylistic similari- ties. Fomena naturalism, like that of the Aowin, employed a type of geometric conventionalization of features. The almond-shaped eyes on Fomena heads are depicted in relief beneath arched eyebrows; in contrast, those of the Aowin are oval with round pupils reces- sed beneath a sharply overhanging forehead. Fomena heads are round, not attenuated ovals, and the lips have an accentuated fleshy quality lacking in the small, slit mouths on Aowin examples. The use of facial holes, as seen in Figure 7, is common to both, as are coiffure and headdress patterns. The Fomena terra- cotta statues, however, were placed directly on the grave, which suggests a distinct difference in the use of funerary figures. The hollow, fully modeled ter- racotta examples from Kafudidi in the Huni Valley (now in the British Museum) have been compared to the Fomena ex- amples (Wild &amp; Braunholtz 1934:4) and should be credited as having characteris- tics similar to the Aowin naturalistic heads, though little is known of their use. Several factors suggest that this naturalistic style of funerary terracotta, considering the numerous surviving examples, was a well-established artistic tradition from Jema to the Yoyo Forest by 1700, when the Brossa-speaking Aowin arrived. The Aowin claim that an Anyi woman commissioned by Nana Attabra made the mma at Nkwanta, all of which are rendered in this style. The Aowin chief linguist, queenmother, and the priestess of the Nkwanta mmaso stressed the reputation of Anyi mma artists as having been the best and having made many portraits like those at Nkwanta. If Nkwanta was the actual site of Nana At- tabra, it is probable that she employed her own artist(s) for her mmaso. Sec- ondly, the inhabitants of the nearby vil- lage of Adeikrom did not know "the people before them who lived on the hill" where the Yoyo mmaso was located, and, moreover, the Aowin chief linguist made it clear that the Yoyo site was not acknowledged as an official Aowin ter- racotta mmaso. It is significant, therefore, that the naturalistic style is found at Yoyo and that the pinched-slit style mma (re- miniscent of Krinjabo examples) is to- tally lacking. Aowin settlement patterns from the early eighteenth century to the present have not dominated the northern re- gions of the Yoyo Forest, while the areas around Nkwanta, Abokyia/Achimfu and Dissueano have been densely popu- lated. In Abokyia/Achimfu, where both styles exist, evidence of artistic borrow- ing can be seen, as might be expected during a period of assimilation. The ter- racotta finds from the five Aowin sites confirm the stylistic and historical con- nections between the Aowin and the Anyi of Krinjabo and demonstrate a greater geographical range to the anal- ogous but slightly dissimilar naturalism found in Fomena and the Huni Valley. A definitive study of funerary ter- racotta cannot yet be written, since addi- tional terracotta finds like those of the Aowin, spanning a variety of styles and several centuries, are continually being uncovered and identified. Many newly discovered pieces, unfortunately, are circulating without documentation, as traders acquire them in the forest and bring them to the coast for sale on the European and American markets. Such uncontrollable marketing stresses the need for area studies and documentation in situ. Unknown sites undoubtedly re- main in southern Ghana and eastern Ivory Coast. It is hoped that studies in these areas will uncover further data on the producers and the diffusion of a now moribund artistic tradition. Notes, page 97 16. HEAD, 19cm. DISSUEANO SITE. 17.

Field research among the Aowin was made financially possible through a National Defense Foreign Language Fellowship and a fellow- ship from the University of California, Santa Barbara Art Affiliates. A special note of gratitude is due Nana Boafo Ntaa II, Omanhene of the Aowin Traditional Area, who was repre- sentative of the hospitality and generosity offered me by the Aowin people; the staff of the National Museum of Ghana for their cooperation and for allowing me access to the museum terracotta collection; and especially to Michael Coronel for his supportive consultations and suggestions. 3. The National Museum of Ghana sent an investigating team to this site in 1967 and collected terracotta fragments as well as two early nineteenth-century gin bottles and three beads. The bottles and beads were reported missing by the museum in October 1972. An extensive excavation or com- parative study on the Yoyo site was never made, the only National Museum analysis being that of Kwasi Myles (1967). 4. These marks were described as "donko scars," old slave markings that used to be placed on a free person or some- times just on the deceased's mma to deceive evil spirits. The same explanation for similar markings has been noted by Bellis (1972:112) and Rattray (1927:65). 5. The crow's feet design was clearly considered by the Aowins questioned to be the mark given to a child born after his mother had lost her previous child in or prior to childbirth. Such a child is thought to be the persistent spirit of the unborn who has "gone and come again." 6. A hole in the rear of hollow terracotta beads can also be found on examples from Adansi-Ahinsan and Twifo. Bellis explains that the Twifo people thought the hole to be for the insertion of hair clippings of the deceased, which is similar to the Ashanti ritual described by Rattray where the hair of the deceased's blood relations was placed in theabusua kuruwa, or "family pot" (Bellis 1972:113; Rattray 1927:164). 7. The Aowin speak Brossa or Brissa, which is part of the Anyi-Twi language group within the Niger-Congo family of African languages. Brossa is spoken in two areas of Ghana: in the Aowin Traditional Area and in northeastern Ghana on the Togo border in the Chereponi and Sansanne Mango area by the Tchakosi (Cakosi). Manoukian supports Rattray's data that the Cakosi ancestors came from the south, most likely from the forest country near the present Ivory Coast/Ghana frontier, having been hired as mercenaries by the Dagomba or Mamprise (Mamprusi) some centuries ago (Manoukian 1951:7; Rattray 1932:112-113; Stewart 1966:66-71). The current Aowin confirm their relatives' existence and northward mig- ration. Migration motive and date, however, can not be ver- ified, and political and social ties no longer seem to be in practice. 8. The chief of Nkwanta, to this day, is called "the chief's wife" (Ahenerye) in memory of Ano Asima's marriage to Nana Attabra. 9. The god Effuen appeared to the brothers and Abirimoro as a white mirage in the forest. To my knowledge, this appear- ance marks the beginning of the worship of Effuen as a major Aowin deity. 10. A short description of this shrine was given by J. Paton in 1948. In his pamphlet, The Worship of the Tano Fetish, he de- scribed figures carved out of stone located on the island of Sutri. With the help of the Jema chief and guides, I attempted to visit Sutri, with H. M. Cole and V. Ebin, in Februaryl973 to study these statues. The water level of the Tano at that time was low enough to make the island accessible but high enough to hide the alleged figures beneath the water. Regard- less of the figures' existence, whether they be hand-carved or water-formed, Sutri remains an important Aowin shrine where annual prayers and libations are offered at the begin- ning of each new year. 11. The ruling families retain communication, especially dur- ing the cultural peak periods (i.e., death with the royal family or a change in rule). The Aowin annual festival, Eluelie, occurs at the beginning of the new year after the yam harvest in the third week (anaa) of their monthly calendar. The Eluelie corresponds to the Anyi festival in Krinjabo, ignames or elw?- li (Amon d'Aby 1960:27), celebrated in the same week (anaa). 12. A hollow, naturalistically modeled terracotta head of life-size proportions and two torso fragments have been at- tributed to the Aowin by George Preston (1970, Figs. 37, 37a). A head of the same style is in the Katherine White collection (illustrated in R. F. Thompson, African Art in Motion, 1974, pl. 5). Since these heads were not attributed in situ, it is impossi- ble to be certain of their Aowin origin. Facial features, how- ever, are softer, with less conventionalized angularity than is seen in the Aowin examples studied by this writer. PATRICIA CORONEL, Bibliography Ameyaw, Kwabena. 1966.
