      <p>Most students love watching and critiquing popular movies; this lesson allows students to do both while encouraging them to think deeper about the consequences of scientific misinformation in popular media sources such as the movies or television, especially those aimed at children. During a review on insects, we engaged high school biology students in a content analysis of <italic>Bee Movie</italic> (2007, DreamWorks). Our investigation uncovered multiple factual errors related to insect anatomy, life cycles, and behaviors and led to some great discussions about the necessity of science-related media-literacy skills. Ideas for assessment and extension are included.</p>

         <title>Rationale</title>
         <p>Today’s children obtain many of their scientific ideas from popular media sources; however, these sources often present incorrect information in the name of entertainment. Additionally, many children lack the personal experiences with nature that might counteract misinformation that is picked up from the media (Louv, 2008). Research indicates that erroneous ideas or misconceptions can be very tenacious and often interfere with subsequent learning in science (Driver et al., 1994). A systematic investigation of the scientific content of a movie helps students learn to ask questions, develop critical-viewing skills, and analyze and evaluate media messages. As science teachers, we need to ensure that students leave our classrooms with the abilities necessary to critique scientific information in whatever format it enters their lives (MacKenzie, 2007).</p>

                  <p>Follow your school’s guidelines to obtain permission to show <italic>Bee Movie</italic> to your students. If time doesn’t allow showing the entire movie, preview it and decide which scenes best fit your classroom’s objectives. Please note: under the Fair Use provision of copyright law, teachers are allowed to use copyrighted material without permission if their purpose is to teach students how to critique and analyze it (<uri xlink:href="http://www.center forsocialmedia.org/fair-use">http://www.center forsocialmedia.org/fair-use</uri>).</p>

                  <p>Decide how to handle the insect/bees review. Students can do their own research about bees in the library or on the Internet; however, we suggest providing some initial resources to ensure that they have the necessary background knowledge for their evaluation of the movie. Our favorite resources included the books <italic>Plan Bee: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know about the Hardest Working Creatures on the Planet</italic> (Brackney, 2010) and <italic>Honey Bees: Letters from the Hive</italic> (Buchmann, 2011), chapters 1 and 2, as well as the film <italic>Bees: Tales from the Hive</italic> (2007, NOVA). Other resources might be found in your school or public library. If time is not an issue, ask around to see whether there is an experienced local beekeeper, a university extension group, or a conservation agent who is willing to come in as a guest speaker or even as a participant in the movie review.</p>

               <list-item>
                  <p>Divide your students into teams, assigning each a topic on which to focus their review. We used the topics Bee Anatomy, Life Cycle, Bee Behaviors, and Making Honey for our groups. If the class is large, other topics could be assigned or these topics could be used for more than one group. We preselected material from the above sources for each group to review. Although each group was free to critique in any topic area, asking the students to specialize cut down on the amount of time spent in preparation and helped the students to focus during the movie.</p>

               <list-item>
                  <p>We started this lesson by asking students, “Where do people get ideas about science?” On whiteboards, in small groups, students listed all the places they had learned “science.” Answers included TV/movies, books (fiction and nonfiction), parents/friends, school, textbooks, news reports, and personal experiences.</p>
               </list-item>
               <list-item>
                  <p>We asked students to rank (on their whiteboards) these sources of scientific information in order of likelihood of accuracy; that is, which source was most likely to present accurate information, and so on, down to the source most likely to contain inaccurate information. Answers varied, of course, and the discussion was interesting. There was no right or wrong answer that we were looking for with this task. The point was to stimulate the idea that misinformation abounds, even being found in science classrooms and textbooks.</p>
               </list-item>
               <list-item>
                  <p>Next, we switched gears to a quick review of “What is an insect?” Students were given actual specimens of insects (4 pinned insects per table). We asked them to list similarities among the specimens, hoping they would remember the characteristics of insects in the process. If pinned insects are not available, pictures of insects would also work. Answers included 6 legs, 3-part bodies, antennae, exoskeletons, wings, jointed appendages, etc. Afterward, we reviewed the classification of insects (how they fit into the animal kingdom) on the board.</p>
               </list-item>
               <list-item>
                  <p>We gave students a brief overview of the rest of the assignment: (1) review a bee-related topic in a small group; (2) watch <italic>Bee Movie</italic> with the objective of identifying inaccuracies in fact or in attitude (i.e., where does the movie make obvious factual errors, and does it portray underlying stereotypes or negative messages about bees/insects and beekeepers?); (3) present findings to class; and (4) discuss implications of the findings. Students were assigned to their groups and given resources to review. Individual notes were required and assessed for both the review session and the movie, allowing students to practice their note-taking skills in their science class. Presentations were given via whiteboard. Our students used individual whiteboards measuring approximately 1.5 feet by 2 feet in size; however, presentations could also be given via the classroom whiteboard, through a computer/projector system, or in a poster session. Students discussed both what was wrong and what was right about the movie. Some of their answers are included in Table 1.</p>
               </list-item>
               <list-item>
                  <p>Finally, we wrapped up the lesson with a discussion about scientific misconceptions (sources and consequences), media literacy skills, and a “Why everyone should learn some science” discussion. Students contributed numerous examples of “bad science” from the movies to the discussion.</p>
