<plain_text><page sequence="1">CAVES AND KARST OF THE HINDENBURG RANGES DAVID BROOK The expedition investigated 2500 km of rugged limestone country in the West Sepik province of Papua New Guinea, between the Strickland Gorge and the Irian Jaya border. The main objectives were the location and mapping of caves in the high altitude karst of the Hindenburg mountains and the study of their biology, hydrology and structure. Two hundred systems were recorded and some were of vast dimensions. One open pit was 280 m deep and descents were made into other shaft systems for 340 m and 360 m. The longest cave located was Selminum Tem, in which 20-5 km of passages were surveyed and the fossil skeleton of a Miocene syrenian was discovered. Three appendices report briefly on the geomorphology, biology and anthropology of the area. Successive levels of phreatic cave development are identified and interpreted in terms of four standstills during tilting and uplift of the region from sea level. Deposits within Selminum Tem place two glacial events in the sequence of stand? stills. The Selminum Tem fauna was unexpected for a cave in a tropical area. It exhib- ited geographical misfits and species with no near relatives amongst the surface fauna. The mixture of marine relicts and thermophilic and cryophilic refugees support the past environmental changes deduced from the geomorphological study. The regional anthropology is reviewed and reference is made to the significance of caves in local legends. Art and burial sites in small caves visited by the local people are described; the engravings, hearths and excavations in Selminum Tem, however, belong to a past cultural phase. FROM APRIL to December 1975, a British speleological expedition investigated the high altitude karst areas between the Strickland Gorge and the Star Mount? ains of Papua New Guinea. Its aims were to locate, explore and survey caves and study their hydrology, structural controls, sequence of development, and bio- speleology in the hope of obtaining detailed evidence about the chronology of uplift and erosion in this geologically active zone of the circum-Pacific orogenic belt. Planning and organization took two years, and with the support of institutions and industry, a strong team of 24 was fielded, including a doctor and speleologists from several disciplines. In April, a two-man advance team reconnoitred several outstanding karst features noted on air photographs. Using local carriers, tracks were cut to these, and large sinking rivers and open pits were reached high in the mountains south and west of Telefomin. The reconnaisance report being favour? able, the. main expedition was launched from the United Kingdom. Telefomin, a sub-district headquarters, is sited on old lake deposits amongst the headwaters of the Sepik River at 1500 m above sea level. All the prominent mount? ain ridges are orientated east-west. Most are of Miocene limestone (300 to 1500 m thick) and have scarps facing south. The creation of New Guinea is due to its position on the northern margin of the Australian plate where the subduction of several Pacific sub-plates is taking place (Smith, 1965). The Miocene limestone has been overthrust repeatedly to form the central mountain chain against the deeply eroded Muller Anticline to the south. Gravity sliding has been proposed on each limb of the Muller Anticline to account for the stripping of the limestone. (Jenkins, 1974). The uplift of the region from the Pliocene onwards was associated with ?^ David Brook is engaged in Textile Physics research at Leeds University, and was leader and scientific co-ordinator ofthe 1975 British speleological expedition to Papua New Guinea.</page><page sequence="2">28 CAVES AND KARST OF THE HINDENBURG RANGES intrusive events which emplaced the Star Mountain granodiorites and the copper rich Fubilan Stock (Geological Survey of Papua New Guinea 1974). Earthquake activity indicates that uplift is still in progress although the major activity and vulcanism are now concentrated in the northern islands such as New Britain. The highly orientated ridges have imposed a trellis drainage pattern and deep gorges. The headwaters of the Sepik River have dissected the alluvial lake deposits in the Telefomin Basin as the main river has cut the Sepik Gorge in its route northwards to the New Guinea plains. To the north-east of Telefomin, the Om River joins the Strickland, which has excavated a great gorge as it passes south through the central mountains to join the Fly River drainage. There is little surface runoff from the limestone, but springs at the base of the Hindenburg Wall (the most prominent scarp in the region) flow south into the Fly River catchment, as does the Ok Tedi which collects water from the southern slopes of the Star Mountains. P A P u A^ C&gt;xJL^^ 152? (ft- ?# Expedition area Fig. 1. General location map Rainfall is high but variable; 10 000 mm have been recorded in a single year near the Ok Tedi mining camp at Tabubil, but only about half of this occurs in the inter-mountain valleys such as Telefomin. During May to October, south-east winds bring rain to the southern slopes which are consistently clouded over, while the central and northern parts of the ranges are relatively clear of cloud. For the rest of the year the situation is reversed but with less rainfall and cloud cover. Topo? graphical control is most apparent, the Hindenburg Wall acting as a barrier to shield the Finim Tel plateau from the full onslaught of the south-east monsoon, for instance. Maximum temperatures vary from 37?C at Tabubil to 25?C on the high peaks (3000-4000 m) with minimums of 20?C to 0?C. Rain forest is the predominant vegetation but extensive kunai grassland occurs near villages and on some hillsides, probably as a result of burning off. Above 2000 m, the trees are more stunted, and at 2500 to 3000 m, the moss forest becomes predominant. Isolated sharp 3000 m peaks and gentle slopes above 3300 m are covered in tall wiry scrub, making progress even more difficult, but the</page><page sequence="3">CAVES AND KARST OF THE HINDENBURG RANGES 29 highest peaks ofthe Star Mountains (3900 m) are bare rock or grass-covered. Severe vegetation damage due to the frosts and drought of 1972 was still apparent (Brown and Powell, 1973). The expedition In July, 1975, the main group flew to Port Moresby and took a chartered DC 3 (still the most efficient work horse!) to Mount Hagen. The freight had arrived at the port of Lae and had been brought up the Highlands Highway to Mount Hagen whence it was to be ferried into Telefomin, which is only accessible by air or on foot. We chose the former means of transport as time was at a premium. The local administration and people of Telefomin were most helpful and, unexpectedly, we were lent a bungalow as our base. From experience on the reconnaissance, we decided to deploy most people on the Finim Tel plateau to allow acclimatization to the bush and the terrain. The route was across the upper Sepik to Urapmin from where the tributary valley of the Iram River was followed to the group of villages at Tifalmin, dominated by Mount Aiyung (3100 m). This limestone mountain had been climbed during the reconnaissance but no caves were found. There was a small airstrip at Tifalmin but, because of its dangerous condition, only mission planes used it. Nevertheless the mission ferried our supplies in and local carriers took the loads over the Bahrman Mountains to the Finim Tel base camp. There radio com? munication was set up with Telefomin and field work began (Figures 2a and 2b). The large pits previously noted ended at depths of 180 m in boulder chokes and the first caves entered were only short. One group spent a week on top of Mount Fugulil (3030 m), which towers above Finim Tel, battling with the springy bush but they found only small caves. It was unlikely that the dolines on FuguhTs summit would lead to deep systems, for the block of limestone is separated from the plateau beds by thick shales. Rivers, rising on these same unmapped shales below the Bahrman Mountains, sank on reaching the plateau. Cutting to four of these sinks (those of the Feram, Bitip, Kaakil and Finim Rivers) led to extensive cave systems up to 2 km long with different phases of development, but ending in sumps well above the resurgence levels below the Hindenburg Wall. Previous experience in New Guinea (and indeed world-wide) has led to the conclusion that huge dolines do not provide entry to caverns of like dimensions. We are now able to disprove this rule. One of the carriers knew of a cave in a giant doline where his people used to hunt flying-foxes and he led a party to this feature. The doline was huge (500 m across and 130 m deep) and the flying-fox cave impres? sive but short. At the base of a 120 m cliff, however, a powerful cold draught lashed the trees obscuring a low opening, and exploration revealed an enormous and continuing cavern. Later survey and recording linked the Upper and Lower Caves. The Upper (flying-fox) Cave contained mysterious man-made pits and the Lower Cave had engravings and hearths near the Dee Inlet, 200 m from the entrance?but there were no footprints on the dusty floor (see Appendix III). The great cave, Selminum Tem, consisted of a main trunk route with large chambers (Copernicus, Newton) and ox-bow passages (Spacewalk, Moonwalk). One and a half km into the cave, a deep trench was encountered leading down through Monolith Cavern to mud-choked tubes, and up along Coprates Canyon until a series of tributary passages finally emerged from three separate entrances in thick forest. Much later in the expedition these were shown to be close to both the Feram caves and to those associated with the Kaakil River, particularly Ok Tem. The main passages of Selminum Tem totalled some 10 km but beneath them was an equal length of maze-like tunnel systems in the Copernicus, Newton and Monolith Cavern</page><page sequence="4">30 CAVES AND KARST OF THE HINDENBURG RANGES Fig. 2a. Expedition routes west of Telefomin. For key and scale, see Fig. 2b. regions. Whilst fixing the positions of the entrances, the tracks being cut led to the discovery of two more important caves. The first was at the top of the Selminum Doline and consisted of very ancient passages encrusted with flowstone, hence the name, the Milky Way. The second was three caves in one (Trinity Cave), and the largest had a huge main tunnel reminiscent of Selminum Tem. (Figure 3). The Finim River was dye-tested to the Kam and Kaakil resurgences below the Hinden- burg Wall. Above the latter resurgence, a kilometre of intricate passages liable to flooding was entered and, from a helicopter, a close inspection was made of a large entrance half way up a nearly vertical 600 m cliff, a possible target for future exploration. Independence Day for Papua New Guinea was on 16 September, and our team went back to Telefomin to join in the celebrations. Some returned to Finim Tel; others went on patrols to investigate further afield. In the Tifalmin valley, shafts were descended high on the Bahrman Mountains and burial and rock shelters, some with rock drawings, were recorded. Across the Iram River, the old system of Ok Kemimaal was surveyed and our biologists found unusual troglobites. Close to Telefomin itself, another old cave (Bem Tem) had remarkable marine relic troglo? bites. The sink ofthe Ok Agim, south of Tifalmin, was another flying-fox hunting site, commemorated in local legend (as was Selminum Tem). One very spectacular cave ended in a syphon at a depth of 170 m. To complete the cirumnavigation of Mount Fugulil, a patrol searched (unsuccessfully) for caves in the dry bed of the Migal River and then proceeded to the Ok Agim. West from Telefomin, small groups walked to Feramin bound for sinks high on Mount Wamtakin (3600 m). Local guides led them to an area north-west of Feramin called Wam Tigiin and several small caves were explored before they re- traced their steps and continued to the east col of Mount Wamtakin, where several sinks led to systems 150 m deep in steep thrust faults. A similar pothole nearer Feramin was not fully explored but the re-emergence of the water was only 300 m below the entrance. The patrol reached Oksapmin but the large sinks here and near Tekin were impassable because of water and flood debris. The longest patrol of the expedition was a very light-weight affair with two members and two carriers, with their world on their backs and existing on dehyd-</page><page sequence="5">CAVES AND KARST OF THE HINDENBURG RANGES 31 Fig. 2b. Expedition routes east of Telefomin rated food and textured vegetable protein. Their objective was the Star Mountains (Shepherd, 1968) and their route lay up the Iram River and down the Nong River to a geological camp near Busilmin. A long drag took them up to the Star Mount? ains and they climbed Mount Capella (3900 m), the highest point. Great enclosed poljes were investigated and the abrupt vegetation changes within them, at a fixed level, confirmed that their unusual flora was due to cold air collecting in them at night. Rare examples unaffected in this way had strong air currents emerging at the bottom. The tall grasses and isolated tree ferns, which can withstand frosts and long exposure to low temperatures, had been noted in dolines on Mounts Fugulil and Wamtakin but these examples provided the unequivocal explanation of the pheno- menon. Few caves were found, but outcrops of intrusive granodiorites were noted, and, on the way back via the base of the Hindenburg Wall and Golgobip, a visit was paid to the mining camp at Tabubil. South of Urapmin, more dolines were inspected but only one deep shaft was found, so the main team moved into the second promising area located during the reconnaissance. Due south of Telefomin, a series of large but floodable caves were mapped at the headwaters of the Nong River and a vast pit (Tina Bu Tem) descended to minus 280 m. An advance base was pitched in the moss forest at Mogondabip and holes investigated for a distance of 5 km along a fault-controlled valley, at an altitude of 2500 m. Three deep holes were found (220, 360 and 340 m) but all were technically very difficult and became tight or choked. Summary of results The expedition reconnoitred 2500 km2 of limestone country ranging in altitude from 3900 m to 400 m. Most of the area, however, was only briefly investigated by small teams who visited some of the larger karst features visible on air photographs and noted the range and distribution of karstforms; 200 caves and pots were located and explored and 37 km of underground systems were surveyed, mostly in two widely separated areas. Large river caves in the Nong valley, south of Telefomin, were the probable outlets for numerous pots 1000 m higher in a fault- controlled valley trending up towards Mt Burimsakin. The major pots (220, 340 and 360 m) confirmed that deep holes in Papua New Guinea are usually associated</page><page sequence="6">32 CAVES AND KARST OF THE HINDENBURG RANGES H( Feram ?

Evolution stages ofthe Finim Tel plateau and caves with faults, but the great open pit of Tina Bu Tem (280 m), part-way up the mountain, was not on the main fault line. The Finim Tel plateau, between the Bahrman Mountains and the Hindenburg Wall, was the site of much of the expedition's exploration and scientific work. Four- sinking rivers were investigated and 28 km of cave systems were surveyed on the plateau, 20.5 km comprising the giant cave of Selminum Tem which proved a storehouse of information. The biologists found a rich cave fauna and unexpected relicts from past climatic changes. Cave art and occupation sites were noted and the structure of the cave itself was found to be a record of the uplift and erosion of the mountain range. Prominent in the eroded sediments within Selminum Tem were</page><page sequence="8">34 CAVES AND KARST OF THE HINDENBURG RANGES pebbles of granodiorite (Plate IHa). Similar pebbles occured in the Kaakil River and boulders of the same material, about 2 m in size, were found in the headwaters of the Finim River. Boulders of granodiorite and chert were noted in section, always resting directly on bed-rock shale, and covered by thick clay with ill-sorted blocks of local limestones and siltstones. No outcrops of granodiorite exist to explain the ribbon distribution of the boulders and they are probably erosion-resistant rem- nants of glacial deposits transported from the region west of Mt Aiyung. They certainly do not date from the last glacial event when ice descended to an altitude of only 3100 m in the Star Mountains (Shepherd, 1965) and the solifluction clays which overlie the boulders were deposited below the Bahrman Mountains. More probably they date from a severe earlier glaciation, whose deposits are now all but obliterated. Further fragmentary evidence for such an event has been noted on Mt Giluwae (Loffler, 1972), and perhaps the Main Glaciation (i.e., the last glacial) of New Guinea is a misnomer. A fossil skeleton was found in some obscure passages of Selminum Tem beneath Tycho. It consisted of silicified vertebrae and ribs in situ embedded in Miocene limestone 150 m below the top of the succession (i.e., about 23 million years old). The 2-5 m long animal has been provisionally identified by Dr. Wells, of Flinders University, as a syrenian (sea cow), a browser in shallow warm seas and swamps. In Ok Tem, the cave of the Kaakil River, more bones were found in a cherty bed only 30 m below the top of the limestone. These fossils, and the muddy nature of some of the calcareous beds, point to a shallow water environment for the deposition of the Miocene limestone in this region. A deep water origin is most unlikely. Studies of the chemistry, temperature and precipitation response of the percolation inlets within Selminum Tem showed that most were well-integrated drainage channels having fast response to rainfall, even at a depth of 150 m from the surface. Some channels, however, are not part ofthe well-integrated networks and showed little or no variation during the study period of three months. These sluggish percolation routes are more common in passages at shallow depth; but they vary more with precipitation than those at depth, and deposit soft 'moonmilk' calcite. The vari? ation of percolation waters with depth of limestone penetrated is complicated by the change in surface landforms above the cave. Belts of karst-forms occur between the river sinks at the shale edge and the abrupt cut-off of the limestone at the Hindenburg Wall. The karst-forms, ranging from dolines in shale to large scale tower karst, illustrate a sequence of development after the stripping of the shale cover. First, dolines form in the thinning shale and, as limestone is exposed at their bases, deep clefts appear. The familiar, close-spaced towers are formed as the shale is eroded completely, but eventually the spacing increases, and solution along bedding planes undermines the towers. Collapse results and the first generation towers are reduced to rubble. The debris is dissolved by precipitation and, with second gen? eration tower formation, the cycle begins again. Debris accumulation and the non- synchronous nature of later cycles reduce the height of towers above the general plateau surface. The surveyed caves of Finim Tel, the Nong River and the fault-controlled valley were linked by BCRA grade 5 surface traverses (Ellis, 1976). At Finim Tel, a base line was set out on Mt Fugulil and a theodolite triangulation was carried out of the peaks surrounding the plateau and of visible key points in the surface surveys. The shale/limestone boundary, large dolines and tower karst areas were mapped from air photo interpretation and ground investigation. The triangulation linked previously fixed points around the Ok Tedi and Tifalmin copper prospects and will prove useful in deciding the route of a proposed road between the mineral deposits.</page><page sequence="9">CAVES AND KARST OF THE HINDENBURG RANGES 35 APPENDIX I CAVE DEVELOPMENT, UPLIFT AND EROSION OF THE FINIM TEL The caves The four major sinking rivers of Finim Tel enter caves of very different character. The Feram and Finim caves are simple, shallow and end in sumps. The Bitip water also enters a sump in immature passages but abandoned tunnels form two distinct levels, the higher being 25 m above the present river sink at the shale/ limestone boundary. A dry valley continues south and is the collapsed continuation of the lower level (Figure 3). Most extensive of all the river caves are those associ? ated with the Kaakil, where a labyrinth is often inundated by floods. Beyond the last entrance, large abandoned tunnels are apparent at two distinct levels and the river cuts a deep canyon through the Ok Tem to a huge sump. The largest and highest level of Ok Tem continues via remnant passage sections between dolines to the Tradesman's Entrance of Selminum Tem. It now unites with passages, at a similar level, from the Keyhole and Backdoor entrances, to form the main trunk of the cave, 30 to 50 m wide (Plate Illb). A great canyon is cut in its floor beginning at the Stargate and terminating at Monolith Cavern. Beyond the canyon the trunk passage undulates, the high points being bypassed by large low level ox-bows, and below the Astradome, Newton, Kepler and Copernicus regions are three dimen- sional mazes of tubes. All the water now entering Selminum Tem originates from percolation and eventually drops into deep sumps in the lower mazes. Although these sumps are at lower levels than those in the river caves at the back of the plateau, they are still well above the Kaakil resurgence. In the Selminum Doline, the Upper Cave represents a fragment of another great tube 50 m higher than the trunk route of the Lower (main) Cave. The higher level is seen again in a nearby collapse and at the Trinity Cave, but even more significant are the old tubes of the Milky Way Cave at the top of the doline and 100 m above the level of the river sinks (Figure 4). Speleogenesis The plans of the Finim Tel caves (Figure 3) indicate that the now abandoned tunnels were once the main drains for earlier rivers sinking at the back of the plateau. Even the highest fragments of the Milky Way and Bitip caves mirror the course of later, more complete, passage systems. Apart from the vadose passages of the present river caves, the fossil canyon of Selminum Tem, and some minor trenches, all the conduits in the area developed in phreatic conditions (i.e., under water); domed or even circular cross-sections are the norm. Roof pockets, three dimensional mazes of tubes, fretted rock and spans fulfil the phreatic criteria of Bretz (1942) but the red clay of his fill stage is absent, all sediments having been carried in by past rivers and more recent flood torrents. Selminum Tem and associ? ated systems were formed under phreatic conditions by sinking rivers powerful enough to transport pebbles and cobbles through the large tunnels for 3 km or more. The limestones of the plateau have dips of up to 20 to the north, and the caves (past and present) must run against the dip to reach the resurgences. However, in spite of the 600 m thickness of limestone, the chosen routes are not deep phreatic as envisaged by Bretz but are relatively shallow (Swinnerton, 1932). The main trunk route of Selminum Tem takes advantage of variations in dip direction to keep a low gradient course close to the strike of the beds. To maintain its shallow course, it 'tacks' through the steeper beds and a fine dip modified tube (Ford, 1971) between Tycho and Kepler indicates a phreatic amplitude of 50 m. A dip tube in the higher Trinity/Upper Cave system has a similar amplitude and these features carried water up and down the bedding, taking the path of least overall resistance near the top of the phreas. Widely differing phreatic processes are at work in the area. The flashy input to the river caves results in regular floods,</page><page sequence="10">36 CAVES AND KARST OF THE HINDENBURG RANGES damming of passages by mud and debris, and consequent solution during the periods of flood phreas. The various levels of the sumps in the river caves, in Selminum Tem, and in the resurgence cave, show the presence of perched phreas and its step-like character. The section of the Finim Tel caves, however, shows the great extent of former water rest levels (thus ruling out flood and perched phreas). These were probably directly related to old resurgence levels (Figure 4). From the available evidence the following reconstruction of past events has been deduced. (a) In Pliocene times, the overthrust of the Bahrman scarp rose above the sea and the Finim Tel limestone became a marine erosion surface. As uplift progressed, the eroded material from the emerging mountains was deposited to the south as the Birim Formation (Geological Survey of Papua New Guinea, 1974) and a proto- Kaakil River draining the Bahrman shales formed a phreatic conduit to the Stage I resurgence after the marine erosion surface was raised and tilted. (b) Uplifting and tilting of the whole block continued and gave the Stage I cave a reverse gradient. Stage I was rapidly abandoned for the Stage II conduit to a lower resurgence. The new drainage route was much larger than Stage I but whether this was due to a higher rainfall, greater drainage area, or a much longer standstill, is not clear. Yet another fail of resurgence level produced the enormous Selminum Tem trunk route and, towards the end of its development, granodiorite pebbles were washed in. Thus the major glacial event is dated to late Stage III. In response to another fail of base level to Stage IV, the Selminum vadose canyon extended to Monolith Cavern and low level passages were used to bypass the high loops of Stage III. During this time surface lowering had begun to dissect the fossil passages of Stage I. (c) The Finim River pirated a large proportion of the Kaakil headwaters and diverted them into its own cave system, formed as the shales receded towards Mt Fugulil. In Selminum Tem, the lower level mazes enlarged, but the reduced Kaakil finally deserted the great cave and formed Ok Tem, first the upper series and later the vadose canyon. The Kaakil Labyrinth has yet to be rejuvenated by the retreat of the canyon and surface lowering may yet destroy these caves before lower ones are formed. Surface erosion has also dissected the Stage II conduit to create the Trinity and Upper Cave, and the Selminum Doline has breached Stages, I, II, III and IV, probably due to the collapse of a thinning cavern roof. Apart from an abandoned tube 70 m above the present resurgence, there is no direct evidence of lower extensive stages since Stage IV. The last fail in base level has created a confusion of perched phreas, as evidenced by the various levels of sumps in the modern caves. The decreased size of the Kaakil and the rapid fail of the outlet to the base of the limestone explain the phenomenon. Scarp retreat of the Hindenburg Wall, accelerated by earthquakes, must have played a part in lowering base levels, although the amount of debris below the cliff in this region is nothing compared with the vast quantities at Golgobip, where the retreat has been phenomenal. The evidence from the Finim Tel caves indicates rapid but jerky uplift, although not restricted to the Pleistocene (Verstappen, 1964), and further exploration will furnish a more detailed record.

APPENDIX II BIOLOGY PHILIP CHAPMAN Historically, biological interest in caves has been centred in the major karst areas bordering the Adriatic, in south-eastern Europe, the western Mediterranean and in the central and eastern regions of the United States. Tropical caves have not attracted intensive study due to the scarcity of highly specialized cave-limited species (troglobites) which are the most interesting component of cave faunas (Vandel, 1965 and Mitchell, 1969). Probably the most significant factor initiating the evolutionary process which produces troglobites has been climatic change in the Pleistocene. In areas affected by drastic climatic fluctuation, animals which adapted to cave life survived in the more equable microclimate underground, while their surface populations perished or migrated. From the limited information available prior to our departure for Papua New Guinea, it was likely that our prime target areas had suffered at least one climatic deterioration and perhaps more. We therefore expected to find some remarkable animals in any caves explored. The first major discovery came only two weeks after our arrival in Papua New Guinea. A cave, Bem Tem, close to Telefomin had a population of white eyeless</page><page sequence="12">38 CAVES AND KARST OF THE HINDENBURG RANGES nereid polychaete worms?the first known freshwater species of this group. These worms are very ancient troglobites which have successfully adapted from seawater to freshwater, then to cavernicolous life, and finally have survived orogenic uplift of their habitat to its present altitude of 1600 m. Surprisingly, they appear to belong to the genus namanereis and their closest relatives inhabit the Black Sea and the coastal groundwaters of Cuba. Collection of surface animals produced a fairly pre- dictable picture. The insects were dominated by a few families of beetles, notably weevils (curculionidae), staphylinidae and chrysomelidae. Large lucanidae were abundant in rotting logs, together with the larvae of huge cerambycidae and scara- beidae. The spectacularly coloured salticid spiders of the Telefomin area were par? ticularly fascinating. Many of the 60 or so species collected were patterned with brilliant iridescent scale-hairs. Others were remarkably well disguised as ant or beetle mimics. Mimicry and camouflage were most evident in two other groups?the orthoptera (especially the bush crickets), and the phasmids (stick insects). Large phasmids up to 15 cm long were collected, some with bizarre outgrowths of the tegument resembling thorns, leaves or lichens. Groups of particular interest were the dusk-screeching cicadas and the darting dragonflies and damselflies, well suited to a region crowded with marshy pools and streams. The Lepidoptera were another spectacular group, though the birdwing butterflies for which Papua New Guinea is famous do not occur at the high altitude of our study region. The vertebrates provided some surprises. No urodela are found in Papua New Guinea, whereas anura, and in particular the tree-frogs, are very diverse and plenti- ful. Lizards, from tiny geckos to huge, tree-climbing monitors, and a few species of tree-snakes were widespread. A fairly large specimen of the very rare Bolands python was captured, skinned and eaten by our carriers, who unfortunately dis- carded the skin but later gave us an unmistakable description. Of the mammals, various rat species were common, as were phalangers and 'tree kangaroos'. Packs of wild (feral) do^ roamed the Finim Tel plateau and bats (notably rhinolophidae) were found in the caves, together with the occasional colony of impressive flying foxes (pteropus Dobsonia sp). We had no ornithologist on the expedition, since birds are the only well-studied part of the fauna of the Hindenburg Ranges. Many species were observed and nightjars were found nesting in rock shelters. Swifts, using acoustic navigation, nested up to half a kilometre from the entrances of Selminum Tem and their droppings form an important food supply for small cavernicolous invertebrates. The cave fauna of Finim Tel proved to be one of the richest, most fascinating and enigmatic of any region in the tropics. Selminum Tem alone contained seven- teen probable troglobite species, though doubtless many more await discovery. These included a number of unusual species of great interest. A large paradoxo- somatid millipede, the first known troglobite member of its family, was found commonly throughout the deeper flood-liable passages. It appeared to be almost equally at home in air or underwater, seeking refuge in mud cracks during floods and emerging to feed on debris left as the floods receded. Two troglobite harpaline carabid beetles (one apparently closely related to a New Zealand species) were probably cryophilic 'refugees' which colonised the cave during a long Pleistocene cool period (Selminum Tem Stage III to IV?) and were isolated underground by the post-glacial warming of the climate. Another species with an even longer troglobite history was a small isopod, similar to the Mexican troglobite cyathura, belonging to a group (the anthuridae) so far unknown in Melanesia. This crustacean colonized limestone crevices during marine erosion of the Finim Tel prior to major uplift, i.e., before State I (Figure 4). It successfully adapted to freshwater life and has survived an uplift of 2300 m. Other troglobites collected in Selminum Tem included: two millipede species, three collembolans, an aquatic and an amphibious triclad turbel- larian, a linyphiid spider, trombidiid mites, long-legged harvestmen, a woodlouse (oniscoidae), a campodeid diplurian, lumbriculid worms, a leech and a dytiscid beetle. More troglobites were found in Okkemimal in the Ilam valley and, else-</page><page sequence="13">CAVES AND KARST OF THE HINDENBURG RANGES 39 where, cave dwelling crabs were noted carrying Temnocephala scavengers. The crabs had a most remarkable distribution, being restricted to the Finim caves on the Finim Tel but also occurring in the Kaakil resurgence, Agim Tem, the Nohg caves and Tina Bu Tem. Dr. Peter Beron left the main body of the expedition in October to conduct a brief biological survey of cave life in other regions of Papua New Guinea. This journey was most worthwhile and the material collected, notably in Chimbu (another high altitude karst region) and on the Bismark Archipelago (low altitude), should help to interpret the origins of the strange cave fauna of the Hindenburg Ranges (Beron, 1976). The author remained on the Finim Tel plateau during the later stages of the expedition and was able to form a fairly detailed picture of the workings of the troglobite communities of Selminum Tem and surrounding cave systems in relation to the peculiar problems of survival posed by the climate. The Hindenburg mountain region merits further study by a far larger and stronger biological team. Selminum Tem may be just one of many caves of except- ional biospeleological interest in the area. Our expedition has produced material which poses great problems for the zoogeographer in the form of species of a variety of taxa, previously unknown, from the Melanesian side of Wallace's Line and one or two truly bizarre geographical misfits. We hope that our work in Papua New Guinea will arouse the high level of interest among biologists which this little known area so richly merits.

WILDE 'Most of the Telefomin live between 1500 and 1600 m and cultivate taro, the staple crop, up to about 2250 m and hunt to the limit of the ranges' (Craig, 1967). The Telefomin, proper, were first contacted by Europeans in 1927, by Patrol Officer Champion (Champion, 1932), but the headwaters of the Fly River had been visited by Austen as early as 1923 (Austen, 1923), and a number of papers relating to the languages of the area were written by him. A fuller study of the mountain Ok and lowland Ok Families (Telefomin language groups) was carried out by Healy in the mid-1960s (Healy, 1964). The first comparatively detailed cultural observa? tions of the Telefomin area itself were made by Kienzle and Campbell in the late 1930s (Campbell, R. O., 1938). The min people of the Telefomin area claim a common genesis which is centred around a 'culture heroine', known widely as Afek, who is said to have come from an unknown land (Quinlivan, 1954). Apart from being credited with the creation (or agent for creation) of objects required for day-to-day living, she is considered to be the founder of the spirit houses {amemem) which form the centre of the cult activities of each area. 'Religious cult takes the form of secret male ritual directed at growth and garden fertility and is associated with ancestral sacrae.' (Barth, 1971). A central and unique amemem is located at Telefolip, near Telefomin, and draws initiates of the cult from many distant areas and is the binding magico- spiritual force of the min people. Mythologically speaking, Afek is also responsible for the creation of underground routes designed to serve as access to Bagelam, the</page><page sequence="14">40 CAVES AND KARST OF THE HINDENBURG RANGES land of the dead, and the sacred caves/holes or amem-tem which also serve as entrances to the 'road of the dead'. The amem-tem are 'cult houses' designated by Afek to be administered by the spirits. Afek is said to have travelled, mainly underground, from Telefolip to Bultem, and Selminum Tem, a major cave system explored by the expedition, is said to have been part of the route taken by her. Other legends, about cave entrances closing down after people have passed through them, also common to other areas of Papua New Guinea (Wilde, 1975, Parker, 1967); about the souls of the dead manifesting themselves in the form of flying- foxes and an evil female spirit {sanaang aanangen) who is said to have cut a vine rope at Agim Tem, when a party of villagers were descending the cave to hunt flying-foxes; plus the fact that the Faiwolmin people believe that their ancestors emerged from a karst feature on the ranges (Barth, 1971), together with the role of Afek in the creation of caves are all strong evidence for the cultural significance of caves and karst features in the Telefomin area. Art forms such as those appearing on Telefomin war shields, house boards and spirit-house boards, and consisting of abstract animal and anthropomorphic figures carved in relief and painted with red, yellow, orange, black and white (naturally occurring pigments), have been recorded and discussed by Craig (1967) and Cran- stone (1967 and 1968). Similar art forms occur on hand-held drums, bamboo smoking-tubes, arrow shafts and other ornaments and implements. The Australian Star Mountains Expedition, in 1965, was shown a number of interesting anthropo? morphic figures executed in charcoal upon the walls of the amowk (spirit house) at Bufulmin (Hallyer, 1965). Three rock-art sites were recorded by the expedition; at Tem Luun Tem in the Tifalmin Valley, at Selminum Tem (Lower Cave) on the Finim Tel plateau, and at Bileldabam Doline south-west of Selminum Tem. Details of the art forms noted will be found in the expedition's full report. Some 16 ancestral and prehistoric sites were also visited and recorded between the Finim Tel and eastwards to a fault-controlled valley south of Telefomin itself. These sites showed evidence of long periods of use, but no artifactual evidence is available, archaeological study being beyond the scope of the expedition. The sites, however, were recorded in some detail and the results forwarded to the University of Papua New Guinea. As far as the author is aware, there is no record of any archaeological research having been carried out in the area and, therefore, little is known of Telefomin prehistory. The sites recorded were generally rock shelters used for hunting and gathering, or for resting in the course of trading expeditions across the ranges, and permanent or intensive occupation is unlikely. The exceptions are Selminum Tem, upper and lower systems. Two pits approximately 90 cm deep and 50 cm wide were found in the upper system and may have been constructed for use as traps or storage pits. Local mythology says that one of these was Afek's hearth, which she used whilst resting on her way to Bultem. Engravings and paintings, carbon deposits, chert flakes (possibly the product of tool making) and collections of small mammal bones (which may have been the remains of prehistoric hunters' meals) testify to the fairly intensive use of this site. Four man-made excavations were also observed, but their purpose remains an enigma. Evidence suggests that the cave had been entered for at least 120 m, which is well into the zone of permanent darkness but, in the author's opinion, this site was never permanently occupied.
