<plain_text><page sequence="1">PRAGMATISM AND TRUTH.' (II.) FOLLOWING the example of Socrates, who conceived his social function to be that of a midwife, I endeavored in my former lecture to perform this service for pragmatism. Pragmatism holds that the world as conceived by natural science is the expression of human needs. The pragmatism of Dewey and Moore, called instrumentalism, teaches that the conceptions of science are so many instruments for the acquisition of worldly goods. My criticism of the theory endeavored to show that our deepest needs, even in making a practical use of nature, are for intercourse with a fellow; that these needs are implied in the very fact of treating nature as a mechanism; and therefore that pragmatism in its ultimate significance stands for the interpreta- tion of nature from the standpoint of our human motives-in other words, for humanism. At the close of our argument, how- ever, we faced the problem of making a humanistic philosophy true. What if the facts refuse to respond to our needs? May we then simply dismiss any such rebellious item from the world of facts? That, I should hold, in common with most of the critics of pragmatism, is to create an arbitrary distinction between truth and fiction and to make truth a matter of caprice. On the other hand, how may we say that science is both a representation of an independent reality and a fulfilment of our needs-how without assuming a miraculous coincidence between the world and our needs? If truth is always being made, how can it be independently true? These are the questions to be considered in the present lecture. In the last lecture I pointed out that the founder of the humanistic philosophy was Kant. We shall therefore do well to ask how this same problem presented itself to Kant; and we shall see that in the most important points the problem has not 1 The second of two lectures on pragmatism given before the Philosophical Union at the University of California on December 5 and I2, I9I3. The first lecture was printed in the PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW for July, I9I4. 506</page><page sequence="2">PRAGMATISM AND TRUTH. 507 changed from Kant to the present day. The fundamental ques- tion, let us remember, is this: How can I, the knowing person, know an object which is other than myself? Now, Kant's humanism consisted in affirming that I can know nothing except in my own way; nothing can be real for me which does not satisfy my criterion of reality. How, then, shall we adjust the rights of the criterion with those of the reality itself? Kant answered this question by a reconstruction of the ancient Aristotelian distinction of form and matter. The distinction is in general a familiar one. Even our scientific friends are disposed to admit that, while experience contributes the material of facts, it is the scientist who builds them into the form of laws. But Kant's view was not quite so simple as this. According to him the forming process was at work in the very reception of the facts. Positive science assumes that the facts are furnished ready- ordered in relations of space and time, and that the work of the scientist is confined to the determination of cause and effect. According to Kant the scientist is responsible for both processes. That is to say, Kant distinguishes two stages of form, the forms of perception, space and time, and the forms of understanding, or of scientific reason. The real world, the world of things in themselves, is in neither space nor time. It is we who give it a spatial or temporal character in the act of taking it. If, following James, we venture to speak of the "Kantian machine-shop," we shall say that in the factory of science as conceived by Kant, the material supplied by nature is met at the very door by a machine which converts it into an order of facts in space and time. From the space-and-time department the facts, now empirically ordered, are passed to the understanding-room to be recon- structed into an order, let us say, of cause and effect; or, in other words, to be transformed from mere perception of fact into knowl- edge of an objective world. This is a very summary statement; but it may be sufficient to suggest how, in Kant's view, the knower handles the known. But now we face the question, How is the knower so fortunate as to find a material that he can handle? With this question we are in the midst of Kant's difficulties-difficulties which seem to</page><page sequence="3">508 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXIII. have made his thinking ever uneasy and in the solution of which he was never quite clear. As formulated by Kant, the problem of scientific knowledge is to explain how we can make predictions which are afterwards verified. In i846, after many years of work on the part of himself and of others, Leverrier calculated that an unseen planet, afterwards named Neptune, must exist at a certain spot in the heavens, and the astronomers at Berlin, having been notified, directed their telescope to that spot and verified the calculation. How could Leverrier expect that his calculation would be verified? This is Kant's question, to which in his complicated and repeated discussions of the problem he seems to offer two different answers. His first and clearest answer is that such a calculation is bound to be verified because the calculatorhad the conditions of verification all in his own hands. For the ground of the prediction, we must remember, was the form -in other words, the assumption-of an universal law of cause and effect. If the observation failed to verify the prediction it could be put down as false, on the ground that such an observa- tion was opposed to the law of cause and effect; that no planet existed at the given point in the heavens was simply not a fact. Kant's first answer, then, is this: the knower procures verifica- tion for his prediction, or hypothesis, by selecting from the mass of experience the items that would verify and treating only these as facts. In this answer verification is procured by selection. Now, while 'selection' may explain how our predictions are guarded against disproof, it fails to explain how we happen to get the facts that will positively verify. If I step into the hatter's and ask for a certain size of hat, there is nothing strange in the fact that I find it. But it would be indeed strange if I could step into a photograph gallery and find a ready-made photograph of myself. Now, the facts required by science for purposes of verification are like photographs rather than like hats-highly particularized facts. Science is a finely articulated system, in which the facts, if they are to fit at all, must fit exactly. A planet discovered somewhere in the region of the point indi- cated would, strictly speaking, verify nothing; at best it could only suggest an error in calculation. How, then, does it happen</page><page sequence="4">No. 5.] PRAGMATISM AND TRUTH. 509 that even by selection science is able to find the fact that fits? At this point we are referred to Kant's second answer. In the first answer his facts were hard and served only as a basis for selection; in the second they are soft and plastic. Now he tells us that the scientific understanding finds material suited to its purpose because the forms of perception-the forms that put the material into an order of space and time-have already moulded the facts for just this purpose.' In other words, the original material as it first reaches the mind is so indefinitely plastic as to be available for any categories whatsoever. I need not carry the point further. Standing before a block of marble Michael Angelo exclaimed, " I see an angel in the marble." Of course he might just as well have seen a devil. In like manner, according to Kant's second answer-and James gives the same answer-the scientist sees a system in the world. But his system has just the same measure of truth as Michael Angelo's angel. And so Kant leaves us the problem: if the facts of the world are hard, how does it happen that science is able to satisfy its needs? But if the facts of the world are soft, does not the scientist really create a world of science? I have put the question in this form to call your attention to the fact that the problem of the interpretation of science as con- ceived by Kant is still the problem that confronts us to-day. Some years ago M. Le Roy raised the question, Does the scientist create science? And Poincare's Science and Hypothesis, the most brilliant and original contribution in recent years to the theory of science, is an attempt to answer his question. No one who follows Poincare's argument and notes the difficulties into which he has fallen can fail to see that it is Kant's problem again, only at a more advanced stage. The main difference is that in the later discussion Kant's form and matter are replaced by hypothesis and fact. A clearer psy- chology, a psychology enlightened by the conception of evo- lution, has shown that we do not approach our world with 1 See Kant's reply to Eberhard's criticism of the Critique of Pure Reason, quoted and translated by Caird in his Critical Philosophy of Kant, I, 357. Here Kant states that the Critique of Pure Reason asserted a pre-established harmony between sensibility and understanding.</page><page sequence="5">5IO THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXIII. a set of fixed a priori forms, but rather that the work of the scientist is a never-ending activity of forming and reforming hypotheses. It is now reasonably clear that an hypothesis of some sort is represented in every statement of fact. For the matter of that, some particular hypothesis of cause and effect is implied in any ordering of facts in time. Men of science some- times tell us that an order of cause and effect is given with the facts. But you have only to consult a day's experience to see that only in the fewest of that day's happenings do you perceive either cause or effect. Most of them pass without raising the question. Others are of the sort in which you hear your door-bell ring but see no one press the button. You may take the trouble to ascertain from your visitor that he really did press the button; but then you make use of an hypothesis to put his experience in the same order as your own. Often you experience the effect before you experience the cause. But in most cases the cause, or the effect, is simply inferred. When you do experience both it is because your mind is definitely prepared to expect a specific effect-as when you press the button at your neighbor's door and listen for the sound of the bell. I could carry the analysis much further. But the last example will be sufficient to mark the point. For the main difference between scientific investiga- tion and the observations of ordinary life lies only in this: that the scientist makes a more deliberate search for his facts and makes his search with a more definitely formed hypothesis of what he is to expect. Yet at the same time he is suspicious of facts that are discovered as the result of expectation. How, then, are we to conceive the relation between the scientist and his facts-or better, between the scientist and his object? What is it that distinguishes truth from an illusion of expectation and yet responds to the expectation? This is our problem. I may begin, then, by announcing that, in the treatment of the problem, we shall put the natural scientist and his object in the background and study their relations in the light of what at first glance appears to be a totally different situation, namely, the personal relation in which one man deals with another. We shall see, I think, that the same logic rules the two situations.</page><page sequence="6">No. 5.] PRAGMATISM AND TRUTH. 511 But first I must say a word or two to justify this mode of pro- cedure. And first of all I wish to call your attention to the fact that the discussion of knowledge is beset throughout by the crudest sort of metaphor. Not that we can dispense with meta- phor. But it should seem that the philosopher, at least, might be able to handle his metaphors critically, and that he, of all persons, should not forget that his choice of metaphor indicates infallibly his attitude towards his object. The figures applied to knowledge seem to me to be almost without exception vulgar; and intellectually vulgar. Kant's exposition of the relations of form and matter is a constant struggle to escape the consequences of supposing that the human mind is literally a mould intb which experience is being poured. At the same time he is endeavoring to see how a mould can handle a solid and hard fact. More, but not much more, refined is the metaphor implied in holding that the relation of knowledge and fact is a relation of 'one to one correspondence.' Mr. Bertrand Russell reveals the figure when he tells us that this is the sort of correspondence which a cata- logue bears to the things catalogued. The scientist uses the same figure when he speaks of nature as 'a great storehouse of facts '-in other words, as a huge library in which each book has its eternally determined place upon the shelves and of which knowledge is a card-catalogue, a 'one to one correspondence.' Such a correspondence may have various forms; the facts may be catalogued for various needs. But so long as the facts remain hard, eternal, and unalterable, it is always a matter of question whether a given need can be satisfied by even the most ingenious arrangement of the catalogue, and nothing short of a miracle when the needs are as fastidious as those of exact science. In the meantime we do maintain an even finer correspondence with our fellow-man; and yet it is only a caricature to call him either a storehouse of facts or a card-catalogue of ideas. This leads me to a second observation. Our post-Kantian psychology has dispensed with the Kantian moulds and discarded the Kantian machine-shop. It has even here and there suggested that science is an activity of persons. But on the side of the object it has preferred to stick to facts that seem distinctively</page><page sequence="7">5I2 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXIII. hard. When you ask the philosopher for a concrete illustration of the process of knowing, almost invariably he presents you with the case of knowing an inanimate object-preferably a table or a chair; something objective and 'solid.' At best he will com- promise in favor of a green tree. This sort of knowing he con- ceives to be typically 'simple'; and from this sort of knowing he derives his ideas regarding knowledge in general. Now we have just noted that the apparent hardness of these natural facts is the source of all the difficulty. And in the meantime we are not limited in our knowing to the facts that are hard. For the truth is that a great part of our knowledge, and perhaps the most interesting part, is occupied with such relatively flexible and approachable facts as our fellow-men. Let us not forget that, whether or not we love our fellows, we do know them. And perhaps we know them much more intimately than we know the tables and chairs. At any rate, I think that this field of knowl- edge is sufficiently interesting, and sufficiently unexplored, to warrant the question whether a study of the process of knowing our fellows may not throw a new light upon our knowledge of nature. But this introduces a third observation. For as soon as we speak of knowing our fellows, we are confronted with the vast activities of the so-called 'social' sciences, anthropology, psy- chology, sociology, economics, all of which purport to deal with our fellows, and among which economics in particular would seem to rank, in mathematical exactness, with the science of physics. And at first glance this comparison seems to tell us that the knowing of our fellow-man makes no difference in the process of knowing and throws no new light upon the relation between the scientist and his object. For there is perhaps none of the sciences which claims to view its object with so sublime a detach- ment, so complete a divorce between theoretical truth and prac- tical desire, as the science of economics. Among those who deal with the problem of human life no one surpasses the economist in asserting that our conduct is regulated by laws which bid defiance to personal desire. In other words, in economics the object is as hard a fact as it is in physics.</page><page sequence="8">No. 5.] PRAGMATISM AND TRUTH. 5I3 This, however, would seem only to prove my point, namely, that knowledge of our fellows is a higher grade of knowledge. For the truth is that the economist is dealing specifically with those men whom, relatively speaking, he does not know; or, to state the point differently, he is describing the conduct of men in those relations in which they know one another least intimately. In gathering his facts about the world of commerce, the econ- omist prefers to assign a secondary r6le to personal acquaintance and observation in favor of economic statistics. His economic laws describe the conduct, not of Peter or Paul-not of any real or particular person, but only of the average man,-who is always the distant man. For it would never occur to you to conduct a statistical inquiry or to consult a scientific law, to discover whether your wife liked her roast-beef rare or well-done. Nor, in a transaction with a friend concerning a horse or a motor-car, would you care much about the market-prices; the main question would be whether the bargain was mutually satisfactory. But the economist is not interested in a transaction purely personal, whether it be a 'friendly transaction between gentlemen' or primitive barter. It must never be forgotten that economics is both logically and historically the science of modern commerce; of commerce on a large scale, in which the ultimate producer and the ultimate consumer are widely separated. This fact of dis- tance is directly responsible both for the 'scientific' aspect of commercial transactions and for the impersonal character of economic science. The economist describes the distant man. And the economic man, whose actions are determined by eco- nomic laws, is hardly more of a person than the billiard-balls which move in accordance with the laws of mechanics. At best we can say that he holds a half-way position between a person and a thing. I need hardly state the implication. If our human fellows tend to become hard and impersonal facts in proportion as they are distantly known-in proportion as they are known, not as Peter or Paul, but simply as capital or labor, demand or supply-may we not suppose that the impersonal and very hard facts of the physical world are connected with their being still more distantly known? And then must we not</page><page sequence="9">514 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXIII. say that the true type or example of knowing is to be found where one person joins hands-or joins issues, as the case may be- with another and deals with him face to face? At any rate, I propose to examine this personal relation as a type, let us remember, of knowing in general. Among the motives implied in the personal relation, I hold that an indispensably important motive is that of satisfying yourself. In terms of pragmatism, this is the need or the self- interest of the knower. I am aware that the doctrine is un- fashionable; and that the conventional view is that which bids us sacrifice ourselves for the larger good of others. Virtue, which formerly stood for a willingness to be damned for the glory of God, still asks us to be damned for the glory of society. Yet, even from among the most insistent advocates of self-sacrifice, I could summon a cloud of witnesses. Even so 'disinterested' a moralist as Kant finds it necessary to affirm that no moral law can be binding upon me which does not satisfy myself. Every theory of moral obligation refers to some kind of self-interest, however unsubstantial. If God has nothing for me, then I can have no obligation towards him. If my fellow has nothing to say to me, then I can have nothing to say to him. If he cannot interest me, I cannot know him-there is no basis for a personal relation. But now, just because I am bound to satisfy myself, it is indispensably important that I should satisfy my fellow; cer- tainly the fellow from whom I expect a service. I cannot expect him to serve me unless I offer him an inducement. Again, I am aware that many persons will claim that this is quite unnecessary; that I may compel him or deceive him into serving me while leaving his own interests out of consideration. But I think that this view fails to consider the conditions of getting the best that your fellow has to give. From the greater number of our fellows we cannot expect to get the best. To get their best we should have to know them well; and our powers of attention and of imagina- tion, our capacity for life itself is too limited for the task. And if we do not deliberately deceive or coerce them, we at least cheerfully profit by their misfortunes; when a merchant has</page><page sequence="10">No. 5.] PRAGMATISM AND TRUTH. 515 overestimated the market we are ready to buy below cost. But this is all in the direction of the distant economic world. In the world of personal relations it is still true that when I set out deliberately to cultivate one of my fellows and to procure for myself the best that he has to give, I can only enjoy his best by a careful consideration of his needs and by doing my best to satisfy him. This gives us the terms of our problem. In any statement of the situation there are two demands to satisfy, my own and those of my other. In the scientific situation there are two similar terms: the scientist's demand for intelligibility, and his obligation to satisfy the object. Nothing will solve the problem which fails to fulfil both demands. Any mere compromise, however justified by the necessities of immediate action, will fall just so far short of truth. By what process, then, is the solution to be reached? Looking once more at the personal relation, we may see that the ordinary process of solution-and I shall call this the logical and moral process-is a process of bargaining or, if you please, of negotiation. And again I expect to encounter the objection that bargaining is the method of small minds whose object is to get the best of one another. But this, I should say, is the bargaining of the mean and stupid whose imagination is too torpid to demand an exchange of the best that they have to give. Or perhaps it refers to an economic situation in which the only question is a question of price. So far as this is the case there is really no opportunity for a bargain. Bargaining presupposes the possibility of receiving from your fellow an alternative propo- sition in which the demands are, not necessarily lower in amount, but different in kind; in which, for example, I refuse to give you my horse for your cow but may offer you a few sheep. This opens the way for further discussion. And when we look at the matter in this light we see that the conception of a bargain applies to all of our personal relations, from the most material to the most spiritual; and further that a truly satisfactory bargain, in which the demands of both sides are finally fulfilled, is both a triumph of intelligence and a work of art. But truth is precisely such a bargain. When, after a process of experimenta-</page><page sequence="11">5I6 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXIII. tion, you can say, 'This is the positive fact; and this is, moreover, just the fact that my hypothesis demands'-then you have the perfection of truth. Suppose, then, that you have begun by making a demand upon your neighbor, and suppose that your demand has been flatly refused. At this stage you are confronted with what we may call the brute fact. You are in the case of the scientist whose hypothesis has been blankly contradicted. But in dealing with your human fellow-unless he be an economic fellow, a merchant whose price is fixed-you never accept an unwelcome fact as finally and absolutely 'hard.' For such a fact is wholly un- substantial and characterless apart from its motive or meaning. To refuse your son the price of a bicycle may have any of a dozen meanings, from a careful regard for your own pocket-book to a fear of his breaking his neck; and a properly alert lad would treat the refusal only as an invitation to 'try it again.' Hence, you try it again. But here I may remark that, except in the economic world, where prices are fixed, your first offer is not likely to encounter an absolutely flat refusal. It is more likely, for example, that an invitation to luncheon will be declined with the statement from your friend that his work will not permit him to accept an invitation for the middle of the day. Now, if you were not yourself a working man, the statement would excite a feeling of wonder; as if a man should tell you that he never thought of sleeping at night; or the sort of wonder with which astronomers first regarded the spots on the sun. As it is, the statement enables you to interpret the refusal; and at the same time his refusal ceases to be an inflexibly hard fact and becomes a suggestion of a counter-offer: perhaps he would be glad to come to an evening dinner. Or, if this is impossible, then, better still, perhaps he would join you for a Sunday in the country. I need not carry the illustration further. In more important matters a personal negotiation may assume the dimensions of an extended scientific investigation, even with all the advantages afforded by ready communication. What I wish to note here is that the logic of the two processes is the same. The scientific method of trial and error is only another case of negotiation.</page><page sequence="12">No. 5.1 PRAGMATISM AND TRUTH. 517 But in the personal relation the possibility of a new trial, after a first trial has resulted in error, depends wholly upon this: that you may interpret your failure, not as a hard fact, but as a new suggestion, because of the light afforded by your own motives. This important point I shall recall later. Perhaps you may object that all of this refers to practical life rather than to knowledge, to ethics rather than to logic. But one of the great advantages of this personal relation is that it so clearly illustrates the pragmatist's doctrine of the identity of doing and knowing. The process of bargaining seems at first glance to be only a crossing of swords or a trial of strength; but a trial of strength between intelligent men is only another name for the process whereby they arrive at a sympathetic understanding and mutual independence. This trial of strength is the very life of the process even in theoretical knowing. It is no mere accident of literary fashion which puts Plato's philosophy in the form of dialogue; nor does mere imitation account for the fact that others have vainly tried to follow him. The dia- logue is an attempt to present what may properly be called the living truth, or truth in the making; and the art of dialogue is just as fine an art as that of presenting a living form upon canvas. The getting of truth, in other words, is a process of conversation, of question and answer; or, if you please, of dialec- tics. Mere reading of a book will never give you the ideas of the author. You must have a question to ask and a position to defend if you are even to read him. But when you have put your question, then the reading becomes a process of conversa- -tion. The first question brings out an answer and the answer a new question, and so it goes, back and forth, until at last you are able to say where you and your author stand with relation to one another-and the satisfactory determination of this point is truth. With this personal relation now before us, let us note how the logic of the relation fulfils the demands both of the pragmatic theory that truth is always being made and of the realistic theory that truth is independent. First, you must have noted that in the personal relation all is being made-not only the agreement</page><page sequence="13">5I8 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXIII. which constitutes the truth, but the terms between which the agreement is formed, the knower as well as the object of his knowledge. Only in the process of making your object clear do you bring to clearness the needs and demands for which you are ready to stand. In no other way can you arrive at this knowledge of yourself. Suppose that some one asks me, Are you a realist? How do I know if I have never seen a realist? Let me make the acquaintance of Mr. Russell, Mr. George Moore, Mr. Perry, Mr. Montague, or perhaps of Mr. Santayana, and then I shall hope to tell you both whether I am a realist and what kind of a realist I am. Yet in any case I shall try to be an independent realist. For once more I may remind you that the final agreement which we call truth is no mere 'adjustment,' no mere compromise effected by rounding the corners of a square peg to make it fitter for a round hole and at the same time squaring somewhat the shape of the hole. So far as the agreement is a matter of compromise, thus far is it false. And this we must hold to the extent of ad- mitting that truth in its perfection is rarely or never attained. It may indeed be said, then, that in entering a negotiation I cannot yet say precisely what I want; that, for example, I cannot choose my gloves until I have tried them on. It is none the less true that the gloves that I choose are the gloves that I want, and even, if you please, the gloves that I set out to buy. The realism that I adopt is a realism defined after a process of objec- tive investigation. To me the whole question of realism may be more or less new. But it is not my realism unless it reveals itself as the philosophy which I have all the while been seeking. In a word, then, there is no truth unless each party to the trans- action remains true to himself. In a satisfactory agreement both the knower and the object must be independent beings. And since the independence is mutual, let us not forget to mark the independent object. In this personal relation truth is being made; but if I am not made by the object of my knowledge, neither is the object of my knowledge made by me. To Walter Pater, Plato is a lover of beauty, to Mr. Russell he is an abstract realist, to Professor Paul Shorey a man of critical common sense, like</page><page sequence="14">No. 5.] PRAGMATISM AND TRUTH. 519 John Stuart Mill. Plato may (or may not) be any or all of these; and it is certain that Plato has given no finally consistent response to all ways of taking him. Nevertheless, amidst all the variety of response there is a certain unity of personality which is Plato's, and which is not made by the way he is taken. Granting that every fact about a man is a function of the demands made upon him, it is still true that throughout the widest variety of replies he may be personally consistent. He may even realize the Kantian ideal of a consistency equal to that of the law of gravita- tion. So far as he shows any self-consistency whatever, he is an independent being. This brings us to the heart of the problem,-the problem of truth, which, as I have pointed out, is the problem of Kant, of the pragmatists, and of the contemporary logic of science. How can there be a relation of agreement between independent beings? How can truth satisfy human needs and yet have an independent value? How can the work of science be creative and yet a true account of the world? My answer is that the problem is insoluble if the world is presented to us in the form of absolute and hard facts; it is insoluble if we may not interpret the facts as expressions of motives resembling our own. I have pointed out that the process of bargaining, or negotia- tion, by which you come to terms with your fellow, is paralleled in scientific method by the process of trial and error. But the scientific method leaves one important point obscure, namely, when your first trial has resulted in error, or failure, how do you set about trying it again? Upon what ground do you expect better results from another hypothesis, and upon what will a correction of your hypothesis be based? So far as I can see, no answer can be given to this question if the fact that repulsed the first hypothesis was absolutely hard. In that case there is nothing more to be said, and any new hypothesis will be simply a leap in the dark. And yet, in the practice of scientific method new hypotheses are being constantly suggested which come ever nearer the truth. How can this be? In the personal relation the point is quite clear. When your first offer is declined you follow it with a second and better offer which is suggested by</page><page sequence="15">520 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXIII. your neighbor's reply; but the reply suggests nothing whatever except as it may be interpreted through a sympathetic exercise of your own imagination; except, in other words, as you can put yourself in his place. Or again, except as his behavior may be assumed to be, not a set of hard facts, but the expression of motives akin to your own. This is the assumption that succeeds in the knowing of persons. Must we not suppose that, in more obscure fashion, it is the same assumption that succeeds in the field of natural science? If we may not interpret facts by motives then what ground have we for refusing to accept any negative result as final? If we put the question to an empirical scientist, he will doubt- less tell us that his method of getting around a fact is to seek for its cause; and that the cause is discovered by recalling the cir- cumstances by which the fact was attended in past experience. These circumstances supply the suggestion for a new hypothesis. But any attempt to put the method into practice will show that this is more easily said than done. Let us apply it to the personal relation. Suppose that A has declined my invitation to luncheon and that he has done so once or twice before. What in each case were the attendant circumstances? The moment you ask the question you discover that the attendant circumstances were nothing less than the whole sum of activities in the universe at those moments; and further, that, even within your own experience of the universe at those moments, the sum of attendant circumstances was inconceivably vast. It may be, for example, that when A now declines your invitation he is resting the weight of his body mainly upon his right foot. Is it worth while to ask whether this circumstance was common to all his refusals and would therefore explain them? The mere question is suffi- cient to show that an eternity of statistical investigation un- illumined by any suggestion of motive will hardly give you the truth. The empiricist himself will admit that investigation must be guided by a suggestion of probable cause or effect. But what is a probable cause? From an impersonal standpoint one cause is as probable as another. Viewing the universe as a plurality of facts, it is neither probable nor improbable that the sun will</page><page sequence="16">No. 5.] PRAGMATISM AND TRUTH. 521 rise tomorrow. An assertion of probability means that you are interpreting nature in the light of your own point of view, as a coherently motived activity. A probable cause will then be a cause that renders a given effect humanly intelligible. The time is too short for any really adequate discussion of the problem. I shall therefore devote the few minutes remaining at my disposal to what seems to me to be the central question, namely, whether in the logic of science there is any justification for the absolute and hard fact. Remember that I do not deny the existence of facts. A fact, however, as I understand it, is a term of agreement between a knower and his object, an element of achieved truth. Such a fact is a function of the object's being known; it cannot be said to exist before the object is known, just as a question cannot be said to be answered until it has been asked. The facts that I wish to question are those implied in the conception that nature is 'a storehouse of facts '-facts which are supposed not only to exist before they are known but to remain unaltered by the process of knowing. Suppose we ask why the man of science thinks it necessary to hold that the facts of nature are all 'there,' eternally formed and waiting only to be discovered. The answer is obvious. Science must stand for truth rather than fiction; hence the world that is known must be a world of independent beings. But your fellow- man is an independent being; he is independent because, and so far as, his responses to the various demands made upon him are marked by a personal self-consistency. Does scientific truth require any other sort of independence than the independence that you have of me? Yet your fellow-man is in no sense a storehouse of facts. He is not a card-catalogue of ready answers to all possible questions. If that were the case, we should have to wonder how it happens that he is ready for so many questions -just as we do wonder when we find a man whose mind seems to be made up in advance on all possible points. Our wonder shows that we do not expect him to have his answers ready made. In the case of your fellow, then, the facts are all created; co- operatively created; created by him in his reply, created by you in your formulation of the question. In a word, they are</page><page sequence="17">522 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXIII. not facts, but responses. Now, in just the same sense are the facts of science responses; they are created by nature in reply to your hypothesis; and nature, like your fellow, is an independent being, or, better perhaps, a society of independent beings. Upon what ground may it be affirmed that in nature the facts are merely discovered? The man of fact will doubtless tell you that whenever he approaches nature in a given way he gets always the same result-the same fact. By this he means that to obtain the same facts from repeated experiments proves that the facts are always there. But of course it proves nothing of the kind. Apply the test to your fellow: on Wednesday he is a realist; on Thursday he replies, 'Yes, I am still a realist'; yet it does not follow from this that he has dreamed of realism all of Wednesday night. And as a matter of fact neither nature nor your fellow gives the same answer to your question on Thursday that he has given on Wednesday. Nature is not as dull a com- panion as some scientists would have us believe. The truth of the matter is rather that nature never repeats herself. No storm is the precise duplicate of any previous storm, no animal the duplicate of any other animal, no rock the duplicate of another rock. Search the world carefully. You will find, I think, that man the machinist is the only duplicating agent; and in matters of scientific fact, man the laboratory scientist. For in the strict, yet still not the strictest sense, facts repeat themselves only under the careful manipulation of the scientific laboratory, only in response to a carefully formulated 'hypothetical question.' In the laboratory alone is the conservation of energy an eternal and unchanging law. Yet many of your fellows are equally unchang- ing if you take them in the same way. All that you can assert in either case is that you get the same response in reply to the same question. Perhaps, however, your man of science will take his stand upon the accumulation of corroborative evidence in favor of some broadly comprehensive scientific theory, such as the theory of evolution. Perhaps he will claim that the elaborateness and the nicety of the corroboration prove that the order of evolution in nature is an eternal order, irrespective of any hypothesis</page><page sequence="18">No. 5.] PRAGMATISM AND TRUTH. 523 suggested by man; and therefore that the facts of evolution are absolute and hard facts; in other words, that the order of nature is and can be nothing else. To this I should reply that the evi- dence certainly proves that nature is a process of evolution, in the sense that every one who approaches her with an evolu- tionary hypothesis will receive an affirmative reply. And in this sense nature is eternally a process of evolution, as she is also eternally many other things. The experiment by which Newton proved that the light of the sun is a combination of the many prismatic colors (so far as this may be said to be the point proved) would have been just as successful if it had been per- formed by Aristotle. But no amount of articulate coherence in the answer that nature makes to the evolutionist will prove that this is the only answer that nature has to give. It will not prove this any more than the rounded completeness of the Eroica symphony will prove that this is the only symphony that Bee- thoven could write. Nature might still reply with equal definite- ness to some other hypothesis, not less comprehensive than the hypothesis of evolution, the meaning of which is beyond our power to grasp; and her various replies need be none the less consistent. Kant makes this point clear enough when he tells us that the system of nature according to which she is an order of space, time, and causal dependence is only one of the many ways in which nature might be taken; and the logic of the situation admits of nothing else. To claim that our human science is the only way is to commit the crass anthropomorphism of supposing that the powers of nature are limited to those of our human imagination. I have already referred to the various interpretations, all possibly true, that are made of Plato. It seems to me that a natural scientist might well allow to nature both a richer variety of attitudes and a finer consistency than we may expect of even the greatest human being. In conclusion, I will state once more the substance of the argu- ment. At the close of the last lecture I said that the pragmatists had steadily avoided coming to terms with the question of the independence of truth, or reality. Both they and their critics seem to have halted in the presence of the following disjunction:</page><page sequence="19">524 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. either truth is determined solely by our needs-and then how shall we distinguish truth from fiction? or truth is wholly independent of our needs-and then how can it be true for us? As against this I made the claim that truth must be both the satisfaction of our needs and at the same time independent of our needs; and the present lecture was to show how this can be. The answer that I have now given amounts to this: If the facts of science are in themselves absolute and hard, then any agreement what ever between the objects of science and the mind of the scientist is nothing short of miraculous. But if the facts of science are simply the expression of underlying motives, if they are simply responses, like the facts that we get from our fellows, then, while the objects of science remain independent, we may come to agreement with them, just as we come to agreement with our fellows. And then I have endeavored to show that the facts of science are nothing but responses. WARNER FITE. INDIANA UNIVERSITY.</page></plain_text>
