MELVIN AIKENS Dept. of Anthropology, Univ. of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403. This beautifully produced little book is the exhibit catalog for a Utah Museum of Natural History exhibit on the Fremont culture. The museum is the repository for the most ex tensive collections anywhere of Fremont ar chaeological materials, and many interesting and informative specimens are illustrated in the book. David B. Madsen, who by his own testimony has been mystified by the Fremont culture through more than twenty years of study, provides an account of it here that is aimed at a lay audience. The book begins with a synopsis that evokes the variation and diversity of Fremont culture and the landscape in which it grew.</page><page sequence="2">276 JOURNAL OF CALIFORNIA AND GREAT BASIN ANTHROPOLOGY The Fremont range included most of Utah north of the Colorado and Virgin rivers, and adjacent areas of Nevada, Idaho, and Colorado. In the characterization by Madsen, Some people were primarily settled farmers, growing corn, beans and squash along streams at the base of mountain ranges; some were nomads, collecting wild plants and animals to support themselves; still others would shift between these lifestyles. Fremont culture arose out of the Desert Archaic, with the gradual adoption of horticul ture, ceramics, and substantial semi-subterra nean dwellings. The earliest corn known in the Fremont area comes from Elsinore, in central Utah, where radiocarbon dating places it between 2,340 and 1,940 years ago. Pottery and pithouses appeared soon afterward. Madsen describes and illustrates four classes of artifacts which by their distinctive typology set off the Fremont from neighboring Anasazi cultures that were largely contemporaneous, and from the Numic immigrants who replaced the Fremont folk. These artifacts include one-rod-and-bundle coiled basketry, hide moccasins of unique style, thin-walled grayware pottery, and anthropomorphic figures wearing hair bobs and necklaces, that are rendered in both rock art and clay figurines. A chapter on archaeology sketches for the lay reader the bases of archaeological inter pretation, at the same time giving a brief history of efforts by archaeologists to define the Fremont culture beginning with the pio neering 1931 account of Noel Morse. Madsen notes that the question of regional variation in Fremont culture has preoccupied many ar chaeologists, including himself. But in the current presentation he avoids pigeon-holing by simply stressing the diversity of Fremont culture in general, and presenting sketches of sites that illustrate different aspects of the Fremont lifeway. Nawthis Village was a large farming com munity on the southern Wasatch Plateau of central Utah, situated at an elevation of 6,600 feet. Substantial masonry buildings and pit house structures were both in use. Corn, beans, and squash were grown, and pinyon nuts, chenopod seeds, cattails, and Indian rice grass were gathered. Deer, mountain sheep, rabbits, squirrels, and other small animals were hunted. Bull Creek, on the northern flank of the Henry Mountains in east-central Utah, has given evidence of over a hundred small sites, including dwelling places, toolstone quarries, storage areas, temporary camps, rockshelters, and observation points. These were occupied by people who bordered Anasazi puebloan territory to the south, and who used structures and pottery of types traceable to both Fremont and Anasazi traditions. The Orbit Inn site and others like it in far northern Utah, where the Bear River enters the Great Salt Lake, were oriented to rich salt marsh ecosystems that provided marsh plants, waterfowl, fish, shellfish, and even bison. Their occupants dug storage pits, built pole framed structures with slightly excavated floors, and made distinctive slate knives and stone pestles. Hogup Cave, in an arid peninsular moun tain range west of the Great Salt Lake, was occupied by people who manifestly represent ed the more mobile end of the range of Fremont subsistence-settlement patterns. While at Hogup they hunted and gathered on the mountain flanks and along the moist mar gins of the salt flat, and left behind in the dry cave fragments of basketry, worn-out mocca sins, pieces of netting, and many other items in addition to their characteristic grayware pottery. Finally, Topaz Slough, in the Sevier Desert of west-central Utah, gives evidence of many small sites in the open that suggest temporary</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 277 camps occupied by people who came to collect the seeds of desert marsh plants and grasses, and catch the rabbits, small rodents, insects, and lizards of the locality. Professional archaeologists need to write more books of this kind, to convey their re search to the public that supports it. Madsen has appropriately mentioned but not unduly belabored the esoteric concerns of archaeolo gists, while keeping the account descriptive and focused on what is most interesting about prehistoric people, the ways in which they lived in their time and place. The illustrations are plentiful, well-chosen, and beautifully executed. The overall design of the book is elegant. All involved in the Utah Museum of Natural History project that produced this work have done a good thing.</page></plain_text>
