<plain_text><page sequence="1">CALL FOR PAPERS: SPECIAL RESEARCH FORUM BUILDING BRIDGES ACROSS LEVELS Guest Editors: Paul Beamish, Michael Hitt, Susan Jackson, and John Mathieu On the basis of a network analysis of Academy members' divisional memberships, Pearce (2003) expressed concern that the Academy is becoming a bifurcated organization, with the vast majority of members participating in either macro- or micro oriented divisions, but rarely both at the same time. This possibility could be interpreted as a cause for alarm within the Academy's scholarly community. By focusing our attention on narrow subsets of the broad fields of management and organization stud ies, we limit our ability to understand organiza tions as total systems and to conduct research to determine more viable ways of improving them. One of the most frequent recommendations for improving research in the management and organi zational sciences is to build bridges across different levels of theory and analysis so that we might better understand the holistic and interrelated nature of complex organizations: A continuing and frequently stated challenge. . .is to forge a stronger link between the macro and micro parts of the field. ... A focus on only the macro side or only the micro side of the organizational studies coin, as it were, will keep giving us an incomplete and ultimately unsatisfying picture. (Porter, 1996) Despite the historical tradition and contemporary relevance of organizational systems theory, its influ ence is merely metaphorical. The system is sliced into organization, group, and individual levels, each level the province of different disciplines, theories, and approaches. The organization may be an inte grated system, but organizational science is not. (Kozlowski &amp; Klein, 2000) As the field has grown and elaborated new perspec tives, it has continually been threatened with becoming not so much a new integrated semi discipline as a set of independent, self-congratulatory cultures of comprehension. (March, 1996) The strength and comparative advantage of organi zational behavior lies in the diversity of the para digms considered under its big tent. . .our challenge is to transform these differences into greater insight regarding the complexity of organizational behavior. (Rousseau, 2000) Many other scholars have made similar calls for research that crosses disciplinary boundaries and levels of analysis (e.g., see Rousseau, 1985; Cap pelli &amp; Sherer, 1991; Barney, 1992; Hackman, 2003). Nevertheless, empirical research that re flects these views remains scarce. A recent survey of AMJ board members suggests that many Academy members want AMJ to help create the greater insight championed by scholars such as these by encouraging a careful balance? and wherever possible, an integration?of macro and micro perspectives. Academy members look to AMJ and the other Academy journals (AMR, AME, and AMLE) for a broad view of how their own area of specialization contributes to a bigger picture of organizational phenomena. At the same time, they hope to learn how developments in other, related disciplines (e.g., psychology, sociology, economics, political science) contribute to an improved under standing of organization. This special research forum is designed to move us closer to the goal of holistic learning and insight by encouraging research that spans levels of theory and analysis (national, organization, team/unit/group and individual), bridges the subdisciplines within management, and links management research to other disciplines. Our special interest is in bridging macro (e.g., nation, organization) and micro (e.g., subsidiary, group/ team/unit, individual) areas of study. We encour age papers that extend current paradigms by in tegrating macro and micro theories across the subdisciplines of management or between man agement and other disciplines. TYPES OF RESEARCH SOUGHT We expect this special forum to be of interest to scholars from all Academy of Management divi sions. We encourage scholars from different AOM divisions and those who are working at different levels of analysis to engage in cooperative research ventures for this special research forum. We have a special interest in cooperative ventures that result in frame-breaking research. Types of studies sought include (but are not limited to) the following: Research designed to assess whether a particular phenomenon generalizes across individual, group, organizational, and/or national levels (for an example, see Staw, Sandelands &amp; Dutton, 1981), or to determine functional relationships among constructs in the same content domain at different levels of analysis (see Rousseau, 1985; Chan, 1998). 169</page><page sequence="2">170 Academy of Management Journal February Cross-level research in which differences in or ganization-level policies and practices are re lated to differential attitudes, behaviors, and out comes at lower levels (e.g., see Klein, 1980), or where aggregate employee attitudes are shown to relate to organizational outcomes (e.g., see Den nison, 1990). Cross-level research that examines relationships between organization-level phenomena (e.g., firm financial performance) and sublevel phe nomena (employee attitudes) over time (see, e.g., Schneider, Hanges, Smith, &amp; Salvaggio, 2002), thus illuminating causal or interactive processes. Cross-level research that examines relationships between networked organizations or alliance partners and intrafirm phenomena (e.g., Almeida &amp; Phene, 2004; Yamin &amp; Otto, 2004). Cross-level research that examines how differ ences in national cultures and institutional ar rangements influence the dynamics of interfirm (e.g., Gamble, 2003), firm-level (e.g., Hitt, Dacin, Levitas, Arregle, &amp; Borza, 2000), and subsidiary/ affiliate-level phenomena (Makino, Isobe, &amp; Chan, 2004). Case studies of momentous events that illumi nate the cross-level dynamics of organizational change or reactions to crisis (e.g., Dutton &amp; Duk erich, 1991). Innovative studies that apply micro theories to phenomena that have traditionally been exam ined through a macro lens (e.g., Carpenter &amp; Westphal, 2001), or that apply macro theories to lower-level phenomena. These innovative stud ies extend to the integration of micro and macro theories that might change our understanding of micro or macro activities or that might allow us to examine new and important research ques tions regarding behavioral or organizational phenomena. This list is merely suggestive of the range of top ics appropriate for this Special Research Forum on Building Bridges across Levels. Good discussions of cross-level theory and methods and other ideas can be found in Kozlowski and Klein (2000) and in Chen, Mathieu, and Bliese (2004).

If you wish to acknowledge financial support or other assistance, add a note at the bottom of page 1, your title page. Abstract. An abstract of about 75 words and the title of the work go on page 2. Back Pages Group references and any appendixes, tables, and figures at the end of your manuscript. Continue your page numbering. Headings and Sections AMJ uses only three levels of headings. Use boldface for all three. Main headings (all capital letters; centered) are first. Sec ond-level headings (title-style letters; flush left) are next. Third level headings (first letter of first word capitalized; indented; italicized; and run into paragraph) are next. Don't skip steps: no second-level headings before you use a first-level heading for instance. Use second- and third-level headings in sets of two or more. Examples: METHODS Data and Sample Measures Independent variable. Dependent variables. Hypotheses Fully and separately state each hypothesis you tested sep arately. Give it a distinct number (Hypothesis 1) or number letter (Hypothesis la) label. Set hypotheses off in indented blocks, in italic type. Examples: Hypothesis la. Concise writing has a positive relation ship to publication. Hypothesis lb. Following AMJ's "Style Guide for Au thors" has a positive relationship to publication. Language Technical terms. Help your work to be accessible to AMJ's wide-ranging readership. Define key technical terms. A techni cal term is a word or phrase that is not in a general-use dictionary with the meaning you (or even you and other published schol ars) ascribe to it. Putting the first appearance of a word in quo tation marks can replace providing a definition for technical terms that are not key to your work. Example: We noted several instances of "voluntary turnover," but these were outside the focus of this study. Abbreviations. Avoid using abbreviations for the names of concepts. Use ordinary words for variable names?not code names or other abbreviations. Use the same name for a vari able throughout your text, tables, figures, and appendixes. Names of organizations and research instruments may be abbreviated, but give the full name the first time you mention one of these. Names of software and some databases may be abbreviated. Reporting math. Do not "talk in math" in regular text. Use words. For instance, "We surveyed 100 employees," not "We surveyed n = 100 employees" and "We used a chi-square test to evaluate fit," not "We used a \2 test." Do use mathematical symbols and numbers to report illus trative results and give formulas. In both, italicize letters that are customarily italicized, such as p, r, b, F, and Z. Use boldface italic for vectors. Put spaces around equals signs. Illustrative results go in parentheses. The text introducing them should be a complete sentence. Example: One coefficient for the interaction was significant (model 3: ? = 0.06, p &lt; .05; model 5: ? = 1.06). Equations' presentation depends on their appearance and their role in your research. Generally, formulas that aren't key and equations used to estimate regression coefficients should be run into the text. However, formulas that contain oversized symbols or division cannot be run in. These, and some one 175</page><page sequence="8">176 Academy of Management Journal February line equations, should be displayed (centered). If you assign a number to a displayed equation, place it in parentheses, on the far right. Examples: Run-in equation?We used Craig's (1992: 20) distance formula (d = xyz). Displayed equation? [e-MXfXJ*] ?T(Yt = ytxt) =-yxT~9 (1) where Yt is. . . . Your definition of each new term in the equation follows. Sexist or biased language. Avoid language that might be interpreted as denigrating to ethnic or other groups. Be par ticularly careful in dealing with gender, where long-estab lished customs, such as the use of "he" as a generic pronoun ("a manager . .. he"), can imply gender-based discrimination. Using plural pronouns?changing "the manager . . . he" to "managers . . . they"?usually helps. Active voice and first person. Put sentences in the active voice ("I did it"; "They did it") instead of the passive voice ("It was done") to make it easy for readers to see who did what. Use the first person ("I" or "we") to describe what you, or you and your coauthors, did. Examples: Passive (less desirable)?Two items were found to lack factor validity by Earley (1989). Active (more desirable)?Earley (1989) found that two items lacked factor validity. Third person (less desirable)?The author developed three new items. First person (more desirable)?I developed three new items. Anthropomorphism. Avoid describing inanimate entities (models, theories, firms, and so forth) as acting in ways only humans can act. Appendixes Present long but essential methodological details, such as explanations of the calculation of measures, in an appendix or appendixes. Presentation should be concise. If you can, avoid table formats and exact reproductions of surveys. Lists with headings are fine. Look at published AMJs for models. Label multiple appendixes "APPENDIX A," "APPENDIX B," and so forth. A substantive title, such as "Items in Scales," should follow. Label tables within appendixes "Table Al," "Bl," and so forth. Tables and Figures Useful tables and figures do not duplicate the text or each other. Please carefully consider what each table or figure adds to your work. Look at tables and figures in published issues of AMJ to get ideas for preferred formats. For each table or figure, center "TABLE" or "FIGURE" with a number ("1," "2," etc.) at the top of the page. Put the title under this, also centered and in boldface type, but in title style letters (upper and lower case). Number tables and figures consecutively (one series for tables, one for figures). Place tables and figures at the end of the manuscript, but indicate the position of each in the text as follows: Insert Table 2 about here Each table or figure must have a sentence in your text that introduces it. More on tables. Use more than one page if needed to achieve a neat, readable presentation. Please do not squeeze material onto one page by shrinking type or using abbrevia tions. Spell out the names of your variables. Don't use code names and abbreviations. Example: Desirable variable name?Profitability Undesirable variable name?PRFT Each table should report one type of analysis (which is identified in the title), and each vertical column and horizon tal row should contain only one type of data. Label the data across the top or down the far-left side?not in the body. The body of your table should contain only data. In general, give ages and percentages as whole numbers, and report only two decimal places for all statistics. Place correlation coefficients in the lower-left corners of their tables. For general footnotes to tables, use superscript small let ters. A lettered footnote may be used to summarize signifi cance levels: a All values greater than ... are significant at. . . . To report significance levels one-by-one, indent separate footnotes under all your other footnotes. Use asterisks. Exam ple: *p &lt; .05 **p &lt; .01 Unless you are reporting exact probabilities, keep to two lev els of significance. In all cases, use a single asterisk for the .05 level. More on figures. Figures (unlike tables) have graphics. If possible, our printer scans figures directly from the hard copy of your manuscript into the publication files. So make sure your figures will print out clearly. Place all words horizontally?avoid setting words parallel to your y-axis in a graph, and avoid vertical stacks of letters. Use the same full (not abbreviated) variable names you use in the text and tables. Citations Formal citations. These are your in-text, in parentheses, identifications of other research. Every work that has a cita tion needs to have a corresponding reference (see "Refer ences," below). Examples: Name and year?Several studies (Adams, 1994; Bern stein, 1988, 1992; Celias, 2000a, 2000b) support this conclusion. Year only?But Van Dorn and Xavier (2001) presented conflicting evidence. Order. Order citations alphabetically. Designate two or more works by one author (or by an identical group of authors) published in the same year by adding "a," "b," and so forth, after the year. See the "name and year" example just given. Multiple authors. If a work has two authors, give both names every time you cite it. For three through six authors, give all names the first time, then use "et al." in citations. Examples: First citation?Few field studies use random assignment (Foster, Whittington, Tucker, Homer, Hubbard, &amp; Grimm, 2000).</page><page sequence="9">Subsequent citations?. . . even when random assign ment is not possible (Foster et al., 2000). For seven or more authors, use "et al." even for the first citation. (But the corresponding reference should give all the names.) Page numbers. To cite a direct quotation in running text, give its page after the year, separated from it by a space and a colon. Example: In-text quotation?Lee has said that writing a book is "a long and arduous task" (1998: 3). No author? For an article with no author, cite the periodi cal as author. Example: Periodical as author?Analysts predicted an increase in service jobs [Wall Street Journal, 1999). For reports, handbooks, and the like, cite the "corporate au thor" that produced them. Example: Organization as author?Analysts predict an increase in service jobs in the U.S. Industrial Outlook (U.S. Depart ment of Commerce, 1992). Such sources can also be identified informally. No corre sponding reference will then be needed. Example: Informal citation?According to the 1999 U.S. Industrial Outlook, published by the U.S. Department of Com merce, service jobs will increase. Electronic sources. Use a regular citation (author, year) if you can identify an author of one of the types discussed above (human, periodical, or corporate). If not, give the Web address that was your source in parentheses. No corresponding refer ence need be used in the latter case. References References are your entries in the alphabetical list at the end of your article or research note. This list should include only work you have cited. Order. Alphabetize references by the last name of a sole author, a first author, or an editor, or by the name of a corpo rate author (for instance, U.S. Census Bureau) or periodical (such as the Wall Street Journal) if there is no human author or editor. Order works by an identical author by year of publication, listing the earliest first. If the years of publication are also the same, differentiate entries by adding small letters ("a," "b," etc.) after the years. Repeat the author's name for each entry. Books. Follow this form: Last names, initials (separated by a space). Year. Title (Boldface italic, capitalize only the first letter of the first word and of the first word after a long dash or colon.) City where published: Name of publisher. (For small U.S. and Canadian cities, follow the name of the city with the postal abbreviation for the state or province; for small cities in other countries, give the full name of the country.) Examples: Granovetter, M. S. 1965. Getting a job: A study of contracts and careers. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. Kahn, R. L., &amp; Boulding, E. (Eds.). 1964. Power and conflict in organizations. Glencoe, IL: Free Press. Katz, D., &amp; Kahn, R. L. 1978. The social psychology of orga nizations (2nd ed.). New York: Wiley. National Center for Education Statistics. 1992. Digest of ed ucation statistics. Washington DC: National Center for Education Statistics. Periodicals. Follow this form: Authors' last names, initials. Year. Title (regular type; same single-capital rule as for books). Name of Periodical (boldface italic, title-style capitalization), volume number (issue number, if needed?see below): page numbers.
