In the first place, the editor has expressly requested that I state some theological convictions which I hold per- sonally, in order to make this interchange of thought as pointed and concrete as possible. If, therefore, the first personal pronoun crops out on occasion, I hope I may not be accused of wanton exhibi- tionism. I am merely trying to follow in- structions. In the second place, by social inherit- ance and, I hope, by personal conviction I stand within the Christian tradition. It follows inevitably, therefore, that I shall make some assumptions which are unacceptable to members of other tradi- tions. For these other traditions I have the highest respect, but I do not happen to belong to them. In the third place, it will be readily ap- parent that I am not a professional the- ologian. The discussion which follows will embody a minimum of technical the- ological language; it will blur some dis- tinctions which a more competent the- ologian would discriminate nicely; and it would probably be regarded as hope- * Dr. Nevin C.

Our purpose is to explore some of the tenets of a certain theological position and to suggest in each case some of the practical implications for religious educa- tion of these respective tenets. I. God is a Person, who is both within and beyond the created universe.-Almost everyone believes in Something within and perhaps behind the phenomenal world. It may be a law (or system of laws), a principle, a force, a tendency- there are many ways of conceiving it. The evidence is all in favor of such a hypothesis. The beauty of our universe, its majestic orderliness, the incredible adaptation of part to part, the marvel and mystery apparent within us and about us, the sure evolutionary unfolding from one level of being to another are simply too overwhelming to permit any other conclusion in the minds of most observers. But for me this Something is a Some- one. I cannot, of course, prove this. But it is more satisfactory both to my re- ligious life and to my intellect to ascribe full-blown personality to God. For other- wise God would be lower in the scale of being than I am, and that is a conclusion difficult to accept. Perhaps it is merely our anthropomorphic arrogance, but we commonly take personality as the high- est descriptive category. But I am a per- son, belonging with countless others to this top category of description and ex- planation. If God is catalogued at any I90</page><page sequence="2">SYMPOSIUM ON RELIGIOUS EDUCATION lower point in the scale of being, then he is less than I am. Furthermore, the uni- verse has brought forth something higher than itself. The end-product of the evolu- tionary process is superior to its point of origin. Water has risen above its source. Since all this seems so inconceivable and impossible, I find myself led to the con- clusion that God is at least personal. He can do all I can do, and infinitely more besides. Wherein he diverges from the personal, the divergence is in the direc- tion of the suprapersonal rather than the subpersonal. Mere naturalism, then, is not acceptable to me either religiously or intellectually. I have the highest regard for sincere naturalists. I know some per- sonally who are far better and abler men than I am. But I cannot go with them in their conception of the nature of ultimate reality. This personal God is both within and beyond his created universe, both im- manent and transcendent. Such a dual relationship to the infinitely complex realm of being is not easy to imagine. Perhaps we can derive some help from recourse to a human person and then pro- ceed by analogy from the microcosm to the macrocosm. There can be no doubt that I am immanent in my body. This biological structure, so intricately and wonderfully made and yet so feeble and fragile, is the locus of my personal life. When it goes down the street, I go along. Where it is, I am. Touch any part of it, and I feel it-even to bone and finger- nail. Through this body I express myself. It is the agent of my personality, through which I go where I want to go and do what I want to do. And yet I am more than my body. If this is not true, then I am grossly deceived. I am not merely an assortment of nerves, glands, muscles, bones, and organs; nor yet a system of biological and neurological laws, or a bundle of forces, or an energy system. Somehow and somewhere I come to a focus of consciousness. I know that I am. I know that I am I. I can look "down" upon my body in objective semidetach- ment. I can direct it to go here, and it goes; or there, and it obeys. If these ele- mentary data of my own self-awareness are not true, then I am not sure of know- ing any truth at all. But if this is possible for me, why not for God? On the one hand, he is omni- present throughout his creation, and everywhere at work. His is the energy which brings the bud to flower, the child to manhood, and the tribe to a society eventually world wide. His will is the law which governs all growth and change. Touch any part of his creation, and you touch him. The realm of phenomena is his body, within which he dwells, closer to each of us than breathing and nearer than hands and feet. And yet there is no a priori reason for concluding that he is a prisoner within his universe, shackled within soil and water, sun and stars, atoms and the nexus of human history. Perhaps he, too, somehow and some- where, comes to a focus of self-conscious- ness. Then he is able to look "down" upon this and all other imaginable uni- verses in a measure of objective detach- ment and with a transcendence which is both psychological and moral. He both knows that he is and knows that he is God. Why should I hesitate to ascribe to God a capacity which I find in myself as a primary datum of experience? Such a point of view is at variance with both naturalism and neo-orthodox super- naturalism. The former stresses God's im- manence to the loss of his transcendence. The latter stresses his transcendence to the neglect and sometimes to the loss of his immanence. Here would seem to lie the major issue of contemporary theology. I9I</page><page sequence="3">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION The stand which a person takes on this matter, either at one of the extremes or somewhere in between, will be determi- native of his view not only of God but also of man and history and religious education. The implications for religious educa- tion of the position here taken are not hard to find. The most obvious runs in this fashion: in our work with growing persons it is at least as important to cul- tivate right relations with God as with fellow human beings. These two lines of relationship cannot, of course, be sepa- rated even for a moment. In a myriad ways which we only half-understand they play into each other, and the strengthening of the one reinforces the other also. Butwe have sometimes falsely emphasized one to the slighting of the other. It would seem that the neglected relationship in recent religious educa- tional theory has been the Godward rela- tionship. Perhaps the reason is precisely a weakened sense of personality in God. If he is truly a Person, the primordial Person, the personality-prototype of the universe, the Author of our lives and the Controller of destiny, then he cannot well be ignored. To attempt to do so is like standing on the edge of the Grand Canyon and overlooking the Grand Canyon. In practical terms, this means a de- liberate effort in our program of religious education to foster the Godward rela- tionship. This in turn requires abundant contacts with God's world and God's people at every successive age level, a patient interpretation of these contacts in terms of God, the opportunity to come around again and again to hard wrestling with the concept of God, a careful cul- tivation of the devotional life until prayer is meaningful intercourse with him whom not having seen we love, and considerable emphasis on corporate wor- ship which is relevant to ongoing life but definitely oriented Godward. It requires also, as we shall note later, a vital ac- quaintance with individuals and groups in the past who have had outstanding success in penetrating the veil between the seen and the unseen, in order that we may learn from them all they have to teach us. There are other implications as well which may be suggested briefly. Such a conception of God as has been outlined contains enough of God's immanence to give us faith in the ordinary life-proc- esses as carriers of the divine will and energy. It enables us to trust the laws of individual and social growth and impels us to pay much attention to family, gang, community, and other social group- ings. On the other hand, such a concep- tion makes enough of God's transcend- ence to humble us and save us from an overweening sense of our own impor- tance. We are very little, and God is very great. We are weak, and he is strong. We inhabit time, but he dwells in eternity. His sea is large, and our boats are small. At the very moment we think we are ac- complishing the most, we are only allow- ing divine energies and purposes to work through us. As Paul put it, "Work out your own salvation with fear and trem- bling; for it is God who worketh in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure." These verses deserve to be the golden text of religious education. 2. Jesus is the prime revealer of God's nature and will.-Such a God as has been depicted would want to make himself known, both for his own sake and for the sake of mankind. If God is a Person, it would be abhorrent to him to live in a social vacuum, unknown and unloved. Such a state of affairs is incompatible with all personal life, human or divine. I92</page><page sequence="4">SYMPOSIUM ON RELIGIOUS EDUCATION And no more could he contemplate with equanimity a situation in which his chil- dren were kept in permanent and total ignorance of his nature and his ways. In other words, revelation is an inescapable function of a personal God. All this implies "no angel-visitant, no opening skies." Since God is immanent, as well as transcendent, he has left abundant clues concerning the divine nature and purpose scattered throughout the structure of things, the phenomenal screen which lies between our spirits and his. These clues are there for all to dis- cern. They are not thrust forcibly upon our attention, since God respects us as persons and does not compel us either to learn or to heed what he would fain teach us. But how anxious he must be to have us stumble upon the hints of everlasting truth which are strewn along our path- way! How he must rejoice when we pick them up, and make sense of them! And how he must grieve when in our igno- rance and wilfulness we pass them by time and time again and refuse to learn! It is plausible to believe that -God watched eagerly for the successive gener- ations of mankind to "discover" elec- tricity and that he rejoiced when Ben- jamin Franklin began to discern the meaning of his experience with a kite, a string, and a piece of metal. So it must be in the moral and the spiritual realm also. We may call it human discovery, if we wish; or we may term it that God is at least as anxious to have his truth discov- ered as we are to discover it. What we have described thus far is by the theologians called "general revela- tion," the unveiling which takes place al- ways and everywhere in nature and histo- ry and every facet of life. But the term "special revelation" also has meaning to me-a revelation not different in kind but qualitatively superior to that which is going on always and everywhere. The pages of history tell the story of an other- wise undistinguished people, the He- brews, who seem to have developed in the course of their experience an unusual sen- sitivity to the things of the spirit. And among them were outstanding individ- uals who were hypersensitive; we com- monly call them "prophets." And there was one who in the judgment of a large part of mankind was most sensitive of all, Jesus of Nazareth. Indeed, he seems to have lived in such close and consistent communion with God as to realize iden- tity with the divine nature. Every now and then we see a son who is so close to his father as to be virtually identical with him at a number of crucial points- following the same vocation, pursuing the same purposes, caring for the same values, manifesting the same spirit. If we have known the father in years gone by, and now meet the son after the lapse of many years, we may indeed say, "I thought it was his father over again." There is good reason to believe that it was so with Jesus and God. So close was this spiritual kinship that those who walked and talked with Jesus gradually awoke with a start to the conviction that more than man had been walking and talking with them. In Jesus' love for people, they were in fact witnessing the love of God. In Jesus' system of values, they were glimpsing the values which have lain at the heart of reality since the morning stars sang together. In Jesus' purposes, they were detecting the very goals for which the Almighty himself la- bors. In Jesus' suffering on the cross, they were peering into the very heart of God as he suffers for and with a wayward and distraught humanity. I confess that I have some difficulty with such neo-orthodox phrases as "the mighty acts of God performed in human I93</page><page sequence="5">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION history," as though God in contravention of the normal processes of life had in- serted the Hebrew people, and Jesus, and the church into history by divine fiat. (It may be that this is not what they mean at all, but such are the overtones I some- times catch.) But I can repeat with full assent and deep gratitude such a verse as this: "And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us(and we beheld his glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father), full of grace and truth." Or this one: "God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself." In Jesus Christ- his teachings, his life, his death-is made most clear the love that will not let men go, which alone in the final analysis can avail to recall us from our errant ways to him whose will is our peace. This assessment of the significance of Jesus implies nothing one way or the other concerning the virgin birth, the pre-existence of Christ, his miraculous powers, or his physical resurrection. Rather it is a simple value-judgment, an appraisal of worth and of meaning which can never be proved but which is not necessarily therefore false. It embodies the conviction that Jesus is to me the supreme revelation of God and that I look for nothing better. If God is a Per- son, what better vehicle could there be for conveying his true nature than a hu- man personality? And what human per- sonality is better for this purpose than the person of Jesus? One may search in vain the roster of the founders of other world religions, as well as the great spir- itual giants, secular and religious, within our own Western tradition; none of them match Jesus in spiritual grandeur. I have a deep admiration for Lao-tse, but he ran away when the going got rough. Jesus, on the contrary, "steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem." Francis of Assisi was a personality of transparent grace and beauty, but there is a blot on his young manhood from which Jesus is free. Both Lao-tse and Francis, and many others, tell me something concerning ultimate reality, but Jesus most of all. I conclude, therefore, that as much of God was in Jesus as can abide in a human organism. Or, to say it differently, when we wish to make a conjecture concerning the nature of the unknown, we begin with the high- est we know. And that, to me, is Jesus Christ. The Bible is the literary record of these events and personages and experi- ences in which God is made known in unusual and supreme degree. Such a statement carries no suggestion of any theories of literal inspiration or verbal in- errancy. The Bible is often repetitious, sometimes inaccurate, frequently self- contradictory (except that when the sev- eral strands are arranged in their proper chronological order the successive levels of discernment begin to assume a devel- opmental pattern), and permeated throughout by the prescientific world view which was current during the cen- turies in which it was written. It is a hu- man document, the product of fallible minds and spirits. But in this earthly vessel a heavenly treasure is contained- the Word of God to man in a peculiar and unique sense. Through it God can speak to us and to our children, if we have ears to hear. The chief implication for religious edu- cation of this line of thought is that con- tent has a vital role to play in religious growth. The person-centered philosophy of education has sometimes operated to the relative neglect of content. But it must not be allowed to do so. After all, individual growth never takes place in a vacuum but rather in living touch with the realities of contemporary life, as well as the richest deposits that have come down to us out of the past. If we approach the matter in terms of I94</page><page sequence="6">SYMPOSIUM ON RELIGIOUS EDUCATION the philosophy of education, it is a tru- ism that no present-day learner can ade- quately solve his problems, answer his questions, or meet his life-situations by a purely extemporaneous attack upon them. If he merely sits down at a fork in the road and cogitates, he may not get very far. So many other people have traveled this same road, and thought and discovered so many things relevant to his own life, that he is well advised to take this accumulated body of insight and ex- perience into serious account. Our re- ligious educational theory has recognized this clearly, even the most modern and progressive phases of it. For example, no one has made a more satisfactory state- ment of the place of subject matter in learning than Professor William Clayton Bower. But in actual practice, we have not succeeded too well in integrating his- toric content into the process of present learning. At least we seem to have raised up a generation of religious illiterates, who do not know enough about what has gone before to be of any substantial help to them in the living present. If we approach this matter in terms of religion, the significance of content is equally clear. If there have been places where God and man have drawn close to each other, where human insight has been keenest, where divine revelation has been clearest, where eternal truth has crystallized within our human experience most unmistakably-then in all con- science it would seem that the present- day learner ought to know about it. Otherwise, he is hobbled and hamstrung in his efforts to knowledge of the tables, the formulas, and the laws painstak- ingly pieced together by those who have anticipated him in his quest. He may get where he wants to go, but a lifetime is scarcely long enough for the journey unaided. This plea on behalf of content is not meant at all to suggest a content-cen- tered curriculum, heavy with the lifeless accumulations of the dead past. God is by no means to be found in the past alone, and the present growing edge of experience is never to be minimized. It implies no easy disregard of the learner's level of ability, or interest, or need. All content must be introduced functionally into the stream of life and learning, slipping in at the time and in the manner in which it will do the learner most good. It is merely intended to make the point that the Bible, church history, mission- ary narrative, religious biography, sym- bolism, art, architecture, etc., have a highly significant part to play in setting forward the spiritual growth of a learner. The new curriculums of several major de- nominations are making strenuous efforts to give a larger place than heretofore to content of this sort. Whether they are going at it in the right way or not remains to be seen. But it is worth doing, and we must continue our search for the best way of accomplishing it. 3. Man is both a child of God and a sinner.-To begin with, man is a child of God. This is the primary fact about him. He is not a mere adaptive mechanism or a biological organism raised to a slightly higher degree than the other animals. He is both of these, to be sure; but these af- firmations fall short of the deepest truth concerning him. He is a child of the Most High. The stamp of the imago dei rests upon him. Within limits he can think God's thoughts after him. He can enter into sympathetic relations with other persons, "feeling with" them in their joys and sorrows as God does. He can identify himself with the long-range purposes of the Eternal and make those purposes his own so that his spirit rises when they pre- vail and falls when they go down in tem- porary defeat. As a child of God, man is of infinite I95</page><page sequence="7">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION capacity and of infinite worth. Perhaps it is better to say, as contemporary theol- ogy frequently does, that this great worth is not underived. It is an endow- ment from his Creator rather than an in- herent property of his being. But, at all events, the only phrase which properly describes the value of man is "ceiling unlimited." A person has no right to treat himself or anyone else in any other way than befits a son or daughter of God. The whole material universe and every social system must remain subordinate to the welfare of individual persons. Whenever we reverse this order of prece- dence, there is trouble ahead. But this is not the whole story. Man is also a sinner. In religious-education circles we have tended to fight shy of the word "sin."But when the reality and the awful consequences of it are so tragically obvious wherever we look, we surely should not shun the word any longer. It is only because man is a child of God that he has the possibility of being a sinner. A machine cannot leave the father's house or choose to thwart the father's will. A slave may run away, but he does not break the father's heart by so doing. Only a child can sever the filial relation- ship. Or, to put the same thing in other and less religious language, it is precisely the high potentialities of human nature which open the way to its downfall. A human being, for example, can enter into a love relationship with another which so far transcends in beauty and dignity the chance mating of animals that it seems almost sacrilege to combine the two in the same sentence. But, by the same token, it is precisely the same distinc- tively human capacities which make pos- sible a sexual degradation in the human species which no self-respecting horse would countenance for a moment. The freedom with which we are endowed, our ability to remember the past and project ourselves into the future, our self-con- scious transcendence of ourselves-these open the way for us to rise very high or to sink very low. And, as the Negro spirit- ual so truly says, we are "sometimes up and sometimes down." This dual description of man departs from both the unwarranted optimism of the I920's and theunwarranted pessimism of the I930's. In the heyday of American liberalism we magnified the immanence of God and (what always goes hand in hand therewith) the innate goodness of man. The effects upon religious education were very great. Then, in the debacle and disillusionment of the I930's, we magni- fied the transcendence of God and the in- herent sinfulness of man. If this tendency is carried to its logical limits, religious education simply ceases to exist. The truth would seem to lie somewhere in be- tween. This portrait of human nature involves at least two far-reaching corollaries in the realm of religious education. The first af- firmation-namely, man's dignity as a child of God-offers a sound theological undergirding for a person-centered pro- gram of religious nurture. Persons must be our major concern, just as they are God's concern. They alone are ends in themselves. Everything else-books, tra- ditions, institutions, doctrinal formula- tions-is only a means to an end. Our program, therefore, must center in per- sons both in theory and in practice. Our objectives are to be phrased in terms of personal growth and fulfilment. This is true to the spirit of Jesus. He himself de- fined the objective of his ministry in terms of persons: "I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly." It is true also, as we have noted, to God himself. If we endeavor to construct a Christ-centered program of religious edu- I96</page><page sequence="8">SYMPOSIUM ON RELIGIOUS EDUCATION cation, as some advocate, when we face toward Jesus we find him facing toward persons. And if we orient our program Godward, we come out at the same point and for the same reason. The content of our program likewise takes its major course and sequence from the needs, the interests, and the life-situations of the ongoing life of persons. A Bible-centered program is not satisfactory; for it can be truly said that the Bible exists for man, while the obverse cannot be said. A church-centered program is not satisfac- tory; for we can conceive of the church existing for man, but we cannot invert this relationship. Only a person-centered program is sound both educationally and theologically. We shall make much of God and Jesus, of the Bible and the church, but always to the end of per- sonal growth and in the manner best suited to such growth. The second affirmation-namely, man's propensity to sin-should lead us to a methodology which is realistic in its appraisal of human nature. In this con- nection, consider the discussion method, for example. It is a most useful methodo- logical tool, which should be employed much more widely than it is at present. But let us not deceive ourselves! Human nature being what it is, neither children nor youth nor adults will do good group thinking without grist for their mill in the form of data, principles, and insights which have been bought with a price and which they must master at the cost of hard effort. More to our present point, they are altogether likely to evade the real problems of their personal lives and of society around them. They are prone to use their intellectual powers to come out where they want to come out and to justify what they want to do. They may seize upon the chance of free discussion to get themselves into the limelight rather than to pursue objective truth. Sin in its broadest sense invades and in- fects the discussion method as it does everything else. Or consider the project method, which proceeds by catching people up in purposeful activities. Both secular and religious education have been greatly enriched by Kilpatrick and Shaver, pioneers in the project method. But again let us not be deceived! Human nature does not in- variably and irrepressibly throw itself into constructive activities for the com- mon good. When it does, it may get tired before it reaches the finish line. And it may turn the whole business into an oc- casion for subtle personal aggrandize- ment. A romantic version of human na- ture can vitiate our best efforts and ren- der them worse than futile. If persons are the primary stuff with which we work in religious education, it is essential to ap- praise accurately our basic materials. 4. The church is the body of Christ.- Lest I be misunderstood, I should hasten to say that I am not a high churchman. At least I would not be accepted as such in many circles. I have a gnawing fear that the present exaltation of the church, which has pervaded American Protestant thought since the ecumenical conferences at Oxford and Edinburgh in 1937, will go too far and involve us in the kind of ec- clesiasticism against which Jesus had to protest so strenuously. The church is not an end in itself but a means to an end. It is only a relative value, while the King- dom of God is an absolute value. Nevertheless, the most meaningful metaphor I can find for speaking of the church is as old as I Corinthians-the body of Christ. The church is a body, an organism possessing many members. As such it is grossly imperfect. The pages of its history are marred by petty jealous- ies, official self-seeking, lukewarmness, I97</page><page sequence="9">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION provincialism, obscurantism, and social blindness and cowardice. Like any other body, it is a halting, groping affair. But the spirit which informs it is the spirit of Jesus, and with that I can find no fault. Therein lies its uniqueness and its abid- ing glory. The church is best conceived as the sociological extension in time and space of the life and spirit of Jesus. It derives from him. Even now it is only sixty generations away from him. Its charter is to continue to do his work, serve his purposes, and conserve his spirit. Viewed in this light, the church is a unique institution. There is no other like it. It has existed longer, and meant more to more people, and effected more strik- ing changes in society than any other in- stitution. Of all the forces in Nazi Ger- many, it alone mustered the spiritual vitality to offer some real resistance to totalitarianism-not the vaunted Ger- man universities or the labor movement, but the church. Of all the international associations present in the world when the late war split humanity asunder, only the church kept some measure of com- munication alive across the hostile lines of division-not the fraternity of science or of art but of religion. It may not be presumptuous, then, to believe that the church holds a peculiar position in the divine strategy. If Jesus occupied such a place, so does the church -the projection of his spirit and work. The church thus becomes more than a mere man-made institution, a voluntary assembly of believers and well-doers. It is a divine-human institution (as all good things are). God also has a stake and a hand in it. Here in this society within society each new member stands at least some chance of coming into organic touch with the spirit of him who is the head and the life of the church. Here is a particularly good place for God to get at men and for men to apprehend God. Or, to say the same thing in the traditional language of theology, the church is a means of grace. Here the individual's own life is nurtured, and from here as a base he moves out to play his proper part in the world and to bring all life into closer harmony with the divine inten- tion. If this interpretation of the church is at all tenable, the practical implication follows that one of the best services re- ligious education can render present-day disciples or learners is to help them be- come true members of the church. If we can lead them to vital incorporation with- in the church until its life-stream flows through them and their own lives in turn serve to strengthen it, something decisive has happened to them for their good. In specific terms, this means enough deliber- ate instruction in church-school or church-membership classes to enable them to know its glorious history and its present program, to appreciate it fully, and to criticize it wherever it falls short of its high calling. But more than this is needed. There must be careful attention to grading, the formation of natural homogeneous groups in which the indi- vidual can achieve status and have a sat- isfying social experience. Almost any parent will testify that he is happy in- deed if an adolescent boy or girl comes to regard a church group as his or her gang. A way must be found also to enable chil- dren and youth to participate actively, meaningfully, and happily in whatever the church does-its worship, its work, and its play. And, finally, each individual sooner or later should be brought face to face, quietly but squarely, with the ne- cessity of deciding whether or not to cast his lot with the church and its Lord and all that they stand for. I98</page><page sequence="10">SYMPOSIUM ON RELIGIOUS EDUCATION 5. The Kingdom of God is the goal and destiny of human history.-By the phrase, "the Kingdom of God," let us mean a regime in which God's rule in the hearts, the lives, and the affairs of men is widely accepted and obeyed. It is not identical with any given social ideology or system. Many believe sincerely that democracy is closer to the Kingdom than autocracy; but conceivably we might achieve demo- cratic forms of government throughout the world, and the Kingdom still be far distant. It is not to be equated with uni- versal prosperity, a chicken in every pot, and a late-model car in every garage. Certainly all injustice which allows some to grow wealthy at the expense of others and all insensitivity which permits Dives to enjoy his opulence while Lazarus starves at the gate are incompatible with the kingdom of God; but its true nature is to be defined in spiritual rather than in materialistic terms. It is not our king- dom but God's. And yet it can come only in and through us as we lend ourselves to God's gracious will. And it will not come automatically. The evolutionary process carries no written guaranty that it will eventuate in the Kingdom of Heaven. In one sense it is a present reality, and in another it is a future hope. In so far as any person or group anywhere lives in filial relationship with God and brotherly relationship with others, the Kingdom is there. But the denials of such relation- ships are so manifold and so vicious that the full realization of this happy state lies in the unforeseen future. I confess that I cannot get so excited as I perhaps should over the issue of whether the Kingdom will ever be fully consummated within the scope of human history on this planet, or whether that will happen only in some supramundane realm. The question seems to be a purely academic one. There is still such a very long way to go that the possibility of next steps seems more important than any conjec- ture about ultimate perfection. So long as we can work and hope for a closer ap- proximation than is represented by the present sorry mess of human affairs, it is enough. The Kingdom, although it was God's dream before it was ours, is the most magnificent conception ever to enter the mind of man. It is abundantly worthy to be the chosen goal, the master-motive of each life. And, strangely enough, the life which gives itself without reserve to the Kingdom finds its own highest fulfilment in so doing. Happiness and goodness are not achieved so much by a frontal attack upon them; rather they enter unnoticed through the back door of a personality which is faced toward the Kingdom of God. Psychology, it seems, joins with religion in affirming that those who seek first the Kingdom with their whole hearts will find all other things needful added to them. The implication for religious education of this doctrine was given classical ex- pression years ago by Dr. George A. Coe.
