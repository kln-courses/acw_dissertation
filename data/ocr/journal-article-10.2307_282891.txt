PRENTICE PRINCETON UNIVERSITY We all know that in the seventh and sixth centuries before Christ Greek life and Greek thought alike were transformed. The old land-owning nobles lost the exclusive control of most Greek communities. In many Greek states the aristocratic governments were replaced either by oligarchies, whose membership rested on some other basis than the ownership of the land, or by democracies, some of which showed even before the end of the sixth century very radical tendencies. In the same period also there occurred profound changes in ideas and beliefs, an emancipation of men's minds from thralldom to long-established traditions, which was far more important to the world than the emancipation of men's persons from the domination of a class which previously had been supreme. It seems to me that it would contribute towards an understanding of our own times to inquire what was the connection, if there was any, between these two concomitant revolutions in antiquity, one of which was physical and material, the other intellectual and spiritual. Why should there be any connection between the two? Democratic institutions, with their promotion of uniformity and standardization, have not shown themselves in the past to be more conducive to intellectual and spiritual progress than, for example, some forms of oligarchy. The very opposite view seems to be finding expression at the present time, in spite of all the triumphs of democracy and the identification of de- mocracy in the minds of many with Christianity itself. The more intellectual fascisti claim that their ideal of government is neither monarchy nor democracy, but an intelligent oli- garchy, under which laws shall be made and perhaps adminis-</page><page sequence="2">Vol. Ivi] The Fall of Aristocracies 163 tered by groups of experts in the different fields of human activity. Their talk reminds one a good deal of that tractate on the Athenian democracy which has come down to us under the name of Xenophon. I would gladly accept their ideals as my own, if I could understand how these groups of experts could properly be selected, and how their authority could be maintained. Every form of government thus far devised has had its defects. History shows that science, literature, and art are independent of the form of government, and men's minds have been at least as free under monarchies and oli- garchies which were not too autocratic, as under democracies of any sort. I wish to review briefly how the fall of the ancient Greek aristocracies came about, and what were the causes of this fall; next to inquire whether these same causes, rather than the consequent changes of government, produced the contempo- raneous revolution in thought and in ideas. In the eighth, and to a large extent in the seventh, century conditions of life in Greek communities were essentially feudal. The organization of society was based on the ownership of land. Those who owned their own land and stock constituted the state. Some owned comparatively large estates, and were the nobles; others owned comparatively small estates and were the yeomen. Besides these, there were two classes of persons who were members of the folk but not of the state. The first, and in early times the less important, of these classes was that of the artisans or demiourgoi: later on these formed the large and often dominant industrial class. The other consisted of the laborers, who worked for the nobles or large farmers, or else farmed as tenants portions of the large estates. Between them and their masters existed a relationship of personal dependence which limited their legal rights and laid upon them certain fixed charges in service or produce. They were the thetes of the Greeks, the clientes of the Romans: they were like the serfs of our Middle Ages. Lastly there was a class of persons, not very numerous or important in these early times,</page><page sequence="3">164 William K. Prentice [1925 who were members neither of the state nor of the folk; these, of course, were the slaves.' The source of livelihood during this period was chiefly agriculture. In those districts which had a normal develop- ment absolutely all the arable land was under cultivation at least as early as the seventh century. But soon this was not enough: the land could not support the people. There were two reasons for this. One, of course, was the natural increase of the population. The second was far more important: in ancient times, just as in the Middle Ages, land under culti- vation always deteriorated very rapidly, because the farmers were unable by refertilization to compensate the soil for the crops which they took from it. As Professor Simkhovitch 2 puts it, the ruin of the ancient world was due largely to the lack of fertilizers, and this in turn was due to the lack of hay to support the larger animals at the steadings through the winter. The consequence was that in Greece by the seventh century those who depended for their living on the smaller farms found it increasingly difficult to get along in ordinary times on the year's crop: every bad season brought famine and borrowing. Of course, the poor man's land was the security, his farm: if that was not enough, then his person and his family. Thus all the land was fast falling into the possession of the nobles, who already owned the larger shares of it, and all the independent farmers were fast becoming day laborers or serfs, without land or citizenship, if not actually slaves or refugees. Such circumstances brought about the Greek colonization, which began about the middle of the eighth century and lasted until the middle of the sixth. Undoubtedly there were various reasons for this colonization; but two of these were so im- portant that all the others seem to me comparatively insig- nificant. These two were: first, the necessity of providing homes in a new world for those whom the old countries could no 1 Edward Meyer, Die Sklaverei im Altertum, 1898, pp. 14 ff. 2 V. G.

Colonization afforded a temporary relief from an intolerable situation. But all the while a permanent and far more efficient remedy for the existing evils was appearing of itself in the development of industry and commerce. Manufacture, merchandising, and transportation soon provided a new and sufficient means of livelihood for the downtrodden peasants, driven from their lands by the increase of population and the deterioration of the soil, and made them independent of the oppressive nobility. Many who had been farmers or farm hands heretofore flocked into the cities, and became what we would call industrials. Others found employment as handlers of freight, the raw materials coming in and the finished products going out, the porters and truckmen, the dockhands and longshoremen. Others manned the boats and ships, as rowers or sailors, or built the vessels and kept them in repair. Besides these of course there grew up a large variety of employees connected with the making, carrying, and marketing of goods, from the clerks in the offices to the night watchmen and messengers. Soon there was more than enough work for everyone, and the proof of this-if proof is needed-lies in the fact that as early as the seventh century some of the Greek cities, instead of encouraging emigration any longer, were beginning to acquire in addition to their normal population large numbers of male slaves, a class which was almost un- known in the preceding century, as it was in the Homeric Age. The development of industry and commerce effected the emancipation of large numbers of people from the domination of the landowners. The possession of land ceased to be, as before, the basis of the organization of society, feudalism was to a large extent abolished, and the power of the nobles, who were the chief landowners, was permanently broken. Wher- ever these changes occurred there followed changes in the 12</page><page sequence="5">166 WVilliam K. Prentice [1925 governments of the various states, all tending to become more or less completely democratic. It is true that there were some other causes which contributed to this result. The most important of these was the increase and improvement of arms and armor, and the consequent development of military tactics, which led to the formation of the phalanx of heavy- armed infantry, composed of the middle class, which soon displaced the old armies of nobles and their retainers. When the commons were properly equipped and sufficiently organized to constitute the chief arm of the national defense, they found it easy to wrest from their former masters the exclusive control of the state and to acquire at least a share in the government. But wresting the control of the government by force or threat of force from a privileged class would not have sufficed to bring about a permanent change in the organization of society and the conditions of life. The fundamental cause of the change was the development of the great commercial and industrial classes, whose living was independent of the soil controlled chiefly by a few aristocrats. No more tremendous revolution can be conceived, whether it takes place gradually and without much actual bloodshed, as apparently it did take place in most of the ancient Greek states, or suddenly and violently, as it has taken place else- where at other times. Wherever large amounts of land are held by a few, especially if the landowners do not themselves participate in the cultivation of the land, evils ensue and consequent unhappiness to many. Probably the same is true when capital of any sort is concentrated in the hands of a limited class. If the possessors persist in holding their own in spite of changing conditions, ultimately there will be hatred and violence. Wherever conditions essentially feudal obtain, commonly great upheavals take place, in which much cruelty and brutality is displayed, many lives are sacrificed, property is ruined, prosperity destroyed. I suppose that this was the fundamental cause of the French revolution. I am very sure that it is the chief cause of the present situation in Russia,</page><page sequence="6">Vol. Ivi] The Fall of Aristocracies 167 where the transition is still far from completion. The same thing seems to me to be going on in Mexico, where the tran- sition seems to be only at its beginning, and elsewhere. It may take a very long time for a country to recover from the effects of such an upheaval; but it seems evident that even a period of terror and bloodshed is better than a continuance of feudal conditions, under which civilization advances only to a certain point and then stagnates or decays, and happiness for the masses becomes impossible. The emancipation of the ancient Greeks from the feudalism of their middle ages was contemporaneous with or closely followed by an emancipation of Greek minds and spirits from thralldom to tradition. It is for this that we are most indebted to the Greeks. That they accomplished so much in this respect was due to the peculiar genius of that most gifted people. That they accomplished anything at all was due, at least in part, to those changes in the external circumstances of their lives to which I have referred. For many of them, towards the end of the seventh century before Christ, the world in which their fathers lived had already passed away: in that new life upon which they were entering many of the most essential elements were unknown and unpredictable. The very basis of their former organization had been altered, kings and rulers deposed, masters defied and repudiated, conventions and habits of life broken. Many had even changed their daily occupations and become city dwellers, instead of country folk. Everywhere material prosperity was increasing, and this prosperity was extending more and more widely through the different classes of society, as in our own time. Culture, like government, belonged no longer to the small circle of a ruling class. "Everywhere," says Eduard Meyer, "grew up richer and more varied forms of culture. Not that the old forms or ideas were altogether abolished; but they were transformed, and, as it were, stripped of their monopoly. The old had to make way for the new impulse in everything, and either absorb the new, or adapt itself thereto.</page><page sequence="7">168 William K. Prentice [1925 And therewith began, in the realm of ideas, those revolutionary movements which declared war oon the traditions of the past, and with mighty blows led in the forces of a new era." 3 Compelled by circumstances to abandon much that commonly retards men's progress, is it any wonder that the Greeks traveled for a time with extraordinary speed to an unpre- cedented distance? Some external influences, of course, contributed a good deal to the awakening of their minds and the arousing of their spirits to attain intellectual freedom. Colonization, for example, had led them into parts of the world unknown to them before, enlarging their vision and experience, stirring their imagination. Contact with the civilization of Lydia, Phoenicia, and especially Egypt taught them much which conflicted with their inherited opinions and beliefs, and compelled them to revise their ideas about the world and about themselves. Moreover, their rapidly growing commerce com- pelled them to adopt the methods and inventions of more civilized peoples, who had been longer in business than them- selves. But chiefly it was from their own untrammeled thinking that enlightenment came to the Greeks. Curiously enough, as it seems to me, it was in the sphere of morals that this change first appears. In the days of the Homeric poets goodness, that is aper', meant any kind of physical excellence, as in women beauty, in men strength. But from the beginning of the seventh century this word goodness began to acquire the meaning of excellence in charac- ter, or morality, though of course for a long time it was still used in the older sense. In consequence the belief gained acceptance that by individual effort goodness could be ac- quired, whereas in the previous age goodness was regarded as necessarily a free gift of the gods. Under the influence of this change in moral notions religious ideas began to change also. Belief emerged that the gods are the guardians of right, the punishers of wrong, and that a 3 Geschichte des Altertums, iI, ? 369.</page><page sequence="8">Vol. Ivi] The Fall of Aristocracies 169 virtuous life is pleasing to the gods. To such belief it was, of course, a necessary corollary that the gods should be regarded as virtuous themselves; but this conception was irreconcilable with the crass anthropomorphism of the traditional mythology incorporated in the epic poetry. Thoughtful persons, there- fore, were confronted by a dilemma which must have seemed to many hopeless, the necessity of repudiating either their sacred literature or their more enlightened morality. We may well sympathize with them. Others were led to a fundamental reformation of their theology and their religion.4 I often wonder what people really mean when they speak about the Greek religion. The ancient Greeks, like our own modern selves, had two religions, which existed side by side for centuries. Though they were inconsistent, there were few persons in all that time who did not, to some extent, adhere to both; for scarcely anyone has ever been wholly emancipated from the traditions of the past or wholly impervious to new ideas. One of these religions was outward and formal. It consisted of many cults, in which the obligation of the worship- ers ended with the performance of a ritual. It had little, if any, influence on the lives and practices of men. The other was a religion of the mind and heart, and reacted profoundly on the personal morality of its adherents. It had its origin in the period of which I am speaking, and was due, at least in part, to those changes in moral conceptions which I have mentioned. I do not need to speak here about the development of literature and art among the Greeks, except to recall the fact that both alike began anew in this period of regeneration, and were thereafter characterized by emancipation from tradition, from former ideas and methods, and by a tremendous growth of individuality based on accurate observation and personal feeling. There remains, however, one element in this new life which no account can properly neglect. I mean what the Greeks themselves called philosophy, consisting chiefly, at least at this early time, of what we would call natural science. 4Beloch, op. cit. J2, 1, pp. 315 ff.</page><page sequence="9">170 William K. Prentice [1925 At the head of this movement stands Thales of Miletus: he caused great wonderment by his successful prediction of the eclipse of the sun which took place in 585, or, as Beloch thinks, in 557 B.C. "Chaldean astronomers," says Beloch, "long before had calculated eclipses, and their observations alone made Thales' prediction possible." The Chaldeans, however, had not advanced beyond the mere registration of the facts. Thales, on the contrary, made the full deduction from his discovery: it became clear to him that everything in nature occurs in accordance with fixed laws.5 But what a revolt from traditional belief and popular prejudice was involved in this conclusion! Thales must have been far on the way to an emancipation of mind and spirit from the traditions of the past, before he could venture to make the movements of these heavenly bodies the objects of close observation and calcu- lation. Heretofore, sun, moon, and planets had been thought by the Greeks to be divine beings, endowed with personality, identified in a vague way with certain gods, capable of inde- pendent action according to their own will and pleasure, or under direction of still higher powers. Thereafter, these same bodies were regarded by many as inanimate, their courses unalterable and determined by laws which might be discovered and formulated by men. There is no reason to believe that in the ancient world the fall of aristocracies in itself effected the emancipation of men's minds. Both alike resulted from the same changes in the external conditions of men's lives. Nor was freedom of mind promoted in any large degree by democratic institutions. The perfect fruit of democracy seems to be standardization, a blight upon individuality. That Athens under its democracy became the intellectual and spiritual leader of the ancient world was due partly to the innate talents of its people, and partly to the fact that Athens for a long time was the chief center of inter- course. Athens might have been that under an intelligent monarchy or oligarchy. It should be remembered that many 5 Op. cit. I, 1, p. 436 and 2, ? 136.</page><page sequence="10">Vol. lvi] The Fall of Aristocracies 171 of the greatest philosophers and artists at Athens were foreigners. We do not know that any of the Greek cities of the Levant were democracies in the period of the so-called " lonian Enlightenment," and even later few were democracies for any length of time except under the compulsion of the Athenian Empire. We do know, however, that it was in Ionia and the larger islands that city life in a modern sense was first developed. Dean Pound of the Harvard Law School has recently called attention to the importance of the change which has taken place in our own country "from a rural, agricultural society to an urban, industrial society." Such a change is more important to a people than many changes of government. It was the chief cause of the transformation of Greek life and Greek thought in the seventh and sixth centu- ries. For it liberated many from the domination of their former masters, led them into new ways in which old customs no longer obtained, broke the power of tradition and thus let the mind of man go free. In some respects the Greeks of that age were like these "Young Turks" of the present day, of whom Professor Shotwell says-I quote from the New York Herald of December 17, 1925-" They are attempting to build a new Turkey, which is in their minds as new as though there had been no such past as that which is symbolized in the monuments of Constantinople." Tradition is a good counsellor, but a bad master. We, who are accounted the custodians of the classical tradition, should remember also those "Revolutionaire Bewegungen, welche dem Herkommen den Krieg erkliiren und mit gewaltigen Schliigen den Beginn einer neuen Epoche verkiindigen."</page></plain_text>
