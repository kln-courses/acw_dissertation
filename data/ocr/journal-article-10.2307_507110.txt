It was bound to happen sooner or later: the names of Roland Barthes and Michel Foucault, patron saints of lit- erary theory and cultural studies, have now been invoked at the start of a book meant as a popular introduction to the most familiar genre of Greek art. The book is Nigel Spivey's Understanding Greek Sculpture:Ancient Meanings, Mod- ern Readings, and one of its principal Barthesian themes, stated in the first chapter, is that the history of ancient sculpture (like that of art and literature generally) can no longer be taught or understood solely or even primarily in terms of the contributions of those artists whose names happen to survive in our sources (or inscriptions). It was not the lonely, individual "genius" who shaped and deter- mined the course of Greek sculpture, but the needs and demands of Greek society, its structures of power and pa- tronage, its audiences and cultural contexts. This is surely a defensible position; but its logical extensions insist not merely that the principles of connoisseurship and attri- bution established by Adolf Furtwangler just over a cen- tury ago have outlived their usefulness as the central acts of ancient art history, but also that the supposedly distinct "personalities" we are used to invoking in our discussions of ancient sculpture-Polykleitos, Pheidias, and so on- are no more than artificial modern constructs. In short, the explanation for a particular work of art should no longer be sought in the individuality or originality of the person who produced it: the artist must be "effaced," and his "tyranny" over the act of interpretation must be overthrown. Now, Spivey himself claims a more moderate position than this and duly notes the irony that Barthes, who in a fa- mous essay proclaimed "la mort de l'auteur" and assaulted the idea of "the prestige of the individual" as a capitalist fiction, has become widely hailed for his own authorial power. Similarly, the academic cult of Foucault shows few signs of abating (The Author is dead! Long live the The- orist, who is also an Author!). At any rate, despite his sus- picion of the "artist-as-genius" approach to Greek sculp- ture, Spivey is, as we shall see, prepared to accept the originality and power of at least one of the "masters" whose names have come down to us. On the whole, it is easy to sympathize with Spivey's skep- ticism of traditional methods of scholarship and the at- tribution game. And it is not hard to see the worth of the notion that Greek culture and the Greek audience - that attempts to situate the sculpture within society rather than merely describe the individual character of the sculptor- should occupy the foreground of analysis (the study of Greek vase painting, to which Spivey himself has notably contributed, has already shifted its focus and pointed the way). For Spivey (154), the limits of conventional method- ologies and the fragility of purely stylistic analysis were exposed by the discovery and exhibition of the Riace War- riors, which, though indisputably ancient, were immedi- ately subject to such widely differing attributions and dat- ings that an outside observer might have fairly wondered if we knew what we were talking about. But if it is reason- able for Spivey to "privilege" society, function, and context over individual genius and the "cult of the artist," the book he has produced still leaves much to be desired as a gen- eral introduction to the study of Greek sculpture. The second chapter, for example, beats a dead horse: Ernst Gombrich's theory, fully propounded in his classic Art and Illusion2 (Princeton 1961), that the naturalistic course of Greek art- a course that broke free of the schema and led to the plausible depiction of figures in space- was driven by Greek (specifically Homeric) narrative, that the art of telling stories in words fueled lifelike, three- dimensional representation in art. I cannot say how influ- ential Gombrich's explanation for the "Greek Revolution (or Miracle)" has been outside our discipline; but, though deservedly treated with respect on the rare occasions it is mentioned at all (cf. J. Carter, BSA 67 [1972] 25-58), it has never been taken as gospel within it (besides, the peoples of the Near East also told stories). Still, Spivey uses the theory as a starting point for his own argument that the revolution was the result of a complex mixture of Athenian democracy (which Gombrich also factored in), technical innovations, conscious competition with the two- dimensional art of the Near East, and the influence of Athenian drama. For Spivey, however, the principal and necessary ingredient in the mix was "the demands of an- thropomorphic cult practice." That is, Greek sculpture be- came increasingly naturalistic because the Greeks consid- ered their cult statues to be animate, possessed of"a life of their own" (48), and a new kind of representation was needed to accommodate their anthropomorphism. But a belief in the statue's ability to act and respond was hardly unique to ancient Greece (statues of Gudea, for example, 587 American Journal of Archaeology 101 (1997)</page><page sequence="2">588 JEFFREY M. HURWIT [AJA 101 appeal to the gods of Lagash on his behalf, often with in- scriptions in the first person written directly upon them), and it is unlikely that spectators confronting the huge cult statue of Zeus at Olympia or the Athena Parthenos (a quasi- cult statue) walked away impressed by their naturalism and three-dimensionality rather than by their majestic, chrys- elephantine transcendence. Moreover, the statues that for us best mark the subversion of the schema-works like the Kritios Boy, which Spivey calls, with just a hint of dis- paragement, the "cover boy" of the Greek Revolution and which is indeed found on the dust jacket of his book- were not cult statues. (Spivey [77] assumes the eyes of the Kritios Boy were inlaid to enhance his naturalism, but does not raise the possibility that the technique, known in marble statues as early as the Moschophoros, might rather reflect work in bronze.) In this chapter Spivey seems to be saying that Greek sculpture became more naturalistic because Greek sculptors aimed for greater verisimilitude, which is not saying much. Interestingly, to bolster his theory, Spivey concludes by invoking "Pygmalion's Power," a conceit bril- liantly explored by none other than Ernst Gombrich. The rest of the book is not a history of Greek sculpture per se, but has a kind of history embedded within it. Chapter 3, for example, deals with techniques of bronze casting and stone carving, but focuses on Daedalic and Ar- chaic sculpture, as does chapter 4, a useful essay on the occasions for dedicating statues and the political purposes of architectural sculpture and its role in "peer polity inter- action." Chapter 5 is concerned with the "heroic" nature of Greek sculpture- with "heroic nudity" and the heroiza- tion of such figures as Harmodios and Aristogeiton and the youths of grave stelai (both Archaic and Classical). Chapter 6 focuses on the centrality of Marathon in Early and High Classical Athenian iconography, including the "myth-history" of the Parthenon, while in chapter 7 Pheid- ias is "lost" and "found" again. On the one hand, Spivey (159) claims that "no convincing account of [Pheidias's] career is possible," given the nature of the sources and the improbability that he had much to do with the architec- tural sculptures of the Parthenon (Spivey italicizes the "bold statement" that no ancient source attributes the pediments to Pheidias [158], as if no one else had noticed). On the other hand, he cannot help but find Pheidias's genius at work in the Olympian Zeus and the Athena Parthenos (though he omits the interesting detail that Pausanias, who is not shy about attributing several other works on the Acropolis to Pheidias, does not attribute the Athena Parthe- nos to him, possibly because he knew that the statue he saw was, to some extent at least, a reworking of the Pheid- ian original). Still, the "overweening input" (169) of the individual artist matters to Spivey after all, and so Pheid- ias is spared the theoretical death to which others might be consigned. Chapters 8 and 9 deal with Late Classical and Hellenistic art, the first focusing on the image of Aph- rodite and the "shock of the [female] nude,' the second on the patronage of kings like Mausolus, Alexander, and the Attalids. The book concludes with a chapter on the reception (and plundering) of Greek sculpture by Romans and modern Europeans, in which he cautiously but rightly notes the inadequacy of the term "Roman copy" (222), and an epilogue that unabashedly stresses the greatness of Greek sculpture and its rightful claim to "canonical status,' something that some postmodern canon-smashers might snicker at. Despite the book's title, some of its readings are not so "modern" For example, Spivey prefers the traditional iden- tification of the twin kouroi of Delphi as Kleobis and Biton to the new one that sees them as the Dioskouroi (108-109) and he favors (22) Raubitschek's old hypothesis that the Kritios Boy is an athlete dedicated by Kallias, rather than recent arguments that he is a young Theseus (fair enough, but why publish photos of the statue in its inac- curate, pre-1987 restoration?). There are also too many in- stances in which Spivey is misleading, careless, or flat-out wrong. He dates the Chest of Kypselos to the seventh cen- tury (31), though it almost certainly belonged to the early sixth. He states that the Lesser Panathenaia, an annual festival, was held every two years (36); he gets it right later (145). He generalizes thatJewish scholars are "perhaps in- clined to stress the role of the Phoenicians" in the emer- gence of Archaic art (54); he does not name names, but Jews owe no natural allegiance to Phoenicians, as he im- plies. The text (47) dates the bronze Piraeus Apollo to ca. 510, the caption to ca. 530-520; as it turns out, neither date may be right (see below). The caption to the Auxerre kore (61) dates her early in the seventh century; she is dated by everyone else later, ca. 630. The inexperienced reader might easily infer from his discussion of the colossal Naxian Apollo (65) that the statue and its base really were carved from the same stone block (they were not). Kephi- sodotos's group of Eirene and Ploutos stood in the Agora, not on the Areopagus (91; cf. Paus. 1.8.2). His reading of the Hesperides metope from the Temple of Zeus at Olympia (104) is a little off target: Athena is not an invisible pres- ence, but is there to support the cosmos so that Herakles and Atlas can trade places once again. Marathon was not "the first serious test of the young [Athenian] democracy" (126); the brief but significant war with Chalkis and Boeo- tia in 506 was, and was duly commemorated by a major monument on the Acropolis that was renewed after the Persian destruction. These are, perhaps, minor points. More serious is Spivey's attempt (following Foucault's analysis of pseudo-Lucian [Amores 11-17]) to read the Aphrodite of Knidos as her- maphroditic, since one of Lucian's characters is taken with its "boyish flanks" (181). Lucian's satire uses the famous statue lightly to launch a debate on the relative merits of heterosexuality and homosexuality, but there is a differ- ence between interpreting his satire and interpreting Prax- iteles' statue, and any modern reading of the original as an icon of sexual ambiguity simply defies common sense (as well as other ancient sources and Roman copies, which do not look boyish to me). In addition, Spivey finds a fifth- century antecedent for the Praxitelean wonder in a "lost" statue from the west pediment of the Parthenon, but this figure (S, known from the Carrey drawing) surely is a naked boy (its torso may even survive; see O. Palagia, The Pedi- ments of the Parthenon [Leiden 1993] 50). Spivey also readily endorses both Boardman's reading of the pediments from the Archaic Acropolis as Peisistratid allegories (99) and his controversial interpretation of the Parthenon frieze as a monument to the Marathonian dead (148). Boardman's ingenious readings are popular and clearly "modern;' but having first been proposed two de-</page><page sequence="3">1997] THE DEATH OF THE SCULPTOR? 589 cades ago and more, they are now also venerable, and a number of scholars have in the meantime pointed out prob- lems. Spivey omits or minimizes any mention of them. He is also attracted (though not committed) to the view that the Riace bronzes stood at Delphi as part of Pheidias's multifigured monument to Marathon and the Eponymous Heroes (136), despite the convincing arguments of C. Rolley and others to the contrary. He is entitled to these and other opinions, of course, but he seems unduly sympathetic to R. Carpenter's theory that there was a "Kimonian Parthe- non" (137) and briefly finds "attractive" J. Connelly's im- probable new interpretation of the Parthenon frieze as a narrative of the Erechtheid saga (AJA 100 [1996] 53-80); ultimately, he rejects Connelly's reading for Boardman's (146-47). Still, Spivey seems unaware that the chariots on the Parthenon frieze are taking part in an apobates com- petition (at least he tells us nothing of the contest) (148). Similarly, from his discussion of the inscriptions detailing work on the Erechtheion frieze (162-63), the reader would assume that the frieze was a standard marble one, not a rare composite (with individual high relief marble figures pegged onto a bluish Eleusinian limestone background). Here as elsewhere, what Spivey leaves out is as significant as what he puts in. Despite the occasional odd usage (like "diktats," 39) and theoretical code phrases ("body fascism," "the gynaecology of Greek art," "the male gaze"), Spivey's book is a readable, spirited one, and I do not quarrel with its basic point that our critical activity should focus on the contexts and func- tions of Greek sculpture rather than, exclusively, on the careers of sculptors whose own stylistic identities depend too often on a tissue of attributions rather than a chain of original works. But the book is so often muddled, in- complete, or inaccurate that it could well lead to the mis- understanding of Greek sculpture. Carol Mattusch's new book is something else again: a careful, erudite, richly informative treatment of Greek and Roman bronzes that forces a reevaluation of the very na- ture of the genre, making us understand it in new ways and question such traditional distinctions as those between "sculptor" and "founder," "original" and "copy," and even "Greek" and "Roman." Firmly grounded in the author's for- midable knowledge of techniques and firsthand examina- tion of bronzes both ancient and modern (116-21), it attempts to elevate issues of technique to the same level as issues of style, attribution, or iconography. It succeeds, definitively. The book's early chapters cogently explain bronze tech- niques and present such broad issues as the repetitive or reiterative proclivities of Greek art in general (manifest in works as varied as Geometric bronzes, the protomes of Orientalizing tripod-cauldrons, the korai from the marble Geneleos group at the Samian Heraion, and virtually duplicate Attic vases). But at its heart are detailed case studies of what Mattusch contends were "serially produced" monumental groups (such as the Eponymous Heroes of Athens) and individual works like the relatively little known bronze torsos in Florence and Vani (in ancient Colchis). Her conclusions are sometimes surprising, even revolution- ary. For example, Mattusch demonstrates that the Florence torso (like one in New York) is a copy of another ancient bronze, and she argues that the Vani torso, which looks fifth century, was in fact cast in the second century as a Hellenistic reproduction or manipulation of a Classical type. The style of these bronzes is therefore no reliable indication of their date of manufacture. With this the foun- dations of traditional analysis begin to quake. Fundamental to Mattusch's arguments is the reproduc- ible nature of the indirect lost-wax method of bronze- casting, which, like other bronze-casting techniques, assures that in a sense there is no such thing as a "Classical bronze original"' since the real original was the wax image that melted away (2). At all events, the process permits the casting of a series of statues from one master model and theoretically permits repeated castings over a virtually in- definite period of time. Copying is thus "a fundamental characteristic of the medium" (149) and is as endemic to Greek sculpture as it is to Roman. Mattusch's appreciation of the method and its implications leads to conclusions that depart markedly from conventional wisdom. We can no longer be sure, for example, that the Piraeus Apollo is a late sixth-century work rather than a second-century Archaizing one (138-40). And while the Riace bronzes' differences in hairstyle, musculature, and even posture have led many scholars to date them a generation apart, Mat- tusch argues that both statues (which are nearly identical in dimensions and outlines) were based on the same orig- inal model: the differences between them are the result of different workings and manipulations of the wax work- ing models derived, through master molds, from a single source (64). In the same way, the Eponymous Heroes in the Agora were all probably just reiterations of two basic models or types, and it was their democratic similarity, rather than their slight differences, that was the point (65). The technique was in this case well suited to Athenian ideology. Along the way Mattusch tackles some venerable contro- versies. She concludes, for example, that the dynamically posed Tyrannicides of Kritios and Nesiotes were probably meant to resemble Antenor's originals, since the similarity would have reassured the Athenian citizenry that political equilibrium had returned after the Persian destruction and theft of the earlier group (62). But the major theme of the book (after the argument that bronzes large and small were serially produced and represented limited sculp- tural types) is that the Classical bronze was often the re- sult of a collaboration between the artist/sculptor who made the master model and the technician/founder who actu- ally did the casting, that it was in this "merging of tasks" that the meaning of tekhne resides (221). For some, Mattusch may appear to go too far in virtually equating the labor of the technician with the creative enterprise of the artist: the importance of Henri Lebosse to the oeuvre of Rodin should not be minimized, but he was not Rodin (cf. 192). Still, it is hard to argue with the view that the success of the finished bronze depended on the skill of the founder as well as (for Mattusch, as much as) on the original model or conception of the artist (218). And, if Mattusch is right that the Greek founder, independent of the original "ar- tist," could alter the master by introducing anatomical vari- ations and even adjusting the position of limbs in the wax working model, then the distinction between sculptor and founder is no longer secure: indeed, the founder becomes a sculptor. Now, the nature of the collaboration must have</page><page sequence="4">590 JEFFREY M. HURWIT [AJA 101 varied considerably. While Nesiotes may, for example, have been founder to the sculptor Kritios (and took equal credit for certain statues with inscribed signatures), there is no evidence that Polykleitos ever relinquished control over the production of the Doryphoros to a technician, while Lysippos, as Mattusch notes, is said to have been a bronze- worker before he became a bronze sculptor and must surely have cast some of his own works. On the other hand, Lysippos could not possibly have been personally respon- sible for all 1,500 of the statues Pliny reports (HN 34.37). There is, of course, no need to accept Pliny's figure liter- ally, but the indirect lost-wax process meant that the num- ber of"Lysippoi" could have proliferated without Lysippos's personal supervision. Once he created a master model, he was free to move on to new projects while foundry tech- nicians reproduced or varied it, adding details or making changes as needed (72). So, the number of statues Lysippos actually cast and the number of Lysippoi that were ulti- mately cast may have widely diverged. Mattusch further undermines traditional conceptions of how ancient statuary was produced with the striking conclusion that distinguishing and dating styles may, given the nature of the indirect process and the longevity of cer- tain types, "no longer be a relevant exercise" (190), and that large categories of ancient sculpture- the Sleeping Eros type, for example (161-63)-- may not depend upon the work of individual masters at all. Mattusch does not deny the originality and importance of artists such as Lysippos, but she is suspicious of "the modern interest in famous artists" nonetheless (222). In the wake of her provocative book, the individuality of the ancient bronze sculptor recedes behind the reproducibility of the medium, the dominance of the type, and the skill and creative contributions of the founder. Perhaps this, too, is a kind of death. Finally, there is John Boardman's latest handbook, and it is what we have come to expect and appreciate: an ex- tremely concise survey accompanied by a wealth of illus- trations of works both familiar and obscure. The book is organized by genre and subject (architectural sculpture, funerary sculpture, portraiture, and so on) but, though its coverage is broad, its analysis is necessarily thin. In only 77 pages of text that often read like notes, Boardman rarely has more than a few sentences to give to any one mon- ument or artist, though the Mausoleum, Praxiteles, and Lysippos receive a couple of pages each. Like Homer, Board- man nods from time to time: the Lysimakhe that Deme- trios of Alopeke portrayed on the Acropolis was not 64 years old (104), but had served as priestess for 64 years; and it was Demetrios of Phaleron who imposed sumptuary legislation upon Athens, not Demetrios Poliorketes (114). These are minor slips, of course. But one is a little sur- prised to read that the Aphrodite of Knidos was trying to cover her belly (!) with her hand (54), rather than more private parts below. And Boardman is likely to raise more eyebrows with some politically charged opinions sharply injected into a concluding chapter dealing with collecting and modern views of the Antique. Not everyone will agree that "rescue" is the best word to describe what Lord Elgin did to the Acropolis marbles (225), that museums should not necessarily reject the purchase of undocumented or stolen antiquities (since such activity is just another form of"re-cycling"), or that archaeological associations should not forbid their publication (since to pretend such ill-gotten goods do not exist is a kind of censorship) (226-27). While it clearly deserves a place on the shelf beside the others in its black-and-white-covered series, the odd thing is that the book surveys not only Late Classical material from the Greek heartland, but also, in five very short chap- ters, a much broader chronological range of "colonial" prod- ucts or works from the edges of the Greek world- that is, Greek sculpture from South Italy and Sicily and from Anatolia, the Levant, and North Africa, dating from the Archaic all the way down to the Hellenistic periods. There is a certain incongruity about finding a survey of the sixth- century metopes from Selinus, for example,just a few pages after a review of fourth-century Athenian funerary and votive reliefs; in undergraduate surveys, at least, this might prove awkward. And one briefly wonders why the Nereid Monument at Xanthos (a fourth-century tomb decorated by Greek sculptors for a non-Greek dynast of Lycia), here consigned to the chapter on Anatolia, should not have found its way into the main text along with the Mausoleum (an- other fourth-century tomb decorated by Greek sculptors for a non-Greek dynast of neighboring Caria). It is certainly good to have so handy a photographic record of so much material and to see such heretofore barely known works as the Graeco-Etruscan nude goddess in Orvieto (fig. 203) make it into what might now be called Boardman's Canon. But one senses that Boardman simply prefers the center to the periphery, and he occasionally adopts a slightly con- descending tone even toward the products of Magna Graecia (144): the Foce del Sele metopes are fine, for example, as long as one does not compare them to contemporary works from the mainland (148-49). A separate handbook (who is better qualified than Boardman to write a Greek Sculp- ture Overseas?), or greater assimilation of the "colonial" ma- terial in his earlier ones, would have been a better solu- tion than the short sections tacked on here. Though his book is for good reason more conservative than the others under review, Boardman is clearly sensi- tive to new trends in the study of Greek sculpture and hints that the glory days of attribution may be behind us. He even suggests the study of technique may open up new paths of analysis, and so seems to predict Mattusch's work (7-8). But his is a cautious, measured approach, still favor- ing traditional methods (one chapter is entitled "Names and Attributions"), still comfortable with terms like "orig- inal" and "copy." And it is still possible for him to speak of the intentions of individual sculptors and conclude that the major changes in the course of Greek sculpture are still mainly attributable to the innovations of individual sculptors or schools (14). The pendulum of the criticism of ancient Greek sculp- ture is nonetheless swinging. It is fair to ask whether the artist exists except in the works he leaves behind and, if no "original" works by an ancient sculptor exist, whether he can be said to have any existence at all. But if the Greek statue must first be understood within its context, if re- constructions of the "personality" of the ancient artist can- not alone occupy the center of our critical activity, this does not mean that the accomplishments or styles of individual artists have no claim upon us. Polykleitos had a measur- able effect upon the course of Greek sculpture; so did Ly- sippos. The sculptor still matters, and this is so because</page><page sequence="5">1997] 591 the ancient sculpture, like any work of art, came into being at the conjunction of culture/society, audiencelspectator, and artist/artisan. One may justly concentrate on the work's relationship to any one of the elements of its artistic en- vironment. It does no good, however, to focus upon any one of those coordinates to the exclusion of the others. We too often have, it is true, serious problems of evidence, and attribution is still too often guesswork. But the argument that the identity of the ancient Greek sculptor or the very idea of originality are artificial, useless modern constructs does not, in the end, help much. Besides, fictions do not claim credit for their works, the way Pheidias did on a stele seen in the room of the Athena Parthenos (Plut. Per. 13.14). Reports of the death of the ancient sculptor thus seem to me to be greatly exaggerated. As two recent, thick volumes on Polykleitos (W. Moon ed., Polykleitos, the Dory- phoros and Tradition, Madison 1995; H. Beck et al. eds., Polyklet: Der Bildhauer der griechischen Klassik, Mainz 1990) and a new collection of essays on the contributions of five individual masters (0. Palagia andJ.J. Pollitt eds., Personal Styles in Greek Sculpture [YCS 30, Cambridge 1996]) show, many scholars do not even think he is very sick. Why kill him?
