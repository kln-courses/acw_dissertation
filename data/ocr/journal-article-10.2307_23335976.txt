<plain_text><page sequence="1">POINTS OF VIEW Indianness in Indian Literature TND1AN LITERATURE comprised only Vedic and -*• Sanskrit Literatures when Albrecht Weber wrote his History of Indian Literature in 1852. Half a century later, in 1907, when Maurice Winternitz wrote bis History, the compass widened to include Pali and Prakrit also. Further, Winternitz went so far as to concede that the literature in the regional languages was 'by no means insignificant' and generously allocated to it an Appendix of about 70 pages in a three-volume work of 2000 pages. Since Winternitz, the horizons have further expanded. Not only have the literatures in the once 'native' langu ages established their independent identity, but what with the growing awareness of each other's literatures, it is now firmly recognized that a common centre holds them all. What, then, is the dilferentia that make the various literatures of this country 'Indian'? There is now and the* some flutter in scholarly circles on this point, but the question is still awaiting a thorough debate and satis factory conclusions. In the following pages, two of our eminent writers, one a novelist and the other an essayist and critic, have offered their views on the subject. There is certainly much more that can be added to these and the IL welcomes any meaningful contribution in this regard.—Ed. 65</page><page sequence="2">Indianness in Indian Literature i THAKAZHI SIVASANKARA PILLAI TT is said that Indian Literature is one though written in A many languages. This view confers upon the works in diffe rent Indian languages a national status. I consider it my proud privilege to be identified as an Indian writer. I feel happy about it. A slight conceptual muddle, however, attends on our discus sion of the 'Indianness' of our literature. This gives rise to certain vague doubts. What else remains of the Indian novel or literature if not its Indianness? It is likely that the distinctive nature of a literature—its marked Hindi nature, Tamil nature, Malayali nature, Bengali nature, etc.—might call in question its claim to Indianness. I don't think in a country like the USSR, people tend to be suspicious about the Soviet nature of their literature. Be it a Tadzhik novel or an Uzbek novel, it remains to be, first and last, a Soviet novel. The Russians claim that the notional nationality of their literature owes much to their way of life. I think we too have a distinct way of life, of our own, which is Indian. Still we seek to identify the Indianness of our literature. Is Indianness a concept to be evolved by dint of an act of will; a point to be made in arguments; or, an ideal to be realized on the dizzy heights of sentiments? Does it constitute a formless idea, an end in itself, or a self-seeking interest? I think, Indianness is real even as our literature is real. In the days of yore, in the age dipicted in the Mahabharata, the ancients believed that Gandhara was a part of Afghanistan. Today's Afghanistan used to be a province within the bounda ries of ancient India. Now, is it possible for us to say anything of the Indianness of Afghanistan? That is better left unsaid; it 66</page><page sequence="3">ON INDIANNESS IN LITERATURE might strain our bilateral relationship. One might perhaps speak about the elements of Indianness in the Southeast-Asian countries. Even this is a subject better avoided, considering the complexities of world affairs. Maybe our diplomats discuss the topic of Indianness at dinner table with due caution. Let me narrate my experience in Riga, capital of the Latvia state of the Soviet Union. I was privileged to lead a delegation of Indian writers to a conference of litterateurs. Pakistan, Bang ladesh and some East European countries had been represented in this conference. Convention demanded that the representa tives jointly issue a communique as the conference drew to a close. We sat together to prepare this document. Here, an all too harmless statement created much ado: the sentence simply stated that India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh once formed a single nation. The delegate from Pakistan was annoyed at this. He shouted that it was a wrong statement. He asserted that India and Pakistan had fought all through history, and that the two countries had never been one. I too shouted something at him. Some Southeast-Asian friends intervened. The Bangla Deshi delegates, however, remained shrewdly reticent. The Pakistani delegate, a poet named Faiz Ahmad Faiz (an altogether strange name to me, although some of my North Indian friends seemed to know him quite well) refused to give in. The communique being inevitable, we settled on a less categorical statement that, in history, India and Pakistan had shared a common ground of experience. It appeared to me that the Pakistani poet was very adamant on this point because he desired a peaceful life back home. I, for my part, insisted mainly because of my Indianness —or lack of it. My concept of Indianness is that of an average villager's. Perhaps there could be this difference: that the villager may not think of his culture in terms of an awareness of his Indianness. He believes that his birth in the holy land of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata is a blessing. He has per force to lead his life accordingly. I shall try to explain and analyse a villager's sense of Indian ness with the benefit of whatever little education I can claim to 67</page><page sequence="4">INDIAN LITERATURE have. How do our village folk develop their 'Indianness' which I may describe as the essence of their culture? Do they merely hold fast to certain conventional precedents, or seek to interpret the Vedic sutras and explain the Upanishadic precepts in their practical lives? I don't think this is true of our villagers. As for me, I do not know Sanskrit, nor do I know the grammar of the Vedas. (To confess a professional secret, I do not even know Malayalam grammar.) But during my childhood days, I had listened to my father read out verses from the great Indian epics. This, incidentally, is a regular practice in the Kerala households: verses from the Hindu classical texts are read aloud in the evenings, after supper. I believe that the cultural essence of our village folk owes a good deal to their very close intimacy with our epics. I don't think there is any other place on earth where literature forms the basis, the very life-style, of a people. This intimacy with our cultural lore has ably withstood the turmoils of India's history through the ages. Indianness is not a life-style, nor a mere vision. It is an instru ment a people fashion out with utmost refinement and efficiency in order to maintain a rhythmic balance of their individualistic, social and cultural existence. Values of life are not being for mally dictated from without, from a platform, as it were. They instruct life itself. These are not alien to life, including their insistence on one's belief in God. Ideals are not those that are protected by pure faith. They are open to tests of reason and the dialectic of cause and effect. Anyone can rely safely on Indian literature when he is at a loss to choose between right and wrong. He will discover, then, that his concept of Indianness acts as a guide in this direction. It is not the holy writings com prising the Vedas and the Upanishads, but our great literature that leaves its impact on one's life and one's day-to-day pro blems. The great epics and the hundreds of characters in them continue to guide the common man in India even today. We observe how the political boundary demarcations of Indianness have changed in our history. Has Indianness shrunk to a corresponding degree with the narrowing of its political 68</page><page sequence="5">ON INDIANNESS IN LITERATURE boundaries? No. Indianness came into being not with the advent of the Indo-Aryans with their Vedic hymns. The Indo-Aryans came to a region where a mature civilization had flourished. This has been revealed by the Harappan civilization. Perhaps it is reasonable to summarise that Indianness was bom of the inter action between the Harappan and the Indo-Aryan cultures which lasted for centuries. Whatever be the truth of this sur mise, Indianness is larger than India or any one language in which Indian literature is being composed. Indian literature is the recreation of an artistically exalted Indianness. Mirrored in this literature are not merely those realities of day-to-day life, but a philosophy, an approach, certain values and concepts symbolized by rituals, and a good many other things. The real India is rural India. But, our villages are a discon certing spectacle. Their bitter indigence and illiteracy demons trate that Indianness, great as it is, is practically lifeless. Life stood still in India for a pretty long time even as it moved fast in the other parts of the world. It seems to me that this stillness is quite natural to the Indian grain. Viewed against modern standards, the Indian villages are backward in all res pects. It occurred to some people that a whiff of inspiration from without might breathe new life into this inert body of Indianness. But this attempt at reformation posed a problem: could anything so un-Indian seek to reform India? Be it in Tamil Nadu or Kerala, Rajasthan, Andhra, Uttar Pradesh or Karnataka, Assam or Gujarat, it is in the Indian village that our literature flowers. It was some thirtyfive or forty years ago that Premchand's translations were available to us. And, I suppose, it was through Premchand that we developed our interest in Hindi literature. I still recall someone reviewing Nirmala in Malayalam transla tion. Godan was very popular in Malayalam. The common reader never feels for a moment that life depicted in Premchand's short stories is any different from the reader's own. Barring a few allusions to literary habits or styles of dress, one always feels that those incidents happened in one's own village. Characters 69</page><page sequence="6">INDIAN LITERATURE seem to live in one's place. Their breath touches us as it were. We seem to hear their laughter. It is here that I sense Indianness. Even as the sins of Indianness luridly grin at us, its virtues un fold themselves. At its strongest, Indianness may be seen to uphold life; at its weakest, it drags life out in the open and tramples upon it. The Bengali scenario might be different from that of Uttar Pradesh. Physical appearances of characters might differ too. In Assam or Tamil Nadu, the misery of a seventeen year-old girl married to a seventy-year-old man is the same. When the threat of casteism foils a young man's love for a woman, and he takes to sanyasa, the situation in a Gujarati novel or a Telugu story evokes the same responses and guaran tees an even measure of the reader's appreciation. Throughout the country poor parents of daughters undergo much the same agony in order to accumulate huge sums for the dowry. The Hindu celebrations on the Janmashtami bear a parallel to the Christian celebrations on Christmas. The devout Hindu considers a pilgrimage to Kashi to be his life's end. The Muslim's Haj pilgrimage is an identical act of faith. The pro blems that beset the Indian farmer in a predominantly Feudalist Capitalist society are the same everywhere. If you are sincere to your art, if you have something of your own to say, if you love your people, you are an Indian writer, no matter what language you write in. On this score, all our writers are Indian. Tr.from Malayalam by K. N A RAYANA CHAN DRAN 70</page><page sequence="7">II A.N. MOORTHY RAO WHEN we speak of a literary work as "racy of our soil, genuinely and unmistakably Indian", we intend a compli ment. We mean that the work is steeped in the traditions and culture of our own country; that it gives expression to what wells up naturally from the heart of one who is an inheritor of that culture. There is something in our literature, something rather vague and difficult to define, which marks it out as Indian. But the more we emphasize the national characteristic, the more we may be detracting from its universality. The authenticity of the work, the fact that it 'belongs' in the environment from which it springs—this does give us pleasure. That the environment happens to be Indian is not irrelevent. But in order of import ance it does not come first. The stimulus—it may be nature, man, or an exciting event—strikes a chord within us. That which strikes the chord, and the chord itself, may be something national. But the resulting music is universal. The cultural idiom which we use to give expression to our vision of the world is Indian. But the vision itself is universal in the sense that it may be the experience of persons in any part of the world. More than six decades ago, when the British were ruling us, I read for the first time Shakespeare's poem in honour of England: This royal throne of kings, this sceptr'd isle This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars, This other Eden, demi-paradise, This precious stone set in the silver sea, This blessed spot, this earth, this realm, this England. When reading this I, who could not but think of England as 71</page><page sequence="8">INDIAN LITERATURE the oppressor of my country, was none the less thrilled. Eng land called forth Shakespeare's love, the love called forth the music. The stimulus is 'national' in character; the love is the love of England in particular. But the patriotic spirit and the music are universal. If an Englishman reads Kannada poet Pampa's stanzas of Banavasi he would be thrilled as I was when I read Shakespeare's eulogy of his country. Pampa sings of the mango tree, the champak blossom, and the song of the cuckoo. If he but feels fanned by the south wind, if he but thinks of the spring festival, not even the stab of an ankus can stop his heart flying off to Banavasi. The mango tree, the champok blossom and the spring festival are all Indian, though western poets may dispute Pampa's claim to the song of the cuckoo. But the swel ling heart is universal. It has sometimes been suggested that a serious reflective temperament, a thoughtful spirit seeking to unravel the meaning of life, is what marks a literary work as 'Indian'. Mathew Arnold gives 'the East* credit for 'thought': The East bowed low before the blast In silent deep disdain. She let the legions thunder past And plunged in thought again. Perhaps the East did plunge in thought - in comparison with the Roman legions. It is no great compliment to us! In any case the word 'thought' is far too vague and it is characteristic of Homo Sapiens rather than of any particular country. Perhaps it would be true to say, by and large, that we tend to look inward as contrasted with the West in general which emphasizes action, adventure and an unending quest for new ex perience. The West accuses us of other-worldliness, and we plume ourselves on it. We may not in so many words call our selves other-worldly—we prefer to use the word 'spiritual'. Our philosophy often seems—the accent is on 'seems'—to praise detachment from life at the expense of attachment to life. Actu ally both attitudes are found in our literature and philosophy. In support of our love of life and our joy in it, we may translate 72</page><page sequence="9">ON INDIANNESS IN LITERATURE some time-honoured lines from the Upanishads: With our ears let us hear good (auspicious) things; With our eyes let us see good things; or Let us live for a hundred years; Let us be happy for a hundred years; or May the winds blow sweet as honey, May the rivers flow with honey. We may recall that the great Yajnavalkya did not despise the thousand cows with gold-tipped horns offered by king Janaka. As a counter-weight to all this we may remember that that same Yajnavalkya later decided to give away all his wealth and lead a monastic life. When he offered his wealth to his two wives, one of them, Maitreyi, asked him: "Does this bring me immortal life (amaratva)T, Yajnavalkya's reply was an unam biguous 'No'. Sankara, too, warns us against attachment to life: Your wife, your son— what are they to you? Just think of the eternal monotony of the shows of life: day and night, evening and morning, winter and spring, they come again and again; birth ;¡nd death again and again; and yet again you lie in your mother's womb!1 The prayer that we may be freed from the cycle of births and deaths is heard again and again, and it is not only from as cetic philosophers that we hear it. The sense of the vanity of all earthly things seems—to Kshemendra anyway—to be a natural inference from the Mahabharata: Kaurava enjoyed this earth girdled by the four gem-rich seas, and he fell with his thigh broken in battle. He lay on the battle-field un 1. This is a rough summary. 73</page><page sequence="10">INDIAN LITERATURE attended, and wolves fed upon him when he was yet alive! The world-victor Vijaya (Arjuna) was defeated by cowherds! The Vrishni clan was destroyed by internecine quarrels. Consider all this, and give yourselves over to peace. That this note is not uncommon in our literature is true. But can we take it to be the differentia between Indian and other literatures? Let us take a look at ancient Greek literature. What was the homecoming—after ten years of fighting on the plains of Troy—that awaited the victorious Agamemnon? Death at the hands of his unfaithful wife! How many weary years did Odysseus wander before reaching home—only to find the nobles of Ithaca feasting uninvited in his own hall, and plagu ing his wife! The premature death of Achilles, the mightiest of the Achaeans, was decreed before he was born. What mattered his victory over Hector! He could not be near his father Peleus to comfort his last hours. And Priam, the King of Troy (he too "was once happy", as Achilles reminds us), he had to endure "what no man yet hath endured: to carry to (his) lips the hand of him who slew (his) son." Kshemendra's comment on the Mahabharata ("consider all this and give yourselves over to peace") would be equally appropriate in the Greek context. In some of the Bhavavali stories of the Jains, we pass to renunciation not from misfortune and misery but from success and pleasure. We are led from pleasure (not Ananda, but what the Kathopanishad calls Preyas) to its rejection. Pleasure may disillusion, it may clog, it may teach us the lesson that Yayati took a thousand years to learn: We cannot calm down passion by indulgence in it. Like fire fed by havis, it burns all the more fiercely. To Pampa's Bahubali, enlightenment and renunciation come at the moment when he has the whole world (including his defeat ed brother) at his feet. What he rejects is what he has achieved, not what is beyond him. Kannada poet Ratnakaravarni's Bharata has often been taken to be the symbol of the synthesis of the 74</page><page sequence="11">ON INDIANNESS IN LITERATURE opposites—Tyaga and Bhoga, i.e., renunciation and indulgence. Perhaps it is not quite accurate to put it that way. Bharata passes from Tyaga to Bhoga; but there is a time-gap between the two. They do not blend. The perfect unity, the transcen dence of dualism, we find in Siva. He is the possessor of all wealth and he is lavish in his gifts to suppliants; and yet his own garment is just a skin. His body is a compound of himself and his beloved—he is Ardhanarisvara, and yet in freedom from passion he outstrips all ascetics. I love to think that this is the ideal we Indians prize most. We fall terribly short of it. All too often, let us admit it, our renun ciation is little more than the inability to acquire something to renounce. But we do have the ideal before us. Siva is not the symbol of the rejection of life. When life is lived at His level, enjoyment of life is not inconsistent with Vairagya (renuncia tion). In Him, the attachment-detachment dualism is trans cended. But in spite of the fact that our racial genius has created this sublime figure, in spite of the emphasis on the sweetness of life in the excerpts from our scriptures cited earlier, it is true that in later Indian literature we do not hear enough of the sheer joy of life, the joy that makes the 'young lambs bound as to the tabor's sound", and "the babe leap up in the mother's arms", nor enough of the Ulysses-spirit of soaring ambition and the insatiable thirst for new and ever new experience. Perhaps we looked away from this world too often to a world beyond. There was a time when the Indian sought to shine in the realm of the stars with his own unborrowed radiance; a time when he shook his fist in the face of the gods and said, "I shall create ano ther Indra". But that was in the distant past. For ages we seem to have been satisfied with a lifeless simulation of that spirit. But the spirit was there deep down within us waiting for release. A change came with the renaissance in the third decade of this century. True, a literature of disillusion and frustration was to come again. But it was preceded by an outburst of joy and a quivering sensitiveness to the beauty of Nature and of all 75</page><page sequence="12">INDIAN LITERATURE life. Among Kannada writers, Kuvempu never tires of singing of the beauty of Nature. P.T. Narasimhachar cautions the delu ded ascetic Gautama (borrowed from Valmiki) to wake up to the claims of life in this human world; and in his 'Gokula Nirgamana' we have once again the ecstasy of Krishna's flute, though in the distance looms a world in which steel—not music —is effective. Bendre sings of a joy that embraces the whole universe, of a cosmic dance to which day and night keep time. (It is the same Bendre that describes dance of a very different kind—the frightful dance of the blind demon, gold!) Other worldliness, turning one's back on life, cannot, then, be said to be the distinguishing characteristic of Indian literature. The questioning spirit evident in Indian literature of this century has generally been taken to be the result of our contact with the literature and philosophy of the West. It can, with justice, be argued that we have only to look into our own past to find rebellion against accepted tradition. But none the less it is true that while we were aware that rebellion is also part of our tradition, that awareness was accentuated and made dynamic by contact with recent western thought. In India today there seems to be a genuine hunger for religion—not always fed on honey-dew and the milk of paradise! But along with it we also find an uneasy and sometimes even scornful feel ing that the house of faith is built on shifting sands. Faith, agnosticism, scepticism, despair—all of them have always been there in man. One or the other of these attitudes comes up uppermost in response to some powerful stimulus—it may be heart-searching induced by the gospel of a great saint, a destruction of values as the result of a world war, or some epoch-making discovery of science. They are not peculiar to any one country though they may arise in one country and then spread to another. The Charvaka exhortation ("Be happy while you have life. Borrow money and swill ghee; for, once the body is reduced to ashes, it will not come back") may be matched by "Gather the rose-buds while you may" or "Eat, drink and be merry; for tomorrow ye die". It is a'mood of despair which 76</page><page sequence="13">ON INDIANNESS IN LITERATURE creeps over all of us when the wheels of our being run slow. Of the many solutions that have been given to the problem of will and suffering, the least unsatisfactory seems to be Karma theory. In one form or another, it has permeated our life, our literature and our philosophy. Here is a thing which we can call our own, something which is distinctly and unmistakably Indian. It bears some resemblance to the character-destiny nexus of Shakespearean tragedy. In the Oresteian trilogy of Aeschylus, the nexus is not confined to one generation. Each generation con tributes its own quota of sin, adds its own link to the chain of evil. Starting from the banquet of Thyestes (if we do not want to go further back) we pass through the sacrifice of Iphigenia and the murder of Agamemnon by Clytemnestra to the killing by Orestes of his own mother. It is only by divine grace that the chain of evil is broken. Most Indians believe that Karma is worked out not in one life-time as in Shakespearean tragedy, but in life after life until (according to one school anyway) the final liberation which comes only when we pay in full for what we do. If we accept the theory that everybody can be sure of ultimate salvation, we may infer that there will be a slight bias in the right direction in each generation, and that there will thus be a progressive lessening of evil. Clear knowledge of what is good and what is evil would help. The deity also may be called in to serve as Karmadhyaksha, a sort of supervisor of the Karma process. But the liberation is really achieved by ourselves. Our mythological stories seem to tell us that even when the gods (thoughtlessly?) grant boons to evil-doers, the law of Karma circumvents the boon and destroys the evil-doer. Nobody, however great, is exempted from the operation of the law. We may remember that even Dharmaraja had to have a glimpse of hell because of the one lie he uttered. This brings us to the characteristic most distinctive of our epics: the emphasis on Dharma. No version of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, whether in Sanskrit or in other Indian languages, fails to stress this. It is, of course, an oversimplifica 77</page><page sequence="14">INDIAN LITERATURE tion to say that to the Greeks the great man was the strong man—one remembers Aeschylus. Homer, too, makes us feel that Achilles is greatest when he is in a tenderly reflective mood. It is none the less true to say that Dharma does not figure as prominently in Homeric epics as it does in our epics. "Where there is Dharma there is victory" is a stale enough quotation. But we realize its profound significance if we recall the context in which the statement occurs. Duryodhana asked for his mother's blessing just before going to the battle field. Her answer, given with an aching heart was: "Where there is Dharma, there is victory." She remembers and mentions this to Krishna looking on the blood-stained body of her son. The characters in our epics do swerve again and again from the ideal; but it is there all the time. The reader is never allowed to forget it. The slaying of Vali, the rejection of Sita, the fight between Kama and Arjuna, the mace-fight between Duryodhana and Bhima, in every episode whether the judgement pronounced (if it is pronounced) is right or not, the reference to the ideal of Dharma is clear and unmistakable. Vyasa sums it up in the puzzled question: With arms upraised I shout: "It is from Dharma that the other values—Artha and Kama- flow. Why is it not followed! But nobody listens to me." In this context it is interesting to contrast the Alcestis story with our Yayati and Savitri stories. Yayati and Admetus draw level so far as Adharma is concerned. Both are utterly selfish and both demand from loved ones a sacrifice which they them selves should have been ready to make for the loved ones. Perhaps the sex-hungry Yayati is worse than Adametus—he is old enough to have grown-up sons! In the Savitri story, no sacri fice is demanded. Savitri's penance is self-imposed. The Indian story resembles the Greek one only in the matter of the struggle with the god of death for another's life. The contrast lies in the fact that while in the Greek story death is conquered by phy sical force, in our story it is love and Dharma (here the two 78</page><page sequence="15">ON INDIANNESS IN LITERATURE are identical) that conquer. One other feature which is almost exclusively characteristic of our life and literature is the nature of the relation between us and our gods. The Greek gods sometimes stand shoulder to shoulder on the battle-field with their favourite heroes. But they would not brook any slight and would not tolerate laughter at their expense. Apollo could put a curse upon Cassandra whom he loved; and Athene could cast illusion on Ajax and gloatingly watch him shedding the blood of dumb animals in the fury of his madness. Like the Homeric gods our gods also are anthropomorphic. But our variety of anthropomorphism seems to enrich our gods without lowering their moral stature (This remark does not apply to Indra. Some stories of Siva and Vishnu would also be exceptions). They do not sit on their thrones in awful majesty, remote and unapproachable. They can suffer for us, laugh at us, wrestle with us good-humouredly; and they can also permit us to take liberties with them. If we remember that they are the gods of a live and operative religion—not of a dead one as are the Homeric gods—the point becomes more significant. In our attitude towards our gods there is reverence; but it is often mixed with intimacy. In the household of the gods we also belong. Good-natured banter does not, therefore, seem out of place. For example, Siva and Gauri are, as Kalidasa puts it, one as Word and Meaning are one. Yet many a folk-song plays with the notion of rivalry between Gauri and Ganga, and attributes jealously to them. Kalidasa himself does it. The old myth of the descent of Ganga is turned topsy-turvy in popular (and poetic) imagination. In the myth, it is Ganga that is humbled. But in the folk-songs it is Gauri that is humbled. Kalidasa's Ganga (in the Meghasandesa) laughs in derision at the frown on Gauri's face as she (Ganga) catches hold of Siva's hair. There is a floating stanza which has as its subject-matter a practical joke played by Heramba on his parents. Heramba sees that his parents are at the same moment seized by a desire to kiss him. Siva and Gauri both thrust out their faces towards the 79</page><page sequence="16">INDIAN LITERATURE son who is sitting between them. Heramba suddenly withdraws his face and Siva and Gauri find themselves kissing each other while the son laughs. Then there is the Bhakta (devotee) who claims to have scored one over an apparently slow-witted God. The Tamil poet Manikka Vachagar has given himself to the Lord. He is no longer his own master. But he chuckles and says to God, "Now you have got me ('just poor me', he means). But see what I have got in return. 1 have got you (the Lord of the Universe)! Tell me, which of us is the cleverer?" Manikka Vachagar's humility and his realization of the immensity of God's love forus find expression in delightfully quaint humour. These three—the Karma theory, the emphasis on Dharma, and the intimacy with the gods—help to give our literature the stamp of Indianness. But more subtly interfused though less easy to isolate or define, is what we may call our cultural idiom. This is the means by which our vision of the universal is expres sed. The great myths of India, the Vedas and the Upanishads, the epics and the puranas, our family system, the rituals and festivals observed by us, the mountains and rivers to which we attach sanctity—all these contribute to the formation of that idiom. It appears everywhere—in household talk, in light-hearted banter, and in serious literature. The examples that follow may give some idea of the simpler and more obvious forms of that idiom. A wicked uncle becomes 'Uncle Kamsa', and a deceitful one becomes 'Uncle Sakuni'. Any long story becomes, in common parlance, 'Ramayana'—the use of the word in such contexts does not involve any context for Valmiki's work. Phrases like 'Bhishma Pratijna', 'Sugrivajna' are in common use. More than anything else, it is this cultural idiom that gives our literature its Indian flavour. 80</page></plain_text>
