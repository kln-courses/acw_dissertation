THE TERMS "HOLY SPIRIT," "DIVINE LIGHT" AND THEIR EQUIVALENTS IN HALLEVI THE second group of terms used by Hallevi in connec- tion with prophecy which, unlike the term al-amr al-ildhiyy in its primary meaning, refers to something which has real existence as a creation of God, contains the following six terms: (1) Holy Spirit,87 (2) Ray of Divine Light or Divine Light,88 (3) Glory of God, (4) Kingdom of God, (5) Shekinah,89 and (6) Messengership of God.90 These terms, with the exception of the Light of God, are quoted by him within the Arabic text in their original Hebrew form, although in his presentation of the philosophic view on prophecy, as we have seen above, the term Holy 87 wpn ,mn (II, 4). 88 ,n i -I1 YI'x,3 (II, 8); 'n^ r, n1iN (III, 17). 89 ', nmri 'n, nm lr 'n nlza (IV, 3). Hirschfeld's edition reads here 'n nri~ml both in the Arabic (p. 244, 1. 20) and in the Hebrew (p. 245, 1. 26) text. But this is obviously a corruption, for the following reasons: (1) In the explanation which immediately follows there is the quota- tion ~rtv :n= inlAm (Ps. 103.19).

The term nrio is used by Hallevi as the equivalent of mnz:, after the expression ninl:u 11n: (Ps. 145.11), and it refers to the visible manifestation of God on earth. It is to be distinguished from the term KDDm nli?n: oD'D nmlD (III, 1) which he uses in the sense of the kingdom of God above. go :1I 'n nlmrm 'n -ii'n (II, 7); nin,i , 'i 'in nmzini (IV, 3). Cf. Haggai 1.13. 49</page><page sequence="2">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Spirit is quoted in its Arabic form9' and although also the term Kingdom with reference to God and the term Shekinah occur also in Arabic.92 The inference to be drawn from this is that in his discussion of the terms "Holy Spirit," "Glory of God," "Kingdom of God," "Shekinah" and "Messenger- ship of God" he meant to interpret certain traditional Hebrew terms found in Scripture or in talmudic literature. As for "Divine Light," though allusions to it are to be found in Scripture and talmudic literature, at the time of Hallevi it was not yet crystallized into a technical Hebrew term. Of these six terms, one term of which we have the clearest definition is Holy Spirit, with its equivalents, the terms Spirit of God93 and Spirit.94 It is defined by Hallevi as a "subtle spiritual substance" from which by the will of God are formed those "spiritual forms"95 which "appear to the prophets"96 during their prophetic experience. These "spiritual forms" arise by the divine will97 out of this "subtle spiritual substance," called Holy Spirit, by means of a "ray of divine light" or a "divine light"98 which acts upon the Holy Spirit, after the analogy of the action of the rays of sunlight upon the clouds which produce the colors of the rainbow.99 As in the case of the sun and the ray of 91 Cf. above, nn. 20, 21. 92, _&lt;C.

The "Holy Spirit" or "the subtle spiritual substance" cor- responds to the clouds in the phenomenon of the rainbow.100 ,oo Cuzari, II, 7. Hallevi does not explicitly distinguish between Holy Spirit and Divine Light and, as we shall see (below, n. 121), no distinction is made between them by Saadia. But from the analogy he draws in II, 7, between Divine Light and sunlight and his reference in the case of the latter to the relation between sunlight and the bodies affected by it on a cloudy day Kol Yehudah infers that the relation between the Divine Light and the Holy Spirit is like that of an active principle to a passive principle. Kol Yehudah's interpretation is based upon Shem Tob's comment on Maimonides' reference to the rainbow in Moreh Nebukim, III, 7, which in its turn is based upon Narboni's comment on the same reference in Maimonides. This interpretation of Cool Yehudah, Shem Tob and Narboni, as I shall show in the sub- sequent paragraph, has a historical foundation. Cf.

While the analogy of the rainbow definitely reflects the passage in</page><page sequence="4">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW The "spiritual forms" are thus the result of the action of the ray of the divine light upon the Holy Spirit, the latter being related to the former as an active principle to a passive principle, or as form to matter. Now this conception of Hallevi that there is a "subtle spiritual substance" which is acted upon by Divine Light as its form reflects a Neoplatonic view. Hallevi's "subtle spiritual substance" corresponds to that divine (OeLa)ror or intelligible (vorT)10?2 matter (v[Xr) or substance (ovoaia)103 of which Plotinus speaks. Similarly Hallevi's Divine Light corresponds to that light (sojs) which, according to Plotinus, proceeds from God and illuminates the intelligible matter, and which with reference to that matter is called reason (X6yos))04 by which is meant form (etlos).I?5 This Neoplatonic conception of an intelligible matter of which the form is spoken of as light was wide- spread in Arabic philosophy. Taking but one example of Arabic Jewish philosophy, we may mention Avicebron who similarly speaks of an "intelligible" or "spiritual matter"106 as being acted upon by an "intelligible light" which emanates from the word or will of God and is described as form.107 Let us now see what becomes of the remaining terms, Aristotle referred to above (n. 99), the argument that the sunlight is not identical with the sun and that the rainbow is not identical with the sunlight reflects Plato's argument, in his analogy of the sun with the idea of good, that just as "light and vision" are like the sun but not identical with it so also "knowledge and truth" are like the idea of good but not identical with it (Rep., VI, 508E-509A).

These terms are said by Hallevi to be used as general designations of those "spiritual forms" which appear to prophets at the time of their receiving the prophetic com- munication. Not being physical forms, they are not perceived by all the people by means of the ordinary sense- perceptions, but they are in some miraculous way per- ceived by the prophets when they are possessed of the prophetic spirit and sometimes also by other privileged persons for whom the prophetic message was intended. These "spiritual forms" are such phenomena mentioned in Scripture as "a pillar of cloud" (Num. 12.5), "consuming fire" (Ex. 24.17), "a thick cloud" (Ex. 19.9), "the thick darkness" (Ex. 20.21), "fire" (Deut. 5.19), "brightness" (Ezek. 1.28),'?8 "the cloud" (Ex. 16.10), "the image of God" (Gen. 1.27), "the similitude of the Lord" (Num. 12.8),'09 "the pillar of fire" (Ex. 13.22), and "a paved work of sapphire stone" (Ex. 24.10).TIO But evidently Hallevi makes a distinction between the terms Glory of God, Kingdom of God and Shekinah on the one hand and the term Messengership of God on the other. The former terms are general descriptions of any of the phenomena which appear to the prophet at the time of his prophetic experience. The term Messengership of God, however, applies to that particular phenomenon which is called in Scripture "angel," who appears as the bearer of a 108 Cuzari, II, 7: D',1m onwiV nzm' nl,~ i m Inz 'n 11n 1p m=n ,I inal .I) 1 BRI ^M-iy i l nzl r lbt wvbl 1Y -iny nmw 10a wtvmn tK m 0'D'f-3 0'-m I?.

According to this view, then, the angels of Scripture are like all the other temporary perceptible phenomena by which the prophetic experience is attended, except, Hallevi seems to intimate, that unlike all those other temporary phenomena which, as he has said, are created from that "subtle spiritual substance," called "Holy Spirit," these temporary angels are created out of "the subtle elementary bodies," by which he presumably means the four simple elements.T" Out of which of these elements the temporary angels are created he does not specify. But if his statement here has reference to the talmudic statement about ephemeral angels who are created out of the "fiery stream" mentioned in Daniel 7.10,"2 then they are created out of the element fire."3 There is, how- ever, continues Hallevi, another class of angels, who have a permanent existence, and of this class of angels he is willing to admit that they may be identical with what the philosophers call Intelligences, even though for himself he has dispensed with the Intelligences as intermediary causes of the motions of the spheres."4 This class of angels who like the Intelligences of the philosophers are of permanent existence consist, according to Hallevi, not of "the subtle elementary bodies," i. e., the four elements, but rather of that "subtle spiritual body" which he calls Holy Spirit and which, as we have seen, corresponds to what Plotinus calls the "intelligible matter.""I Similarly with regard to the visions seen by Isaiah, Ezekiel and Daniel, such as the "throne," the "chariot," II Ibid. o.KDmK) O'p'-in -1D' '1,n i 1n lnyi mly5 ~ 'n , t, ' 1s~ml 112 Iag. 14a.

But from the context as well as from his description of them as "spiritual" it may be gathered that he considered them as having been created out of that "subtle spiritual substance" which he calls Holy Spirit. With regard to the term Glory of God, which on the whole he regards as a general term descriptive of the totality of the spiritual phenomena which appear at the time of the prophetic experience, Hallevi discerns in it also three other usages. (1) It is used as the equivalent of Holy Spirit and is accordingly defined by him as a "subtle substance,""7 by which he evidently means, as he says of the Holy Spirit, a subtle spiritual body. (2) It is used as the equivalent of the "Ray of Divine Light," i. e., as the principle which acts as a form in its relation to the Holy Spirit, and accordingly he says that "the glory of God is a ray of the divine light.""8 (3) It is used as a general term designating the totality of those permanent celestial beings, such as angels, Throne, Chariot, Firmament and Wheels or the Wheelwork and others like them."9 These speculations about the meaning of the term "Glory of God" and its use by Hallevi as a designation of the totality of the immaterial beings created by God have I6 Ibid. ny Dm'wznni on am .I'1m prtnm, i,pSv' wn nD: psDn 'n In:~ m,n n",un ny;m hy 'i ... mn,"pn nr3nnrn nmnp In K I-nXn UTI lrin Dwaim1 aDm1Ki y'pni -in-D1 KDi Ot"4a-ninn: oam DKt^Dn ^ID.

But in the en- cyclopedia of the Ibwan al-$afa the term kursiyy is taken to refer to the sphere of the fixed stars and 'arsh is taken to refer to the starless or ninth sphere (cf. Rasa'il, ed. Bombay, 1305 A. H.

In the vague utterances about the "Holy Spirit" and the "Shekinah" in talmudic literature there is indeed some- times the undoubted implication that they are real beings created by God. But there is never any definite statement that they are permanent beings, after the manner of the Logos and the Holy Spirit in Christianity, acting as inter- mediaries between God and men in the process of His com- munication with them. Hallevi, accordingly, interprets these terms as certain temporary visible manifestations Werk fiber die muhammadanische Glaubenslehre," ZDMG, XX [1866], 28, n. 20). Consequently when the Hebrew translates here 'arsh by yp' it undoubtedly means thereby the sphere of the fixed stars, i. e., the eighth sphere, and when it translates kursiyy by KDz which is above the y,p- it undoubtedly means thereby the starless or ninth sphere (cf. below, nn. 207, 208, 210).

The expression "the word of God" of Scripture and post-scriptural literature is not directly dealt with by Hallevi. In so far as it is implied in the term al-amr al-ildhiyy it has all the.variety of meaning of that term. With the explanation of these terms which come into play in Hallevi's theory of prophecy, we may now sketch the outline of that theory itself. ?4. HALLEVI'S THEORY OF PROPHECY Prophecy, according to Hallevi, comes to man by the amr ilahiyy, that is to say, by God's wisdom, power, decree, dominion, command, love or will, but, he adds, that in the process of the prophetic experience, God shows to the prophet certain "spiritual forms" which are formed out of the Holy Spirit by the action of the Divine Light, these forms being known as Glory, Kingdom, Shekinah, and angels. It is in this sense that he says that "the speech of a prophet at the time when he is enwrapped by the Holy Spirit is in every part directed by the amr ilahiyy,"127 or that the term "spirit" used in Scripture in connection with prophecy refers "to the Holy Spirit which enwraps the prophet at the time of his uttering the prophecy,"128 or that the servant of God who is exiled from the Holy Land "does not attach himself to the Divine Light so thathe may become familiar with it as the prophets,"129 or that philosophers had to have recourse to speculation "on account of the absence of prophecy and Divine Light among them."130 In all these passages the amr ildhiyy 127 Cuzari, V, 20: oDnn-oI 3: vpn minmo nlwav ny D''ym,,:n im-I 'z (,nKbesK IDKin ) 'n,n ly In ln 1iz. 228 Ibid., IV, 15: Nl:mn nry ',3n r nvln vmpn mi ny n 13 niln.

The amr ildhiyy of Hallevi, then, is nothing but the "divine will" and it is used by him merely for the purpose of denying that prophecy is a straight natural process of knowledge and of introducing into it an element of election by the Grace of God. In fact Hallevi himself sometimes uses the term "will" for amr and says that they both mean the same thing to him.131 By his use of this term Hallevi has merely aligned himself with all religious prophecy a special gift of God. This then is his first point of departure from what he represented as the philosophic conception of prophecy. Then he departs from the philosophic conception of prophecy on a second point. He eliminates the Active Intellect as an intermediary between God and man in the prophetic experience. Prophecy to him belongs to those acts which he describes as "divine," using the term "divine" in the sense that it is an act caused directly by the will of God without any intermediary causes, be they natural or volitional.132 If angels sometimes appear as bearers of God's message to man, such angels are especially created by God for that purpose and they serve only as attending circumstances in the prophetic experience, such as the cloud, for instance, from the midst of which God may communicate His word to the people.133 The knowledge I31 Cuzari, II, 6: inxn nKN KIN (KnID) -mni i (mnKN-) yn rnK iniK Ki1p.

To begin with, he eliminates that which the philosophers call intellectual perfection. Speculation and deduction and the knowledge of the arts and the sciences, he repeats in a variety of ways, do not prepare one for the divine gift of prophecy.136 Then, as for what the philosophers call moral qualities, and right conduct, they are indeed necessary, but they are primary virtues and are not subordinate to intellectual virtues. Further- more, the moral qualities and the right conduct which prepare one for the gift of prophecy are not those vague moral virtues for the attainment of which philosophers, in their unaccustomed humility, hesitate to prescribe a defi- nite mode of action and tell you to choose your own religion or your own non-religion. They are, according to Hallevi, the way of life prescribed in the Law of Moses137 134 Ibid., I, 42: nn ,notm Kn m n,n1m D n'n;K [K'n] nm;rn nYD;n 5 'rwDn 31D 1i (,'PYsm) Dtwn 1D Ki ,I(nnK nn KS) ,'nSn 1'Yn 1-D (,y,Y:K) 'Yun [1D] bi1 (1i]n= DK=,s ;'3D3'K=).

Finally, he adds two conditions, essential to prophecy, which are: First, prophecy is confined to the Jewish race only, who alone by a certain process of selection have inherited a predisposition for it from Adam who was created directly by God with a special predisposition for the gift of proph- ecy.'38 None of the other human races, though all of them are descendants of Adam, has inherited that particular predisposition for prophecy, and consequently, since this prophetic gift is a matter of heredity, it cannot be attained by one who is born of another race, even if he becomes converted to the Jewish religion.I39 Second, besides the racial condition of prophecy, there is also a geographical condition. Prophecy can flourish only in Palestine and, if we do find prophets who flourished outside of Palestine, it is because the burden of their prophecy was Palestine.140 There are several phases in Hallevi's theory of prophecy which reflect certain theological tendencies in the general history of the problem but which can be best and more fully treated in connection with other problems. But here we should like to comment upon his view that prophecy is confined to the Jewish race. This view, which Hallevi so vehemently upholds, was more current in Christianity than in Judaism. There is of course no such restriction in the Bible. In talmudic literature the view is expressed in a variety of ways that prophecy existed also among other 38 Ibid., I, 95. 139 Ibid., I, 115: ,nn'tmn ' n'mn t y ilnnnmn Dmn nam mr ntn, R t i 3Pyl D,'Dlllm D',=n ,n,m' 0DnD l',p',t p ,3y n9,~n on~ln ,rm=I=1 , DO"'n D'1 D: O''IN Ni j4.

Among the Church Fathers, however, the view appeared that prophecy was confined to Jews, probably to enable them to transfer it, after the Jewish rejection of Jesus, exclusively to Christians. Thus Justin Martyr, addressing Trypho, says: "For prophetical gifts remain with us even to this time, from which you ought to under- stand that those which were formerly lodged with your 14I The most characteristic of such statements is that in which seven non-Jewish prophets are enumerated. Cf. Baba Batra 15b. 142 As, e. g., the statement that "when God causes His Shekinah to alight, He lets it alight only on families in Israel of traceable descent" (Kid. 70b), which is quoted in Ozar Ne.mad on Cuzari, I, 115, as the source of Hallevi's view.

But evidently in order to safeguard the belief in the subsequent exclusiveness of prophecy to Christians, he speaks of all those non-Jewish prophets as belonging to that "heavenly fellowship," "the true Israel- ites," which had existed as the prototype of Christianity even before the advent of Christ.rso Thus Hallevi's con- ception of prophecy as an exclusive gift of the Jews has its parallel, if not its origin, in non-Jewish literature. In view, however, of the fact that prophecy is considered in Judaism as being of various degrees, it is not impossible that, when Hallevi speaks of prophecy as being restricted to Jews, he has reference only to a special kind of prophecy. In fact, Hallevi himself says that a non-Jew may become a waliyy, which Arabic term, though translated into Hebrew .asid, pious person, is to be taken here to mean a prophet of a lower grade as contrasted with nabiyy, which I46 Dialogus cum Tryphone, 82. 147 Excerpta ex Theodoto, 54 (ed.

Dei, XVIII, 47.</page><page sequence="16">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW means here a higher grade of prophet and hence a prophet in the true sense of the term.5'l Similarly one of the most characteristic expressions used by Hallevi in describing the selection of Israel comes from a non-Jewish source, where it was used as a description of a non-Jewish people. The expression in question is Hallevi's description of the Jews as the heart, in the figurative sense of essence and purest part, of the nations.'52 This Is5 Cf. Cuzari, I, 115: D-'T,rom n,n n,rri Drno 1p,v m)y n,3rn Dnfilr (,,3mt) D',,, 'tI N (,51~I). Elsewhere (V, 20, p. 342, 11. 23-24; p. 343, 11. 18-19), Hallevi attributes to waliyy, 'tDn, as contrasted with nabiyy, "'m, 'divine inspiration," ilhdmdt, rn1?3, evidently as con- trasted with waky, ncl3, concerning which terms see above n. 20. It is not impossible that the waliyy of Hallevi corresponds to the lowest of the three degrees of prophecy enumerated by Abraham bar Hiyya in Megillat ha-Megalleh, II, p. 41, 11. 10 ff. (As to the origin of that threefold classification, see Guttmann's Introduction to that work, pp. XVIII-XIX). That Hallevi should designate the lowest degree of prophecy by a different term is quite understandable. So also Mai- monides says that the prophet of his two lowest degrees of prophecy is not to be called nabiyy, ,m:, in the true sense of the term (cf. below nn. 187, 188). It may be observed that, whenever in the Hebrew translation of the Cuzari, the term Itasid occurs as a description of a merely pious person the underlying Arabic term is not waliyy but rather hayyir (III, 1, 2 3, 4, 5, 11; V, 16) or fdil (III, 17, 21) or taqiyy (III, 31). I52 Hallevi uses the following Arabic terms for "heart" with its derivative meanings of "essence," "best part," etc. All of these are translated into Hebrew by 3=.

He says: "We are the heart of men, men are the heart of animals, animals are the heart of plants, plants are the heart of minerals, minerals are the heart of the elements, and so we are the heart of hearts."I53 Evidently in using these Iraqian words Hallevi meant to reclaim for the Jews that distinctive position among the religions of the world which later other peoples have arrogated to themselves in their belief of being the rightful successors to the Jews. In fact, some of the phrases used by Hallevi in praise of Palestine and the Jews seem to be aimed directly at that Iraqian's speech in praise of his own country and his own people.

These Ten Commandments, says Philo, "God judged fit to deliver in His own person alone, without employing any other" and these laws "which He gave in His own person and by His own mouth alone include both laws in general and the heads of particular laws."162 Else- where for "heads of particular laws" he uses the expression "the ten generic laws"'63 or "the generic heads, roots and principles of the vast multitude of particular laws, being the everlasting source of all the ordinances."'64 Moreover, as he goes on, Philo stresses the fact that the Ten Com- mandments were spoken by God with "clearness and dis- tinctness" and that they reached the ears of the people in an "articulate voice."'65 The similarities are striking, '60 Cuzari, I, 87.

More striking still is the similarity between Philo and Hallevi in their treatment of the question of anthropo- morphism that is involved in the story of the revelation on Mount Sinai, in the statement that the voice of God was heard by the people. In his explanation of this anthropomorphism Philo says that it was not a physical voice with which God addressed the people, "for God is not like a man in need of a mouth and a tongue and a windpipe."'68 What really happened there is that God "wrought a miracle of a truly holy kind." He ordered "an invisible (i. e., an immaterial) sound to be created in the air," a sound which was "a rational soul full of clearness and distinctness," and this "invisible sound" or "rational soul" transformed the air into "a flaming fire" and sounded forth a loud "articulate I66 Cf., for instance, the statement that the tablets of the Ten Com- mandments contained all the laws of the Torah (Song of Songs Rab., 5.14, 2).

Like Philo, he describes that voice as a miracle created by God for that particular occasion, a miracle like all the other miracles recorded in Scripture, the chief one among which is the creation of the world. Unlike Philo, however, he does not undertake to describe how that "articulate voice" which the people heard proceeded from that "invisible voice" which God created in the air. But he seems to have Philo in mind when he says: "We do not know how God's thought became corporealized so that it was transformed into speech which struck our ear, nor what new thing God created out of that which had no existence, nor again what existing thing did He employ [in creating this new thing]; for [all we know is that] God does not lack the power [to do any of these things]."'7' And consequently, "just as He created the heaven and the stars by His will alone... [and just as] the water stood at His command, and shaped itself at His will, so the air which touched the prophet's ear was shaped into sounds of letters, which conveyed the thoughts to be communicated by God to the prophet and the people."172 169 Ibid., ?33.

MAIMONIDES' THEORY OF PROPHECY Of the five points in the philosophic conception of prophecy, the first point is explicitly rejected by Mai- monides. Disagreeing with the philosophers on their first point, he does not believe that the state of prophecy must follow by necessity as a result of one's natural, moral and intellectual perfection. "For we believe," he says, "that, even he who is naturally fit for prophecy and has pre- pared himself for it may yet not actually prophesy, for the act of prophecy depends upon the divine will, and according to my opinion it is a miraculous act like all miracles and it occurs in the same manner."173 The term used by him for "will" in this connection is the Arabic mashi'ah, used by Hallevi as the equivalent of amr ildhiyy,174 and once he even uses the term amr ildhiyy as the eqiva- lent of mashi'ah in describing the cause of prophecy. This use of the term amr ildhiyy occurs in a passage where he says that "al-amr al-ildhiyy necessarily obliges everyone who has obtained some perfection to transmit it to others, as we shall explain it later in the chapters on prophecy."'75 '73 Moreh Nebukim, II, 32(3): n I,xy l'3,n nr:mi ',lin' nRD li nmw Dt nisn imo3- nin nnx41 (f'rNbi6 m'W:o) D'ni 1t li -in Nti bown HKw -WS D2man3D ?ODf31. 174 Cuzari, V, 20: ."n-in:n ,n o",npr o D',,ym oN i'nb 1I,n o',ynn 0'nrn l]iXn nblt n=oD on 1' 0a,D i: by ',l,X1 nim-in n=onD =,,nbrm D;,:n -i: znpn mr i m Dn nDw':l ny: D'',:rn 1:i ' ...

He agrees with them in their second point that prophecy, though dependent upon divine will, is not a direct act of God. With the philosophers he believes that God acts by the intermediary of the Active Intellect, so that in his formal definition of prophecy he says that "prophecy, in its truth and essence, is a free grace flowing from God through the medium of the Active Intellect to man's rational faculty first and then to his imagination faculty."'78 The only exception to this general theory of prophecy is Moses, who according to the generally accepted view based on Scripture, received his prophetic com- munications directly from God and not by any inter- mediary.179 He also agrees with the philosophers on their 176 Ibid., II, 39.

A. M. Goichon, loc. cit., and Leo Strauss, op. cit., p. 117, n. 4; cf. above, n. 23). Maimonides, however, was not hampered by such a consideration and hence he stressed intellectual perfection as an essential condition of prophecy for every- body, without any exception. As for Mohammed, he allusively places him within that class of people of whom he says that "the influence [of the Active Intellect] extends only to their imaginative faculty, their rational faculty remaining untouched by it, on account either of an innate deficiency in it or of a neglect in training," and among 72</page><page sequence="25">HALLEVI AND MAIMONIDES ON PROPHECY-WOLFSON 73 their fourth point that moral virtues and practical virtues are subordinate to intellectual virtues.'83 But as for the fifth point of the philosophers, namely, that there is no special virtue in any particular mode of conduct for the attainment of prophecy, Maimonides is not quite clear, for it is somewhat uncertain whether Mai- monides insisted upon the particular practices prescribed by the Jewish religion as an essential condition leading to divine gift of prophecy. He does indeed take great pains to show that all the six hundred and thirteen command- ments of the Law have for their purpose the development of intellectual, moral and practical virtues.'84 But it is not clear whether non-Jews, who are not bound by all these six hundred and thirteen commandments and who according to Maimonides attain the status of "pious gentiles" by the observance of the Noachian laws only,'85 would be ex- cluded by him from the gift of prophecy. Equally vague is he in his direct discussion of the problem whether non- Jews, properly qualified by natural disposition and moral and intellectual qualities perfection, can attain the gift of prophecy. In his Iggeret Teman he argues against what he describes as the vulgar view that no non-Jew can become a prophet and refers to Job and Zophar and Bildad and Eliphaz and Elihu, all of whom were non-Jews, and still, whom, he adds, some persons, "even while they are awake, perceive strange apparitions and dreams and astonishing images, and these are so much like a prophetic vision that they believe themselves to be prophets" (Moreh Nebukim, II, 37).

As a result of his view that prophecy requires intel- lectual perfection, Maimonides could not accept the view of both Philo and Hallevi that the revelation on Mount Sinai was a direct prophetic experience partaken of by the entire people. To him it was only Moses who heard "dis- tinct words"; the people heard only a "sound," the meaning of which had to be explained to them by Moses.189 More- over, even that indistinct sound was heard by the people only in the case of the first two Commandments. In the case of the remaining eight Commandments, they heard not even the sound of the voice of God. These eight Com- mandments were communicated to the people through Moses.190 He agrees, however, with both Philo and Hallevi in describing that indistinct sound of the first two Com- mandments as having been "created," i. e., as having been created as a miracle especially for that occasion. He thus refers to it as the "created sound from which the intelligible word was derived."'9' Elsewhere he similarly says that the term "to say" or "to speak," when it refers to some communication from God, implies that that com- munication was either by means of a "created sound" or by means of one of the several degrees of prophecy.192 I89 Ibid., II, 33: n';n si omin KDnln 1 Ipn 13yv, m ? ,n m:a n , (Dtmm5s 5'?xn) D'O=ln.

With regard to the term Holy Spirit, he seems to reject Hallevi's use of it in the sense of a "subtle spiritual sub- stance" which, as we have seen, means the Neoplatonic "intelligible matter." To Maimonides the terms Holy Spirit and Spirit of God and Spirit are to be understood only as descriptions of the gift of prophecy in general'93 or more particularly as descriptions of the first and second of the eleven degrees of prophecy.194 Nor does he agree with Hallevi in his conception of the term Messengership of God, i. e., angels. The angels, whom he identifies with the separate Intelligences, are free of any matter.'95 Here we have the counterpart in Arabic, Jewish as well as Moslem, philosophy of a contro- versy which is to be found later in mediaeval Latin phil- osophy. Moreover, the angels to Maimonides are per- manently existing beings.'96 Indeed he refers to the midrashic statement with regard to the existence of ephemeral angels and like Hallevi he concludes that some angels are permanent and some are transient.I97 But Maimonides' transient angels are unlike those of Hallevi's.

They refer only to those physical and animal powers by which individuals are guided and guarded in their ordinary processes of life.'98 Maimonides agrees, however, with Hallevi in the use of the terms Glory of God, Light of God and Shekinah. All these terms designate some physical phenomenon which manifests itself at the time of the prophetic experience. Such a phenomenon is described by him as being created by God out of some "substance" which is less material than the Aristotelian fifth substance out of which the celestial spheres consist but which is not of the same grade of immateriality as God.199 Undoubtedly he would con- sider it also of a lower grade of immateriality than the Intelligences. This is close enough to Hallevi's "subtle spiritual body" or the Neoplatonic "intelligible matter." As an example of such a phenomenon he mentions the term "pillar of cloud,"20? which occurs in Scripture as a manifestation of the Glory or Presence of God and which, as we have seen, is included by Hallevi in his long list of similar phenomena. It is not certain whether Maimonides would agree with Hallevi as to the meaning of all the other terms in that list. With regard to three of those terms, at least, he definitely disagrees with Hallevi. The term "image" in the verse "in the image of God created He him" (Gen. 1.27) is interpreted by him to refer to the specific form or intellect of man,201 and the term 198 Ibid. nlimpa n's,m mnl,yn n,rts'n m nini mn '1s prtnr, nD1 iw no KTD n"3pn 01" '7i ,D:) n'tA-K1 lMpyl ,OD'3p nmolpo DDIN Dv'K8 D Drh D'MZ nr;ill 1,6 DMIODIN M'DKD. 199 Ibid., I, 76 (2): 1 Wn ; -ni Dm oia n 4i x n olX ' Dtwv l'a 1Don Dota i1 oD'vDam D'9a^an DWa NK ,a'r3BUw ^ Ki .Kn lim.1Kn DV)N ]tw IDk' (D5It4) OtW) -D1' ioN ,1tH ni1nX $i; DVN tm w KMNan2 Ip1y 'Dy 1iK na'3WU nD3an Dtyn (nNir) axn Klnn.

In the vision of Ezekiel, he takes the "wheels" (1.16) and the "wheelwork" (10.2) to refer to the four sublunar elements,204 the "four living creatures" (1.5), i. e., the "chariot,"205 to refer to the sphere of the fixed stars, the spheres of the five planets, the sphere of the sun and the sphere of the moon,206 the "firmament" (1.22) to refer to the concavity of the starless sphere,207 and the "throne" (1.26) to refer to the convexity of the starless sphere.0?8 Elsewhere in Scripture, according to him, the term "throne" refers either to the heaven in general209 or to the ninth sphere210 or to God's 202 Ibid., I, 3: ',wt DVn nnDNm Ivn,Di inay t" ''i nzlnlm. 203 Ibid., II, 26: nrim1n nKINDm Il'Wn nr, ',DIT nm1 nIwy r ,n nnnl linnnm IlWin -iinn nnD K Kirn.

Let us now summarize the result of our discussion. The problem of prophecy by the time of Hallevi and Mai- monides was no longer a mere scriptural problem; it was already intricately enmeshed with the old philosophic dis- cussions about divination and dreams and intuitive knowl- edge, and also with what the philosophers themselves called prophecy. Like any other scriptural problem which was collated with a corresponding philosophic problem, the problem of prophecy had a purely philosophic aspect and a purely religious aspect. The purely philosophic aspect concerned the question of the psychological basis of prophecy and of the part to be played in it by the various faculties of the soul. Maimonides dwells much on this aspect of the problem;2I2 Hallevi hardly touches upon it. The religious aspect of it was the question whether proph- ecy is a purely natural process determined exclusively by the laws of necessary causality or whether there is an element of divine will in it. Both Hallevi and Maimonides agree that it is a process dependent upon the will of God. But in conformity with their respective views as to the operation of the divine will in nature, they differ also as to the operation of the divine will in prophecy. To Hallevi, it is a direct act of God's will; to Maimonides, it is an act of God's will through the intermediacy of the Active Intellect. In conformity also with their respective views as "X Ibid., II, 11: -tw ilnonil in-ln i nrm' niD -i1 ^n m, Som n^Ti iODy nt1' 1-1 D3'K. 212 For detailed studies of this aspect of the problem, see Z. Diesen- druck, "Maimonides' Lehre von der Prophetie," Jewish Studies in Memory of Israel Abrahams, 1927, 74-134; Leo Strauss, "Maimunis Lehre von der Prophetie und ihre Quellen," Le Monde Oriental, XXVIII (1934), 99-139.</page><page sequence="32">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW to what constitutes religious perfection in man, they differ also as to the prerequisite qualifications for prophecy. To Hallevi, right action as prescribed by the Law is sufficient; to Maimonides, intellectual perfection is an additional essential condition. As a result of this difference between them with regard to intellectual perfection as a condition of prophecy, they differ also with regard to the nature of the revelation on Mount Sinai. To Hallevi, it was a direct prophetic experience partaken of by the entire people; to Maimonides, the people were merely eyewitnesses of a prophetic experience which directly affected only Moses. They both also believe that prophetic experience is attended by certain phenomena which are created by God, for that particular occasion, out of some "subtle spiritual substance," which is not exactly immaterial but at the same time it is not of such gross a nature as matter, even not as the fine matter out of which the heavens and the stars are made. Hallevi gives a rather long list of such phenomena, all derived from Scripture. One of these phenomena happens to be mentioned by Maimonides and is taken literally by him in the same sense as in Hallevi, while three other phenomena of Hallevi's list are fully dis- cussed by him and are interpreted allegorically. A similar difference is to be discerned to exist between them with regard to the visions seen by Isaiah, Ezekiel and other prophets. To Hallevi, they are visions of certain real objects made of that "subtle spiritual substance" out of which all the phenomena attending prophecy are made, though he is not certain whether these objects were of enduring existence or only of temporary existence. To Maimonides, they are all to be interpreted allegorically. So also do they differ with regard to those bearers of divine communications which in Scripture are called angels. To Hallevi, they all refer to real beings, some of them of 80</page><page sequence="33">HALLEVI AND MAIMONIDES ON PROPHECY-WOLFSON 81 contemporary existence, created out of fire, and others of enduring existence, created out of that "subtle spiritual substance." To Maimonides, sometimes they refer to real beings, and in that case they are the Intelligences, who are immaterial and of enduring existence; but sometimes they do not refer to real beings, and in that case they are merely figurative terms descriptive of the physical and psychical powers through which God operates in the universe.

Poznanski and Guttmann), p. 51: "With regard to all created things that passed into actuality and became existent during the six days of creation, some of them passed into actuality by the word 'said' alone, as in the creations of the first and third days, but others passed into actuality by the words 'said' and 'created,' as in the creations of the fifth day, and still others passed into actuality and became existent by the words 'said' and 'made,' as in the creations of the second and fourth days and in the case of the cattle and beasts among the creations of the sixth day." a'i=:n iW -lsIN mnN VryD7 O'K1' DUnn v' nKn w ) nwwn olnnl nwt^yD -7 btxr-n ,T'Ot4 -inN nryn -'l D,' 1', mnn '1 .,-rJtn D'l^. 11Wrhcn rl'n ni-n 1: ) ,"l:l nvvtK inK crnm mWo 'N' D'mv -UO w' .wnnn amn n-in ;a3 riwnz 'tU'in 01' nl'-iD nlnri nl n mi ' '-i-n ornm D1'n ori' nl-' 11p 'yl.
