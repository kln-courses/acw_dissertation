<plain_text><page sequence="1">Technology and Violence: Casal, Darfo, Lugones Gwen Kirkpatrick The modernista poets, in their search for spiritual universality and transcendence of everyday reality, collide with a changing histor- ical consciousness as well as with an increasingly urban and techno- logical world. In modernismo one can see the increasing cult of the object, especially in its fascination with the machine and in the rei- fication and fragmentation of the human body, most notably the female body. In their statements about their craft we see poets as- serting, often forcefully, the importance of intricate formal pat- terning, such as elaborate and fanciful rhyme, the revival of ar- chaic rhythmic patterns, and the elaboration of complex allegories. At the same time that the modernista poets make claims for the transformative power of their art, they often deflate within the poetry itself any such transcendent claims to the power of their poetry. Modernismo shows its own self-questioning in the way poets push to the forefront their own ambivalence about the produc- tions they are elaborating. Modernismo's high energy of transfor- mation and its voracity of consumption often smooth away the jagged edges and violent turns of its many contradictions. How- ever, an attentive study of its mechanisms reveals the legacy of ex- plosive energy contained in its powerful harmonies. The late nineteenth-century marks the appearance of the city- scape as a central topic in Spanish American poetry. From Jose Marti's "Amor de ciudad grande" to Lugones' Lunario sentimental to Dario's haunting nocturnes of urban loneliness and despair, the urban landscape brings forth the visual spectacles and accelerated</page><page sequence="2">348 GWEN KIRKPATRICK rhythms of the mass populace and its new machines. The spatial perspectives of poetry's formal landscapes also undergo realign- ments that parallel breaks in social structures and economic ex- change systems. While we usually associate the clashing sounds and arrhythmic beat of the modern city scene with later van- guardist poets (notably Oliverio Girondo), earlier poets give us the fragments of the map of what was once a recognizable, chartable space, a habitus that respected the hierarchies of social structure.1 Although later poems such as Pablo Neruda's "Walking Around" and Cesar Vallejo's "Los nueve monstruos" build much more ob- viously on the rapidly shifting perspectives of the modern city in- habitant, we find earlier examples embedded in modernista poetics. This poetic system, ostensibly glorifying the harmonic mixture of sound, sense, and mystical transport, already includes linguistic and thematic dissonance that forecasts the more staccato rhythms and harsher images of vanguardismo. The traditional anthropomorphic landscape as reflective vehicle for human passions changes with the advent of new machines and new technologies. Now the threatening machine performs the same function that the monster once played in Romantic fiction and poetry, where the presence of the monster assures the emer- gence of difference, just as the fossil preserves continuity.2 Such an emergence of difference makes a tear in the fabric of poetry, and this torn fabric is still being rewoven by later poets. Marked by the presence of violence and reification, such poetry disturbs the mapped-out reasoning of order and beauty previously associated with anthropomorphic landscapes or the idealized plan of the Re- naissance city.3 Modernista poetry incorporated some of the shock waves which reverberated throughout Latin America. New immi- ' Pierre Bourdieu in Outline of a Theory of Practice, trans. Richard Nice (Cam- bridge: Cambridge University Press, 1977), discusses the construction of social hab- itats as reflective metaphors of reigning ideologies: "The construction of a world of objects is clearly not the sovereign operation of consciousness which the neo-Kantian tradition conceives of; the mental struc- tures which construct the world of objects are constructed in the practice of a world of objects according to the same structures.... The mind is a metaphor of the world of objects which is itself but an endless circle of mutually reflective metaphors" (9). 2 Michel Foucault, The Order of Things (New York: Random House, 1973), 155-57. 3 In Barroco (Buenos Aires: Editorial Sudamericana, 1974), Severo Sarduy dis- cusses the Renaissance conception of the universe and the city and analyzes its metaphoricity:</page><page sequence="3">MLN 349 gration waves, greater industrialization, and labor-oriented social movements changed the outlines of Spanish American cities at the turn of the century.4 Just as workers' movements disrupted what was once established political privilege, so frantic rhythms wrenched even modernista poets from pastoral contemplation and reveries of palatial interiors. As the poet is thrust into market place, e.g., the financial compensation offered by the newspapers and the adoption of new "marketing" techniques such as the pop- ular serial magazine and the illustrated book, so poetry follows the crowds into the surging streets. Modernista poetry shows its cre- ators' preoccupations with life in the urban setting, even though such scenes might create jolting contrasts with the stilled scenes of more confined and luxurious interior spaces. New technologies can be understood as formations of the social interactions that constitute them. In the same way, poetic tech- niques serve to reflect and reinforce structures that are seemingly exterior to them, such as social and political organizations or new information systems. In a historical period of dramatic change like fin de siglo Spanish American cities, we can see the clash and re- sulting violence not only in specific social movements but in the coded exchange of information.5 More simply put, poetry does not reflect an idealized, eternal world, for its forms (metrics, rhyme, imagistic coding) are analogous to the environments and ideolo- gies that shape them. In the works of the modernistas one can see the sometimes violent breaks with a former world order. The city in the early part of the century is no longer the planned monument, radiating from the center of ecclesiastical and govern- mental power. New lines of power-railroads, the telegraph, even the seeing eye of the wandering journalist-interact and cancel out the ordered symmetry of a Renaissance dream of harmony "La ciudad, que instaura lo cifrable y repetitivo, que metaforiza en la frase ur- bana la infinitud articulable en unidades, instaura tambien la ruptura sorpresiva y como escenica de esa continuidad, insiste en lo ins6lito, valoriza lo efimero, amenaza la perennidad de todo orden" (61-62) 4 For a summary of specific changes in Latin America, see Tulio Halperin Donghi, Historia contemnpordnea de Latinoamerica (Madrid: Alianza, 1970), 280-82. 5 Two studies are notable for their discussions of modernismo's parallel systems of production, pointing to a need for a reassessment of the movement in terms of its relation to historical circumstances: Noe Jitrik, Las contradicciones del modernismo (Mexico: El Colegio de Mexico, 1978), and Angel Rama, Ruben Dario y el modernismo (Caracas: Ediciones de la Universidad Central de Venezuela, 1970).</page><page sequence="4">350 GWEN KIRKPATRICK and balance. Of many possible responses to such realignments, two literary responses stand out. The first is the flight to the inner sanctum, the "reino interior" of Rodo, where the master still holds his pupils rapt before the wisdom of authority, or to the bejeweled and mysterious interiors of decorative opulence, as in the poetry of Julian del Casal. Another response is to enter the street and to confront the anonymity of a streetcar ride, to allow the landscape vision to include any passerby, no matter how incongruent such a presence might be. The shocks of such contracts are registered in a growing randomness of poetic structure as well as in thematic changes, as one can see quite explicitly in Jose Marti's Versos libres.6 The demonic power of the machine, embodied often as the monster, is yet another example of the shock effect of new tech- nologies on the poetic system. In an almost onomatopoeic pattern, late modernista verse picks up the quickening rhythm of the ma- chine-filled cities, with controls such as strict rhyme and meter losing ground. Machine power certainly is one of modernismo's many topics, although references to it are often shrouded in an- other kind of language.7 However, the fascination with a new tech- nological order took many stances, often ambivalent ones. Given concrete historical circumstances, it must be said that these refer- ences to a new technology must have been part and parcel of a veneration for all things foreign, since many Spanish American cities felt very late the advent of the industrial age in massive ways. However, in certain places the changes were indeed notable. New modes of transportation allowed products to move at an acceler- ated pace. And what Spanish America received were finished goods, often luxury items produced from the raw materials they were shipping north and to Europe. The urban environment, interior architectural space, and the physical body are three habitats that show the violent breaks of change. While sexual violence is a much more overt presence in 6 Roberto Gonzalez Echevarrfa in "Marti y su 'Amor de ciudad grande': notas hacia la poetica de Versos libres," Isla a su vuelo fugitiva (Madrid: Jose Porrila Turanzas, 1983), 27-42, gives a striking portrayal of Marti's "Amor de ciudad grande" as the definitive "modern" voice that first registers the shock of the modern city in Spanish American poetry. 7 The impact of growing technologies on North American literature in particular is examined by Leo March in The Machine in the Garden (New York: Oxford Univer- sity Press, 1976). For a discussion of the same topic in Spanish literature, see Juan Cano Ballesta, Literatura y tecnologia.

Here the figural use of conventionalized scenes turns these cultural cliches or stereotypes (Eve, Salome, the Mallorca of legend, Paris as the shining capital) back on themselves. We begin to see familiar unities of perception projected onto new spaces, thus reorienting their pattern of signification. An ostensibly arbitrary, chance rear- rangement of these cliches questions their stability, just as the sta- bility of genre itself is shaken. In "El sentido poetico de la ciudad moderna"8 Luis Emilio Soto points out that the Spanish American modernistas particularly fa- vored the work of the Belgian poet Emile Verhaeren, whose work broke with the implicit precept that the urban scene could not constitute the raw material of poetry. According to Soto, Ver- haeren is singular among the poets of his generation for his inclu- sion of urban life. As we can easily see in the case of Lugones, the impact of Jules Laforgue's bitter vision of the new city was also a powerful changing force. Soto sums up the more enclosed, con- trasting notion of poetics that so heavily influenced works of the modernista poets with its focus on interior, not exterior, circum- stances: Laboriosas y pacientes rebuscas en pos de nuevas formas constituian a la sazon el desvelo undnime. Depurar los medios excesivos hasta lo in- decible: he ahi el desideratum. El afanoso perfeccionamiento de la tecnica para captar hasta el ultimo matiz de las mas complejas sensaciones era la inquietud 'fin de si&amp;le'. (13) The work of Julian del Casal illustrates the power of the city's dangerous attractions, yet his work offers even more evidence of the need to flee to the interior space, away from the surging city crowds. Casal's fascination with exotic materials and richly deco- rated interiors is also a striking example of the impact of the re- ception of produced goods. His preference is for exotic, often Ori- ental, goods and imported art works, available only to collectors.9 8Proa, Afio I, no. 1 (1924): 11-20. 9 In Charles Baudelaire: A Lyric Poet in the Era of High Capitalism (London: NLB, 1973), 166, Walter Benjamin studies the relationship between fashion and fe- tichism, where "the cult of the commodity recruits this [fetichism] to its service."</page><page sequence="6">352 GWEN KIRKPATRICK The city itself is rarely mentioned in Casal's poetry, although he is known for the famous verse "Tengo el impuro amor de las ciu- dades." Yet, as will be seen, the outward focus enters his poetry in sometimes disturbing ways. Casal's work shields the reader from what a contemporary critic has called "a new primal scene: a space where they [the poor] could be private in public." The new urban scene with its upward swing brings forth its underside: "The set- ting that makes all urban humanity a great extended 'family of eyes' also brings forth the discarded stepchildren of the family."'0 In Casal's "Nostalgias" the desire for wandering is decidedly cos- mopolitan, yet Casal's preference for the city, Parnassian sculp- tural patterns, and Decadent pictorial iconography are statically arranged. Urban life generally enters only on the terms of sugges- tive decor, as well as with a fixation with the modern symptom, ennui. Casal's "En el campo" contains the memorable verse, "Tengo el impuro amor de las ciudades," which is followed by verses less often quoted: "Mas que el raudal que baja de la cumbre / quiero oir a la humana muchedumbre / gimiendo en su perpetua servi- dumbre.""1 In most other poems the image of the hurrying popu- lace, the motley family of man, scarcely appears and is only sug- gested by the laments for former harmonies. The scorn for the mundane makes the presence of the modern masses move like an invasion through this stilled world. The city wanderer whom Casal favors is the dethroned king who passes proudly through the crowd, "tus suefios de oro entre la plebe inmunda; ... pasas altivo entre la turba humana, / mostrando inmaculada tu quimera, / como pasa una estrella por la sombra" ("Obstinacion," 204). The split between idealized beauty and the sordid commonplace is for Casal usually a rigid dichotomy, although as Carlos Blanco- Aguinaga points out, the "pallida pecadora" of "Neurosis" is the ultimate fetichization of the woman-object, bought and sold like the luxury goods that surround her.'2 Casal prefers the intricately wrought acquisitions of high art and 10 Marshall Berman, All That is Solid Melts into Air.

"Mi museo ideal," eleven poems based on a series of paintings by Gustave Moreau, offers a classic example of the museum refuge, the totally stilled space filled up with luxu- rious goods, and the poems reproduce faithfully the paintings' contents in linguistic form. Here Casal invites the reader/spectator to become a conspirator in the game of looking. In this ideal mu- seum, the excess of cultural bric-a-brac and stereotypical images is striking. Here objects and images represent what Eugenio Donato, in his study of the museum-library, has called "displayed history as an eternally present spectacle with transparent origins and anthro- pocentric ends," whose fiction results from the "uncritical belief in the notion that ordering and classifying, that is to say, the spatial juxtaposition of fragments, can produce a representational under- standing of the world."'13 However, when the fiction of rational representation disappears, the heap of fragments cannot substi- tute either metaphorically or metonymically for their representa- tion. One may think with a certain pathos of Casal's ambitious at- tempt to reproduce such a museum in Cuba. In "Mi museo ideal" Casal introduces an almost conspiratorial note that draws into question the poems' "ideal" aspects. His paintings of the scenes, whose content is drawn from legend and mythology, offers an ele- ment that is not available to the viewer of the Moreau canvases. In eight of the poem-paintings, Casal catches the eye of the paintings' subjects in the last tercet, while three are sealed off with an upraised hand, extending the viewer's gaze in an outward swing, flinging out the victory. However, this swing is an indifferent one, and leads the eye outside the painting to another vantage point, perhaps a distanced critical stance. Just as in "Neurosis," where the "billetes en el cofre" break the spell of the white enclosure and remind us of the market place, so here we find the poetic eye straying away from Moreau's fixed scenes. Though Casal can hardly be called a rebel in his treatment of modernismo's fixed scenes, his emphasis on the literal aspects of his models' features questions their value as representation of idealized values. Technology is more an underlying force than an overt topic in Dario's poetry. The trotamundos, the vagabond, and the cosmopol- 13 Eugenio Donato, "The Museum's Furnace," Textual Strategies.

Dario's "Epistola a la sefiora de Lugones" makes clear the collision in space and time of a daily voyage too tangible to be ignored. In the "Epistola" Dario celebrates and at the same time laments his rapid vagabond passage through the capitals of the world. In his actual voyagings, with his "daily labor to survive," Dario shows the dream of the journey as it once might have been. Dario in the "Epistola" gives an undercurrent of nos- talgia and mockery as he shifts back and forth between poetic and geographic registers. It forecasts, by the series of cities listed, Ni- colas Guillen's recorrido through many lands in Paloma de vuelo pop- ular (1958). Guillen touches on many of the same themes in his collection, first with the vision of the popular tourist myths and then the painful and violent underside of reality, as in "Cancion Carioca": ?Te hablaron ya de Rio del Pan, del Corcovado y el sanguinario estio? ?Te han hablado? [. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ............ Yo te hablo de otro Rio: del Rio de Janeiro de no-techo, si frio, hambre-si, no-cruzeiro. ?Te hablaron ya de Rio con su pufnal clavado en el pecho sombrio? ?Te han hablado?14 While Dario is never so explicit as Guillen, he constantly shuffles before our eyes the visions of two different cities, the city of cul- tural legend and the city of daily life, with its sport, neurastenia, need for money, and the obligation for daily work. ?Y mi trabajo diario y preciso y fatal? ?No se sabe que soy c6nsul como Stendhal? Es preciso que el medico eso recete de tambien libro de cheques para el Credit Lyonnais; y envie un autom6vil devorador del viento, 14 Nicolds Guilln, Paloma de vuelo popular (Buenos Aires: Losada, 1973), 61-62.</page><page sequence="9">MLN 355 el cual se pasee mi egregio aburrimiento, harto de profilaxis, de ciencia y de verdad.'5 Here the Paris of legend is for Dario "el enemigo terrible," where he sustains himself "confiando solo en mi y resguardando el yo" (93). The urban populace for Dario, as for Casal, does not evoke the vision of the great fraternity of man: "Las gentes sin higiene ni urbanidad, de feos / trajes, avaros, torpes, o malignos y rudos, / mantienen, lo confieso, mis entusiasmos mudos" (749). The trouble here for Dario, as for Casal and for Lugones, is that "mi maldita vision / sentimental el mundo me aprieta el corazon, / y asi cualquier tunante me explotaral a su gusto / ... Es justo" (748-49). On the island of Mallorca Dario continues stringing together cities in a necklace of experience, joy, and pain. Here the teeming markets are alive, filled with the same vision that must have spoken to Pablo Neruda in "Explico algunas cosas," with his idyllic picture of the Madrid market scene before the diaster of the Spanish Civil War. These market scenes Dario paints, like Neruda's paradisiacal and palpitating world of Madrid's prewar days, represent for Dario the soul's rest which is violated by the daily effort to earn a living amidst the shocks and coldness of the modern capital, Paris. Mallorca's cornucopia represents a world now fading away, one as yet unmarked by mercenary commer- cialism. At this point in his career, we know that Dario has been brought close to the reality of social and political changes; he cannot at this time enter Mexico as governmental emissary, for U.S. troops have already landed in Nicaragua and the president he was to represent has been removed from office.'6 Nor can he follow doctor's orders and retreat to the countryside to rest: "soy consul", he states, and must submit his quota of newspaper articles. Yet Dario ends on an ironic note: "Esta es mucha poesia, sefiora.! Ahora hay comerciantes muy modernos. Ahora / mandan barcos prosaicos la dorada Valencia, / Marsella, Barcelona y Genova. La ciencia / comercial es hoy fuerte y lo acapara todo" (753). El canto errante is indeed a roaming, sometimes Chaplinesque journey. In its title poem Dario also sets side by side his cosmo- politan dream with the cosmopolitan reality he must live on a daily basis. Dario's poems under discussion exemplify the dual role of vagabond, but not as a free spirit. The haunting sounds and images of "Nocturno" show the ravages of a mind set on edge by 15 Ruben Dario, Poesias completas (Madrid: Aguilar, 1968), 748. 16 Octavio Paz, Cuadrivio (Mexico: Joaquin Mortiz, 1969), 43n.</page><page sequence="10">356 GWEN KIRKPATRICK traffic and alcohol and loneliness. The same cosmopolitan spirit of adventure that would lead Dario toward regions of azure and the Mediterranean coast, or a fading vision of a vanishing Central American youth, or a Rio de Janeiro as yet unmarked by his own entrance into political deep water, finds itself magnetized toward the world centers where the cameo visions of decorated goddesses and palatial interiors meet their grostesque counterparts. For here the poverty of the alien writer, sending back cultural messages from the capital, is not always cast in melodic strains of richness and harmony. In Lunario sentimental (1909) Leopoldo Lugones explodes the fa- vored iconography of modernismo's treasures. The Lunario's hard- ened edges, its ironies, and its jolting juxtapositions not only pre- figure vanguardist techniques and themes but also make the reader reflect on poetry's previous presentations. Its images of the city, the machine, the inclusion of the middle class, its vision of the dehumanization of human activities, mark a turning point in the diction and topics of Spanish American poetry. "Los fuegos artificiales," more than any other poem, best repre- sents the explosive destruction of Lugones' previous iconography. The swarming mass of humanity with its "alma de tribu que adora un fuego augusto" is rapt before the fireworks at a patriotic fes- tival. The spectacle's "bazares de cosmos" and its "astronomica feria" constitute a technical caricature of past creations that will foreshadow a future model: Y !con qu6 formidable caricatura, Tu policroma incandescencia Destaca a la concurrencia En un poema de humanidad futura!'7 Formed from a mixture of "un poco de mixto, de noche y de mal gusto," the spectacle is a fitting work of art for its audience, who are described in animalistic terms. The plaza that contains them, "hormiguea / De multitud, como un cubo de ranas." Free from any reminiscence of traditional poetry, "Los fuegos artificiales" accen- tuates the speed, movement, and color of a changed technique. Its title is a metaphor of itself. It celebrates a new technique that does not reproduce the dimensions and perspectives of nature. Yet there is ambivalence in the presentation of this celebration. The crowd reflects the other face of technical prowess. The appeals of 17 Leopoldo Lugones, Obras poeticas completas (Madrid: Aguilar, 1959), 260.</page><page sequence="11">MLN 357 instinct and elementary violence are reflected in the passivity of the crowd before the cannons, bombs, and bright lights of the ar- tificial explosions. Its "millionario tesoro de colores" awakens "arrobos / De paganismo atavico, en cursivas alertas, / Es la pura majestad de los globos / Sobre la 0 vocativa de las bocas abiertas" (256). Its dizzying spin "hace babear los extasis del tonto; / Tro- cando absurdamente su destino / En el sautor regular de un mo- lino" (258). Technology, praised in Las montahas as a force equivalent to na- ture's own (the locomotive hailed as "el gran caballo negro"), must here contend with its results. The bourgeois family, grotesque in its presentation, is transfigured beneath the artificial lights. The exaggeration of physical traits once applied to erotic subjects here creates a picture of macabre juxtaposition. A su lado el esposo, con dicha completa, Se asa en tornasol, como una chuleta; Y el bebe que fingia sietemesino chiche, No es ya mas que un macabro fetiche. La nodriza, una flaca escocesa, Va, enteramente isosceles, junto a la suegra obesa, Que afronta su papel de salamandra Con una gruesa Inflacion de escafandra. Mientras en vaiven de zurda balandra Goza sus fuegos la familia burguesa. (260) The narrative point of view also changes. Not just a spectator of the crowd, the narrator himself is caught up in its movement, changing the relationship of distanced observer: "Donde mi propia persona En coloreado maleficio, / Adquiere algo de sota y de saltimbanqui / Yanqui . . ." (261). Like the spectacle's audience, the observer himself becomes grotesque. While most of the modernistas did not assign to themselves the role of adversary critics of society, their works incorporate the jolting dissonance of the breakdowns between public and private space. Forcefully removed by personal circumstance from the towering, exalted position of the poet-seer, their gaze moves to record at least snatches of an unsettling reality. While each of these three poets lays claim to an aristocratic ideal for the artist, each one lets down the guard gate to the ivory tower to catch a street-level glimpse of the new cities.
