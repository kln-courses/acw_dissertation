<plain_text><page sequence="1">ABSTRACTION AND REPRESENTATION IN MODERN ARCHITECTURE: THE INTERNATIONAL STYLE OF FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT Neil Levine One of the most serious and lasting effects of the International Style exhibition and book of 1932 was the antithesis it estab? lished between the aims of modernism and the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright.1 Wright's 'pioneering' work was shown as preparing the way for the fully developed modernism of Mies, Gropius, Oud, and Le Corbusier (Fig. 1), but was excluded from the accompanying book in which Henry-Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson codified the formal principles of modern architecture in terms of the European examples of what they called the International Style.2 In response, Wright launched his campaign against European modernism, ridiculing the 'aesthetic formula' of the International Style as the 'miscarriage of a machine age', arrived at 'by way of machine worship' and attempting 'to strip hide and horns from the living breathing organism that is modern architecture'.3 And Philip Johnson, more than thirty years later, would call Wright 'the greatest architect of the nineteenth century' and maintain that, although 'he founded modern architecture', he 'is not part of it'.4 Despite the recent critique of the formalism underlying the concept of the International Style and the various redefinitions of the modern movement offered since, nothing has fundamentally altered the attitude towards Wright nor the premises on which it is based. At the heart of the matter is the equation of modernism and abstraction, adopted by Hitchcock and Johnson and accepted by nearly everyone as a way of explaining the development of an architecture no longer based on historical imitation. Hitchcock and Johnson saw the Inter? national Style, with its 'more or less a&gt;nscdpju$Jir? interests in abstract form', as the first 'post-eclectic style',5 and Wright, by contrast and 'in spite of his denials', as still 'unquestionably eclectic in style'.6 The pure, unadorned, geometric shapes of engineering and machinery seemed the proper response on the part of architects to the demands of the Industrial Revolution. The functional basis of archi? tecture provided the moral impetus- to reject any form that was not shaped strictly according to need and in relation to modern materials and methods of construction. In this fervour to wipe out any other references to nature or history, it is not surprising that Wright was considered eclectic and was discounted for much the same reason as the traditionalists. The history of modern architecture is therefore unique among the arts in its purism and exclusionism. In painting and sculpture, where the line between abstraction and representation has always been clear, it has rarely been circumscriptive. Modernist painting includes Picasso and Mondrian, Matisse and Pollock. Its history, beginning in the nineteenth century with Delacroix, Courbet, and Manet, has provided a broad basis for developments in many different directions at once. In architecture, on the other hand, where the distinction between abstraction and representation is terribly muddied and rarely articulated, there have been, as Philip Johnson noted in 1932, 'two histories of architecture', with the operative one for modern architecture being 'concerned with the developments in pure engin? eering'.7 That schizophrenia has helped to throw the very idea of modernism into disarray. Now, with the current revival of interest in the symbolic language of architecture, a reconsideration of Wright's role in maintaining a representational basis for form in twentieth century terms may enable us to expand the notion of modernism and give it greater meaning and relevance, as well as historical accuracy. During the 1920s, as the history of modern architecture began to be written, it seemed obvious that what would distinguish modern architecture from the undisciplined eclecticism of the preceding period of Romanticism was the abstraction resulting frerm a total rejection of traditional forms, meaning the decoration, symbolic imagery, heavy masonry, and symmetry associated with the historical styles.8 According to Theo Van Doesburg, the leading spokesman for the De Stijl movement, 'Architecture had to free its characteristic elements from the art jungle of the past, and in so doing become "abstract".'9 In contrast to the imitative architecture of the nineteenth century, modern architecture would respond directly to the needs of the new machine age, without recourse to representation of any sort. To achieve that purity of expression, as Hitchcock explained in his book Modern Architecture, published in 1929, AA FILES 11 3</page><page sequence="2">architects looked to the model of recent non-representational paint? ing, for the 'abstract painting which began to appear from about 1910 . . . suggested strongly the architectural values in the elemental vol? umes and planes of machinery and engineering'.10 If the Pure Plastic Art of Mondrian, Van Doesburg, and the other members of De Stijl was immediately recognized as having been instrumental in redirecting post-war European architecture away from any lingering romantic historicism and expressionism towards a purified style based on the aesthetics of abstraction, the prior influ? ence of Frank Lloyd Wright was considered perhaps even more fundamental. In 1918, in the first volume of the journal De Stijl, Oud acknowledged the radical nature of Wright's creation of 'a new "plastic" architecture' using the 'primary means' of the 'movement of planes' to open up 'entirely new aesthetic possibilities for architec? ture'.11 Younger Europeans became aware of Wright's architecture through the publications of Ernst Wasmuth in 1910 and 1911 and the contemporary exhibition of his work in Berlin. Mies, who was working for Behrens at the time, later recalled that 'the encounter was destined to prove of great significance to the development of architec? ture in Europe' as 'the dynamic impulse emanating from [Wright's] work invigorated a whole generation'.12 By 1931, however, when Hitchcock and Johnson were organizing the exhibition intended to illustrate the existence of 'a modern style as original, as consistent, as logical, and as widely distributed as any in the past', things had changed.13 The 'golden age' of Wright's Prairie Style had come to a close with his trip to Europe in 1909-10, and the following two decades were the most fallow of his career. Wright spent a good part of that time isolated and out of touch, in Japan, Wisconsin, Southern California, and the Arizona desert. During the eight years immediately preceding the exhibition, he built almost nothing ? only a summer house for a former client, a house for his own cousin, and a temporary camp for himself in the desert. To most observers, his projects and buildings between 1911 and 1932 seemed regressive rather than progressive, from the point of view of the machine aesthetic, that is. Instead of eliminating the vestiges of tradition in his earlier work, such as the pitched roofs, the massive masonry, the symmetrical planning, and, especially, the applied decoration, Wright often appeared to exaggerate their figurative and representational character. In the Imperial Hotel, built in Tokyo between 1916 and 1922, he emphasized as never before the traditional materials covering the reinforced concrete construction to create a powerful, battered profile echoing the shape of Fujiyama itself. Luxuriantly overlaid with handcarved decoration and set out on a rigid Beaux-Arts plan, the hotel, which Wright felt was his most sig? nificant building of the period, seemed to Hitchcock in 1929 'incom? parably worse than ... any coeval Ritz'.14 Hollyhock House (Fig. 19), built for Aline Barnsdall in Los Angeles at the same time, not only retained the classical plan and the blatant decoration Hitchcock des? cribed as 'of unparalleled ^appropriateness', but, in response to the environment of the Southwest, its terraced composition created a 'pyramidal gloom' recalling the pueblo architecture of America as well as Mayan temples of Pre-Columbian Mexico.15 On the other hand, the reinforced concrete-block house Wright built for Alice Millard in Pasadena, California, in 1922-3 seemed to indicate a renewed consciousness of the modern machine aesthetic, with its rationalized construction, flat roof, and cubic volumes. How? ever, it was followed by some of Wright's most idiosyncratic and intensely figurative projects, including the Indian tepees of the Lake Tahoe Summer Colony (1922-3) and Nakoma Country Club (1924) (Fig. 2), the Tower of Babel for the Gordon Strong Automobile Objec? tive and Planetarium (1924-5), and the gigantic crystalline mountain for the Steel Cathedral for a Million People (1926). Where the develop? ing International Style was espousing the universality, discipline, and anonymity of abstract engineering forms, Wright was emphasizing the special imagistic content of each programme and site: while his interest in regionalism and the vernacular led him to adopt a variety of different methods of construction, from the textile-block of California to the canvas and board-and-batten for his own desert camp in Arizona (1929), named Ocatillo and painted red in imitation of the local cactus. By 1932, then, Hitchcock and Johnson had to acknowledge 'a def? inite breach between Wright and the younger architects who created the contemporary style after the War'.16 Whatever common purpose had existed between them before was now irretrievably gone. 'Wright belongs to the international style', they noted, 'no more than Behrens or Perret or Van de Velde.'17 But, despite its purported eclecticism, Wright's work, unlike theirs, was unmistakably modern in its free? dom from historical precedent and in its treatment of architectural space 'in terms of planes existing freely in three dimensions rather than in terms of enclosed blocks'.18 Like Picasso's fracturing of tra? ditional perspectival space in Cubist painting, Wright 'dynamited' the 'solid massiveness of traditional architecture'.19 Wright alone, there? fore, of all those 'half-modern' architects Hitchcock had previously grouped together as the New Tradition, was included in the 1932 1.

But, although he had shown the way towards the new aesthetic of abstraction, he had not fully embraced it. Yet, like Picasso, it was impossible to deny his place in modern art, so that the justification for his inclusion as more than merely a precursor involved a fairly subtle paraphrase of the argument over abstraction in order to explain how 'the exception proves the rule'.20 'In the history of modern architecture', Hitchcock wrote in the catalogue, 'Wright has a place apart. He created . . . most of the aesthetic resources developed by the modern architects of Europe since the War. Yet he is not merely the forerunner of what has now become a new international style.'21 If not merely a forerunner, then what? 'Fundamentally he remains an individualist', Hitchcock re? plied; 'they are classicists and he a romantic.'22 In his preface to the catalogue, Alfred Barr, the Director of the Museum of Modern Art, echoed Hitchcock's sentiments. In explaining more fully why Wright was included in an exhibition designed to show the 'genuinely new style which is rapidly spreading throughout the world', Barr reiter? ated the fact that Wright's role in the exhibition was 'not merely that of "pioneer ancestor"'. Rather, 'as the embodiment of the romantic principle of individualism, his work', noted Barr, should be seen as a foil and 'a challenge to the classical austerity of the style of his best younger contemporaries'.23 The meaning of 'romantic' in this context is crucial if we are to understand the distinction being drawn between Wright and the Inter? national Style. 'Romantic individualism', Hitchcock and Johnson wrote, 'is a dichotomy of the spirit more profound than any mere style can ever resolve.'24 The International Style was supposedly informed by a 'coherent spirit'. As a product of the machine age, it was 'ordered by logic and consistency' and was therefore universal in application.25 Wright's work, especially after 1910, was romantic because it appeared so illogical and inconsistent. Having 'refused even the discipline of his own theories', he could never establish a style or a coherent formal language.26 Wright, the romantic, the individualist, represented the ad hoc; the International Style, the standard. Logic, order, discipline, a common formal language ? this is what made the International Style seem classical and, indeed, analogous to the last 'genuine' architectural style, the late Baroque or Georgian of the eighteenth century.27 The nineteenth century, with its upheavals and revolutions, ushered in the spirit of romanticism, which undermined the classical tradition and gave rise to naturalism and eclecticism. Wright's belief in the 'romantic absolutes of Man and Nature'28 perpetuated an outmoded naturalism, while his ad hoc approach produced just another version of eclecticism. The forms of his build? ings were excessively complex and highly individuated. The variety of images, recalling anything from Indian tepees and Mayan temples to the shapes of surrounding mountains and trees, like the eclectic use of different styles, served the purpose of expressing the particular character of each subject. For the architects of the International Style, however, modern machine methods implied a standardized product ? geometric, abstract, and therefore easily reproduced. The differ? ence between Wright and the International Style was, then, on the face of it, a difference between a figurative and a non-figurative art. Ultimately, that involved the distinction between representation and abstraction.29 Abstraction seemed a natural consequence of the machine age, and the only way to achieve a universal architectural language. The enemy was romantic individualism. The first De Stijl Manifesto of 1918 declared 'world war against the pre-eminence of individualism and idiosyncrasy* and expressed sympathy 'with all who are waging a spiritual or material battle for the creation of international unity'.30 The manifesto of Purism, published by Le Corbusier and Ozenfant in L'Esprit Nouveau in 1920, was in their own words a 'condemnation of "individualistic" art to the benefit of "universal" art', a call to 'purify [the plastic vocabulary] in order to create a transmittable language'.31 And, as Mondrian noted, if the artistic forms 'are to be a direct expres? sion of the universal then they cannot be other than . . . abstract'.32 Once the medium had been purified of any reference to things outside itself, the style, or language, based on abstract formal elements, could be taught and reused anywhere. The logic and order of an abstract architecture of intersecting planes, flat roofs, and monochromatic stucco surfaces, as already evidenced by the Weissenhof Siedlung, built for the International Housing Exhibition in Stuttgart in 1927, seemed a major step beyond the innovations of Wright, just as the radically reductive geometric paintings of Mondrian and Van Doesburg seemed an irreversible development beyond the Cubism of Picasso and Braque. 'The Cubists were mistaken', wrote Le Corbusier and Ozenfant, 'because they did not seek out the invariable constituents of their chosen themes, which could have formed a universal transmittable language.'33 Cubism, in their view, was limited to the expression of the accidental, the momentary, the fragmentary, and the particular. In effect, it was the attachment to representation that ultimately prevented Cubism from establishing a coherent, uniform language. 'Cubism still represents particular things', Mondrian explained, and therefore 'loses unity by 2.

The refusal of the Cubists to give up representation was taken by Mondrian as an admission of the fact that 'they were afraid of their own consequences*.35 To represent something, that is to say, to reproduce or re-create the likeness of an existing aspect of reality, implied a purely romantic or subjective idea of art. Since the appearance of reality depends upon the individual point of view, and changes with every different situation, as a Cubist picture made clear, the process of representation could only produce a purely personal and transitory effect. To transcend the world of subjectivity, wrote Mondrian, one 'must abstract the environment', for 'harmony between nature and the man-made is fantasy ? unreal, impure* ?*&gt; The illusions produced through representation were considered, by those intent on creating a 'new world of space', to fly in the face of modern realities. If the distinction between representation and abstraction in paint? ing or sculpture is fairly clear, it is much less so in architecture. Architecture is usually thought of as an abstract art, like music. It may imitate the principles of nature, as seen in the symmetry of a leaf or the proportions of the human body, but not its forms.37 Architectural forms, such as the arch, the gable, or the column, are in this sense simply conventions. They may have originally derived from nature but, through the process of acculturation, they have become so far removed from their source that they can only be considered abstractions.38 Yet this process of conventionalization is different only in degree, rather than in kind, from what occurs when a painter or sculptor supposedly fashions a likeness of nature. Previous works of art provide his models or schemata in what Gombrich has called the 'making and matching' of art imitating art.39 The concept of the imitation of nature, whether in painting, sculpture, or architec? ture, had always been an idealist construct. With the demise of classical idealism during the last century, it was almost natural, by the second or third decade of this century, to believe that the appearance of an arch, a gable, or a column in a building was the same as a face, a hat, or a tree in a painting. Thus, in the name of abstraction, the flat roof replaced the gable, and thepilotis the column. It was in fact in the mid-eighteenth century, at the beginning of the modern age, that the theory of imitation was explicitly applied to architecture to give it a firm representational basis. Beginning with Vitruvius, architectural treatises had always referred to the primitive hut as the first stage in the development of architecture and had often 3. Frank Lloyd Wright: Susan L. Dana House, Springfield, Illinois, 1901-3. derived certain decorative features such as the Corinthian capital from a specific model in nature, but, in his Essay on Architecture first published in 1753, the French theorist Marc-Antoine Laugier went one step further. He maintained that the primitive hut was the natural model or source for the Greek temple, rather than merely an abor? iginal shelter.40 According to Laugier, the 'noble savage' who built the hut portrayed in the frontispiece of his essay proceeded in his task with exemplary clarity and logic. The tree trunks set up as posts in the four corners supported, on their gnarled tops, four boughs laid hor? izontally like beams and supporting in turn smaller branches set up at an angle to form a gabled roof. The rationality of the solution nat? urally appealed to the Greeks, who reproduced the hut in the perma? nent materials of stone and marble. The post was transformed into the column, the gnarled top into its capital, the horizontal beams became the entablature, and the angled ones the pediment. The Greek temple was therefore a representation of the primitive hut. The natural elements of the hut were 'imitated' and given an 'ideal', permanent form in the Greek orders, so that the Greek temple became the 'ideal nature' of classical representation. Following the same mimetic theory of transformation from prehistorical natural prototype into ideal historical archetype, all other architectural forms, from the arch and the dome to the pyramid and the chimney, could similarly be understood ?s figures in the representational language of architecture. But Laugier's construct remained the essen? tial one, for it explained more than just the natural origin of indi? vidual elements. In his image of the hut, the four trees acting as uprights are still rooted in the ground, and the leaves prefiguring roof tiles are literally growing branches silhouetted, like acroteria, against the sky. Laugier's hut thus affirmed the ultimate aim of represent? ation in architecture, which is the establishment of a continuity be? tween figure and ground, the building being the figure, and its natural setting the ground. This illusion of continuity between building and site would be for architecture what the illusion of three-dimensional objects in space was for the two-dimensional medium of painting. By the end of the eighteenth century, Laugier's theory of represent? ation was elaborated in the teaching of Boullee and then codified in the academic doctrine of Quatremere de Quincy. In the nineteenth century, it was expanded into a full-blown architectural naturalism in the writing of Ruskin. But, more and more, architects and theor? eticians stressed the role of history in the process of reification of nature until, at least in the popular mind, the historical styles of eclec? ticism simply replaced nature as the source of imitation. Eventually, 4. Pablo Picasso: Woman with a Fan, 1909. 6 AA FILES 11</page><page sequence="5">the vernacular followed the academic, and the forms of the clapboard Greek Revival town hall as well as the Shingle Style house came to be charged with an equal degree of representational meaning. Wright's architecture, at the end of the nineteenth century, emerged from a resolution of the tension between the vernacular and the aca? demic without ever compromising the representational basis of each. While his classical project for the Milwaukee Public Library and Museum of 1893 showed the more conventional and academic use of historical precedent, his own house in Oak Park, built a few years before, indicated how he could exaggerate the representational ele? ment of the vernacular gabled roof to concentrate in one simple form the image of shelter. As his work became more and more stylized and personal, as in the Winslow House in River Forest, Illinois (1893), Wright clarified and further simplified the shape of each figurative element, separating one from the other by a change in material or a stark outline (Fig. 16). The horizontal stratification of water table, wall plane, frieze, eaves, roof, and chimney intensified the naturalistic meaning of Laugier's model by calling attention to the intimate relation of building to ground and sky. The horizontal layering of Wright's Prairie Houses after 1900 focused attention as never before on the figure-ground relation as the central issue and prime motive of architectural representation. A strong base, often projected as a continuous parapet, defines the meeting of house and earth, while the overhanging eaves, peaked in the centre and often flaring out at the corners, create a deep shadow line, giving a buoyancy to the roof and making it appear, as Wright wished, to be 'opening flower-like to the sky' (Fig. 3).41 Within that traditional framework of base and roofline, functioning much like the portrait or still-life structure of a Cubist painting, Wright dis? sected and pulled apart the planes, fracturing the image and opening it up to a freedom of movement and a series of ambiguous relationships that were quintessentially modern. Yet, despite the overriding effect of sliding planes and interpenetrating spaces, the elements of architec? tural representation in a house such as the Susan L. Dana house in Springfield, Illinois (1901-3), remain as legible as the coding of fingers, eyes, nose, clothing, or pipe in a contemporary portrait by Picasso (Fig. 4). In the Dana House, the classical pediment of the earlier Milwaukee Library project has been reduced to a series of faceted planes like the hat in Picasso's Woman with a Fan of 1909, giving it an expressive brevity similarly non-Western in inspiration. Piers flank? ing the arched entrance of the facade recall the classical portico, though like the highlights on the cheeks, nose, and eyes of the Picasso face they are flattened and blunted to maintain the plane. And above, like the brim of her hat, there is a frieze of stylized sumac leaves that seem to grow out from under the shadow of the eaves, turning into the bevelled, green, copper-sheathed gable as they reach for the light. Throughout his career, Wright used sculpture, both decorative reliefs and free-standing figures, to help articulate the representational meaning of his buildings.42 Most often, as in the Dana house, and going right back to the Winslow House of ten years before, it was a geometric stylization of a natural motif, used in a band like a classical frieze. At the upper edge of the vertical plane where wall meets sky, the sculptural relief would help soften the transition between figure and ground while recalling the natural model of growth and efflor? escence. Wright's use of figurative sculpture also followed classical traditions. In his Milwaukee Library project, sculptured figures are silhouetted against the sky while others are placed in the central hall, within the intercolumniations of the main portico. Characteristically, the sculpture seen against the sky becomes a figurative extension of the building into its natural environment, while the figures on the interior give a physical presence and concreteness to the space, re? minding us that, no matter how abstract the medium of architectural space may seem, the forms developed over time to contain and articu? late that space all make reference to some model in nature. Throughout history, figurative sculpture has been used by archi? tects to embody and make more specific the representational meaning of architectural images. Here, of course, one immediately thinks of everything from the Valley Temple of Chephren at Giza to the Arc de Triomphe and the Opera in Paris. In public buildings such as the Larkin Building (1903-4), the Imperial Hotel, and the project for the Nakoma Country Club, Wright commissioned or designed sculpture to symbolize the character of the building, while in the Midway Garden (1913-14) he peopled the entire roof terrace with figures pro? jecting into the environment in an architectural ballet complement? ing the music below. For private houses Wright usually chose to incorporate plaster casts of well-known classical subjects, such as the Victory of Samothrace or Michelangelo's David, to define and charac? terize the interior space (Fig. 5). Like the actual bits of reality glued to the surface of a Cubist collage, these ready-made figural presences, set within the gridded web of Wright's spaces, point up the abstract nature of that space and at the same time intensify our sense of its representational basis in illusion, as in the tent-like pavilion of the Coonley House living room, the arbour-like pergola of the Darwin D. Martin House conservatory, the arched canopy of the barrel 5. Frank Lloyd Wright: Darwin D. Martin House, Buffalo, New York, 1904. Pergola leading to conservatory.</page><page sequence="6">vaulted gallery of the Dana House, or the cavernous grotto of its entrance and stair hall. Indeed, the Dana House provided Wright with one of his first major opportunities to use all the arts and crafts at his disposal to cre? ate a completely integrated environment. The 'grammar', as Wright put it, from the overall design down to every significant detail, was based on the sumac.43 No matter how abstracted and geometricized the motif becomes in the stained glass, the painted or moulded friezes, the lampshades, or even the carpet designs, a pattern of nature is felt throughout the house from the moment one enters through the arch under the green flaring eaves into the space of the stair hall, suffused as it is with natural light from above and resonant with the sound of water trickling into a pool opposite the fireplace. For this introduc? tion to the world of illusion, where nature outside would be trans? formed into architecture inside, Wright designed a piece of sculpture embodying his conception of architecture as an art of representation. Called the Flower in the Crannied Wall after a poem by Tennyson, the sculpture was executed and cast in terracotta by Wright's friend Richard Bock.44 Wright placed the pale-coloured female figure directly on axis, so that it would appear through the arch of the entrance, in the dimness of the vestibule, like a nymph chanced upon in a glade (Fig. 6).45 With natural light coming from behind, both from above and below, she slowly emerges as if through a mist. Her thin, vertical figure, like a chink of light, throws the arch into relief, making it seem truly cavernous. The entrance thus becomes the cranny in the wall in which the flower of the figure takes root. The Flower in the Crannied Wall is a young maiden building an abstract, crystalline tower out of interlocking, geometric blocks (Fig. 7). At first the meaning seems obvious: the maiden is the muse of architecture, and the tower, her creation, is a pure abstraction. But the image is more complex. Figure and tower rise together from the same rudimentary base and, like Rodin's contemporary sculpture based on Michelangelo's Slaves, the two forms only gradually emerge from the block. Neither natural form nor abstract pattern takes precedence. Both derive from the same creative impulse. Wright's Flower in the Crannied Wall symbol? izes the idea that the source of architectural form lies in the conven? tionalization of nature through the medium of representation. Although more than a quarter of a century separated the design of the Dana House from the International Style exhibition, it is fair to say that the conception of architecture embodied in the Flower in the Crannied Wall remained fundamentally the same for Wright through out those years. If any single building were chosen to stand for his work following the publication of the Wasmuth portfolio in 1910, it would have to be his own house, Taliesin, at Spring Green, Wisconsin, built in 1911, rebuilt after a fire in 1914, and rebuilt once again after another fire in 1925. It may therefore come as no surprise that Wright used a second cast of the Dana House sculpture to occupy a pivotal spot in the house he built for himself in the hills of southern Wisconsin. Placed outdoors, in the natural setting of his 'ancestral valley', the sculpture took on a richness of meaning unmatched in his other work (Fig. 8). Taliesin, which means 'shining brow' in Welsh, was designed as a series of earth-hugging wings following the contours of the hill Wright said he 'turned to... as a hope and haven' after the break-up of his marriage and his flight to Europe with the wife of a former client in 1909-10.46 The buildings form an open court embracing the hill just below its crown so that, in his words, 'the hill-crown was . . . saved and the buildings became a brow for the hill itself.47 Wright's 'beloved hill' was the focus, and the house was designed to 'belong to that hill, as trees and rock ledges did'.48 The local, rock-faced, yellow limestone of the walls was laid up in strata 'like ledges on the hill' to give the house the appearance of a natural outcropping, like those Wright saw in 'the facades of the hills' surrounding the site (Fig. io).49 Wright placed the figure of the Flower in the Crannied Wall at the symbolic centre of the composition, where it appeared in the frontis? piece for the first publication of Taliesin in Architectural Record in 1913.50 Located on a stone ledge at the base of the hill-crown, along the edge of the courtyard drive, the sculpture marks the juncture of the natural and the man-made ? with 'the hill crown rising unbroken above it to crown the exuberance of life in all these rural riches' and the house built up below and around it to make 'a "shining brow" for the hill'.51 No longer in an interior space, but now actually growing out of the stone wall retaining the hill-crown, along with the other trees and flowering bushes on its slopes, the Flower in the Crannied Wall literally embodies the spirit of the place. Its two aspects find their direct referents in the juxtaposition of building and landscape. And the relation between architecture and nature is condensed in the figure mediating between the conflicting demands of abstraction and representation. In this sense, then, Wright's work once again recalls that of Picasso, for the image of the Flower in the Crannied Wall in the courtyard at Taliesin reveals an understanding of the creative process that is remarkably similar to Picasso's etching of the Painter with a Model 8 AA FILES 11</page><page sequence="7"></page><page sequence="8">^^^*^^ ^^^^^^ ^^^^ ^ jffjjj^ ^^B^^ ^3^^% ^Kifl^^^^^Ha #.

Done in 1927 as an illustration for Balzac's Chef d'oeuvre inconnu (published by Vollard in 1931), the etching depicts the painter at work at his easel at the moment he glances at his model, who is knitting. There seems to be no relation between what he has drawn on the canvas and what he sees before him, for the image on the canvas is an abstract maze of curved and straight lines, while the model is a straightforward representation of a rather corpulent woman. In Balzac's tale, the artist turns the portrait he has been painting into a meaningless jumble of lines and colours as a result of trying to develop and perfect the image he started with, thus losing sight of reality in the hope of discovering some deeper and hidden spiritual meaning. (His quest ends in suicide.) In Picasso's etching, abstraction and represent? ation are clearly contrasted and a contemporary meaning is given to the story, for the work of art appears to be the result of an almost compulsive urge to deny existing reality in the attempt to create an abstract picture. But again, as with Wright, our first explanation seems too simple. Although the image on the canvas and the model in nature obviously do not correspond, the artist is shown carefully checking the one against the other, so that one must understand that abstraction is a means to an end. The final work of art, the etching, is not an abstraction. It represents both the painter and his model held in balance by the abstract painting in the centre, and thus proposes the idea that, while a work of art achieves a certain degree of univer? sality through the process of abstraction, it can communicate that meaning to the world at large only when the language of represen? tation is used to establish a common ground. The hermeticism of abstraction is illustrated by the unfinished painting, where the lines seem to float in a groundless space with no beginning and no end, a space without definition, where the only shadow is the one cast by the painter himself. By contrast, the few diagonal lines that provide the studio setting for the Painter with a Model Knitting establish a ground with just enough semblance to reality to allow the inter? action of figures to become meaningful. At the basis of represen? tation, then, just as we saw in the development of conventions for architecture, lies the articulation of the relation of figure to ground, though in painting its aim is to provide the illusion of three dimensional, habitable space. By the time Wright built Taliesin, he too, like Picasso, had arrived at a directness and conciseness in the imitation of nature that reveals a fully mature understanding of the delicate balance between the pur? poses of abstraction and representation. Taliesin was Wright's most naturalistic design up to then, but it was also his most abstract. According to Wright, Taliesin was to be an abstract combination of stone and wood as they nat? urally met in the aspect of the hills around about [Fig. 10]. The lines of the hills were the lines of the roofs, the slopes of the hills their slopes, the plas? tered surfaces of the light wood-walls, set back into shade beneath broad eaves, were like the flat stretches of sand in the river below and the same in color, for that is where the material that covered them came from. Finished wood outside was the color of gray tree-trunks in violet light. Shingles of the roof surfaces were left to weather silver-gray like the tree branches spreading below them.52 Wright thought Taliesin was 'supremely natural', yet explained that quality as having been achieved through the rigorous discipline of abstraction. Along with Picasso, Wright rejected the idea of abstrac? tion as a product. Wright saw it as a means to achieve a new directness in the representation of natural form rather than an end in itself. To abstract was to conventionalize, a lesson Wright claimed to have learned from the study of Japanese prints. The 'conventionalization of natural things revealing the potential poetry of nature' was under? stood by Wright to mean the 'stringent simplification by elimination of the insignificant, and a consequent emphasis on reality', a 'process whereby its natural character was really intensified and revealed in terms of stone adapted to an architectural use'.53 Taliesin can be called a 'natural house', as Wright called it, or even a mythic, aboriginal shelter, as others have,54 because it seems to return to the very source of architectural representation, bypassing all those conventions that history handed down since Laugier's hut was supposedly imitated in stone. It might 'safely abandon forms . . . held through habit or tradition' because, as Wright later noted, 'it goes to the roots'.55 The process of abstraction in the creation of Taliesin did not there? fore mean a retreat from nature, but rather a more essential con? nection with it. The relation between figure and ground that had previously been transmitted through conventional forms was now direct. 'Stone was sent along the slopes into great walls', wrote Wright, 'Stone stepped up like ledges on the hill and flung long arms in any direction that brought the house to the ground. The ground! My grandfather's ground. It was lovingly felt as intimate in all this.'56 The figure of the house, like 'the modeling of the hills', was designed to appear 'no less a weaving and a fabric than the trees'.57 And, like them, it would change with the seasons, becoming 'an open camp' in the summer and, in the winter, 'a frosted palace roofed and walled with snow, hung with iridescent fringes' of 'icicles'.58 10. Taliesin. View from hill-crown to entrance to living area.</page><page sequence="10">he illusion of continuity between architecture and nature in Wright's work depended on the intimate connection be JL tween figure and ground that grew out of a thoroughly mod? ern conception of the representational basis of architecture. But by the early 1930s the infatuation with machines and technology had pro? duced an aesthetic that found such an attachment to nature irrelevant. In developing his theory of 'artificial sites' for the Radiant City, pub? lished in 1933, Le Corbusier scorned 'the natural ground' as merely 'the dispenser of rheumatisms and tuberculosis', demanding that 'we say "goodbye" to the natural site, for it is the enemy ofman9.59 The automobile and the ocean liner, those symbols, to European architects, of the modern age, were an everyday part of Wright's life. The Imperial Hotel in Tokyo was built as a result of more than a dozen Pacific crossings, and it was the automobile that allowed Wright to live out in the hills of rural Wisconsin. Wright matter-of factly accepted its existence and planned Taliesin around it. For Le Corbusier, by contrast, the ocean liner and the automobile represen? ted so radical a change in man's way of living that he claimed they would usher in an entirely new and abstract form of architecture. The automobile in particular, as a product of modern methods of pre fabrication and standardization, using the most up-to-date materials and technologies, became the model for the efficient dwelling for modern, 'nomadic' man. But, even more, the automobile, as a means of transportation, interposed a mechanism between man and nature that literally sundered the traditional connection between building and ground, calling into existence an abstract architecture for 'artificial sites'. Le Corbusier presented the stark contrast between traditional and modern architecture in a disarmingly simple diagram given the pol? emical title 'The architectural revolution is complete. . . ' (Fig. n).60 On the left side, seen in negative, is the traditional dwelling. Built of load-bearing masonry walls, its foundations are sunk deep in the earth, with each floor above being composed of boxy rooms, no doubt ill lit by narrow vertical windows. The whole is capped by the traditional hip roof, tying the solid little figure of the house to the ground. On the right side, pure and pristine against its white back? ground, is the new architecture, liberated from the past and raised high off the ground to allow the automobile underneath to symbolize the distance architecture had travelled. Using reinforced concrete and standardized methods of industrial fabrication, the house, like the car, takes on an appearance of impermanence. With foundations reduced to a series of piles, just barely puncturing the earth, and the 'tra ditional rooftop [that] usually supported the winter with its layer of snow' levelled off to reconstitute artificially the ground given over to the car, the house becomes an abstraction of vertical and horizontal planes in space.61 In Le Corbusier's words, a 'framework' of pilotis now carries 'horizontal planes which are floors' that are in turn enclosed by the vertical planes of 'light-giving facades'.62 Liberated from the constraints imposed by the use of natural materials and tra? ditional methods of construction, the floor plan is 'free' to take on any configuration desired, just as the facade is also 'free' to become a two-dimensional screen of opaque and transparent effects, with the autonomy of a Neoplastic painting. The contrast between traditional and modern architecture is drawn by Le Corbusier in black-and-white terms. The triumph of abstraction is seen as historically inevitable, and there is no going back to nature. Among all the architects included in the International Style exhi? bition, it was generally agreed by the organizers that Le Corbusier himself had done most to prove this true. He was, according to Hitchcock and Johnson, the one 'who first made the world aware that a new style was being born', and 'his name has become almost syn? onymous with the new architecture'.63 In a spectacular series of pri? vate houses done during the 1920s, Le Corbusier showed the variety of artistic possibilities inherent in the new abstraction. The autonomy of the architectural object might be dramatized by the use of pilotis to turn a house like the Villa Savoie at Poissy (1929-30) into a 'pure prism' of white stucco set atop a grassy knoll; or it might be more subtly demonstrated in what Le Corbusier called the more 'difficult case' of the Villa Stein at Garches (1927-8),64 where the facades are treated as a series of up-ended, independent planes in order to emphasize the frontality of expression normally associated with the abstract con? dition of the flat surface of a painting (Fig. 12). Here, in the entrance facade, the white stucco, the flat roof, and the two continuous rows of horizontal ribbon windows define an orthogonally gridded plane on which the projecting and receding balconies and marquee produce a surface tension similar to the effect of the coloured rectangles in a painting by Mondrian (Fig. 13). The particular power of Le Corbusier's architecture, however, resides partially in the fact that, although the imagery is not purely geometric, it always remains abstract. The forms are relieved by refer? ences to the machine age, such as the ocean liner's ribbon windows and railings used in the balconies, or the wing struts of a biplane sup? porting the marquee. Yet these mechanical figures never work together to reproduce any existing form of machine. Rather, they reinforce the re 1 - j. .r" X'' '^x ? /V* , ( , ? -- ' - 11.

Like the image of an objet-type superimposed on the 'primary* abstract forms of a Purist painting, they provide the 'secondary resonance* Le Corbusier and Ozenfant claimed was necessary to make the universal concrete.65 The abstraction of the International Style, at least in Le Corbusier's work, can thus be likened to the Machine Art of Picabia and Duchamp. The way in which the geometric forms of the Villa Stein, for example, are refigured in machine terms immediately calls to mind such paint? ings by Picabia zsUEnfant Carburateur of 1919 (Fig. 14). Here, against a totally abstract ground, the geometric shapes of a Mondrian are given their mechanical equivalents. But, whereas the title indicates a dual reference, a combination of personage and machine, the actual image, floating in space, is a representation neither of an automobile part nor of a child. According to Picabia, it was supposed to show us 'something that nobody had ever seen before'.66 It is an abstract mechanism, generated, like Le Corbusier's machine a habiter, by analogy rather than representation. The image of Picabia's 'child carburator' is not a representation of something in the real world but an analogy for a being in a totally alien, mechanized world. In its details it recalls certain things we know, but its overall shape is a purely abstract creation, existing in a gravity-free space, on a plane removed from nature, like one of Le Corbusier's 'artificial sites', a paradigm or model for what life might be like elsewhere. In such an abstract mechanomorphic world, the ground becomes totally vestigial. Both Duchamp and Le Corbusier realized this at just about the same time. In his Large Glass (The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even), planned in 1913-14 and left unfinished in 1922, Duchamp eliminated the ground completely by projecting the male Malic Moulds and female Milky Way, acting as the mechanical anal? ogues of his amorous display, onto sheets of transparent glass. There, in that dematerialized realm of pure space, they could remain in sus? pended inanimateness, heralding for the world of Dada and Surrealist art the death of traditional painting. Le Corbusier, in his Maison Dom-ino of 1914, provided a similar kind of model (Fig. 15). Based on purely technological considerations, the structure, consisting of continuous horizontal slabs of reinforced concrete separated by vertical posts set out on a grid, established a completely transparent framework for architecture as 'a pure creation of the mind'. Rooted neither to the earth nor to historical traditions, the series of 'artificial sites' are stacked one on top of the other and appear to be infinitely extendible in every direction. Unlike Laugier's hut, the model is not bounded by tectonic limits nor is it set within 14. Francis Picabia:L'Enfant Carburateur, 1919. the framework of nature: rather, like Duchamp's Large Glass or a Mondrian painting, it is cropped from a boundless expanse of space and seen in a kind of dematerialized void. If Laugier's hut was the reconstruction of an intention confirmed by the experience of his? tory, the Dom-ino model was the projection of an idea onto the plane of a future world where both history and nature would have to give way to conform to its imperatives.67 Of the buildings in the International Style exhibition, surely none more than Mies's Barcelona Pavilion (1929) seemed to fulfil the abstract ideal of dematerialization. The steel, glass, chrome, and polished marble become reflective and transparent planes sliding over, behind, and underneath one another to produce a free-flowing, abstract space. While the source of Mies's composition of interpenetrating planes could be traced back to Wright's Robie House (1908-9) (Fig. 1), the new free? dom of each element from a figurative role was obviously different. But it was perhaps Mies's use of free-standing, figurative sculpture to control and articulate the space in a manner also deriving from Wright that proved more than anything else how far architecture had evolved away from Wright and in the direction of abstraction.68 In the Barcelona Pavilion, Mies placed a standing figure of a female dancer by Georg Kolbe in the pool located at the end of a sequence of vertical and horizontal planes of marble, glass, stucco, and water that define the interior space. The dancer's knees are flexed, her two arms raised and outstretched, as she balances herself on the rock rising out of the plane of water. Her human gestures and plasticity contrast with the slick machined surfaces of the setting, which is, by contrast, drained of all tectonic force. The sculpture, active and pushing against space, rises from its solid base into an extended shaft or torso that finally opens out into a broad ring of arms and head. Like a stripped, somewhat defensive Corinthian maiden, the sculpture becomes a surrogate classical column, an intensely representational figure in a totally abstract ground. It acts as a foil to the architecture. The chrome-encased, cruciform point-supports have neither base nor capital and thus read against the figure like gleaming abstract lines in a space composed of intersecting flat planes elevated into the third dimension from the surface of a De Stijl painting. While the figurative sculpture in Wright's work served to reinforce the representational basis of his architecture through a complex form of Cubist layering, in Mies's work it literally relieved architecture of its representational role. Mies used sculpture to give an autonomy to the abstract architectural object and thereby seemed to have taken the Cubist idea to its logical conclusion. 15.

AA FILES 11 13</page><page sequence="12">The International Style exhibition appeared to confirm the historical progression from Cubism to abstraction. The Bau? haus was still in full swing, the careers of Le Corbusier and Mies were beginning to take off, while Wright's seemed to be over. 'Conditions are changed', warned Hitchcock in the catalogue; 'the day of the lone pioneer is past'. 'Throughout the world there are others beside Wright to lead the way toward the future', he added, noting that 'those who have purified and solidified their interpret? ation of his doctrine, seeking more consonance with the second quarter of the twentieth century and less with the romantic absolutes of Man and Nature, have attained throughout the world a real inte? gration of style'.69 Then, to almost everyone's surprise, Wright returned to the fore? front with a series of spectacular buildings and projects, beginning with Fallingwater (1935-7), Broadacre City (1935), and Johnson Wax (1936-9), and leading up through the Usonian houses (1936 onwards) to Taliesin West (1938-43) and the Guggenheim Museum (planned 1943-4; built 1956-9). At first it seemed obvious that Wright's recovery was due in large part to the lessons he learned from the International Style. Broadacre City was simply his version of the Radiant City, while Fallingwater (Fig. 21) combined the cantilevered elevation of Neutra's Lovell 'Health House' (1927-9) with the open, staggered plan of Mies's Barcelona Pavilion. Yet, no matter how close Wright's architecture came to looking like the International Style, it never lost its represent? ational quality. In fact, the connection with nature was intensified to a degree previously approached only in Taliesin. Broadacre City grew directly out of the existing reality of American suburbia, and it put every citizen in touch with the ground, each receiving a minimum of one acre to live on and to farm. In Fallingwater Wright used the flat roofs, steel-sash ribbon windows, and reinforced concrete planes of Neutra and Mies to create, as he said, an 'extension of the cliff beside a mountain stream'.70 For the construction of his own winter headquarters in the desert outside Phoenix, called Taliesin West (Fig. 23), Wright took as his model 'the great nature-masonry' of Arizona's mesas and canyons.71 He packed the coloured stones of the desert floor into long stretches of 'desert concrete' and then grooved and canted their porous surfaces to give the effect of natural erosion so characteristic of the Arizona land? scape.72 Looking almost more natural than man-made, as if 'sculp? tured by wind and water',73 Taliesin West seemed to Wright to have 'belonged to the Arizona desert as though it had stood there during creation'.74 Even the Guggenheim Museum, on its Fifth Avenue site in New York City, was to be perceived in relation to a natural model. According to Wright, 'it is like the relaxation you get from the unbroken but constantly moving waves of the sea!'75 During this same period, following the International Style exhib? ition and into the 1940s and 1950s, both Mies and Le Corbusier changed a great deal too. Gone were the slick, purist volumes, and instead there was a new plasticity and 'monumentally', to use the term Siegfried Giedion made popular. But, despite the steel frames or symmetrical planning in the case of Mies, or the sculptural, exposed reinforced concrete in the case of Le Corbusier, their work remained fundamentally abstract. Mies's buildings in the United States, like Mondrian's paintings done in New York, made the geometric grid more explicit in rendering it more vivid. The move towards sym? metry and order grew out of the same classical basis in geometric abstraction. Le Corbusier's buildings of the late forties and fifties, such as the Chapel at Ronchamp (1950-54), the Capitol at Chandigarh (begun 1952), the Monastery of La Tourette (1957-60), and the Unite d'Habitation at Marseilles (1946-52), all have a sculptural power and materiality that appears to deny any link with his mechanistic abstrac? tions of the 1920s. But the organic figures of distended pylons, up? turned rooflines, protruberant light monitors, or curving plans no more inform the whole than did the mechanical ones previously. They give an 'ineffable' poetic resonance to the underlying Cartesian grid that recalls Miro's contemporary landscapes and reminds us of Le Corbusier's Surrealist heritage. Biomorphism replaces mechanomorph ism to distinguish the work from straight geometric abstraction and give it the muscle and brutal power of an abstract expressionism.76 By the early 1950s, then, the fundamental difference between Wright and the International Style remained the same, despite all the changes in appearance. But by then it was no longer possible simply to dismiss Wright's attitude to nature as a thing of the past, as it was in 1932, for his work had taken on a renewed sense of vitality and immediacy. In a symposium at the Museum of Modern Art in 1948, Hitchcock declared that 'it is hard, unless we turn to that extraordinary man, Frank Lloyd Wright, to find much wealth or variety or range of expression in modern architecture at the present time', and then proceeded to call Wright 'the Michelangelo of the twentieth century'.77 In making that comparison, however, Hitchcock effect? ively denied Wright's relevance to the contemporary situation, for he was quick to note the 'danger' of following someone like Michel? angelo, who 'was a master who looked forward, not to what was going to happen in ten years, but to what was going to happen in fifty H AA FILES 11</page><page sequence="13">years'.78 Philip Johnson echoed this opinion a few years later when he too compared Wright to Michelangelo ? 'the enigma of architectural history' ? recalling once again that Wright was for modern archi? tecture, as Michelangelo was for the Renaissance, 'the exception that illustrates the rule'.79 The comparison between Wright and Michelangelo was useful for polemical reasons. It got rid of a problem gracefully. But Wright was also often compared at the time to Picasso, and that now seems much more relevant and significant.80 Both artists were seen as the great 'individualists', living and working in isolation, in a world of their own making, helping create around themselves a myth of genius. In the richness, variety, and scope of their work, both seemed to transcend all labels and all movements. Yet each, in his own way, seemed to have outlived his time ? having done his most radical work at the beginning of the century (c.1900-14); then having had a second wind, or renaissance (c.1932-43); and finally having gone on to re? produce himself in ever more simple-minded and vulgar pastiches. But what they shared as modern artists above anything else, and what indeed may explain the similar trajectories of their careers, was a devotion to nature as the model for art and a belief in the power of representation to continue to convey meaning in the twentieth cen? tury. Despite all the differences in their backgrounds, interests, and lifestyles, their work thus presents over a period of seven decades an extraordinary parallel of the history of representation within the development of modernism. And such a coincidence, which can only be briefly sketched here, should certainly lead one to question any definition of modernism that does not include its two foremost figures. Both Picasso and Wright started their careers by attempting to reconcile the idealism of an academic tradition with a more realist, and even materialist, form of representation deriving from the vernacu? lar of the countries in which they grew up. In Picasso's case that meant the earthy realism of Zurbaran and early Velasquez, in Wright's the Shingle Style. In the earnestness and unadorned simplicity of Picasso's paintings of beggars and old men, dating from the mid-i89os, as in the small gabled house Wright built for himself in Oak Park in 1889, there is a directness of expression owing to the adoption and straightforward use of vernacular conventions. Within just a few years of each other, both artists soon transformed that into an extremely refined and stylized form of representation. In Wright's Winslow House in River Forest, Illinois (1893) (Fig. 16), as in Picasso's Courtesan with Jewelled Collar (1901) (Fig. 17), the image is flattened and each part is separately outlined and emphasized. The figures of house and person are thereby condensed into types and made more symbolic than real. In the first years of this century, both Picasso and Wright turned to non-Western, or at least non-traditional, sources, in Picasso's case primitive and African sculpture, in Wright's case Japanese prints. By 1906 or so, both artists had begun to deconstruct the stylized imagery of their earlier work, dissecting it and subjecting each part to analysis (Figs. 3, 4). The result was Analytical Cubism, which reached its cul? mination in their work of about 1908-10. In Wright's Robie House (Fig. 1) as in Picasso's contemporary portraits (Fig. 4), the conven? tional image of house or person is broken down into a series of intersecting, overlapping, and nearly autonomous planes. While the presence of such indices of representation as roof, chimney, balcony, and urn, or forehead, eyes, nose, and beard, allow conventional read? ings to occur, the discontinuity of the parts sets up a tension between the poles of abstraction and representation that is as extreme as any art ever produced. The image, while rooted in the real world, seems to exist in a realm of space all its own, not quite an illusion but not quite a denial of it either. This development of Analytical Cubism seemed to point in the direction of a purely abstract art, but neither Picasso nor Wright was willing to take that path out of what Clement Greenberg called the 'paradox of Cubism'.81 It was right after completing the Robie House that Wright left his practice and family in Oak Park to go to Europe for a year to think. When he returned to build Taliesin in 1911, he arrived at a fully modern solution to the problem of representation that again seems strikingly similar to Picasso's development of Syn? thetic Cubism out of the use of collage during the same years (1911-13). In contrast to the Robie House, for instance, where the brick and stone trim are neutral carriers of representational meaning, in Tali? esin the stone, plaster, and shingles both represent the traditional elements and assert their own material presence as shapes. As in Picasso's Student with a Newspaper (1913), where the stippled and shaded planes, some totally abstract and some trompe Voeil imitations of wall-graining, are synthesized into an image of a person literally on the surface of the canvas itself, in Taliesin the stone laid up in strata, to imitate the surrounding outcrops, forces us to read the building, though utterly abstract in its forms, as a natural extension of the hillside. The delicate balance between abstraction and representation struck in Synthetic Cubism was almost immediately called into question, mwhibiitts^ 16. Frank Lloyd Wright: William H.

AA FILES 11 *5</page><page sequence="14">first by the development of abstract art and then by Surrealism. During the years from about 1915 to 1930, both Picasso and Wright seemed to waver in their commitment to modernism, each pursuing what often appeared to be multiple and self-contradictory styles. At first both turned to classicism, in Picasso's case the academic drawing of Ingres, in Wright's the symmetry of Beaux-Arts planning, as evidenced in his Imperial Hotel. Then, around 1920, in an effort to renew the representational force of their forms, they both looked back to an imagery of sculptural mass and weight, resulting in Picasso's monumental neo-classical bathers on the one hand (Fig. 18) and Wright's neo-Mayan buildings on the other (Fig. 19). Soon, however, a series of more angular and linear works appeared, giving expression to the less tangible, more emotional aspects of the world of reality. By the end of the twenties, both Picasso and Wright developed an expressionistic mode of representation that denied their images almost all sense of solidity and permanence and gave such works as Wright's desert compound of Ocatillo, built in 1929, or Picasso's Self Portrait and Monster of the same year, a vibrancy and sense of the mystery of organic life lying just beneath the surface of things. In the following decade, both Picasso and Wright achieved a new synthesis, meeting the challenge of both abstract art and Surrealism, and endowing the forms of representation with an unforeseen spir? itual depth and psychological complexity. In paintings such as the Girl before a Mirror (1932) (Fig. 20), or buildings such as Fallingwater (1935-7) (Fig. 21), the imperatives of abstract form are no longer seen as independent from those of representation. Shape, colour, and texture present image and reflection, figure and ground, in a continuously overlapping space. In Fallingwater, the horizontal strata of stone in the walls of the glen are repeated in the Taliesin-like stonework of the rear walls of the house, while the shape of the boulders in the stream are echoed in the cantilevered balconies tied back into the cliff behind. The main boulder on which the house rests protrudes through the floor of the living room to become the hearth of the fire? place, while diagonally opposite, in the far corner of the room, a glass hatch leads down through the floor to the water below, allowing the moisture and sound from the waterfall to penetrate the very ground of the house. The house does not merely provide a view of the water? fall, but incorporates the waterfall into its whole being. As the water rushes beneath the living-room floor, mist and vapours rise all around the balconies, which then begin to look like layers of clouds floating up through the forest cover into the sky. Fallingwater, as its name implies, is thus not simply a static representation of natural appear ances. Rather, it is an image of nature preceived in the process of growth and change. As in Picasso's Girl before a Mirror, external appearance and inner reality are both represented by reflection in space and extension in time. Within just a few years, Picasso and Wright then expanded the range of their representational subject matter beyond the lyrical to encompass the tragic dimension. This development was brought to a climax in Guernica, painted in 1937 (Fig. 22), and Taliesin West, begun in the following year (Fig. 23). Each, in its own way, gives monu? mental expression to the human condition as man is seen face to face with destiny. In Guernica, inspired by the terror-bombing of that town during the Spanish Civil War, the brutality of war is not depicted as a current event but is recognized in the recurring pattern of human existence. The geometric shape of a classical pediment gives stability to a composition of violently jarring forms that is imprinted forever on our minds under the relentless all-seeing eye of the sun. In Taliesin West, the jagged forms of the desert are likewise brought under the control of a geometric order of stabilizing diagonals, echo? ing the mountain shapes beyond and recalling the ancient Mediter? ranean sites of Knossos and Mycenae. But the interminable and pitiless sunburned desert is what Taliesin West is all about, that 'vast battleground of titanic natural forces'82 where Wright found the means to express his realization that 'Nature is Fate'.83 Taliesin West makes no attempt at permanent shelter. Light canvas is stretched over wood frames secured to the tops of low walls of 'desert concrete'. Like Wright's description of the desert itself, it is 'earth-trimmed rock, prostrate to the sun', openly accepting the fact that 'all life there dies a sun-death'.84 The colour of ashes that lies over Guernica finds its counterpart in the continuous maze of low-lying stone walls that look like the recycled ruins of an earlier civilization destroyed by the same 'sun-principle' that has given this encampment temporary life.85 Right from the beginning that illusion of being an unwitting accom? plice in a drama transcending the specifics of time and place was so vivid that Wright's wife Olgivanna felt 'the whole opus looked like something we had not been building, but excavating'.86 In contrast to most modern attempts on the part of representational art to deal with the tragic, Guernica and Taliesin West are neither pompous nor sentimentalizing. The universality of their meaning was partly achieved through the use of fragments taken from the real world, common or found objects given symbolic meaning in their new contexts. In Guernica, an ordinary light bulb becomes the mech? anized eye of the sun, focusing attention on the inescapable actuality l6 AA FILES 11</page><page sequence="15">18.

In Taliesin West, two volcanic boulders inscribed with ancient petroglyphs are placed at the entrance to the compound and on the steps above the pool, marking the axes extending from the mountains above to the desert floor below. Looking perhaps as if they had rolled down from the mountains during the cataclysm that destroyed the previous inhabitants of the site, they literally force us to read the architecture as primordial and remind us that the present building shares a history with nature. The illusion of continuity between architecture and nature thus assumes a tragic cast as it involves the dimension of time, an evidence of the eternal which, as in Guernica, gives poignant meaning to the reality around us. During World War II and after, Wright and Picasso broadened and simplified their styles, relying more and more heavily on using easily recognizable images or even ready-made objects. Perhaps the most celebrated of Picasso's are the Head of a Bull (1943) (Fig. 24), a combin? ation of bicycle seat and handlebars, and the Baboon and Young (1951), a figure of motherly affection seen through the eyes/headlamps of a cast toy automobile. But, in the heroic, pre-Pop world of Abstract Expressionism and Brutalism, when such conceits were turned into major paintings or buildings they could easily be dismissed as merely cute or simplistic one-liners. For his most important work of the period, the Guggenheim Museum, Wright combined an upside-down Tower of Babel with the shell of a chambered nautilus to express the twofold qualities of continuity in space and progression through time that he felt were appropriate to the experience of viewing modern art. The programme for a Country Club in Hollywood for Huntington Hartford (1947) (Fig. 25) obviously had different associations. The futuristic scheme is composed of a stack of flying saucers moored to a concrete trunk, like mushrooms growing on a tree, a combination of technology and nature-worship right at home in the world that gave us The Invasion of the Body-Snatchers. For the First Unitarian Church in Shorewood Hills, Wisconsin (1947-51), Wright sought an 'expres? sion of reverence without recourse to the steeple'.87 He designed 'the whole edifice', as he said, 'in the attitude of prayer', and compared the pointed, aspiring shape of the roof to two hands joined in that ges? ture.88 As in Picasso's Baboon and Young, where the conventional image of Mother and Child is recast through modern eyes, Wright found an equivalent for the historical form of the steeple in a familiar natural sign. During the 1950s, the seventh decade of their careers, an explicit interest in the historical source of artistic conventions finally came to the surface and began to dominate their work in a way that seemed to contravene all the practices of modernism. Wright's colonnaded, arcaded, and domed designs of the period culminated in the Marin County Civic Center, planned in 1957 and begun in 1959, the year he died (Fig. 26). Set in a landscape of rolling hills, and scaled to the surrounding highways and neighbouring Golden Gate Bridge, Wright's building avoids any other reference to the concrete and steel forms of engineering so characteristic of the work of most modern architects at the time. Instead, the two long wings that emerge from low hills and join in a central, domed rotunda are enclosed by a range of superposed arcades finished in pinkish-tan stucco and roofed over by a blue plastic vault. The imagery is obviously that of a Roman aqueduct. Indeed, the arcades crossing the valley, with their fluid aquamarine crest, seem to be carrying the water down from Mt Tamalpais to the San Pablo Bay, like a modern Pont du Gard, symbol? izing the importance of regional government. As in a Romantic landscape painting or garden, ancient history is called upon to 'improve' nature, to make, as Wright said, 'the landscape more beautiful than it was before'.89 In its reference to classical Roman architecture, Wright's last major work recalls, as in a dream, one of his first, the project for the Mil? waukee Public Library of 1893. The forms are now thinner, flattened out, and dematerialized, creating an appropriately modern image of large-scale public 'decoration', similar to Matisse's contemporary poster-like cut-outs.90 But, in returning to the historical sources of his own work, Wright again seems closer to Picasso in the desire both artists shared to penetrate the meaning of representation as an act involving both nature and history. At about the same moment that Wright was designing the Guggenheim Museum, Picasso painted a variation of Poussin's Triumph of Pan to celebrate the liberation of Paris in August 1944. Then, in 1951, he turned to Goya's Third of May, 1808 and Manet's Execution of Maximilian as models for his Massacre in Korea, an anti-war statement in 'modern (i.e., futuristic) dress'. But Picasso soon began imitating the art of the past, not so much in search of a compositional vehicle, as a meditation on the very meaning of art as imitation. First came the series based on Delacroix's Women of Algiers, done in 1954-5; then the more than twenty versions of Velazquez's Las Meninas, two years later; and, finally, the even more numerous series of paintings based on Manet's Dejeuner sur VHerhe, started in 1959 (Fig. 27). Beginning in the twenties, with such works as the Painter with a Model Knitting, Picasso had made the making of art a major theme of his work, but now, near the end of his career, he went beyond the depiction of the relation between the artist and his V 24.

The parallel between Wright and Picasso, even as schematically presented here, offers one very striking piece of evidence, that there is a logic and a pattern to the development of rep? resentation in twentieth-century art. This contradicts the fundamen? tal teleology of modernism, which assumes a historical necessity only in the tendency toward abstraction.91 Since abstraction is considered the natural expression of the modern machine age, any reaction or swerving from that goal must be adventitious. If that is not the case, as I hope to have shown, then the exclusionary principle of modernism, on which the antithesis between Wright and the International Style was based, should finally be dispensed with. This, of course, has already happened in fact, with the rise of post-modernism almost twenty years ago, a development in which, it should be noted, both Hitchcock and Johnson played major roles. It is only left for academic theory and criticism to catch up, which is not unimportant. For, until we remove the post- from modernism as well as the half- or pre- from Wright's place in it, we will continue to be denying ourselves part of our own history.92 The antithesis between Wright and the Inter? national Style makes it quite clear that history was not the only victim of a reductive modernism. So was nature. The pattern of represent? ation in twentieth-century art has revealed something that has always been assumed, though never made so clear ? that the conception of nature in art is a historical one, and that the conventions of architec? tural representation establishing the continuity between the figure of the building and the ground of its site emerge out of this recognition.

This position had been clearly stated in the early 1920s in the magazine De Stijl by Van Doesburg as well as Piet Mondrian. In an article published in 1923, entitled 'From the New Aesthetic to its Material Realization', Van Doesburg declared: 'Only in our time has the leading art form, painting, shown the way which architecture must take in order that it may . . . realize in material form what is already present in [painting] ... in imaginary (aesthetic) form' (in Jaffe, De Stijl, p. 181). In the same volume, in an article entitled 'Is Painting Secondary to Architecture?', Mondrian noted that, since painting had shown the way towards abstraction, it naturally followed that 'the new aesthetic for architecture is that of the new painting' (ibid. p. 184). 11.

In this sense, a figurative work of art need not be representational, that is, an imitation of reality. Figuration, therefore, is either a more general notion than representation or a more limited one, as when it refers to the imitation of a figure. In neither case, however, do I take it to be synonymous with representation, which has a much more definite historical meaning. For a recent discussion of figuration in its more general meaning, see Michael Graves, 'A Case for a Figurative Architecture', in Michael Graves: Build? ings and Projects, 1966-1981, edited by Karen Vogel Wheeler, Peter Arnell, and Ted Bickford (New York: Rizzoli International Publications, 1982), n-13. 30.

Here, obviously, the traditional distinction between construction and decoration is the key. Almost all historical forms of decoration were figurative or naturalistic, but this was considered sculptural or pictorial embellishment. The proportional relation between the classical orders and the human body was, however, taken more literally by some during the Renaissance and well into the late eighteenth century (see, for example, Rudolf Wittkower, Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism, Columbia University Studies in Art History and Archaeology, No. 1 (New York: Random House, 1965) and Emil Kaufmann, Architecture in the Age of Reason (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1955)). And the analogy with the body, when used for expressive purposes, could result in an architecture of highly figurative or anthropomorphic character, as in the late Baroque. This theory of expression, coupled with the psychology of empathy, has had an important legacy in the twentieth century through the highly popular book by Geoffrey Scott, The Architecture of Humanism: A Study in the History of Taste, first published in 1914.

Colin Rowe's extended comparison between Le Corbusier's architecture of the twenties and the Cubist painting of Picasso, Gris, and Leger in his article 'Transparency: Literal and Phenomenal' (Perspecta 8 (1963), 45-54) is purely formalistic. In saying that 'any Cubist canvas of 1911-12 could serve to illustrate' his point, he admits that the issue of representation, or subject matter, is not an issue, which is exactly what I believe separates Picasso from Le Corbusier, as it does Picasso from Gris! The comparison between Picasso and Le Corbusier seems to stem from John Summerson's essay 'Architecture, Painting and Le Corbusier', published in Heavenly Mansions in 1949. 81. Clement Greenberg, Art and Culture: Critical Essays (Boston: Beacon Press, 1961), 77 ('Collage', 1959). Greenberg explained the paradox as follows: 'Cubism, in its 1911-1912 phase ... was on the verge of abstract art.... It was then that Picasso and Braque were confronted with a unique dilemma: they had to choose between illusion and representation. If they opted for illusion, it could only be illusion per se ? an illusion of depth, and of relief, so general and abstracted, as to exclude the representation of individual objects. If on the other hand, they opted for represent? ation, it had to be representation per se ? representation as image pure and simple, without connotations (at least, without more than schematic ones) of the three dimensional space in which the objects represented originally existed. ... In the end, Picasso and Braque plumped for the representational, and it would seem they</page><page sequence="19">did so deliberately' (pp. 77-8). 82. Wright, Autobiography, p. 333. 83. F. L.

It is interesting to recall Frank Stella's statement in 1969 that his 'main interest has been to make what is popularly called decorative painting truly viable in unequivocal abstract terms. Decorative, that is, in a good sense, in the sense that it is applied to Matisse.' It is further interesting to note that he concluded with the thought that 'maybe this is beyond abstract painting. I don't know . . . ' (quoted in W. Rubin, Frank Stella (New York: Museum of Modern Art, 1970), 149). 91. It is surely for this reason that no coherent development is seen in the traditional architecture of the twentieth century. As Hitchcock noted, 'the subject of tra? ditional architecture ... can now be seen to have been not so much a cul-de-sac as a road without a goal', for 'The standards of traditionalism . . . were still on the whole nineteenth-century ones' (H.-R. Hitchcock, Architecture: Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, The Pelican History of Art, 3rd edition (Baltimore, Md.: Penguin Books, 1968), 409. And only recently, it should be noted, has expression? ism in all its various forms come to seem to have a 'history'. The hardcore modernist position in painting, likewise, sees as little rhyme or reason in Picasso's work after the Cubist period as architectural critics have seen in Wright's later work. 'There are reasons why Picasso clings to the representational', wrote Clement Greenberg in 1946, 'yet the inherent logic of his course as an artist drives him toward the abstract, today as much as thirty years ago', and Greenberg then blamed 'the helpless, almost vulgar way' his images are painted on 'this frus? trated logic' (Art and Culture, p. 122). In his essay of 1957 on 'Picasso at Seventy Five', Greenberg wrote: 'Like any authentic style, Cubism had its own inherent laws of development, which seemed in the late 1920s to be driving toward abstrac? tion. Mondrian drew the extreme consequences of this tendency. ... It was Picasso's double insistence on the schematic integrity of every image he took from nature ? and he has always taken every image from nature ? and on a minimal illusion of three-sided space, that began in the 1930s to interfere with the fulfillment of his art_Picasso refused to draw the lessons of his own experience' (ibid. p. 64). 92. One of the first to appreciate the relevance of Wright to the architecture that ran counter to late International Style modernism was Vincent Scully. See his 'Frank Lloyd Wright and Twentieth-Century Style', Problems of the Nineteenth and Twen? tieth Century, vol. 4, Studies in Western Art: Acts of the Twentieth International Congress of the History of Art (Princeton, N.

The subtitle should have read 'The International Style and Frank Lloyd Wright', rather than 'The International Style of Frank Lloyd Wright'. Author's changes (excluding minor corrections of spelling and punctuation) which should have been incorporated in both text and notes are as follows (in bold typeface): p. 3, para. 1, line 4: Frank Lloyd Wright, an antithesis that had begun to surface in the critical literature during the preceding five years. p. 3, para. 1, line 10: Wright intensified his campaign p. 3, para. 1, line 14: modern architecture' .3 For their part, supporters of the modern movement would later maintain that Le Cor busier, when asked just a few years before what he thought of Wright, pushed aside any question of influence by saying that he had never even heard of him!4 p. 3, para. 3, line 11: 'two histories of architecture', in addition to 'the obvious story of conflicting revivals', the one involved with a search for forms independent' of any outside reference, the other 'concerned with the developments in pure engineering'.7 p. 4, para. 4, line 16: his own desert camp in Arizona, named Ocatilla after the local cactus and painted a rose tint in imitation of the light on the desert floor, with scarlet red highlights the colour of the cactus flower (1929). p. 5, line 1: exhibition. As with Picasso, it was impossible to deny his place in modern art, for he had shown the way towards the new aesthetic of abstraction, even if he had not fully embraced it. But, to justify his inclusion as more than merely a precursor involved a fairly subtle paraphrase of the argument for the growth of abstraction. As the exception that proved the rule, Wright served the didactic purpose of antithesis.20 p. 5, para. 3, line 8: The difference between the romantic individualism of Wright and the classical objectivity of the International Style was actually, then, a disagreement over the role of figuration that ultimately involved the distinction between a representational and an abstract architecture.29 p. 6, para. 4, line 13: growing on branches p. 7, line 1: the vernacular followed the academic, and in the United States the clapboard Greek Revival town hall p. 7, para. 5, line 8: while in the Midway Gardens (1913-14) p. 11, line 3: the painter at his easel, looking over towards his model, who is knitting. p. 11, para. 5, line 15: bypassing all those conventions that have historically functioned as mediators between nature and architecture.

The subtitle should have read The International Style and Frank Lloyd Wright', rather than 'The International Style of Frank Lloyd Wright'. Author's changes (excluding minor corrections of spelling and punctuation) which should have been incorporated in both text and notes are as follows (in bold typeface): p. 3, para. 1, line 4: Frank Lloyd Wright, an antithesis that had begun to surface in the critical literature during the preceding five years. p. 3, para. 1, line 10: Wright intensified his campaign p. 3, para. 1, line 14: modern architecture' .3 For their part, supporters of the modern movement would later maintain that Le Corbusier, when asked just a few years before what he thought of Wright, pushed aside any question of influence by saying that he had never even heard of him!4 p. 3, para. 3, line 11: 'two histories of architecture', in addition to 'the obvious story of conflicting revivals', the one involved with a search for forms 'independent' of any outside reference, the other 'concerned with the developments in pure engineering'.7 p. 4, para. 4, line 16: his own desert camp in Arizona, named Ocatilla after the local cactus and painted a rose tint in imitation of the light on the desert floor, with scarlet red highlights the colour of the cactus flower (1929). p. 5, line 1: exhibition. As with Picasso, it was impossible to deny his place in modern art, for he had shown the way towards the new aesthetic of abstraction, even if he had not fully embraced it. But, to justify his inclusion as more than merely a precursor involved a fairly subtle paraphrase of the argument for the growth of abstraction. As the exception that proved the rule, Wright served the didactic purpose of antithesis.20 p. 5, para. 3, line 8: The difference between the romantic individualism of Wright and the classical objectivity of the International Style was actually, then, a disagreement over the role of figuration that ultimately involved the distinction between a representational and an abstract architecture.29 p. 6, para. 4, line 13: growing on branches p. 7, line 1: the vernacular followed the academic, and in the United States the clapboard Greek Revival town hall p. 7, para. 5, line 8: while in the Midway Gardens (1913-14) p. 11, line 3: the painter at his easel, looking over towards his model, who is knitting. p. 11, para. 5, line 15: bypassing all those conventions that have historically functioned as mediators between nature and architecture. Taliesin could4 safely abandon forms ... held through habit or tradition', since, in Wright's terms, 'it goes to the roots'.55 p. 12, para. 2, line 3: The building of the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo necessitated a dozen Pacific crossings. And it was the automobile that allowed p. 12, para. 3, line 5: load-bearing masonry walls, with foundations sunk deep in the earth, the house is composed of boxy rooms, p. 12, para. 4, line 13: Villa Savoie at Poissy (1928-30) p. 12, para. 4, line 16: Villa Stein at Garches (1926-8) p. 13, para. 2, line 8: a combination of human being and machine, p. 13, para. 5, line 2: Mies's Barcelona Pavilion (1928-9) p. 14, line 2: The Bauhaus had come to stand for an entirely new idea of artistic education; the careers of Le Corbusier and Mies had begun to take off; p. 14, para. 2, line 3: Fallingwater (1934-7), Broadacre City (1932-5), p. 14, para. 3, line 1: Broadacre City grew directly out of the rural American landscape and put every citizen in touch with the ground. 'Here,' Wright claimed, 'architecture is landscape and landscape takes on the character of architecture.'698 In Fallingwater p. 14, para. 3, line 10: stretches of 'desert rubble stone' and then p. 14, para. 3, line 14: Taliesin West was intended by Wright to look as if it 'belonged to p. 14, para. 4, line 13: the Capitol at Chandigarh (begun 1951), the Monastery of La Tourette (1953-60), p. 15, para. 2, line 5: living and working in a world of their own making, and creating around themselves a myth of genius. p. 16, para. 1, line 17: Ocatilla p. 16, para. 2, line 5: Fallingwater (1934-7) p. 16, para. 4, line 9: 'desert rubble stone'. Like p. 18, line 1: In Taliesin West, prehistoric stone boulders inscribed with Indian petroglyphs are p. 19, para. 2, line 20: So was nature.93 The p. 19, para. 2, line 24: representation defining the continuity p. 19, note to follow main text: This essay was written in 1982 and first presented as a lecture in the spring of that year at the symposium on 'The International Style in Perspective: 1932-1982', held at the Graduate School of Design, Harvard University. p. 19, Notes 3. (line3) (February 1932), 6-8. These articles were preceded by the somewhat more moderated attacks in, among others, Wright's review of Le Corbusier's Towards a New Architecture (World Unity, 2 September 1928,393-5) and his Princeton Lectures (Modern Architecture, Being the Kahn Lectures for 1930 (Princeton, New Jersey, 1931).
