<plain_text><page sequence="1">Marija Gimbutas. The Gods and Goddesses of Old Europe, 7000 to 3500 B. C. Myths, Legends and Cult Images. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1974. Pp. 303; (incl.) 252 ill., 171 figs., 8 maps. $20.00. The recent work of A. Marshack (The Roots of Civilization and related articles) demonstrates that we have much to learn from fresh approaches to the study of prehistoric art and religion. While there is still much controversy over some of Marshack's conclusions, at least our attention is commended to them by the originality, rigor and thoroughness of his methods of examination. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the work under review here. Gimbutas proposes that: 1) there is an area, roughly the Balkans and adjacent areas, which we can call "Old Europe"; 2) this area had, until waves of semi-nomadic Indo-European invaders broke over it, a "civilization," even a script, of its own; 3) by examining and analysing the plastic and decorative art of cultures within Old Europe we can gain some knowledge of the religious beliefs and practices of this civilization; and 4) we can trace the descendants of these images and ideas in the plastic and decorative art of the third millennium B. C. Aegean, in the art and religion of Minoan Crete, and even in the religion of classical Greece. To this end she has examined and illustrated an enormous body of material, demonstrating once again the extraordinary range of her scholarship and familiarity with languages and material not normally accessible to Western scholars. Some of the ideas presented, especially the general notion of Old Europe as the parent of Minoan civilization rather than anything imported from the Near East, are intriguing. But the argumentation in general is so imprecise, confused, and undocumented as to render any acceptance of the conclusions as acts of faith. The contrast with the method and conclusions of P. Ucko (in Anthropomorphic Figurines of Predynastic Egypt and Neolithic Crete ... .), a work not even alluded to in Gimbutas' text, could not be greater. He has proposed that a rigorous and uniform framework for description be set up, after which we can begin to draw meaningful conclusions from the large corpus of material at hand. Gimbutas' method seems to work in reverse order. Vague general concepts or images such as the snake/bird goddess (Ch. 7) are posited, illustrated with a few examples, then buttressed with parallels drawn from very diverse sources, often poorly documented. The dangers of such an indiscriminate use of ethnographic parallels are obvious. Another fault is the apparent lack of discrimination in treating what are surely universal symbols, such as bulls' horns, as concrete cultural artifacts indicating cultural interconnection and continuity. More serious is what seems to be deliberate falsification of evidence. Text</page><page sequence="2">SEPTEMBER 1976 THE CLASSICAL WORLD 49 illustration 61 purports to show "a bird standing on an egg" (p. 106). The "egg" in fact is simply the base of the vessel around which a band has been painted (VHS Suppl. IV [1904] pl. XVI:20)- as in all other examples of this shape (p1. XVI: 11-21). Thus the reviewer feels that, for whatever value the book may have as a collection of otherwise inaccessible material, it is of little real worth to the specialist, and virtually none to an unsuspecting reading public.
