<plain_text><page sequence="1">GAUTAMAVAJRA VAJRACARYA AND MARY SHEPHERD SLUSSER A NEWLY DISCOVERED GARUDA IMAGE IN KATHMANDU, NEPAL n a previous issue of Artibus Asiae* we discussed at some length the Jalasayana image of Hanim~in Dhokd palace. At the time of our study the image was totally immersed in the waters of the surrounding pool which we could not obtain permission to drain. At the wa- ter's subsidence during the winter months we hoped at least to inspect the image from afar from the adjacent rooftops outside the compound. Unfortunately, subsidence was so minimal that the Ndrdyana image did not reveal itself. Nonetheless, we were favored with the partial emergence of the divinity's mount, another remarkable Garuda which now may be joined to the series of early Garuda images mentioned in the previous paper. The HaniimIn Dhokd Garuda (Fig. I) presumably kneels at the feet of his unseen master, Ndrdyana. Like the other early Garudas it is anthropomorphic and, speculatively, may well be yet another royal portrait image. Reflecting the faces of the gods and kings previously described, the face of the Hanim~in Dhok- Garuda is sublime. Like them it has a short, rounded face, aquiline nose and ridged brows, a pointed chin, and a sensuously modelled mouth with char- acteristic pouting lower lip. The crown, an elaborate pompon-adorned helmet displays as its central emblem a detailed Face of Glory, the kirtimukha. This emblem may be closely compared to many of the seventh century occurrences previously discussed. Unfortunately, to date it has been possible only to study the partially revealed image wist- fully and from afar. If it becomes possible, close inspection of the complete image will certainly reveal new details and permit comparison with other early Garudas, particularly the Sdkonhd Garuda now at Ndrdyana Hiti. It is not impossible in a country so full of art historical surprises that the Garu&lt;da's supporting pedestal may prove to bear a dedicatory inscription. This would surely solve many a riddle respecting both the superb Garuda and the master image it adores. * See Artibus Asiae, vol.
