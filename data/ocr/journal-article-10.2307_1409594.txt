<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rediscovering the Sacred From the Secular to a Postmodern Sense of the Sacred Arnoldo C. Vento efore looking into a postmodern sense of the sacred, one must first look at the present state of contemporary modern society: its ori- gins, characteristics, and development. According to Harvard theolo- gian Harvey Cox, the nation-state system, a scientifically grounded technology, a bureaucratic rationalism, an incessant drive for econom- ic growth, and the secularization of religion characterize the contem- porary modern society.' In a global climate strongly influenced by Western values, it is not surprising that the concept of the secular state or secularization of religion has become both a model of emulation and a target for critical rejection, the latter due to a resurgent and increas- ing influence of religion on public life. Cox, in his Religion in the Secular City, sees as exemplary of this new movement the events in Poland, the &gt; popularity of the Pope, the rise of the Islamic religion, the rise of the Moral Majority, the pastoral letter of the American Catholic bishops, and the liberation theology in Latin America.2 Still, since the French and American revolutions and the formal separation of church and state, v the secular state has been intact, the church constitutionally indiffer- 3 183 ent from the claims of the state. It has been a model that has been influ- ential on an international scale, partly as a colonialist legacy, but also as a means of postcolonialist nation building.3 According to David R. Gress, the West is a symbiosis of religion and secularity. If religion withers, the result is not the health but the per- version of secularity.4 Allen Guelzo in his Selling God in America points to</page><page sequence="2">a long-standing dualism within Christianity between the sacred and the secular. However, whenever the boundaries shift between a certain unspoken consensus about its definitions, commercialization sets in as it did during the Reformation.5 One might add that, even before the Reformation, the Roman Catholic Church during the Middle Ages was involved in simony and gross commercialization.6 This commercializa- tion of religion has invaded further, the by-product of New Age cul- ture: New Age science, healing, and personal growth, channeling, neo- paganism, and the millennial idea of a New Age. Wouter Hanegraaff, however, concludes from his exposition that New Age religion is an expression of popular Western culture criticism directed against the dualism and reductionism that, perceived as characteristic of rationalist philosophy and science and dogmatic Christianity, is held responsible for the world crisis.7 We live in an era of posts: post-cold war, postmodern, post- industrial, post-Christian, postideological, postmaterialist, and post- Eurocentric. The denizens of the post-era, according to Gress, can only look forward to endless rounds of analyzing the rationalist, ro- mantic, revolutionary, reactionary, multiculturalist, American, pagan, Christian, liberal, and conservative.8 In our contemporary industrial and postindustrial societies, many groups and social phenomena seem religious in character but lack a true sense of religion. The ambiguity resides in the ongoing debate over the definition of "religion." Most conventional groups and scholars employ functional and substantial definitions that draw the line differently at the margins. Now a com- promise delineates marginal groups as "quasi-religions," additionally, "para-religions," or secular religions; these are groups that deal with ul- timate dynamics in a way similar to the way religious organizations do but that do not have explicitly supernatural or superempirical beliefs or referents.9 Conversely, and since the Enlightenment, mainstream theology has focused on making religion credible to modern scientific man, resulting in an excess of accommodation to a modern world in decay. Cox believes the problem has been the use of a "top-down approach-from the great thinkers to the clergy to the people." The alternative for postmodern theology and the modern world is a process "that must come from the bottom up."10 Most important is not only a definition of religion and secular religions within the historical Western u context, but also a redefinition of the sacred beyond the institutional 184 s and secularization of the metaphysical and transcendental idea of the Divinity. The latter cannot assume the current structural decay of socie- ty worldwide; it must be seen within an evolutionary path that antici- pates a cyclical end and beginning. If there is one area that all philoso- phers and scientists have agreed on, it is that everything changes, nothing remains the same. The age of linear thinking and materialistic progress is coming to an end. Many of the great thinkers, from Alfred</page><page sequence="3">North Whitehead to Octavio Paz, have dealt with this idea.' Visionar- ies from the East and the West have further corroborated this idea, call- ing for a return to a new philosophy that is both basic and eternal in values. The West is at the end of a long cycle as it completes its tenure, that is, the West as we have known it in the past millennia. There are those who see material progress as a measure of success in culture and society, who see capitalism, science, and liberal democracy on the verge of embracing the vast majority of the world's people. This glob- alization originates in a society that is fragmented at its social and cul- tural core, notwithstanding that a provider of economic inequities into haves and have-nots is perhaps the essence of the conflict. Today, the U.S. model is riddled with conflict: racism, fights over abortion, prayer in schools, educational collapse in the public schools, role of the gov- ernment in protecting the welfare of families, corruption throughout many of our institutions (politicians, clergy, lawyers, doctors, hospi- tals, businesses both large and small). Americans have come to realize that the political animal and the system is not to be trusted. We now know that sixteen thousand Americans, including children and new- borns, were subjected to 154 human radiation tests by the Atomic Energy Commission. We know that cancer rates are increasing at an alarming rate due to toxins in the food chain, pesticides, and chemical pollutants. A one-year-old child will receive lifetime doses of eight pesticides from twenty commonly eaten foods. The poor are getting poorer; the gap between the haves and have-nots is getting wider and will become a serious problem in the future. Health care is not avail- able to over thirty million Americans. This society has created the poor and the homeless who are subjected to disease and higher mortality rates; these will become the lepers of the twenty-first century. The two-party political system is an illusion; the number of zeros on con- tracts decides policies. What some of the public has seen is a unilateral support by Washington for issues that polarize the voting public: high defense spending, war on the environment, Mexican savings and loan bailouts, GATT, NAFTA, foreign aid, and corporate welfare. The de- mographics are unmistakable: the break-up of the family, the aging of &gt; the population, the steady decline in average real wages, rising crime, the crisis in education and health care, the degradation of the environ- ment and the corresponding assault on health, the abdication of public responsibility by an overwhelmed, unresponsive, autocratic govern- ment. It is a nation at risk where in education there is a 30 percent drop- 3 185 out rate (50 to 60 percent in urban areas). Illiteracy is now at twenty- o seven million for persons over seventeen years of age, with forty-five ? million more that are barely competent. Competent teachers are leaving the field. Colleges and universi- ties are pricing themselves out of the range of the middle class. A col- lege degree no longer guarantees a good job. As in corporate America,</page><page sequence="4">universities are downsizing, eliminating jobs, curtailing services, and imposing heavier workloads on professors. The quality of education at this level is being questioned. There is a struggle between the Religious Right fundamentalists (U.S. and Islamic) and the secular liberals, Prot- estants, Jews, and Catholics (from secular humanists to New Age re- ligions). The struggle is about what U.S. society and, by extension, modern society and the contemporary and future West should be and not what it is. SECULAR HUMANISM AND THE SECULARIZATION OF RELIGIONS Religion: Man's expression of his acknowledgment of the divine; a system of beliefs and practices relating to the sacred and uniting its adherents in a community. (New Lexicon Webster's Dictionary of the English Language) Among religions in this country which do not teach what would generally be considered a belief in the existence of God are Buddhism, Taoism, Ethical Culture, Secular Humanism and others. (U.S. Supreme Court, 1961) Any system of beliefs, practices, ethical values, e.g., humanism as religion. (Websters New World Dictionary) Secularism: The belief that religious influence should be restricted, es- pecially in education, morality, the state, that these should be independent of the state. (Unabridged English Dictionary) $ Secularism ... is the name for an ideology, a new closed &gt;world view which functions very much like a religion. (Harvey Cox)12 Despite the ruling of the Supreme Court regarding secular hu- u manism as a religion, there are secular humanists that are intent on set- 186 B ting the record straight by citing numerous myths about secular hu- o manism, including that it is a religion. Matt Cherry in his "Ten Myths ? about Secular Humanism" admits to some of the charges. "Secular Humanists don't believe in God or an afterlife.... Secular Humanism encourages people to think for themselves and question authority.... Secular Humanism says the morality of actions should be judged by their consequences in this world."13 Cherry cites misinformation as the</page><page sequence="5">cause for misunderstanding secular humanism. He points to the ab- sence of a central authority or process for indoctrination or conver- sion, ergo no monolithic dogma. They believe that morality and mean- ing come from humanity and the natural world, not from God or the supernatural. They realize that individuals alone cannot solve all our problems, but, rather than turning to the supernatural, they believe that problems are solved by people working together, relying on understanding and creativity. They argue that secular humanism is not a religion because there are no supernatural beliefs, no creeds, sacred texts, or required rituals. Humanists are not required to have faith in what is said by authority, living or dead, human or supernatural. Values are derived through humanistic worldviews, from the natural world. Secular humanism accordingly is a naturalistic, nonreligious world- view.'4 They contend that secular humanism is not a political move- ment and that secular humanists cover a wide spectrum of political views. Cherry contends that the remarkable thing about the United States was precisely that it was created as a secular republic, organized around the rights and freedom of its citizens. Secular humanists refute the idea that the United States was created as a Christian nation and that it is the official religion of the public education system. David A. Noebel maintains that secular humanism is a religion be- cause it contains (as all worldviews contain) a theology. He points to a humanist manifesto in 1923 that speaks in the language of religion. "No Deity will save us, we must save ourselves." Noebel contends that salva- tion is a religious experience.'5 Even more specific is Paul Kurtz's own declaration in his preface to the Humanist Manifestos land II that humanism is a philosophical, religious, and moral point of view. Other humanists view it as a "religion to meet the psychological needs of our time"'6 or argue that its naturalistic frame validates it as a religion.'7 In short, Noebel views secular humanism as a comprehensive worldview that consists of a theology (atheism), philosophy (metaphysical/naturalism), ethics (moral relativism), biology (spontaneous generation/evolution), psychology (self-actualization), sociology (feminism/homosexualism), law (positivism), politics (globalism), economics (socialism), and his- &gt; tory (French Enlightenment). Humanists of the Year Lloyd and Mary Morain, authors of Humanism at the Next Step: An Introduction for Liberal Protestants, Catholics, and Jews, sincerely believe that secular humanism is the historically logical and rational religion to follow in the wake of the other three religions.'8 3 187 Noebel notes further that secular humanist groups on our na- tion's campuses are routinely placed in the religious sections of student directories or handbooks. Some argue against the notion that tradi- tional biblical religions formed the framework of Western religions and established "the orthodox, metaphysical-theological basis of the two modern political philosophies, socialism and liberalism."'9</page><page sequence="6">One has to question some of the assertions made by the afore- mentioned proponents of secular humanism. One of the assumptions is that man/woman is unconnected to any higher source and that this framework alone can solve his/her problems. It affirms that this frame- work derives meaning from the natural world, yet the natural world is devoid of the sacred or connection to the higher divine order. It con- tends that the United States was created as a secular republic orga- nized around the rights and freedoms of its citizens. While the founders were careful not to make the mistake of the Roman Church of mixing church and state, their whole reason for beginning anew in someone else's land was religion itself. Their idea of manifest destiny was im- bued with a type of messianic deliverance in the future. The idea of a new utopia was part of the plan organized by Masons and directed, ac- cording to some obscure sources, by Francis Bacon. Let us not forget that all but one or two of the signers of the Declaration of Indepen- dence were Masons. Religious fervor was intense as fanatical ministers often led raids on Native American villages, pillaging and killing sav- ages they believed were led by Satan.20 Other religious sects not prop- erly belonging to the Church of England were persecuted. One notes that Catholics were not permitted to own arms and were persecuted for belonging to a papist religion. The "rights and freedoms of its citi- zens" did not include Native Americans, Jews, Catholics, or other people who did not fit the specific mindset of colonialists. This exception, noted at its very origins, is still applicable today in the form of racism. While secular humanism is not an official religion of public education, there is no question that early educationists like John Dewey had much to do in establishing the secular humanist framework for public educa- tion. One notes, years later, that Dewey's liberal philosophy impacted curricular policies that have contributed much to the lowering of stan- dards and discipline in public education. The universities have addition- ally contributed to the secularization of the average student, as profes- sors instill and inculcate their own secular agendas upon the young minds. Is secular humanism a religion? Certainly not in the traditional &gt; sense, but there is no doubt that it has its philosophy and its adherents, like Marxists, who preach its ideas just as dogmatically and intensely as the fundamentalists and the Religious Right. Not all modern thought should be discarded. There are positive points within secular human- u ism and Marxism, as there is with the deconstructionist ideas of Derrida. 188 3 But before we conclude on positive futuristic aspects of philosophies, one needs to look further at secularization and modernity. The ideas of modernity and postmodernity have figured promi- nently in social thought. Closely related is the process of seculariza- tion, which has at issue some of the basic questions. Secularization describes a specific social phenomenon, namely, a decline in the extent of religious observance in a given society. It is also a belief in history,</page><page sequence="7">which has entered deeply into contemporary thought beyond the con- fines of sociology. In the last two hundred years, Western culture has undergone a gradual process of secularization. While religion plays an important role in ancient, medieval, and early modern periods, it plays a relatively small part in contemporary modern culture. Moreover, it is a conception of the past in which technological development, increas- ing prosperity, changing moral standards, and the decline of religion are all interconnected.21 Susan Curtis points to Perry Miller's path-breaking studies on the Puritans of New England and their subsequent secularization as a point of departure for scholarship on America's religious experience leading to some form of a secularization theory. Miller's successors continued to relate a series of "breakdowns," that is, a decline from an organic re- ligious golden age to an impersonal, secular, usually materialistic one.22 This led the way to a modernization theory that charted human social development from primitive, religious, tight-knit communities with low levels of technology to complex, rational, impersonal societies marked by industrial activity and city life. Thus, in time, theorists and develop- ers viewed modernization and secularization as processes that loos- ened ties to prerational dependence on tradition and the supernatural, paving the way for scientific thought and internal choice. Consequently, this shift away from a traditional religious worldview was seen as pro- gress.23 Nonetheless, as Curtis points out, periodic awakenings and revivals devoted to "Christianizing" American public life serve as re- minders that making people modern cannot completely erase the urge to find spiritual meaning and a supreme, supernatural force in the uni- verse.24 Beyond the evangelical revivals, one finds additionally the six- ties counterculture variety of various personal creeds, such as "Sheilaism" as explored by Robert Ballah and others,25 as well as the more flamboy- ant phenomena of televangelism of the eighties and the "Jesus waves" of the nineties. There is a tension between the two opposite poles: the state's neutrality of religion and the importance of religion in the lives of many Americans. Curtis asks, can we make sense of religious phe- nomena within a framework of secularization? How can a modern and &gt; presumably secular nation in the twentieth century find itself so con- sistently in the throes of religious turmoil? What are the alternatives to overarching theories like modernization and secularization that do not account for the persistence of religion? Some alternatives point to v discovering the ways that sacred and secular ideas interact and shape 3 189 one another, to recognizing the layered quality of collective and indi- vidual life, and to viewing religion as an integral part of culture. Phillip Hammond's work on the Protestant presence in twentieth-century America suggests that one can insist on the importance of religion in two ways: through sovereignty and centrality and that making such a distinction provides a way of appreciating the coexistence of individual</page><page sequence="8">beliefs and collective principles. "Sovereignty" essentially means au- thority; in contrast, "centrality" is personal. One thread in Hammond's work is the recognition that Protestantism, in particular, and religion, in general, are inseparable parts of culture.26 A cultural approach to the study of American religion moves one outside the modernization, secu- larization framework and includes important values, a way of life, fa- miliar customs, as well as abstract expression and the fine arts. Con- versely, one must also recognize the power of religious ideas, images, symbols, and moral systems to add depth and meaning to other aspects of cultural life.27 Curtis demonstrates that the interplay between vari- ous dimensions of life can have a positive effect for the future. She cites the example that one can see the use of commercial idioms by churches as a new moral investment of importance, a new metaphor for religious community. She is speaking of phrases that reflect religious discourses, such as "a cross to bear," "wearing sackcloth," or the "the bitter cup" that are commonly used in purely secular discussions.28 This interpene- tration of descriptions of everyday life, metaphoric expression, myth- making, and the desire to express the meaningful makes it difficult to identify the boundary between the secular and the sacred. The cultural approach may aid in making those distinctions. Often lacking in the analysis of American religion are the dis- tinct cultural differences of the "other," the minorities. The Spanish- speaking Catholic worshiper, for example, approaches the ritual of the mass in ways very distinct from that of the upper-class urban Catholic. It goes beyond a distinction in worship, into linguistic differences and a different sense of the sacred. Historically, English religion has emphasized the static recurrent aspects of worship. However, between 1530 and 1660 "English became conscious of acting a sacred history as opposed to reenacting it"; reli- gion "was changing from devotion to deliberation."29 Secularization took hold in the sense that English colonists believed that the essential features of their religion could not only survive the separation from other aspects of culture but would be purified in the process. It was the ostensible conversion of Constantine much earlier that originated the absorption of the secular.30 Thereafter, sacred monarchs and church H executives dominated municipal, regional, and even imperial affairs. It was the very privilege and power of the monarch that gave impetus to u the process of resecularization in England in the name of Henry VIII. 190 It was the Henrician intimidation and confiscations of the 1530s that gave it the name of the "age of plunder."31 Generations of church offi- cials were helpless to stop the march from Henry VIII to Thomas Hobbes. Nothing was sacred anymore. A spiritual and reflective reli- gion relinquished its social role and political influence. The first re- forms often featured a repudiation of political compromise, religious formalism, and sacred object; no state, rite, or thing was sacred. Some</page><page sequence="9">studies have focused on the apparent psychological cost of "individual- ized faith," regarding pastoral care as a kind of tyranny and inward journeys as tours of hell, pointing out Calvinist cruelties and the tenta- cles Calvinism could extend into the individual psyche. Consolation was there but the price was affliction.32 Peter Kaufman's description of religion on the run was identifiably Protestant and early modern.33 Jean Delumeau studied the practice of la pastorale de la peur across the channel by both Protestants and Catholics, where each could be tyrants on ei- ther side of the confessional divide. He concludes that piety often de- pended on culpabilization.34 Often, it was the contrite Calvinist's route to readiness and submission, less a spiritual state than a spiritual exer- cise. In the end, the church during the 1530s lost its power not only over the laity, but even over itself. On the other hand, Calvinism's "sil- lie base minstrie" exercised something of a tyranny over the souls of the faithful. Secularization and the decline of religions are connected to the idea of modernity. Religion receives a whole new revision in the nine- teenth century with Hegel, Feuerbach, Marx, and Comte. Hegel viewed history as progressive, as a dialectical process in which better social forms, whose denizens have a higher level of understanding, emerge from less good ones. Philosophy, in Hegel's view, gives a rationaliza- tion of Christianity, a rational form to the truths that are embodied but obscured within the Christian religion. However, by rationalizing reli- gion, one also eliminates its mystical essence. This is what Ludwig Feuerbach attempts to do in The Essence of Christianity, a systematic rein- terpretation into humanistic terms. Marx, however, gives a materialist interpretation of Hegel's general historical framework. Where Hegel saw technological advance under capitalism, Marx thought human- kind's real liberation could only be realized when the economic and social order was radically restructured. Religion was the opiate of the people because it numbed the miseries of this world. But once the tech- nological means of actually ameliorating the hardships of human exis- tence was at hand, the illusions of religion would be abandoned be- cause they would be needed no longer. Technology replaces prayer &gt; and religion; the state will wither away in postcapitalist society. For Auguste Comte the past is divided into three stages: (1) the theologi- cal, when the natural world was believed to be full of animating spirits; this world gave way to (2) the metaphysical, when men sought ratio- nalistic explanations; this was replaced by (3) the " positive" or scientific 3 191 age. The general theory of secularization can be understood vis-a-vis the aforementioned framework. It states that because history is progres- ? sive, the decline of religion is desirable, and finally that the decline of religion is evident.35 As evidence of the decline in religion, some will point to the 86 percent of the European community with no connection of any kind</page><page sequence="10">with organized religion, and the remaining 14 percent tenuous at best. Furthermore, there is a steep decline in the number of vocations to priesthoods and ministries and a near collapse in vocations to religious orders. On the other hand, there is no similar decline in the United States. In Eastern Europe, interest in the Christian religion is rising, and in Third World countries, particularly Spanish America, the num- ber and population is growing at a very rapid pace. One can also add Islam to the list as a religion on the move worldwide.36 In speaking of modernity, and by extension the modern mind, we mean the modern scientific, technological, and intellectual structures that gave rise to existing modern society, in which one assumes a men- tality that can no longer accept magical and supernatural elements as an essential part of religion. Those who follow this line of thinking point to the evidence of "progress." Modern medicine, relying on bio- chemistry and pharmacology as opposed to religious charms and in- cantations, the new physics, has replaced Aquinas's cosmological argu- ment, and Darwin has replaced divine design.37 While this account of modernity is highly selective of the facts, there remain, for example, natural, noninvasive remedies in alternative medicine that are return- ing to the source and away from drug orientations with harmful side effects. The new physics sounds impressive, but is it really a model of today's society? I propose that the new physics paradigm is the op- posite of what the Western mind has represented since the days of Constantine. We are still viewing the world in linear, mechanistic, and rational forms representative of past eras. I believe the problem resides in that the modern mind reflects precisely its own reality, i.e., a frag- mented, conflicting, and confusing reality. The idea that science has brought us to a golden age of enlightenment is an illusion and a wish for the materialist dogma of secularism. I submit that society of the late twentieth century is still quite primitive. If it were not, why do we still use invasive surgery? Why is the payload of a rocket 90 percent fuel? Why do we still have the combustion engine in our automobiles almost a century later? If we are so civilized and advanced, why do we have an alarming crime rate throughout the nation, a 30 percent dropout rate in public education, and a food chain that is so contaminated that Europeans won't touch it? Why is there no clear understanding of what the mind is? The ills of modernity are showing and we call this "pro- gress." There is no question that a new definition of economics, gov- 192 ernment, religion, and philosophy is needed. The mentality of the o West is at the core of the problem. Man must address his conflict and fragmentation with honesty and sincerity. It no longer suffices to ratio- nalize, as secular humanists have attested, that the sacred today is sim- ply new patterns and expressions,38 that sports are a religious experi- ence.39 Nor is it sufficient for the Religious Right to pontificate what God has in mind, to dictate the bonus of dispensationalism, and to</page><page sequence="11">wage a jihad against the civic state, considering all liberal thinkers as degenerates.40 TOWARD A DEFINITION OF THE SACRED "Sacred," in a functional definition, refers to consecrated or holy, usual- ly for the worship of the divine. What is sacred for one culture or reli- gion may be different for another. Still, it applies to that which is not connected to the material world, that which is not worldly, humane, or mundane. It properly belongs to the realm beyond the physical, ac- cepting the idea that there is a greater intelligence that governs all life on Earth. One of the problems of modern man is that he is still in the in- fancy of his mental development, and, as such, his science is likewise primitive, especially when one considers the enormous complexity of a billion universes. The arguments with respect to existence of spirits, other intelligences outside our realm, the connection of the mind to the bioplasmic body in a conceptual self-organizing structure, and the altering of space and molecular patterns are still gray areas in our infant scientific stage. There is too much that we cannot prove or disprove because we simply do not have the tools to measure and verify un- known phenomena. How we view the reality and the universe in the future will have much to do with how we must deal with ourselves, how we must govern. How we will think in the future is at the core of the new worldview; the question of humankind's harmony at all levels will constitute the core of the new worldview. Today it is obvious that the world is characterized by philosophies, ideologies, and economic sys- tems that do not provide harmony within humankind. The emphasis has been placed in the wrong places. The proof is in the current socio- economic, political, and religious diaspora that projects a society of conflict and denial totally fragmented and out of harmony with the metaphysical laws of the universe. There is a kind of "God-shaped hole in many people's lives."41 As we approach the end of the century, many educated people in the Western world long for some type of spirituali- ty akin to the traditional religious path. Langdon Gilkey's Theology and the Sciences deals with the perennial chasm that exists between science and religion, stating that science is a dependable and accurate way of knowing the world, but science is not the only way of knowing. As in earlier works, Gilkey complains that the objectivizing approach of sci- 3 193 ence too readily overlooks the subjective element in the universe, in- cluding that of scientist as knower. There are alternative ways of know- ing, says Gilkey, in particular intuitions of nature's wholeness and value, intuitions best expressed symbolically. The primal awareness of nature's power, vitality, and order manifested in archaic religions gives the notion of nature as the mirror of God, and within its framework an</page><page sequence="12">order where life and death are intrinsic parts, developmental, and yet with randomness. Only a metaphysical framework is adequate to meet these ambiguities. In fact, the elements of order and value and develop- ment and meaningful subjectivity in nature are traces of Divinity.42 The wholeness, balance, developmental process, and special dimen- sion of subjectivity to it all are what make belief in God reasonable. What Gilkey is suggesting is that it is possible to be both scientifically empirical and deeply religious in a type of blending. One notes that this is a softer natural theology whose synthesis could be a transitional stage until science catches up with the unknown. Faith here is not blind but a recognition of the harmony of nature's structure. Nature is again an intrinsic part of the larger religious interpretation of life rather than a problem to be addressed by faith from the outside. It is a type of all- inclusive interconnectedness. Writers, likewise, are making a return to religion. The leading figures in movements such as feminism, cultural studies, critical theory, discourse analysis, and deconstruction have begun to reopen negotia- tions with the religious.43 Currently, it represents not going back to traditional faith systems, but rather to work out some kind of synthesis between the secular and sacred ways of seeing.44 Some theorists have begun to look at religion as the "the other," while others seek to take account of "the extraordinary cultural and ideological vitality which re- ligion has given to certain popular social movements.45 Michel Foucault, Jtirgen Habermas, and Jacques Derrida, known for their secular posi- tions, have now turned their attention to religion. Foucault focuses on an "identity or almost so between spirituality and philosophy" and as a salutary connective measure to a modern secular world in which "the relations of oneself to oneself are largely undeveloped."46 Both Habermas and Derrida have shown an interest in the categories of religious experience: uncanniness, undecidability, and the mystical. Habermas claims that religious language is the "bearer of a semantic content that is inspiring and even indispensable, for this content eludes the explanatory force of philosophical language and continues to resist translation into reasoning discourses. Philosophy cannot provide a sub- stitute for consolation."47 Jacques Derrida (like Jan Patocka) argues that the rights of individuals are threatened not only by demonic forms of the sacred but also and equally by those doctrines, such as Platonism and certain forms of secularism, that present themselves as "moments 194 B without mystery." Once mystery has been denied, "it takes very little to envisage an inevitable passage from the democratic to the totalitarian."48 While the narratives of revisionary return written today are a blending of the secular and the sacred (substitute imperfection for perfection, immanence for transcendence, quotidian connection for ascetic sepa- ration as God terms), they nonetheless represent a return to spirituality and are a part of the history of the religious resurgence in our time.</page><page sequence="13">Some might argue that modern thought has no place for the mythologi- cal or the supernatural. I would argue that as "modern thought" pro- gresses to new modes of perception via new metaphysical paradigms, he/she will understand the other side of the coin, that is, the "subjec- tivity" that has been a blank spot for scientists and intellectuals alike. If belief in the supernatural is something immanent in nature but also transcends nature, and whose activity is not bound by the inexorable working of natural law but may progress beyond it through innovation, creation, and self-creation, then man in his new perceptual sensitivity will follow suit to a higher understanding of reality. In searching for a new definition of the sacred with parallel philo- sophical and metaphysical systems, one must look at the past great civi- lizations in their zenith of development. There are two characteristics predominant in the ancient civilizations (e.g., Greek, prior to 500 B.C., and the pre-Columbian Americas): (1) the unity of the universe where all changes arose from the cyclic interplay of opposites and this pair of opposites was seen as unity and (2) respect and a profound understand- ing of nature in its wholeness as a mirror of a larger reality. Current cul- tural information about pre-Columbian civilizations was distorted early by the Spanish invaders of the Americas, whose hegemonic mission as- sured the destruction of the "other's" worldview.49 Censorship and the inquisitorial councils were the tools of distortion for three hundred years. Since then, modern scholarship has largely reiterated the new imposed colonial mythology of the Spanish regarding the native peoples of the Americas. Fortunately, oral history and tradition has kept alive most of the metaphysics of pre-Columbian America.50 In Native American tradition, there were no ideas of finality or fragmentation of the universe. This model is decidedly Western and has its beginnings with the Eleatic school of philosophy circa 500 B.C. After 500 B.C., the universe for Western man/woman no longer pos- sessed the unity of the universe where all changes arose from the cyclic interplay of opposites that was seen as part of that unity. Now there was a personal God standing above all other Gods and directing the world. This led to the separation of spirit and matter, a dualism that is characteristic in Western philosophy.51 For the pre-Columbian mind, none of this personalization and fragmentation existed. Instead, they believed in a basic unity of the universe as well as an awareness of unity, i.e., a mutual interaction of all things. Pre-Columbian men and women, unlike the Western model, were not isolated individual selves. Rather, 3 195 the goal was to transcend the self and identify with ultimate reality. There was no division of nature into separate categories. The pre- Columbian worldview was fluid and had an ever-changing character. It was intrinsically dynamic and contained time and change as essential features. The cosmos for them was one inseparable reality forever in motion, alive, organic, spiritual and material at the same time. Their</page><page sequence="14">worldview was not religious in the traditional sense but metaphysical, and it was based on a high scientific knowledge that was passed to them by other great and civilized contacts.52 Thus, their view of the cosmos was scientific. This is why science (mathematics, astronomy, biology, medicine, agriculture, etc.) and metaphysics for pre-Columbian cultures were in harmony with each other. Their worldview was not linear as it was for Western man. It was cyclical in all of its manifesta- tions to humankind. Even death was not seen as a finality. It was merely a transition to more life. Thus, unlike the Western Judeo-Christian tra- dition, there were no hells, damnations, rewards, or punishments at the end of one's transitory stage called life. The idea is that nothing dies; all is transformed. The pre-Columbian idea of communal organization appears to have existed in all of the native peoples of the Americas prior to the arrival of the Europeans. It was a concept that was in accord with the philosophy and cosmic principles of the Native Americans, whether Maya, Aztec, Lakota, Algonguin, Inca, Toltec, or Hopi, etc. It had a connection to nature and an understanding of her laws. The communal concept in society produces the idea of sharing and not competing. The ideas of competitiveness and individualism have their roots in primitive man. Inherent in them is the idea of survival. The idea of sur- vival was later manifested in aggressive imperialistic societies, best ex- pressed in Roman cultures, the Middle Ages, and, to a degree, modern countries as well. The idea of empire is of Roman/European origin. This led to the idea of conquest, which has its origin in the Middle Ages.53 When the United States established a democratically struc- tured republic, it did not lose many of the European ideas relating to conquest, racism, and exploitation. In the pre-Columbian model, the idea was to establish communal- oriented confederations of many tribal nations in which all goods pro- duced were for all and not the individual. The fact that confederated nations were allowed to have their own elected officials, their own lan- guages and spiritual practices, obviates any possibility of an imperialis- tic and exploitative empire as has been seen in the Western model. The pre-Columbian confederations mark the beginning of nonintervention with the social and governing structures of the confederated nations.54 It began on the local level with the Kalpultin (family units working to- gether), which was autonomous, autarkic, and self-determining, and 196 3 progressed in the same manner to the regional and national levels. This follows another universal principle that relates to their idea of humani- ty, best expressed with the Maya In Lakesh and the Aztec Tloke-Nauake, which projects the harmonious bond of all humankind: In Lakesh (you are my other self) and Tloke-Nauake (Tloke, close; Nauake, together), ex- press the idea of humanity close together, bonded like the fingers in our hands. The allusion to the hand is at the sociocultural level. In Aztec</page><page sequence="15">metaphysics, Tloke-Nauake is a primordial force that "has all the cosmic power within" and, with reference to humankind on this planet, is the force that bonds all humanity.55 Because pre-Columbian men/women understood their ties with their fellow men/women and understood that all living things within nature are sacred, they developed a society that communally shared the fruits of Mother Earth and man's artistic and creative expressions in society. While there was immediate owner- ship of clothes, house, lot, and tools, ownership of Mother Earth was unthinkable. Thus, it was not right to own land, people, or animals. All beings on earth are linked to one another, and they must share and live harmoniously. Consequently, any reference to private property, eco- nomic exploitation, tribute, slavery, usurpation of lands, economic and social classes based on economy and power are characteristics of the Western paradigm and are totally inappropriate in the pre-Columbian world. The inherited knowledge and wisdom in astronomy, mathemat- ics, botany, engineering, etc., gave the pre-Columbian cultures a scien- tific understanding of the universe. Rather than the simplistic anthro- pomorphic mythology created by ignorant clerics in which there is a recreation of the Christian paradigm, they revealed through linguistic and cosmological analysis hidden messages about creation.56 Tepeu, Gucumatz, and Huracan are symbols for the elements that produce mat- ter. Hunab-Ku is the creator of measurement and movement through which this force gives form and energy. It is asserted that all things have a spirit/energy because all things have form. Thus, the Mayas in the Popol-Vuh established a scientific base for their understanding of life, i.e., there is not a cell or a molecule that is not subject to the geo- metric forms maintained within the mold of energy. In Mayan cosmolo- gy, the Creator is represented by a circle and within it a square from which man is a synthesis, who thinks, creates, and does as his Creator, the Supreme Architect whose mental energy gives form. This Mayan philosophy, like other pre-Columbian civilizations of the Americas, is based on geometry, numbers, and mathematics. It was understood that the creative forces, humans, and numbers are one and the same.57 Pre-Columbian man/woman was one with nature; never did he/ &gt; she go against or try to dominate nature. Chief Seattle expressed this connection: "This we know. All things are connected. Whatever befalls the Earth befalls the sons of the Earth. Man did not weave the web of life; he is merely a strand in it. Whatever he does to the web, he does to himself."58 3 197 Western man's conflict with nature originates in part with the Judeo-Christian idea of the creation and Adam and Eve. Here the forces of nature are presented as part of the conflict. In Greek mythology we see Prometheus stealing fire from the gods, confirming the idea that nature is the enemy of humankind. As man/woman suffers encounters with the diabolical forces of nature, the spirit of man/woman becomes</page><page sequence="16">impersonal, as man/woman has to live side by side with the malefic spir- its of nature. Thus, Western man in his historical, religious, and philo- sophical development declares the need to separate totally from nature. A person in pre-Columbian society was not seen for his external self-appearance, position, family-but rather for his intrinsic worth. The respect for others produced a refined attitude of courtesy and re- spect. A person was expected to develop his spirit (In Yollotl) and mind (In Ixtli) to the highest level through a sophisticated educational sys- tem via elevated guides and sages.59 The many symbolic stone images were not representation of gods as in the Greek mythological pan- theon or the numerous Spanish saints and virgins. There was the one great force generally known as Teotl, but specifically Zenteotl, to desig- nate its oneness. This was known by North American natives as the Great Spirit, or Manitou. The One Force, or Great Spirit, gave rise to Teyokoyalitzli, or creation, which was followed by the galactic universe, or Mixkoatl, which in turn gave Zitlatonak, or the brilliant space of stars in the daylight, and Zitlakuey, or the nocturnal light "of the skirt" of stars. Next was the life-giving force to our planet, Tonaketekuhtli, that con- tributes its life-giving energy to the duality within nature, i.e., Tonatehy and Tonaziuautli, which established the place of duality, or Omeyokan. From this duality within nature (as a manifestation of the Supreme Energy Force), it projects, in turn, different aspects of energy through Ketzakoatl, Tezkalipoka, and Uizilopochitl, which represent the forces of in- telligence, memory, and will, respectively. All of these and many more manifestations are linked to the natural order of the universe, which emanate from the One Ultimate Force. They are not gods, as the su- perstitious Spanish thought, but a scientific understanding of the en- ergy forces that make up the universe. The energy flux of Teotl or Zenteotl (the One Supreme Force) is what constitutes the spirit/energy (Tonalli) in all living things, Tetona (humans) and Tlatonal (beasts and plants).60 Unlike the Christians, the pre-Columbian cultures did not have the concept of Satan or hell. Miktlan, mistaken for hell by friars whose reality was filled with hells, demons, and damnations, was merely an appropriate energy dimension for the corresponding energy/spirit form. Absent also was the idea of suffering and punishment after death. Humankind was taught positive principles for guidance in this life. There was no word for evil. There was only a word for goodness or correctness. If you lacked it, then it was expressed as a state without 198 3 correctness. There was no need for a confessor or intermediaries as in Roman Christianity. Each person was taught to integrate into the natu- ral forces, to reach a higher dimension of consciousness so that he or z she could have clarity and wisdom and in so doing be in harmony with the all in a balanced and actualized state. An Ikni was a person who had strayed from the harmonious path and needed guidance by the elevated guides or Tlamatinimeh. There was a constant preoccupation to under-</page><page sequence="17">stand and to connect in order to "elaborate the conceptualization and the deeply poetic nature of the world, man and the divinity.... [T]here was an earnest zeal to find the root and foundation, the truth of humani- ty and to speak the words of truth."61 One way was through art and po- etry expressed in national congregations known as In Xochitl, In Kuikatl, literally meaning flower and song, but metaphorically meaning elevat- ed poetry and hidden expression. With symbol and metaphor men and women could project themselves to a higher dimension using their In Ixtli (mind) and In Yollotl (spirit) to reach an inner and intuitive experi- ence. The goal was to seek Neltiliztli (the root and foundation of things) to find truth. It was not the contemplation of the Greeks, but a deeper, internal possession of the inner roots of being in order to reach a high- er level of consciousness and Yolteotl (an enlightened mind). Thus, the poet, artist, philosopher, or architect sought a new, cosmic, creative dimension where universal symbols reign, which carry the root and foundation of life. In pre-Columbian society, one cannot separate government and economics from education, philosophy, and metaphysics. Each was in- terrelated, and each received its orientation from one nonconflicting source. There was a positive and harmonious way of living and dealing with one another that had its base in philosophy and metaphysics, which in turn provided viability to the governing structures of society. In this system materialism was eliminated because money was non- existent. This prevented materialistic hoarding and monopolies, greed and exploitation, theft and crime. A quality life was more important. A person was highly esteemed if he or she demonstrated an elevated con- sciousness and a fine ethical character. Through various councils, a po- tential leader or head, whether at the local, regional, or national level, needed to have an impeccable record. Elections of these leaders ne- cessitated a vote by unanimous choice. Elections and professions were based on skill and organization. In this manner, they eliminated a hier- archy of class based on money, power, or elitism. Goods were exchanged at the three levels, while harvests were distributed equally to all fami- lies with the excess going to storage for times of need. Because capitalism and profit were nonexistent, and there was no ownership of the national, regional, and local harvests, no minted money or paid labor, one cannot apply Western theories of capitalism and Marxist socialism. One can apply the latter only to the postconquest native society, which had been ruptured at its core by the Spanish and 199 which had been made into a neofeudal society. Nationalism was elimi- nated by the use of autarkic and self-determining confederations of tribal nations. Among the people it was taught that all were one people who were bonded in brotherhood by the force that binds humanity, Tloke-Nauake. Each person was the other's self. To work communally, as opposed to competitively, was a philosophical ethic as well as a</page><page sequence="18">responsibility. Their form of government was a decentralized and demo- cratic electing system that was bipersonal, i.e., two heads at each of the three levels with the corresponding councils of elected officials. This followed the natural pattern of nature and life, the duality in all things. Their two functions were administrative and diplomatic, respectively.62 Women were not in conflict or in competition with men. In fact, they had complete economic and governing control on all matters con- cerned with women by having their own councils and elected heads. Because the justice system was highly developed at all levels, a woman could initiate, for example, a divorce if it were necessary. The concept of total control of women's affairs by women is a revolutionary idea and perhaps futuristic. The aforementioned sketch of the great pre-Columbian socie- ties may seem utopian to the general reader. It is all a matter of how one looks at the world. To the pre-Columbian high cultures, it was not utopian but natural. They were following the natural order based on centuries of scientific study in astronomy, mathematics, philoso- phy, botany, medicine, and metaphysics. To the Native American all life is sacred, whether animals, rivers, or mountains. Perhaps modern man, his sensitivity blunted by centuries of aggression, competitive- ness, and materialism, has lost sight of the essential qualities of life. This is perhaps the central problem of modern man. It is materialism that has secularized his world and his religion. Christianity lost its transcendent qualities when it became institutionalized and secu- larized by Constantine. The Master, called the Christic One, did not intend the Christian communal society to become materialistic or cen- tralized. The larger transcendental and symbolic features of "primi- tive Christianity" were diluted to a human and anthropomorphic level.63 Are church laws established by humans sacred? I think not. The sacred texts of the Bible, Koran, and Torah have interpretive and linguistic problems as well as the problem of the human element. As man looks ahead at the next stage in the sociophilosophical evolu- tion, he and she must create a system akin to the pre-Columbian &gt; model in order to eliminate the problems of greed, exploitation, crime, corruption, racism, and the destruction of the environment. V They must strive for a higher standard and quality of life that is quali- tative instead of quantitative. The creation of an economic system that does not create inequities or corruption is needed. Politics and 200 3 the political animal must be eliminated. Money and power is at the o core of the problem. It has been predicted that in the future money will become nonexistent as we move further into the high-tech revo- lution of computers. Corruption today at all institutional levels is an ominous sign of the times that calls for a complete change and transformation.</page><page sequence="19">Perhaps, upon the completion of this future transformation, the "sacred" may be construed as * being at peace with oneself and loving one another (instead of warring); * protecting the Earth and the environment (instead of polluting); * sharing one's bounty (instead of exploiting); * working for the good of the community (instead of the self); * acquiring higher levels of consciousness (instead of living in the material world); * respecting women, for they are sacred as part of crea- tion (instead of discriminating and abusing them); * dissolving the ego that blinds (instead of arrogance and presumptuousness); * making a bond with all living things (instead of de- stroying and disrespecting life); * developing a positive philosophical framework for living (instead of living with fears, suffering, and damnations of religions); * having a national metaphysical and philosophical sys- tem that is grounded in universal truths (instead of an economic and political system that breeds inequity, greed, power, and corruption); * understanding the link of all humanity in the form of brotherhood and sisterhood (instead of social/economic classes that create racism); * connecting to a higher source, knowing the only temple is within you (instead of relying on intermedi- aries, dogmas, or doctrine); * being in harmony with all things, people, and situations (instead of creating power plays, sensationalizing an event, or bringing attention to oneself); &gt; * understanding the power of the mind in relation to mat- ter or cellular/atomic activity; w * confederating with the world community (instead of sustaining a nationalistic hawk-like stance in world affairs); and B 201 * creating an economic system that is decentralized, with a power base from the bottom up that shares the wealth equally (instead of the exploitative capitalism of today that creates the homeless, economic inequities, minori- ties, exclusionary classes, and racism).</page><page sequence="20">Recent books dealing with trends have focused on the probable next century.64 Much of what has been outlined in this work as pre- Columbian society and philosophy is very much in line with the trends predicted for the next millennial transformation.65 Perhaps, in another thirty or forty years, we will look back in astonishment at our primitive and barbaric twentieth century. It is at this moment that we will recog- nize the sacred because we will realize it as a universal truth.

Its beginning, at the height of Christian civilization in the twelfth century, seems to be con- nected with the fact that Chris- tianity makes a sharper distinction than other faiths between the sacred and the secular.

There is, and has been since the 1500s, a live and rich oral tradition that fol- lowed the dictate of Kuautemok to preserve the culture and language. Unfortunately, Spanish American academics as well as American have not properly recognized this oral history. Recent German scholars have taken the lead, fol- lowing many of the ideas of the oral history, and are proving the wholesale distortion and falsity of post-Conquest documents written by the Spanish on pre-Columbian cultures, e.g., human sacrifice. 51 Arnoldo Carlos Vento and Daniel Estrada, "Lucha: The History, Cul- ture, and Politics of the Mexican and the Chicano," unpublished book manuscript, chapter 2. 52 There are several theories regard- ing the acquisition of knowledge by the great cultural and scientific societies (Teotihuakan, Toltek, Maya, Aztec, Inca): (1) Knowl- edge was passed on progressively from previous high cultures, e.g., Teotihuakan to Toltek, Toltek to u 0 N ,&lt; U 204 3 U z a.</page><page sequence="23">N O T E S Aztekah. (2) The knowledge ap- pears to be present at a very early stage, e.g., the knowledge of zero was present in pre-Mayan cultures in Mesoamerica, antedating the West by almost one thousand years. What was its origin? Some have conjectured (and with some reason) that there existed a very high culture in a prehistoric land- mass in the Caribbean area before it disappeared due to a cataclysmic occurrence. This was known as Aztlan in the Aztec oral and writ- ten history. (3) In the folk legends of the Maya, there are references to "visitors from the sky" and, as such, the idea of extraterrestrial contact. In esoteric literature, however, there are references to what are now hot weather bal- loons that existed in the time of Aztlan. This would explain con- tact from the sky and from an ad- vanced civilization. 53 Arnoldo Carlos Vento, Tres civiliza- ciones del mundo medieval (Lewiston: Edwin Mellen Press, 1998), 87-93.

Education was mandatory in the Confedera- tion of Anuauk. Illiteracy was nonexistent. In the initial stages, the parents had the responsibility of assisting in the educational process, e.g. the Kuikalli or kinder- garten that was part of the Peukalli or elementary grades. This was followed by the Ichpochkalli (girls) and the Telpochkalli (boys) equiva- lent to high school and college. The highest level was reserved for the very gifted, the Teyokalli, where one learned the most pro- found thought. There were two types of Aztec Nahuatl (lan- guages), one for everyday use and an elevated one for diplomacy, poetry, philosophy, etc.; likewise, there were two types of mathe- matics, one for everyday use and the other for complicated engi- neering. The gifted student learned the higher-level language and mathematics at the Teyokalli. 60 This information is credited, to a great extent, to Yakanini Meztli Kuautemok (Dr. Juan Luna Cardenas), a native and scholar whose knowledge was passed on through generations of his Meztli (Moon) clan. 61 Miguel Leon Portilla, Aztec Thought and Culture (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1963), 79. 62 Maria del Carmen Nieva, Mexicayotl: Esencia del Mexicano (Mexico: Editorial Ori6n, 1969), 137-51. 63 Arnoldo Carlos Vento, En el nombre del Padre y del Hijo (Mexico: Editorial Mascarones, 1999), 279-86. 64 Gerald Celente, Trends 2000 (New York: Warner Books, 1998). 65 This is also in line with prophetic visions shared by various cultures around the world (Maya, Aztec, Hopi, and Tibetan). Essentially, it calls for a return to the universal and eternal values of the ancients, i.e., the philosophy and cosmolo- gy of the Native American that calls for a harmonious, nonmateri- alistic, nonexploitative, sharing community that is both highly spiritual and metaphysically scientific. &lt; 3: tu -C VI&gt; 0 N &lt; U 14 205 o o o 0 Z 0: z CC CL Ln</page></plain_text>
