<plain_text><page sequence="1">Man in the Landscape - A Historic View of Aesthetics of Nature , by Paul Shephard, foreword by Michael M. McCarthy, 2nd edi- tion. College Station: Texas A&amp;M Press, 1991.290 pp. As Michael Martin McCarthy has pointed out in his foreword to Man in the Landscape , the book contains a rich vein of ideas that can be successively mined with repeated readings.

There is an angry clarity to Shephard' s views which are damning not only toward corporate greed but also what goes in the name of na- ture appreciation. He is most vitriolic in his condemnation of pastoralism and its role in the destruction of biodiversity of the earth. As he points out, affinity for this kind of landscape is equated with moral values which distinguish humanized from the wild and equate that with good from the evil. The forest and the desert have represented disorder and chaos, the struggle against which is exis- tential more than anything else in this age. The aesthetic appreciation of natural scenery is yet another blinker which obfuscates the true understanding of nature's myriad aspects. The roots of tourism in the pictorial arts (Shephard traces even further back to pilgrimage to sacred relics) have resulted in the media-dominated post industrial age and its homogeneous landscapes. Shephard is not unaware of the ambivalence that characterizes the Western attitude. The sublime experiences evoked by nature (akin to the numinous feeling so well described by Rudolf Otto in The Idea of the Holy) has played not a small part in the preservation of wilderness in North America, an aberration in this tale of aesthetic appreciation reserved only for a tamed, controlled version of nature. Our very experience of the environment, in which vision plays such an important role, is conditioned by our evolution in the tropical forest. The innate search for regularity and order, which the Gestalt psychologists so ably demonstrated, is derived not only from the image of the human body but also lies in the way it has adapted to the terrain over millen- nia. Shephard has concentrated on the eye in chronicling this adaptation - one wishes for a similar treatment of the other senses, which more recent authors (such as Diane Ackerman in her popular The Natural History of the Sen- ses) have begun to turn their attention to. The theme of vision and the role that has played in the distancing of mankind from the environ- ment has been subsequently taken up in greater detail by Yi-Fu Tuan in Segmented Worlds and the Self Shephard has brought a psychoanalytic slant to his evolutionary and ecological framework by pointing out that the psyche adapts to the environment as much as the body does and stores its images which furnish the raw material for the symbols of archetypes. The desert and the cave afford extraordinary sen- sory experiences, akin to hallucinatory effects, which reappear in our dream motifs and art. The landscape furnishes the setting for sacred places, forming a prototype for religious ar- chitecture. The book contains gems of in- sights like: "The classical is a broad sweep from whose general concepts the details are deducted; while northern Gothic thought laboriously pieces together generalizations from endless minute observations." Shephard relates these styles of art to aspects of landscapes in which they are nurtured in a most interesting way. His observations on the garden were perhaps the first in what now forms a distinguished body of work. "The Image of the Garden" is a rich chapter delving into eroticism and pleasure, notions of paradise and after life. In wide ranging ex- amples, Shephard shows how each of them typified the idealized view of nature and con- ceptions of beautiful, sublime, and the pic- turesque held by that particular society. A most interesting thesis is that in patriarchal cultures, where the earth in the form of the mother goddess is devalued, the garden with its grotto becomes a vestigial symbol of ear- lier veneration and the feminine reduced to a passive cow in a meadow/pastoral setting. Many of these themes have been developed in a recent collection on Meaning of the Garden. Shephard never loses sight of the continuity between animals and human beings - both biological and social. His discussion of the territorial instinct in the chapter of "Sense of</page><page sequence="3">Journal of Architectural and Planning Research 12:4 (Winter, 1995) 408 Place" underscores the commonality though he does not address distinctions like con- sciousness and language acquisition which are behind much of the debate in ethology. Shepharďs advocacy of hunting is not so star- tling when we remember that it is limited to a ritualistic gesture, an avowal of the animal's majestic prowess. It loses its ritualistic aspect when it becomes a sport for its own sake, leading to spurious bloodletting and extinc- tion. Shephard rails against anthropomorphization of the natural world including animals, as being in the way toward a deeper apprecia- tion. But this view is contrary to eons of ex- perience of and adaptation to the surroundings through our bodies. Human feelings including empathy which play an important role in the anthropomorphic construct of the world are inevitable. Such a construct may not always be destructive - for example in Hinduism, it has resulted in a benign attitude toward na- ture. A historic look at the esthetics of nature should point at evolving new views. The old aesthetic was a negation of what had been considered disordered, ugly, and profane. The picturesque landscape in its bucolic arrange- ment of peaceful looking hills and valleys is an antithesis of chaos. Even the landscape of the American West was read as ruins to which the Western eye had been acclimatized in its Grand Tours. The growing popularity of ecol- ogy will perhaps shake us out of the aesthetics of geometry and soft curves, of controlled order and cute naturalism. Perhaps the only shortcoming, if any, in the book is that it has confined itself to the study of the West only, even though implicit in the writing is an understanding of how Eastern cultures have related to nature. Shephard, I suspect, has drawn upon this comparison to damn the Judeo-Christian ethic. One wishes, however for a more explicit and direct treat- ment. Many of Shephard's pronouncements of a quarter of a century ago are now being em- pirically tested and will continue to stimulate research in the various fields of physical and social sciences as well as humanities. This book will remain a landmark in scholarship on nature as a cultural artifact. REFERENCES Ackerman D (1991) A natural history of the senses. New York: Vintage Books. Hester R (Ed.)
