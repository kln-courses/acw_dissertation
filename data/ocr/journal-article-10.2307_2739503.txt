<plain_text><page sequence="1">Social Organization of Subhuman Primates in Their Natural Habitat by Kinji Imanishi INTRODUCTION IN THIS PAPER I shall review some studies of subhuman primates hitherto undertaken in their natural habitat. I shall not mention the many important studies done in laboratories, zoos, or under similar conditions of captivity. Further, as studies of subhuman primates undertaken in their natural habitat are of too wide a scope and include topics too divergent to be reviewed in this limited space, I shall focus my attention on the social organization of such subhuman primates. Ac- cordingly, I do not describe work done on such topics as food habits, nesting habits, mating habits, terri- toriality, nomadism, and vocal communication, when it does not concern those problems in social organiza- tion that are of interest here. Finally, I shall deal only with certain central problems in the social organiza- tion of subhuman primates, namely, the question of KINJI IMANISHI is Professor of Social Anthropology in the Re- search Institute of Humanistic Science, Kyoto University (Kyoto, Japan). He was born in 1902, and received the D.Sc. degree from Kyoto University in 1940. His long-term field of research is ecology and the sociology of plants, animals, and man, and he is now focusing on problems in the social evolu- tion of primates. As a researcher and explorer, IMANISHI has led many expeditions: among others, to Micronesia in 1941, to the Great Khingan in 1942, to Inner Mongolia in 1944, to Nepal in 1952, to Karakoram in 1955, and to tropical Africa in 1958. He has published numerous books and articles, mostly in Japanese. The present paper was submitted to CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY on May 26, 1959. and was sent for CA* treatment on July 20, 1959, to seven scholars, of whom the following (plus one who prefers to remain anonymous) responded with comments: A. H. Schultz, H. Harlow, A. Kortlandt, and S. L. Washburn. The comments were sent to the author, who then revised the paper. The revised manuscript was, in mid-April, 1960, again sent out for CA* treatment, to four of the original commentators, as well as to ten other scholars from whom comments had not been solicited in the first instance. In response to the second mailing, comments were received from Francois Bourliere, C. R. Carpenter, M. R. A. Chance, John T. Emlen, Jr., Adolph H. Schultz, S. L. Washburn and Irven DeVore, and Sir Sollie Zuckerman. These comments are reproduced in full at the end of the paper, the references cited by commentators being inter- alphabetized with the author's bibliography but distinguished by the initials of the appropriate commentator. Following the comments is a reply from the author to those comments re- ceived in time for the preparation of such a reply. Because A. Kortlandt was traveling in Africa, he was regrettably not avail- able for comment on the final version of the manuscript. a breeding season, the delineation and definition of the minimum social unit, and some features of the internal organization of such units. Throughout the paper, the focus is on developing theory in the study of the social organization of subhuman primates in their natural habitat. In connection with theoretical developments, I must draw attention to the progress of method. For long after the days of Darwin, but one simple method was in use. The researcher entered the natural habitat, searched for his animals, and recorded his experiences. This may be called the "naturalistic" approach. Even eminently competent laboratory experimentalists had no more sophisticated method in the field. Field studies done by Zuckerman (1932), Bingham (1932), and Nissen (1931), as also the early works of Carpenter (1934, 1935, 1940), were based on this classical method. In the early 1940's, Carpenter (1942a) tattooed num- bers on many rhesus monkeys, released them on San- tiago Island, Puerto Rico, and observed them on the basis of individual identification. This "intensive" method of observing identified individuals, which had already been in use among ornithologists, has brought a great advance in the field study of subhuman pri- mates. For instance, the existence of dominance hier- archy, which had been recognized among subhuman primates under captive conditions, could for the first time be confirmed in the field by means of this method. Carpenter's study of rhesus monkeys, Macaca mulatta, was succeeded by the study of Japanese monkeys, Macaca fuscata, in Japan. The study of Japanese monkeys was begun in 1949 ac- cording to the naturalistic approach. Since 1952, it has been carried on according to the intensive method of identifying individuals, not, however, by means of marking, but by means of regularly setting out food to ittract wild monkeys to come near by. This process, called provisionization, has been described by Itani (1954), Imanishi (1957a), and Frisch (1959). Provi- ;ionized monkeys are, in a sense, acculturated monkeys, in that provisionization means not only a change in ;heir food habits but also a change in their social be- ,avior and personalities through the contact with man. But they are not captured or domesticated monkeys, Fhey are as wild as ever. exceDting7 as visiting the feed- Vol. 1 *Nos. 5-6- Sept.-Nov. 1960 393</page><page sequence="2">ing place almost every day partially modifies their tradi- tional routes of nomadism. In due course of time, their behavior may come to change considerably, as monkeys born before provisionization gradually die out and are replaced by monkeys born after provisionization and accustomed to man from their childhood. Indeed, as young monkeys which do not fear man and take food directly from man's hand are in fact increasing, pro- visionization may be a step towards domestication. As Frisch has pointed out (1959), caution on this point is advisable in considering the Japanese studies. With the introduction of this particular intensive method in the study of Japanese monkeys, another change from historically common research procedure has also been effected. This is the change from short- term observation to long-term observation. For instance, day-to-day records of observation on the monkeys of Takasakiyama, which were provisionized in 1953, have been accumulated by three successive observers con- tinuously over seven years. There is no other example of so long a period of observation of one group of mon- keys belonging to one species. And these observations should be continued. Long-term day-to-day observation is now becoming as essential a procedure in studying societies of subhuman primates as it is in meteorology or astronomy. Where the day-to-day observation of the Japanese monkeys cannot be practiced, observation of at least two or three weeks a year has been carried out. Such year-to-year records of observation are kept for the monkeys of Koshima, Minoo, Shodoshima, and Arashi- yama. Individual monkeys of these localities have been named, and the periodic observations are designed to check up on their respective social statuses, sexual ac- tivities, and so on. Long-term observation may be the only possible method for intensive survey of societies of subhuman primates, for which neither interviews nor documents can be used by researchers. If in the following sections of this paper I describe a few new studies of Japanese monkeys somewhat fully, this is not meant to underestimate other studies car- ried out mostly by the naturalistic approach. It is be- cause the intensive method outlined above has already produced very important results concerning social or- ganization, and thus may be of special interest. The study of societies of subhuman primates will advance rapidly if this method is applied by many more field researchers and to various subhuman primates other than Japanese monkeys. PROBLEMS BREEDING SEASON Some thirty years ago there was no reliable report of systematic observations on the social life of monkeys or apes in their natural habitat, but only anecdotal or fragmental information collected mostly by hunters and travellers. Zuckerman was one of the pioneers in recognizing the urgent necessity for more accurate knowledge on the natural life of these animals. He com- piled data of a kind thitherto unknown, and paved the way of a new scientific approach to the study of sub- human primates. Although most of his observations were carried out in zoos, he did also study the natural life of wild chacma baboons, Papio comatus, in South Africa. Zuckerman was the first person to try to formulate a scientific hypothesis as to the foundation of primate society. This hypothesis was based on considerations of reproductive physiology. On the 4th of May, 1930, he succeeded in collecting twelve adult females from one troop of wild chacma baboons. He wrote (1932: 50): The females shot on May 4th were representative of practi- cally all stages of the complete cycle. Some were non-pregnant. Some were in the early stages of pregnancy, and one con- tained a fullterm foetus. Others again, were lactating, and one of these, judging by the age of her baby, would soon have restarted her normal menstrual cycles. This disparity between the different females proves conclusively that female Chacma baboons become pregnant at all times of the year in the neighbourhood of Grahamstown. On the basis of this knowledge obtained by himself about the breeding of wild chacma baboons, Zucker- man developed his principle of primate sociology as follows (1932: 313): The factors underlying associations of monkeys and apes are characterized by their continuous, rather than intermit- tent, sexual nature. The male primate is always sexually potent, while the female is also always to some extent re- ceptive. In the lower mammal, on the other hand, the female, as a rule, accepts the male only during isolated periods of heat, and this intermittent character of the sexual bond is reflected in the transitory nature of their social unions. In short, he considered that the factor underlying the permanent association of the sexes was their uninter- rupted reproductive life. Carpenter seems to support Zuckerman's hypothesis to some extent when he says (1942b: 196): Available facts for most monkeys and apes indicate that they do not have discrete breeding seasons, although the rate of reproduction may vary from season to season. Sexual activity takes place throughout the year in chimpanzees, gibbons, rhesus; monkeys, baboon, howler and spider monkeys. The males usually have a succession of estrous fe- males with which they copulate repeatedly during the fe- males' limited estrous periods.-It would seem reasonable to suppose that the relative constancy of primate groups is im- portantly related during all seasons to the incidence of sexual behavior. It was the merit of Haddow to prove that there is a breeding season in redtail monkeys of East Africa, Cercopithecus ascanius schmidti. His data derived not from direct observation in the field but from analysis of a total sample of 47 mature females shot by him. With respect to these, he confirmed the number of females in early pregnancy, and that in advanced preg- nancy in each month. He further referred to the record of five living females with infants. Of the results, he wrote (1952: 304): It is admitted that the sample is a small one, but these results are so suggestive that it is hard to escape the con- clusion that in the case of C.a. schmidti there appears to be at least a preferential breeding-season. Thus, taking the time- estimates given above for pregnancy and lactation, it will be 394 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="3">Imanishi: PRIMATE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION seen that they are consistent with a preferential breeding- season lasting, approximately, from December till April. Referring to a marked seasonal variation in birth rate in a colony of rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) in the Carnegie Institute at Baltimore, which was reported by Hartman (1931) and reviewed by Zuckerman (1932) as not conclusive, Haddow (1952) enumerated the dates of forty births recorded for rhesus monkeys in the Virus Research Institute, Entebbe, Uganda, and suggested that, in this case also, there might be recognizable a preferential breeding season. In both cases the monkeys were kept in captivity, and, so far as I am aware, it has not yet been confirmed that there is a breeding season among rhesus monkeys in nature. Among Japanese monkeys, however, which belong to the same genus Macaca as rhesus monkeys, a definite breeding season has been recognized during observations in the field. The breeding season of Japanese monkeys concen- trates in the winter, though the female maintains a regular menstrual cycle of 28 days throughout the year, as observed by Hazama (1954). In Takasakiyama, copu- lations have regularly occurred from October to April during the last seven years, except for a few anomalies. Accordingly, births there have been observed to occur from May to September of each year (Table 1).1 The TABLE 1 INCIDENCE OF COPULATION AND BIRTH IN THE OIKIA OF TAKASAKIYAMA FROM OCTOBER 1954 TO DECEMBER 1955 (AFTER UNPUBLISHED DATA RECORDED BY ITANI) Year Month Copulationt Birtht 1954 October * it November * * it December 1955 January February March ** April * May A * June A July August A September A * October A November ** December t *** frequent ** not frequent * rare A masturbation, consort relationship, and sexual display, but not true copulation monkeys under observation at the other localities in Japan reveal the same tendencies. It may be worth men- tioning that during the non-breeding season males can never be found mounting females in Takasakiyama. Japanese monkeys live up to the northern limit of distribution of all subhuman primates. One might think that if they lived in the tropics instead of in the temperate climate of Japan, they would have no breed- ing season. However, as already mentioned, there are monkeys, like redtails, which have a breeding season although they live in tropical Africa. On the other hand, Haddow could not find a breeding season in Colobus abyssinicus, another tropical African monkey. It is as yet premature to generalize about breeding season in subhuman primates because there are only a few species the reproductive life of which has been thoroughly surveyed under natural conditions. From our present knowledge, it is safe to say that, though chacma baboons have no breeding season, hamadryas baboons, Papio hamadryas (cf. Zuckerman 1932: 56), may have one, and that, though Japanese monkeys have a breeding season, rhesus monkeys may not have one. As to social organization, it is clear that the factor underlying associations of subhuman primates cannot be sexual relationship alone, as Zuckerman stated, since among monkeys which have a definite breeding season there is no loosening of solidarity during the non- breeding season. As Carpenter said several years ago (1942b: 198): To conclude, however, that sexuality is the only enduring basis of these societies would be to over-simplify the complex facts. For long periods of time in free ranging primate groups, no primary sexual behavior can be observed, yet neither the group pattern nor size change but these persist and the group remains a coherent social unit. THE OIKIA Zuckerman's second principle of primate sociology, as important as his first, is that families including both sexes are the fundamental units of primate societies. Thus Zuckerman wrote (1932: 314-15): The nucleus of the societies of monkeys and apes is the family party, consisting of an overlord and his harem, held together primarily by the interest of the male in his females and by their interest in their young. Paternal interest is not strongly manifested by sub-human primates, and in this they doubtless show resemblances to the behaviour of the lower mammals. But the family of the primate differs from that of the lower mammal, since one of its essential members is the overlord. The male of most lower mammals separates from his females after his rutting season is past, so that the family in his species is formed by the female and her young. A conspicuous characteristic of the harem system and the system of dominance in the primates is the absence of all but clandestine promiscuity. And in this again the primate dif- fers from many lower mammals. The harem forms the nucleus when several family parties unite to form a larger herd, but the herd never appears to be so stable a unit as the family, which never loses its identity within the larger group. This generalization of Zuckerman's, from his observa- tions of chacma baboons, is accepted by anthropolo- gists as the standard theory. In this connection, it is worth mentioning that Bolwig, in a recently published paper on the same baboons (1959), says he was not able to discern clearly either harem or family in the bands observed by him in Rhodesia. However, careful ob- servations, though without individual identification, made by Lumsden (1951), Buxton (1952), and Haddow :In the beginning of 1955, the population of the oikia (for definition of this term, see p. 397 of Takasakiyama was as follows: leaders 6, subleaders 10, peripheral males 50, male infants 60 total number of males 126; females 135, female infants 60, total number of females 195; total number of males and females 321. Of the 135 females, 100-115 were sexually mature. Total number of births in 1955 was 59 (male 30, female 28, uncertain 1). These numbers were all recorded by J. Itani.

The group's chief interest revolved around studies in ecology and social be- havior. A few years later, an Experimental Animal Research Committee was formed at Tokyo University, whose main con- cern was the experimental use of monkeys for medical re- search. Cooperation developed between the two groups and eventually, in 1956, brought about the formation of the Japan Monkey Center. This organization includes at present 15 researchers, and its officially published objectives are: (1) To foster team-research on primates. (2) To study intensively the ecology and social structure of populations of Macaca fuscata still living in Japan, and to work out methods for the conservation and propagation of these populations. (3) To establish and operate, in cooperation with several universities, a primate laboratory and to centralize the data obtained by students in these universities. (4) To establish breeding colonies of Japanese monkeys, with a view to supplying the growing demand for ex- perimental animals. (5) To open a primate zoo as a means of studying problems connected with human origins. (6) To publish books and journals on the study of pri- mates. Close-range study of wild-monkey populations, made possible by painstaking provisioning, so far forms the most significant contribution of the Japan Monkey Center to primate research. However, the work of the Center is far from being limited to these ecological and sociological interests. Two breeding colonies have been created. In one case a natural population was captured in its entirety and released on a small island. The other group was artificially formed with monkeys captured one by one in Yakushima. The integration of the new group was achieved in captivity by a method which allowed researchers to observe some of the mechanics of group formation.... Last year, members of the Center organized two field trips, one to central Africa and the other to South-East Asia. Their objective was twofold: first, to examine how primate ecology and social behavior may be studied in these regions and to see to what extent the method of provisioning, so successful in Japan, could be used in a different environment; secondly, to make contacts looking to the importation of several pri- mate species to Japan, either for transplantation in Japanese islands or for building up the primate zoo, which is one of the objectives of the Center. Already three gibbons, 18 crab-eating macaques and six red-faced monkeys have been released on one of the numerous uninhabited islets scattered along the shore of Japan. Although the Center itself has some equipment for physi- ological and anatomical research, most of the laboratory work, especially that connected with medicine, is carried out at the various universities connected with the Center. The results of these studies are collected and made available to all students at the Center. The first issue of a journal of primatology, Primates, ap- peared in 1957. . . . It has been announced that, thanks to a grant of the Rockefeller Foundation, the third and fourth issues would be published entirely in English. It is hoped that this will constitute the first step in creating an international organ for studies in primatology. If the scientific quarterly has suffered from initial dif- ficulties, the same is not true of a lighter magazine, Monkey, addressed to a high-school public. This publication, which has already reached its thirteenth number, maintains a surprisingly high standard. Much of the data concerning the development of the supervised colonies can in fact be found only in this high-school magazine. Excellent photographs, in the best Japanese tradition, illustrate the articles. JOHN E. FRISCH (American Anthropologist 61: 584-85, 592-93) (1952) in Uganda, seem to support the principle of- fered by Zuckerman. The following is a quotation from Haddow's paper (1952: 353): An important observation made by Zuckerman is that P. comatus bands split up into small family parties for the night. At a later date Lumsden, working on the sleeping- habits of monkeys in western Uganda, found that this ob- servation held good for various species belonging to the genera Cercocebus, Cercopithecus, Papio and Colobus, and the present writer has seen a band of ten chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) divide into at least two parties for the night. Lumsden's results showed that in C. albigena johnstoni, C. a. schmidti, P. doguera tessellatus and C. abyssinicus the mean size of resting bands was between four and five individuals, and the figures for other less common species were largely in agreement. Buxton, working on C. a. schmidti in a small forest patch in central Uganda, has found that there the mean size of resting bands is even smaller, being between three and four individuals. On the other hand, bands observed by Lumsden during the day were larger, usually numbering over ten individuals. The largest band of C. a. schmidti reported by Bux- ton was 26. He considered that the probable composi- tion of the normal family group in this species was one male, one or more females, and their young, as was found by Zuckerman among baboons. However, if the family formation were a direct derivative of non- intermittent reproductive activity and male dominance, as Zuckerman assumed, one would not expect to find such family groupings among C. a. schmidti, because in this species not only is the breeding season recog- nizable, as has been mentioned above, but also male dominance is inconspicuous, as both Buxton and Had- dow have pointed out. On the other hand, Carpenter confirms that in groups of howling monkeys, Alouatta palliata (1934), and rhesus monkeys (1942a) there are a number of adult males, and more adult females than adult males, yet they have no breeding season, and there prevails among them a type of rotating mateship-a type of promiscuity. Accordingly, it is clear that Zuckerman's second principle on the family or harem system does not hold good for societies of monkeys and apes in general. What, then, is meant by the term "family"? Carpen- ter (1940) described the group of white-handed gibbons (Hylobates lar) he observed in Thailand as a "family," it being typically composed of an adult and reproduc- ing male and female, and a succession of young ranging in age from early infancy to late juvenility or early adulthood. Previous to Carpenter's study, McCann 396 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="5">Imanishi: PRIMATE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION (1933) had described as a "family" the similar compo- sition of the group of white-browed gibbons (Hylobates hoolock) observed in Assam. In his report (1951) Lums- den might call a "family" the band of six Colobus abyssinicus ituricus, including two juveniles, which was observed by him continuously over three months, if he could confirm the presence of an adult male and three adult females in the band, but he might hesitate to call it a "family" if he found there were two adult males and two adult females in it. When the howling monkeys of Barro Colorado Island were surveyed by Carpenter (1934) in 1933, each clan (or "group," after Carpenter) contained, on the average, three adult males, but when they were surveyed by Collias and Southwick (1952) in 1951, 23 of the 29 clans had simply one adult male, and only six of them had two males; those who did not know the results of-the 1933 census might conclude from the 1951 census that a "family" pattern was predominant among howling monkeys. Reporting his field study of chimpanzees, Nissen said (1931: 18): In six instances I was able to determine that there were at least two mature males present in a group. These observations certainly do not exclude the possibility that a chimpanzee band is composed of a polygamous male and his family, since a male may well have one or more mature sons, but they do lend some probability to alternative explanations. The ex- treme possibility, that neither male nor female chimpanzee is limited to a single mate, even temporarily, has never been satisfactorily disproven, as far as I know. In my opinion, a band in which promiscuity prevails cannot be called a "family" even though the two males in it are a father and his mature son. In other words, we may legitimately consider it a family only if we can establish the absence of incest between this mature son and his mother. It is almost impossible to answer such a requirement without knowing the exact pedigree of each individual which participates in sexual activi- ties in the band. Nevertheless, until such incest is dis- proved, it is appropriate to restrict the use of the term "family" in scientific description of subhuman societies. Here I would like to recommend the word oikia as a technical term2 designating the minimum unit of social life found in any species of animal, regardless of the composition of that unit. Then, with reference to so- cieties of subhuman primates, the clan in howling mon- keys, the family in gibbons, the small nesting party or sleeping group in redtail monkeys, and the harem in chacma baboons, would each be describable as an "oikia." The large daytime band of redtails, or troop of chacma baboons, would be, not an oikia, but an ag- gregate of oikiae. As already mentioned, Carpenter (1942a) did not rec- ognize in rhesus monkeys the harem or family that Zuckerman found in baboons, though macaques are closely related to baboons in physical structure as well as in mode of life. However, though the group among rhesus monkeys is sometimes as large as the troop of baboons, it appears to be a definite and stable social unit and never to lose its identity, so that I regard it as an oikia. This judgment applies equally to the group of bonnet monkeys (Macaca radiata) observed by Nolte (1955) in southern India, and to groups of Japanese monkeys. It is worth noting that there are at least two distinct patterns of organization at the oikia level. In the one pattern, each oikia has its own territory and is antag- onistic to contiguous oikiae, though it may accept a solitary intruder in some cases. Examples are oikiae of howling monkeys, rhesus monkeys, and gibbons. In the other pattern, each oikia associates easily with contig- uous oikiae under normal circumstances, the oikiae to- gether forming a large band or troop. Examples are oikiae of redtail monkeys and chacma baboons. Oikiae which associate to make a large unit seem, however, to live within a certain area. Haddow writes on redtail monkeys as follows (1952: 357): On any given day these will be found divided into smaller groups, but under ordinary circumstances these groups will be limited to the particular area concerned. Under certain stimuli, notably that of a fruiting tree, they will coalesce, and all the Redtails of that particular area will be found banded together temporarily. While the evidence is not conclusive, it is thought that when such very large aggregations do occur they consist of monkeys from a particular area, which may have fairly definite boundaries. It may be said that each oikia of redtail monkeys shares a particular area as a common territory, but, within it, not occupying its own territory and maintaining a neighborhood relationship with the other component oikiae of the band. We have already noted that Haddow (1952: 353) ob- served a band of ten chimpanzees to divide into at least two parties for the night. Donisthorpe, who made a field study of mountain gorillas in 1957, says (1958: 205): It has been suggested that gorilla groups keep to their own territories and resist intrusion by other groups. I saw no signs to support this suggestion. Towards the end of March a group of three and a large group were known to be in the same area, moving in opposite directions. By March 31 they had passed each other within 100 yards. Had there been any antagonism one would have expected the smaller group to retreat. She also says (1958: 216): Large groups sometimes divide and rejoin, but they do not always split into the same component parts. Chimpanzees and gorillas may have tfie same pattern of organization as redtail monkeys. It seems precarious, however, to discuss the organization of a large band or troop without exact knowledge of its component oikia, that is, the minimum social units. INTERNAL ORGANIZATION OF AN OIKIA CLASS AND SUBGROUP Carpenter assumed the existence of "subgroups" within the large group of macaques observed by him, though he did not afford a concrete example of the 2This term was first proposed by the author in 1950. At the same time, he proposed the term specia to designate the maximum social unit, that is, the total society of any species of animal, in- cluding in number all individuals of the species, and covering in extent the whole distribution of the species. Vol. 1 * Nos. 5-6 * Sept.-Nov. 1960 397</page><page sequence="6">organization of such subgroups. For instance, he said (1942b: 188): Let us assume that through various behavioral exchanges, involving avoidance, maturation and learning, two males of a primate group become by degrees strongly antagonistic. At the same time, through reciprocal motivation and affinitive learning, several females with their young are attached to the more dominant male and several females and young likewise attach themselves to the male which has a lower dominant rank. The males will tend to avoid each other, and, while doing so, will carry with them their attached dependents. Then, as the intra-sub-group bonds increase in positive strength and the inter-sub-group relations weaken or increase in antagonistic quality, the sub-grouping relationships change from that of being part of a larger group to a status of an independent new group. The males act like polar bodies in cell division. Altmann (1959) calls "subgroup" the association of a female and its dependent infant in an oikia of howling monkeys, but in this paper I limit discussion of the term "subgroup" to the definition originally advanced by Carpenter. Carpenter also used the term "class," to denote vari- ous sex- and age-groupings within the same large group of macaques. These "classes" had differential functions in the social organization of the oikia: . . . The control of a group is distributed among individuals and classes of individuals in direct proportion to the statuses of individuals or classes of individuals [Carpenter 1954: 274]. It is interesting that, in the course of field studies of Japanese monkeys, class organization and spatial dis- tribution of classes attract the observer's notice earlier than does subgroup organization. This may be due to the fact that class organization is a more basic ingredi- ent of oikian social life than subgroup organization, which stretches over classes. Generalizing from several oikiae intensively observed during recent years, it seems reasonable to recognize at least three main classes in the social organization of Japanese monkeys, namely, (1) central males including leaders and subleaders, (2) peripheral males, and (3) all females together with de- pendent infants. Females may be divided into central females and peripheral females, as in the case of males. But in females the cleavage between the central and the peripheral is not so distinct as in males. In a preceding paper (Imanishi 1957a), I included a schema that showed the spatial distribution of oikions (that is, the individual components of an oikia) after the studies by Itani (1954) of the oikia of Takasaki- yama. Now I can rewrite that as a generalized schema representing spatial distribution of classes in any oikia of Japanese monkeys (Fig. 1). Leaders and subleaders seem to make up separate and discrete classes in such a big oikia as that of Takasaki- yama,3 but in smaller oikiae, where the total number of leaders and subleaders is also small, they may be seen to belong to one class of central males. When Carpenter says of rhesus monkeys that, "Some of the females, usually the more dominant ones, may form a kind of central cluster around the most dominant male but the relationship in such a sub-grouping is easily differentiated from the male-female consort re- lationship formed by an estrous female with a respon- sive male" (1942a: 139), it is evident that this subgroup derives from an intimate relation between a central male and some central females based on their common spatial occupancy in an oikia. Furuya, who studied such subgroups of Japanese monkeys in the oikia of Taka- sakiyama by analyzing grooming relations among oikions, has reported (1957) that some leaders of the oikia make more or less definite subgroups with at- tendant females. One of the reasons why such subgroups FIG. 1.

DOMINANCE RANK One factor supporting the integration of an oikia is the dominance rank or dominance hierarchy settled upon and sanctioned among oikions. From his observa- tion of rhesus monkeys Carpenter has said (1942b: 194): Usually, several group males which are arranged in a domi- nance hierarchy are competitive in some situations and with certain degrees of motivation, while the same animals may closely coordinate their behavior in other situations with dif- Ferent degrees of motivation. For example, the male despot of Ri rhesus monkey group will exclusively possess a tray of food 3In the oikia of Takasakiyama, difference in social status be- tween leaders and subleaders is distinguishable as follows: when leaders are in the central part together with females, infants, and babies, subleaders cannot enter there, though they usually situate near the central part. When leaders retire to the mountain but some females, infants, and babies remain at the central part, sub- leaders at once enter there and take the leaders' role; females which chase intruding subleaders when leaders are present then tolerate the presence of subleaders. As for age difference, leaders of the oikia are estimated to be over twenty-five years old, while subleaders are estimated to be around twenty years old. 398 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="7">Imanishi: PRIMATE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION will closely coordinate his behavior with the rest of the groul males during an inter-group fight or while leading the grou from one location to another. Dominance rank is easily detected experimentally b' repeating a simple test designed to show which one o two animals will take a given food. Itani (1954) found in Takasakiyama that there wer individual statuses determined by the dominance ran] within each class of males, and that each class itsel also had a status determined by the dominance ran] among the different classes of males, the leader clas having the highest status. The dominance rank is usu ally linear. Dominance rank is not confined to males but is founc also among females and immature animals. Carpentei has written (1942c: 253): This does not preclude the fact that, among the fem-ales as among males, there is also a dominance gradient. As com pared with that of the males, this female dominance gradien is of a lower slope, i.e., females have less absolute dominanci than males and they seem to differ to a small degree. Never theless, the female gradient overlaps that of the males. Thi means that some of the most dominant females are mor dominant than some of the least dominant males. When dominance is studied in immature animals it i, found that there, too, an unstable gradient exists. Indeed, the status of an individual Rhesus monkey begins to be definec during its infancy, after it has begun to engage in social play The existence of central and peripheral females in th( spatial organization of an oikia rightly suggests thai there is this dominance rank among females. However, as Carpenter has not given any concrete example of dominance rank among females or immature animals, the observations by Kawai on the oikia of Koshima (1958) and those by Kawamura on the oikia of Minoo- B (1958) might be mentioned here. In his studies, Kawai found it necessary to distinguish two kinds of dominance rank, "basic rank" and "de- pendent rank." "Basic rank" pertains to the situation where the dominant-subordinate relationship between two monkeys is recognized without interference from other monkeys, while "dependent rank" pertains to the situation where that relationship is recognized with more or less interference from other monkeys. Thus Kawai says (1958: 112): From the developmental viewpoint, it is the dependent ranking that appears first. In the baby stage, these monkeys live in close association with their mothers, and are always under the protection of the latter. So they can behave after their mothers' superiority and gain dependent rank. On the other hand, they themselves are the lowest of the basic rank, or more precisely, they lack basic rank. The basic rank becomes recognized when they have grown to be able to behave independently of its mother [sic] and claim to have their own living. That is, given two infants and their respective mothers, the one whose mother is more dominant in basic rank manifests its dominance over the other one whose mother is less dominant in basic rank, even if the latter infant is more dominant than the former in terms of their own basic rank. Behavioral expression of such "dependent rank" is usual among the female and im- mature Japanese monkeys observed in the field. When such a dependent dominance status is fixed by social conditioning, it may become a basic dominance status. The basic rank is, therefore, not always attributable to physical and/or physiological factors. The basic rank of males in the oikia of Koshima in 1957 was as follows (each animal being signified by a number): 10 &gt; 8 :1&gt; 2&gt; 3 &gt; / 9&gt; 14&gt; 15&gt; 13&gt; 12 11 This roughly represents the age order among them, ex- cept for 12, which seems to be feebleminded. Among them, 8, 9, and 10 are five years old; 11 and 12 are four years old; 13 is three years old; and 14 and 15 are two years old. The basic rank of females in the same year was as follows: :101&gt; 105&gt; 108&gt; 111&gt; 109&gt; 110&gt; 104&gt; 103&gt; 107&gt; 113&gt; 112 Contrary to the case of males, this basic rank does not at all represent the age order of the females. Thus, 107 is six years old; 108, 109, and 110 are five years old; 111 is four years old; and 112 and 113 are one year old. The ages of males and females born before 1950 cannot be determined. As in the oikia of Takasakiyama observed by Itani (1954), infant males in Koshima retire from the central part to the peripheral part of the oikia when they be- come juveniles. This phenomenon may be designated peripherization, after Kawamura (1958). Kawai has suggested that, correlating with this movement, the be- havior concomitant with the dependent rank of the infant in the central part of the oikia decreases, while independent behavior based on the juvenile's own abil- ity increases. As a result, the basic rank among such males is reorganized during and after peripherization. Kawai understands the above-outlined basic rank among young males 8, 10, and 11 as a manifestation of such in-process reorganization. Females, in contrast, remain in the central part from birth to death, so that they constantly grow under the influence of dependent-rank effects, and this, in turn, induces among them a solidification of dependent rank into basic rank. Kawai attributes to such a social process the lack of correlation of the basic rank of females with their age order. At Koshima, three of the adult males (1, 2, and 3) are dominant in basic rank over all the other monkeys including the females. However, in the real life of the oikia, where various dependent-rank effects always co- exist, such a simple relation as might be found between two animals out of the field of any dependent-rank effects does not usually appear. Kawai put a test box, about 50 x 50 x 60 cm. in size, in the feeding place, and observed in what order monkeys of the oikia mounted the box and ate the wheat on it. He called this order the "feeding rank," i.e., a single rank compounded of the basic and dependent ranks including both males and females, and sanctioned by all oikions under these Vol. 1 - Nos. 5-6 * Sept.-Nov. 1960 399</page><page sequence="8">specific circumstances.

Case III shows the recovery of 2 e in the absence of 1 . In this case, 105 and 108 are once again privi- leged in the presence of 2 d to be dominant over 3 &amp;, as they were privileged in the presence of 1 in case I, but 111 and 109 are no longer so privileged. If the influence of 2 &amp; is weakened, as in case IV, 3 &amp; recovers his dominance as in case II. Finally, in case V, where the influence of 1 &amp; and 2 &amp; is completely lacking, 3 8 manifests his basic dominance over all the females. Fe- males situated under 109 in the basic rank are not in- fluenced by the presence or absence of any of the three adult males. Females which are privileged by consort relationship have been carefully excluded from Table 2. From these observations, then, Kawai has determined the social status of each male and female oikion rela- tive to its fellow-oikions. I reproduce his findings as Figure 2, following the same generalized schema al- ready given as Figure 1. This is also a revision of Kawa- mura's schema (1956a) of the spatial distribution of oikions in this same oikia of Koshima, which was based on data obtained by him in 1954. KINSHIP RELATION If a higher dependent rank is accorded the infant of a more dominant female, and if, when this infant is female, the dependent rank is easily transformed into basic rank, as Kawai claims, it is expectable that basic rank among females will not correlate with age order, as is the case among males, but that the daughter of a dominant female will occupy a high status next to her dominant mother. This tendency has already been exemplified with reference to the oikia of Koshima (see basic rank of females in 1957, above), where 108 and 111 are daughters of 105. This tendency reveals itself fully, however, in the oikia of Minoo-B, which has been intensively studied since 1954. This oikia is peculiar in that it has no male leader, though two adult males have snofltanenu1d1 joined it from the neighboring oikia, Minoo-A. Kawa- mura says (1958: 149): It is recognized that there are two important principles forming the rank system of the Minoo-B Group. The first of them is that an infant is ranked after its mother's rank,. and the second is that, among brothers and sisters, the younger is ranked higher than the older. In a supposed group of pure matriarchy, these two principles are combined and involve a rank system as shown in Fig. 1. 2 Males I 1t ~101I \ ' 105 108 7&amp; iemales FIG. 2.

Ages of these individuals are A &gt; B &gt; C, a' &gt; a" &gt; a"', and b' &gt; b". His schema of the rank system of a hypothetical matriachal and matrilineal oikia is reproduced here (Fig. 3), together with the actual rank system found by him in the oikia of Minoo-B in 1958 (Fig. 4). In Figure 4, oikions under three years of age have been omitted because they are so strongly under de- pendent-rank effect relative to their mothers' ranks that their basic rank cannot be adequately determined. Two young males shown in Kawamura's original report are also excluded from Figure 4 because they were al- ready in process of peripherization in this matriarchal and matrilineal oikia. Figure 4 reveals one recognizable exception to the principle, in the relation between Buna and Nemu. Kawamura considers this to be due to the timid personality of Buna. In other oikiae, the younger daughter is not always ranked higher than the elder. In the oikia of Koshima, for instance, 108 is older but ranks higher than. her sibling 111. Kawamura con- siders this to be duie to dependent-rank effect relative to dominant males (e.g., see Table 2, case III). Itani (1958), Kawamura (1956b), and Yamada (1957) have already pointed out that the process by which any oikion learns various habits and social relations is closely connected with its kinship position within the oikia. Imanishi (1957b) has suggested extending appli- cation of the concept "identification" from the social- izing process among human primates to that among subhuman primates. That is, I have pointed out (1957b: 3) that: Children of dominant females involuntarily learn attitudes of the dominant and those of submissive females learn at- titudes of the submissive. Moreover, children of dominant females in the central portion are more intimately related to the leader than those of submissive females in the peripheral portion, as their mothers are more intimately related to the leader. Therefore, children of dominant females may be able to identify more smoothly with their leaders. Imanishi has written also (1957a: 53): If other things are equal, males growing up with successful identification will cooperate with leaders more willingly, be accepted by them as well as by females more easily, and finally succeed their leaders.... In the oikia of Shodoshima-K, a young male was found, in the central part, making no move whatever toward peripherization. According to Kawamura (1959), Yamada recently observed that this young male had won the status of leader. Though he was assumed to be the son of some dominant female, proof was still wanting. I am inclined to agree with Kawamura's an- ticipatory opinion that, if this is the explanation, it represents one of many different courses by which young males become leaders. EPILOGUE Although there are various fruitful approaches to the study of subhuman primates in their natural habi- tat-e.g., the demographical, the ecological, the etho- logical, and the psychobiological-I have in this paper focused on the sociology of Japanese monkeys, and, in particular, on that which has been learned about cer- tain central problems in social organization from the intensive observation of identified individuals over comparatively long time-spans. Except for the question of a breeding season, the reso- lution of which does not necessarily require the identi- fication of individuals, no structural and functional elements of primate social organization can, in my opinion, be definitely demonstrated except by the method of individual identification.

The study of Japanese monkeys has been carried on not only according to the method of individual identi- fication, but also with exact knowledge of the pedigree of each individual. This latter has yielded insights into the importance of kinship ties in the social organization of subhuman primates, something hitherto little no- ticed. As this kind of study is continued, there may be found a way to solve the question of the origin of the incest taboo or of the family in human societies. Further, though I have not mentioned the fact in this present paper, there are behavioral variations from oikia to oikia of the Japanese monkeys under observa- tion, to the extent that any generalization on the basis of observation of only one oikia cannot a priori be considered valid (Kawamura 1956b; Frisch 1959). Ac- cordingly if an experimental oikia is created success- fully from individuals of two different oikiae, it may in course of time reveal whether and how much behavioral characteristics derive from heredity and/or culture. The fruitfulness of the provisionization technique has been proved to some degree in the study of Japanese monkeys. By now, twenty-one oikiae of Japanese mon- keys in various parts of Japan are provisionized, and fourteen of them are under study by the method of individual identification. Above all, two of them are under the management of the Japan Monkey Center as experimental oikiae. Prospects of the study, so far as Japanese monkeys are concerned, are, I believe, very promising. Comments By FRANSOIS BOURLIE'RE* (1) Imanishi is perfectly right when he criticizes the use by too many field naturalists of terms such as "harem" and "clan," which have a very precise meaning in cultural anthropology. To date, most of the naturalistic studies of the social life of wild primates have been of extremely short duration, and none has been based on prolonged follow-up of free-ranging groups, the various members of which were in- dividually known to the observer. That is precisely what makes the Japanese studies unique in the field of infra- human sociology. (2) The observations recorded in this paper represent more instances of that intra-specific variability of social be- haviour which seems almost as char- acteristic of primates as their morpho- logical variability. The case of the Minoo-B group, which has no male leader, is particularly striking. (3) The importance of age as a de- terminant of social hierarchy, at least among males, is also worthy of remark. May I point out, however, that this characteristic is not at all peculiar to primates, and not even to mammals? Reliable reports have demonstrated its existence in social birds: e.g., W. J. L. Sladen (1958) has described at length the role of the various age-groups in the complex society of Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae). By C. R. CARPENTER* Imanishi's splendid review of the re- sults of field studies of nonhuman pri- mates and especially of the very sig- nificant contributions of the Japan Monkey Center raises a number of major problems which primatologists and anthropologists need to consider. (1) Inter-Cultural or Inter-Language Communication. When concepts, ab- stract thought, and even observations are formulated in English, translated into Japanese, and re-translated into English, both the denotive and con- notative qualitatives of terminology and language are changed. The largely qualitative descriptions now of neces- sity used by field observers of free- ranging primates are often originally inadequate to reflect accurately the ob- served behavior. Translation and re- translation of such descriptions in- creases the difficulty of arriving at consensuses about the common-denomi- nator meanings, first of observations, and then of the language vehicles. At this stage of development, or lack of development, in the branch of science that requires the investigation of organized populations of nonhuman primates in their natural habitats, ob- servers are confronted with the ex- ceedingly difficult task of contributing to the emergence of terminology and language, graphic and pictorial signs and symbols, and mathematical expres- sions which are true to the observed data and with respect to which there can be inter-cultural and interlin- gual agreement. Clearly, there is a need to progress from qualitative descrip- tions, though without neglecting the refinement of them, to the formulation of quantitative expressions which ac- curately represent behavior, social in- teractions, characteristics of group or- ganizations, population dynamics, and ecological factors. Field studies of pri- mates, including man, will eventually require appropriate field theory and field mathematics. A developed, known, and accepted language of mathematics will reduce the distortions and ambiguities now involved in trans- lations of verbal descriptions of ob- served phenomena. There is another important aspect of inter-cultural scientific communication. There are differences in traditions of criticism, so that (for example) Orien- tal scientists may think improper the skepticism and challenging criticism that Western scientists consider indis- pensable in a developing branch of science. Such differences may inhibit free criticism in both directions. Finally, on this problem, the in- creasingly numerous primatologists of all nationalities interested in the nat- uralistic studies of nonhuman primates demonstrate extreme variability in training, in approach to research, in sophistication in biological and be- havioral science theories, and, accord- ingly, in the technical language that they command and use. The require- ments of objectivity and accuracy are often violated by the use of inferential, subjective, and anthropomorphic lan- guage. Field primatologists are at pres- ent a heterogeneous interdisciplinary group representing psychology, anthro- pology, the medical sciences and arts, biology, and ecology. Thus, to the problems of inter-language and inter- cultural communication are added the problems of interdisciplinary communi- cation. (2) The Place of Theory in Natu- ralistic Research on Nonhuman Pri- mates. This difficult problem is raised early in Imanishi's review. Primatologists generally assume theo- ries of evolution. Likewise, they accept genetic theories. Most of them are aware of theories of ecology like that of biotic equilibra and dynamics. All use some form of behavioral theory in- cluding theories of development, moti- vation, and learning. Therefore, field studies which do not expound theory may nevertheless be oriented both from and to theoretical systems or sub- systems of principles, propositions, and hypotheses which provide a theoretical 402 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="11">Imanishi: PRIMATE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION frame of reference for the investigators The following questions are raise( by Imanishi's review: How is adequat( theory derived? When in the sequence of scientific thought should theory b the focus of attention and effort? Wha should be the order of theoretical for mulations relative to observations? And finally, what is good theory, and what i. its effect on the quality and produc tivity of research, especially of field re search? Imanishi seems to propose that in dividual identification of animals "provisionization," "acculturation,' the "oikia" concept, "basic rank," "de pendent rank," the breeding season and "peripheralization" constitute needed advances in theory. It is sug gested that individual identification and "provisionization" are important techniques or procedures, and are not theories. The other terms mentioned above are highly general ones which reflect ways of describing the results of extensive observations made over time General theory and dependable prin- ciples are probably just emerging in the research reports of field primatologists Furthermore, theories (if they be such) like "acculturation," dominance ranks and statuses or classes, kinship be havior, etc., are transposed from othei disciplines. The substitution of neu terms for previously used terms should perhaps be carried out with care and caution and justified by evidence There is a fine but necessary distinction between the developing of a new, use- ful, and adequate scientific terminology and the using of neologisms. Single o0 limited terms, new or old, do not constitute adequate theoretical state- ments. Words like "harem," "group," "troop," "cluster," "sub-group," or "oikia" are not statements of theory, but, rather, highly generalized symbols. Theory is a generalized, unproven and tentative statement, or series of state- ments, based on sets or systems of ob- servations that orient the collecting of additional observations and evidence, which, in turn, when collected, system- atized, and interpreted, may modify the earlier statement of theory. General theory can be used to increase the ac- curacy of predictions of a range of related but specific behavior, interac- tions, and social-organization character- istics. Some theories, when used in the course of a scientific attempt to build a body of dependable knowledge, e.g., on the social behavior of free-ranging primates, may limit and restrict ob- servations. Assumptions may operate similarly. This focusing of observations may be advantageous, for instance in proving an hypothesis, or, the focusing miv nrevenh d the brver- from- gpeina- appropriately evaluating, and record- ing behavioral events that are not within the range of observations to- cused by theory. Imanishi is certainly correct in call- ing for theory construction-the de- veloping of field methodology-and in contributing to this effort. But there are steps, developments, and sequences of events, such as earlier field studies and even present-day field studies, which may be necessary preliminaries to the formulation of adequate theories. Furthermore, as has been stated earlier, naturalistic studies or contextual re- search on primates, nonhuman or hu- man, reflect some theory, however gen- eral or specific. In addition, it might be observed that clearly-formulated questions like, "What is the composi- tion of groups in terms of central ten- dencies and variabilities of a species of primate?" may serve well to guide field observations. By contrast, hypotheses like those which postulate, that non- human primates are monogamous, polygamous, or promiscuous may bias, distort, or even preclude accurate ob- servations. An approach of seeking an- swers to hundreds of simple direct ques- tions about all characteristics of howler monkeys' behavior, and social and ecological interactions, seems to have been relatively productive while not primarily theoretical. Perhaps what the emerging area of field studies of nonhuman (and hu- man) primates now needs is a complete system of categories of questions that need to be answered. The answers could then be collated in defined cate- gories for all species of nonhuman pri- mates. The resulting information pool would correspond to the Area Files of anthropologists. This approach would contribute importantly to the rigorous formulation of testable hypotheses and the construction of general theo- ries. Surely, theoretical hypotheses do sharpen and intensify observations. (3) Generalization of Observations across Genera and Species. Imanishi's review has raised this problem in sharp definition. The central task here, as Imanishi clearly realizes, is that of de- scribing, charting, and measuring, when possible, the full ranges of char- acteristics of nonhuman primate be- havior, including social organization and grouping patterns. This requires study of the variabilities which occur in different genera and species. Vari- abilities are to be expected in social behavior and organization, both in the higher-order complexes of behavior where learning has a prominent role, and in behavior which is anatomically determined and limited like postures, prehension, locomotion, and sound production. Such study must take ac- count of habitat and environmental determinants of the observed similar- ities and differences. Currently avail- able data, collected on an inadequate sampling of genera and species by a heterogeneous group of observers, and using different methods in different en- vironments, do not provide the neces- sary information for completely ade- quate comparisons over the full range of the sub-order of nonhuman pri- mates. In the meantime, we must do as Imanishi has done, make compar- isons among the species for which we have relatively reliable and fairly ade- quate information. Much long-term and intensive field work is needed on many little-known species to complete the picture. Our conclusions, therefore, must be tentative, and variations, gaps, and inconsistencies in our knowledge are to be expected. The length of this commentary pre- cludes a detailed criticism of Imanishi's very stimulating review. Most of the detailed differences in language, view- points, inferences, and opinions could be resolved best by co-operative simul- taneous field work in the same context with the same species of primate. When the objects of observation are con- fronted by several observers, it may be possible to align concepts and de- velop common understanding. Imanishi and his colleagues at the Japan Monkey Center and elsewhere throughout the world where they are conducting fie'ld studies, deserve to be highly complimented on their effective efforts to add to the knowledge in primatology. For thirty years field stud- ies of monkeys and apes have been the lonely fate of a few hybrid scientists. Now, upsurges of interest and effort are occurring, and men like Imanishi are importantly responsible for this rapid development in naturalistic and con- textual research on the nonhuman pri- mates. By M. R. A. CHANCE* Imanishi's paper marks a distinct advance in our thought about the so- cial organisation of sub-human pri- mates, for by collating the various re- ports on different species of social primate in the wild it adduces new evi- dence on the role of sexuality in pri- mate societies. While Zuckerman never explicitly stated that he considered the factor underlying the permanent association of the sexes was persistent sexual at- Vol. 1 Nos. 5-6 * Sept.-Nov. 1960 403</page><page sequence="12">traction, this has, in fact, been con- sidered to be one of the main purports of his work. Elsewhere Mead and I have shown that long periods of sexual receptivity in the female primate lead to intense conflict (not necessarily overt) among males, as can be deduced from the nature of reproductive life in other mammals (Chance and Mead 1953). In most species of mammal, pairs separate for breeding from other pairs, and thus disrupt what, in some instances, is an otherwise continuous social group. Thus in other mammals sexuality is a disruptive element, and, therefore, an added bond is required to explain the sociability of monkeys. While Imanishi has not directed his attention to this-a point which it will be most interesting to have his comments on in the future -still, by showing that many species of monkeys have a cyclical breeding ac- tivity without interruption of their sociability, he has emphasized that sexual attraction cannot be the pri- mary bond of primate society. To discover that sexual attraction is, not a bond, but a disruptive element, in a society of monkeys or apes, is not necessarily to contradict the statement that the factors underlying associations of monkeys and apes are connected with the prominent part that sexual behaviour plays in their social reper- toire-a point Zuckerman draws atten- tion to separately, but which later be- came treated as synonymous with continuous reproduction (which he deduced from other evidence by shoot- ing the wild troop of baboons). These are two quite different features of the primate, as sexuality is an attribute of behaviour, whereas reproduction is a biological attribute and one which is not directly correlated with sexual per- formance. It is less easy to be wholeheartedly in agreement with Imanishi's second disagreement with what Zuckerman wrote, about the structure of primate families. To my mind the term "fam- ily" is no more than a casually descrip- tive one when applied to primate societies, and is yet another example of terms like "neurotic" or "convulsive" which, transported from their human context, carry implications which are later found not to reside in the nature of sub-human vertebrate behaviour. Hence, I consider that this discussion is somewhat less substantial and re- volves round the use of a word which is itself not an accurate theoretical concept. Similarly, although I think the word "oikia" has more to recom- mend it, in the way it is defined by Imanishi, than the word "family," it tends to introduce a classification which may rigidify. While it at present enables us to classify and distinguish the different forms of the social unit, it may deflect attention from the fact that these units are not necessarily characteristic of a species but of a species living under certain conditions. This has already been demonstrated by the work of Collias and Southwick (1952). The essential characteristic of a primate society is the fact that mem- bers of both sexes live together within the structure created by a male domi- nance order which may cause a break-up into "family" groups, or groups with other special character- istics. Thus, I would direct more attention to the dynamic characteristics of these groups, in an attempt to define those underlying processes of an individual's behaviour which are responsible for its interactions with other members of the group. That there is more than one type of bond seems evident, just as there is more than one type of dominance re- lationship. Here Imanishi has given us both a useful distinction, in bringing forward evidence that dominance can be based upon hereditary factors or upon acquired patterns of behaviour, and has also, I think, added clarity to this field in showing how these two can interact. By JOHN T. EMLEN, JR.* The inadequacy of channels of in- ternational communication, the prob- lem to which CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY has dedicated its energies, is responsi- ble for a wide ignorance of the impor- tant contributions which a group of primatologists in Japan have been making towards an understanding of the basic mechanisms of social organi- zation, in higher animals. Imanishi has rendered a great service by bringing together for a world audience some of the important findings of the members of his Institute. Of particular value is his review of observations on kinship relations and their role in the determi- nation of social rank in free-ranging populations of the Japanese Macaque. Through persistent and patient watch- ing of animals and their social inter- actions over a succession of years, Imanishi and his colleagues have dem- onstrated that the social ranking of individuals, especially females, is often determined indirectly by association. The situation closely resembles certain well-known phenomena in human so- cialization, and Imanishi cautiously though convincingly suggests that the social psychologists' concept of "identi- fication" may legitimately be applied to the development of these simian behaviors. The problem of semantics often arises in studies of non-human behav- ior, especially where strict objectivity demands the avoidance of words which hold, or seem to hold, human implica- tions. The words "group," "subgroup," "troop," "family," and "harem" have given rise to confusion in studies of primate societies, and Imanishi has pro- posed that two new words, oikia and oikion, be introduced to dispel this confusion, the former to designate the minimum unit of social life regardless of composition, the latter to designate one of the components of an oikia. Such new terms are, to be sure, free of undesirable implications. I question, however, whether workers will not still find it necessary to define terms as they apply them to different species and dif- ferent situations. In comparative stud- ies I doubt that any adoption or re- vision of terminology will solve our basic problems of understanding the evolutionary significance of similarities and differences. What is needed is an operational approach with a minimum of classified technical terms. While on the subject of terms, I would like to take this opportunity to join Allee and Carpenter in protesting the widespread and indiscriminate use of the words "subhuman" and "infra- human" in situations other than those which purport to compare the evolu- tionary progress or performance levels of various animals with those attained by man. These terms reflect an an- thropocentric viewpoint which is gen- erally unintentional but which should be consciously avoided by anthropolo- gists and biologists in the interest of over-all objectivity of approach. Where the issue is simply one of excluding man from consideration, the word "non-human" would seem to be pref- erable. The comparative study of social or- ganization in primates has been a fer- tile and fascinating area for specula- tion. With only a handful of species examined, even superficially, we are al- ready besieged with a flood of chal- lenging theories and suggestions on underlying social principles, origins of human social behavior, and even ori- gins of higher mental capacities. Such speculations play a valuable role in stimulating and guiding new research, but the real need at this stage is clearly for more solid facts of the kind that the Japan Monkey Center has been accumu- lating. Intensive studies must be made on representative members of all major groups to reveal, not only the nature of differences between taxa, but the range of variation occurring among ecologically separated populations of single species. Comparative studies of a wide virietv of vertebraite and even 404 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="13">Imanishi: PRIMATE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION invertebrate animals are, in fact, needed to provide the best possible per- spective for interpreting the complex pattern of converging and diverging trends which characterize the evolu- tion of behavior in any single group. It may be worth noting, for instance, that the closest parallels with man in the area of family development-shar- ing of parental duties by mated pairs, and even connubial fidelity-are to be found, not among non-human pri- mates, but among birds. As in any comparative study, the basis for detect- ing homologies, or for tracing evolu- tionary trends, can best be found through a wide acquaintance with or- ganic variation. By ADOLPH H. SCHULTZ* (1) The discovery of such a surpris- ingly clear-cut breeding season in the Japanese Macaque presents problems for specialists in the physiology of re- production as well as for students of social behavior. Such an extreme sea- sonal limitation of reproduction is rare in the suborder of simian primates, among which a more or less recogniz- able preferential breeding season seems to represent the rule. At any rate, for the majority of wild-shot tropical mon- keys and apes, collectors have obtained all stages of pre- and post-natal devel- opment at all times of the year. In howler and in spider monkeys, for ex- ample, I found early embryos, fetuses of varied sizes, and nursing infants, all at practically the same time and place. By establishing a colony of the ex- ceptional Macaca fuscata at some trop- ical station, one might detect possible environmental factors influencing such seasonal changes in the birth rate. (2) In the interesting discussion of dominance rank, it is stated that this is "not always attributable to physical and/or physiological factors," but, of the latter, only some data on age are given. It would be interesting to cor- relate rank also with the relative size, sexual status, and, whenever possible, with the health, of the individuals. Heavy *parasitic infections, miscar- riages, etc., are far from rare in wild monkeys, and alveolar abscesses, arthri- tis, healed fractures, etc., become very frequent with advancing age and are bound to influence ranking behavior. That "leaders of the oikia are esti- mated to be over twenty-five years old" (footnote 3) is hardly tenable, in view of the fact that skeletons of captive monkeys, known to have lived over twenty years, all show unmistakable signs of senility, with bony atrophy, very advanced wear and loss of teeth, and usually multiple arthritic changes. (3) According to the welcome data in footnote 1, of 100 to 115 mature females, 59 had offspring between Ma) and November, and the others had ap parently not conceived (due to lacta tion or old age?). This high birth rat( would be expected to surpass the death rate in a monkey population, such as this in Japan, which is not held ii check by predators. These newborns, as well as the 120 infants, contain prac tically equal numbers of both sexes; but, among the older individuals, ther( are only 66 males as against 135 fe males, indicating a much higher mor tality in the former. It is to be hoped that Imanishi and his collaborators will investigate the reasons for this differ- ential mortality rate. (4) Most non-primatologists take it subconsciously for granted that man has climbed to the highest branch on the primate family-tree while all oux contemporary simian relations have re- mained below us in every respect and hence can simply be called "subhu. man." However, there are a great many features with respect to which man has not become as highly specialized as have some other primates, but, rather, approximates the original condition more closely. The popular term "sub- human" implies a scale of evaluation which can be used merely for single characters and becomes a misleading generalization when applied indiscrim- inately to all non-human primates. By S. L. WASHBURN and IRVEN DEVORE* Our observations on baboons in Kenya indicate that there is a marked seasonal peak in births at the begin- ning of the rains in October. The fe- male has a clearly-defined sexual cycle, and is receptive for less than a third of this cycle. Early in estrus, females solicit the attention of the males, and during the later phases the males ini- tiate sexual activity and form tempo- rary "consort relationships." Troops number from 9 to 185, and within the troop there are no subgroupings which could be called "families" or "harems." The minimal social unit is a female and her infant. Subgroups consisting of an adult male and one or two fe- males, plus infants or juveniles, are formed frequently. These are tempo- rary preference groups, and the estrus female remains in no such subgroup- ing. In summary, sexual activity in Kenya baboons is marked by: (1) a seasonal birth peak, (2) female estrus, and (3) promiscuity, modified by tem- porary male-female consort relation- On the basis of far less evidence, we think that the situation in vervets (Cercopithecus aethiops) is similar. There is a birth peak and no evidence of "family" or "harem." Dominance is present but less marked than in ba- boons. In both baboons and vervets the only stable, lasting social unit is the troop. The troop exists because it helps the members to survive in many ways. That sexual attraction is an en- tirely inadequate explanation for the troop is best shown by the fact that during most of her life a female is not involved in sexual activity. Most of the time she is either juvenile, out of estrus, pregnant, or lactating. Yet she does not leave the troop even for a few minutes. She is most central in the structure of the troop when she has a new baby, and is often peripheral when she is in estrus. We are doubtful that it will be use- ful to anthropologists to have a single word ("oikia") for all kinds of minimal social units. Terminology should not obscure the fact that a gibbon group of male-female plus young, a baboon female and infant, or a troop, are fun- damentally very different units. The continued study of provisioned monkeys offers the opportunity of ana- lysing many problems. The great con- tribution of Imanishi and his co- workers is the understanding of the social structure which comes from con- tinued study over the years. The stabil- ity of the hierarchy, age of the leaders, the relation of female dominance to the position of the young, sibling re- lations-in these our only data on free- ranging primates comes from the Japan Monkey Center, and we hope that more of their observations will be pub- lished in CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY. By SIR SOLLIE ZUCKERMAN* Imanishi's most interesting review, which summarizes some striking work that has recently been carried out in Japan, has also been framed to give the impression that the information about Primate sociology collected since 1932 necessarily controverts cer- tain basic principles which had already emerged from observations of captive and wild baboons. A careful study of the new material makes me doubtful whether these new data are, in fact, in- consistent with the general theses first developed in my Social Life of Mon- keys and Apes, to which Imanishi refers so generously. The first of these general theses was that the continued association of the Vol. 1 - Nos. 5-6 * Sept.-Nov. 1960 405</page><page sequence="14">("family parties") depends upon fac- tors connected with the recurring menstrual cycle characteristic of all Old World Primates. Imanishi appears to be under the impression that this im- plies a uniform rate of breeding throughout the year, and in an attempt partially to question the thesis, quotes data which appear to indicate that there is a seasonal increase in the num- bers of births in certain Primate species. At the time my book appeared I was aware that seasonal variations occur in the incidence of births in various species of monkey, and have, in fact, written two or three papers on the sub- ject. Nonetheless, if it eventually emerges that in some higher Primates- the numbers of births fluctuate from month to month, this would not neces- sarily be of significance, as, for ex- ample, the variation may be due to factors other than changes in the sexual cycles of the females. Even the possi- bility that there may be seasonal varia- tion in the intensity of sexuality does not affect the basic issue, that there is always a sexual-social link. The new data relating to an apparent seasonal increase in the frequency of copulation in the Japanese Macaque are interest- ing, but as presented in the review it is not possible to assess whether or not they represent a true fluctuation or whether the monthly variation can be reasonably attributed to chance. T he second basic principle of Pri- mate sociology, to which Imanishi re- fers, is that the composition of the social unit together with the behaviour of its members depends on the position of the principal male in a scale of dominance relative both to other mem- bers of his own unit and to those of neighbouring groups. This proposition gains support from Carpenter's studies of the social organisation of rhesus monkeys, and although initially it ap- peared that an island population of howler monkeys was organised differ- ently, it is noteworthy that in the course of some twenty years the com- position of its units changed to re- semble that of the family parties of Old World monkeys. There is little doubt that some varia- tion exists in the composition of the basic social units, but provided these are homologous in different species there is an obvious advantage in Imanishi's suggestion that a single standard term should be used for their description. Such variations as exist may be correlated with differences in the manifestation of dominance among the males, and Imanishi's techniques for studying individual groups from free-ranging colonies have already pro- vided significant new data relating to Reply By KINJI IMANISHI Bourli&amp;re, asserting the "importance of age as a determinant of social hierarchy, at least among males," points out the importance of age in the social organization of Adelie penguins. I applaud his emphasis, for I have re- garded sex and age as two of the princi- pal factors segmenting societies of higher animals. Among male Japanese monkeys, relative age seems to be a more basic and stable principle of organization than dominance rank, which is complicated by status differ- ences among individuals belonging to the same age class. As Schultz rightly remarks, dominance rank is apt to be influenced by individual peculiarities such as state of health, etc. It is recog- nized that dominance rank among young, peripheral males is highly un- stable. However, once a male becomes a central male or leader, he never re- verts to being a peripheral male be- cause central males and peripheral males form two distinct age classes. Nor does an aged leader always rank low. The former head leader of the oikia of Shodoshima S was so old that he could not climb a tree any more; notwith- standing, he retained his status as leader and fulfilled this role until he died in his oikia (observed by S. Kawa- mura). As a supplementary piece of in- formation: a leader of the oikia of Takasakiyama disappeared when he found he could not keep his status as a leader (Mizuhara 1957: 186-203). Schultz infers from the numerical discrepancy between post-infancy males and females in the Takasakiyama oikia that the males suffer a much higher mortality. This may be true to some extent, but is is also true that, of the considerable number of solitary males, some have left the natal oikia in the process of peripherization. Both Schultz and Emlen protest the use of the word "subhuman." I also would not apply the term indiscrimi- nately to all "non-human" primates, e.g., to lemurs or bushbabies. But as a social anthropologist I am interested in the origin of culture, and, in my usage, the "subhuman" level of primates is nearly equivalent to the "subcultural" level of primates. It is well known that there are two distinct but complementary scientific approaches, viz., the nomothetic and idiographic. While Carpenter seems to recommend the former approach, I am rather inclined to pursue the latter in the long-term observation of Japanese monkeys. However, as Carpenter says, it is indeed necessary for us to find a way to overcome the difficulties of inter- cultural or inter-language communica- tion and reach mutual understanding i-n th-%fm n il of RtIrl-I References Cited ALTMANN, S.
