<plain_text><page sequence="1">The molecular biology of development By James Bonner./?/?. vii+ 155 . Oxford: Clarendon Press , 1965 . 25s. Readers' reactions to this book will be varied and vigorous but whatever their diversity there will be one common 305</page><page sequence="2">Reviews characteristic ; no one can fail to be excited by the ideas it contains. In its dozen brief chapters the author tells the story of the attempts, in the last few years and mainly in his own laboratory, to link our know- ledge of molepular genetics to the prob- lems of the control of differentiation and development in higher organisms. The information is really 'hot off the press'; three-quarters of the 200 or so selected references are post- 1961. After an introductory Chapter, Pro- fessor Bonner sweeps us along the fascinating pathways of modern bio- logical techniques where cell organelles and macromolecules can be isolated and purified and persuaded to perform in the test-tube the controlling functions they may perform in the cell. The reader is then shown, step by step, the experi- mental unravelling of the mechanisms whereby the total hereditary information for the organism, encoded in the de- oxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of chromo- somes may be turned on or off as develop- ment proceeds. Thus the second chapter on 'Chromosome Husbandry' deals with studies on chromatin isolated from seed- lings of pea. It shows how the DNA of such chromatin supports the synthesis of ribonucleic acid (RNA) which in its turn can promote the synthesis of protein by isolated ribosomes. The main theme of the whole book centres round the finding that pea-bud chromatin will not in this way support the production of the protein (globulin) that is characteristic of pea cotyledons, until it has been freed of the basic protein (histones) that are com- plexed with the chromosomal DNA. Thus the histones are deduced to be the agents for 'turning off the genes'; in the pea-bud chromatin they complex with that DNA which contains the code for cotyledon globulin. After thus setting the scene the author deals in the next chapter with methods that can be used for 'amplifying the chromosome message' by employing the much more active enzymes (RNA- polymerase) from a bacterium (E. coli). In the next three chapters he discusses the problems of the transcription of the mes- sage of the double-stranded DNA mole- cule on to the single-stranded messenger RNA and the ultimate method of de- coding this message on the ribosomes. In a chapter devoted to work with his col- leagues on isolated nuclei and nuclear components he demonstrates that the nucleolus is the 'engine of ribosomal syn- thesis', although the many questions raised by this claim are still left un- answered. Turning back in the next chapter to gene control, he surveys our present knowledge of the chemistry of the his- tones and discusses, in view of their relatively limited variety, problems raised by their apparently highly specific gene regulating action. Then follows a chapter describing the experiments on the recon- stitution of chromatin from DNA and histones and the light they throw on the mechanism and probable specificities of DNA-histone complexing. There is here much speculation and working hypo- thesis for the future. As an introduction to his final thesis the author devotes a chapter to enzyme induction and sup- pression in bacteria and the concepts of regulator, operator and structural genes. He then surveys the evidence, mainly from animal physiology but also from plants, of how hormones can be related to the control of RNA and hence of specific enzymes synthesis. The culminating 'tour de force' is a blueprint for developmental control adapting the hypothesis of his- tone-switching into a kind of nuclear computer programme. The reader is swept along, alternately charmed and irritated by the author's style, which is a strange mixture of anthropomorphism and jargon, some- times inadequately explained. For ex- ample, DNA and RNA are nowhere defined, although this is not particularly serious since these abbreviations are on every schoolboy's lips. Here and there obviously hurried writing has introduced 306</page><page sequence="3">Reviews some ambiguities which may confuse the not so well equipped reader. Whatever its shortcomings as regards style, the book has great merits. At all points in the complex story, all key experiments are well described and each successive stage in the attack on particular problems is logically argued. This is a book that all discriminating biologists should read. They will find in it much stimulus and food for thought and, for the research worker, a wealth of ideas for future experimentation over a wide biological field. L. J. Audus</page></plain_text>
