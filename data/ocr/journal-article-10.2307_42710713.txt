VAN DE WAAL Rembrandt's Faust Etching, a Socinian document, and the iconography of the inspired scholar 'There is probably no etching by Rembrandt which has given rise to such flights of imagination in interpretation as the so-called Faust'. Ludwig Münz, The Etchings of Rembrandt , London 1952. One of the difficulties involved in adding a new view to the long series of interpretations of Rem- brandt's Faust etching, extending over almost three hundred years, is that the author cannot confine himself to putting forward his own ideas but must also summarize those of his predecessors. These can, roughly speaking, be divided into two groups : 1 . Those who draw a connection between the print's traditional name, 'Dr. Faustus', and the Faust legend. 2. Those who reject this name as misleading. I hope to be able to show in this article that in all probability neither opinion is correct. (For a chronological survey of the various theories, the reader is referred to Appendix 1, p. 45). To list the facts first: the print is undated, unsigned, and no known copy bears any inscription. The attribution to Rembrandt has nonetheless never been questioned, and the generally accepted date is fixed around 1650 to 1653.1 The complications begin with the question of what this print actually represents. We will therefore give a brief prefatory description (Fig. facing this page): In a room beside a window, a man whose dress shows him to be a scholar stands between a chair and a writing table. On the table a reading-stand and a few books, to the right a globe. The man holds a pen in his right hand, leans with his right hand on the table, his left hand on the chair; he looks thought- fully and with no sign of fright in the direction of a complex phenomenon in the window. This phenomenon consists of four parts : 1) parallel with the window a shining disk containing in its centre the monogram of Christ, inri, surrounded by two concentric rings with the following inscription : + ADAM + TS + DAGERAM + AMRTET + ALGAR + ALGASTNA + + 2) almost perpendicular to the window, a round mirror; 3) an upper arm, lower arm, hand, and a finger pointing in the direction of the mirror; 4) behind the mirror a vague, almost obliterated, anthropomorphic shape, partly covering the window-frame. Further, hanging by the window, a bundle of folded papers and, - more to the left - among a few other items, a set of shelves on the wall containing a skull and some books. 1. Bartsch 270; Hind 260; Münz 275, I, pl. 323-4 and II p. 117; Biörklund 52-4. The various states show no noticeable differences. The print was copied by Watelet (see C. L. Stieglitz in Historisches Taschenbuch , hrsg. von Fr. v. Raumer V, 1834) and Lips (see note 6). 7</page><page sequence="3">There has been increasing dissatisfaction with the traditional title Dr. Faustus by which the etching has been listed in catalogues since 17312, because the etching contains no indications of either a temp- tation by Satan or of an evocation although both are essential elements of the Faust legend. In an attempt to overcome these objections, Leendertz in 1921/24 advanced the argument of a Faust play which, although we know it only from a 1731 text, may be assumed to have been performed in Am- sterdam in the middle of the seventeenth century as a version of Marlowe's Faust? The Dutch text of this play contains a scene in which Faust, on the point of signing the pact with the Devil, is warned by his good angel. Faust : Wat heldren glans zie ik daar blinken voor my ne oogen Beschermengel: Ontwaak , de Satan heeft u, Faustus , al bedroogen Faust: What bright radiance shines thus before my eyes? Guardian Angel: Awake Faustus, Satan has already tricked you. Among the objections raised to this evidence is the fact that this scene does not show a man being disturbed by his guardian angel while bargaining with the Devil, and that not only the Devil but also the guardian angel, so important in this context, are missing. In any case, the few unambiguous representations of the Faust-legend known from the seventeenth century4 are characterized by an entirely different spirit (Figs. 1 and 3) ; and the only general incan- tation scene known to us from Rembrandt's immediate circle, a painting by his pupil Aert de Gelder, is set in a very different key5 (Fig. 2). Nevertheless, Leendertz's view still finds support. As recently as 1956, Wolthuis wrote that 'there [can] no longer be any reasonable doubt as to the source of Rembrandt's subject'.6 The other group of interpreters base themselves on the mood of intense and devote concentration with which the scene is imbued. They felt encouraged when they remembered that as early as 1890 Bredius and De Roever had published an inventory from 1679 in which this etching (and unmis- takably this one) is described as The Practising Alchemist.7 In 1938 and subsequent years, Bojanowski 2.

For the sake of completeness it may be mentioned that a number of prints by Jor. van Vliet after early Rembrandt heads were copied by the seventeenth century French art dealer Fr. Langlois, called Ciartres, and circulated as portraits of Faust (Wegner, op. cit., p. 18; L.

According to them, the deep meaning concealed in the print could be summed up more or less as follows: 6 All our human knowledge is nothing without Divine love'. Bojanowski summarized the results in concise German as : 'Man sollte aufhören, die Radierung Rembrandts mit dem willkürlich dazu gekommenen Namen Faust zu benennen: er ist irreführend und versperrt jeden Zugang zu den Tiefen des Kunstwerks.'9 Amulets after J. Reichelt, Exercitatio de amuletis, Strasburg 1676 Two schools of thought thus remained stalemated until Dr. H. M. Rotermund introduced new material in 1957. He - and others after him - succeeded in finding other occurrences of our texts which proved to be traditional formulae related to magic amulets and magic hosts10 (Figs 1 6 and textillustration p. 9). Rotermund also gave an explanation of the outermost ring which - read in reverse - contains among other things the ancient Cabbalistic notarikon agla, a formula derived from the text of the most frequent prayer in the Jewish rites, the Schemone essre or eight hour prayer11, and which as a word of special power was already known among Christians in the middle ages. 8.

(. . . by nature an adjective, often used in place of a noun, meaning God himself . . . in Latin translated as almighty . . . Greek Pantokrátor, that is almighty).16 Rotermund's conclusion runs: with these amulets and charms we are far from 1 Cor. 13 and thus back in the sphere of magic and thus back to the Faust legend. He returned to the old Faustus play cited by Leendertz and tried to find in it - without convincing results - a scene with either an incan- tation or a redemption that corresponded with Rembrandt's representation. So much for a brief history of the problem.17 It is remarkable that actually all the interpreters are content with indicating a given text as the parallel, without feeling any need to concern themselves with the preliminary question: what could have been, in connection with these sources and in the Amsterdam of the seventeenth century, the function of an etching of this kind? This is the moment, I think, to keep in mind that not everything is possible in all times. The ana- chronistic conception of a Rembrandt who, returning home from the theatre, would have made this etching under the influence of what he had just experienced, conflicts with everything we know of both Rembrandt and the production of art in the seventeenth century. If it had been a drawing the case would be somewhat different, but for a print of this kind we must - if only as a working hypothesis - start from the assumption that it must have been commissioned. In other words, that it must have been made for a particular purpose and for a particular group. The crypto-magic element, which - thanks to recent studies - can now be recognized in the etching, makes it even more justifiable to stipulate a very special purpose and a very special group. It now seems possible to come closer to identifying those for whom this Faust print must have been intended. A striking, and previously unnoticed, parallel has turned the investigation in a new direction. Luther's translation of the New Testament , first published by Hans Lufft in 1529 in Wittemberg, bears among its illustrations four woodcuts by Lucas Cranach the Elder showing the four Evangelists. The first print of this series represents the Evangelist Matthew writing in his studyn (Fig. 5). Before him stands his attribute, the angel, holding a mirror by which the rays of the Holy Ghost (symbolized by the dove) are directed to the pious author who (as it has always been taken) has the features of Luther. If it is also taken into consideration that this is the first of the illustrations in the book, being for the first gospel, and that this Evangelist shows a resemblance to Martin Luther, it does not seem too far-fetched to assume that this illustration must have been considered as the frontispiece of the whole 16.

For a list of editions in which the print also occurs, see : Hollstein, Ger- man engravings vi, p. 34. il</page><page sequence="7">book. In this way, according to an idea common in that period, a parallelism was established between the two figures, Saint Matthew and Luther, both working under divine inspiration.19 The composition is probably related to the portrait of Luther (with the dove of the Holy Ghost hovering above him, writing before a crucifix) in a woodcut occurring in the edition of the translation of the New Testament published in 1 525 by H. Hergot in Nürnberg (Fig. 7). This print may in turn be related to a woodcut by Hans Baidung Grien of 1521 which caused much sensation because the head of the reformer is shown within a nimbus (Fig. 6).20 If we compare the etching by Rembrandt with the woodcut by Cranach (Figs. 4 and 5), the following points of agreement strike us : 1 . the circle of light near the window ; 2. the vague shape near the window (corresponding with the angel holding the mirror) ; 3. the fact that here a mirror serves as an instrument for depicting Divine Inspiration. Respecting the last of these points it may be remarked that we are concerned here with a very infrequent form, one which Cranach never made use of again. In the numerous illustrations of the Bible made by Cranach and his school, in which we repeatedly find representations of the evangelist writing in his study-cell, the angel at St. Matthew's side performs many other services, such as holding the inkwell, but only on this one print do we find the angel holding a mirror. The resemblance to the very unusual arrangement of the scene in Rembrandt's print is great. At the same time we are struck by a remarkable difference: in Cranach's woodcut we see the dove of the Holy Ghost, in Rembrandt's etching the monogram of Christ surrounded by magic words. This leads to the question - again put provisionally as part of a working hypothesis - who, in seventeenth century Am- sterdam, would have had reason to represent someone, a Christian theologist, as a second Luther, working under the inspiration of . . . now not the Holy Ghost but of what is for us still a somewhat mysterious anagram? In the theological undergrowth of seventeenth century sects in The Netherlands, Chiliasts, Quinto- monarchists, Cabbalistic Alchemists or Pansophists, Pre-Adamites and Rosicrucians21, there is one 19. There are other instances of such travesty portraits from this time and this circle. From 1525, also by Cranach, we know a painted portrait of Cardinal Albrecht von Brandenburg in his study 'as Saint Jerome' (Fig. 9). See M. Friedländer and J. Rosenberg, Die Gemälde von Lucas Cranach, Berlin 1932, PI. 157. For a woodcut after Cranach Melanchthon as St. Luke , here even with a true nimbus (Fig. 8) see: A. Schramm, Die Illustration der Lutherbibel , Leipzig 1923, Fig. 410 (cf. F. Buchholz, Protestantismus und Kunst im 16. Jahrhundert , Leipzig 1928 (Studien über christliche Denkmäler N.F.

The only group that seems consistent with such a sub- stitution is the antitrinitarian sect of the Socinians, whose teaching is summarized in a seventeenth century source thus : Les Sociniens nient la Divinité du Jesus-Christ, l'existence du Saint Esprit, le peché originel, la satisfaction de Jesus-Christ, la resurrection des méchans, le rétablissement des mesmes corps que les fidelles ont eu pendant leur vie dans le monde. Leurs as- semblées publiques sont deffenduës . . .22 For a proper understanding of our subject, I will give here only a few necessary highlights from the troubled history of this Protestant, antitrinitarian sect. The name is taken from two sixteenth century Sienese noblemen, uncle and nephew, of the Socini family who, after having left their country via Switzerland, finally found adherents in Poland and Transylvania. But by the beginning of the seven- teenth century these Socinians were persecuted in Poland too, and many went via Danzig to the free Republic of The Netherlands where they were known as Polish Brothers.23 Now, freedom is a relative concept, and their heretical, antitrinitarian teaching aroused fierce oppo- sition in the Republic as well. Dutch theologists even set them beyond the bounds of Christendom because, according to them, those who deny that either Jesus or any other being is God, did not deserve the name of Christians. The Staten (i.e. the governmental body) of several provinces repeatedly passed edicts against this 'blasphemous and pernicious' belief, and in the very years 1651/53 in which Rembrandt's print must be located, there was an intensification of this campaign against the Hydra Socinianismi, probably because around 1650 many different neo-reformational currents (including the Chiliastic) began to stir more and more audibly.24 In 1653 an edict against the 'Warsaw errors' threatened all Socinians with banishment and in 1655 it was demanded in a pamphlet ' . whether the heretics and particularly those called Socinians should not be punished ... by death'.25 pen 1961 (Aulaboeken) ; the best general review is still J.

Socianism was considered the most extreme deviation possible and a warning finger was raised: 'per Arminianismum gradatim in Socinianismum'. This may be the reason why as early as 1619 Bertius, one of the prosecuted Remonstrant preachers, defended himself before his judges with the sharp remark that he was 'nor Arrian, nor Socinian, nor Mohammedan'.26 In addition to the denial of the Divine Trinity, the fact that the Socinians refused to accept the substitutive satisfaction of Christ caused real horror. In the expression 'Christ died for us', the Soci- nians wanted to read 'for' not as 'instead of us' but 'to set an example for us'. Also, according to them God does not demand atonement, but wants to forgive. What Jesus did cannot benefit us unless we follow his example. Christ is not God's eternal Son but the Son of the eternal God :27 . . because the eternal Father blessed him so much more than other men and chose him alone from among all mankind as his one and only Son'. as a publication in 1654 cites their error with abhorrence.28 Meanwhile, as the edicts show, the doctrine spread. The familiar pattern repeated itself in this case too : the clergy complained again and again to the magistrate. The government, although adverse to intolerance in any form, was from time to time driven to carry out the measures wrung from it, in spite of its being generally convinced that an exemplary group of citizens was involved, exceptional precisely for the tolerance they preached,29 and who - unless provoked - caused no trouble whatsoever. In 1656, shocking heresies were imputed to the 'free-speaking' college of the Rijnsburgers. The elders and deacons of the Reformed church wrote to the burgomasters who - after some delay - turned the document over to the bailiff. The latter, after making an investigation, reported 'that the meetings of the Socinians were extremely quiet, only reading aloud a chapter of the Holy Scripture, unless ours (i.e. adherents of the Reformed faith) themselves made the first commotion there . . .'30 26.

This tolerance was an important point shared by various neo- Reformational groups. Samuel Przypkowski, one of the two Socinian Polish noblemen who came to Leiden in 1616 in the hope of making contacts there and of finding support for their fight against the Jesuits, published a book under the pseudonym of Irenaeus Philalethes in 1628 in Eleutheropolis [Amsterdam] entitled De pace et concordia ecclesiae , 'in which he attempted to demonstrate that differences in theological ideas did not give the right to exclude a man from salvation'.

Van Slee, op. cit. p. 265. 14</page><page sequence="10">I may now summarize my hypothesis : 1. Rembrandt's print, in its composition a variant of Cranach's Luther illustration, shows, compared with the latter, an essential difference in its substitution of a Christ-monogram for the Dove of the Holy Ghost. 2. No group comes closer to this theological content than the Socinians, persecuted even in the Republic of the United Provinces. This hypothesis is seen in a new light when it is known that Socinus the nephew, who died in 1604 in Poland, had the christian name of Faustus ; and the possibility of a representation of Dr. Faustus Socinus as a second Luther becomes still greater on reading in his epitaph that in the purging of the church - there described as the demolition of the 'Babylonian' building - Luther had been able to destroy the roof, Calvin the walls, but Socinus the foundations:31 Tota licet Babylon destruxit tecta Lutherus Calvinus muros, sed fundamenta Socinus. This is the reason why I can follow neither those who, on the grounds of its old title, link the print to the legendary Faust, nor those who wish to abandon the traditional title Dr. Faustus. If my propo- sition is correct, insiders would have had good reason to prefer not to indicate the print otherwise than as 'Dr. Faustus', sapienti sat.32 There was reason enough for caution! The program for the print (the title-page for a probably unpublished Socinian book?)33 might then have been as follows : to give an ideal-portrait of Faustus Socinus as a second Luther, contemplating Christ, the only man to have been admitted to the centre of the One and Only God. Lastly, I would like to point out that the acceptance of this solution need not imply that the other traditional title, namely The Practicing Alchemist must be rejected because no alchemistic instruments of any kind appear in Rembrandt's etching. In the first place, these 'alchemists' were much more than just chemists, and in the second, the Dutch colloquial language still employs the term 'prakkizeren' for pondering or thinking over. 31. For the lost inscription see: E. M. Wilbur, The grave and mo- nument of Faustus Socinus', Proceedings of the Unitarian Historical Society 4 (1936) and G. Pioli, Fausto Socino , [Modena] 1952, p. 663. A variant in O. Fock, Der Socinianismus , Kiel 1847, 1, p. 180: Alta ruit Babylon: destruxit tecta Lutherus ¡Muros Calvinus , sed funda- menta Socinus. 32. The similarity in name between the legendary alchemistic sor- cerer Faust and Dr. Faustus Socinus provided Vondel, in his attack on the Antitrinitarians, the following closing lines : 'Zoo ziet men V lout er woord van 7 schuim der ongodisten In assche en enckel roock en smooch veralchimisten' (So do we see the pure word alchimized into ash and smoke by the off- scum of the aetheists). Onderwijs van het geloofshooftpunt der H. Dryeenigheit (Tract of the cardinal doctrine of the Holy Trinity) (1659) in De Werken van Vondel (The Works of Vondel) vm Amst. 1935 p. 753, vs. 379/80. The commentary reports that Vondel coined this word veralchemisten 'undoubtedly under the influence of Socinus' given name of Faust with its immediate association with the sorcerer Dr. Johannes Faustus, known in Holland through popular books and prints, by Rembrandt among others'. Cf. Vondel-Kroniek 6 (1935), p. 184. The Socinian poet mentioned in note 49, Joachim Oudaan, opposed Vondel; C. C. Bruin, Joachim Oudaan in de lijst van zijn tijd (Joachim Oudaan in the framework of his time), Groningen 1955, p. 13. The same play on words occurs in a caricature by Romeyn de Hooghe with the inscription '. . . Faustus van Straetsburg' in a pamphlet en- titled Den Franschen Algemist , 1674 (Fig. 3) (Muller, Hist. pl. 2528; Koninkl. Bibi. Den Haag, Cat. Pamfletten 1 1 175). 33. For more concerning the production of Socinian works, see note 40. The large, eight-folio edition of 1656, the Bibliotheca Fratrum Polono - rum contains a conventional portrait of Faustus Socinus.

Národni Museum, Warsaw 1959. 15</page><page sequence="11">Our research has reached a point from which many roads lead in many directions. Which Socinian worked with Rembrandt for the realization of this etching is impossible to determine at the moment. Among the scholars the first to be mentioned should be the scholar Adam Boreel, versed in Hebrew, scion of a distinguished family who lived for some time as a hermit in a hut and of whom it was said that he had thrown away great sums of money in attempting to find the philosopher's stone. In 1636 Rembrandt was the neighbour of another member of this family.34 But more important seems to be the agreement in interest in Judaism. Boreel supported such undertakings as Menasseh ben Israel's edition of the Mischna and the building of the famous model of Salomon's temple by Jacob Juda Leon.35 He himself applied in 1646 for a patent for a Talmud edition that was never published, and he seems to have translated the Mischna into Latin, a translation which Worthington in 1660 hoped him to publish ' . . it would be for the use of Christians, that hereby might be better instructed to deal with the Jews'. Crossley, the publisher of Worthington's diary and letters, came to the conclusion: 'There is no doubt Boreel was a Socinian'.36 Paul Felgenhauer, who called himself the only true opponent of Socinianism, reports among his discussions with followers of that doctrine one dispute with Adam Boreel (1654).37 Boreel devoted himself with much industry and expense, but with little success, to the conversion of the Jews; he also established together with others in Amsterdam, around 1645, a 'free-speaking college' modelled on the Rijnsburger group which had already taken on something of the odour of Socinianism.38 A copy of his anonymously published Ad legem et ad testimonium carries on its fly-leaf the annotation: 'Auctor huius libri est Adamus Boreel, estque valde impius'.39 Among the printers, the famous Willem Jansz. Blaeu was generally known as a man with Socinian sympathies. 'It is the Blauwe press', says an adversary of the doctrine in 1638, 'which publishes all kinds of Remonstrant and Socinian works'.40 Amsterdam was the world centre of Socinian book production, these publications carry however the most divergent, but telling indications such as Irenopolis , Eleutheropolis , Kosmopolis , Stauropolis , Rakow, Colonia , Gouda (understand Golden city), Vredestadt (Peace city), Vrijstadt (Free city), Vriburg , Waerstad (Truth city).41 34.

Welcker, as Dr. Joan Blaeu (not Cornelius as Wegner states). Compositionally, this drawing (now in Leiden, Printroom of the Uni- versity) has just as much and just as little to do with Rembrandt's Faust etching as the many other seventeenth century representations of a Scholar (cf. notes 69 and 78). The same holds for the title-pages of sixteenth century French Nostra- damus publications reproduced by Wegner, {op. cit., p. 21). 41. A comparative study of the typographical material used in these works would probably be fruitful. 16</page><page sequence="12">But many other names besides those of Boreel and Blaeu could be mentioned. As far as a possible commission is concerned, it is well to keep in mind that in Poland Socinianism had spread above all among the nobility, and that in The Netherlands too its followers came from among the more pros- perous, intellectual upper layer of society. In this respect there was, notwithstanding their ideological resemblance, a distinct difference between the Socinians and the Mennonites. Spiritually these Socinians and the Mennonites may have been related, but in name and position the difference between them was immense. Jan Trijpmaker (Velvetmaker), Gerrit Boekbinder, Hans de Wever (Weaver), Dirk Kuiper (Cooper), Jeroen Tinnegieter (Pewterer) and others like them, how sharply they contrast with the Moskorzowskis, the Lubienickis, the Wiszo- watys, the Sieninskis, all knights and barons and at the same time spokesmen for Socinianism. One has only to compare the handwriting of Mennonites of those times with that of these Socinians to see at once the difference between the men of the people and the Polish nobility with their beautiful script'.42 But regardless of who commissioned this etching, I have shown in another article that later in his life Rembrandt had been found ready to accept a politically dangerous commission. I was able to make clear, from his relations with Menasseh ben Israel, that he in any case enjoyed the confidence of those who, because of their idealistic convictions, set themselves apart from accepted political or theological patterns and precepts.43 If we juxtapose what we know of these Socinians and what we begin to see more and more clearly of Rembrandt's deep, undogmatic belief, it becomes probable that he was looked on if not as a fellow believer then at least as a trustworthy sympathizer. It also seems to me that, for example, the sphere of extreme tolerance44 that characterized Socinia- nism, as well as the spirit of 'semi-Judaizantism'45 of which the Socinians were accused, agree remark- ably well with that we otherwise know of Rembrandt's life and work. 'Er findet es jedenfalls in den Jahren um 1648 ganz selbstverständlich, dass Christus, da er ein Jude war, ein jüdisches Gesicht haben muss'.46 Rotermund thinks that the models for the series of heads of young Jews (or studies for a head of Christ) were exclusively Portugese Jews, more specially 'Rabbinenschiiler'.47 42.

This Messianic work was in certain points a reply to Felgenhauer's Bonum Nuncium Israelis (see note 24 and compare Schoeps, Philosemi- tismus , p. 21). 44. In Servetus we already see the combination of Antitrinitaria- nism and tolerance that was to become a salient characteristic of Soci- nianism (cf. notes 27 and 29). It would require a separate study to investigate to what extent Rem- brandt's etching The Phoenix is related to the death at the stake and the fame of this great predecessor of the Antitrinitarians. 45. Speaking about Poland and Transylvania, Harnack went so far as to mention 'Abspaltungen, die von dem Nonadorantismus bis zur Grenze des Judenthums erfolgten' Dogmengeschichte4 in, p. 782.

Was Rembrandt a Socinian? Did he find the way to this human Christ, impelled by feelings like those of, for instance, the poet Joachim Oudaan who 'liever met Serveet wou branden aan een staak ' (would rather burn with Servetus at the stake) than accept the doctrine of the Trinity that was con- trary to God's Word49 or the theologian and poet Dirk Camphuysen who, unable to resolve the prob- lem of the inclemency of the official doctrine concerning the fate of unbelievers, transcended this crisis by means of the doctrine of Socinus? '. . . for the insight given on this point (since I could not reach it with by my own mind), at a moment when I was about to reject the Christian Religion, caused me to love that same religion, to prize it, find it rational and to experience it vigorously by God's mercy up to this very moment.'50 The question of whether Rembrandt was a Socinian is for various reason not susceptible of a direct answer. Not the least of these is the fact that the Socinians in The Netherlands, because of the opposi- tion and persecution they experienced, never emerged as a separate group. On the other hand, their doctrines worked as a leaven in all those pious groups which existed without connections with the official church, such as the later Rijnsburg collegians.51 But the various nuances of Mennonism (i.e. Anabaptism) also included similar concepts of anti-confessionalism and general tolerance with respect to widely divergent religious convictions.52 Van Slee writes of the Mennonites in his history of Socinianism in the Netherlands : 'Complete agreement with the doctrinal theses of Socinus is thus not found in any of them. The Mennonites did not put them- selves jointly or severally responsible for the feelings of Socinus . . .' 'But the bad odour attached to it did not prevent many from accepting what they found true and good in the religious standpoint and the theological views of the Polish Brothers.' '. . . they did not lack for men with a clear head who, as experienced preachers and educated laymen, learned to understand through the Socinians that especially the Athanasian Christology and the church doctrine of satisfaction were injurious to the practice of the Christian piety that concerned them first and foremost'.53 48.

If we were to distinguish only eccle- siastical organizations and religious sects, this important trend would easily escape us, a trend represented by figures of various religious plumage, just as we find them represented in the small group of people who, as we may assume, formed Rembrandt's circle of friends' (our transi.).

Van Slee, op. cit., p. 197. 54. W. J. van Douwen, op. cit., p. 79. 18</page><page sequence="14">Concerning this solace found by some in the ideas of Socinus, Van Douwen quotes a Mennonite pronouncement in which the old meaning of the word 'hertog' (duke), i.e. he who marches in front of the army, can still be felt : "Christ died thus only because he was made a hertoge of salvation of all those who set the seal upon justice even, if necessary, with their death.'54 On the basis of this and other pronouncements, Van Douwen concluded: '. . . all doubt concerning the existence of Socinian opinions among the Mennonites in this country is removed for those who have become aware of . . .55 At the request of the four classes of the Reformed Church in the Province of Zeeland, the Staten of Zeeland decided in 1655 '. . . to be on guard in good time against the gross and dangerous errors of the Socinians, which seem to creep in par- ticularly among the Mennonites'.56 Seen in this light, the only contemporary reference of which we know concerning Rembrandt's be- liefs takes on a new content. Rotermund has pointed out that Baldinucci, in the well-known passage about Rembrandt's religion, uses in his Cominciamento (1686) the popular term 'Mennist' instead of the official Mennonite, and this form indicates a local, oral tradition, thus increasing its credibility.57 This evidence, however, does not imply that we must necessarily consider Rembrandt to have been a member of one of the Mennonite groups. Mennist was the general term used for everything more to the left than the Remonstrants ; it was also often a blanket term used to cover the worst possible ele- ment, in other words Socinianism. When, around the middle of the century, the Reformed clergy complained to the magistrate about the Socinian teaching which they thought detected among the above mentioned 'college of Rijnsburgers' in Amsterdam, established among others by Adam Boreel, they received the answer that it 'was an assembly of Mennists'.58 The Utrecht professor J. Hoornbeek, who attacked Socinianism in a series of publications, was the author of an oft-repeated adage : Anabaptista indoctus Socinianus, Socinianus autem doctus Anabaptista.59 The particularities indicated by Rotermund in Rembrandt's Biblical scenes, especially those be- longing to the 1640's, are, as it were, a reflection of some of the principal Socinian concepts.60 On the 55.

Michel ( Oud-Holland 1890) it is assumed that the Danish painter Bernard Keihl, who worked from 1642 to 1644 as pupil in Rembrandt's studio and lived in Rome after 1651, was Baldinucci's source of information. In this connection attention may be called to a penetrating article by Wijnman, who points out the intense influence to which Rembrandt must have been exposed in his early years in Amsterdam from the Mennonite milieu he encountered in the shop of the art dealer Hen- drick Uylenburgh (the 'famosa accademia') where the young artist lived between 1631 and 1635.

How vague the borderlines were and to what extent these ideas were linked with the development which we can follow in Rembrandt's representations of Christ emerges from the following quotation: 'The „foreign fire" burned on. Socinianism, the new doctrine of Outerman and his followers, gripped the Mennonite world. Its attraction lay in the guarantee of salvation which it offered ... [to those] ... of whom the preacher Alutarius scornfully said that they found no consolation in living and dying but sighed uneasily: Ah, what shall we do? Oh, might I be saved! These were the people for whom Socinianism provided firm ground on which to stand by its teaching that the Crucified One was purely a man.61 When it had been their experience that the belief in a resurrected God gave no certainty, no consolation, then their soul reached out that much more joyfully . . . towards the light of the candelabrum held high by foreign hands, for it brought the disappearance of the dark spot which had made them fearful . . . Nor can there be any doubt that the authors of the anonymous Socinian works cited above must be sought among the Mennonites . . . These Flemings [a sect of the Mennonites] continued to disguise their connection with the heretics. But the time would come when the Socinianism among the Mennonites was preached in full awareness.'62 This Socinianistic concept of a Christ who was 'purely a man' is completely in agreement with the characteristic ascribed by recent investigators to the later, non-Italianized and non-heroic type of Christ as it began to develop with Rembrandt after 1640. '. . . die Gestalt Christi ... ist nichtmehr aus Vorlagen entlehnt. Christus is hier voll einbezogen in den Realismus der Rem- brandtschen Kunst. Das bedeutet nach der inhaltlichen Seite hin : es ist jeder Versuch aufgegeben, die Gestalt Christi zu idealisieren ; das Geheimnis Christi dadurch zum Ausdruck zu bringen, dass man den Menschen Jesus vergöttlicht, heroisiert'.63 'Es bricht vom Beginn der Vierzigerjahre eine andere Vorstellung von Christus durch . . . die in Christus nicht nur den Magier sieht, sondern einen, der auf die stillste, mildeste Art gütig und verzeihend . . . auf die Menschen wirkt, sie fast mehr durch sein beispielhaftes Verhalten allein zu beeinflussen trachtet (Italics mine). . . . jene spätere Vorstellung . . . von dem gütigen, erhöhten, hilfsbereiten Gott-Menschen, Menschen-Gott, der zwischen den andern steht, mit ihnen lebt. Das Emmausmahl in Paris, von 1648, zeigt Christus . . . völlig als armen, irdischen Menschen mit einem jüdischen Gesicht voll Demut und Leid.'64 * * * 3) no Paul-scenes in the drawings. 4) no Apocalypse, no eschatology. Rotermund concludes: 'Fasst man diese Momente zu einem theologi- schen Gesamtbild zusammen, so steht man etwa vor der Anschauungs- welt der Socinianer. Es wurde oben ausgeführt, wie socinianische Ge- danken in die doopsgezinden Gemeinden eingeströmt waren, und wie innerlich ungeschützt diese Gemeinden von ihren eigenen Vorausset- zungen her gegen dieses Unterströmt- werden waren. Das heisst nun nicht, dass Rembrandt 'Socinianer' war. Er wird ver- mutlich wenig Sinn für die Auseinandersetzungen für und wider den Socinianismus gehabt haben, von denen die 50er Jahre erfüllt waren. Aber es könnte bedeuten, dassTtembrandt in einer Anschauungswelt wurzelte, die im Geheimen und vielleicht sich selbst unbewusst soci- nianisch beeinflusst war . . H. M. Rotermund, Ned. Kunsthistorisch Jaarboek (1952/53) p. 140. 61. How this term a 'puer' man (i.e. purely a man) must be under- stood, namely as entirely a human being, may be seen from the follow- ing quotation : 'Thus the Son of God lost his first nature completely and changed to a mortal man of flesh and blood. The poverty of Christ thus consisted not only in the lack of earthly treasure, honour and glory, but also in the laying aside of the divine form, glory, wisdom, all- knowingness, immortality, his divine kingdom.

Rembrandt's unique Faustus etching, which at first sight seems to stand entirely isolated even in the whole body of the master's work, forms on closer inspection a striking example of this power. This side of his work, the relation with the general traditions of the history of art, has been unjustifiably neglected by almost all previous authors. This misled them into interpreting - as though they were unique - many details in Rembrandt's composition which were actually entirely traditional. Recent investigations have shown that the Christ monogram is surrounded by magic charms of a traditional nature, but these earlier investigators had in several respects lost sight of the fact that other, formal, traditions are also involved. The representation of The scholar in his study65 has a long tradition in pictorial art. With respect to our subject it is of importance that it was in Leiden, probably under the influence of the young Univer- sity, that this centuries-old theme had gone through a particular development just before Rembrandt was asked to make his variant of Cranach's woodcut. In Rembrandt's oeuvre the influence can be seen, from the very beginning, of the Vanitas type of still-life with books, as first handled in Leiden in the studio of David Bailly.66 As the best-known examples we may mention: The Moneychanger (1627, Berlin, Br. 420), The Disputing Scholars (1628, Melbourne, Br. 423)67 and the drawing in the Louvre, formerly also sometimes attributed to Dou (Ben. 46). In the remarkable piece A scholar in a high room in London (± 1628, Br. 427)68, which already foreshadows something of the Faust, the general genre element of the representation and the importance of the chiaroscuro predominate over the still- life (Fig. 1 8) ; the Man sharpening his pen, at present generally attributed to Lievens, represents a somewhat more academic phase of this type (Fig. 20); in Rembrandt's painting of 1634, a Scholar in Eastern Dress (Prague, Br. 432) the representation approaches portrait allure. The Faust etching represents the mid-point between these diverse possibilities. 65. The Faust print may be considered not only as a variant of the iconographical groups, analysed below, of St. Matthew and other writing saints such as St. Jerome (Cf. note 72), St. Gregory (Cf. note 82), and St. Ambrosius (and in general of inspired writers), but also as belonging to the historical portrait to which Rembrandt's Aristotle (1653, New York, Metr. Mus, Br. 478) among others, also belongs. See: J. Rosenberg, 'Rembrandt and Guercino', Art Quarterly 7 (1944) pp. 129-134; H. von Einem, 'Rembrandt und Homer', Wallraf-Ri - chart z- Jahrbuch 14 (1952) p. 188; U. Christoffel, 'Barocke Philosophen- köpfe', Die Kunst 52 (1954) p. 281 . An indépendant theme within this genre is formed by Democritus and Heraclitus. See W. Weisbach, 'Der Sogenannte Geograph von Velaz- quez und die Darstellungen des Demokrit und Heraklit', Jahrbuch der preussischen Kunstsammlungen 49 (1928) p. 141. 66. W. Martin, De Hollandsche schilderkunst in de zeventiende eeuw2, Amsterdam 1942, i, p. 414. J. Bruyn points out in his article 'David Bailly', Oud-Holland 66 (1951) p. 2253, that with respect to style Rembrandt went his own way from the very beginning. K. Bauch, Der frühe Rembrandt und seine Zeit , Berlin 1960, pp. 21 and 248, argues that these Leiden still-lifes changed as soon as Rembrandt's activity commenced. Cf. note 72. See also I. Bergström, Dutch still-life painting in the seven- teenth century , London 1956, p. 158. 67. See for this subject ( Elias and Elisa ?, Democritus and Hippocra- tes or Heraclitus ?) Bauch, Der frühe Rembrandt , p. 259, note 106. Still more importance is given to the still-life of books (with a skull!) in a remarkable painting marked D.P. 1629 in a private collection in Budapest (Fig. 22), which entirely ignores Rembrandt's concept of chiaroscuro. An anonymous painting of a later date of An Astronomer , is indeed Rembrandtesque. (1946 artdealer, Switzerland (Fig. 23). 68.

Köninck in the Van Beuningen collection (Cat. 1949, nr. 55, Fig. 85) (see Fig. 24) represents a good average of what might be expected in this genre in the seventeenth century. It is important to take this into account, because in his etching Rembrandt chose the standpoint rather close to the table ; thus his composition became less comprehensive (a fact which in some instances has led to incorrect inter- pretations of certain components).74 As far as Rembrandt's own development is concerned, this leads via the so-called St. Anastasius (1631, Stockholm, Br. 430) and The Philosopher (1633, Louvre, Br. 431)75 to the etching St. Jerome of 164276 (Fig. 19) which, aside from the crucifix belonging to the theme, may be considered in its arrange- ment and requisites as the direct precursor of the Faust etching.77 The important difference lies in the point that in these works and many similar ones not discussed here,78 the scholar is engrossed in his book in some and in others either looks musingly into space or benevolently returns the spectator's regard. The unique point in Rembrandt's Faust etching is the attention directed elsewhere than to the books, combined with the standing posture of the scholar (the Lievens etching Fig. 37 being the only other instance known to us in which the scholar is not seated). In this respect there is also a striking difference from the quietly writing St. Matthew by Cranach. (Fig. 5). To comprehend this difference we shall have to clarify for ourselves what modifications certain aspects of the St. Matthew iconography had undergone under the influence of the general develop- ments in style since Cranach's time. In addition, we must not neglect significant changes in contem- porary conceptions of 'inspiration'. 69. A list of some works of art derived from Rembrandt's represen- tations of the theme A scholar in his study is given in Appendix 3. 70. Of Lievens we note the remarkable small print, formerly as- cribed to Rembrandt, shown in Fig. 37 (B. 146, Rovinsky, Atlas , sub. Rembrandt 416). 71 . From the start Dou ignored all the possibilities for using chiaro- scuro offered by the subject. His scholars are not always elderly, they are sometimes students, some playing music, as for example The flute- player , 1636, London, Lord Carysfort (Martin, Kl.d.K. p. 82; exhib. London 1952/3 nr. 153) and The violinist , 1637, London, Earl of Elles- mere (Martin, Kl.d.K. p. 85 ; cat. Bridgewater House 1907, nr. 244). Also worth mentioning, the drawing of a Man sharpening his pen , Am- sterdam, Fodor (Cat. Leiden 1956, Rembrandt als leermeester , nr. 104 with figs, and lit.). 72. W. Weisbach, Rembrandt , Berlin 1926, pp. 144 ff. Of the immediate predecessors we may mention : Lastman's Hermits (Freise nrs. 94-97a), the print series The seven sages of Greece by Jac. de Gheyn hi (Hollstein nr. 10-17 ; repr. Bauch, Der frühe Rembrandt p. 144) and a very unusual upward-looking, inspired, writing man by D. Bailly 1635, Göttingen, cat. 1926, nr. 4 described as A priest. Still earlier is a typically Leiden St. Jerome , first half of the sixteenth century initialed G.I. or I.G., in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, (Jaar- verslag 1956, p. 11). (Our Fig. 43).

A skull and globe occur on almost all of them 38</page><page sequence="33">In these respects the iconography of the Evangelist Matthew offers room for more possibilities than that of the other Evangelists. The reason for this lies in the fact that the latter's attributes are animals, while according to tradition, St. Matthew is accompanied by an angel in human form (or, if that other formulation is preferred, a winged man).79 The development of the representation of the Evangelists shows two poles which were initially still separate : a) either they are shown occupied as writers, sometimes working under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost (this line of devel- opment connects with the iconography of the Church Fathers, and was later to extend to the Renaissance genre of the Scholar in his study). b) or they are shown not as writers but as see-ers for whom the heavens open and to whom the All-Highest is revealed (this line - in no sense younger, as shown for instance by the Ottonic Evangelist miniatures80 - debouches into the iconography of ecstacy and divine rapture which developed especially in the Baroque period). With respect to the type mentioned under b), the important question is how, in the course of time, the realization of this visionary condition was arrived at. Initially - as can be seen clearly in the Ottonic examples - light formed the trait d'union between the Deity revealing itself and him to whom the vision appeared. Indeed, the abstraction often goes so far that a ray of light is the only indication of the Inexpressible.81 At the same time, concrete messengers often appear, and it is at this point of development that the abovementioned, so to speak 'built-in' advantages of the iconography of the Evangelist Matthew could appear to full advantage.82 As early as the middle ages we see that the angel accompanying Matthew points out something in the book with his finger83 (Fig. 26, 27 and 29).

Consideration must also be given to an influence by representa- tions of St. Gregory, namely the story of his being inspired by the dove of the Holy Ghost and of his curious ' notarius ' deacon Peter. The compendium Rudimentum novitiorum (ed. Lucas Brandis, Lübeck 1475) contains a woodcut of an ecclesiastic without nimbus with a dove on his shoulder, the frequently repeated indication for the column of the scholars. L.

Cranach, in his unique manner of representing inspiration via a mirror held by an angel, draws on a rather domesticated, medieval, lesser branch of this development : in numerous representations the angel no longer fulfils an important, inspirational func- tion (like pointing with the hand or directing the pen) but contents himself, as a kind of chamber attendant, with holding the inkpot or the book from which the evangelist is transcribing85 (Fig. 5). In short, there is still no sign in Cranach's work of what would soon in Italian art be indicated as : S. Matteo in colloquio con l'angelo inspiratore. The theme of the intervening genius had, in the Middle Ages - how could it have been otherwise - taken on an ambivalent character: there are angels who help the scholarly saint and there are devils who come to distract and disturb him. In most cases the reaction shown is, for modern ideas, improbably small. But in such cases it is anachronistic to attempt to read a psychological reaction into the features or gestures ; each of the dramatis personae is acting his own separate part: the writer writes, the angel points, the devil pulls the book away, and thus what was be told was told clearly. There was as yet no question of one integrated situation in which all the figures are involved, each in his way. In this phase the differences between the actors are still more important than what they have in common. In the representation of a happening, a common focus was as little known as general perspective subordination in the representa- tion of space. To limit ourselves now to the angel, two possibilities soon developed, one of them directed to a concrete and the other to a more abstract contact. In the first case the angel commands, in the second he gesture towards Elsewhere. 84. For classical antiquity see : K. Schefold, Die Bildnisse der anti- ken Dichter , Redner und Denker , Basel 1943 (spec. p. 168 for the type: Schüler der Musen) ; O.

Winternitz, The inspired musician, a 16th century musical pastiche', Burlington Magazine 100 (1958) p. 48 and G. Bandmann, Melancholie und Musik, Köln 1960, p. 120. It is remarkable that the iconography of the Evangelist St. Luke as a painter has led to so few representations of inspiration. There seem to be several reasons for this. Traditionally, writing was a sublime calling and painting merely a craft. Then again, formal demands for a second figure led more easily in the case of a writer to the introduction of such a second figure, representing inspiration, than in the case of a painter where the second figure was naturally constituted by the model. In the representations of St. Lucas painting , such a second figure (the posing Madonna) was given by the subject itself. One of the few instances of a Saint Luke painting under the guidance of an angel is the painting by Jan Gossaert in Vienna (Friedländer 23, ± 1520).

Schnellboltz, Wittenberg 1563. 40</page><page sequence="35">The most important junction between the old and newer times lies - as so often in these matters - in the art of Caravaggio, whose realism led (in both versions of the Evangelist Matthew for San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome) to solutions which are dia- metrically opposite to the naturalism of Courbet, who said that he indeed could not paint an angel because he had never seen one. It was Rembrandt's great contribution that he was able to transform Caravaggio's chiaroscuro from a realistic, one might almost say rhetorical, technique into a means of spiritual evocation. In the art of the Contra-Reformation, especially after Caravaggio, the saints more and more begin to show a reaction, and especially a more emotional reaction, to the angel's gesture towards the dis- tance. Now it is no longer the devils whose function it is to disturb; in the Baroque period the theme of interruption was henceforth to be assigned in the first place to the angels. Their warning has become a summons; instead of demonstrating, they startle; and in the pious objects of their concern, quiet contemplation is replaced by devout rapture and ecstacy.86 Most important to our investigation is, lastly, that manner of arranging the scene in which the source of the interruption comes to lie outside the painting. In the Caravaggiesque painting The Vision of St. Hieronymus in Worcester, the startled reaction of the saint is the predominating motif (Fig. 34) ; the necessity for an intervening figurant no longer exists. A good example of the pre-Caravaggiesque phase is found in Benozzo Gozzoli's St. Augustine hearing the voice of St. Hiero- nymus, San Giminiano, Sant'Agostino Fig. 25.87 The St. Hieronymus looking up from his work (1618) by Juan de Ribalta (1596-1628) may be considered as a Latin counter- part of Rembrandt's etching, (Fig. 31)88, and for its feeling for the interior as well, whereas the St. Gregorius by a South- Netherlands Caravaggist (Mathias Stomer?) in Basel is limited to the expression of a rather trite effect of fright (Fig. 35).89 In the work of the French Caravaggist Jacques Blanchard (1600-1638) this theme is reduced to a general attention to something located outside the painting which inspirationally directs the writer's hand (see Fig. 32). Nevertheless, there remains a certain lack of unity in the attention. Only El Greco's San Ildefonso (ca. 1600; Illescas, Hospital of Charity) is in its high quality a worthy counterpart to Rembrandt's portrayal of interrupted activity and inspired contemplation (Fig. 45)90. Rembrandt's solution lies between the two possibilities : the interruption was considerable (so much so that the scholar has risen from his chair) but a new concentration has been formed and is directed entirely to the main point: the numen (Fig. p. 6). The extreme manner of representation of the vision, i.e. solely by radiance, had already been ap- plied by Rembrandt in his composition of the Christ at Emmaus which has not survived but of which a drawing in Cambridge (Fitzwilliam Museum) gives an impression.91 In this respect too, the Faust 86.

This was the form that Rembrandt was to finally find in the St. Matthew he painted in 1661 (Louvre, see Fig. 30).93 Considered from this point of view, the difference between the two representations by Cranach and Rembrandt can be seen as the difference between the methods of composing of the Renaissance and the Baroque. In the woodcut by Cranach (Fig. 5) there is a paratactic manner of representation: on one side the Circle with the Dove of the Holy Ghost (in or outside the room?), on the other the learned translator who without looking up concentrates on his work, and in between, like a piece of furniture placed in a corner, the angel with his mirror. In Rembrandt's etching the principal elements are related to each other, but in addition, the all- penetrating pious dread of the Italian examples has become - could it be more reformational? - a direct, intense contemplation. An unceasing current of spiritual feeling flows back and forth between the Deity revealing itself and the beholder,94 and here too the intermediary has become superfluous. schichte 3 (1934) p. 337 and J.

A drawing from the school of Rembrandt shows a Scholar , startled by a winged angel descending in his study (repr. Old Master Drawings 13-6-1929, advertisement E. Parsons &amp; Sons and cat. sale Hamburg 7-6-1958 nr. 15). Besides these art-historical traditions, it is of importance to recall that in Rembrandt's time there were those among the 'Stepchildren of Christendom' who could testify to visionary experiences (see Linde- boom, op. cit., p. 353 on Johan Rothe who in 1652, wandering through the Hague Woods, had a vision in which God accepted him as man- servant ; see Hylkema, Reformateurs ii 409 on the visionary Joh. George Gichtel). 4 Wirklich kann man nicht lang in Böhmes Schriften lesen, ohne an Rem- brandt und seine Lichtproblemen denken zu müssen', Neumann, Rem- brandt* h, p. 691, cf. also p. 671. 93. Weisbach ,who emphasizes the alchemistic element in the print, has intuitively felt the relation to the St. Matthew. 'In wieweit sie [the Faust-etching] ... in einem tieferen Sinne religiös gemeint war, können wir nicht ermessen, aber sie ist als Vorspiel zu unserer Betrachtung der religiösen Bildnisse wohl am Platze'. (Weisbach, Rembrandt , p. 577). The theme of The whispered prompting also occurs as early as a paint- ing, dated 1656, by B. Fabritius (Fig. 33) (D. Pont , Barent Fabritius 1624-1673 , Den Haag 1958, nr. 22). In his review of this book (Kunst- chronik 12 (1959), p. 290), W. Sumowskihas supposed a disappeared Rembrandt drawing (preparatory study to Rembrandt's painting in the Louvre, 1661) to have been the source not only for Fabritius' conposition but also for a St. Matthew by Eeckhout (1670, formerly coll. Hofstede de Groot). A painting clearly inspired by Rembrandt's St. Matthew , attributed to Carel Fabritius, in Raleigh, North Carolina, Museum of Art. 94. The shift of the inspiration from the realm of hearing to that sight seems typically Dutch. Kauffmann has sketched the general development by which in the Low Countries the depiction of sight as one of the senses and the representations of the Scholar gradually merged. The program of the Faust print is based on a spiritualization of this theme. H. Kauffmann, Kunstgeschichtliche Studien für Dagobert Frey , 1943, p. 154 (cited by Wegner, Faustdarstellung p. 26). A typically old-fashioned, South-Netherlands and Catholic depiction of inspiration is seen in the print St. Theresa writing by A. Collard and C. Galle (C. Emond, 'L'iconographie carmélitaine dans les anciens Pays-Bas méridionaux', Mémoires Ac. Roy . de Belgique 12, fase. 5 (1961) p. 166, Fig. 69). Probably under the influence of the theories of Bojanowski and his followers, Kauffmann considers the mirror as 'Symbol der Selbster- kenntnis'. For the magic meaning, which he also supports, see in general: G. F. Hartlaub, Zauber des Spiegels , München 1951 and idem in : Reallexikon zur deutschen Kunstgeschichte iv (1958) col. 90, s.v. Divination. See also: H. Schwarz, 'The mirror in art', The art quarterly 15 (1952) pp. 97-118; idem, 'The mirror of the artist and the mirror of the devout', Studies in the history of art dedicated to William E. Suida , 1959, p. 90. In my opinion, the entire disposition of the luminous disk and the mir- ror suggest the cabbalistic methaphor in which the two kinds of human knowledge (extraordinary knowledge and ordinary knowledge) were called the Luminous Mirror and the Non-luminous Mirror (C. D. Ginsburg, The Esse snes, their history and doctrines; The Kabbalah, its doctrines , development and literature, London ed. 1955, p. 119. The pear-shaped white form on the window-frame belongs to the realia 42</page><page sequence="37">Nevertheless, closer examination shows that there was once a figure near the window with head slightly bent, originally holding the mirror. The reason for the removal of this angel can only be guessed at (both theological and esthetic reasons could be found), but it may safely be stated once again that this figure is one of the strongest arguments for a relation between the prints of Rembrandt and Cranach. Under the pointing hand there is even still another repentir visible: an extended index finger coming vertically from below. This smaller hand belongs in all probability to the original angel borrowed from Cranach (Fig. 14). We may ask why Rembrandt did not remove this figure completely when it became superfluous. In my opinion, the answer is to be found in the esthetic sphere : just as with the bundle of papers to the left of the window, he needed half-tints here between the light near the window and the shadow on both sides of it.95 We have referred above (in connection with the location of the radiance with the Dove of the Holy Ghost) to the lack of coherence in the spatial composition of Cranach's woodcut; this can also be observed elsewhere in his print ; the extreme application of perspective in the disposition of the furni- ture in the foreground contrasting with the a-spatial treatment of the elements in the background (landscape, dove, angel) (Fig. 5). Rembrandt's interior, on the other hand, shows a far greater unity. This is the more striking because Weisbach was correct in his indication of a number of incoherent and incorrect elements in the spatial construction.96 of the room : it is a wrought-iron ring used for opening and closing the window. These rings are usually round, but they are also known in the pear-shape. Rembrandt must have chosen the latter to avoid any asso- ciation with the circle of the anagram and the (foreshortened) round mirror. 95. '. . . er läszt den Betrachter mit der Person selbst ins Fenster sehen, so daß das Auge, geblendet, keine festen Konturen, keine Model- lierungen im Raum sich rundender Dinge erfaßt, sondern nur durch Kontrast gesteigerte Dunkelheiten, in denen die vom geblendeten Auge überall hingetragenen Lichtflecken herumtanzen und alle Per- spectiven und Formen verunklären. Am schönsten ist dies Geflimmer hinter Faust an dem Wust gestapelter Bücher und Manuskripte gegeben, ein Chaos, aus dem der magische Stern geboren wird. Auch die Ge- stalt des Faust selber ist in dieser Flächentechnik konturlos und selbst wie ein Licht aufleuchtend gezeichnet, was durch die Immaterialität der Erscheinung der Geistigkeit seines Wesens und dem visionären Charak- ter des ganzen Blattes zugute kommt'. R. Hamann, Rembrandt , Berlin 1948, p. 339. 'It was no easy task for the etcher to display this phenomenon against the brightness of the window. But Rembrandt knew how to create a supernatural light effect within a natural one, producing intensity wherever he needed it, through contrast with the immediate surround- ings', J. Rosenberg, Rembrandt , Cambridge Mass. 1948, p. 157. 96. 'Dabei ist der Künstler in der Konstruktion des Räumlichen, in der Anlage und Scheidung der Teile mit grosser Willkür verfahren, so dass man sich erst bei eingehender Betrachtung allmählich zurecht- findet. Der Boden zwischen Tisch und Fenster ist vom Standpunkt zeichnerischer Richtigkeit under den gegebenen Verhältnissen verfehlt, der Tisch ein unmögliches Möbel, die Placierung der Gestalt innerhalb ihrer Umgebung so nicht denkbar: ihr linker Arm klebt mit dem am Boden aufliegenden Fenstervorhang zusammen. Was wollen aber sol- che 'Fehler' besagen gegenüber dem Wert und der dekorativen Schön- heit des Blattes als graphisches Kunstwerk!'. Weisbach, Rembrandt , p. 576/77. It is for various reasons impossible to agree with Weisbach and Roter- mund that the window is to be taken as a door (i.e. reaching to the floor and provided with glass over its whole length). 'Vermutlich geht die Tür ins Freie oder auf einen Balkon hinaus', Rotermund, 'Rembrandts Faust', Sammlung 1954, p. 282. That the table is probably to be taken as located near the window in these frequently vaulted rooms is shown by various works of art such as: the drawing alternately ascribed to Rembrandt and Lievens The foot operation in the Uffizi (Benesch I, 51) and two paintings The Eye operation (Healing of Tobias' father) formerly in the Aremberg collec- tion in Brüssel, now in Stuttgart (1636, Br. 502) and The parable of the workers in the vineyard in Leningrad (1637, Br. 558). For the general motif of a figure near a window that later, in the roman- tic period, was to have such a rich development, see: P. Wohlfarth, 'Die Frau am Fenster', Zeitschrift für Ästhetik und allgemeine Kunst- wissenschaft 31 (1937) spec. p. 66. 43</page><page sequence="38">The explanation is probably the same as that which I have proposed for the Syndics: having arrived at a certain point in the genetic process, questions of composition and visual balance on the flat surface weighed more heavily for Rembrandt than the strict demands of mathematical perspective.97 The case of the Faust etching is the more remarkable because here errors in perspective were made . . .for the sake of a more convincing rendition of the interior. In his youth Rembrandt developed the theme of 'die Gealterten innerhalb der Sphäre ihres geistigen Schaffens'. Bauch, who originated this phrase, notes that depictions of this theme by the master became infrequent in his later work.98 The older Rembrandt, working on his etching of Faustus Socinus, could draw on the experience he had accumulated with this theme of the meditating elderly men. But there was one important difference that was to distinguish this Dr. Faustus not only from the many interesting, beautifully lit 'character heads' done by Rembrandt and his imitators, but also from the Caravaggiesque representations of pious dread and rapture: compared with other works of art belonging to that traditional theme The inspired scholar, the value of the Faust print seems to lie in a subtle balance between interruption and concentration. (Translation Mrs. J. Seeger) The question of whether the radiance is inside or outside the room (H. M. Rotermund, op. cit.) is easily answered: the horizontal ray going to the left passes in front of the curtain ; the radiance is therefore in the room. In Rembrandt's Parable of the workers in the vineyard in Leningrad, we also see the rope which often hung down from the ceiling near this kind of window either because it served for hoisting up a basket (bird- cage) or for operating a hinged shutter attached to the ceiling. See also the entire situation on Th. Wijcks Alchimist at Mainz (cat. 1911, nr. 105) (Fig. 38) and many other similar paintings by this master. In the Faust etching there is a similar rope hanging slightly slanted near the window beside the bundle of papers. 97. H. van de Waal, 'De Staalmeesters en hun legende', (The Syn- dics and their legend), Oud-Holland 71 (1956), p. 82: 'Now for the first time our eyes open to the well-camouflaged attempts made by the very greatest artists (Donatello, Michelangelo, Titian, Rembrandt), long before Cézanne's, to escape from the sometimes too stringent compulsion of this mathematical system'. In my opinion the explanation of the short arm on the Anatomy Lesson by Dr. Tulp (The Hague, Mauritshuis) must be sought in this direction. These questions have been very clearly treated by W. R. Valentiner in his study 'Donatello and the medieval front plane relief', Studies of Italian Renaissance Sculpture , London 1950, p. 1. 98. K.

L. de Bruin has advanced a different solution in sev- eral articles in the Kroniek van de vriendenkring van het Rembrandt Huis (1961 and '62); according to him, the de- ciphered reading of the text is : IXRR SATAN LATET MATER LARGA TEGET adam DETEGAT lesu egemus AMEN In countering Rotermund's concept he points out, among other things, that the latter's proposed abbreviation tetrma for tetra-grammaton does not occur on amulets; on the other hand, his own reasoning neglects the meaningful term AG la which occurs twice in mirror-image. Against the spe- cial importance he ascribes to the Greek form of the E in T s in his deciphering, it must in our opinion weigh heavily that this and other peculiarities to which he ascribes signifi- cance (position of the cross, etc.) do not occur in the same form in the variants (cited i.a. by Rotermund and Ettlinger, cf. Fig. 16 text fig. p. 9) whose meaning must nevertheless Rembrandt's text. A word of warning from Michel de Bry (1953) against the method of shifting letters is cited by Wolthuis (p. 103): the letters of the name Vincent Auriol, the then outgoing president of France, can be combined in 1,556,755,200 dif- ferent ways, including a number of phrases which have meaning: 'II court en vain', 'L'Orient vaincu', 'Un certain viol', 'Cornu l'enviait' (Cornu was one of the candidates for the presidency). When the name is written in Hebrew letters, they can be combined into an anagram meaning: 'The right- eous bear the light'. Rotermund refers in the same respect and with the same warnings to H. Fuchs, 'Die Herkunft der Sartorformel', Schweiz. Archiv für Volkskunde Al (1951). We disagree entirely with De Bruin's proposed geometri- cal analysis and with his interpretation of the shadows to the right under the radiant cryptogram as 'a dark sitting figure' and of the shelves behind Faust as 'a nude woman' (difference in scale). Similar wall-shelves with papers are a set requisite in this genre; see, e.g. the situation on the Al- chemist by Th. Wijck (Fig. 38).

B. P. Lebrun, Galerie des Peintres li, Paris 1792, reprod. in Bauch, Der junge Rembrandt , p. 215 (Cf. p. 224, note 76). Also of interest is the small Rembrandtesque painting A scholar , marked Rembrandt f. 1632, in 1922 in the B. M. Greene collection, Toronto (Hofstede de Groot, Die hollän- dische Kritik der jetztigen Rembrandt-Forschung, 1922, p. 47 (48) ; see Fig. 36 and a drawing with the same subject (sale, Victor Koch, London, Sotheby 29-6-1949, nr. 98). Related in construction are five drawings not acknowl- edged by Benesch: Groningen, gift Hofstede de Groot (exh. cat. 1931, nr. 105); earlier London, Heseltine collec- tion (reproduced Bredius-bundel ; Fig. 102-7); Paris, Louvre (HdG. 783); Rotterdam, Mus. Boymans-Van Beuningen (Königs collections R. 27); Vienna, Albertina (HdG. 1434). The drawing in Berlin remains a riddle: 'vermutlich Ko- pie nach einer Zeichnung Rembrandts der 50er Jahre, die eine Vorstudie zu Rembrandts Faustradierung gewesen sein könnte' (E. Bock - J.
