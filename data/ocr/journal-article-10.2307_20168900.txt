I).1 This group, indeed, repre sents a large ape, a baboon or perhaps a young chimpanzee, trying to master a strange-looking animal, a gnu, an uncommon species of the ante lope to be found in South and East Africa. Barye's historians have not dealt at length with the "Ape Riding a Gnu." Roger Ballu, in his important study on Barye of 1890, used this group in order to emphasize Barye's inventiveness and fancy.2 Charles Saunier, later, in 1925, was also to comment upon the "Ape Riding a Gnu" similarly in order to stress Barye's fancy, but he added some biographical data most valuable to Barye's historians, and he related a drawing by Barye to this group.3 Charles de Kay alone, in his detailed biography of Barye written in 1889, devoted a long passage to the "Ape Riding a Gnu." De Kay's words are worth being quoted at length. They are noteworthy not only for their sensitive and enthusiastic evaluation of the icono graphical and formal qualities of Barye's compo 1 Inventory no. 27.121. Bronze: signed on base BARYE. H.

The Walters Collection included two casts of the "Ape Riding a Gnu," numbered 2 and 27: Catalogue of the Works of Antoine Louis Barye Exhibited at the American Art Galleries, New York, November 15, 1889-January 15, 1890, p. 19, Nos. 60 and 61. Several casts were exhibited at the Barye Exhi bition in 1889 at the Ecole Nationale des Beaux-Arts, Catalogue des oeuvres de Barye, Paris, No. 116 (Doria Collection), No. 252 (L?on Bonnat Collection). One cast is preserved in the Louvre Museum: J. Guiffrey, La collection Thomy-Thi?ry au Mus?e du Louvre, Cata logue descriptif et historique, Paris, 1903, p. 44. The date 1842 has been accepted by most Barye historians, includ ing G. H. Hamilton, "The Origin of Barye's Tiger Hunt," The Art Bulletin, XVIII (1936), p. 250, note 7. Stanislas Lami, Dictionnaire des sculpteurs de l'?cole fran?aise au XIX i?me si?cle, I (Paris, 1914), p. 76, suggested 1840 1850. The group is titled "Monkey Riding an Antelope" (Singe mont? sur une antilope) in Barye's printed Catalogue des Bronzes of 1855, No. 21. Barye's first Catalogue, published in 1847-1848, named the work "Orang-Outang Riding a Gnu" (Orang-Outang mont? sur un gnou), No. 54. 2 "Would you like now to be amused looking at an entertaining ride? A fanciful Orang-Outang is straddling a gnu. He has mounted the accommodating animal and he is going parading as a handsome cavalier. However, he does not entirely trust his mount and since he is a prudent monkey, and not particularly a brave one, he is holding the tail of the gnu where it begins. This gives an amusing and rakish look to his fancy. Paraphrasing some critics of 1831, I could say: in what country did Mr. Barye see Orang-Outangs riding antelopes? I just want to ask you: Who believed that Mr. Barye had no wit?" L'Oeuvre de Barye, Paris, 1890, p. 89. Ballu's reference to the "critics of 1831" is not meant to suggest a date for the group: it refers to the comments of the critics who were that year particularly antagonistic to romantic sculptors. 3 "He (Barye) used to select his models anywhere, at the Zoo, at traveling animal shows, from certain animal tamers to whom Delacroix, through Barye's recommenda tion, had access; also at the horse-market and at the dog-market. He read extensively?his culture was broad and he had opinions in literature based on a very personal and shrewd criticism?he attended classes at the Museum, he took notes on the customs of the animals, on their physiological peculiarities. . . . The Petit-Palais owns one of his most remarkable (drawings), the trans fer in ink of the composition representing on orang outang riding on a gnu. The drawing possesses the same fantasies as the bronze . . . ," Barye, Paris, 1925. 67</page><page sequence="3">THE JOURNAL OF THE WALTERS ART GALLERY sition, but also for the clearly stated references to Barye's beliefs.4 On the basis of the "Ape Riding a Gnu" only and in the absence of any information concerning the nature of Barye's zoological philosophy, one does not feel entirely safe in blindly following de Kay in his conclusions. Although Barye must have been perfectly aware of the contemporary discussions that divided zoologists Cuvier and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, especially over the ques tion of the fixity or the mutation of animal species,5 Barye's sympathy towards the two points referred to by de Kay: first, a "progressionist" attitude in regard to the problem of the evolution of zoological species and, secondly, a belief in the "intelligence" of the primates, does not seem as evident as is suggested by de Kay's terms? which clearly reflect a Darwinian attitude. Rather than being used as the conclusive argu ment in discussing whether or not the "Ape Riding a Gnu" fundamentally illustrates "the reign of brain which has opened a chasm between human beings and beasts," Barye's group may serve to cast some light on his still obscure artistic methods and, specifically, give evidence of his concern for and debt to the zoological literature of his time? an attitude to be expected from an artist always involved in securing the most accurate knowledge of the animals he represented. In the case of the "Ape Riding a Gnu," Barye's direct source, both iconographical and formal, appears to have been an engraved vignette made by a specialist in zoological illustrations, Thomas Landseer, for a publication by a noted traveller, John Henry Barrow, Characteristic Sketches of Animals, Principally in the Zoological Gardens, Regent's Park, published in London in 1832 (fig. 2).6 This vignette is explicitly described in Barrow's publication as "gnus getting rid of baboons which have mounted their backs."7 More 4 "Barye was permeated with the scientific spirit of the age but his ideas were necessarily lacking in the clear ness they might have gained later in the century, and the forms in which to express them were necessarily limited to those already known and at least partially accepted as beautiful by men of cultivation. He could not very well model an imaginary Missing Link, that figment of a popular misconception regarding theories of evolution. He could not even, by using his knowl edge of living animals and the record of extinct forms left in the rocks, create afresh the probable appearance of former denizens of the earth whether human or not; because to do so would not be art but palaeontology. But what he did do on the less artistic side was to advance a step from the combats of wild creatures to the first faint appearance of the subjection of one beast by another for its own profit. He seems to have been think ing of man at an epoch so remote that while he was by no means a monkey, some of the traits now found in the apes had not been eliminated from his nature. He fashioned perhaps his boldest and certainly one of his least beautiful groups, the Ape Riding a Gnu. "The gnu is an African creature which recalls on the one hand the combination of animals found in the art of peoples of Asia Minor and through them the Greeks, such as the Centaur, Chimera, Pegasus, Bucephalus; and on the other the latest doctrines of evolution; because it seems to retain the type of a creature existing in an age when the present types had not been sundered. Its head is that of an antelope, its horns and feet those of cattle, its mane, body and tail those of a horse. With some likelihood the gnu may be considered the origin of the fabled unicorn, which may have been known in Europe only through profile drawings that showed but one of its two horns, and that one apparently jutting from the brow of a slender horse. "Barye has seized on this extraordinary figure, partly because its fine legs and flowing tail make it a graceful object, whatever may be thought of its head; and on its back he placed an ape in the act of essaying to ride. It is a large ape of the chimpanzee variety, which of all the four-handed race is closest to human beings in intelligence. The look of earnest meditation on the ape's face as he attempts this wonderful feat relieves the statuette of any suspicion of the comic. Admirable in its ape-like gravity and signs of thought, the positions of hands and feet are no less characteristic. The long arms reach with ease the tail of the gnu behind and a big lock of the mane in front, thus preventing an upset from the bucking and rearing of the surprised steed. At the same time the other pair of hands, which in us are feet, grip the barrel of the gnu firmly and prevent the ape from slipping to either side. "We have here an object less beautiful, less terrible than the lion smiting a python or the elephant transfixing a tiger with his tusk. It is no longer strength against strength and the weaker to the wall! Here is the reign of brain which has opened that chasm between human beings and beasts, which the ancients after the birth of Christ widened beyond all reason, and which the moderns, Barye among them, have sought to properly estimate and bridge. This neglected statuette that few own and still fewer care for, is in some respects quite the most remarkable work that ever emanated from the workshop of Barye's mind."

The gnu in the early nineteenth century was still a perplexing wild animal which had only re cently been "catalogued" by zoologists after it had puzzled travellers in South Africa for a long time. Scientific and popular accounts had agreed in stressing the bizarreness of its parts. In 1801 John Barrow had well summarized the first views on the animal: "Nature, though regular and sys tematic in all her works, often puzzles and per plexes human systems, of which this animal is an instance. In the shape of its body, it evidently partakes of the horse, the ox, the stag and the antelope. . . ."10 Among the zoologists, Georges Cuvier, the most prominent such figure on the European scene in 1817, was still referring to the gnu as "a most extraordinary animal, which even seems, at first sight, a monster composed of parts of several animals . . ."n The bizarre appearance and wild behavior of the gnu found an echo in popular literature, which still quoted the descrip tion by Aelian and that by Pliny of the "Catoble pas"?the animal whose look could kill?a feature which had been recalled by Cuvier himself in his description of the gnu.12 10 John Barrow, Travels into the Interior of South Africa . . .

Three living gnus could be seen in London in 1830 and had probably served as models for Landseer.13 In Paris, one gnu was apparently living at the M?nagerie in 1801, although it is not in cluded in Lac?p?de's Description ... of 1804.14 Accounts on the M?nagerie published around the mid-century, however, do not indicate clearly whether the gnus they mention were kept as living animals or as museum specimens.15 Indeed, it does not seem that Barye had been particularly inter ested?or perhaps able?to study the challenging anatomy of the gnu as an example of contempo rary ideas on "transformism." Nothing relates to the gnu in the numerous anatomical drawings by Barye, and among the animals Barye represented in his painted or sculptured figures or groups it appears only three times.16 In contrast to his usual painstaking method of measuring each part of the body in order to master the anatomy of the animal, Barye seems in this case to have relied confidently upon Landseer's illustration.17 In fact, this illus tration exemplified popular and technical accounts according to which, towards the mid-century, the gnu was progressively demythicized and related to the horse rather than to any other animal previ ously cited in connection with it?stag, buffalo or antelope.18 Barye's most noteworthy alteration of Landseer's illustration lay in characterizing the gnu in an attitude typical of a prancing horse, its body arched and its leg raised; the ape itself has been given a more emphatic posture. Whereas Landseer's illustration had shown an extended animal, stumbling over a rock or a tree before entering the river, Barye's group, as pertinently stressed by de Kay, isolated the association of both animals in a controlled and ennobled composition which is typically that of an equestrian group. After all, if presented with Landseer's illustra tion alone, the viewer might as well ask the very question de Kay posed in regard to Barye's "Ape Riding a Gnu." Indeed, so far as the meaning is concerned, the only point of the association of the ape with the gnu is provided by the caption cited above which accompanies Landseer's vig 13 List of the Vertebrated Animals Exhibited in the Gardens of the Zoological Society of London, 1828-1927, London, 1929, p. 277. 14 "In 1801, a new hut was constructed for the gnu . . . ," P.A.

H. Hamilton, op. cit., p. 249, note 2.

The same Catalogue lists a Gnu as a "new model," not numbered. G. Laviron, Le Salon de 1834, Paris, 1834, pp. 360-361, mentioned that Barye exhibited a water color representing "un serpent ?touffant une antilope au bord d'un ?tang" (Serpent crushing an antelope at a pond), a work which has not been located, C. O. Zieseniss, Les Aquarelles de Barye, Paris, s.d., p. 21. 17 No inventory of Barye's library has been published. Although no copy of the Characteristic Sketches . . . , is preserved at the Biblioth?que Nationale nor at the Li brary of the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle, drawings by members of the Landseer family were known to French artists and critics. Reviewing Barye's participation in the Exposition de la Soci?t? des Amis des Arts held at the Louvre in 1831, a critic writing in l'Artiste, noted that two water-colors sent by Barye "could make Landseer envious:" cit. by Zieseniss, op. cit., p. 20 (L'Artiste, II, p. 177). G. H. Hamilton identified a sketch for the "Ape Riding a Gnu" in a sketchbook of Barye's kept at the Maryland Institute, Baltimore, which dates in the early 1830's; the page shows two sketches: one, an ape mounted on a horse and the other the neck and withers of a prancing horse with a suggestion of two horns which could relate it to a gnu, op. cit., p. 250, note 7 (fig. 4). 18 ". . . the form of the neck, tail and legs with the exception of the feet is exactly that of a small compact fleet and strong horse . . . ," The British Cyclopaedia of Natural History, ed. by C.

However, neither in Barrow's Travels into the Interior of South Africa, nor in his text for the Characteristic Sketches do we find any allusion to the reported association between the two animals; nor is there any allusion to it in the common tech nical or popular literature on both animals. It may be stressed that the character of Land seer's illustration is that of an anecdote, a "genre scene," and if one considers the date of its publi cation, 1832 at the latest, one is not inclined to explain it in the light of ideas reflecting a "seien tifie" attitude. Landseer's subject can only refer to allusions constantly repeated in art and literature concerning the anthropomorphic behavior and mimetic virtues of the apes?allusions very differ ent from the speculations and experiments on the "intelligence" of the primates which were carried on not prior to the second half of the nineteenth century.19 Since modern zoologists are not inclined to accept the represented association of the ape with the gnu as a natural means of locomotion of the adult baboon,20 Landseer's illustration reflects a 19 Milne Edwards, op. cit., passim; R.

One cannot deny, however, Barye's intense interest in this association and his success in transforming Landseer's illustration into a highly challenging zoological drama. Thus, al though the exact nature of Barye's intentions re mains unexplained, they are in any case closer to early nineteenth-century thinking and especially to Lamarck's ideas on organic changes and Lamarck's consequent hypothesis on the "supremacy" of quadrumanous races21 than they are to de Kay's conclusions, penetrated as they are with extrapo lated Darwinism. 21 "Let us now suppose that a quadrumanous race, say the most perfect, acquired through constant habit among its individuals the conformation just described, and the faculty of standing and walking upright, and that ultimately it gained the supremacy over the other races of animals, we can easily conceive . . . that this pre dominant race, having acquired an absolute supremacy over all the rest, will ultimately establish a difference between itself and the most perfect animals, and indeed will leave them far behind . . . The most perfect of the quadrumanous races might thus have become dominant; have changed its habits as a result of the absolute sway exercised over the others, and of its new wants; have progressively acquired modifications in its organization, and many new faculties; have kept back the most perfect of the other races to the condition that they had reached; and have wrought very striking distinctions be tween these last and themselves," "Some Observations in Regard to Man," in J.
