<plain_text><page sequence="1">Destiny and Retribution in Late Imperial China by Paolo Santangelo The office jack's career is blighted, The rich man's fortune now all vanished, The kind with life have been required, The cruel exemplarily punished; The one who owed a life is dead, The tears one owed have all been shed. Wrongs suffered have the wrongs done expiated; The couplings and the sunderings were fated. Untimely death sin in some past life shows, But only luck a blest old age bestows [...] (*) 1. Some Neo-Confucian Conceptions of Destiny Luck and mischance have no door, Man calls them by himself. (2) The concept of destiny is one of the major themes discussed in both literary and philosophical texts and one deserving study in its own right. While systematic and general investigation of this concept in China would lie beyond the scope of the present work, neither can it be ignored in that it has been discussed in ethical and utilitarian terms since ancient times and represents an important element in passing moral judgement. It is, in fact, no coincidence that frequent references to retribution are to be found in the section on social relations and human affairs of the monumental 18th century encyclopaedia 'Collection of Illustrations and Writings Both Ancient (*) The present paper is the result of work carried out in the framework of the research on ethical concepts in Ming-Qing China directed by myself (on the grant of the C.N.R.) and of the research on Chinese aesthetic and moral thought directed by Prof. Lionello Lanciotti (on the grant of the Ministry for the University and Scientific and Technological Research, 40%).

The section deals, inter alia, with questions regarding destiny and the shifting of fortune, such as longevity or brevity of life, good or bad luck, wealth and poverty, differences in social position, life and death (3). The concept of destiny is normally expressed by the term tianming, which is closely linked to the idea of heaven, tian (4). In this context, the character ming which by itself means 'order' or 'command' but also 'life', comes to mean both the quality with which each being is endowed from birth and the predestined duration and conditions of their existence (6). However, as we shall see below, the concept of destiny can also be expressed by other terms. In general, the writings of Chinese thinkers have shown particular interest in the possible relation between suffering and happiness on the one hand, and human responsibility on the other. Exemplary in this sense are the concept of destiny ([tian]ming) at the individual level and that of the Way (Dao), order and disorder, at the collective. What cannot be easily explained is commonly attributed to destiny: 'what is done without anyone being its author comes from heaven; what takes place without anyone having acted is destiny' (7). While it is clear that the events referred to here are such as lie beyond human comprehension and control, the passage remains obscure as to the meaning and the role attributed to 'destiny', 'fate' or 'chance': a despotic and domineering divinity, a consistent and just providence, or a personification of what might be termed 'imponderable' (8)? On the one hand, it turns out that the action attributed to destiny is not merely confined to moral retribution and the rewarding or punishing of man's merits and faults. It also includes, for example, the factor of time ? the long or short duration of life and of political activity ? which lies beyond the scope of any ethical category. On the other, it is clear that man must accept this destiny ? either as a personification or simply as the course of events ? (3) Cf. GJTSJC, Minglun huibian, Renshi dian, juan 63-92. (4) Cf. Jiang Guozhu, Zhongguo renshilun shi, Zhengzhou 1989, pp. 20-82, 525-30. See also P. Santangelo, The Origin of Good and Evil in Human Nature According to Neo-Confucianism. Some Aspects of the Question', EW&gt; 40, 1990, pp. 231-59. (5) The character ming is found in the earliest philosophical treatises, including the Confucian Classics and the compilations of other schools of thought. It may be translated in various ways as 'order', 'destiny', 'life', 'nature', 'way' or 'mandate of heaven'. (6) See for example the use made in the chapter Shouming of the Baihu tong, 8: 4b-5ab, in a sense encompassing the meaning of life and destiny at the same time: 'What is the meaning of the term "destiny" (ming)? It is the duration of life, what the heavens have allotted to man. There are three types of life destiny [...]'. (7) Cf. Mencius, 5a, 6. (8) Destiny should be .distinguished from fate (which is traced back to an absolute and more or less aware cause) in that the former does not rule out the possibility of human intervention, and from chance and fortune since these, while lying beyond human freedom, at the same time rule out the presence of a law or of a purpose. For the concept of pure chance as absolute but blind freedom at the basis of the process of natural evolution, see J. Monod, II caso e la necessitd. Saggi sulla filosofia naturale della biologia contemporanea, Milano 1979. 378 [2]</page><page sequence="3">and seek to understand it and adapt to it; otherwise he is bound to encounter a series of misfortunes and defeats. Hitherto we have considered what can be deduced with certainty from the cited passage by Mencius, whose views on this point we shall be returning to below. There are, however, various conceptions of destiny, starting from the retributive view dealt with in some of the following sections. According to Chinese scholars, there are two main tendencies: the unitary view (tianren heyi), which envisages continuous interaction and reciprocity between the heavens and man; and the opposite view {tianren zhifen), which sees no relation between nature and humanity, between destiny and man's behaviour (9). In actual fact, the situation is far more complex since the Chinese terms ming ('mandate', 'destiny') and tian ('heaven') often retain strong moral overtones, similar to those of the Christian term 'providence', while the ideas of fortune, fate and destiny do not necessarily have any ethical implications in the West (10). In China too there are different terms that may be identified with the idea of destiny and different ways of interpreting this concept. Thus the idea is also present of 'chance' or 'luck', i.e. of what comes about by mere coincidence, a contingent event resulting from no underlying will or decision. An example is found in a passage by Ling Mengchu, in which the concept of destiny, understood as a mysterious and irresistible force, is contrasted with that of chance in the words of two sea spirits: 'Tonight's meeting was due to destiny and not to chance' (n) . Here we are faced with two opposing concepts: destiny understood as a force with its own logic and its own plan indicated (9) Cf. Jiang Guozhu, op. cit., p. 20. (10) Not always however. If we consider the case of Mozi, the author of a treatise against fatalism and advocate of religious-retributive views, we find that he identifies the term ming with 'fate' in the amoral, irrational and deterministic sense. According to Mozi, the advocates of the existence of ming claimed that if one's destiny was wealth then wealth it was, if poverty then poverty, and that the same principle held for longevity, for rewards and punishment, and at the level of the state for population, peace and order. (Cf. Mozi, [Sibu beiyao] 9: la-b, 3a-b). He denounced this as a justification whereby the wicked would rid themselves of all responsibility and opposed to it the morality of the concept of human responsibility, which postulates man's influence on his fortunes through the existence of a causal nexus between individual action (diligence, parsimony and rectitude) and divine retribution (cf. ibid., 9: 3a-b, 4b, 5b, 7a). For the Taoists, destiny (ming) was originally a metaphor indicating the spontaneity of reality. Therefore, though life and death at the right moment were regarded in the Liezi as the gift of heaven, they were not regarded as depending either upon ourselves or upon others but upon 'destiny' understood as the spontaneous movement of the celestial Dao: 'They are neither a gift from heaven nor an evil arising from [the misdeeds of] men' (Liezi, Liming, [Ershierzi, Shanghai 1986] 6: 214). Destiny is here a synonym of times (shi) or circumstances (shi). (Cf. Liezi, 6: 215). For comparison with the traditional European view of Fortune, Nature and Providence, see A. Plaks, Archetype and Allegory in the Dream of the Red Chamber, Princeton 1977, pp. 111-26. (n) 'Shu fei ourany, in Erke pai'an jingqi, Hong Kong 1985, 37: 764. This concept may recall the ming of Xunzi and Wang Chong, the accidental meeting of circumstances. Concerning the complex Xunzi's concept of Heaven, see the recent essay by R. Eno, The Confucian Creation of Heaven. Philosophy and the Defense of Ritual Mastery, New York 1990, pp. 154-69. [3] 379</page><page sequence="4">by shu ? number ? and blind, irrational fortuitous chance, ouran. However, in the more strictly philosophical field there is another concept that may be likened to that of destiny. This is the term ziran, which is translated as 'nature' or 'natural' in modern Chinese but was used by Neo-Confucian thinkers to indicate the 'spontaneity' of the perpetual evolution of the universe, and hence also included events concerning mankind (12). The Chinese concept of 'natural spontaneity' ? like fate ? transcends human reason and purposes and is perceived as a inner necessity or an imposition from outside (biran), so much so that in some cases it may be compared to the Greek concept of andnke. However, it is not regarded as immutable by all thinkers. As the divinities were seen as participating in its making in the late Greek and the Egyptian religions, so some Neo-Confucian thinkers regard the sage as able to intervene in and contribute to the process (13). Moreover, as conceived in Taoist thought, destiny is at the same time chaos, necessity and freedom: given the unity of all beings in the dao, the sage achieves a complete identification of destiny and freedom in the 'spontaneity of nature' (14). (12) It is clearly a Taoist legacy. See the meanings attributed to the term by Guo Xiang (?-312 A.D.) in his comments on the text of the Zhuangzi (Zhuangzi jishi, Taibei 1970, in particular b: 121-54) ? of which Tang Yijie, 'Questions Concerning the Categorical System of Traditional Chinese Philosophy', Social Sciences in China, 1982, 4, p. 195, identifies five interconnected variants: perfect knowledge, spontaneous behaviour, conformity with one's own nature, inevitability and causality ? such as causality and inevitability, spontaneous change (or 'independent transformation', duhua) and behaviour conforming to one's own nature, all of which being linked to the concept of destiny (6: 121, 122b, 130a-b, 151b, 154a; 8: 174b). Cf. also the entry ziran by Chan Wing-tsit in Wei Zhengtong, ed., Zhongguo zhexue cidian daquan, Taibei 1983, pp. 253-54, where it is denied that the concept of 'spontaneity' in Confucianism stems from Taoism. However, this concept also existed in ancient Confucianism both as physical nature (Lunyu, 17, 19) and as naturalness in human behaviour (cf. Lunyu, 15, 4; Mencius, 2a, 2). In Neo Confucianism, the concept of spontaneity as spontaneous morality was introduced by the Cheng brothers through interpretation of the passage in Mencius which advises the avoidance of both negligence and haste in cultivating oneself (2a, 2). Particular attention was paid to this subject by Chen Xianzhang (1428-1500). For a new attempt at interpreting the term ziran, see Callaham, 'Discourse and Perspective in Daoism: A Linguistic Interpretation of ziran', Philosophy East and West, 39, 2, 1989. (13) Cf. for example L? Kun, Shenyin yu, 4, cit. in Jiang Guozhu, op. cit., p. 77. Cf. also the 'natural principle of spontaneity' (ziran zhi li) in Xiong Bolong (1617-1669) or in Sanguo yanyi (Beijing 1953, 93: 751), and 'to use the invisible power of the universe' (yong tiandi zhi shen) or 'to create destiny' (zaotian) in Wang Fuzhi (1619-1692). According to the Sanguo yanyi, the 'natural principle of spontaneity' corresponded to changes in destiny (tianshu you bian) followed by dynastic changes and the advent of a sovereign worthy of his tasks, the latter thus being in keeping with the heavenly will and with human wishes (tianxin renyi). (14) Cf. Guo Xiang's comment on the first book of Zhuangzi with regard to the concept of ziran (e.g. Zhuangzi jishi, 1: 12-13). It could be said that originally the Taoist idea of destiny was diametrically opposed to that of Mozi. In fact, the latter's retributive morality goes far beyond the Confucian concept of moral responsibility, according to which the ethical nature of an act does not coincide with its practical effects (fortune, success, wealth, longevity). Thus, with the same scepticism as Wang Chong, the author of the chapter on destiny in Liezi regards man's striving as having no effect whatsoever on his lot in that it is neither classifiable nor capable of influence. However, this 'fatalism' is anything but passive 380 [4]</page><page sequence="5">While Wang Anshi (1021-1086) saw heaven as corresponding to physical nature in their incessant transformation and creation, devoid of understanding, will or aim, Shao Yong (1011-1077), Zhou Dunyi (1017-1073), Zhang Zai (1020-1077) and above all Sima Guang (1019-1086) saw a close reciprocal influence between heaven and man, with the former determining the latter's health, prosperity and prestige. Zhang Zai, who had already clearly distinguished the moral sphere from the physical in his well known statement that 'energy cannot be changed only in the sphere of death, birth, longevity and brevity of life' (15), saw 'sincerity' or 'integrity' as the virtue upon which man's harmony with the heavens depended. In his development of Shao Yong's views of life, destiny and human nature (16), Chen Yi formulated the following definition (17): 'Destiny is what is instilled by heaven and [human] nature is what beings have received' (18). Hence the twofold meaning of destiny: of moral nature, which depends on individual effort and self cultivation, and of life-death, fortune-misfortune, which lie beyond direct human control. The great innovation of the Cheng brothers in completing the work of the cosmologists was their elevation of 'principle' to the rank of heaven in such a way that the latter, the Mandate, destiny and the Way all became different aspects of the one principle. This covered both the natural and the moral field, the reigns of necessity and of freedom, and in this way the various possibilities and the alternative choices all corresponded to principles that were descriptive and normative at the same and inert. The 'spontaneity' and 'automatism' it advocates are distinguished from licence, which would come under the 'forging' and 'alienation' of true inner freedom. Just as wuwei does not mean 'not to act' in the literal sense, while this concept of destiny denies traditional moral values and criteria and logical distinctions, discipline is not ignored but actually presupposed. This discipline makes it possible to arrive at a series of acts that do not entail a conscious choice among various alternatives, an internal effort, a struggle within one's conscience, existential indecision. The perception of chaos stems from the knowledge that nothing is solid or stable. Reality is necessity (budeyi) in that every phenomenon is determined by natural order (tianli) or by destiny (ming). But it becomes freedom to the extent to which the sage accepts this reality and even identifies with it. The 'true man' is he who regognizes the futility of rebellion and achieves complete inner freedom. At this point, what may appear as unnatural constraint or external imposition becomes free adherence to and participation in the eternal cosmic transformation. (Cf. for example the work by Izutsu Toshihiko, Sufism and Taoism: A Comparative Study of Key Philosophical Concepts, Berkeley and Los Angeles 1984, pp. 419-29). Cf. Van Houten, 'Nature and Tzu-jan in Early Chinese Philosophical Literature', Journal of Chinese Philosophy, 15, 1988. (15) Cf. Zhang Hengqu xiansheng wenji, (Congshu jicheng) 3: 40. Compare the views of Zhu Xi, who states that as wealth and prestige are things external to the person one can never be certain of obtaining them, whereas the opposite is true of moral principles (Zhuzi yulei, Beijing 1983, 13: 225). (16) Cf. Huangji jingshi, Guantou waipian (Sibu beiyao). (17) For similarities and differences between Neo-Confucianism and Taoism in the use of certain philosophical terms, including ming, see I. Robinet, 'La notion de hsing dans le taoi'sme et son rapport avec celle du confucianisme', JAOS, 106, 1, 1986, pp. 183-96. (18) Cf. Jinsilu jijie, Taibei 1982, 1:6.

In their reinterpretation of the Yijing, the Neo-Confucian thinkers relate the concept of destiny to those of principle and of nature. As we read in Yan Cai's comment on the Jinsilu: Spirit [invisible forces], shen, is the mystery of all things and has no spacial restrinction. Transformation is the manifestation of all things and can be traced. To understand spirit to the utmost and to know process of transformation is to investigate the principles of things to the utmost, to develop one's nature fully, and to establish one's destiny. (20) The first section of the first chapter of the Neo-Confucian glossary Xingli ziyi offers a clear explanation of the different meanings of the word ming: one in terms of principle, as endowment of human nature or human destiny, and one in terms of energy. In the latter case, the word is used to indicate the duration of each person's life, their social and financial condition, prestige and wealth, health and longevity, and thus their happy or unhappy destiny. However, it also includes the meaning of human character, as in the case of different endowments of virtues and qualities (in accordance with the purity or impurity of the energy constituting the individual). In this way, it was held, for example, that the disciple of Confucius Yan Hui had been endowed not only with human nature (i.e. principle) and energy of great clarity (in the moral sense), but also with and energy whereby he was predestined to a short life (in the true sense of destiny) (21). Destiny could thus be interpreted in the 'static' or in the 'dynamic' sense. In the first case, what it represented for both the individual and the social group was fact, that which took place of necessity and was passively inherited, or which took place independently of human will and capacity (22), or at least independently of the (19) Cf. A.C. Graham, Two Chinese Philosophers. Ch'eng Ming-tao and Ch'eng Yich'uan, London 1958, pp. 23-30. (20) Cf. Chan Wing-tsit's translation, with small changes, in Reflections on Things at Hand..., op. cit., p. 72. (21) Cf.

The Chinese Classical with a translation, critical and exegetical notes, prolegomena, and copious indexes, Oxford 1893 (repr. Taibei 1985) p. 359. The concept of destiny is generally accepted by Confucian thinkers. For example, Xun Yue (148-209) wrote as follows: That with which one is [endowed] from birth is called human nature [...]. That which [causes] the development and the end of life is called destiny, that is good and had fortune [...]. The superior man is in agreement with his nature in such a way as to complete destiny'. (Cf. Ch'en Ch'i-y?n, Hs?n Y?eh and the Mind of Late Han China. A Translation of the Shen-chien with Introduction and Annotations, Princeton 1980, p. 186). The debates on destiny also recall other Taoist themes. See for example the chapter 'effort and destiny' (Liming) in the collection attributed to Liezi (Liezi, 6, in Ershier zi, p. 213; cf. A.C. Graham, The Book of Lieh Tzu, London 1960): the conditions of life are attributed to destiny, which is not however the controller and governor of the universe. In the dialogue between 382 [6]</page><page sequence="7">measures and precautions that one could reasonably adopt (23). In this perspective, a person's behaviour, which concerns his moral sphere directly, can itself become an event that in turn influences the destinies of other individuals. This is what is termed contingent or accidental in the life of an individual or in history. In literary and religious sources, however, destiny is often viewed as the projection of previous actions and behaviour, the consequence of certain conduct. And here we have the other aspect, the dynamic, i.e. the aspect regarding the characteristics that man is able to mould and modify, the conditions that can be indirectly influenced by his behaviour. In this second meaning, destiny falls within the individual's moral sphere (24). In this sense, Mencius' doctrine of liming or 'establishing destiny' constitutes the evolution of the Confucian theory of 'understanding destiny'. In fact, Tang Junyi [T'ang Ch?n-i] has demonstrated the importance of morality in the sphere of the ancient Confucian view and, more generally speaking, of the classical Chinese views (25). In his Summa of Neo-Confucianism, Zhu Xi summarized all the characteristics of destiny ? the spontaneity with which it acts, the chance nature but also the necessity of its results (26) ? and then went on to distinguish between two fundamental meanings of the term ming: the first regarding the conditions of life (status, health, prestige, wealth, power, birth and death, longevity and brevity of life), which belong to 'energy' and do not involve morals; and the second regarding principle and ethics (purity, righteousness and wisdom) (27). However, it was one thing to distinguish moral qualities from the physical and material qualities the individual might be endowed with ? in order to discern the import of a man's destiny and the role of his action ? and another to establish the moral or amoral character of destiny. Opinions destiny and effort, the former states that he is not in a position to determine the duration of life, success and failure, wealth and poverty, and that these come about by themselves. Some Taoist circles thus underlined the pointless alienation from oneself occasioned by the pursuit of external illusions such as wealth and fame and advocated rather the Epicurean ideal of the enjoyment of pleasures easy to achieve. For comparison with Wang Chong, cf. the following sections. (23) Cf. Mencius, 7a, 2. (24) Cf. Mencius 5a, 5: The heavens do not speak. They have simply shown their will through the conduct and policies of Shun'. (25) Unlike the Old Testament or Greek ideas, the celestial destiny-mandate is neither predetermined nor arbitrary but impartially linked to man's virtue. This view is thought to emerge in the Classic of the Odes, in the Classic of the Documents and in the Zuozhuan, as well as in the Analects. And it is precisely in the name of the morality of destiny that Mozi had criticized Confucius to assert the existence of heavenly goodness and its power to reward or punish men for their conduct. Cf. T'ang Ch?n-i, The T'ien Ming [Heavenly Ordinance] in Pre-Ch'in China', Philosophy East and West, 11, 4, 1962, pp. 195-218; 12, 1, 1962, pp. 29-49. (26) Cf. Zhuzi yulei, 4: 79-90. (27) Cf. Zhuzi yulei, 4: 77-80. The former is also called the 'destiny of life and of death', and the second 'celestial destiny or nature'. In any case, everything depends on the qualities of the energy: wisdom (on its clarity), prestige (on its height), well-being (on its richness) and longevity (on its length). Cf. 4: 79. [7] 383</page><page sequence="8">on this point were divided and often contradictory. Zhu Xi himself was ambiguous, for example, on the meaning of the term tian, heaven or sky, not distinguishing clearly between the spheres of morals, nature and necessity. He referred as a rule to a non anthropomorphic conception of heaven as a metaphysical entity transcending individual peculiarities, while at the same time using the term to refer to the physical sky. His references to both its understanding and its ordering capacity were abstract (28). In fact, when Zhu Xi discussed tianxin ? 'mind of heaven' or 'will of heaven' ? he did so in metaphorical terms in order to underline the morally good structure of nature and destiny (29). He wrote: Now they say that there is someone in the sky who judges crimes and faults; this is false. Equally erroneous is it to assert that the moral Way is totally devoid of an ordering being. (30) Zhu Xi thus denied heaven the properties of understanding and intention, attributing it rather with an impersonal order like the Dao (the Way), and asserted that the alternation of the four seasons, the birth and death of all beings, and the various phenomena all came about with no celestial intervention (31). For that matter, the terms for 'impart', 'confer' and 'endow' ? ming, jiang, bing ? were all used in a figurative sense in Neo-Confucian texts to indicate the being's assumption of a form, character of power (32), and discussions about heaven formed an integral part of a broader debate on destiny and retribution. These quotations make it possible to deduce the existence of a vast range of opinions about destiny within the sphere of Neo-Confucianism. These opinions reflected the various views then existing in China: from those which identified it with the quasi-personal will of heaven to those regarding it as completely severed from morality and man's behaviour. (28) Cf. H. Cleveland Tillman, 'Consciousness of T'ien in Chu Hsi's Thought', HJAS, 1987, 1, pp. 31-50. (29) Cf. ibid., pp. 46-47. (30) Cf. Zhuzi yulei, 1: 5. (31) Cf. Zhuzi yuleiy 1: 4-5. In any case, according to a comment by Mao Zonggang on the Sanguo yanyi, the action of heaven corresponds to that of man (cf. A. Plaks, The Four Masterworks of the Ming Novel. Ssu ta ch'i-shu, Princeton 1987, p. 491). (32) According to a famous Neo-Confucian glossary (Beixi ziyi), the term ming is explained as follows: 'Ming is like an order, an order given by a superior or an official order. Heaven neither speaks nor acts. How could it give orders? The fact is that when the great transformation comes into operation and prevails, each time that energy reaches the point of becoming something, that thing is born, and when it reaches the point of becoming something else, that something else is born. In this sense one can speak of order'. Chan Wing-tsit, Neo-Confucian Terms Explained..., op. cit., p. 37. 384 [8]</page><page sequence="9">2. The Retributive Tradition Now the king of Shang venerates not heaven and inflicts suffering on the people [...] so that Heaven's Sovereign is shaken with range [...] Heaven protects the humble. (33) Life and death are predestined; fortune and honour depend on heaven. (34) As mentioned above, a consistent considerable part of Chinese tradition sees man as capable of somehow influencing destiny, albeit indirectly, if in no other way than by foreseeing the natural or celestial consequences of his conduct. This conception encompasses physical good and evil, happiness and prosperity, death and suffering. The widespread retributive conception made it possible to correlate the concept of moral good and evil with the sphere of individual and social happiness. In fact, 'destiny' may be used to translate other Chinese terms, such as yuan (cause, predestination, vocation), yinguo (cause and effect, in the same life or in relation to a previous existence), bao and baoying (retribution for previous behaviour). All of these are closely bound up with the concepts of morality and of the practical consequences (reward and punishment) arising from human conduct. For Taoists, the notion of the 'transmission of merits and demerits' (chengfu) is equally connected with the concept of retribution, as is the idea of 'karmic destiny' (sutning) derived from Buddhism (35). The concept of destiny is relevant for the present work precisely by virtue of its ethical implications. As we have seen, in its static aspect the term indicates that which lies beyond the individual's will or action and should thus be extraneous to his moral sphere. And yet it has also been observed that in its dynamic sense it can be modified by human intervention, at least in certain sectors. How far can destiny thus be regarded as 'moral' or 'amoral'? Is there any relationship between human behaviour and destiny, good or bad luck? If so, of what nature? In China, the starting point of all retributive views is the theory of the existence of a close relationship between heavenly and human actions. The retributive attitude consisted in expecting propitious or unpropitious events in relation to previous conduct, in expecting punishment or reward in the present life and after death (i.e. in the underworld and/or in successive reincarnations) (36). It was present in every aspect (33) Shujing, 5, 1, 4-7. (34) L??y?, 12, 5, 3. (35) Cf. I. Robinet, 'Notes preliminaires sur quelques antinomies fondamentales entre le bouddhisme et le taoisme', in L. Lanciotti, ed., Incontri di religioni in Asia tra il III e UX secolo d.C, Firenze 1984, pp. 227-29. (36) Even such an anti-Buddhist rationalist as Han Yu (768-824) put forward a retributive theory according to which heaven was the arbiter of fortune and mischance, of man's good and bad conditions, rewarding his merits and punishing his faults. [9] 385</page><page sequence="10">of Chinese society and its manifestations were even evident in public life, where they influenced legislation (37) and the examination system (38). Long before Buddhism introduced the idea of karma, which provided a way of justifying misfortune in terms of human conduct (39) even over a number of generations, the principle of the collective responsibility of the family, clan or neighbourhood was already known in China, and not solely in the penal and institutional field. While denying the personification of heaven and destiny found in Taoism and popular Buddhism, Gu Yanwu traces the distant origins of the Confucian retributive tradition back to the 'Classic of Changes' and the 'Classic of Documents' (40). The concepts of the Heavenly Mandate and of interaction between human actions and cosmic influences (41) had moreover been reworked by Mencius at the social and political level within another ancient tradition dating from the beginning of the Zhou period. These concepts introduced a strong moral character into the idea of destiny and contributed to the affirmation of retributive views in both daily and political life as well as in historiography. Confucius himself had been ambiguous on this point in that, while he had often understood heaven as an impersonal physical entity or as the natural law governing the birth and motion of the beings in the universe (42), on other occasions he had assigned to it both will and a capacity for control over human events, identifying it with destiny understood in an almost religious sense (43). This attitude, which was already present in the Confucian classics (44), especially the 'Classic of (37) The concept of retribution is obviously found in the penal field.

Meijer, 'An Aspect of retribution in Traditional Chinese Law', TP, 66, 4-5, 1980, pp. 199-216. On relations between responsibility and penal retribution see J. Gernet, 'A propos de la notion de responsabilite dans l'ancien droit chinois', in L. Lanciotti, ed., lldiritto in Cina. Teoria e applicazioni durante le dinastie imperiali e problematica diel diritto cinese contemporaneo, Firenze 1978, pp. 127-36. (38) The attitude was so widespread as to manifest itself even in the official ceremonies of the state examinations. Before the examination itself, the spirits were invoked with the request to 'repay favours with favours', you'en bao'en. In the words of E. Zi (Shanghai 1894, p. 142): 'The pagans believe that if a literary man leads an immoral life, if he has shameful habits, or if he pursues wealth unjustly, he will not be able to avoid heaven's punishment in these examinations [...]'. Belief in retribution was thus encouraged not only in order to reinvigorate official morals but also to justify the working of the examination system. (39) It should however be remembered that, strictly speaking, Buddhism regards suffering as arising not from sin or violation of moral order but from 'primordial nescience' (avidya). (40) For the Yijing, see the well known citation drawn from the hexagram kun and for the Shujing, 2, 2, 1; 4, 3, 3; 4, 4, 4; 4, 6, 3, in Rizbilu jishi, Hui di ji cong ni xiong, Taibei 1974, 2: 24. (41) Cf. for example Mencius, 2a, 2; 4a, 12; 7a, 1, 13 on the identity of human nature with celestial. (42) Cf. for example Lunyu, 17, 19. (43) Cf. Lunyu, 3, 13; 6, 26; 7, 22; 8, 19; 9, 5, 11. (44) There are numerous examples in the Confucian classics of the idea of a natural justice to punish or reward men for their behaviour. For example, the Zhongyong ? whose ideology is based on the idea of interaction between heaven and man ? states: 'Therefore, given his great view, he had to gain the 386 [10]</page><page sequence="11">Changes' or Yijing, derived from various traditions and was further corroborated by Taoist and Buddhist tendencies. It influenced the Neo-Confucian system and was naturally to characterize popular thought deeply in late-imperial China. Although Taoist philosophy had stripped the idea of heaven of its mythical associations (45), retributive elements are found above all in its popular traditions, where health and longevity were regarded as the consequence of 'good' conduct but illness and misfortune as the proof of previous immorality. This concept of retribution was tied up not only with the individual's actions but also with those of his ancestors over a span of seven or nine generations. Examples of this attitude in the late Han and medieval periods are furnished by instances of chengfu, 'transmission of responsibility', documented in such works as the Taipingjing or 'Classic of the Great Peace'. Similarly, in the Baopuzi we again find belief in the influence of misconduct over the whole of the 'sinner's' life and that of his descendants (46). A fundamental concept is that of 'resonance' or 'correspondence', gan-ying (47). This idea is very ancient in China and envisages a particular concept of causality, neither linear nor unilateral but of a 'reticular and hierarchically fluctuating' type, as Needham so aptly describes it (48). As already pointed out in the work of Liu Yiqing (403-444) ? 'New throne, appanages, fame and long life' (17-2). And the Zuozhuan observes: 'On their birth, men receive life [...]. The capable cultivate the principles so as to ensure fortune, whereas the incapable violate them and meet with misfortune' (Zouzhuan, Chenggong, 13; cf. also Xigong, 23; Xuangong, 3; Zhaogong, 7; Zhuanggong, 11, 32). According to the Shujing (4, 4, 8; 4, 3, 2), 'He who acts rightly receives all the fortunes, while he who acts wrongly receive all the misfortunes' and 'The Way of heaven rewards good and punishes evil' (cf. also Legge, Confucian Analects. The Great Learning. The Doctrine of the Mean, p. 399; The Shoo King, pp. 198, 186). In the Lip, chapter Tangong, after being warned, the disciple of Confucius Zixia recognizes his faults as the cause of his blindness. The same attitude is also found in other schools. See for example in Han Feizi the chapters Yangquan and Jielao (Han Feizi jishi, Shanghai 1974, 2: 122, 6: 341) on the concept of retribution. While denying the Heavenly Mandate, Mozi bases his ethics on the 'heavenly will' (tianyi) and on heaven's retributive function. (45) However, the Daodejing at times attributes the heavens with a personal will and the ability to intervene in human affairs (see Daodejing, 67, 73, 79). While attributing the heavens with a physical nature and a character of inaction and denying the existence of a privileged relationship between heaven and man, understood as an infinitesimal part of the actual (see for example the comparison of man with the tip of a horsehair or with a drop of seawater in Zhuangzi, 17: 3-4; Zhuangzi jishi, pp. 294-95), Zhuangzi also presents destiny on occasion as an entity governing man's shifting fortunes (cf. Zhuangzi, 5: 13; Zhuangzi jishi, p. 114). In actual fact, the relationship between man and heaven is not denied for Taoists, but not at the ethical level. It consists neither in the affirmation nor in the negation of a moral tie, since it would be a pseudo-problem to inquire into the morality of destiny. Heaven acts independently of human will and criteria, but in the sage it is precisely heaven that operates through man. (46) Cf. Baopuzi neipian jiaoshi, Beijing 1985, 6: 125-27. For useful references concerning the concept of retribution, cf. Yan Lien-sheng, 'The Concept of Pao as a Basis for Social Relations in China', inj.

Needham, Science and Civilisation in China, Cambridge 1956, II, pp. 288-92, 304, in particular p. 289.

Gan and ying have been variously translated as 'influence and response', 'evocation and resonance', 'stimulus and reaction'. Gan can mean influence, emotion or affection, while ying stands for reaction, response, resonance or consequence as well as duty and necessity (53). They may be understood as human responses to influences occasioned by external events or conditions (54), or also as the consequences of human behaviour. They thus encompass both human responsibility and its effects in the world. The polemical broadsides delivered by Wang Chong (27-100) were directed, inter alia, against belief in the automatic linkage of good or bad actions with fortune or misfortune. This view was so widespread in his day that he returned to the subject several times: It is commonly claimed that those who do good meet with fortune and that those who do evil meet with misfortune; good luck or bad would thus always be the response of heaven [...]. The fortune and assistance that one may receive [from heaven] would derive from his good conduct, calamities and adversities from his wrongdoing. Whoever has hidden vices and faults would be punished by heaven and earth and receive punishment from the spirits. (55) Dong Zhongshu (179-104 B.C.) is responsible for the systematization and theoretical treatment of the retributive ideas prior to the Han dynasty and Sima Qian (49) Cf. Liu Yiqing, Shishuo xinyu jiaojian, Hong Kong 1987, 4: 61, p. 132; see also Needham, op. cit., II, p. 304. (50) The concept of stimulus and response between man and heaven is fundamental in this work, although at the same time the term heaven is normally understood as nature, with the connected motions and changes of terrestrial beings and heavenly bodies, and emphasis is given to the idea of yin, the 'knowledge of the physical and natural norms' (cf. Jiang Guozhu, op. cit., pp. 36-37). (51) For the concept of resonance, see also C. Le Blanc, Huai Nan Tzu. Philosophical Synthesis in Early Han Thought, Hong Kong 1985. The basic idea is that of correspondence between human order and natural order (tian yu ren xiang tong; ren nenggandong tian); man is a microcosm and reproduces heaven and its complexity within his small world: his four limbs correspond to the four seasons, the five entrails to the five elements, and so on up to certain atmospheric phenomena that find their counterparts in human emotions. (52) See for example Taishang ganying pian, whose ideas on the recompense and punishment of human behaviour and on the work of the spirits who mark down man's transgressions date back to earlier times. Cf. J. Legge, The Thai-shang Tractate of Actions and their Retributions, in Max Muller, ed., vols. 39-40, Oxford 1891 (repr. Delhi 1966), pp. 235-36. (53) Cf. A.S. Cua, 'Practical causation and Confucian ethics', Philosophy East and West, 25, 1975, p. 2. (54) Ibid.

In the latter's writings, heaven took on a religious significance and was regarded as manifesting itself in man's life, works, thought and feeling. It was the duty of the sovereign in particular to follow its dictates; failure to heed its warnings (qiangao) led to misfortune and disaster. Moreover, from the Han dynasty on, numerous pseudo-sciences began to develop in China seeking to investigate the future and to influence destiny. The flourishing of the ancient 'arts of divination' [shushu) and the compilation of many apocryphal texts foretelling the future led to the growth of studies on the interpretation of 'signs and emblems' (xiang)y 'numbers' or 'combinations' (shu) (57). The Chinese imagination is also peopled with demons and ghosts playing an important role in the sphere of belief in retribution. Numerous types of spirits come among men to seek revenge or to reward them for their goods deeds. While most of these spirits act 'privately', some are sent by heaven or the underworld 'on official missions' to carry out the decrees of retribution (58). In these cases, they are regarded as instruments of destiny or heaven whose task it is to punish or reward men for their merits or concealed demerits, yznzhi, as we may read in many tales (59). References to the good or evil done in previous existences with consequences in the present (sushan, suyuan) are thus also found in non-religious texts. An important role was also played in popular belief by the 'registers' supposedly kept by the heavenly emperor, the so-called 'Registers of good and evil' (60), 'Registers of life and death' or 'Registers of predestined marriages'. Generally speaking, it is possible to infer from these premises that an important role was played in classical and ancient Chinese thought by the concept of destiny bound up with personal and family responsibility and hence with the idea of retribution (61). This idea offered a 'rational' answer to the question of the causes of suffering and physical harm and forged a link between the moral sphere and practical and utilitarian necessities. This attitude was further consolidated by Buddhism. (56) Of particular significance is the attitude of Sima Qian, whose shifting between a predominantly fatalistic view and one that recognizes the consequences of human responsibility reflects the controversies of the beginning of the Han dynasty.

(59) Cf. for example Feng Menglong's Xingshi hengyan, Beijing 1986, 33: 731, where it is written that such hidden faults are accumulated imperceptibly but inexorably. (60) For an example of the representation of such registers in popular beliefs and in literature, see for instance chapters 8 and 9 of the 'Supplement to the Journey to the West' by Dong Yue (1620-1686). (61) For agnostic and rationalistic views, see the following sections. [13] 389</page><page sequence="14">3. Buddhist and Neo-Taoist Contributions In Buddhism the terms ganying, baoying, and yinguo refer to the functioning of karma, i.e. to the natural effects deriving from each action. In China, popular Buddhism created a system that was imaginary and functional at the same time. On the one hand, it eliminated any arbitrary reaction on the part of spirits or divinities and abolished economic and social differences between men before Buddhist Law. On the other, it envisaged a hierarchical pantheon of divinities with specific duties as regards observing human behaviour, drafting reports, and assigning punishment. As it has been pointed out, this system constituted a sort of divine 'bureaucratic monarchy' (62) that blended Buddhist and Taoist beliefs with Confucian-legalistic elements. Although modelled on the system actually operating in the Chinese empire and complementary to it, this institutional system of the underworld differed from the former in its basic egalitarianism, which found ideological precedent only in legalistic theory (63). Preexisting retributive conceptions were reinforced and developed by popular Taoism ? which could also be defined as 'the way to transform misfortune into fortune' (64) ? and by Buddhism, insofar as it furnished an adequate response to popular needs for justice and salvation (65). According to Taishang ganying pian, 'good and evil are recompensed in the same way as the shadow follows the body which casts it. Thus, in the heavens and on earth there are spirits who note man's misdeeds (66). This belief envisages a chronological register for each man in which his merits and demerits are listed. When the latter reach a certain number, the divinities send misfortune upon the sinner (67). Even a man's life span may thus be reduced to a greater or lesser extent in relation to his conduct, and if his debt to universal justice is not completely paid off, retribution is carried over to his descendants. It is therefore no surprise to find moral advice combined with expectations of fortune also in Neo-Confucian writings. In the 'Diagram of the mind' in the well (62) Cf. W. Eberhard, Guilt and Sin in Traditional China, Berkeley-Los Angeles 1967, pp. 18-21. (63) Ibid., p. 115. (64) Cf. Baopuzi neipian jiaoshi, 6: 127. (65) For influences on literature, see D.

Brokaw, 'Y?an Huang (1533-1606) and the Ledgers of Merit and Demerit', HJAS, 47, 1, 1987, pp. 144-45. (67) As it says in the late Tang period work Yaoxiu keyi liichao, 12: 10a-11a: 'When a man's faults number more than 120, he falls ill. [...] At the number 190, the matter becomes more serious: the man will be struck down by an epidemic'. Reward and punishment reflected the seriousness and the amount of faults committed quantified in numerical terms. Cf. Brokaw, op. cit., p. 146. 390 [14]</page><page sequence="15">known Neo-Confucian compendium Xingli daquan, a list of vices is followed by the warning: 'He who follows this course, daily drifts into deeper corruption, and finally becomes a beast or monster. Evil stars glare on him, and calamity overtakes him' (68). Jinsilu reports the following statement by Zhou Dunyi: 'The superior man cultivates these moral qualities and enjoys good fortune, whereas the inferior man violates them and suffers ill fortune' (69). And in the same compilation, a quotation from Cheng Yi takes up the question of the role played by human responsibility and of man's ability to influence destiny through 'resonance' (70). It is interesting to compare these assertions with texts in which concepts of popular religion are expressed, where the concept of human responsibility is a recurrent theme (71). In the late Ming period, the monk Zhuhong (1535-1615), who promoted an active Buddhist movement, made use of a great number of anecdotes of magic and miracle working, similar to those reported in the rich literature of 'annotations' or biji of the time. His writings sought to spread Buddhist ethics and to recall that good actions would always be rewarded by means of examples drawn from historical annotations, legends, contemporary events and personal experience. Most of his advice centred on the precept concerning respect for all living beings (such as freeing animals, fangsheng) but also dealt with all kinds of charitable and socially useful actions. His writings sought to convince people that the merits resulting from good deeds were a source of prestige, longevity, health, fortune, prosperity, success and offspring (72). This tradition has continued down to the present. For example, among the cartoons published by the Dianshizhai Pictorial at the end of the 19th century, it is possible to find the punishment of a butcher, boiling in the same cauldron as the ox he had slaughtered, before the eyes of his heavenly judges. As is known, Buddhist ethics prohibit the killing of living beings and give bovines particular respect among animals. It is, in fact, no coincidence that the status of a butcher in China was among the most humble in category of the 'lowly' jianmin. Entitled 'a just punishment for the killing [of an ox]', Hao sha zhi bao, the tale is as follows. In accordance with the designs of the heavenly constellations, the humble ox was placed on earth to plow the fields for the benefit of mankind. It is for this reason that there are many strict prohibitions against killing them. Nonetheless, it is not uncommon to find people slaughtering oxen illegally and selling the flesh at high prices.

[15] 391</page><page sequence="16">Alas, the unspeakable injustice wrought upon the innocent ox can well be imagined when one considers that their slaughterers are the very same people who have exploited them in life. Yet it would be wrong to think that of all nature's creatures, the ox alone does not resent the pain and suffering it endures, and has no dreams of revenge. One day, a butcher in the Dongguan district of Tongzhou purchased an old ox for slaughter. As he was leading the beast down the street to the abattoir, the ox became frightened and refused to proceed, and it was only by tying a rope through its nose and tugging with all his might that the butcher was able to get the creature to move. As they passed through the commercial district of the town, the ox suddenly stopped in front of a bank, and when the employees of the bank came out to see what was going on, the ox went down on its knees and refused to budge any further. Tears welled up in its eyes, and the mute creature looked as though it were appealing for help. The clerks took pity on it, and offered to buy it from the butcher to spare the animal's life, but he refused. The clerks, then, offered him a higher amount, but the butcher refused once again, claiming that this particular ox had an evil nature, and that he wouldn't be content until it was dead. 'If you offered me ten-thousand strings of cash, I still wouldn't do as you wish'. He said angrily. The ox appeared to have understood the tenor of their conversation, and collapsed to the ground. Minutes later it rose to its feet, and submissively followed the butcher to the sloughter-house. The butcher killed the ox and as was his custom cooked its flesh in a cauldron in his courtyard. The butcher would get up at the fifth watch to inspect the cauldron, but on that particular evening, not a single sound could be heard in the courtyard after the fifth watch had passed. The butcher's wife thought this strange, and went with candle in hand to take a look at the cauldron. She was horrified to discover her husband being stewed inside the cauldron, whith his legs sticking out in the air and his head and torso cooked to a pulp along with the ox he had slaughtered. People said that considering the butcher's taste for slaughter, this was a just form of punishment. (73) These stories have retained their great popularity, numerous publications on such subjects still being found in Chinese bookshops in the 1980s. For example, the volume by He Tong brought out by a Buddhist publishing house deals at length with the theory and reality of retribution, dwelling particularly on the concept of cause and effect in the fields of morals and wordly success, and describes numerous edifying cases from different times and places (74).

The 'Three Doctrines' and the 'Moral Books' All those who study deeply seek the reasons for life and death and investigate the sources of their nature and destiny. [...] To say that the sages of the Three Doctrines are different is truly absurd. The first formula of the Taoists is 'Oh ? another cry'; the first formula of the Buddhists is 'Before birth'; and the first formula of the Confucians is 'Before the manifestation [of the emotions]'. Are they identical or not? He who is sincere with regard to his nature and destiny will understand by himself, without words, the reason why the sages of the three Doctrines are identical lies in their respect for nature and destiny. (75) Despite their rationalistic attitude, which will be dealt with at length in the following two sections, Neo-Confucian thinkers did not totally eschew concessions to the popular idea of retribution and to certain beliefs which Confucian ideology rejected as superstitious. The reasons for this include both religious and practical considerations. In fact, we must overlook neither the importance of the influence exercised by the doctrines that entered into the syncretic Neo-Confucian system, nor the instrumental use made of popular beliefs in order to spread and uphold morality among the people. For example, Han Yu, a forerunner of Neo-Confucianism and a severe critic of Buddhism, had recourse to belief in spirits, gui, as instruments of cosmic justice: 'Those who, moved by passion, rebel against heaven, damage their neighbour, bring harm to beings and to things, and offend against social relations are punished with misfortune and disaster (76). In such cases, belief in spirits is used to warn the people against moral transgression and spirits become the tools used by destiny and heaven to restore justice in the world. In his interpretation of two controversial passages from the 'Classic of Documents' (Shujing) and the 'Classic of Changes' (Yijing), Zhu Xi, the most authoritative exponent of Neo-Confucianism, regarded heavenly reward and punishment as consequences of action and the intervention of positive and negative energies, shen gui, as instrumental in the distribution of each person's deserts: joy and sorrow are the consequences of respect for or violation of the principles governing the universe. [...] What is said by Shujing, 'Heavenly Way brings happiness to the good and misfortune to the evil', and by Yijing, 'gui and shen harm the proud and benefit the modest' are conform to this idea: the proud opposes the principle, and therefore obviously deserves hardness, while the modest follows the principle, and therefore obviously deserves blessing [...].

[17] 393</page><page sequence="18">The role of the so-called Three Doctrines (sanjiao) (78) in relation to the retributive ideology is underlined above all in two types of source: vernacular literature (79) and the 'moral books' or shanshu. The shanshu, and especially the genre of gongguoge ? i.e. 'Norms [for the annotation of] merits and demerits' or 'Registers of merits and demerits' ? whose origins date back to some centuries earlier, were very common works containing moral teaching together with tables of merits and demerits. W.A.P. Martin divides these books into four types: 1) those which advocate morality in general; 2) those which enjoin the practice of particular virtues; 3) those which warn against particular vices; 4) and those written for a specific religion (80). Although they made their first appearance under the Song dynasty, it was not until the Ming period that they were published and distributed on a vast scale. After the works of Yuan Huang in particular, many new texts were written, a dozen of which published in the 17th century have survived till today (81). The chief merit of Yuan Huang and of Yungu (Fahui, 1500-1579) lay in rearranging these texts and imbuing them with a new spirit. By giving them a Confucian form, these scholars universalized the system of merits and demerits and broadened their audience. At the same time, their emphasis on the active role played by man with regard to destiny and their shifting of expectations for reward and punishment from the next world to this helped foster the spread of these texts through all levels of the population (82). By comparison with earlier specimens, the moral books and registers of the Ming period were more attentive to the actual circumstances of human behaviour and showed greater sensitivity towards social and economic differences. Though compiled and commented upon by scholars, they had as their objective the moral education of the masses and were read by people from all classes of society. These works constitute the clearest example of the ideology of the Three Doctrines in that they incorporate beliefs, ceremonies and values belonging to Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. For example, Li Zhi's Yinguo lu or 'Registration of causes and effects' combines the law of karma, which constitutes the fundamental moral of the stories related there, with (78) A new syncretic tendency may be ascribed to Wang Yangming, many of whose disciples and followers gave a strong impulse towards the re-affirmation of the Three Doctrines. For syncretism subsequent to Wang Yangming and its various forms, see E. Ch'ien, Chiao Hung and the Restructuring ofNeo-Confucianism in the Late Ming, New York 1986, and J. Beding, The Syncretic Religion of Lin Chao en, New York 1980. (79) All the most important popular Chinese novels are based on the retributive conception, even though ? as Plaks points out (The Four Masterworks of the Ming Novel. Ssu ta ch'i-shu, op. cit. ? this basis is often inadequate for the work's overall economy and confines itself to performing a largely decorative function. (80) Cf. Martin, The Lore of Cathay, op. cit., pp. 148-49. (81) For a list of the above-mentioned texts, see Brokaw, op. cit., p. 142. (82) Cf. ibid., p. 142. 394 [18]</page><page sequence="19">Taoist and Confucian values. In the same way, the 'Diary of Self-knowledge' {Zizhi lu) by Zhuhong, a promoter of the diffusion of shanshu or 'moral books', included among the meritorious actions many Confucian virtues, such as filial piety, loyalty on the part of the subject and justice, as well as Buddhist virtues like compassion for all living beings and support for monks; mention was even made of respect for printed paper (83). The recommendations of all these books as regards charitable works and donations to monasteries took into account the real resources of people of different social condition. For example, we read that 'in general, the expenditure of a hundred copper coins has the same worth as a meritorious action. But if the same meritorious action is performed by a poor person, the amount of merit increases in proportion to his degree of poverty. In the case of a man in conditions of extreme misery, his expenditure of no more than five or ten coins will be worth the hundred coins spent by a rich man (84). Among other things, Yuan Huang recommended the virtue of modesty, qianxu, as making it possible to acquire merit without incurring expense (85). Moreover, the emphasis upon specific duties varied in accordance with one's functions and profession. The most typical Confucian virtues were demanded particularly of literary persons, whereas craftsmen were urged to be serious in their work, and merchants to be honest. Honesty, reciprocity and harmony were prescribed for other groups (86). As we have seen, these norms condemned the killing of any living being, theft, falsehood, fornication, wrath, waste and gambling. Comments and examples were often inserted to provide concrete illustration of the positive or negative consequences of one's behaviour. This type of literature provides a clear example of one of the most common attitudes towards evil, i.e. the possibility of creating an equilibrium to neutralize the effects of sin, to compensate for offence and loss, to balance faults with the merits of good deeds, and even to transfer merit, huixiang (87). The general principle was based on the axiom that 'the accumulation of good (of merit) leads to good, and the accumulation of evil (of demerits) leads to evil', '/* shan feng shan, ji e feng ey (88). These texts were thus comparable to guides by means of which it was (83) Cf. Y? Ch?n-fang, op. cit., pp. 104-6. (84) Cf. Huizuan gongguoge, 8: 25a-26b; cit. in Tadao Sakai, 'Confucianism and Popular Educational Works', in Th. De Bary, ed., Self and Society in Ming Thought, New York-London 1970, p. 351. (85) Cf.

(87) From the Buddhist theory of parin?man?, which provides for the transfer of merit in two senses: the transfer of merits accumulated by oneself to other persons (zhongsheng huixiang) or their utilization on the path to nirvana iputi huixiang). This belief was so strong among the Chinese that those who converted to Christianity probably believed that the offerings made could free the deceased from the torments not only of purgatory but also of hell. Cf. J. Gernet, China and the Christian Impact. A Conflict of Cultures, Cambridge-Paris 1985, p. 95. (88) Cf. in the fields of literature Feng Menglong's Gujin xiaoshuo, Beijing 1979, 26: 402.

For example, in order to balance the demerits derived from having caused the death of a human being (100 demerits or units of negative value), it was necessary to accumulate the same amount of merits, e.g. by saving two human lives (50 merits each) (90). The fear of ending up 'in the red' became one of the most common attitudes with regard to violations of the law. During the Ming dynasty, these texts thus enjoyed great popularity: their scales and tables exemplified the ontological contrast between the principle of good and selfish desires and made it possible to perform quick and easy calculations by registering good or bad thoughts and actions over a given period. The other characteristic of these works lay in the practical and worldly attitude they applied to the principle of retribution. In the general norms relating to the various commandments, the threats of punishment and promises of reward also in one's present life often appear to follow the law of an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. As the commentary on Shijie gongguoge put it: 'He who fully obeys the commandment of respect for life obtains the retribution of a long life and numerous male offspring [...]. He who fully obeys the commandment of respect for the goods of others obtains as retribution all that he desires [...]. He who fully obeys the commandment of respect for others obtains the respect of his fellows (91). This attitude was so deeply rooted among the common people as to be found often in popular literature. A story of the late Ming period describes the case of a woman who left her husband because he was poor and unlucky. While criticizing this way of judging a person on the basis of his success, the author nevertheless remarks that one should not be surprised at the episode in that the attitude is widespread throughout the world, shi qing jie ran (92). More light is cast on the subject by another story. Yuan Huang confessed to the monk Yungu his possession of faults that would make it impossible for him to pass his higher examinations and to have a child. Before urging him to change his ways in order to modify his destiny, the monk enunciated the general principle of retribution, which appears to differ little from the view mentioned by Feng Menglong: Those who deserve a thousand taels' worth of property are surely people who have (89) As Erasmus was to complain in his In Praise of Folly, a similar phenomenon arose in Renaissance Europe among those who used double-entry book keeping to keep accounts of the punishments they would have to undergo for their sins and those they regarded as forgiven thanks to indulgences (Erasmo da Rotterdam, Elogio della pazzia, Torino 1978, p. 67). (90) See for example Shijie gongguoge (pp. 3, 8, in Daozang jiyao, pp. 10312, 10314). See also van Gulik, Sexual Life in Ancient China, Leiden 1974, p. 246. (91) Cf.

Those who deserve one hundred taels' worth of property are surely people who have one hundred taels. Those who should starve to death are surely people who do starve to death. Heaven bestows favors simply according to a man's own quality. When did it ever add the slightest bit more than he deserves. (93) Referring to the predictions that Yuan Huang had previously heard from another monk, Yungu asserted a type of 'active predestination' (94) that, mutatis mutandis, recalls Calvinist ethics. While the latter saw the conditions of life as constituting signs of divine predestination, Yungu held that man could alter his destiny through his behaviour: Master Kong's prediction that you would not pass the examination for the juren degree is a prediction of a calamity sent by heaven; you can still avoid it. If you now extend the inborn goodness of your nature, exert yourself to do good deeds, and accumulate a large store of hidden virtue, this is good fortune you are making yourself. How can you not take advantage of it? (95) This simplification and 'automatization' of the moral problem and the question of destiny is difficult to categorize. On the one hand, it reflects a moral inspiration and a rational effort to explain good or bad fortune, advocating a rigorous morality for everyday life. On the other, it tends to reduce conscience and responsibility to a utilitarian calculation closer to the economic sphere than to ethical conscience and reminiscent of the religious practices stigmatized by St Paul in the Sermones. This aspect is but one manifestation of the practical and utilitarian attitude of the Chinese (96). (93) Cf. Yuan Huang, Liming pian, 4a, transl. in Brokaw, op. cit., p. 165. (94) There are numerous examples with analogous characteristics, such as the case of Wei Xi (1624-1681) who, in despair at his lack of offspring, turned to a Taoist divinity, promising to cultivate the virtues seriously: '[...] Day after day I shall intensify the cultivation of myself and the practice of examining my conscience. Although everything is predestined, great acts of goodness are always capable of altering the course of events. Even criminals can move the spirits by the slightest sign of sincerity'. (My italics. Cf. Wei Shuzi wenji, 6: 2736; transl. Wu Pei-yi, The Confucian's Progress. Autobiographical Writings in Traditional China, Princeton 1990, p. 226). In this case too we find repentance, a vow, faith in retribution and an active conception of destiny. Also present is a syncretic and ambiguous attitude on the part of the writer, as is revealed in a postscript dated 1663, in which the author justifies this action in terms of his dual attitude: veneration towards the divinity together with scepticism as to the effectiveness of the act (cf. ibid., 6: 2738 and Wu Pei-yi, p. 227).

The Acceptance of Destiny Destiny establishes fame or humility) one lives and dies according to the principle. It is right to be satisfied with destiny and to submit to the principle. (97) In the Chinese tradition, individual destiny and personal emotions ? for which Confucianism had little value ? were given great attention by authors of Taoist tendencies. Numerous references to destiny and to how one should behave with regard to one's destiny are thus found not only in philosophical treatises but also in literary works. What we may call a 'stoic' type of response is found in a great many poetical works, including the allegorical poem by Tao Qian (365-427) entitled 'The form, the shadow and the spirit' (Xing ying shen) (98), where the Taoist ideal of achieving serenity (99) is contrasted with hedonistic pleasure-seeking and with Confucian ambition and commitment: [...] Substance speaks to Shadow: Heaven and Earth exist for ever; Mountains and rivers never change. But herbs and trees in perpetual rotation Are renovated and withered by the dews and frosts; And Man the wise, Man the divine ? Shall he alone escape this law? Fortuitously appearing for a moment in the World He suddenly departs, never to return. Who will notice there is one person less? His friends and relations will not give him a thought. Only when they chance on the things he used Day in day out, do their spirit sink for a while. Me no magical arts can save; Of that I am certain and cannot ever doubt, I beg you listen to this advice ? (97) Liu Xun (1240-1319), Shuiyuncun gao, 8: 12a-b, cit. in Wu Pei-yi, op. cit., p. 29. (98) Cf. Tao Yuanming shixuan, pp. 15-21; transl. Arthur Waley, London 1946, pp. 102-3. On the other hand, apart from such rare cases as the passage from Liezi on Destiny and Effort cited above, China provides no allegories on destiny fo the type widespread in western culture (e.g. the Danse aux aveugles by Pierre Michauld, which represents Love, Fortune and Death together, Boiardo's Orlando innamorato, which combines the Fata Morgana, Chance and Destiny in a single character, or Monteverdi's Ritomo di Ulisse, in which human frailty is sung by a trio composed of Fortune, Time and Love). (") See the conception of the unity of destiny and human nature in Zhuangzi, and that of complete adaptation to the evolution of reality (cf. T'ang Ch?n-i, op. cit., Philosophy East and West, 12, 1, 1962, pp. 37-42). 398 [22]</page><page sequence="23">When you get wine, be sure to drink it.

[...] [23] 399</page><page sequence="24">The acceptance of destiny is often distinguished from passive fatalism in that it does not rule out active human intervention to modify or improve conditions at both the social and the personal level. When man is aware that a certain situation does not depend upon his will or his behaviour, or that conditions are not yet ripe, he should accept reality with tranquillity and not allow his mind to be troubled by its difficulties. In the sphere of philosophical thought, the return to Confucianism could not ignore this problem. It is in this sense that we should interpret the exhortations of Li Ao (? c. 844), who invoked the authority of the Yijing (10?) and recommended conforming to destiny. The sage was thus free from worry on the one hand, and on the other possessed the power to cooperate in the transformation of the world through his virtue of humanity. [The sage] rejoices in heaven and understand destiny; so he has no worries. Peaceful in his position, he cherishes humanity, and so has the ability to love. He comprehends in his scope the transformations of heaven and earth, without any error. (101) More than two centuries later, Shao Yong (1011-1077) was to give the following ontological formulation of these concepts: 'Events, be they great or small, bear the Way within them. The ability to accept one's condition is called the Way, while inability to accept it is called absence of the Way' (102). Similar concepts were expressed by Cheng Yi in another passage: At the time of difficulty, if the superior man has done his best to prevent it, but cannot avoid it, that is the fate. He should investigate his fate to the utmost in order to fulfill his aim. When he knows that according to the fate the situation should be so, his mind will not be disturbed by poverty, obstacles, or calamity. He will merely act according to what is right. If he does not know his fate, he will be afraid when he encounters danger or difficulty and stumble when he suffers poverty, and what he holds on to will be lost. How can he fulfill his aim to do good? (103) Similar recommendations were also made by Fang Xiaoru (1357-1402), urging the 'acceptance of destiny' as it was by reason of its inscrutability and referring (10?) Yijing, Xici, a, 4. Cf. J. Legge, The I Ching. The Book of Changes, New York 1963, p. 354; R. Wilhelm, I king, Roma 1950, p. 546. (101) Li Ao, Fuxing shu, in Li wengong ji, (Sibu congkan) 2: 9. Compare this passage with the far more restrictive stoic proposition: 'Ducunt volentem fata, nolentem trahunt' (Seneca, AdLuciL, 107.11). According to Stoics, society cannot be either governed or refused, because it belongs to Fate's will. The Stoic's duty is only to play well the part allotted to him (therefore the way and intention are more important of contents); he lives passions and vices of his society like any other man, but he does not let passions overwhelm him and does not identify himself with his character. (102) Shao Yong, Huangji jingshi, 8b: 29. (103) Jinsilu jijie, 7: 207; Chan Wing-tsit, Reflections on Things at Hand..., op. cit., p. 188. 400 [24]</page><page sequence="25">back to the well-known anming formula: The scholars must know what destiny is. Human ambitions have no limits, but what we have is limited. This is destiny. If it were possible to achieve wealth and honour through wisdom, Confucius and Mencius would have been sovereigns. [...] Destiny does not always correspond to man's intentions. If we accept destiny, we will enjoy abundance. If we act against it, we will fall into penury. (104) The above views are not so far removed from the concept of 'pure vacuity' [qingxu) and the idea of serenity {dan) found in Huang Daozhou (1585-1646) (105). Like many of his contemporaries, Wang Yangming recommended devoting oneself to self cultivation without worrying about things lying beyond human control: success or failure, longevity or brevity of life. He developed concepts already expressed by Mencius while at the same time making a sharp distinction between matters in the field of ethics and those regarding destiny: As to allowing no double-mindedness regardless of longevity or brevity of life, it is to teach the student to do good with single-mindedness, and not to allow success or failure, longevity or brevity of life, to shake his determination to do good, but instead to cultivate his personal life and wait for fate to take its own course, realizing that success and failure, or longevity or brevity of life, are matters of fate and one need not unnecessarily allow them to disturb his mind. (106) However, these views are to be understood as a goal, as an objective often still remote rather than as a general attitude. The acceptance of destiny frequently remains an unachieved ideal of wisdom and one felt all the more deeply through its conscious or unconscious comparison with the existing state of dissatisfaction. A good example of this is provided by the poem on destiny (Shiming) by Li Mengyang (1473-1529), which contrasts what is regarded as the natural tendency to love one's condition of life and surroundings with the dissatisfaction of those who pursue wealth and fame. However, despite the author's intentions, glimpses of his own deep-rooted dissatisfaction emerge in verses such as those dealing with the sorrow of the superior man, the sad songs and nocturnal laments, poverty and solitude (107).

A similar distinction between the world of morality, depending on human nature and will, and the world of success, wealth and health, depending on chance and fortune, is found in the Dialogo de Fortuna (1521) by Fregoso, where it is written that fortune and the stars influence bodies but not souls, passion but not virtue (cf. J. Delumeau, Le peche et la peur. La culpahilisation en Occident, XHIe-XVIIIe siecle, Paris 1983; Italian transl.: II peccato e la paura.

(108) In any case, it is clear that the tendency to 'accept' destiny, however one conceived it, may be regarded as a constant factor in Chinese thought and could be subsumed within the more general pragmatic and realistic attitude. With regard to the ethical evaluation of destiny, however, and to the relation between guilt, death and pain, the traditional standpoint is far more varied and complex. After our brief examination of the retributive strand, we shall now deal with the others. In many intellectual circles, the correlation between behaviour and fortune had been rejected on principle ? possibly due to the strong tradition of rationalism that had established itself in the course of Chinese history ? but was then reintroduced in more or less obvious ways. If we look back into the history of Chinese thought, however, some propositions are significant for the strong rationalist tendency they display: 'life and death depend on destiny (ming); wealth and rank are determined by heaven', as it is written in Lunyu. This was no generic, fatalistic assertion. From the context there is a clear distinction between the course of destiny ? which cannot be determined by man ? and the life of the sage, whose complete independence is affirmed (109). Confucius ignored all prospect of supernatural reward or punishment and praised self-perfection in itself, urging its pursuit even at the expense of personal interests. He asserted that 'wealth and prestige correspond to man's desires; but if they cannot be attained correctly, they must be abandoned. Poverty and lowly social condition are what man detests; but if they cannot rightly be avoided, they must not be rejected' (no). Mencius was to be still more explicit in rejecting all hope of reward and all fear of punishment in the performance of one's duties. He formulated a rational view of destiny which saw it as independent of man's will and of reasonable caution (m). Destiny was therefore to be accepted with neither reservation nor complaint (112), and one's self-perfection was not to be influenced by any hope or fear of future reward or punishment (113). Longevity, prestige and wealth had no relation to self-cultivation. He who achieves full awareness of his mind understands nature. The understanding O Yijing. Appendix III, 22. Cf.

Be his life long or short, he does not hesitate in his self cultivation and so establishes [his] destiny, liming. [...] That which we obtain with our investigation and lose through our negligence [virtue] is worthy of pursuit and must be sought within ourselves. That which [wealth, dignity and fortune] we obtain by methodical endeavour, and that which we receive from destiny, is not worthy of pursuit and lies outside us. (114) The retributive conception of the Celestial Mandate was itself so far-reaching that it could not be dismissed as an irrational, idealistic doctrine. How could one deny the importance of 'consensus' for the prosperity of the state and the repercussions of good or bad government on agriculture and the economy? In any case, the influence upon destiny attributed to the stars and to the five elements constituted an attempt to offer a naturalistic and pseudo-scientific explanation. Neither could the problem of consensus be overlooked by Xunzi Mencius' rival, despite his far more realistic and pessimistic view of the real nature of mankind. In any case, Xunzi rejected all temptation to embrace the retributive view of destiny and drew a clear distinction between the natural world and the world of human affairs, despite his exhaltation of the rites as universal principles. The sky represented physical nature with the alternation of the seasons, the stars, atmospheric phenomena, the birth and death of the various beings that populate the earth; in short, all the natural transformations brought about by the spontaneous mutation of energy. However, none of this had any influence on the organization of social life, which was included among the tasks of mankind, nor could man's behaviour alter the course of natural phenomena or bring about disaster, calamity or famine. Notwithstanding the references made above to the texts of the Daodejing and the Zhuangzi, a no less sceptical and rationalistic attitude is found in the Taoist view that 'heaven and earth are devoid of humanity' (116) in the sense that the universe is amoral and indifferent to human fate and behaviour. In the Liezi, destiny (tianyun) is spontaneous and fortuitous and so there exists no superior will with its own ends: longevity or brevity of life are not ordained, just as cereals were not created in order to feed man. All teleological reasoning is absurd, just as it would be absurd to believe that man was created in order that mosquitoes might feed upon his blood and wild (114) Cf. Mencius 7a, 1-3. The same interpretation is confirmed by Zhu Xi in his comment on Mencius. Cf. Zhuzi yulei, 60: 1422-35; Mengzi zbaozbu, 13: la-2b. Worth noting, several Hellenistic philosophers contrasted the freedom of 'what is by us', that safeguards human responsibility, with destiny, that tends to reduce man to slavery (cf. Epicurus, Epistola a Meneceo, G. Arrighetti, ed., Torino 1973, pp. 133-34, or Chrysippus' theory of internal and external causes). Their main purpose of serching for internal freedom, however, differs from Mencius' more practical aims. (115) Consider the metaphor comparing the king to a boat and the people to the water (cf. Xunzi, Wangzhi). (116) Cf. Daodejing, 5: Tiandi bu ren. [27] 403</page><page sequence="28">beasts upon his flesh (117). Wang Bi (226-249) confirmed the view that heaven and earth generate the beings of the universe spontaneously in accordance with an obscure destiny {mingyun). Such reflections also gave rise to the negation of the existence of what was commonly defined as natural and physical evil, in that this would form part of the natural process of creation and re-creation, rise and decay, life and death. It is within this perspective that we should place such views as those attributed to Yang Wangsun, according to which death is only the necessary and natural consequence of birth (118), i.e. a perspective laying particular emphasis on the naturalistic aspect of each event to advocate the simple acceptance of everything, death included. Far removed from the retributive viewpoint are also the attitudes displayed in the complaint against the injustice of heaven made in some of the compositions in the 'Classic of the Odes' (119) or in some passages from the commentaries on the 'Springs and Autumns', in which a distrust of heavenly intervention is expressed (120). As Robert Eno has acutely demonstrated, the perception of the 'injustice of Heaven' was a turning point in the elaboration of more sophisticated concepts of heaven. The decadence of the Zhou order and the collapse of traditional social values contributed to the weakening of the religious belief in an ethically prescriptive Heaven. 'The fall of Tian raised an issue capable of stimulating a transformation of religious thought to philosophy. [...] The task was to find the "real" values, ones that restored to Tian its prescriptive perfection. Finding a new point of view from which even a chaotic world made moral sense was necessary' (121). This was Confucius' task, but the first (117) Cf. Liezi, (Ershi'erzi, Shanghai 1983, 8: 221. See in particular the chapter on destiny providing some paradoxical historical examples in. which virtue is not accompanied by any practical advantage (longevity, wealth, power) or cases in which the injustice of destiny is evident (as in the anecdote of Beigongzi and Ximenzi or of the two men as alike as twin brothers, Liezi, 6: 213-14). This presents a dialogue between Destiny and Human Effort in which the latter asks the former: Tf all that lies within your power, for what purpose have you granted long life to one and short life to another, brought the sage to failure and the rebel to success, misery to the good and fortune to the wicked, the worthy man to humiliation and the fool to glory?'. However, destiny itself has no individual personality of its own and is not the author of man's good or bad fortunes. It merely executes a spontaneous process [of 'auto longevity' or 'auto-fortune']. After which the following objection is raised against retributive theories (and reiterated explicitly in the commentary): 'If life and death did not depend upon destiny, the virtuous and the wise should enjoy longevity while a short life would be the lot of the wicked and the foolish. But this is not so. [...] If poverty and wealth did not depend upon the times, the parsimonious should be rich and the spendthrift poor. But this is not so'. (Cf. Liezi, 6: 215). (118) Cf. Hanshu, Hong Kong 1970, 67: 2908. (119) As one of the odes of the Xiaoya laments: 'Oh immense heavens [...] all these innocents are overwhelmed by ruin!' (Shijing, Xiaoya, 4 [Qifu]: 10). Or again: 'What crimes have men committed now, that heaven sends misfortune and famine?' (Shijing, Daya, 3 [Tang]: 4). (120) Among the views negating the existence of a relation between man and heaven in antithesis to those expressed in Zhongyong, readers will recall the comment made in the 18th year of the Duke of Chao: 'The way of heaven is distant, while the way of man is near'. (121) Cf. Eno, op. cit., pp. 27-28. 404 [28]</page><page sequence="29">Confucians' political failure raised again the problem to rationally fill the gap between Tian as a moral value standard and Tian as an efficient cause of amoral events, in other words between a normative concept and a descriptive concept of heaven. The solution was found in the context of a teleological plan (122), and destiny acquired the ambiguous and double meaning of moral inner rule and of external fate. No comment is called for in the case of the rational criticism of Wang Chong (27-100), who developed some arguments put forward by Xunzi and other concepts of Taoist origin. His theory is based on a sharp distinction between human nature and destiny, between ethics and life: Nature and destiny are different. While one may have a good nature and an unhappy destiny, on the contrary, another may have a bad nature and a happy destiny. Goodnesss and badness of behaviour depend upon nature, but good and bad fortune, propitious events and calamities, depend upon destiny. If one behaves well and if afflicted by misfortune, this depends on his good nature and unfortunate destiny. If another behaves badly and enjoys good fortune, this depends on his bad nature and fortunate destiny. In itself, nature may be good or bad, just as destiny may be good or bad in itself. Even if a fortunate person neglects good, he will not necessarily lose his good luck; on the contrary, even if an unfortunate person employs all his strength, he cannot necessarily avoid misfortunate. (123) Wang Chong thus categorically ruled out the possibility that success and failure, good and bad fortune, might depend upon man's moral conduct and identified destiny with chance. As he went on to assert: In conducting affairs men may be either talented or stupid, but when it comes to calamity or good fortune, there are some who are lucky and some unlucky. The things they do may be right or wrong, but whether they meet with reward or punishment depends on chance [...]. There are many persons who wish to display their loyalty [to a ruler], yet he rewards some and punishes others; there are many who wish to do him benefit, yet he trusts some and distrusts others. Those whom he rewards and trusts are not necessarily the true ones, nor are those whom he punishes and distrusts necessarily the false. It is simply that the rewarded and trusted ones are lucky, while those who are punished and distrusted are unlucky. (124) Wang Chong's criticism of belief in the existence of a relationship between human conduct and natural phenomena is well known, despite his acceptance of astrology (122) Ibid., pp. 82-88, 214, fn. 44. (123) Cf. Wang Chong, Lunheng, Mingyi bian, Shanghai 1974, 2: 6. (124) Cf. Lunheng, Xin'ou bian, 2: 1; transl. Yang Lien-sheng, 'The Concept of Pao as a Basis for Social Relations in China', inj.

Wang saw every event or situation as the product of fortuitous conjunctions and destiny as therefore completely independent of moral and political facts. Destiny could thus be regarded as 'amoral': 'Life and death depend solely upon the longevity or brevity of existence ordined by destiny; they have no relationship with the morality or immorality of one's conduct. The maintenance or collapse of states thus depends solely upon the length of the duration assigned to them, and not upon the success or failure of their governments (126). This rational and sceptical attitude towards the various 'superstitions' was carried on by Zhongchang Tong (179-219) and by Wang Yan (256-311), in a period when Confucianism was on the wane and Taoism predominated. In the Tang era, the treatises written on heaven (Tiamhuo and Tianlun) by Liu Zongyuan (773-819) and Liu Yuxi (772-842) respectively asserted the naturalistic character of the universe and its lack of any relationship with human destinies or with states (127). Similar ideas are found in many other sources including, for the period under examination, the Zhedong school at the beginning of the Ming era. Particular interest was shown in the subject by Song Lian (128), Liu Ji and Wang Wei. According to Song Lian, even death was not an evil in itself, especially if it arrived after a long life, if there were offspring to guarantee the continuation of the family, and if a certain wealth was left for relatives and for the funeral rites. Underlying his fundamental viewpoint was the principle that 'life and death belong to destiny; man cannot escape his destiny. Why are the common people so afraid of it?' (129). It was the same principle that caused Li Ruzhen to write in Jinghuayuan, at the beginning of the 19th century, that it was foolish to worry about death since worry shortened one's life span (13?). Two phases should be distinguished in Liu Ji. In the first, under the influence of the Gongyang school and the teaching of Dong Zhongshu, he asserted a close interrelation between man and nature, between man and heaven [tianren ganying); in the second he repudiated his former retributive views for a more rationalist standpoint in which the heavens were denied will or understanding and misfortune was ascribed to factors of various types. However, man still retained the power to control nature (125) Wang Chong believed that individual destinies depended on the 'spiritual essence' (jingshen) of man's constitution (xing), on the influence of the stars as manifested in celestial signs (xiang), and on fate. Each type of constitution possessed by an individual had its own characteristics and could thus be examined, as could the stellar signs. Cf.

Particularly significant in this connection is the passage from Liu Ji's Yulizi cited in a previous paper (132). In two other essays 'on heaven' and 'on thunder', Liu Ji again denies heaven's ability to intervene positively or negatively in human society, but draws a further conclusion representing a compromise between his rationalistic starting point and the theory of retribution. He does not deny that heaven loves good and hates evil, but asserts its impotence to intervene in human affairs. It is energy that determines the real conditions obtaining in the world, and energy may be good but also bad. Thus, while good energy permits good to manifest itself, bad energy produces evil. And great changes derive from its oscillation between yin and yang. When it is under the negative influence, universal order collapses, giving rise to a series of imbalances with repercussions also on the earth. A series of natural calamities follow one upon the other: flood, drought, plague and famine. Despite the fact that man's original nature is good, as are the principle and the Way, mankind is also influenced by this climate (133) and rebellion breaks out. Heaven is not responsible for these events since heaven did not wish them, but neither can it intervene. In fact, heaven regards moral degradation and natural disasters in much the same way as a man would regard the worms teeming in his stomach, powerless to do anything about them. It may thus happen that lightning strikes an innocent peasant while sparing a bandit (134). This basic pessimism with regard to man and the universe ? which shows itself in distrust for the people, who are compared to sand (135) and regarded as easy prey for rebels and bandits (136) ? is counterbalanced by faith in the beneficial role of sages. The latter are able to achieve what heaven itself cannot. They can restore social order by virtue of the political skill and protect the people from natural disasters through their technical knowledge. In the passage from Liu Ji's Yulizi cited above, the description of reality reaches an unusually tragic level: the world is like a jungle where the wicked dominate the good and the strong bully the weak. Although rare, this type of description has (131) The phrase was literally the 'thief of the universe'. Cf. Jiang Guozhu, op. cit., pp. 71-72. (132) Cf.

(136) Cf. Liu Ji, Yulizi, 3a. [31] 407</page><page sequence="32">precedents in the Lip itself, where the overturning of values is depicted in a world ruled by disorder. However, what is relevant in Yulizi is not the juxtaposition of order and disorder but the question of how to square the theory of celestial order with the reality of the world. From a reading of the text, one would expect howls of despair at the predominance of evil, the type of anguished reaction so common in the West. In Europe, inspiration has been drawn from the power of evil by religious thinkers, philosophers and writers alike, from Kierkegaard to Bernanos and Dostoevskij. In Liu Ji, however, we find none of this anguish, but rather a disciple's challenge to his master, an intellectual game, albeit as part of a debate seeking to solve a theoretical question left open by Zhu Xi. First of all, Liu Ji reasserts the theory of heaven's dual attitude towards man. Heaven's intentions are good and it is moral by virtue of its mind or will, which is the universal principle and which contains goodness. However, it neither intervenes nor acts directly in personal or political affairs. Echoing a long tradition, Liu affirms that 'those who practise good are not always fortunate, while those whose conduct is unbecoming are not necessarily unfortunate' (137). It is therefore evident that 'heaven is not able to assign good and bad fortune to men', and 'when bad energy prevails over principle, evil manifests itself. Liu Ji returns to the distinction between the sphere of ethics and that of destiny: the former depends on man, the latter does not. 'Good and evil depend upon man, but good and bad fortune depend upon chance. When abnormal energy prevails, man cannot resist his destiny' (138). However, Liu Ji does not completely rule out all types of retribution in that 'the mind of heaven loves good and hates evil' and 'correct energy rewards good with fortune and punishes evil with misfortune'. He then takes up the customary argument of the retributive standpoint, according to which if a person is not punished for his misconduct during his lifetime, his descendants will have to pay for it. Liu Ji regards this as due not to karma but simply to the fact that human life is short. At the basis of all this lies a process consisting in the natural and automatic interaction of the positive and negative forces of energy. For that matter, it is the original energy [yuanqi), always positive and correct, that is active, in continuous movement, and it is this energy that is restored (fu) sooner or later. The return of positive original energy operates also in human life and produces its effects in the sphere of the existence of a perverse man, as in the case of the inglorious end of the 'usurper' Wang Mang, or in the following generations, as in the case of the dethroning of the descendants of Cao Cao. Retribution thus takes place when energy is correct, and this comes about in heaven's name. Instead, when it is bad or abnormal energy {xieqi) that operates, the good man may be struck by calamity. This may be rectified during the lifetime of a wicked man, but also after (137) Cf. Liu Ji, Yulizi shenxian, Tiansbuo, 1, Cbengyibo wenji, 4, in Zhongguo zhexuesbi ziliao xuanji, Song Yuan Ming zhi bu, p. 411. (138) Ibid., p. 412. 408 [32]</page><page sequence="33">his death. This would explain why such persons sometimes enjoy prosperity and happiness during their lives (139). When bad energy prevails over the principle, heaven is not responsible for the consequences. In such conditions of disorder only the sages can restore the situation or prepare for a new era of harmony. They are compared to 'good doctors' and it is in them that the importance of the human role in cosmic 'salvation' manifests itself. This is what Liu Ji means by his assertion that 'there is something that heaven cannot do and that only man can do' (140). As remarked above, these conditions of disorder can explain why the righteous may suffer and the wicked escape their just punishment. The problems arising from the life and sufferings of Job and from the function of suffering are completely extraneous to Liu Ji's vision of things. However, two questions still remain somewhat obscure: the role of the restoration of original energy {fu) and human responsibility. What does appear certain is heaven's lack of responsibility for moral wrong and for the sufferings of the righteous. Heaven represents the ethical order for Liu Ji too. Conversely, good and bad fortune depend on the combination of the two energies, positive and negative, and their impact on the various living beings. On the one hand, this is a random process, with positive energy prevailing on some occasions and negative energy on others. On the other hand, however, Liu resorts to the deus ex machina of yuanqi and fu. But if fu consists merely in the reversal of the previous tendency of energy, why should particular consideration be given to just one of the possible combinations, i.e. the 'final' rectification and the punishment of evil? A certain contradiction would appear to remain between the clearsighted, realistic representation of reality and its 'amoral' nature on the one hand, and the 'stickiness' of moralistic, retributive tendencies on the other. This tradition also seems to get the better of the rationalism, despite the latter's strength. With regard to human responsibility, the question arises as to whether the mechanical interaction between positive and negative energy in their impact on man might influence not only the latter's existence but also his moral qualities and choices (see the Scholastic debate and before, the famous debate between Platonists and Stoics concerning the aporia Fate/responsibility). This would lead to ethical determinism, and it is hard to see why man should be punished or rewarded for acts that he materially performs but the 'responsibility' for which belongs to other forces. Neither would it then be possible to assert, as Liu Ji in fact does, that good and evil depend on man. The emphasis on the crucial role of karma and hence the absence of 'free will' already pointed out in Confucian anti-Buddhist polemics still represented no negligible stumbling block and could lead to fatalistic amoralism. Retribution would thus remain as a purely external mechanism automatically and objectively registering the quality (139) Ibid., p. 411-14. (140) Ibid., p. 414. [33] 409</page><page sequence="34">of actions regardless of the spirit in which they were performed. Otherwise, it would have no more sense and should be rejected. This would bear out the words spoken by the protagonist of a 17th century novel, 'The Romantic Adventures of Emperor Yang of the Sui' (Sui Yangdi yanshi), in conversation with the last sovereign of the Chen dynasty, who had visited him in a dream: 'Wealth and honour are questions of fortune, both won and lost by chance' (141). Similar views are expressed by Wang Wei (1324-1374), a scholar and contemporary of Liu Ji. While recognizing no correspondence in this world between moral good and happiness, he accepts a restricted concept of retribution. According to Wang Wei, the Heavenly Way rewards the righteous with good fortune and punishes the wicked with misfortune (fushan huoyin tian zhi Dao ye). However, this retribution is limited neither to present conduct nor to present existence but extends to the 'virtue' [de) of the clan or family, i.e. to the 'patrimony' created by one's forebears and composed of accumulated merits and demerits (jishan, pe): Auspicious and inauspicious events are the result of good and evil, as the shadow and the echo are the resonance of shapes and sounds. The accumulation of merits is like the day that lengthens imperceptibly without man realizing it, while the accumulation of demerits is like a flame that consumes oil, even though the individual may not be aware of it. The sage can ascertain a man's level of goodness or wickedness by observing his fortunes or misfortunes. There exists no good deed that remains concealed and does not appear, neither is there a bad action, however small, that escapes notice. The Way of Heaven repays goodness with fortune and immorality with misfortune. In the 'Classic of Changes' it is written: 'The family that accumulates merits always has an abundance of happiness, while the family that accumulates demerits always has an abundance of misfortune'. In the world there are also those who, despite their good works, undergo a series of calamities, while others who have behaved badly lead fortunate lives. An ancient adage states that if a wicked man prospers, it is because his ancestors have accumulated a surplus of merits, and if an honest person is ruined, it is because his ancestors have accumulated a surplus of demerits. (142) Furthermore, referring to the Taoist concept of 'resonance' or ganying (143), Wang Wei asserts the principle of interaction between heaven and earth and accepts the (141) Cf. Sui Yangdi yanshi, 12: 131. Cf. R. Hegel, The Novel in Seventeenth-Century China, New York 1981, p. 109. (142) Cf. Wang Wei, Zhici, 12a-b. The quotation from Yijing, which is mentioned by almost all scholars who tackle the subject, is taken from the hexagram kun. Cf. J. Legge's transl., The I Ching..., op. cit., p. 419. This type of rationalization recalls the views of Hu Anguo (1074-1138), who is also responsible for some interpolations on the retributive doctrine: 'heaven rewards good and punishes evil over the long term; this is a statistical process and does not hold for individual persons and events' (Needham, op. cit., II, p. 388). (143) Cf. Le Blanc, op. cit. 410 [34]</page><page sequence="35">retributive idea with no reservations: Relations between heaven and man are very close. Human affairs influence the world and celestial phenomena reverberate in heaven. When energy is harmonious it brings good fortune, but when it is in disorder it brings calamity. If it is benign it is auspicious and ushers in the five fortunes (longevity, wealth, health, love of virtue and natural death); when malign it is ill-omened and ushers in the six extreme [misfortunes] (a short life, illness, pain, poverty, vice and weakness [...]. (144) Conversely, the indifference of the universe was emphasized by Wang Tingxiang (1474-1544), a strenuous advocate of rationalistic principles: The birth of the beings in the universe is due to the necessity of circumstances (shi bu de bu ran). Where is the mind of heaven? The strong devour the weak, the great exploit the lowly, the cunning oppress the simple. The condition of beings cannot be otherwise. Where is the mind of heaven? The vulgar Confucians claim that the universe produces beings and things for man's benefit. Alas, what error! (145) In fact, Wang Tingxiang denied that the universe was in any way rational or providential and poured ridicule on the views of those who sought instead to discover a reason or purpose for each phenomenon. The five cereals appear to be made for man, but what about the poisonous weeds? Farm animals also seem to exist for man's benefit, but what of the insects and dangerous reptiles? And if food was created specifically in order to feed man, we must conclude that man was created in order to satisfy the wild beasts. Besides Wang Tingxiang, Lii Kun (1536-1618) also strenuously denied heaven's possession of a specific will as asserted by earlier thinkers. While he distinguishes in ontological terms between two types of heaven ? one corresponding to morality, the other to the life and destiny of each individual ? both of these are then traced back to the original energy (yuanqi) that constitutes the essence of the universe. Heaven thus corresponds to nature, with no providential or retributive attributes, with neither understanding nor will nor purposes of its own. In the final analysis, destiny therefore depends on the 'spontaneity' (ziran) with which yin and yang combine, and no purpose is served by religious rites and sacrifices. Only those who have attained the superior level of 'sincerity' are able to take possession of the secrets of the universe (146). Similar conclusions were reached with regard to the 'spontaneous genesis' [ziehen^ of all phenomena and to heaven's 'indifference' to man's conduct and fortunes by Xiong Bolong (1617?-1669), who anticipated some of Wang (144) Wang Wei, Zbki, 3b-4a.

[35] 411</page><page sequence="36">Fuzhi's remarks about the interpretation of the real as the alternation of the manifestation and latency of cosmic energy (147). Another facet of these discordant views appears in the collection of tales entitled 'Illusions' (Huanyin), in which the author ridicules belief in retribution and the calculation of merits and demerits, and stresses the effectiveness of the individual's own efforts (148). A rationalistic viewpoint is also expressed in the philosophical part of the 'Idle Discourses of the Soya Hut' (Doupeng xianhud) in its criticism of Buddhism and of popular belief and superstition. The theory of retribution passing from one life to another is here firmly rejected since, in the author's view, it could be used as justification by bandits and criminals (149). Some centuries later, new contributions were made to the discussion of the relationships between the universe, destiny and morality by Wang Fuzhi (1619-1692), a thinker of the vitalistic school. Under the influence of the cosmologists ? Zhou Dunyi (1017-1073) above all ? he put forward a creative interpretation of the Yijing combining ethical and naturalistic elements. Destiny was not to be regarded as a decree passed once and for all at the moment of birth, but as something produced and completed day by day. This harmonized with the conception of the cosmos, which produced and reproduced continuously, with no interruption (150). In this eternal dynamic process of the universe, the condensation of energy brought about the birth of beings, while its dispersal led to their death. Each movement was therefore the spontaneous condition of the principle. The sage was aware of this and therefore accepted life and death with serenity (m). Therefore, according to Wang Fuzhi, only the sages are able to know destiny by discerning its tendencies from the imperceptible initial movements (ji). In this way, they develop their capacities and their influence on the natural order (152). As McMorran acutely observes, in his insistence on the need for agreement with the real conditions and processes of the universe (shi), Wang continues a tradition whose cultural antecedents may be traced back to the Taoists and the realists of the pre-Qin era. However, mysterious as the operations of the conditions and of the Way may be, Wang advocates no passive and fatalistic acceptance of universal change. Change is inevitable, but within change it is necessary to make the corrections which enable man to obtain a certain control over the circumstances he is faced with (147) Cf. Xiong Bolong, Wuhe ji, 4Introduction', pp. 1, 5, cit. in Jiang Guozhu, op. cit., pp. 78-80. (148) Cf. P. Hanan, The Fiction of Moral Duty: The Vernacular Story in 1640s', in R. Hegel &amp; R.

Harley Black, Man and Nature in the Philosophical Thought of Wang Fu-chih, Seattle-London 1989, pp. 223-35. 412 [36]</page><page sequence="37">by taking account of the forces in play and acting accordingly. While the conditions undergo continuous change in step with the constant evolution of the universe, the manner in which they change is neither predetermined nor absolutely inevitable. Man must do everything in his power to influence them. The ideal is to be the master of time. Second best is to anticipate time, and third best to adapt oneself to it. The worst thing is to oppose time: this is fatal. When one is master of time, the whims of circumstance fluctuate in harmony with him, since he controls and regulates time. When one anticipates time, the basic principle ? when he foresees what is about to happen ? consists in guiding and controlling its realization. When one is in agreement with time, one conforms to what time makes inevitable in such a way as to save himself and to avoid all disaster. (153) Both the imperceptible initial movement or impulse (ji) and the real conditions (shi) are determined by the factors of time and space, and it is here that man can intervene to modify circumstances and history. This is in fact what distinguishes man from the other animals: his ability to 'defeat heaven' (shengtian) or even 'mould' it (zaotian) (154). Because of this non-fatalistic attitude, divination and consultation of the 'Classic of Changes' were regarded as highly effective. Through the study of the combination of the various hexagrams it was possible to understand each particular situation 'historically', setting it within the context of broader tendencies, without sticking to preconceived ideas or preferences, but adapting to it in such a way as to contribute to its evolution. Study of this text was the way to learn the doctrine of the sages, and divination was the art of learning what was just and opportune rather than of predicting the future. In fact, Wang Fuzhi saw this Classical above all as a treatise of moral reflection. At the same time, however, it was also a tool enabling one to anticipate the course and trend of events, to face dangers and forestall error in both the practical and ethical fields. Its consultation made it possible to 'know destiny' (zhi ming) and to 'establish one's own destiny' (// ming) The sage's behaviour was correct in that it was guided solely by his inner determination rather than by hope of reward or fear of punishment. According to Wang Fuzhi, 'a worthy man is not driven to act virtuously by any thought of recompense' (156). By doing so, however, he was able to take successful decisions. Wang Fuzhi's contemporary Gu Yanwu (1613-1682) also criticized those scholars who accepted Buddhism and Taoism on the grounds that 'although their conduct differs (153) Cf. Chunqiu shilun in Chuanshan yishu, 5: 7b, and I. McMorran, 'Wang Fu-chih and the Neo Confucian Tradition', in Th. De Bary, ed., The UnfoldingofNeo-Confucianism, New York 1975, pp. 456-57. (154) Cf.

[37] 413</page><page sequence="38">from those who are absorbed with buying lands and building houses, in actual fact they are similar because they are driven by selfish interest' (157). To conclude, we have reviewed a kaleidoscopic series of different attitudes, all of which agree, however, in denying any direct relationship between human conduct and destiny. Some scholars saw this as due to the amorality of destiny. Most of the more profound moralists, on the other hand, still regarded heaven as fundamentally good, as the source of morality, but refused to acknowledge any automatic intervention in human affairs. Self-perfection was therefore to be pursued for its own sake, and if good deeds were performed with the aim of obtaining some advantage thereby, they would lose their moral character. These different conclusions are reminiscent of the various answers put forward by Greek and Hellenistic thinkers to the problem of the relation between the divinity and evil, monistic solutions in particular favouring the idea of an ambivalent god, both good and bad, or an amoral god, or above all the concept of a fundamentally good universal order into which evil ? understood as imperfection ? was integrated as an essential part of the overall plan. The Chinese views based on the dualities of yin and yang or principle-energy are instead far removed from Greek ideas of the dualistic type, such as that which saw the freedom of divine goodness as limited by the presence of unruly and negative matter (158). 7. Different Attitudes The good you wish others to see is no true good; The evil you fear others knowing is great evil. (159) Of the various types of approach to emerge from our examination of some concepts of destiny, some are more in line with Confucian principles and others quite removed. We have considered the purely retributive viewpoint, which treats destiny as an impartial and zealous judge of morality. While this may be regarded as serving Confucian ethics by enhancing their effectiveness, it runs counter to their basic attitude of rationalism and scepticism and even creates the premises for a utilitarian interpretation. Then there is the intermediate sort of 'rational-retributive' view, which stands halfway between the previous idea and 'realism', tempering the over-simplicity of the former with a series of theoretical adjustments. This is followed by the 'realistic' or 'sceptical' view, which seeks to examine reality without belief or prejudice and denies (157) Cf. Gu Yanwu, Rizhilu jishi, 13: 328. (158) Cf. RJ. Burton, The Devil. Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity, Ithaca London 1987, pp. 168-73. (159) Cf. Zhu Bolu, Zhijia geyan, cit. in Zhongguo gudai mingju cidian, Shanghai 1986, p. 531. 414 [38]</page><page sequence="39">the possibility of any super-human justice. Then there are schools which tend to accentuate the fatalistic aspects, while others attribute human will with varying scope for intervention. These are nothing more than general tendencies, manifested in practical terms through a series of intermediate opinions. In order to complete the framework of the various viewpoints, especially in the popular field, it will be worthwhile to examine the interpretations than emerge in the field of literature. As mentioned above, although the concept of baoying is often associated with the Buddhist concept of karma, it was in fact also adopted by popular Taoism and was so widespread that even Confucian texts reported numerous examples of retribution in the life of the individual or over the generations. This approach proved to be more in keeping with and comprehensible to the popular mentality, at least until halfway through the Ming era, when the enormous social and political changes were also to influence the different levels of mentality and new syncretistic tendencies were established among the various layers of society (160). It should also be borne in mind that, while scholars accepted the rationalist principle of the independence of natural phenomena and personal destiny from human conduct, we have no way of knowing whether they also rejected these 'superstitions' in private. This tendency is illustrated by the following proverb: 'although these are all superstitions, it is impossible not to believe them' [mixin mixin budebu xin). What are we to make of the practice of consulting the 'Classic of Changes' (Yijing) and of its interpretation? As one example from the host of possibilities, let us take the mathematician and philologist Jiao Xun (1763-1820), who devoted many of his studies to the interpretation of this Confucian classic in an attempt to explain, by means of his scientific knowledge, how the text could be used in order to understand the conduct necessary to prolong happiness and avoid misfortune. Divination, astronomy, numerology and fortune-telling (yin yang, xiangshu, tian guan, wang qi) (161) were widely known and practised among scholars, whose attitude was often also ambiguous with regard to alchemy and Taoist techniques for longevity and immortality (162). Spiritual crises were often brought about by the advent of serious (160) Cf. Wu Pei-yi, 'Self-Examination and Confession of Sins in Traditional China', HJAS, 1979, 39, 1, pp. 5-38. (161) Cf. Fang Yizhi's autobiographical work, Qi jie, where, among other things, he writes: T learnt through the yin and yang, images and numbers, the signs of the stars, and the observation of the atmosphere for portents', transl. W. Peterson, Bitter Gourd, Fang l-chih and the Impetus for Intellectual Change, New Haven-London 1979, p. 18. (162) The use of 'immortality' pills was not confined to emperors, though the latter certainly indulged to a great extent. For the Ming period, see Liu Ts'un-yan, 'Taoist Self-cultivation in Ming thought', in Th. De Bary, ed., Self and Society in Ming Thought, New York-London 1970, pp. 291-330; A. Seidel, 'A Taoist Immortal of the Ming Dynasty: Chang San-feng', ibid., pp. 483-531; Liu Ts'un-yan, 'The Penetration of Taoism into the Ming Neo-Confucian Elite', TP, 57, 1971, pp. 31-102. Cf. also Peterson, op. cit., pp. 133-39. [39] 415</page><page sequence="40">misfortunes which, regarded as heavenly warnings and signs of retribution, stimulated greater involvement in one's moral life and more active pursuit of the Way through Neo-Confucian self-cultivation (163). Another widespread and widely known type of work are the prophetic books (yuyan), which were often banned on the grounds of the explosive political implications to be derived form their reading. They in fact contained a periodical breakdown of past and future history leading towards a 'New Beginning' and thus lent themselves to use as subversive political propaganda, especially by secret societies. The 'Song of the Pancakes' (Shaobing ge) by Liu Ji (1311-1375) is one of the most famous of the so-called 'Prophetic books of the five thousand years' {Zhongguo wuqianntan zhi yuyan) (164). It must also be borne in mind that scholars and officials often attributed the misfortunes of members of opposing factions to their own mistakes as proof of their wickedness. For example, upon the death of the son of his adversary Li Gong, the scholar and official Fang Bao (1668-1749), known as the founder of the Tongcheng school and strenuous defender of the 'Song studies', wrote the former a despicable letter blaming him for the sad event sent by heaven as punishment for his attacks upon Zhu Xi (165). Others went so far as to challenge the emperor's authority by blaming a series of natural disasters upon his political choices. In 1632, Huang Shaojie attributed the drought affecting various parts of the empire along with other calamities and revolts to the appointment of Wen Tiren ? a well known adversary of the Donglin party ? as Grand Secretary. The wishes of heaven could only be satisfied by Wen's destitution (166). If such was the influence of the idea of retribution among the educated classes, it is hardly surprising that literature was full of similar elements. The plots of stories are often marked by the workings of the retributive principle. In the preface to the collection entitled 'Common Words to Warn the World' (Jingshi tongyan), Feng Menglong compares the short story to Buddhist preaching of the principle of karma (163) In their diaries, scholars of the 16th and 17th century often regard their ill luck as destiny's punishment for previous conduct. See for example the remarks of Zhang L?xiang and Wang Ji cited in Wu Pei-yi, op. cit., pp. 217-22. Then again, in his preface to Tao'an mengyi (Taibei 1978, 'Preface', p. 1) Zhang Dai (1597-1684?) explains the collection of memoirs as the fruit of sincere repentance, though this may seem a skilful literary device. In the preface he echoes the law of an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth in comparing the misfortunes and hardships of today with the pomp and excesses of the past. (164) &lt;jju Q\tft -m L.C.

And yet, in some of his works the same Feng Menglong gives an ironic exposition of the popular view of destiny, e.g. blaming one's misfortunes on heaven and on men, or fatalistically attributing everything to the good or bad karma of previous existences. In the author's view, the principal cause of one's failures was instead to be attributed to underestimating one's limitations or an inadequate understanding of the real situation (168). In the 'Sequel to the Journey to the West' (Hou xiyou ji), a story of the 17th century, the idea of predestination is bitterly criticized during a debate between the Monkey and the judges of the underworld (169). Equally critical is the comment on the first edition {sixuecaotang, 1695) of the 'Novel of the Sui and the Tang' {Sui Tang yanyi), a work that does not fail to attribute the downfall of the Sui and the Tang to the excessive passions of the Emperor Yang and to the blindness of An Lushan: Now as to the later retribution for primary and secondary causation, it has never been ascertained that such events do in fact occur. Instead, it is a means to deceive people. When [the author] narrates himself into a corner he says that this was karma unresolved from a previous life. Or he may say that this was retribution for some evil act from a previous life. The Buddha has said that you can learn about the causations in your previous life from what you receive in the present life, that you can learn about the causations for your next life from what you do in the present life. Yet all such statements are intended to encourage people to do good; they are (167) Cit. in Zheng Zhenduo, Zhongguo wenxuo yanjiu, Beijing 1957, p. 400: cf. A. Levy, Le conte en langue vulgaire du XVII siecle, Paris 1981, p. 304. For the role played by retribution in fiction, see W.L. Idema, Chinese Vernacular Fiction: The Formative Period, Leiden 1974, pp. XXXI-XXXII. See also the emphasis on the concept of 'accumulating merits' (jide) in many stories, as in the 'Novel of the Three Doctrines' (Sanjiao kaimi guizheng yanyi), studied by J.A. Berling, 'Religion and Popular Culture: The Management of Moral Capital in the Romance of the Three Teachings', in Johnson, Nathan &amp; Rawski, eds., Popular Culture in Late Imperial China, Berkeley-Los Angeles-London 1985, pp. 188-218. See also the exposition of the concept of retribution at the beginning of the story 'Li Yuan saves the red serpent' (Li Yuan Wujiang jiu zhushe), which forms part of the collection of Hong Pian, Qingpingshan tang huahen (Beijing 1955, 27: 517); the customary advice to 'accumulate merits' is justified by the fact that since riches may be squandered and culture cannot always be passed on to one's offspring, the only inheritance that will never be lost is that of good deeds. Similar ideas are also expressed in the eleventh story of the same collection, 'A secret virtue accumulates merits' (Yinzhi jishan), 11: 193-201. (168) Cf. P. Hanan, The Chinese Vernacular Story, Cambridge-London 1981, p. 100. Hanan quotes the following ironic comment by Feng Menglong on fatalistic attitudes: 'Take two students. One has high talent and exceptional scholarship yet leads a life of failure, never finding anyone who appreciates him and ending his days in obscurity. The other, at a tender age, when he can barely mumble a few lines, let alone write decent prose, passes all the examinations at his first attempt, and is applauded and lionized. The man who fails says the examiners are blind and the heavens deaf; little does he realize that the youth may have studied and done good deeds in some previous existence, thus accumulating the early success and distinction he enjoys in his life'. The sixth tale of the collection Shi dian tou also warns against judging by present or apparent conditions. (Cf. Shi dian tou, Taibei 1969, pp. 91-104). (169) Cf. Hou xiyou ji, Beijing 1989, pp. 27-32. [41] 417</page><page sequence="42">not in fact based on anything verifiable. I say that whatever your past life was, your present life will be just the same. The Classic of Changes states &lt; The family that accumulates goodness is sure to have superabundant happiness, and the family that accumulates evil is sure to have superabundant misery &gt; . Such words as these, now are reasonable. By the time the Sui and the Tang appeared filth and debauchery in the inner chambers knew no bounds; who knows whence propriety, righteousness, trustworthiness, and a sense of shame had been cast aside ? [people] even went so far as to commit homicide and to do violence. [The author] rationalizes the situation by saying that so and so is precisely such and such from a previous life. He asserts that karma from before had not yet been resolved and that all and that all rules and regulations had been relegated to the dust; this is why such pungent matters obtained. He speaks of devils and of the gods in order to awaken the people of this world from their improper acts that they might not produce heretical thoughts. (17?) In the Xihu erjiy The Second Collection of the Western Lake', it is expressly stated that Buddhist retribution completes the Confucian doctrine (171). The first story quotes a passage from the 'Collection on Retribution' {Baojing lu), a classic of retributive ideology, which lists a whole series of analogies between the circumstances accompanying the downfall of the reign of the Later Zhou and that of their successors the Song. The author comments: If we start from this viewpoint, even the years and the months correspond perfectly, and we can understand that is was a case of retribution and that the Way of heaven cannont be challenged. Insofar as the Song emperor Taizu did his utmost for the well-being of the people, was magnanimous in government, made humanity his virtue and re-ordered the norms for the clans, his dynasty was able to maintain power for generations and governed the empire for over three hundred years. And yet this example of retribution is not unlike the system governing everyday life, in which there is never a debt that does not have to be paid. But the Baojing lu illustrates only cases of [evident] retribution and does not explain those of hidden retribution. To see this, read the following story, 'The king of Wu Yue wins back his lands'. In fact, it is written that 'every injustice is vindicated by another injustice, every evil is linked to another evil. If you borrow a silver tael, you repay it with a thousand coins (that is, a hundred times as much) (172). How can even the most secret of plots escape their just punishment? [...]'. (173) (170) Cf.

The two aspects are taken into consideration: that of destiny, which does not depend on a person's will, and the subjective aspect tied up with responsibility and individual conduct. About one and a half centuries later, despite his non-conformist attitude, the writer Li Ruzhen was to reaffirm the principles of retribution. In his view, good conduct produced a sort of invisible protection against calamity during one's life and ensured recompense after death. He described this condition as a shining halo, lingguang, that kept ghosts and wild beasts at bay and that could only be dimmed by bad conduct. However, he did admit that retribution could not always take place during this life (175). One of Li Yu's tales relates the following edifying episode in a context resembling that of a detective story: Not long ago, there was a butcher who lived next to a Buddhist house of meditation. One night it was burned to the ground, while the slaughter-house remained intact. Not understanding why Heaven would allow this to happen, many people murmured that Heaven was blind and that it rewarded people on earth without rhyme or reason. But when they went to the slaughter-house, they saw a note on the door: T have been a butcher for half my life, and deeply rooted in sin. Today, I swear that I shall never slaughter animals again. If I break this oath, let the Heavens exterminate me forever'. The people did a little figuring and found that the butcher had posted this note three days before the fire. They were taken completely by surprise, wondering aloud why the butcher seemed to be more favored by the Heavens than was the Buddhist devotee. The butcher, who happened to be there, offered the following explanation: The Buddhist devotee is one in name only. ? he said ? Recently he discovered a way to counterfeit money. That's probably why his house was burned down'. (176) Another interesting aspect of the story of the fire in the house of meditation lies in the surprising similarities with the stories of miracles said to have happened to Chinese (m) Cf.

Retribution is a recurrent theme in this collection. A particularly striking story is that of a youth who is castrated and forced to act as a mistress but finally takes revenge for his sufferings. The poem written by tire eunuch when the criminal is punished ends with the customary retributive moral: Never be scheming and foully sly, For every evil deed brings its own retribution. (Ibid., p. 62). [43] 419</page><page sequence="44">converts to Christianity. The theme of fire appears to be a commonplace in the traditional literature of edification (177). Besides the 'moral books', the tales of spoken language constitute the greatest wealth of material offering an insight into the workings of the retributive system. Despite the authoritative reservations expressed as to functionality and seriousness of references to retribution and to karma in literature (178), the theme was unquestionably a popular one with readers of the time. At times the titles themselves convey this idea and are indicative of the interest aroused by the subject (179). As pointed out above, the plot often follows the logic of 'cause and effect', which in many cases constitutes the main bond of continuity between characters and events. At times the hero personifies the pure man struggling against injustice and disorder, or the champion striving his utmost for the poor and the oppressed, a figure with whom it was easy for the common people to identify. The protagonist may also be a loyal official, a general or even a rebel. He thus becomes the tool of retribution in that he restores peace and order, regardless of whether the story in question is historical, chivalrous, romantic or erotic. As a rule, therefore, the villain suffers the consequences of his conduct before the end of the story. As it is written in the 'Novel of the Sui and the Tang' (Sui Tang yanyi): 'When evil has reached its peak, it will e punished. It is a question of time' (180). As depicted in the stories of Feng Menglong, the mechanism of retribution is more profound than in popular morality, where transgression often involved consequences that took no account of intentions or mitigating circumstances. The former's tales demonstrate an advanced process of interiorization and the increased importance of the sentiments (181). Many other examples are provided by literature and the theatre. In the stories of Ling Mengchu (1580-1644), human conduct and events are linked by a higher design of justice identified with the celestial principle of Neo-Confucianism. Though immanent, this meta-human force acts as the linchpin (177) See the cases reported by Gernet {China and Christian Impact..., op. cit., pp. 99-101), such as the story of the house threatened by fire but spared thanks to the prayers of a Christian, which even change the direction of the wind so as to burn down the house of an apostate. In other cases, similar miracles save the dwellings of Christians from the flames. (178) For example, J. Prusek (The Narrators of Buddhist Scriptures and Religious Tales in the Sung Period', ArOr, 10, 1938, p. 386) criticizes their 'facile moral explanation' and 'unreal schematism'. (179) Cf. for example the collections of 18 or 24 stories entitled Tanhuan hao, 'Retribution for the lecherous'. A broad study of the relationship between destiny and retribution in stories with romantic plots is provided by the recent doctorate thesis by Yenna Wu, Marriage Destinies to Awaken the World: A Literary Study of Xingshi yinyuan zhuan, Ph.D. Dissertation, Harvard 1986, in particular pp. 87-96. (180) Cf. Sui Tang yanyi, 68: 534. Assurances as to the inevitability of celestial reward or punishment are common throughout the literature. (181) Cf. A. Levy, op. cit., p. 310. See also the value attributed to intentions in the Shanshu and the passage cited at the beginning of this section. 420 [44]</page><page sequence="45">of the various episodes and provides the conclusion, making possible the discovery of injustice and the punishment of crime (182). Its role is so evident that many stories are dominated by a strong sense of predestination that seems at times to pass over into quietism. This is exemplified in the words of Zhuangzi, yiyin yizhuo: 'it is impossible to obtain what is denied by destiny, no matter how one strives'. As Patrick Hanan observes, Ling Mengchu appears to be seeking to discourage any hope or ambition in the sphere of desires ? whether for prosperity, marriage, offspring or social prestige ? because both success and failure depend on destiny (183). A certain degree of fatalism is also found in the current way of thinking. As it is written in the 'Stories of Love' {Qingshi): 'Destiny cannot be forced (184), nor can the excess or lack of feeling change a union or separation that is predestined' (185). A similar viewpoint underlies the crepuscular autobiographical novel of Shen Fu, 'Six Tales of a Fluctuating Life' (Fusheng liuji), where joy and sorrow are traced back to destiny. He writes that while the latter is not an omnipotent god, not even Buddha can change an unlucky fate, and advises in another passage against forcing destiny in the pursuit of joy (186). Elsewhere, however, the idea of retribution serves as a means to assert an active attitude towards life. The writings of Yuan Huang (1533-1606) document his conversion from a passive, fatalistic acceptance of destiny to an active idea of man's intervention in his own fortunes (187). Yuan Huang asserted the theory (182) Cf. Hanan, op. cit., p. 154. (183) Cf. P. Hanan, 'The Nature of Ling Meng-ch'u's Fiction', in Plaks, ed., Chinese Narrative. Critical and Theoretical Essays, Princeton 1977, pp. 99-100. (184) Cf. also the expression in Ling Mengchu: 'It is difficult to force success' {Pai'an jingqi, 40: 702). (185) Cf. Qingshi, Shenyang 1986, 2: 66. (186) Cf. Shen Fu, Fusheng liuji, Taibei 1986, 3: 52, 62. It is tempting to compare this cautious attitude with some western affirmations of an apparently different stamp ? e.g. the famous adage that 'fortune favours the bold' ? expressed by Italian humanists such as Leon Battista Alberti, Marsilio Ficino and Niccolo Machiavelli. However, as Delumeau points out, these apparently euphorical remarks often boil down to advice about seizing the opportunity or the right moment. Moreover, it is by now proven that the Renaissance demolished the belief in Providence imposed by Christianity in place of the Greek Tyke and the Roman Fortuna, but did not succeed in formulating an optimistic vision of history and destiny, clear evidence of which is provided by the disturbing tendency to harp on the blindness and inconstancy of fortune. (Cf. Delumeau, Le peche et la peur... op. cit.; Ital. transl., pp. 278-302). (187) A fortune teller had given Yuan Huang a series of negative predictions including little success in his examinations, a short life and the lack of offspring. In 1569, however, after passing his prefectorial and provincial examinations, Yuan was persuaded by a Chan monk to react in such a way as to modify his destiny through the system of 'merits and demerits'. He and his family thus began to accumulate merits at he was eventually convinced that his successes were due to his moral cultivation. He passed the jinshi examinations in 1585, had the child he despaired of, and lived to a ripe old age. (Cf. the biography of Yuan Huang in Goodrich &amp; Fang, op. cit., pp. 1632-35. For his view of destiny, see also Tadao Sakai, op. cit., pp. 343-44, and above all Brokaw, op. cit., pp. 152-91). [45] 421</page><page sequence="46">of establishing one's own destiny, liming, which combined the teaching of Wang Gen and Wang Ji with popular morality and Buddhist and Taoist techniques. In the 'Romantic Tale of the Emperor Yang of the Sui', (Sui Yangdiyanshi), despite the ideological commitment to the concept of retribution, the responsibility for the downfall of the Sui is shifted in a poem from human faults to the independent will of heaven: When luck leaves, the signs appear from every side. When sorrow comes, there's little use in being grieved; All events are heaven's will for foul and fair ? Far beyond the strengths of mortal man! (188) A more complex and to some extent contradictory viewpoint appears to be adopted by Yuan Yuling (1599-1674), whose 'Anecdotes of the History of the Sui' (Suishi yiwen), while not questioning the pre-eminent role of celestial destiny ? upon which life and death, advantage and disadvantage, success and failure all depend (189) ? do not rule out the possibility of man playing an active leading role (190). After stating that 'life and death are in one's destiny', one of the characters in 'The Mirror and the Flowers' (Jinghuayuan) shows that his fatalism is not all that strong by embarking upon a difficult enterprise (191). In a discussion among girls, Shi Lanyan demonstrates the soundness of the retributive doctrine by quoting passages from the Classics against the objections raised by her companions, which appear to be based on the criticisms of Wang Chong (192). The concept of retribution thus has a twofold significance in speculative thought. Its acceptance implies an ethical perception of destiny, which impartially punishes crime and rewards virtue. In this case, the concept of destiny coincides with that of heaven, and punishes and rewards within the framework of retribution. However, the acceptance of such an idea also implies serious limitations upon man's moral freedom and responsibility. If my conduct is the consequence of my previous existence, how could I possibly act differently? What fault is it then of mine if I follow my karma? However, the problem does not appear to have caused misgivings either among thinkers, who took the existence of such responsibility for granted, or among writers, most of whom employed the scheme of retribution in the plots of their stories, solving the contradiction at the empirical level and confining themselves to displaying the automatic relation between conduct and its consequences. (188) Cf. R. Hegel, The Novel in Seventeenth-Century China, op. cit., p. 111. (189) Cf. Yuan Yulin, Suishi yiwen, Taibei 1977, 4: 24. (190) Cf. ibid., 59: 410.

Hsia, The Scholar-Novelist and Chinese Culture: A Study of Ching Hua Yuan', Tamkang Review, 5, 2, 1974, p. 20. 422 [46]</page><page sequence="47">The idea of retribution thus shows itself to be attractive to the average reader, despite a certain bending with regard to the Confucian tradition. Man has always wondered about the causes of disasters, of physical and psychic decline, of injustice and of suffering, and such questioning is especially magnified in times of crisis or great upheaval. One answer could be the idea of direct retribution as a moral explanation of such phenomena. Another answer, at times contradicting the first, could focus on the inevitability of rise and fall. In its various formulations, the idea of retribution was often combined with a cyclical conception, especially in popular literature. This harmonized with a fundamentally dynamic view of reality and history based on the evolution of cosmic energy. The fatalistic character of this conception could also vary according to the consequences drawn. In 'The Dream of the Red Chamber' (Hongloumeng), Cao Xueqin asserts that every social group must, like the individual, take into account this continuous changing of reality in such a way as to be prepared for the worst in times of prosperity and to make the inevitable periods of decline less bitter. This can also be of use in the preparatory stages of recovery. In the thirteenth chapter, Fengjie has a premonitory dream in which Qin Keqing takes leave of her before dying. Speaking of the destiny of the family, Qin warns her of the ups and downs of human affairs: 'When the moon is full, it wanes; when the jug is full, the water overflows. [...] Those who rise too far, fall as fast as they have risen. [...] One day, after reaching its peak, happiness will cause sorrow'. When asked by Fengjie about the possibility of making serenity last, Qin replies: '[...] After reaching its peak, adversity is followed by happiness. Since ancient times, glory and dishonour have alternated reciprocally. How is it possible for human power to maintain [glory] forever? But now, when it is still the time of glory, it is possible to prepare oneself for the following period of decay, and thus to maintain safety. [...] Even the greatest banquets break up at the end [...]' (193). Thus we often encounter a combination of retribution and a certain fatalism, which does not, however, rule out the possibility of a moralistic ending. In the words of the poem at the beginning of the second of the 'Tales Ancient and Modern': 'The affairs of the world go round like a wheel. Present fortune or misfortune are never certain. Look, sooner or later everyone receives his retribution. Why should the heavenly Way forget the righteous?' (194). From the 16th century on, China is known to have experienced enormous upheavals and crises that cannot be regarded as mere adaptation or cyclical changes. These were bound to have repercussions in the intellectual field. Recourse to the traditional idea of retribution and its use in both Buddhist and Confucian terms may also be regarded (193) Cf. Hongloumeng, Beijing 1972, 13: 143-44. (194) Cf. Gujin xiaoshuo, Beijing 1979, 2: 39. Cf. also for example the ending of the fifth story of the Huanxi yuanjia, which asserts the same views as to the inevitability of retribution (Shenyang 1989, 5: 107; 5: 20 in the Tanhuanbao edition of the van Gulik collection). [47] 423</page><page sequence="48">as a form of indoctrination aimed at the lower levels of society, an ideological objective admitted consciously or unconsciously by various authors. However, the stories in question were not written solely for the middle and lower classes (195), and even in these cases the moral the writer was seeking to instill had to be presented in new forms so as to respond to new needs and fears. This work of propaganda was probably carried out by circles influenced by the ideas of Wang Yangming. However, a significant proportion of readers was made up of intellectuals, officials and merchants, classes in which the situation was far more complex. It was among them that the new individualistic trends had gained most ground along with heterodox movements of Buddhist and Taoist origin with strong utilitarian tendencies. Various social norms were coming to be regarded as mere 'conventions' which individuals no longer felt obliged to respect. This led to the problem of how to re-establish social harmony. There were serious doubts among writers as to the possibility of restoring social order through a return to Confucianism, given the weakening of the sense of responsibility among the elite and in the new social groups. Even Confucian movements opposed to the innovations of Wang Yangming, such as the Donglin and Fushe schools, took care not to advocate a return to Song Neo-Confucianism. A 'new' order and 'new' values had been sought after precisely by the schools that followed Wang Yangming and by syncretist thinkers strongly marked by Buddhist and popular influences. Among the various and contradictory answers offered by the elite, we may also include the view of destiny examined above, which saw it as depending on the movement of energy in the universe but also as susceptible to the influence of human conduct. Contradictory schools of thought and concepts coexisted in this kaleidoscopic atmosphere: fatalistic rationalism, amoral fatalism, predestination, personal responsibility, magical retribution, political retribution, utilitarianism, hedonism, rigorism. All these aspects are well documented, despite the lack of cogent papers on the theoretical debate. On the whole, however, in the late Ming period the traditional belief in cosmic order coupled with an acceptance of a certain retributive justice not only held its own but was actually strengthened. The concept underwent a process of greater interiorization and abstraction whereby less weight was attributed to the role of particular spirits and divinities, and more to the active role played by man himself (196). All scholars agree that the new stress laid upon the impersonal and mechanical nature of the process ? be it Buddhist karma or the cosmic order of Confucians or Taoist ? was resolved (195) According to the calculations carried out by Mote on the basis of examination registers (F. Mote, 'China's Past in the Study of China Today ? Some Comments on the Recent Work of Richard Solomon', JAS, 32, 1972, pp. 107-20), about 10% of the population was educated in the classical literary language. However, besides the candidates ? who may or may not have passed the examinations ? other important layers of society were able to read at least the literature written in the vernacular, these included many women of wealthy family, merchants, numerous employees of local offices, military officers, Buddhist and Taoist clergy. (196) Cf. Tadao Sakai, op. cit., pp. 342-45. 424 [48]</page><page sequence="49">by attributing man with greater autonomous power in determining his destiny (197). The predominant attitude may be exemplified in the following equation: merit corresponds to happiness as demerit corresponds to unhappiness. Sacrifices to heaven or to the divinities are therefore practically superfluous. However, the automatic nature of the process is tempered by a greater moral interiorization of the retributive idea and by a more careful consideration of intentions. 8. Bao as Gratitude and Resentment, Recompense and Revenge Then I confessed all my past sins before Buddha. I wrote a petition, seeking first to pass the examination for the juren degree, and pledging to perform three thousand good deeds to repay the goodness of heaven and my ancestors if this petition were granted. Yuan Huang (198) In the context of retribution, particular attention is required by the term bao. The concept is broader than that of 'cause and effect' or 'action and reaction' (ganying, yinguo) as it may be used in very different senses (199). In the passage cited at the beginning of this section, the use of the term in the retributive sense may appear to contrast with the conclusions drawn above, which spoke of an immanent and impersonal order. Here instead the implication is practically that of a personal favour, of a 'pact' made by Yuan with heaven and his ancestors whereby the former undertakes to acquire a certain number of merits in return for a favour. The original meaning of 'recompense' and 'gratitude' may imply the existence of a sort of personal relationship between man and divinity. The character is, in fact, also found in the word bao*en, commonly used in the context of human relations to indicate a profound emotional reaction of positive nature, such as appreciation, liking or empathy (200). However, when bao is used in the sense of 'retribution', a distinction should be drawn ? as far as this is possible in concrete cases ? between the philosophical conception of the abstract and immanent 'manifestation of the Way' and the popular beliefs in intercession on the part of this (197) Cf. Y? Ch?n-fang, The Renewal of Buddhism in China: Chu-hung and the Late Ming Synthesis, New York 1981; J. Handlin, Action in Late Ming Thought, Berkeley-Los Angeles-London 1983; Brokaw, op. cit. (198) Cf. Yuan Huang, Liming pian, p. 5a, quoted in Brokaw, op. cit., p. 166. (199) For the concept of hao, cf. Yang Lien-sheng (Yang Liansheng), The Concept of Pao as a Basis for Social Relations in China', in Fairbank, ed., Chinese Thought and Institutions, Chicago 1957, pp. 291-309; Yang Liansheng, Zhongguo wenhua zhong 'bad', 'bad', 'ba?' zhi yiyi, Hong Kong 1987. (200) Empathy being understood as a deep emotional resonance between two people (cf. C.E. Gauss, 'Empathy', in Wiener, ed., Dictionary of the History of Ideas. Studies of Selected Pivotal Ideas, New York 1973, p. 85). [49] 425</page><page sequence="50">or that spirit. Though the examples of retribution [of destiny] and those of gratitude and personal resentment are often intermingled and interconnected, from the theoretical standpoint it would be best to give separate consideration to the relationship between man and the cosmic order, in which ? with or without the intermediation of spirits, Buddha or divinities ? the former receives what is due to him on the basis of his past, present or future conduct. The monk Zhuhong advised all those who cultivated a wish to make a vow to perform a certain number of good deeds rather than pray or offer sacrifices (201). In such cases, the fundamental element is the quantity ? the algebraic sum of the positive and negative values of an individual's actions with respect to the universal order ? and it is of secondary importance whether or not spirits are asked to intercede. A very different situation obtains, however, with regard to revenge or recompense on the part of another man or the spirit of a dead person, in which case the key factors are the sentimental reaction, emotional state, and also the determination of the will in pursuing a certain equilibrium that one of the two parties has disturbed. Sophisticated use is made of the term bao in some stories by Feng Menglong, where it is applied both to celestial retribution and to every other type of 'corre? spondence' of the sentiments (202). The plot of some of these stories hinges upon the rewarding of a good action or the punishment of a crime (203), upon deep gratitude or indelible resentment, or upon some other resonance of sentiment (204). At the end of the first of the Tales Ancient and Modern' (Gujin xiaoshuo), for example, we find the following emblematic affirmation: 'being aware of the affection [received], repay it with affection', zhten bao'en, which expresses the reason for which a wife, though repudiated, saves her former husband (205). The same concept is expressed at the end of another story in the same collection by reference to the principle that 'affection is recompensed by affection' just as the 'melon is recompensed by jade' (206). In 'The Revenge of the Foxes', the sixth story of the 'Constant Words to Waken the World' (Xingshi hengyan), stress is laid upon the basic instinct of all living beings, from animals to spirits, to repay favours and offences in the same coin (207). Care must be taken, however, not to regard all cases of bao1 en as the expression of emotion, spontaneous reaction to the good or bad disposition of others, or mutual (201) Cf. Y? Ch?n-fang, op. cit., p. 113. (202) Cf. Qingshi, 16: 468-98, Qingbao lei. (203) Cf. for example the second tale of the Gujin xiaoshuo, which refers to retribution from the outset. (204) Cf.

(207) In addition to the plot of the tale, see also the poem cited at its beginning: 'All living beings share one common nature, be they mammals or oviparous; if you are human to them, they will not forget ? think of the bird who repaid his protector with rings!' (Xingshi hengyan, Beijing 1986, 6: 118; cf. the transl. in Yang Xiany &amp; Yang Gladys, The Courtesan's Jewel Box, Beijing 1981, p. 65). 426 [50]</page><page sequence="51">affection. In many cases the attitude is dictated primarily by a sense of duty or by the requirements of social convention. If we take some cases of heroism on the part of wives or widows, bao'en is nothing more than the manifestation of one's sense of duty, the recognition of one's social role, when it is not rather the result of selfish desire for fame, a subtle form of revenge, or merely the wish to rid oneself of an excessive burden (208). Such examples recur frequently in stories in the vernacular (209). Bao is also the constant theme of the collection of fourteen stories entitled 'The Stones that Nod' (Shi dian tou), the author of which has still not been identified (210). Whether as retribution-destiny, as revenge on the part of a victim of injustice (baochou) (211), or as the gratitude of a person or spirit who has received a favour (bao'en) (212), the principle of bao is presented as the recompense for the filial piety shown by a daughter who sells herself to save her father (first story), or of the son who abandons family in search of his lost father, or as the reward for the love of a heroic wife separated from her husband (tenth story), or as the triumph of justice in the struggle of a woman against a powerful figure (eighth and twelfth stories). The moral is always the same: wicked conduct is always punished (213), while virtuous conduct is unfailingly rewarded by heaven (214). Love is rewarded in a later reincarnation in the story of a prostitute who kills herself out of despair. In the next life the roles are reversed: she becomes a man and her former lover her wife (fifth story). Reincarnation can thus serve to complete a destiny interrupted by violence or injustice in a previous existence, yi xu qian yuan (ninth story) (215). The refrain repeated in all registers is that 'the pure heaven on high cannot be deceived; even before you form such an intention, it is already known. Good and evil are vindicated in the end; it is just a matter of time' (216). In another important collection entitled 'Stories of Love' (Qingshi), it is stressed that retribution always takes place and also (208) See in particular the wealth of cases of heroism on the part of widows and wives.

In all its various forms, bao is thus an essential component of Chinese intellectual and social life, affecting the sphere of ethics, the conception of destiny, and even the perception of sentiment. 9. Mans Active Position with Regard to Destiny Though they say that our destiny depends upon heaven, how it develops depends upon ourselves. Wang Gen (1483-1541) (218) As we have seen, the widespread belief in destiny from classical Chinese philosophy on does not necessarily imply a passive fatalism (219). Even the Chinese proverb similar to our own 'man proposes, God disposes' (220), warns against trying to force events {b?ke qiang) but does not seek to rob man of his initiative. In the case of popular tradition too, the spirit of death, siming, notes the duration of each person's life in particular registers, but is not thereby empowered to decide destiny arbitrarily as each person bears his own responsibility (221). While destiny is predestined by definition, (217) Cf. Qingshi, 16: 498. (218) Cit. in Shimada Kenji, Zh?goku ni okeru kindai shii no zasetsu, Tokyo 1949, p. 111. (219) For a careful analysis of the meanings of the term ming in pre-Qin philosophy, see T'ang Ch?n-i, op. cit., Philosophy East and West, 11, 4, 1962, pp. 195-218; 12, 1, 1962, pp. 29-49. Cf. for the Ming-Qing period in the literary field, the first story in the collection Paian jingqi by Ling Mengchu (Shanghai 1982), which is emblematic for the stress laid upon the decisive role played by destiny in man's fate but far from advocating a passive, inert fatalism. In the last story of the collection, however, the author does appear to tend towards a more fatalistic stance. For example, the first episode in the tale is about how a candidate for the state examinations, a certain He, happens through a series of coincidences to come into possession of the exam papers beforehand. When he opens them in front of his fellow candidates, only one of them chooses to prepare for precisely those questions, while the others do not even consider the possibility of their being authentic. The final comment is that it all depends on destiny, not only He's good fortune but also the decision of whether or not to regard the papers as genuine (40: 704). However, it must also be borne in mind that the particular theme dealt with hinges upon Ling Mengchu's criticism of how the state examinations were run and how merit, which should have been the foremost consideration, was practically ignored. We are thus forced to conclude that the predominant role attributed to destiny should be seen as a pretext for polemic rather than a reflection of the author's general viewpoint. For that matter, Ling Mengchu remarks at the beginning of the same story that 'it is mistaken to believe that it is pointless to study with diligence because everything is supposed to depend on destiny; one should rather do everything in his power and then place himself in the hands of destiny (literally: of heaven)' (40: 702).

Erkes, The God of Death in Ancient China', TP, 35, 1940, pp. 204-6. 428 [52]</page><page sequence="53">this does not prevent the Chinese from acting in such a way as to modify it, if possible, or at least to reform their lives in order to adapt to the new situation. Though unable to change destiny, even divination is considered useful as man can still try to make reparation or, if nothing else, because it makes it possible to prepare for events, maximizing the advantages and minimizing the disadvantages. For example, in a discussion of the truth and utility of physiognomy, the commentator of one of the 'Tales Ancient and Modern' (Gujin xiaoshuo) asserts that Tor the Way, the features of the face are not the same as the sentiments of the mind. If a man has a very favourable physiognomy but behaves in a manner contrary to conscience, he wastes his virtues and their secret potential and thus comes to a bad end. Conversely, a man with a negative physiognomy and a righteous mind will accumulate secret merits until his misfortunes turn into good fortune. This means that man is master of his own fate and his own nature; in other words, that his determination can overcome his natural disposition and not that physiognomy is ineffective (222). Even the omens of dreams are used to influence destiny in some way (223). This active attitude also appears in religious practices. Man can obtain the favour of spirits and divinities in such as way as to impetrate protection for his own life and those of his family together with his goods, to ensure success in this life, and to obtain indulgence for his sins as well as reincarnation at a superior level. An example of action on the part of common people aimed at modifying their destinies is provided by the wealth of religious and superstitious rites performed, especially in moments of difficulty. Williams Wells observes that the Chinese have an almost infinite variety of superstitious practices, most of which are of a deprecatory nature, arising from their belief in demons and genies that torment or help people. It may be stated that most of the ceremonies celebrated in the temples are aimed at preventing misfortune rather than requesting good fortune. Amulets and magic formulas are worn or hung up to ward away malign influences (224). To a certain extent, destiny can be manipulated by man, also by means of magic. Amulets, talismans and spells were sold by Buddhist and Taoist monks to cure and to prevent illnesses, to protect one for evil spirits, and so on. These talismans generally consisted of small sheets of yellow or red paper bearing inscriptions or images (such as that of the immortal Taoist Zhang Daoling [34-156], Zhang the celestial master) (225). The spells were then burnt and the ashes, mixed with water, were used (222) Gujin xiaosbuo, 9: 134-35. (223) Cf. M. Soymie, 'Les songes et leur interpretation en Chine', Sources Orientales, 2, Paris 1959, p. 293. (224) CF. W. Williams, The Middle Kingdom. A Survey of the Geography, Government, Literature, Social Life, Arts, and History of the Chinese Empire and Its Inhabitants, [1895], New York 1966, II, p. 255. (225) Cf. the section Lingyingshenfo of the almanac Jubao lou of 1987. The term ming ? 'life destiny' ? recurs very frequently, especially in the section referring to the five elements (Ershiliu guansha) and in the Liming. There is a vast literature on the subject, among which the, albeit dated, works by Wieger and De Groot should be recalled. [53] 429</page><page sequence="54">for aspersion or drunk. Among the numerous examples contained in the literature of the utilization of talismans and spells in order to influence destiny in a positive sense, we shall cite the following episode: Mr. Zhao, apparently a gentleman, always had secret plans. One day, he induced a servant in hell, whom he knew personally, to look up in the book his own fate. He learned that he had a long and happy life in store. Now, he committed more and more sinful actes, with the result that his sons died, he himself became sick and poor. Bewildered, he again asked the servant to look up his record. He learned from him that he had lost 20 percent of life and wealth because of intrigues which broke up families; anther 20 percent for whoring and gambling, and still another 20 percent for slaughtering animals and other sins. (226) It can certainly be assumed that the tendency to derive each event from destiny indicates a certain level of fatalism. Good examples of this are provided by certain popular tales in which each propitious or unpropitious event is made to depend upon special situations or circumstances, including the loss of self-control. However, even this fatalism may be regarded as 'optimistic' in that it does not obstruct man in leading his own life but reassures him when misfortune has befallen him and can no longer be avoided. In the words of the shrewd definition formulated by Zhu Guangqian, destiny in China is more similar to Christian Providence than to the Greek Moira, and it is more of an impartial judge than a capricious divinity. According to him, the Chinese firmly believe that virtue will always be rewarded and vice punished, if not in this world, at least in the next. As a just man who suffers misfortune is always regarded as responsible for the faults of a previous existence, the responsibility is always of the victim himself and not of fate (227). In the story 'A Marriage Predestined to Awaken the World' {Xingshiyinyuan zhuan), the protagonist Chao Yuan ignores all the warnings of the spirits and wastes all the good possibilities of his destiny, abandoning himself to depravity despite having learnt through dreams of his previous existence and the disastrous future that awaits him. The story thus demonstrates his responsibility in influencing fate (228). In this context, we cannot ignore the role played by the system of the 'moral books' (shanshu) and of examining one's conscience that became widespread in the latter half of the Ming dynasty. These became the standard bearers of a free-will and anti-fatalistic ideology par excellence that stressed man's ability to forge his own destiny (229), liming. The term is taken from the Book of Mencius and originally (226) Cf. Eberhard, Guilt and Sin..., op. cit., p. 116. (Li Ruzhen affirms, conversely, that constancy and patience are capable of changing bad fortune into good. Cf. Jinghuayuan, 98: 497). (227) Cf. Chu Kwang-Tsien, The Psychology of Tragedy, Hong Kong 1987 (Strasbourg 1933), p. 207. (228) Cf. the analysis carried out by Yenna Wu, op. cit., pp. 93, 95. (229) Cf. the essay by Brokaw, op. cit., to which my own analysis is heavily indebted. 430 [54]</page><page sequence="55">meant 'establishing the [heavenly] will', i.e. that man had only the power to modify himself by winning virtue or by losing it, while success and fortune lay beyond his reach (230). Yuan Huang (1533-1606) gave the term a new meaning: man was in a position to create his own destiny through his conduct. Whereas the ethics of Mencius were self-motivated and an end in themselves, Yuan Huang's system contained a strong utilitarian and practical component taking into account the ideas and influence of some syncretist thinkers of the period, such as Yungu the monk. At the root of his ideas we find an alteration of the original meaning of the source, the same type of manipulation as is found underlying the creation of a new doctrine. Despite his appeal to the authority of Mencius, Yuan himself appears to have been aware of the novelty of his views, and during a conversation with Yungu was to object: 'One can endeavour to become virtuous, good and just, but how can one be sure of winning fame, wealth and prestige?'. To which the monk replied: 'The assertion of Mencius is correct, but you have not understood it. The Sixth Patriarch states that the field of all fortune is simply the mind. If your desires stem from the mind, there is no objective that cannot be achieved. If you seek within yourself, you will obtain not virtue, goodness and justness alone, but also fame, wealth and prestige. The advantages will be both internal and external. This type of pursuit is advantageous. If you do not turn your gaze inward and examine yourself, but confine yourself to running after external objects, then your pursuit will follow an obligatory path and you will receive only that which was already laid down by destiny: you will lose both internal and external advantages. Therefore, this type of pursuit is useless (231). The reference to the teaching of the Sixth Patriarch (Huineng, 638-713) does not appear to be correct in that Huineng made a clear distinction between fortune or prosperity (fu) on the one hand, and moral merits (gongde) on the other, and the mind was associated solely with merit (232). There is, however, another observation to be made with regard to the use of those texts and its 'utilitarianism'. This concerns the conditions that permit benefits derived from the accumulation of merit. Such benefits are not derived directly from good conduct. What is essential is the attitude of the mind, which must be empty and free. This serenity of the mind is a synthesis of the Chan concept of 'non-thought' or 'non mind' with the Confucian concept of 'sincerity': Now early death and long life are opposites, but when the mind is unmoved, what is early death? What is long life? And so too, only after you see no distinction between abundance and deficiency can you determine your fate in regard to poverty or wealth. Only after you see no distinction between failure and success can you determine your own fate in regard to high or low rank. Only after you see no distinction between early death and long life can you determine your own fate in regard to life and death. (23?) Cf. Mencius, 7, a, 1-3; see the preceding section on the tradition of rationalism. (231) Cf. Yuan Huang, Liming pian, 3a-b, quoted in Brokaw, op. cit., pp. 162-63. (232) Cf. ibid., p. 163. [55] 431</page><page sequence="56">[...] When the tiniest speck will not move your mind, then without leaving the realm of desires, right away you can create your conditions at birth [i.e., your inborn goodness]. This, then, is true learning. (233) Similar views are to be found in another 'moral book' of the same period, the 'Diary of the Knowledge of Oneself (Zizhi lu) written by the monk Zhuhong (Yunqi, 1535-1615), who stresses however the target of the freedom of mind. Zhuhong also provides a precise list of good and bad deeds with their respective merits and demerits, but in one passage warns that the superior man 'does good for its own sake, not because he hopes for good fortune. In the same way, he avoids evil not because he fears punishment. The truth is that when a person eliminates evil and cultivates good all day, no sign (xiang) of good or evil appears, nor is there any longer a mind that cultivates itself. In fact, both reward and punishment are in themselves empty (234). To conclude, the texts dealing with destiny contain both rational and retributive elements. The former predominate in the ideology of the upper classes, the latter in that of the lower classes. While the conception of predestination is consolidated by the deterministic and mechanistic ideology of karma, no doubt is cast either on human freedom or on human responsibility, at least at the empirical and pragmatic level, so much so that one could in fact apply the Latin tag 'Faber est suae quisque fortunae' (235). No one ? including Buddha, the divinities of the underworld and the spirit of death ? can change destiny if understood as part of the Way. At the same time, each person is responsible for his own fate. Even yin, the primary and internal cause, is not fixed since it may be modified by circumstances, by secondary, external causes {yuan) which, though representing a pre-established datum, interact with yin to permit a series of variants (236). Destiny itself is thus the fruit of a compromise between factors of predestination and contingent factors. As is acknowledged by thinkers such as Wang Fuzhi, this situation creates a series of spirals and of possibilities in which the human will can manoeuvre by choosing one or another of the ways offered. And it above all the superior man who is attributed, thanks to the virtue of 'sincerity', with the power to cooperate with heaven and earth in the process of the evolution and transformation of the universe. In the words of a well known passage from 'The Golden Mean': 'The most sublime sincerity in the world enables one to realize his own nature to the full; by realizing his own nature, man (233) Cf. Yuan Huang, Liming pian, 5b-6a, quoted in ibid., p. 168. (234) Cf. Zhuhong, Yunqi fahui, 15: lb, quoted in Y? Ch?n-fang, op. cit., p. 116. (235) The popular almanacs show how to use talismans and spells in order to modify destiny. In the section of the above-mentioned almanac on the influence of the stars over everyday life, the general comment lists the advantages of prayer and conscientious sacrifice for each category, including scholars, merchants and women, according to age. The text concludes by stating that those who worship the propitious stars obtain what they ask for; if the stars are unpropitious, at least misfortune is avoided. Cf. the almanac of 1987, Jubao lou, Jiuxing tuxiang jieshuo.

Reward and Punishment after Death; the Agnosticism of the Intellectuals The Eastern Peak is truly prodigious: in the underworld there exists neither injustice nor partiality; nothing escapes attention! What a contrast with the lack of clarity and injustice of the tribunals of this world! (238) In tackling the question of retribution, some mention should be made of punishment and reward post mortem, a question of great importance in the sphere of popular belief, especially due to Buddhist and Taoist influence. The Taoists saw the 'spirit of death' as reducing a man's life in accordance with the gravity of his sins. In cases where the debt was not fully paid, it would be visited upon his descendants. In Buddhism, the concepts of karma and rebirth do not rule out the possibility of punishment in the underworld (239). Good deeds and religious merits can reduce punishment and good conduct is rewarded by reincarnation in a better existence or entry into the Western Paradise. Numerous religious texts contain warnings of the infallibility of the justice of the tribunal of the underworld, which can correct the injustices of earthly judges by intervening both in the present life and after death. The theme is also dealt with frequently in literature, e.g. the sixteenth tale of Erke pat an jingqi, which mentions some exemplary cases (240). This belief in justice post mortem may be summed up in the words of the following poem that ends the fortieth of the 'Tales Ancient and Modern', 'Shen Xiang and the Memorials of Zhuge Liang': For those who have been loyal and just in their past lives, their remains smell sweet and their souls are venerates for all eternity. The souls of the wicked will be plunged into hell so that heavenly retribution may be manifest. (241) As we have seen, the duration of a person's life and his level of wealth or poverty depended on his own personal conduct or upon that of his ancestors. The judges of the underworld sent emissaries to fetch men's spirits upon expiry of the term laid down (237) Cf. Zhongyong, 22. (238) Cf. Erke paian jingqi, Hong Kong 1985, 16: 355. (239) See for example Yinguoshi tu, an account of a fantastic visit to the various underworlds. Cf. H. Dore, Recherches sur les superstitions en Chine, Shanghai 1914-29, VI, pp. 113-15. (240) Cf. Erke paian jingqi, 16: 343-59. (241) Cf. Gujin xiaoshuo, 40: 641. [57] 433</page><page sequence="58">by destiny or subsequent to the reduction of one's life span due to the accumulation of demerits. After natural decease and a burial in accordance with established practice, the celestial soul, hurt, was thought to leave the body and enter into the spirit world. After crossing over the borderline, the hun could be led into paradise, if the person were known for his irreproachable conduct. Otherwise, it was subjected to a sort of preliminary trial consisting in crossing a bridge. If it managed to get across without falling into the jaws of the monsters below, it was brought before ten judges empowered by law to inflict punishment ? cruel tortures such as dismembering, flogging and so on ? in keeping with the gravity of the sins committed. While some souls were kept permanently in hell, most of them went on to their next reincarnation as animals or human beings of various levels. Some of these souls could become judges or divinities of the other world. Thanks to a sort of system of indulgences reminiscent of the Communion of the Saints or the Thesaurus meritorum of Christianity, punishments could be reduced by the good deeds of relatives of the deceased. However, this principle also worked in the other direction, so that the bad conduct of descendants affected the hun of their forebears and brought about an increase in their punishments (242). As was understood also by the first Europeans to study Chinese thought, there was no room in the Confucian Great Tradition for either heaven or hell (243), and the ancient religious beliefs had been rationalized and systematized in the cult of ancestors, which established a continuity and reciprocity within the family in a ritual and cultural bond embracing both living and dead. Bianhuobian, a collection of passages against superstition compiled in the 14th century by Xie Yingfang, contains a wealth of attacks on Buddhist belief in immortality, hell and reincarnation, as well as such religious practices as prayers for longevity, the custom of burning paper money for the dead, various geomantic practices, and so on (244). This rationalist tradition had been carried on by Confucian scholars also against the new 'superstition' brought by European missionaries between the end of the Ming dynasty and the beginning of the Qing. Heaven and hell, concepts taken over by the missionaries from Buddhism, did not exist outside this world. Such was the teaching of Yang Guangxian (1597-1669), the author of works in defence of orthodoxy and in condemnation of Christian heterodoxy, which warned the imperial authorities against the West's expansionist aims and pinpointed the ideas of heaven and divinity as marking the fundamental difference between Christianity and Confucianism (245): (242) Cf.

If we behave well, we obtain a series of advantages; whereas, if we behave badly, we suffer the manifold consequences: these are in reality heaven and hell in this life. But according to their religion (Christianity) hell really exists below and heaven on high [...]. (246) Gu Yanwu provides an unequivocal exposition of the Confucian conception of immanence. Basing his argument on citations from the classics (The Classic of Changes), from Zhang Zai and from other thinkers, he asserts that everything is energy (qi) ? from the bodies into which it condenses to the atmosphere into which it is dispersed ? in an uninterrupted series of transformations. Being made up of energy, souls and spirits are also destined to dissolve (247). Adhering strictly to orthodox views, Gu Yanwu therefore rejects popular Buddhist and Taoist belief in retribution on the part of celestial divinities in this life or the next and asserts the impersonal nature of the heavens (248). Huang Zongxi (1610-1695) provides a good example of a Confucian intellectual endowed with deep religious feeling. His last works deal at length with the problems of the other world. In the section devoted to heaven (Shangdi) in his notes entitled 'Against Error' (Poxie lun), the power of the celestial will is stressed while Buddhist and Christian ideas come in for criticism. In the section on the underworld (Diyu)y he rejects the Buddhist conception of hell also on the grounds that he cannot understand how celestial officials could be so cruel. The section on hun and po denounces belief in the transmigration of souls (249). However, his attitude towards the other world is not completely clear. In the same work, he writes that the hun of sages remain in the world longer than those of common mortals to influence men's lives. Conversely, the hun of ordinary people leave the world immediately upon death but can cause disturbance in the minds of descendants if the rites of purification are not carried out correctly (250). Immortality is thus realized solely through one's descendants and the heavenly souls, who are also destined to dissolve, relive in the veneration of their children and grandchildren. On the contrary, in Du zangshu wendui, his work on burial ceremonies, Huang adheres strictly to the rationalist Confucian viewpoint. After death, (246) Cf.

(249) Criticisms of samsara are also found in his commentaries on Mencius, as in Junzi zhi yu wu, in which he stresses the lack of filial piety inherent in the concept, which desecrates the only relation existing between the individual and his parents [Huang Zongxi quanji, Mengzi shi shuo, Hangzhou 1985-86, 2 vols., 1: 158-59).

Ceremonies for the choice of a propitious time and place are therefore regarded as pointless (251). Writers generally adopted an intermediate viewpoint. While not believing in the possibility of life after death, most of them accepted the idea of retribution to a certain extent, if only in terms of the good or bad reputation that one cultivated during his life and left behind him. In the words of Lu Shiyi (1611-1672): Although it occasionally happens that men full of loyalty and filial piety fall into misfortune while, in contrast, traitors and good-for-nothings are fortunate enough to escape the punishments they deserve, sooner or later, either in the course of this life, once things are sorted out, or in later generations, the worthy are the object of praise and rogues receive their punishment. How could one possibly put one's trust in vain pronouncements about things that one can neither see nor hear. (252) 11. 'Social and Political Destiny The defence of civilization and of the empire rests exclusively upon the humble common folk (253). Just as individual sorrow cannot be regarded as equal to collective misfortune in terms of suffering, so is the destiny of the empire or of a community considered with greater interest than that of an individual. A similar concept is expressed in Gernet's observation that 'Even though Buddhism had introduced the theme of individual salvation into China, this never acquired such importance as the collective well-being of lineages or territories (254). The key concept in the overall working of the social system and the political order is represented by the idea of the 'Heavenly Mandate', tianming. Mention has already been made of the concept and of its retributive basis, which is here applied to the government and the empire rather than to individuals and families. 'Knowing the heavenly mandate means distinguishing the limpid from the muddy' ? this assertion (251) Cf. Du zangshu wendui in Nanlei wending, Taibei 1964, qianji, 11: 169-71; see also Koh Byong-ik, 'Huang Tsung-hsi's (1610-1695) Expectation of the Coming of a New Era', Journal of Social Sciences and Humanities (Seoul), 30, 1969, pp. 67-68. Wang Fuzhi, a contemporary of Huang, held that the souls of the deceased mingled with the darkness as smoke rises from fire, while the mortal remains mingled with the earth as wood is transformed into ash.

The term tianming ? which may be translated as 'destiny' or 'human nature' at the individual level ? takes on the character of the 'universal order' (251) that legitimates or destabilizes the authority of the state, according the Mencian reworking of the concept. The disorder, luan (258), that follows upon or accompanies the loss of the Mandate is unquestionably one of the most serious evils in the Confucian conceptual scheme. It belongs among the moral evils as well as among the physical in that the political dimension affects both spheres. Before dying for his opposition to the usurpation of Yongle (1403-1424), Fang Xiaoru (1357-1402) wrote as follows: 'This disaster comes from heaven, and its causes are not known [...]' (259). What could man do against the loss of good government (zhi)? Was transition from peace and order (fat) to decadence, stagnation and disorder (pi) the inevitable consequence of the alternate evolution of the world? These subjects have been debated in a vast political and historiographical literature from the Classics on (260) and their discussion would lie beyond the scope of the present paper. We shall confine ourselves to providing indications and examples of some of the trends found in the period under examination, with no claim to deal exhaustively with a problem calling for treatment in its own right. The ideal political and social conditions were always regarded as those depicted in the Utopian description of the 'Age of Gold' mentioned in the Liji or Book of Rites. According to the passage in question, the common interest would prevail in the world when the order of the Great Way was established. The worthy would be summoned to public office; men would trust one another and no longer confine themselves to loving just their own parents and children. The aged would thus live out their days in serenity; widows, orphans and the sick would be provided with the necessary assistance; and the young would grow up healthy and well-balanced. Each member of society would carry out his role and functions and there would be neither waste (255) Cf. Sanguo yanyi, 97: 785. (256) Cf. Sanguo yanyi, 93: 751, 97: 787. (257) 'When the Heavenly Mandate has taken aim, there is no known force that can stand up to it': Sanguo zhi, 35: 931. (258) For the responsibility of the sovereign, see, among the many declarations of early Neo Confucianism, the following assertion of Cheng Hao: 'Whether the world is peaceful or chaotic depends on whether the ruler is humane or not'. Cf. Jinsilu jijie, 8: 239; Chan Wing-tsit, Reflections on Things at Hand..., op. cit., p. 215. (259) Cf. the poem written by Fang Xiaoru shortly before his death, cit. in Mingshi, Beijing 1974, 141: 4019. (260) A passage on disorder in the world taken from the 'Memorials on the Rites' (Lift) has been cited above. The following is taken from the 'Classic of Changes' (Yijing) under the hexagram tai: 'The small departs and the great approaches, fortune and success [are guaranteed]. Then heaven and earth unite and all beings enter into relation with one another. Superiors and inferiors unite and their will is one. Light prevails within and darkness without, within lies strength and without obedience, [61] 437</page><page sequence="62">nor negligence. The absence of thieves would make it unnecessary to lock one's front door. This would be the Era of Great Unity (261). In the cyclical interpretation of history still surviving in the Ming and Qing eras, various terms are used to express the alternation of periods of order and disorder. Centuries of historical speculation are reflected in the opening lines of the version by Luo Guanzhong (1330-1400) of one of the most widely read novels, the 'Romance of the Three Reigns' (Sanguo yanyi): Tt is usually claimed that the conditions of the world are such that long division must be followed by unity, and that unity must be followed by division. The reign of Zhou ended in the division of the seven warring states, which were then unified by the Qin; and after the fall of the Qin, Chu and Han fought until the empire was reunified by Han [...]' (262). To remain in the literary field, some centuries later Kong Shangren (1648-1718) was to write something approaching a funeral dirge for the Ming dynasty in his play The Peach Flower Fan' (Taohuashan). In the epilogue, after lamenting the dynasty's sad fate (263), the author voices his own despair in a description of the desolation of the once glorious places of Nanking: [...] Survivors camped in decaying forts, starved horses sprawled in deserted trenches; and over the vasted suburbs, the city wall reflected the setting sun. Sporadic fires had blackened catalpas guarding the Founder's Tomb; long fled were the eunuch attendants, their place assumed by shifting flocks of sheep. Refuse of bird and bat littered the hall, dead leaves and dried twigs carpeted the steps. Where acolytes should be sweeping, herdboys had made a mark of the dragon tablet. Next the royal palace: White marble pillars in a heap of ruins, red-plastered walls a crumbling sea of dust, within superiority and without [moral] inferiority. The way of superiority prevails and that of inferiority declines [...]'. Below the following hexagram pi is written: The wicked of the period of stagnation are not propitious for the superior man. The great departs and the small approaches. Then heaven and earth are out of communion and beings do not enter into relation with one another. Superiors and inferiors do not unite, and in the world there are no tributary countries. [...] Heaven and earth do not unite. Stagnation. The superior man withdraws into his virtue to avoid difficulties, and does not let himself be honoured with revenue'. Cf. the translation by Wilhelm, op. cit., Roma 1950, pp. 323, 327-28. (261) Cf. Li/7, Liyun. (262) Luo Guanzhong, Sanguo yanyi, p. 1. (263) Cf. the ballad of Liu Jingting, Kong Shangren, Taohuashan, Taibei 1983, 4: 257-58. The closing verses are particularly expressive: 'The inlaid pillars of Yangzhou toppled to the ground, the songs fell silent and the halls became cold. Friendless now, the dragon roamed the seas; helpless, the phoenix writhed in the dust; our emperor was consigned [...]. Weeds choked the Palace pools, darkness enfolded the avenue and the imperial tombs. City after city, the gates were opened wide [to the invading Manchu], and impossible was the defence of Zuo Langyu, Shi Kefa and Huang Degong. Jianwen fled clad as a bonzi; Chongzhen killed himself; Zhengtong became a prisoner of war, Zhengde a degenerate. Besides these, Prince Fu ruled for just one year, his memorial a few lines of bitter tears' (ibid., 4: 258; cf. the translation by Chen Shih-hsiang and Harold Acton in collaboration with C. Birch, in The Peach Blossom Fan, Berkeley 1976, p. 306). 438 [62]</page><page sequence="63">shattered tiles in profusion, hardly a glazed square left in any window. None but the swallow posturing before the Screen of Audience, only the tall weeds marching down the central avenue; and resident in the palace, no one but beggars and men dead of starvation. The Qinhuai pleasure-quarter, where we spent our days: torn window-papers rustled in the breeze, the river lapped across broken sills, no sight but filled the eye with sorrow. Where now do flutes play soft for the powdered beauties we knew? At the Midsummer Feast the lantern boats are dark, at Midautumn the wineshop flags stay furled. [...] The stream flows on, but few men cross; and in the cold sunset only a single willow dances slow. I came to the old pleasure-house: no need to knock, no fear the dog would bark. A dried-up well, an abandoned nest, moss-covered tiles, the steps sprouting weeds. The trees we planted, you and I, had been stripped at random for fuel ? and whose were the ashes of this cooking-fire? [...] How could I dream that all would vanish like the melting of ice? I saw the crimsom balconies rise, I saw the feasting of the guests; I have seen all lie in ruins. Where moss creeps over the rubble, in times long gone I dreamed of love and glory. Now I have seen it all, the rise and decay of half a hundred years [...]. (264) Besides the cyclical conception (265) and the idea of the Heavenly Mandate, the other basic element taken into consideration with regard to changes in general conditions was the concept of qi or 'energy', often used in combination with the other two. As mentioned above, its changes involved a series of consequences both for the individual and for society. Yan Yuan (1635-1704) asserted that the dynamism of energy, qiji, went through phases of decay and growth, of disorder and of peace. While these ceaseless changes depended upon destiny (lishu, qishu) and were thus beyond human control, man had an important part to play in quickening or slowing down the process. With regard to this role, he wrote the following: If there had been someone like Yao, Shun, the Duke of Zhou or Confucius, a period of decadence would certainly have given way to one of growth, a period of disorder to one of peace. And even if, in their absence, there had been a Duanmu Zigong, Ziyou (Yan), Zixia (Bu Yan), Zilu (Zhongyou), Ran Geng (Boniu), or Ran Yong (Zhonggong) [all disciples of Confucius], such a one would have been able to transmit the Way with no interruption and to teach the true doctrine without error until the return of the time of growth and peace.

[63] 439</page><page sequence="64">Among the more significant examples, one should also recall Gu Yanwu's ideas on the 'fall of a dynasty' (wangguo) and on the 'ruin of human civilization' (wangtianxid) (267). While maintaining a strong moralistic tone in his interpretation of history, Gu Yanwu introduces the concept of 'historical condition' (shi) as a dynamic phenomenon (bian) that goes beyond the moralistic, magical and religious explanations connected with this or that figure to consider the conduct of both the ruling class and the people (268). The 'seven ills' (qi wang) and 'seven deaths' (qi si) of Wang Wei are similar but more directly related to individual conditions. They include both natural catastrophes such as famine, plague, flood and drought and sufferings occasioned by human injustice and cruelty (269). Redemption from these moral and physical ills constitutes the basis of humanistic and worldly Chinese 'soteriology'. An example of a different viewpoint may be found in Wang Fuzhi, whose ideas made a great contribution to the progress of Chinese thought on this subject. His pragmatic and utilitarian approach ? which suggest that he was strongly influenced by legalist theories ? do not rule out the traditional ethical conception of the state. With an emphasis far greater than that found in any Confucian before him, Wang Fuzhi stresses the identity between the world of necessity and that of morality in history ? understood in the dynamic sense on the model of seasonal renewal, though allowing for its own specific nature ? deriving from the factor of cultural development (wen). Far from being based upon an overestimation of what 'must be', this identity derives the 'rational' from the 'real'. According to his dynamic conception of history ? understood as continuous production and reproduction, as a manifold of changes and transformations ? conditions evolve with the passing of time through the alternation of phases of order and prosperity with phases of disorder and calamity (270). Historical development hinges upon the so-called conditions and tendencies (shi), which lie beyond human intention or will. As the times change, new circumstances require different systems and methods, and the old ones lose all validity. This does not mean that morality is ignored in political affairs or that there exists a contradiction between the irreversible historical tendencies and the statesman's moral objectives. It simply means that there is no absolute and immutable method and that criteria are dictated solely by the changing of the situation. As the principle is inherent in energy and cannot exist outside it, it is likewise inherent in the actual conditions (267) Cf. P. Santangelo, 'Gu Yanwu's Contribution to History: the Historian's Method and Tasks', EW, 32, 1-4, 1982, pp. 169-70. (268) Cf. Gu Yanwu, Rizhilu, 2, Yin Zhou zhi suoyi wang, Wuwangfa Zhou, Taishi, in Rizhilu jishi, 2: 31-34. Compare the question of transition from one dynasty to another (from the Shang to the Zhou in this case) with the previous literature (Mencius, 1, 2, 8; Zhu Xi, Zhuzi yulei, 51: 1227-28. See also Huang Zongxi, Huang Zongxi quanji, Mengzi shi shuo, Fang Jie fa Zhou, 1: 56-57). (269) Wang Wei, Zhici, p. 4a-b. (27?) A good example is provided by his treatment of the necessity of alternation between periods of peace and periods of disorder in Siwenlu waipian, Zhongguo zhexueshi ziliao xuanji, Qindai zhi hu, p. 191. 440 [64]</page><page sequence="65">of reality. To be more precise, it is identified with the necessity of such conditions, which are nothing more than its manifestations. A condition that either loses or does not contain the principle ceases to be a condition and cannot last long. The great sages therefore consider principles as though they were conditions and follow principles according to conditions (271). It is therefore man's task to act in accordance with the moral precepts and to acquire the capacity to modify certain particular situations so as to ensure conformity to them. Good intentions are not enough to govern well, because an insufficient understanding of the circumstances and lack of skill in controlling them necessarily lead to failure. While politicians such as Qin Shihuangdi unquestionably act in ways contrary to the moral precepts, heaven thus makes use of their capacities as its unwitting tools, thanks to which the Way introduces its changes into history. The remark tian jia qi si yi xing qi dagong ? 'heaven has taken advantage of the selfishness [of Qin Shihuangdi] in order to carry out its own general interest (272) ? recalls the well-known theory of the 'cunning of reason', with the difference that there is no underlying teleological inspiration. The old fengjian or, feudal system, in operation during the Zhou dynasty (1066P-721 B.C.) ? under which the hereditary nature of public offices made it impossible to employ the best talents ? necessarily had to be replaced by the more rational and functional system of 'prefectures and districts' (junxian). As this reform is traditionally attributed to the violent emperor Qin Shihuang, Wang Fuzhi explains how even historical conditions that do not appear to conform to the principle can, in fact, identify with it at the moment of change (273). This process corresponds to natural evolution ? the will of heaven acting for the good of the universe ? and constitutes the splendid union of reality and principle, of necessity and morality (274). Though man may suffer at the time, in a larger historical perspective, the advantage is great and the way of the sages is broadened. The will of heaven thus corresponds to this process and the sages must work to further it, provided that the time is ripe (275). Among the collective disasters, Wang Fuzhi included the decadence of the empire, its division and invasion by foreign powers. Since decline and disorder have their own rules, men must take care not to let the situation degenerate to such an extent that it becomes irreparable, that it reaches a point of no return (hi wang zhi shi), as he says of the downfall of the Song (276).

[65] 441</page><page sequence="66">In conclusion, the conditions and necessities of history transcend man's will and his efforts if he does not undertand the times and adapt to them. ic ic Speaking in more general terms, it may be observed that contrasting theories were developed within Neo-Confucianism itself with regard to a fundamental point of historiographical and political thought, i.e. the morality of destiny. These theories range from scepticism to fideism, from subjectivism to mechanical determinism, and may be summarized in the following four basic viewpoints. 1) Heaven is possessed of understanding and will and is identified with a moral and providential destiny. 2) Heaven loves good but cannot act directly and therefore makes use of intermediaries such as the people or the literary class, and so on. 3) Heaven possesses neither understanding nor will, but there does exist a moral tendency in the universe (principle or positive energy). 4) Destiny is the necessity derived from the chance combination of the elements; it is amoral and indifferent to human conduct. There is a marked predominance of views which justify destiny and seek to bring out its ethical aspects. Even the assertion of its amorality or indifference ends up by acknowledging it a certain 'rationality' or logic, albeit beyond the grasp of the common man. Rather than contrast human ethics with destiny, the heroism or desperation of the individual in the face of an external evil neither deserved nor justified, Chinese culture tends to celebrate man's capacity to accept destiny while penetrating its secret codes in such a way as to then dominate or modify it. The concepts of retribution discussed above are intended both in the sense of retributive justice (i.e. everyone is rewarded or punished in proportion to his merits and demerits) and in the corrective sense (i.e. there is an exact correspondence between merit and reward or crime and punishment). In their various forms, they may be regarded as a type of prescription or technique for the pursuit of practical happiness that also takes the moral order into account. Social rules and internal equilibrium are the conditions for obtaining either individual or social advantages. Punishment and reward follow the naturalistic principle of cause and effect, but at the same time transcend it through the qualification of actions according to certain standards of value, combining a utilitarianism of legalistic type with a Confucian type of moralism. From the examples examined so far there emerges a single but twofold set of problems focused upon destiny. On the one hand, stress is laid upon the futility of rebelling against reality and the course of events; hence the practically unanimous acceptance of destiny, the attempt to penetrate this deeper dynamism, the tendency towards serene adaptation to reality. On the other hand, attention is focused upon the more directly human aspect: the moral and other consequences of conduct, its repercussions upon the universe and upon the life of the individual, and hence the question of retribution and the limits within which one may intervene in his own destiny and that of humanity. 442 [66]</page></plain_text>
