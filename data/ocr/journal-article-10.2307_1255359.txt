Venezelos, and the straight shooting of certain Greek troops. Certainly folklore is not killed by modern progress in Greece at any rate. In conclusion we must note that Laographia is one of the few sources from which really reliable information about moder Greek customs can be obtained. The English and German books on this subject are often inaccurate, and a number of corrections of them are made in passing, particularly by Prof. Polites. H. J. ROSE. DRACHEN UND DRACHENKAMPFER.

[GREEK POPULAR SONGS ON ST. GEORGE AND THE DRAGON.] Reprinted from Laographia, vol. iv. By N. G. POLITES. Athens, I913. THESE two works handle from different points of view a portion of the vast collection of known tales of dragon-fighting heroes. M. R6heim's little work, confessedly not nearly a complete treatise on so gigantic a subject, endeavours to steer clear of the hasty assumptions and unjustified generalizations which have marred the labours of many of his predecessors. He combats especially the tendency to reject without sufficient investigation the astral explanation of the myth. We think that he goes too far in the other direction; but we.most heartily agree with his protest against the tendency to refer to one source all myths, or for that matter all customs, which happen to have a family resemblance to one another. There is, as he well reminds us, such a thing as con- vergence in folklore as in biology (p. 55), and, as in the latter case whales have modified their structure until they closely resemble fishes, so in the former we may have myths from totally different sources following a similar line of development and coming to appear almost identical. I32</page><page sequence="2">Reviews. I33 He distinguishes several types of dragon, using the word in the wide sense of any bestial enemies of heroes of popular legend. We have in the first place water-demons (p. 6); naturally enough, as dragons are mostly of reptilian shape, and snakes live for the most part in or near water. Hence we get dragons of mountain torrents, and hence of mountains in general. (We should say that the presence of serpents on rocky hills was alone enough to account for this; indeed R6heim owns as much.) Hence dragons of volcanoes (p. 9); dragons of trees and woods (ibid.). All these arise more or less directly out of actual snakes, and hence the frequent motif of the bird which fights or helps to fight the dragon. This bird develops into a totemic ancestor of bird-form, and hence into an anthropomorphic hero. We object here to this free and easy use of the word "totemism," which is still unfor- tunately prevalent on the Continent, and also to the assumption that the theriomorphic hero belongs to one stratum and the anthro- pomorphic to another. Less directly connected with natural history are the dragons of sickness, a particular species of the theriomorphic demons of disease (p. I3); the dragon who develops out of the belief that the dead appear in snake-form and hence is a guardian of buried treasure and later the warden of Hades (pp. 15 et seq.). The combination of soul-serpent and soul-bird gives us the flying dragon (p. 23). (We doubt this.) Finally we have the huge variety of celestial dragons, developed out of such things as the dark half of the moon which devours the light half, the monster which causes eclipses or sunset by devouring the luminary; the cloud- or rain-dragon, who has affinities with the river-dragon, and so on. The heroes who fight these miscellaneous monsters are of equally varied character, such as the sorcerer who destroys the dragon of sickness (p. 24); the Sun which conquers the storm- dragon (p. 35),-this we can be sure of from the numerous cases in which "nicht der Erklarer, sondern die JMythe selbst von Sonne und Mond es erzahlt," and so forth. All this is amply illustrated with a series of references to the literature of folklore, and we agree with the general conclusions. We would, however, take a further step in the analysis, and insist that the general trend of the legends of the particular people</page><page sequence="3">134 Reviews. whose dragon-myth we may happen to be considering should be carefully examined before attempting to explain the myth itself. Then, if we find a fair proportion of astral myths, for example, we may acquiesce in M. R6heim's dictum that in this case "mutato nomine de Sole fabila narratur" (ibid.). If, on the other hand, we find a predominance of the cult of the dead, or of river-spirits, we may put the dragon and his slayer into the corresponding classes. Thus we would cheerfully accept a Modoc sun-dragon- slayer; but, when the myth originates in Greece, we look rather for a river-, spring-, or earth-deity of some sort who has taken dragon form. M. Polites draws our attention particularly (pp. 207 et seq.) to the prevalence of the water-guarding dragon in Greek myth, ancient and modern. He instances the Hydra, Python, and others, and suggests that the churlish Amykos, who prevents the Argonauts from watering until Polydeukes overthrows him, is developed out of a similar monster. To this type St. George's dragon conforms. By an acute analysis of a number of variants of a popular song on the subject,-a song by the way which is not without a certain beauty of its own,-he arrives at the conclusion that the legend is not taken from the ecclesiastical lives of the saint, into which indeed it intrudes quite late, but is due to a relic of the Perseus myth, preserved in popular traditions, most likely those of Anakou or Eneghi in Cappadocia. Like M. R6heim and most other writers, he sees in the exposed princess a relic of actual human sacrifice. H. J. ROSE. DESPRE CIMILITURI. By G. PASCU. Part I., Philological Study.

From both points of view, therefore, it may prove of interest to draw attention to the publications above, which have appeared in Jassy and Bucharest. Dr. G.
