<plain_text><page sequence="1">117 THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF IDEALISM AND REALISM. BY GUSTAVUS GEORGE ZERFFI, EsQ., PH.D., F.R.S.L., FELLOW OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY. I.-GREEK PERIOD. "GENERALIZATIONS drawn from particulars are the jewels of knowledge, comprehending great store in a little room," says the immortal Locke. The more I see of our learned societies, the more I study the curricula of our different schools and educational establishments, the more thoroughly am I con- vinced that we persistently neglect the study of general history from a higher and a philosophical point of view; in fact, we appear scarcely to have attained the faculty to distin- guish between geography, archaeology, genealogy, biography, ethnology, chronicles, heraldry, statistical reports, numismatics, and extracts from registers. We call everything that has happened history, and consider an old civic record, as devoid of influence on the destinies of humanity as the name, age, occupation, and domestic relations of one of the mummies under a glass case in our British Museum, an historical docu- ment of value. We are apt to confuse the task of the antiquary or of a contributor to Notes and Queries with that of the historian. The historian undoubtedly requires details, and cannot do without them. But not every collection of details is history in a higher sense. Conscientious "archive-copyists " abound among us to an overwhelming extent. All is historical de- tail; there are heaps of historical materials, not yet arranged into a systematic and organic building. Bricks and stones, iron girders, cross-beams, cornices, pillars, consoles and chimney-pots are plentiful. But the architects are rare, and it cannot be detrimental to our Society and its future destiny 9*</page><page sequence="2">118 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY. to devote ourselves, at least sometimes, to the constructive duties of philosophical historians, trying to trace laws in isolated historical phenomena, and thus using the mass of detailed antiquarian material for some higher purpose. I am the last to look down upon those who toil in record offices or copy old documents; but I certainly could wish them to refrain from decrying those who devote themselves to the building up of theories to further the progressive intel- lectual development of humanity. Universal history is with us still in its infancy, though we were the first to teach its peremptory necessity to other nations who have followed the hint thrown out by Boling- broke, and have recognised the truth " that human knowledge has only one store-house, history." I know that it is looked down upon in our universities and colleges as incapable of a scientific treatment. It is generally assumed that history is but an incomplete mass of more or less verified incidents. But it is history that liveson, as the only true " Logos " in the intellectual consciousness of humanity. As soon as education had been freed from the fetters of medieval scholasticism and theology, it could do no more without history in all its ethical, political, and artistic branches of instruction. Wher- ever the historical basis of tuition is neglected or ignored, real culture of the mind is impossible. Every historian requires a philosophical mental training, so as to be able to grasp heterogeneous facts in their inner connections, to understand the forces working in humanity, and to see in the variegated and complicated phenomena of man's actions a homogeneous whole. Reason and imagination are equally acted upon by the study of universal history; "an historian who is without a philosophical and poetical mind is a poor historian," says W. von Humboldt. Leibnitz, in pronouncing the words " le present est charge du passd et gros de l'avenir," laid down the principle of a new method of treating history. For history is the record of man's moral and intellectual deeds, done under certain conditions, in certain places, and at certain times, and thesephenomena, together with the causes that produced them,</page><page sequence="3">HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF IDEALISM AND REALISM. 119 make up history. Not every action of man, however, deserves to be recorded, but only such as mark the life of humanity in its different phases of progressive or sometimes apparently retrogressive development. We have special or pragmatic, and general or universal histories. There is as wide a differ- ence between an accountant and a mathematician, an herbalist and a botanist, a miner and a geologist, as there is between a biographer and an historian; and among the latter again, special and general historians are to be distinguished. " All history," as I said in the first paper I had the pleasure of reading before you, " is information acquired by inquiry;" but "universal history" is not contented with the informa- tion acquired by means of inquiry; it has a higher aim, and endeavours to trace the causes of at least the most striking phenomena, so as to discover a certain law in the interaction of cause and effect in the destinies of mankind. Modern his- torians reject the theories of chance, predestination, or free will, and endeavour to prove phenomena to be the result of man's self-conscious or unconscious activity by means of the static or moral, and the dynamic or intellectual forces with which he is endowed, and trace the working of these forces according to physiological or psychological laws, or a combi- nation of both. The theory of development is altogether new in history. Historians were content to collect dry facts as they pre- sented themselves chronologically in so-called state or other documents; or they taught history under the influence of preconceived facts, as is customary in our schools, beginning with Biblical traditions, treating ancient states according to the Book of Daniel, as did Melanchthon and Bossuet. Or they wrote history, as Macaulay stated in his essay on " Hallam's Constitutional History," from a party point of view; for "every political sect has its esoteric and its exoteric school, its abstract doctrines for the initiated, its visible symbols, its imposing forms, its mythological fables for the vulgar." As long as history is written on such principles, we shall be obliged to do without general historians in the scientific sense</page><page sequence="4">120 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY. of the word. The real historian has to deal above all with the two sides of every question; he has to divest himself of his individual sympathies and antipathies. He has undoubt- edly to exert his individual capacity to discern right and wrong, truth and falsehood; and though he cannot appeal like the physicist to our outward senses with mathematical preci- sion, he may arouse our higher reasoning and imaginative faculties. His success in solving this difficult problem will depend upon his impartiality, his unprejudiced mind, his love of justice, and his philosophically trained intellect, freed from all religious and political prejudices, so as to prevent him from becoming in the treatment of the past either biassed or one-sided. Nothing is more detrimental to history than party spirit; it blinds our clear vision, deadens our faculty of hear- ing, and makes us unjust towards those whom we look upon as adversaries. This is the reason why we often treat best those subjects that are locally and chronologically farthest removed from our country and times. Scientific universal history becomes the more necessary the more the different special branches of science increase in details. History has to con- nect the apparently isolated facts, to trace in the discordant voices of generations and their complicated actions union and harmony; for history is the bright genius that soars high above particulars ; it is the echo of man's most secret yearn- ings, showing in the various incidents of human life the common elements of a universal brotherhood. From the very first dawn of consciousness man tried to solve the phenomena surrounding him in two divergent ways, which up to our times have been followed by two opposed parties. The controversy between idealists and realists, or materialists, is as old as man's power of thinking. The history of man's intellectual development in a wider sense is but the struggle between the two. To trace the action and reaction of these two agents in human history should be both interesting and useful. It would be presumption on my part to attempt to exhaust this subject ; I intend only to draw broad outlines, to suggest and to excite investigation or contradiction.</page><page sequence="5">HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF IDEALISM AND REALISM. 121 I purpose dividing my subject into a series of papers, treat- ing of the Historical Development of Idealism and Realism in four groups,-Greek, Roman, Mediaeval, and Modern. The cosmogonies of the East and the Greeks are the foun- dation of all so-called science in ancient times. Man did not try at first to explain the origin of the universe and of himself from an ideal or material point of view, and least of all scientifically, but invoked the aid of anthropomorphic world- makers-some kind of half-real, half-spiritual being (or beings), who sifted like a clever chemist the chaotically mixed forces and elements, and left them to struggle, to grow and decay according to chance. The creatures, and the earth which they inhabited, were realities; the Creator and his working were ideal assumptions, clad in a more or less realistic shape. With this antagonism the combat began. The think- ing minds of antiquity very early opposed these assumptions; they were eager to find in the chaotic phenomena of nature, and in man's actions, unity, order, and law. With this effort to trace law on one side, and to assume, on the other, an active band of gods and goddesses, the action and reaction in the spiritual destinies of mankind were set in motion. The Greeks were undoubtedly the first people in whom this struggle took an intelligible shape and form. I know that the Indians went through the same phases of spiritual contest. The Vedantic idealism engendered the Vaiseschika system of materialism by Kanada, and Sankhya tried to reconcile these antagonistic systems. But the Greeks are so much more approachable by us, that I hope not to be accused of a wilful omission in beginning with them. The development in all thinking nations with reference to this struggle has been the same, and, moreover, must be the same. The orthodox priesthood of Greece, representing the ideal element, was not less intolerant than the Brahmans of India or our own medieval Torquemadas. Thales of Miletus was to them an atheist. Anaxagoras was imprisoned, and saved his life by flight. Sokrates had to poison himself. Protagoras had his writings publicly burnt, and had to fly</page><page sequence="6">122 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY. from his country. Aristotle had to leave Athens, to spare it the disgrace of again dishonouring itself by persecuting a free- thinker. Theodorus was hated as an unbeliever, and Diogenes of Apollonia had to share his fate. So soon as man became conscious of his faculty of inquiry he used it, and used it either to verify the origin of all things, or to make himself acquainted with the working forces of nature. With the study of mathematics, geometry, and natural sciences, the first steps towards civilization commenced. The fact that this movement began with the Greeks in those parts of their country which were in a continuous intercourse with Egypt, Persia, and Phoenicia, proves that they received the germs of these sciences from those countries. The Greeks had the merit of bringing order, system, and intelligible form into everything they inherited from the East. Their speculations concerning the universe and its connection had many shortcomings, but they were the first to lay down generalizations in a sharp and intelligible form; they furnished us continually with starting- points, which they did not fix as unchangeable, metaphysical, or theological truths ; they were the first to provide the world with scientific deduction. We look down upon deduction as a mere play of individual opinions, and while we are more stationary in this very sphere of man's ideal activity, we strive, on the other hand, towards a coarse materialism, which assumes that beyond ponderables and measurables there is nothing worth knowing. We ignore that, after all, our modern mode of thinking, inquiring, and inventing for practical pur- poses is but the natural sequence of those old Greek philoso- phers who looked into the order of things more from a deductive point of view, with the often unconscious power of intuition; but they very early tried to regulate not only quantities and the sizes of bodies, but also the subtle quality of our mode of thinking and our power of ratiocination. The Greeks were, after all, the first to free our dim eyes from the veil of the miraculous, the fabulous, the mythical, and the imaginary. These elements took their origin in man's fantasy and in his intellectual power; and it was deduction</page><page sequence="7">HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF IDEALISM AND REALISM. 123 that led to induction, it was the idea that fixed the properties of matter. " I am a body, and I think," was the beginning of the atomistic theory. It was Diogenes of Apollonia who pro- pounded the hypothesis that air is the pervading primitive substance, engendering order and reason. The Eleatic school worked also in this direction. The Pythagoreans recognised numbers-but numbers of what ?-as the foundation of the phenomena of nature, numbers of which the monad, forming diads, was the origin-of atoms, in fact, which was a further step to recognise in the phenomenal world the mysterious in the visible, the complicated in the simple, the unknown in the knowable. One of the mightiest intellects of antiquity was Demokritos, of whom we know scarcely more than the sobriquet "the laughing philosopher." It is usual to nickname obnoxious thinkers, to call them flippant, superficial, or taunt them with hiding their ignorance under satirical phrases, because the "dullards " of all times most hate the intellectual products of those whom they can least refute. It was the immortal merit of Lord Bacon to have pointed out Demokritos as the founder of real science. This was the more praiseworthy, as Bacon was spitefully unjust to Aristotle, whom he dragged out of his times and circumstances, and branded as a pro- pounder of empty phrases and hollow knowledge. Lord Bacon was not endowed with the faculty of historical apprecia- tion, and acted towards Aristotle as many modern French and German philosophers, who judge Bacon by the light of modern knowledge, act towards himself. It must be remembered that without Aristotle no Bacon, and without Bacon no Cousin, Kant, Hegel, or Schoppenhauer would have been possible. Nor must we ignore that Demokritos intellectually engendered Epikurus ; and that Bacon, after humanity had passed through the unavoidable circle of errors for nearly 2,000 years, reaching the transition point of a more correct reasoning, had to begin again where Demokritos and Epikurus had left off. The most important principle laid down by Demokritos was, freely translated, "Do not let us strive after quantity of</page><page sequence="8">124 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY. knowledge, but after quality of understanding." Demokritos opposed both Sokrates and Plato, because they turned philo- sophy into mere verbiage and dialectics, without having any firmer foundations for their assertions than mere assumption. Both Sokrates and Plato became the props and pillars of idealists, whilst Demokritos laid down those principles which served the realists as a basis for their investigations. Demokritos laid down six principal axioms, and these are still the discussed points of our latest philosophical inquiries on a scientific basis. He already acknowledged that- I. "From nothing comes ,nothing. Nothing that exists can be destroyed. All changes are due to combination and separation of particles (atoms or molecules)." Kant places this principle as the first analogon of experience. " Notwith- standing all the changes to which the phenomenal is subject, the absolute essence remains the same, and its quantity can neither increase nor decrease in nature." Of course so long as imagination in humanity was stronger than knowledge, or the logical mode of inquiry weaker than the tendency towards assuming causes which stood in no relation to certain effects, man argued, talked, and built up systems and theories on the origin of all things and the creation out of " nothing." This gave rise to many discussions by which, if truth did not gain, our dialectics were at least sharpened, till we came to the conviction that inquiry was after all essential to prove that the combination and separation of something real must pro- duce the phenomenal in the universe. 2. " Nothing happens by chance. Every phenomenon has its cause, from which it follows by necessity." This axiom was already attributed to Leukippos, but without sufficient evidence. It does away with all teleology; for the cause (Xdyoc) is, according to Demokritos, nothing but a mathemati- cal and mechanical law, by which the atoms are ruled in their movements with unconditional necessity. This assertion pro- duced the same accusation which realists have to encounter in our days. They were taunted with elevating blind chance on the tripod of deification. There are scarcely any more</page><page sequence="9">HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF IDEALISM AND REALISM. 125 antagonistic notions than chance and necessity, and yet the two are continually confounded. The notion of necessity is clear, intelligible, and fixed; the notion of chance expresses merely a relative vague notion; it is partially the negation of an aim. Those who in whatever shape or form ascribe the phenomena of nature to an absolute final cause, exclude chance as distinctly as those who assume a law of causation. The idealist has an easier task with his assumption of an absolute final cause. Whatever presents itself to his astonished senses is set down as the result of an incomprehensible final cause for a distinct anthropomorphic aim, and anything contradic- tory or unintelligible in relation to this aim is left as a great mystery, without which mankind could not exist. But this never would have led us to knowledge. Knowledge begins where mystery ceases. This does not eliminate the ideal, or altogether do away with the mysterious. Only the mysterious, instead of becoming something debatable and apparently scientific, becomes the merely unknowable, and the conviction that there are unknowables is the highest gain of science. The assumption of necessity and law in nature led to a rational study of nature. 3. " Nothing exists but atoms and space; all else is mere opinion." This is the weak and strong side of realism in one single statement. The phenomena we study in modern times are resolved into their smallest component parts which are found to be in motion. Thus only we are enabled to explain sound, light, heat, electricity, and taste. Athens entered a protest against this atomistic principle, and tried to prove that the ideal is something separate, not only acted upon, but freely acting. The bridge of union between the acting and acted upon was not yet found. Even if we assume that physicists may yet be able to find out a perfect theory of " brain functions," and distinctly show the mechanical origin and action of sensations, and thus explain the most im- portant actions of a living creature according to a law of con- servation of force, developed in the brain under the influence of nervous irritation, setting vital energy into motion, it will</page><page sequence="10">126 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY. still remain an eternal mystery how the simplest sensation becomes that of a certain subject, my own subjective sensation, and how this my subjective impression corresponds to the same phenomenon produced in the objective world beyond myself. Demokritos answered the assertion of the Eleatic school, "that all such impressions were mere illusions," with the counter-assertion that this depended on the quality of our senses. "The notions sweet, bitter, heat, cold, colour, were matters of opinion; in reality, only atoms and the empty space existed." According to him thinking was even of greater importance than experience. His thinking was con- stantly reduced to observation, and saved him from the error into which experimentalists often fall, of arguing inductively from an experiment in which they do not succeed, that the experiments of another which have succeeded cannot be right, and that a theory based on such or such an experiment is impossible. Such reasoning leads to a dangerous dogmatism, that has often hindered the progressive development of humanity for hundreds, nay, thousands of years. 4. "The atoms are infinite in number and infinite in form. In eternal motion of falling through infinite space, the larger that fall quicker strike the smaller; this produces lateral motions, and the whirlings which thus arise are the beginnings of worlds. Innumerable worlds are forming side by side, and others perish one after the other." These words are in our modem times far more understood than they were in ancient philosophy. Epikurus and Lucretius referred to them, though Epikurus did not admit the infinity of atomic forms. The lateral motion of Demokritos is of great importance. He certainly assumed that heavier bodies fall quicker in empty space than smaller ones. But he explained correctly the beginning of rotation according to the known laws of me- chanics. Aristotle attacked Demokritos's theory about the accelerated fall of the larger atoms, and Epicurus, influenced by him, asserted his theory of the deviation of atoms from a centre, without being able to prove his hypothesis, or to assign for it a plausible reason. Aristotle propounded further,</page><page sequence="11">HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF IDEALISM AND REALISM. 127 if there were such a thing as empty space (which he did not admit), all bodies must fall with equal velocity, as the differences in the swiftness of a fall were occasioned by the varying densities of the mediums through which the bodies fall-say, water or air. Aristotle more or less consciously arrived at results since borne out by modern science. Epikurus advanced the same theory, but he was terser in his statement. Because no resistance of any sort is possible in a vacuum, therefore all bodies must fall with equal velocity. This was hypothetically in accordance with modern science, but only hypothetically, as the ancients had no correct knowledge of gravitation, or of the laws of velocity. Still Galileo, un- doubtedly aided by the ancients, was capable of asserting his law of the equal velocities of bodies, which could only be proved efficaciously by means of the air-pump. 5. " The varieties of all things depend upon the varieties of their atoms in number, size, form, and order of aggrega- tion; a qualitative distinction of the atoms does not exist. The atoms have no 'inner conditions,' they only impress each other through pressure and motion." This assertion reduces all phenomena to touch, and the sensation produced by it. Materialism or realism turns thus into dead formalism. This was already observed by Aristotle. He raised the forms in a transcendental way into causes of motion, and by this means cut at the very root of the study of nature. Kant, in his "Critic of Pure Reason," tried to throw light on a mystery, which, in spite of all progress in natural sciences, is as incom- prehensible as in the times of Demokritos. How and when do these atoms come to subjective and objective consciousness ? 6. "The soul (consciousness) consists of fine, smooth, and round atoms, like those of fire. These atoms are the most mobile of all; they interpenetrate the whole body, and in their motions all phenomena of life arise." Like Diogenes of Apollonia, Demokritos assumes the soul to be special matter; he considers it an entity differing in essence from the atoms forming bodies. This is a theory which would not suit many of our modern mechanical realists, who do not</page><page sequence="12">128 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY. admit of a spiritual element in creation. Demokritos made this division and built upon it his ethics. The soul is with him the essential is man. The body is only the vessel of the soul. The soul is first to be taken care of. Bodily beauty without intellect is animal. Demokritos, is said, to have been the first to assert a special divine soul in the universe. Aristotle laughed at this "soul " of Demokritos, and compared it to the quicksilver with which Daedalus filled his moveable wooden dolls; but the assertions of Aristotle that the soul works only through selection and thinking does not solve the mystery of the absolute entity of the soul. Selecting and thinking are mere faculties of a force which cannot be mere thinking and selecting. The savage or the superstitious may both equally talk about this superior faculty in man, but this does not scientifically answer the question, what is the essence of the " soul-entity "? can it and does it exist without matter ? Demokritos did not speak of a force that created the world, but only of a force that evolved itself in matter and became a phenomenal entity through this evolution, manifesting itself in law. The shortcoming of the realists and materialists is that they stop suddenly when they trace in matter the possi- bility of mind, or when they have proved that mind is the mere effect of matter, which is its primitive and essential cause. But with the effect, as mind, in reality all higher problems of history and philosophy begin. He who ventures with so-called a priori conclusions, originating in a faculty of which matter is an indispensable cause, to settle out of his own inner consciousness the phenomena of nature, whether his name be Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Butler, Hegel, or Sir Wm. Hamilton, only destroys the basis of real knowledge, which ought to have facts for its foundation. Kant would have sided with Demokritos against Aristotle or any of the modern antagonists of realism. Experience is the essential basis of science; an Empyrismus, however, that does not become dogmatic, but only opposes the verbiage and arrogance of those who transcend the boundaries of reason,--ignore its limited faculties, boast of a knowledge of and insight into</page><page sequence="13">HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF IDEALISM AND REALISM. 129 the hidden working of forces, where real insight and know- ledge cease,-who eternally confound the practical and the theoretical, the material and the ideal, and wish to cut the thread of inquiry wherever and whenever it suits their particular interests. This arbitrary checking of the working of man s dynamic (intellectual) force of inquiry and progress is in our days not less at work than in the ancient classic times. To make man good and happy is the aim of both schools of philosophy. The question presents itself at once, whether idealism or realism can better attain this aim!. Demokritos tried to solve the question in restoring to man a cheerful quietism which he can only attain in becoming master of all his passions. Moderation, purity of heart, and a normal development of his intellectual capacities, are the duties of every individual. Neither hope nor fear is required to entice him to be good, for man has to make himself acquainted with his constitution, and to act in accordance with the requirements of his mechanical organization. This is, of course, a moral which omits every impulse of our intel- lectual nature; but after all, from a practical point of view, it is not very immoral, and preferable to an ethic inducing men to be good by the promise of reward or the assurance of punishment. Sicily and Lower Italy lived for centuries on the crumbs that fell from the intellectual feasts given at Athens, the central point of philosophy in ancient times. Goethe was right to have exclaimed, "America, thou art happier than the whole world, thou hast no castles in ruins, and no basalt." Freedom of thought not depending on obsolete traditions, a great distance from old places of culture, and the influence of ambitious priests, with their deeply rooted authority, have always acted beneficially on the transition period from blind faith to philosophical inquiry The Pythagorean school, though but a disguised Egyptian priesthood, acted most beneficially through the study of mathematics in promoting a more correct appreciation of the forces in nature. K 10</page><page sequence="14">130 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY. Xenophanes from Asia Minor, who settled in Italy, where he founded the Eleatic school, inquired into the Pythagorean philosophy, which propounded that everything was contained in the monad (the unity), and that everything was produced by it. Butwho made the Monad ? he asked, and found this proposi- tion too obscure, and argued thus :-"If anything has been made it has been made out of that which was, or out of that which was not; out of that which was not, it is impossible; for out of nothing, nothing can come. Out of that which was, it is impossible still, for since it already was, it could not have been made." He thus arrives at the impossibility of any timely creation by means of a monad, and assumes one sole Being- eternal, infinite, immutable-as the essence of all things. He found fault with Homer and Hesiod for having endowed the gods with human forms, voices, and manners. He objected already to the anthropomorphic conception of the gods, and acknowledged finite beings as simple modifications or forms of an infinite being, showing thus a strong leaning to pantheism. Xenophanes was an idealist, confining himself to an inquiry into things in themselves from a spiritualistic point of view. Heraklitos and Empedokles form a school of their own, and were neither idealists nor realists, but tried to combine in a spirit of eclecticism both elements. Heraklitos became, to a certain degree, a sceptic through the inconsistency of his pre- decessors, but wrapt his philosophy in a dangerous dogmatism. He was the founder of Greek Puritanism, and looked down upon this world as " a vale of tears," and received the title " the weeping philosopher." He set forth "'that the universal and divine reason was the criterion of truth ; that which was universally believed is certain, for it is borrowed from that common reason which is universal and divine." Such phrases are often heard in our times. The sun must then still move and the earth stand still, for it was once the universal and therefore divine belief of mankind. The Buddhistic religion, according to Heraklitos would be the truest, for it is more generally acknowledged than any other. He also propounded " that common reason is but the picture of the order of the</page><page sequence="15">HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF IDEALISM AND REALISM. 131 universe: whenever we derive anything from it, we possess truth; and if we interrogate only our own individual under- standing, we fall into error." I scarcely need draw your attention to the fact that this assumption served theologians, especially during the Middle Ages, as a means of extolling faith and degrading reason or intellect. It served to maintain universally accepted falsehoods as truths, because believed in by the ignorant masses, and to condemn in man the use of his faculty of inquiry as godless and diabolical. Heraklitos, how- ever, atoned by his death for his idealism ; he fell a sacrifice to his realistic researches in trying to explore the crater of Etna, which proves that he must not have been quite sure of his own philosophical principles, for if the general belief had been true, no exploration of the crater on his part would have been required ; the crater could not have been anything but the infernal regions of Hephaestos, where the thunderbolts of Zeus were forged by infernal spirits. Empedokles of Agrigentum belonged to the same school. With him matter and force were two separate entities. He was probably the first in Greece to reduce matter to the four primitive elements, air, fire, water,'and earth, held together by two fundamental forces, love and hatred, acting in nature as attraction and repulsion: his love and hatred did not work according to inherent laws, except the force of assimilation and separation. Organisms were, according to him, the inci- dental products of the fundamental forces. First, plants were formed, then animals. Nature brought forth the different or- gans singly; eyes without faces, arms without bodies, &amp;c. In the progressive development combinations took place, forming bodies at random of different shapes. Nature tries all possible combinations till it is able to produce a creature capable of propagating its genus. These are undoubtedly the germs of the Schelling-Oken and the Lamarck-Darwinian theory of descent. There is a difference in the two systems ; with Empedokles heterogeneous elements combine, while according to our modern philosophers the combinations are products of differential successions of</page><page sequence="16">132 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY. simple and homogeneous forms for an inherent purpose. The assertion of Empedokles was a mere hypothesis, while the doctrine of Darwin, based on a quantity of facts, has become a systematically proven theory. Both systems, however, account for the mechanical productions of form through un- limitedly repeated acts of generation and annihilation, and the survival of those that have in their accidental and relative construction the power of higher vitality. Whilst Demokri- tos, the realist, ruled through simplicity and straightforward- ness, Empedokles surrounded himself, through his tendency to idealism and his superior knowledge of the working forces of nature, with an aureole of miraculous and supernatural powers. Matter stands in the same relation to nature as conscious- ness to sensation. If we assume that consciousness is a possibility without sensation, we commit the same mistake as if we were to assume that the universe could exist without matter. Let us glance at the entire works of metaphysicians, or the propounders of different creeds, and we shall find that the most abstruse descriptions are mere reflections of imaginary or real sensations, because sensations serve in their relative harmony or discord to produce consciousness. The realist tries to deduce the various phenomena of nature from their material elements, while the sensualist deduces the whole of his consciousness from sensations. But sensations are only possible through outward impressions. The realist will attempt to become acquainted with the effects of outward nature; while the sensualist will deny the possibility of arriving at any certainty, as we have only impressions of which we become conscious: this consciousness is therefore at the same time the essence or reality of all things, beyond which we cannot go. It is said that Demokritos once met a porter in his native town, Abdera, who was heaping up pieces of wood with great ingenuity. He entered into a conversation with him, admired his cleverness in arguing, made him his pupil, and this porter</page><page sequence="17">HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF IDEALISM AND REALISM. 133 changed the position of philosophy in its relation to the development of humanity. The porter was Protagoras, the first teacher of philosophy for money, and the first sophist. He was followed by Hippias, Gorgias, Prodikos, and others. It became the fashion to listen to the teachings of these masters. Mr. Grote and Mr. Lewes in England, and Hegel in Germany, tried to save the honour, and to vindicate the position of the sophists in Greece. The sophists of this period of Greek philosophy stood in the same relation to real science as our metaphysicians now do. They advanced it to a certain degree, they paid more attention to the inner man, the subjective of their own natures, than to the objective phenomena of outer nature. The sophists were the first antagonists of realism and the founders of a subjective idealism which attained in Sokrates, Plato, and Aristotle the highest climax. The theory of Protagoras stands as a connecting link between the two extreme parties into which philosophy was already divided at this early stage of our historical development. Some cared only for the single, the individual, the detailed, the isolated facts ; others looked exclusively at the general. Protagoras united with his sensualism a kind of relativism that has been taken up in later years by Buchner and Moleschott in Germany. "The statement that something is, requires the verification of how and in what relation it is, else nothing is stated," says Protagoras. Buchner, in opposing the " thing in itself," asserts that " all things only exist so far as they have mutual relations, without which they mean nothing." Moleschott goes farther, and propounds that, ".without the eye into which the tree sends its rays, the tree does not exist." Realism had one great advantage, that it tried to tie down the human intellect to observation and experience. It early found the axioms. (a) That man, as such, is the essence of all things,-the living as far as they are, and the not living as far as they are not. (,3) That opposite assertions may be equally true. 10*</page><page sequence="18">134 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY. So soon as we assume that our consciousness is but the result of our sensation, things will assume a relative aspect, and what is heat to one man may be cold to another under the same temperature. This would be a negation of the phenomenal world as such. But is this so ? Sokrates already felt, that, besides mere impressions on our senses, there must be the impressions themselves. The phenomena must have an independent absolute reality, whatever the rela- tive impressions producing consciousness in us might be. The eternally same must be different from the eternally changing. Sokrates sought to find the solution; Plato was convinced that he had found it. The theory of relativism had a pernicious influence on the development of ethics; because if cold and heat were merely relative sensations, good and evil might also be so. What appeared to one virtue, might be vice to another. The same action that was condemned by A, might be rewarded by B. Where was a standard to come from ? Pleasure, according to Aristippus of Kyrene, was to be the standard of morals; according to Sokrates, virtue. Aristippus led to the extremes of realism, and Sokrates to the extremes of idealism. Practical realism produced an indo- mitable craving for material acquisitions and enjoyments, and was opposed very early by the theoretical realism of those who wished to reduce every phenomenon to its first elements ; and we may say without fear of contradiction that the realists of old, with their earnest endeavours to know the essence of things, have contributed far more to the happiness and the scientific progressive development of humanity than the dreamy idealists, who led to self-deception, spiritual conceit, and a refined immorality, productive of more harm than the realists ever had done. One great quality distinguished the realists, they always tried to direct man to the study of Nature and her phenomena, and therefore carried with them a certain amount of experimental ballast, which prevented them from flying into the regions of imagination, and losing their footing altogether as rational beings. The idealists, on the other</page><page sequence="19">HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF IDEALISM AND REALISM. 135 hand, who often began with the loftiest 0, priori ideas about God, the creation, the soul, virtue, duty, &amp;c., led in the course of time to the most realistic monstrosities through their dogmatic hypotheses, so soon as their assertions were thought more important than the intellect itself which had created their arbitrary systems. It so happened that of the two antagonistic parties, which brought body and mind, reality and ideality, into opposition, the realists kept within the boundaries of the possible, and thus did less mischief than the idealists, who pretended to know all about the unknowable, acting one-sidedly on man's mere emotional, ignorant, sensual part. Mystic hope and fear are both, when analyzed, but sensual excitements. To abstract man from mere matter, and to devote him to a kind of imaginary realism, was the doing of the idealists, who like the realists had their models among the Greeks. Knowledge and progress were never more efficaciously stopped for thousands of years than through this grand ideal movement in humanity. And yet it was but a natural development of our inborn forces. The consideration of the mere static elements in humanity was to give way to an exclusive consideration of what was dynamic in us. The conflict was Titanic, the more so, as it was the first conscious outburst of man's ideal power. Sokrates we have to thank for the phantoms of definitions, supposing an imaginary congruity between words and things. Plato followed with creating a deceptive method, trying to support one hypothesis with another more general one, and asserting that we may find in general and ideal abstractions alone the greatest realities. And to Aristotle we must ascribe the jugglery of possibilities and realizations, which led to his imaginary system of categories, through which he assumed to have exhausted all real knowledge. Sokrates considered virtue an entity, but we are as ignorant of the nature of this entity, even after having gone through all the dialogues of Plato, as we should be of the "philoso- pher's stone" after a careful study of the writings of the</page><page sequence="20">136 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY. alchemists. An ideal "something" was thus opposed to the utilitarian doctrine of the realists, who assumed virtue to consist in anything " useful to the state; " which led to Kant's exhaustive and practical moral dictate, "Act so, that the maxims of your actions may become the principles of general laws." Man is the essence of all things, as far as matter in his organization, and mind as the effect of this organization, are concerned. The individual man is in his transitory state the essence of isolated, detached phenomena; while humanity in the aggregate is the essence of the sum-total of these isolated phenomena. This would lead us on the path of induction from particulars to generals, in opposition to the Platonic assumptions that led humanity on the intricate by- ways of idealism to deduction, starting with general, often imaginary principles, and arriving at equally imaginary par- ticulars. To build up the world from an inner consciousness with a culpable neglect of reality, that is of matter, was the result of the working of the triad of ancient Greek philosophy. The importance of these teachings cannot be denied or ignored. Unconsciously they brought higher aims and aspirations into humanity. Sokrates was a man full of physical and intellectual power. He was stern, self-denying, and without wants. Courageous in battle, enduring and patient in suffering, a good table com- panion if required, otherwise abstemious and frugal. He be- came master of his passions, not because he was free from emo- tions and wild feelings, but because he practised the power of his intellect, and trained his great mind to subdue his mighty sensuality and violent temper. His thoughts and aims were few, but he concentrated the whole of his burning idealism on those few thoughts. He was earnest, and this earnestness gave extraordinary force to his speech. His was an apostolic and prophetic nature, and he tried to animate his hearers with the same glowing love that pervaded his spirit. Pro- gressive and revolutionary in his general views, Sokrates was still in his sentiments and notions decidedly relhgious and not</page><page sequence="21">HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF IDEALISM AND REALISM. 137 scientific. The teleological views of nature which he preached with a glowing fanaticism, often hiding his strong convictions behind a shield of irony, went to prove the existence and working of the gods, trying to satisfy a want in the tendency of all teleology to make the gods act and work like man. (See the dialogue with Aristodemus, Xenophon Mem., i., 4; or Lewes, vol. i., page 285, &amp;c.) That such a man with such principles should have been put to death will not astonish any student of history. No pliable mind, no smooth free- thinker, no cautious reformer was ever put to death, but the believing reformers were burnt and crucified. Those who felt the change in the intellectual development of humanity, and could not bring their feelings into conventional forms, fell as sacrifices to the periodical mental convulsions that threaten to undermine the general state of existing things. This was the case at the period of Sokrates. Priests and laymen felt it was necessary to give the gods of Greece a more spiritual and less anthropomorphic nature; but when Sokrates in spite of the approbation of the Delphic oracle, which said that "he was the wisest of mortals," openly proclaimed what every one dimly felt, priests and people were horrified, and accused him of atheism, though they believed less in the gods, in fact, were not even capable of understanding the lofty notion which Sokrates had formed of the God whom he was accused to have denied. The great principle of Sokrates was self-knowledge, not in a material, but exceptionally spiritual point of view. It is most interesting to trace in the struggle of these times how the material "monad," or atom of the realists, led to the spiritual " monotheos " of Sokrates. But was the one more intelligible than the other ? Sokrates tried in the spirit of modern times to free the gods of Greece of their coarser nature, and to reduce them to the mere embodiments of the forces of nature under one supreme deity. To secure this, deity from any taint of materialism, he opposed the study of nature as leading to no result, since the works of God as such were perfect and complete. The same opposition is still going</page><page sequence="22">138 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY. on in many quarters in our times against the physicists. "After all, what do they know ?" They certainly may not know what fire or oxygen is, but they at least try to know the effects of fire, instead of scanning the still more mysterious Creator of fire, of whom the idealists say the realists know nothing. By what means can we recognise the greater Cause without being able to make ourselves acquainted with the essence of so small an element as fire? What is God, if we are unable to know what oxygen is, though we handle it, separate it from other elements, trace its working and influence in the air, on plants, animals, and man ? The great advantage to be derived from the study of the history of the development of certain phases in humanity is to see how at all times, under all conditions, man tried principally to occupy himself with "what will least fit into his brain," as Goethe says. Of all the great masters of this branch of knowledge, Plato, the divine Plato, was the greatest. He was too much of a philosophical poet, and too little of a scientific philosopher, and was seized with a kind of supernatural mania. He worked out all the unintelligible passages of Sokrates, all his mental errors, and turned them methodically into so-called philosophical truths, that humanity has taken nearly two thousand years to shake off. Sokrates opposed realism because he was afraid to see humanity drifting into the merely sensual and material; but he did not altogether deny to man, with his higher aspirations, the possibility of being virtuous. With Plato philosophy was altogether removed from earth, and made something supernatural, settled, finished, like the inspiration of a prophet. Sokrates at least acknowledged some- times that he did not know; but Plato, like our modern theologians, never knew when he did not know, and was never more positive about his knowledge than when he knew least. Plato was the first who in science placed faith above knowledge; and still it was Plato who with his mighty spirit of idealism brought more than any other philosopher of antiquity, even than Aristotle, the realistic schools of our modern times into existence. Unconsciously some of our</page><page sequence="23">HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF IDEALISM AND REALISM. 139 greatest realists start like Plato with general assumptions, which they try by degrees, step by step, to prove by hard facts, turning thus ideal generalizations into systematically proven theories. It was Plato who, not contented with mere definitions and words, attempted to give us a clear notion of genus and species, and to subordinate, to co-ordinate, and to super-ordinate (or to superpose) our ideas. He created that hierarchy of thoughts in which the most general and least meaning was always placed highest. There can be no doubt that it was Plato who taught us first, that in order to attain knowledge abstract. generalizations are as indispensable as mere particular facts. The immortal mistake of Plato, and also of Aristotle, was that they allowed themselves to be satis- fied with mere words. The "logos " became omnipotent; the "logos" was the origin of all things ; the "logos" turned out to be God him- self, and man as the incarnation of the "logos" thought himself nothing less than a god. The "eidos" or " idea" was the element of which the word was the reality. The "eidos" is not visible, for everything visible is part of the mutable world of phenomena. The "eidos" has no need of space or time, for the supernatural cannot be confined to space and time. And yet can there be anything idealwithout some substratum of the real? Say the words pure, glorious, perfect, eternal, and form to yourself a notion of them that shall not affect the senses through matter in one essence or another ! It is impossible, and Plato found himself suddenly with all his lofty abstractions plunged in incomprehensible mysticism-the " sensual-supersensual," or the "realistic idealism,"-an idealism that was often coarser in its effects than the most realistic materialism. The "eidos " is existing above man, he becomes conscious of it through his inborn faculty, reason, which reason stands to the supernatural in the same relation as the senses to the sensual. Senses and mind were thus separated; this separation in itself was a mere assumption, and produced all those misunderstandings which furnish the most important facts in the intellectual develop-</page><page sequence="24">140 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY. ment of man's history. Our body, or the material in us, has no share in our knowledge or our spiritual life. Mind only is capable of understanding the "supernatural." Aristotle altogether separated "reason " from the organization of man as a separate entity. Pure intellect has its own " noumena," which in opposition to the "phenomena" form the objects of higher knowledge. But what were these "noumena ?" mere phantoms of the mind. What is our detached pure reason ? a mere myth. Man without his complicated organization has no " reason " at all, he can have no notions of a power which can only grasp the general, the abstract, the supernatural, or mere ideas without sensations and observations. In all the Platonic teachings the most important element is always the "unknown;" and all the grandiloquent systems that took their origin in the Platonic philosophy have served to retard the progress of humanity instead of advancing it. For Plato and Aristotle became for thousands of years scholastic incrus- tations, checking every freer flow of knowledge. On the other hand, Plato and Aristotle were necessary elements in the development of humanity. The dynamic force in humanity will never be contented with mere weights and measurements, or with so-called practical results, having mere dry and tangible facts for their basis. Our intellect will roam into the infinite, grasp the impossible, soar on the wings of speculation above mere matter, for we are justified in doing this. It is an inborn faculty, and as much our nature as the use of our limbs or the involuntary functions of our body. We must cultivate this faculty as carefully as the mere study of the multiplication table; for the striving to find union in the variety of phe- nomena, whether natural, spiritual, or historical, and the tracing of definite laws in the ever-changing incidents of nature and man's history, are the only means to vivify, to nourish and refresh the intellectual capacities of man if once in activity. They lead him to discoveries and furnish him with an ever- increasing amount of knowledge. As I intend to lay before you the further results of my studies on the development of these vital elements in the</page><page sequence="25">HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF IDEALISM AND REALISM. 141 history of mankind, in treating of the subject as it presented itself in Rome during the Middle Ages, and as it works in our modern times, I can be brief with regard to Aristotle, as I shall have an opportunity to refer to him more exhaustively in discussing scholasticism during the Middle Ages. He is said to have been the first physicist. SHe undoubtedly did something in that direction, but, like Sokrates and Plato, he was too dogmatic to be of real positive and not merely negative service to truth and progress. In conclusion, I want to draw your attention to the great mischief that was done in ancient and is done in modern times, more especially in the study of history, by separating philosophical principles from facts, and treating facts as isolated without due regard to their connection on general principles. This produces the same pernicious effect as the separation of natural science from sound philosophy. Our intellectual faculties are, to a certain degree, limited; who could be audacious enough to deny this ? but so are our faculties to weigh, to measure, to experiment, and to investi- gate. The philosophic historian has the same right to his lofty speculations as the physicist to his electric machines, the geologist to his pieces of stone, the botanist to his shrubs and blossoms, or the anatomist to his bones, sinews, and nerves. What are they all without the connecting mental power of the philosophic historian, who traces, not in isolated, but in combined facts, the slow and gradual growth of man's capacity to become a physicist. The partition wall that separated thinkers from mere mechanics or technical workers must at last fall. It can only be destroyed through a diligent study of history. Through history we become convinced that the theoretical thinker, the metaphysician, who grasps the ideal, is as necessary as the practical experimentist who pretends to deal only with matter, and that idealism and realism are not antagonistic, but completing elements in the progressive development of humanity. The physicist must arrive in his researches at certain points where he finds no answer to his</page><page sequence="26">142 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY. questions, where he deals, like Plato, with words. When we use such expressions as matter, force, vital energy, molecules, sentient, emotional, electricity, heat, motion, and mind, we use as many metaphysical notions as if we were to say in an algebraic or geometrical problem, a, b, c, or x, y, z. When the physicist is hard pressed and obliged to assert his power of mind over matter, he becomes at once the most determined metaphysician. The latest writings of one of our greatest physicists, (Dubois Reymond), try to bridge over the chasm between realism and idealism. Realists may talk of matter and force or motion as the origin of all things, but what is again the "fons mechanismi" that has produced matter, and endows it with motion and force ? what is mind itself, that under certain combinations becomes conscious of its own self, and of matter, and of force, acting according to certain inherent laws ? What is mind, showing itself in the systems of science, in the creations of art, in the mighty poetical revelations of the few chosen, if man be but a moving and moved accumulation of molecules, and nothing else,-in fact, a mechanical problem easily to be solved by a physicist ? Without idealistic speculation all our knowledge would be but a heap of unconnected rubbish. The 4apriori element of speculation is as necessary as the 4 posteriori result of research. The most important his- torical fact in the development of idealism and realism is un- doubtedly Darwin's theory. It is as influential as the astronomical discovery of Copernicus, the laws of Kepler or Newton's theory of gravitation. It has been attacked as gross realism, and still the very basis of Darwin's theory of descent is, as his greatest antagonist, Agassiz, has acknowledged, an ideal theory, a thought engendered 4 priori. Yes, Darwin's system is based on the purest efforts of our mental force, on philosophic speculation. Those idealists who express their horror at the tracing of law and casual connection in the phe- nomena of nature may rightly be compared to a poor hen that has hatched duck's eggs, and stands astonished at the temerity of the tiny ducklings that take to the water. Had</page><page sequence="27">HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF IDEALISM AND REALISM. 143 they studied Kant, whom they misunderstood, or Schoppen- hauer, of whom they know nothing, or Demokritos and Lucretius, whom they ignore, or Oken and Lamarck, whom they do not condescend to read, they would see in Darwin's theory the outgrowth, or, according to his theory, the natural development of his powers of intellectual selection. We strive now in all the different branches of knowledge consciously or even unconsciously, to follow Darwin's theory; not to isolate phenomena in nature, facts in history, words in languages, art-forms in aesthetics, diseases in medicine; for the more numerous the phenomena in nature, the more com- plicated the social conditions of man, the more puzzling the different languages in their apparently accidental formation, the more grotesque or beautiful the various forms in art, and the more mysterious the ravages of diseases, the more we require general principles in order to explain facts and phe- nomena, without being obliged to resort to mere chance, or any other unintelligible, arbitrary, and capricious first cause. The safest guide through the labyrinth of ideal and real phenomena is the study of history, and we shall see how Plato led to Lucretius and the Neo-Platonists, these to the realists and nominalists, these to Bacon, and Bacon to Newton, down to our own times, in which realism and idealism, specu- lation and experience, are trying to form the only possible united basis of our future scientific and historical progress.</page></plain_text>
