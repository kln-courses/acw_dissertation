<plain_text><page sequence="1">Guide to the Year's Work In Victorian Poetry: 1979 Richard Tobias General Materials The fashion this year is either sweeping generalization or very particular study. Michael Bright, Christopher Clausen, and Judith Weissman all speculate on the course of magic and mystery in Victorian poetry. G. B. Tennyson's analysis of Tractarian aesthetics, although seemingly narrow in its focus, is actually very relevant to these broad considerations as is George Landow's study of typology, a method of thought familiar then but lost to us. Mark Storey analyzes shifting uses of wit and humor from mid- eighteenth century to mid-nineteenth century. At an opposite extreme Carl Dawson in Victorian Noon looks only at the year 1850, Cynthia Behrman considers popular sea mythology, and Stephen Prickett focuses upon the Victorian writers of fantasy. I add a study that seems to be chiefly about Pater (William Buckler's essay on Marius) and an analysis of John Stuart Mill's philosophy, for both of these have implications for the larger study of Victorian poetry. Michael Bright in "English Literary Romanticism and the Oxford Movement" {JHI 40:385-404) describes Tractarianism as literary romanticism in ecclesiastical polity. As the poetic theory exalted the poet's role and the method of symbolism, the Oxford movement exalted the priest's role and emphasized symbols. Bright's melancholy conclusion is that while the poet as hero and the emphasis on symbols have disappeared from poetics, they still linger "almost unchanged, in the church." Bright would not include in the church born-again Christians who the pundits say dominate American life, but if Bright has powers of divination we may expect rood screens momentarily in American Episcopal churches. I would not be a bit surprised, as Dorothy Parker said long ago on another topic. Christopher Clausen's "Poetry as Revelation: A Nineteenth-Century Mirage" (GaR 33:89-107) says that nineteenth-century poetic theory exactly inverted Plato's judgment. (For another view of Plato's influence see Sara Moore Putzell's "Rights, Reason, and Redemption: Charlotte 241</page><page sequence="2">242/ VICTORIAN POETRY Bronte's Neo-Platonism," VN 55:5-7.) According to Clausen, whereas Plato sought reason, abstraction, and an end to myth and magic, nineteenth-century theorists had quite enough reason and abstraction, and they desired more myth and magic. Thus they lost their audience, for the audience preferred poetry to speak unequivocably on the truths and beauties of its civilization. On the positive side, this loss of audience liberated the poet to move freely in his world of will, magic, and myth. The first pages of Judith Weissman's "Vision, Madness, and Morality: Poetry and the Theory of the Bicameral Mind" (GaR 33: 1 18-148) should surprise and stimulate readers. She applies Julian Jaynes's The Origin of Consciousness and the Bicameral Mind to nineteenth-century British poetry "which can be seen as embodying a unique crisis in the bicameral poetic tradition." The Oxford Movement and Clausen's mirage-hunters should fit into such a scheme, but Weissman reads her poets in such a retrograde manner that the full implications of her argument do not emerge. Nevertheless the essay should encourage others who have a more inclusive view of the Victorians. She says of Robert Browning {contra N. Frye) that his poetry "may well be the least musical, least incantatory of the nineteenth century." She calls Browning "the most secure and least tormented Christian of the Romantic and Victorian poets" who accepted and "was contented with the revealed truths of the Anglican church." At the very least, the judgments are moot, and they interfere with possible applications of Jaynes's thought. Even with other strange readings of Arnold and Tennyson, the essay still suggests much about the grand design of Victorian poetry and its cultural role. G. B. Tennyson's "Tractarian Aesthetics: Analogy and Reserve in Keble and Newman" ( VN 55:8-10) is a very concentrated, very stimulating, and potentially very useful statement that makes me look forward to late nineteenth- and twentieth-century poetic theory. Of Tennyson's two qualities, analogy is roughly the same as symbol in Bright's essay above, but reserve means something like restraint, control, or even good manners (Tennyson never uses that last phrase). The quality of reserve saved Tractarians from the wild excesses that marred evangelical writing and left so much of it lying dead upon the strands of literary history. Reserve, it might also be said, is the genuine Platonic fear of mere magic and mere myth. Although Tennyson has been writing on this topic in other places in the last couple of years, this neat, tight statement has its virtues of clarity and force. George Landow's "Bruising the Serpent's Head: Typological Symbol in Victorian Poetry" {VN 55: 1 1-14) means by "type" roughly what these others mean by symbol, but Landow shows how this typology rose out of standard theological texts and sermons in high, middle, and low segments of the church. Landow's poetic examples are from Diana Mulock Craik,</page><page sequence="3">RICHARD TOBIAS / 243 Rossetti, Hopkins, and Browning; and like other essays reported here, Landow's chief aim is to alert other critics to a method of communication that we have forgotten. Since typology is not Plato's approved method, Landow's essay adds further evidence of the Dionysian, bicameral, irrational forces that Victorian poetry longed to control with something like Tractarian reserve (or plain twentieth-century hard-edged aesthetics). Along with these five, I would recommend Mark Storey's Poetry and Humor from Cowper to Clough, an analysis of the shift from eighteenth- century wit and reason to nineteenth-century humor and feeling. Storey begins with Blake and Wordsworth (he urges us to think again about the possibility of humor in Wordsworth), Cowper and Keats (strange conjunction), Byron, and finally Tennyson and Clough. He contrasts Tennyson's Princess with Clough's Bothie to show Clough's mastery of subject and tone. Although it is momentarily difficult to imagine Clough's sharing even that much with the Oxford Movement, Clough's humor achieves the equivalent result of Tractarian reserve. With humor and feeling, Clough managed his monsters of myth and magic that so befuddled poor Tennyson's mind at odd intervals. Storey writes about his cultural shift with ingenue-like innocence of recent battles to define what happened in the same historical period he considers. Still, his view has freshness to recommend it; his angle differs to make us see more wit, paradox, ambiguity, complication, and control than we have thought evident or praiseworthy in the Victorian imagination. 2 William E. Buckler's fine essay "Deja vu Inverted: The Imminent Future in Walter Pater's Marius the Epicurean" (VN 55: 1-4) justifies Pater's novel, but it also uses the novel to illuminate the whole period. Buckler shows how Pater's history creates history and how the novel demonstrates "the enormous shift in literary strategy" that occurred between Carlyle and Pater. Pater's phrase about the "unction and mysticity of spirit" explains and comments on the studies cited above about the magic and mystery crying to escape. Since Pater states his "firm belief in the organic regeneration of men and their cultures," his book illuminates the period and creates its own history. Pater is thus more clearly understood as the key figure between Victorian and Modern. Off on quite more modest tacks, however, are Cynthia Behrman's Victorian Myths of the Sea, Carl Dawson's Victorian Noon, and Stephen Prickett's Victorian Fantasy. Cynthia Fansler Behrman's Victorian Myths of the Sea (1977) describes the evolution of popular belief, and since the Victorians wrote so much sea poetry (clearly she is surprised), she believes that the poetry significantly shaped the myth-making and myth-reflecting</page><page sequence="4">244/ VICTORIAN POETRY of the time. Behrman describes the area of thought that so terrified Plato, and she admits that historian friends doubted the propriety of her attempt to make reasonable description and analysis of popular myth. She seemed, to them, to be seeking literal fish in a sea of mystery and imagination. What could the factory worker think, she asks, in a grim midlands town about the sea as he was instructed by popular press, schools, preachers, and politicans? She has consulted popular anthologies, magazines, memoirs, and even children's books. The book should entertain Victorianists, and it will also aid in that impossible task of re-imagining the audience for nineteenth-century poems. She says, for example, that the Victorians identified with Greek sea power; how then would they understand Arnold's Tyrian trader metaphor at the end of "The Scholar-Gipsy"? Or Clough's sea metaphors? Although Carl Dawson calls his book Victorian Noon: English Literature in 1850, his writers speak more often of the time as the "summer dawn." I can't imagine a book titled Victorian 8:42 A.M. His 1850 is eventful: the Consort was finishing plans for the 1851 Exhibition; Peel died; Wordsworth died and his widow published The Prelude', Pius IX established the Roman hierarchy in Britain again; in that year began the great economic boom that lasted until 1873. It was also the year of In Memoriam and David Copperfield, two books which profit by comparison to Wordsworth's Prelude. George Henry Lewes is very evident in Dawson's discussion. Francis Newman is more central than his brother John Henry, but the Francis in 1850 prepares us for the figure that John Henry Newman will occupy in the next decade. We see Charles Kingsley writing both Yeast and Alton Locke. Dawson's limitation to the year 1850 means that he has nothing about Darwin, Meredith, Trollope, George Eliot, Hopkins, Morris, Swinburne, Pater, Stevenson, Hardy, Lewis Carroll, Leslie Stephen, Walter Bagehot, Frederic Harrison, and a host of other figures from the second half of the century. The year is, however, sufficiently striking and significant for Dawson's anti-history to interest a reader, and there is the fascinating motif of autobiography in so many of his sources. Dawson, like Keats, avoids designs on his reader's mind. He simply presents his books, his men and women, and the currents flowing in his memorable year. As a result, the book is slightly harder to read and enjoy than G.M. Young's books. Young wanted to shape his reader's mind; Dawson hopes the reader can discover his or her own history. Stephen Prickett's Victorian Fantasy is an odd book that, at first glance, doesn't belong since he is interested most infictionists from Horace Walpole to Edith Nesbit and Rudyard Kipling. Actually Prickett shows how the concept of imagination wandered out of early nineteenth-century poetry and moved into fantasy. Exuberance, not repression, is the central fulfillment in Victorian fantasy, and he has examples in Thackeray, Hood,</page><page sequence="5">RICHARD TOBIAS / 245 Christina Rossetti, and even Aubrey Beardsley's version of the Venus- Tannhauser myth, "Under the Hill." To Prickett, the poetic element is "the desire always for something more," and since this desire could not be contained in conventional nineteenth-century realism nor in nineteenth- century high poetry, the fantasists moved in to exploit abandoned territory. Prickett approaches his subject and changes conventional understanding just as bright moonlight changes a familiar landscape (the same could be said about Mark Storey's Wit and Humour). Prickett's earlier study of the influence of Romanticism on the Victorian churches is getting more and more application, but he seems not to know much about German romanticism nor about the definitions of romanticism attempted in the last thirty or forty years. He simply reads his texts with his sensibilities open and alert. We may see more as a result. For example, he believes that the average reader must have been dazzled by discoveries of beasts, habits, and discordant behaviors; thus the daily world prepared readers for the odd insights of fantasy writers like C. Rossetti, Lear, and Carroll. The fantasy writers had an audience and in some few cases they have either kept the audience - although the children's literature people seem to think that George MacDonald is lost on twentieth-century children - or else they have influenced persons like Tolkein, Lewis, and science fictionists who gained an audience that the poets once had. Prickett's book may also be supplemented by George Landow's "And the World Became Strange: Realms of Literary Fantasy" (GaR 33:7-42), but Landow, in this outing, is entirely concerned with prose works by Ruskin, MacDonald, Meredith, and Morris, and he seeks to connect these fantasy writers to British illustrators and designers. Still, his thought also reflects back onto the poetry, its audience, its demise, and the culture which produced it. I close with another study on a particular figure - in this case John Stuart Mill - but a study which seems to me to have broader and more thorough interest in the whole period than simply the way that Mill's mind worked when he thought about poetry; the essay is Jonathan Loesberg's "In Which a Poet is Frightened by a Lion: The Philosophical Context of Mill's Poetic Theory" (VN 55: 26-31). Loesberg explains how Mill's justification of poetry occurred in his essays of the 1830's, but since Mill's mind differs from the rest of the century only in its superiority, Loesberg's attempt explicates more than Mill's effort to define self-consciousness. Loesberg cites Mill's review of Tennyson's 1830 and 1832 book of poems; one can hardly imagine Tennyson being willing to listen to a Benthamite reviewer, but much of what Mill said became Tennysonian practice. Like Pater's novel, Mill is the history of his time becoming history, and he is a voice we must attend to.</page><page sequence="6">246/ VICTORIAN POETRY The world shifts but slightly because of these studies of its diurnal course, but both grand views and particular views of its projects unseal the slumbering spirit. Otherwise we would all relapse into the familiar of Judith Weissman's understanding. Re-awakening discloses neither new monsters nor transformed benignity, but the patterns of cultural shift become brighter and richer in their complexity. David De Laura's "Nature Naturing: Literary Natural History" (VS 22: 193-202) is actually a long review article of the Knoepflmacher and Tennyson Nature and the Victorian Imagination of 1977, but De Laura's essay deserves inclusion here because DeLaura clearly intends to counter some directions of present thought and to set new thoughts going. He complains, for example, that the contributors to the volume seem to have insufficient knowledge of the Romantics. His complaint that we insufficiently use new critical tools, I would also echo. The Platonic ideal is always eluding us. Still, Tennyson, Bright, and Landow have much to show about Tractarian fomentation; Dawson has insight into the autobiographical year of 1850; Buckler on Pater contributes to the richness and complexity of an evolving culture. Each enables metaphorical rocks and stones to signify again. Matthew Arnold Jerold J. Savory The "multitudinousness" of the man himself, to borrow his own word, seems to have been the theme of this year's publishing on Matthew Arnold. Books and articles deal with Arnold as poet, controversial essayist and literary critic, prophetic theologian, student, humanist, educator, and school inspector. Arnold the poet is well represented in the year's most important book, Miriam Allott's new edition of her late husband Kenneth's The Poems of Matthew Arnold (19 '65) in the Longman Annotated English Poets series. This second edition of what has become a standard text for scholars and students thoroughly revises and expands the original, adds a new preface summarizing the revisions and additions, and includes five new appendices. Especially helpful are additional annotations referring to Super's edition of Complete Prose Works, Dawson's Critical Heritage collection of early articles on Arnold's poetry, and numerous notes made</page><page sequence="7">JEROLD J. SAVORY / 247 by Kenneth Allott, especially on the longer poems. Among the new poems are a Tennysonian pastiche of 1865, an impromptu, "Little baby Howeis" from the early 1870's, several previously unpublished youthful poems, and a few interesting lines of verse written in the mid-1870's. English translations are now provided for the many quotations in the commentary from various Latin, Greek, and modern European sources. Several biographical additions have been made to the chronological table of Arnold's life and works, and the new appendices include chronological orde rings of the major poems and the complete text of Arnold's "Preface to Merope." Fifteen years ago, Kenneth Allott regretted that his pioneering volume in the Longman's series could not be brought out in paperback; the $4.50 cost of the hardbound copy seemed high. We now have that paperback - at $19.95! Despite inflation, Arnold: The Complete Poems is worth the price. What Richard Tobias wrote in his review of the original edition still stands. He said that the book belongs in any reasonable library of Victorian literature, and it is worthy to stand beside Super's Prose Works and the Tinker and Lowry edition. Arnold is plain before us as he has never been plain before. The edition is a great service to scholars and to any student who knows that Arnold belongs in our consciousness. (VP 5 [1967]: 77) The most important critical essay on Arnold's poetry this year is Barbara Fass Leavy's "Iseult of Brittany: A New Interpretation of Matthew Arnold's Tristram and Iseult" (VP 18: 1-22). Arnold scholars have been puzzled about how the Merlin and Vivian story of Part III of the poem relates to the rest of the poem. The tale, argues Leavy, depicts the fantasy life of Tristram's wife, Iseult of Brittany, who projects herself into the role of Vivian, her symbolic rival. Leavy cites Villemarque's description of the Brittany forest and the frustrated maternal instincts of its Druidesses (e.g. Vivian) as evidence that Vivian and the Breton Iseult provide the combined voices of "the complete woman Victorian England would not tolerate." Leavy's most significant insight is into Arnold's possible awareness of woman's repressed fantasies and the female psyche. An interesting dialogue might develop if Helen Marie Loeb would respond to Leavy. Loeb's 1979 University of Wisconsin dissertation, "Cinderella Displaced and Replaced: Mythic Displacement in Tristram and Iseult,' Jane Eyre, Tess of the D'Urbervilles and Turn of the Screw"' concludes that Arnold's Tristram chooses death by choosing the Irish Iseult. Arnold as controversial essayist and literary critic is the focus of Carl Dawson and John Pfordresher in their Matthew Arnold: Prose Writings. The Critical Heritage. The editors have provided, in photo-ready typescript, some sixty reviews of Arnold's prose appearing in various journals from 1861 to 1896. In a substantial introduction, they point out what Sidney Coulling in Matthew Arnold and His Critics (1974) has already shown - how Arnold's controversial statements prompted</page><page sequence="8">248/ VICTORIAN POETRY controversial responses from the periodicals and how these, in turn, directed or redirected the evolution of Arnold's thought and style. However, the primary purpose of the editors' book is to provide a sampling from the "wide variety" of actual texts from the nineteenth-century journals. Herein lies both the strength and weakness of the volume. It is useful to have ready access to several dozen of the original magazine articles (some of which have been cut, with headnotes accounting for the deletions), and the editors should be commended for their selection, which includes both praise and blame for Arnold's work. Approximately one- fifth of the collection deals with Arnold's religious writings of the 1870's, a welcomed addition for those who recognize the importance of this period. However, accepting the necessary limitation of selectivity in reproducing the articles, the compilers might have given more attention to bibliography and index, neither of which is as helpful as it might have been. Dawson's companion volume on Arnold's poetry provides over 300 entries of periodical articles on the poems. Why no comparable checklist in this volume? The coherence between Arnold the poet and Arnold the literary critic is argued by Ann Marie Ross in "Matthew Arnold's Elegiac Essays: The Death and Fame of the Poet of Nature" (SIR 18:49-68). In an analysis of thematic and critical interrelations between Arnold's elegies on poets (Heine and Senancour) and his elegiac essays (Heine, the Guerins, and Keats), Ross demonstrates that "the elegiac vision lies at the heart of Arnold's career as both poet and prose writer, as artist and as critic." Arnold as religious thinker fares well in Nathan A. Scott, Jr., "Arnold's Version of Transcendence - The Via PoeticcT (Journal of Religion 59: 261-284). Scott ranks Arnold as "the most truly prophetic figure" in a Victorian trio also including Newman and Maurice. He finds Arnold "in that tradition reaching from Vico to Heidegger which says in effect that it is the office of the poet to name the Holy," not to provide a new religion of poetry but to provide the language of poetic imagination through which the Holy may be expressed. While Scott acknowledges Arnold's shortcomings as a systematic theologian, he sees him as "one of the most creative strategists of religious reflection in the modern period," anticipating the kind of empirical theology associated with such thinkers as Henry Nelson Wieman and Bernard Meland, Charles Hartshorne and Schubert Ogden. Another articulate interpreter of Arnold's religious position, James C. Livingston, provides "A Note from Matthew Arnold to Wilfrid Ward: The Quadrangular Duel'" (Arnoldian 6,ii: 15-19) in which Arnold expresses thanks for Ward's The Clothes of Religion. The note prompts Livingston's clarification of the issues in an 1884 dispute among Ward, Herbert Spencer, Frederic Harrison, and James Fitzjames Stephen on the prospects of religion in the future. While Arnold sides with Ward</page><page sequence="9">JEROLD J. SAVORY / 249 against the other three, his own position is really a fifth alternative, a Catholic Modernism similar to that of George Tyrrell. Arnold as student and Arnold as educator are the subjects of several publications. Patrick J. McCarthy became a "Strayed Sightseer" (to borrow the title of an 1855 parody of Arnold's "The Strayed Reveller") in a pilgrimage to "Matthew Arnold's Laleham" {Amoldian 6, iii: 4-10), the village of Arnold's birth, early schooling, and burial, where the local secondary school still bears his name. Arnold's life as a "less than dutiful" Oxford student who was given a "less than satisfactory" training in the 1840's is described by Warren Anderson, who provides new information about Arnold's Balliol studies in "Arnold's Undergraduate Syllabus" {Amoldian 6, ii: 2-6). James Simpson, in his revised doctoral dissertation, Matthew Arnold and Goethe (Modern Humanities Research Association: London), traces Arnold as a student of Goethe in a thorough and clear study ranging from Arnold's Oxford days in the 1840's to his period of religious writings of the 1870's. Cautious about calling his book an "influence study," Simpson emphasizes Arnold's relationship to Goethe as a "shifting and complex affair." Goethe served as a model of poetic adequacy to correct Arnold's view of mid-century feverish romanticism, offered an avenue to Spinoza, and informed Arnold's ideal of simplicity, severity, and plainness in critical style. Even in his religious writings, Arnold relies upon Goethe's stress on ethics while expressing less enthusiasm for the Sage of Weimar than he had shown in earlier days. Arnold's career as a school inspector is given substantial treatment by David Hopkinson in a two-part illustrated article in History Today (29 [January]: 29-37 and [February]: 98-105). In the commentary, sprinkled with interesting photographs and drawings from popular periodicals and elsewhere, Hopkinson provides a well-written reminder of the persons and events involved in Arnold's thirty-five-year effort to "humanize pupils and weaken the prejudices of nation and class." One interesting feature of the article is a brief section on Arnold's relationship to Anthony John Mundella, the education reformer in Gladstone's government of the 1880's. William Leigh Godshalk reminds us of yet another important friendship between educators in "An Unrecorded Letter from Matthew Arnold to William Parsons Atkinson" (N&amp;Q 17:124-127), one of the founding faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Several miscellaneous items and shorter notes on Arnold deserve brief mention. Michael Fischer (SHR 13, ii: 87-99) finds Arnold's defense of the "humanizing" role of literature as one needing revision now that literature and the other arts have become deceptively prominent American pastimes, like tennis and tourism. Fischer's argument is muddled, but his point is worth the effort of reading. Vinod Sena, in "W. B. Yeats, Matthew Arnold, and the Critical Imperative" ( VN56: 10-14), argues that Yeats's prolonged</page><page sequence="10">250 / VICTORIAN POETRY quarrel with Arnold proved to be one of "terminology, not substance." Lastly, The Arnoldian continues to provide Arnold scholars with useful material, even though the journal has expanded its scope to include other Victorian issues. The Fall, 1979, issue, for example, contains Edward A. Watson's interesting "Matthew Arnold's 'The Study of Poetry' in the Context of T.H. Ward's The English Poets'' in which the author argues that "the touchstones are a means to an end: the demonstration of the obliteration of distinctions between excellent and inferior." The same issue contains Fraser Neiman's "A Note on Arnold Scholarship" which annotates some forty publications on Arnold during 1978-79 and discusses two worthwhile volumes containing chapters or sections on Arnold: Carl Dawson's Victorian Noon: English Literature in 1850 and Geoffrey Tillotson's A View of Victorian Literature. The Winter, 1980, issue of The Arnoldian is strictly for those whose appreciation of Arnold allows for amusing critique and parody. Guest editors Jerold J. Savory and Patricia Marks have gathered some caricatures, cartoons, and comic commentaries on the life and works of Arnold in "A Charivari to Matthew Arnold," drawing from such British comic periodicals as Punch, Fun, and Vanity Fair and from the American journals Life, Puck, and The Judge. Robert Browning Thomas J. Collins Browning studies published during 1979 reflect a wide range of interests, including materials on biography, textual problems, and the interpretive. In the last category, although the coverage of the canon is not extensive, the essays exhibit a number of quite varied approaches, some which are enlightening and others which are, to this admittedly conservative reader, downright baffling. The following presents a fair sampling of these offerings. William S. Peterson, a prolific and talented Browning scholar, has contributed an important biographical work with his Browning's Trumpeter: The Correspondence of Robert Browning and Frederick J. Furnivall, 1872-1889. This edition is a convenient companion volume to Peterson's fine History of the London Browning Society, published a</page><page sequence="11">THOMAS J. COLLINS / 251 decade ago. It is valuable, as well, as an example of the truly cumulative nature of scholarship, since it is a natural by-product of the previous work. As such, it might provide a useful bit of instruction to those among our number who seem to believe, or, to be more exact, who have been taught to believe, that they need not distinguish between scholarship and self- indulgent assertion. More of that later. Browning's Trumpeter contains 168 letters in its main sequence, with 148 from Browning to Furnivall, 14 from Furnivall to Browning, and 6 others by various correspondents. There is, in addition, one Appendix which gives a narrative account, in the form of 23 letters, of a quarrel within FurnivalPs New Shakespeare Society in which Browning became involved, and another which reprints two articles by Furnivall on Browning. 120 of these letters are either previously unpublished or have been published only in part. Peterson assists the reader considerably with his editorial "Preface," his "Introduction," and his meticulous presentation of the texts of the letters accompanied by detailed and copious annotation. FurnivalFs relationship with Browning was, as the editor explains, always fraught with tension. The energetic and opinionated man of letters was bristling with unacceptable suggestions which he communicated to Browning with persistent regularity: Browning should write a poem on Victorian life, preferably on the dishonesty of Disraeli; he should reveal more of himself in his poetry, and he should persuade Smith, Browning's publisher, to issue a Shilling Selection of his works. But the letters also reveal that there was genuine respect and affection between the two men. Despite Furnivall's truly idiosyncratic behavior, his devotion to Browning and his poetry, evidenced especially through his foundation of the London Browning Society, could not but elicit Browning's grateful, though tactful, friendship. Two articles in Volume 7 of Browning Institute Studies (also edited by Peterson) treat further aspects of the mature poet's life, each drawing upon previously unpublished material: Michael Meredith's "Browning and the Prince of Publishers" (pp. 1 -20) and Robert Secor's "Robert Browning and the Hunts of South Kensington" (pp. 1 15-136). Meredith, who has gained access to ledgers and correspondence in the possession of John Murray, examines the history of Browning's twenty-two year publishing relationship, begun in 1867, with the firm of George Murray Smith. The details about such matters as financial arrangements are augmented by a discussion of Smith's active role as Browning's friend and publicist; in addition, Meredith describes the poet's relationship with Smith in the 1840's, and explains why he initially chose as publisher and later abandoned Chapman and Hall. Robert Secor's essay is based on the letters and unpublished papers of Margaret and Violet Hunt (mother and daughter, 1831-1912 and 1862-1942), which record the family's relations</page><page sequence="12">252/ VICTORIAN POETRY and conversations with Browning from the 1860's until his death in 1889. Margaret and her husband, Alfred Hunt (1830-96), entertained a circle of notable Victorian figures, including Ruskin, Ford Madox Brown, and Holman Hunt. We receive some new first-hand accounts of Browning's conversation, his difficulties with publishers, and his attitudes toward some of his contemporaries. These three biographically related works give us a multi-faceted perspective on Browning's mature years, and each demonstrates careful scholarship. This abundance of primary material suggests that there is more to come - the full publication, for example, of Browning's correspondence with Smith, Elder. Let us hope that any new discoveries will be handled as skillfully as these. Allen C. Dooley's "Browning's Poetical Works of 1888-1889" (SBHC 7:43-69) discusses Browning's text. Since the 1888-89 edition was the last one seen through the press by the poet himself, making it especially important for editorial purposes, knowledge about it is indispensable. Information is provided about exactly how the edition was produced, what its various forms were, and how those forms can be identified. Dooley provides material, derived from his examination of multiple copies of the first and second impressions of the edition on a Hinman Collator, which makes it possible to pinpoint corrections, plate wear, and print disintegration in the edition's printing history. Part of his purpose in this analysis is to enable readers to identify and preserve varieties of the edition, which survive in great numbers. Using his data relating to title-page dates, the presence or absence of corrections, the kinds of advertisements (when they are present), and the signs of plate decay, one should be able to identify editions easily enough. The essay is useful, but it does contain some contentious elements. Dooley is either closely associated with, or is perhaps one of, the new group working on the Ohio-Baylor Browning. He does not say this, but the evidence in his essay is convincing: generous references in the text to those associated with that edition, and dismissive footnotes which attempt, with a mere sentence, to discredit the work of others. We learn, for example, that the Peterson-Kelley "Final Revisions" list (in BIS, 1973) is incomplete and contains several errors of interpretation, and that John Pettigrew's unfavorable review of the Ohio was based on a faulty second impression. Evidence would be helpful, but it would not make the Ohio venture any more credible. Nor do the congratulatory remarks about one of the Ohio- Baylor editors who has "discovered" a copy of Red Cotton Night-Cap Country with corrections in Browning's hand in the Berg Collection, and who has "identified" several stages of proof of that same poem. Discoveries, perhaps, for these editors, but not for others who have worked with Browning's text. Finally, this essay seems to imply that, while the</page><page sequence="13">THOMAS J. COLLINS / 253 second impression, especially in its later stages, is corrupt, the first impression of 1888-89 (given Browning's corrections for the second) is trustworthy. Such is not the case. My copy of the first impression (confirmed as a first using Dooley's criteria) contains numerous imperfections, particularly in punctuation, which would not be evident on a Hinman Collator, and which, judging from the Dykes-Campbell volumes and the Brown University lists, Browning himself missed in his own process of correction. In Volume 5, for example, at page 253, end of line 20 (Christmas- Eve), a point appears so partially that it could easily be ignored by a printer using this impression as a copy-text. Despite the value of Dooley's work, problems remain in the determination of a reliable text for Browning's poetry. The only substantial critical essay published last year on the early poetry was "Browning's Paracelsus: 'A Poem, Not a Drama'" (Genre 12:203-218), by Clyde de L. Ryals. Ignoring Browning's prefatory warning that the work is not a drama, several critics have judged it as one and have found it deficient. Ryals sees the poem as an important milestone in Browning's search for adequate form, and sets himself the task of determining its literary kind more precisely and judging its success or failure from that perspective. The author examines several related matters in the course of this generic consideration: the carefully counterpointed structure of the poem, the dialectic working out of theme, and the major concern in the poem with the relationship of language to truth. These aspects of Ryals' discussion are revealing, although they do to some degree overlap with areas considered by previous critics. But most original and of most interest is his identification of Paracelsus in its historical generic context, specifically the early nineteenth-century theory and practice of a literature of dramatic "moments." The impetus provided by this developing form, coupled with certain of Browning's preoccupations at the time, led to Paracelsus: "The result - a series of dramatic fragments or moments organized around the life of one person and presented discontinuously - would be a new genre permitting the poet to achieve what other poets and critics had been proclaiming as an ideal during the first third of the nineteenth century: a narrative which was both lyric and dramatic" (p. 208). Ryals concludes, convincingly, that judged on this basis Paracelsus is successful. Susan Hardy Aiken has done some diligent work on one of the "most persistent little mysteries" in Browning studies and has written a short article, "*Hy, Zy, Hine' and Browning's Medieval Sources for 'Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister'" (VP 17:377-383), which proposes a viable solution. The "mystery" relates to the source of this incantation which can both explain the words and illuminate the larger context of the poem. She contends that previous studies by James F. Loucks and Gordon Pitts have</page><page sequence="14">254/ VICTORIAN POETRY suggested likely possibilities, but that her research has yielded evidence that extends and confirms Pitts's argument concerning the medieval liturgical parody, the Mass of the Ass. Aiken effectively dispenses with Loucks's position, and provides a sufficiently cogent case, in confirmation of Pitts's explanation, that this small but vexing problem might, for a time at least, be settled. Such are the rewards of thoughtful scholarship combined with critical acumen. While line 70 of Browning's "Soliloquy" has elicited extensive debate, "In a Balcony" has been relatively neglected. In "Theatricality in Browning's 'In a Balcony'" (BSN 9,i: 10-14), Ross Posnock begins to remedy the deficiency. Posnock proposes that the stature of the play resides in its subtle examination of a theatricalized view of the self and reality. Posnock sees Constance, not Norbert, as the main character in the work, and he focuses on her complex, manipulative behavior as its explanatory center. His discussion of the intricacies of the progression of the play develops out of his awareness of the role-playing and directorial talents of the heroine which, finally, lead to her defeat. She is a fine actress and a good director, but her misreading of the Queen's character leads to the possibility of her eventual punishment and even death. Posnock engages in questionable biographical speculations a la Betty Miller, but his comments on the behavior and function of Constance and the progression of the work to near resolution deserve attention. Three major articles, as well as Aiken's brief essay, appeared in the winter issue of Victorian Poetry. William Gruber's "Temporal Perspectives in Robert Browning's A Death in the Desert" (pp. 329-342) is a rewarding but knotty article - and quite appropriately, since A Death is one of Browning's most difficult short pieces. Gruber builds upon the work of E. S. Shaffer in "Kubla Khan" and the Fall of Jerusalem, which demonstrates that in the poem Browning not only accepts the main factual contentions of the higher critics, but follows their methodology to construct his poem; in addition, St. John is intended less as a particular person than as general human point of view. However, as Gruber explains, the dramatic monologue usually works to personalize its speaker, since the form assumes the validity of individual perspective at the same time that it reveals the particularity of such a perspective. It is the reconciliation of this dichotomy between what the poem accomplishes and what the monologue form usually allows with which the author concerns himself, primarily through an extended analysis of Browning's use in the poem of a complex structuring of temporal perspectives. This is an original and rewarding essay. In "Pompilia: 'Saint and Martyr Both'" (pp. 287-301), Kay Austen draws attention to the character in The Ring and the Book whom others have usually treated as ancillary and who has received, consequently,</page><page sequence="15">THOMAS J. COLLINS / 255 relatively little attention. Austen believes that this has resulted from a reluctance of critics to confront the religious content of the poem, a disproportionate emphasis on Caponsacchi and the issue of truth and, finally, a persistent view of Pompilia as simple and ignorant. Pompilia, Austen suggests, is neither simple nor ignorant; she exhibits, on the contrary, a profound understanding of herself, of the meaning of her life, of Guido, and of God. She is the central character of the poem and it is through her character that the stated goals of The Ring and the Book, to show God's truth and save the soul, are fulfilled. In his depiction of Pompilia's intensely human and agonizing struggle toward goodness, "Browning revives the psychomachia of the mystery and morality plays. As his central character in the struggle between virtue and vice for the souls of men and women, he creates Pompilia, a Christian saint" (p. 290). One might want to argue with Austen's position on Pompilia's essential centrality, but there is no question that her essay serves to counteract the rather unbalanced view of Pompilia's character and function articulated by previous critics. Correctives are always welcome in Browning criticism, especially when expressed in such lucid prose. For the last part of this review we turn to a number of papers which employ somewhat more innovative critical approaches than those dealt with thus far. A final essay from the same issue of Victorian Poetry, "Facts and Figures: Browning's Red Cotton Night-Cap Country" (pp. 343-363), by Walter M. Kendrick, is deconstructionist in critical orientation. The approach is handled by Kendrick in an adroit and sensible manner. I had begun to wonder during the past few years, as I attempted to grapple with the pontifications of some North American deconstructors, if this approach could ever be used sensibly in the reading of texts. Kendrick demonstrates that it can be. He believes that all of Browning's later narrative works are interrogative or deconstructive poems which set out to question the fundamental components of the poet's craft. Red Cotton, in particular, "is a detailed critique of the assumption that any event, whether it be a work of art or a leap from a tower, obtains its meaning from the inferred 'character' of its agent. Indeed, the poem goes far towards undoing the assumed connection between character and deed, between writer and written, even between the things of the world and the narratives which claim to be 'about' them" (p. 353). This is an illuminating essay. It demonstrates not only that its author can read perceptively but also that he has an acute awareness of both critical and cultural context. Such an awareness is, indeed, typical of all the work surveyed thus far in this review. It is, unfortunately, singularly lacking in a number of papers contained in Robert Browning: A Collection of Critical Essays (Prentice- Hall Twentieth Century Views), edited by Harold Bloom and Adrienne Munich. Before turning to specifics I should note that this collection is a</page><page sequence="16">256 / VICTORIAN POETRY rather curious mix. It contains five essays which have been published previously and, with a single exception (John Hollander's "Robert Browning: The Music of Music," pp. 100-122), which are readily accessible elsewhere: George Ridenour's "Four Modes in the Poetry of Robert Browning" (pp. 13-27) is an introduction to a Browning anthology; John Killham's "Browning's 'Modernity'" (pp. 79-99) is from another collection of essays; Robert Langbaum's "Browning and the Question of Myth" (pp. 148-166) is from PMLA, and has already been reprinted elsewhere; finally, Bloom reprints Bloom on Browning from his Poetry and Repression, published only four years ago. A unique contribution, a reprint of a poem entitled "November, 1889" (pp. 188-200), by Richard Howard, with a dedication "For Harold Bloom," is a downright silly rendition of deathbed Browning. In terms of original contributions, there are four essays and Bloom's "Introduction." I would recommend that readers look at an essay by Loy D. Martin, "The Inside of Time" (pp. 59-78), which offers a linguistic approach to the monologue form and some interesting remarks on "My Last Duchess." The remaining pieces suffer from an extreme "anxiety of influence" - that of Harold Bloom. Least affected, although clearly in discipleship, is Adrienne Munich in "Troops of Shadows: Browning's Types" (pp. 167-187). She discusses Pauline and the "Prologue" and "Epilogue" to the Parleyings in order to demonstrate the traditions of figural representation upon which Browning drew in organizing his poetry in terms of types. The essay is not highly original. The two remaining articles, and Bloom's "Introduction," are obsessed with the "precursor" problem, and also with proposing readings of poems which are perversely contrary to what Bloom dismissively rejects as inadequate "canonical" interpretations. Since each comments on a specific Browning poem, it is appropriate to allow them to speak briefly for themselves. From Bloom's "Introduction": In the Sublime agon between Roland and the reader, Browning stands aside, even at the very end, not because he is an "objective" as opposed to antithetical poet, but because he respects the aporia of the Dark Tower. Poetry is part of what the Gnostics called the Kenoma or cosmic and temporal emptiness, and not part of the Pleroma, the fullness of presence that is acosmic and atemporal. The Pleroma is always absent, for it inheres in the Abyss, the true, alien God who is cut off from nature and history, (p. 10) Next, from Leslie Brisman's "Back to the First of All: 'By the Fire-side' and Browning's Romantic Origins": Since there are no definitive verbal echoes of Prometheus Unbound in "By the Fire-side," no objective evidence internal or external to connect the two poems, the supposition that Shelley's poem is Browning's precursor text must rest on our sense that the awakening of love, the politics of visionary power, and the transposition into a visionary landscape of the concepts before and after, higher and lower, are central concerns which could have directed Browning back to Shelley's magnificent example, (p. 57)</page><page sequence="17">THOMAS J. COLLINS / 257 Finally, from Ann Wordsworth's "Browning's Anxious Gaze": Ostensibly, the clash in the poem ["My Last Duchess"] is between life and art - the warmth and carnal beauty of the woman and her subjection to the Duke's murderous fantasy. But behind this lies the relation of poet and precursor, doubly disguised insomuch as the precariousness of the belated poet is masked as a helpless subjection to critical misjudgements; in effect, J. S. Mill's critical misreading of Pauline stands in as a cover for Browning's misprision of Alastor. (p. 34) It is, granted, unfair to quote out of context in this manner. But the above should prove sufficiently provocative to move readers to consider the complete essays and arrive at their own evaluations when occasion permits. I find the passages, and the essays from which they are derived, disturbing, because they reflect inadequate methodologies now popular in some contemporary criticism: that is, an eagerness to ignore evidence, to treat texts as personal hunting-grounds for the esoteric and whimsical, and to offer as proof simple assertion ("I think, therefore it is"). Lastly, this collection represents a kind of academic patronage which is disquieting in these times of difficulty for young academics and, indeed, for higher education itself.</page><page sequence="18">FitzGerald and Minor Mid-Victorian Poets Michael Helfand [Editor's Note: Professor Helfand, on leave from the University of Pittsburgh, writes from Shanghai: "I've kept in touch with Tobias and he tells me that there's not much this year to review. I did bring his book since I intended to review it last year, but got caught up in the China preparations. For next year I'll review at least the first two volumes of FitzGerald's Letters."] Thomas Edward Brown, the Mid-Victorian poet from the Isle of Man, is remembered (if he is remembered at all) for "My Garden," a poem which, like "Whistler's Mother," has found a place in the hearts and on the walls of many sentimentalists. The ongoing Twayne series has made it possible for a contemporary scholar, Richard Tobias, and for his readers, to re-examine the poet's life and work in T. E. Brown [1978]. Any study of a minor poet like Brown must not only serve an introductory function, it must also consider, at least implicitly, the nature and quality of the poet's contribution. Tobias' study fulfills both these needs. Tobias' approach is historical, then critical. He provides the reader with historical and literary information which clarifies Brown's themes, places his work in the context of Victorian and Manx cultures, and suggests literary standards by which the poetry might best be judged. In doing research for what Tobias thought would be a "straightforward" study of Brown, he found much that he had not expected. He found that [Brown's] poems . . . were not published as he wrote them. His letters were re-written, cut, or unpublished. The previous biography, a "Memoir" signed by Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch, was actually written by another man. This book, therefore, reveals a Thomas Edward Brown unknown before. These findings are in themselves contributions to scholarship and provide other scholars with new possibilities for research and for critical studies based on the new texts. One of these new critical studies has already been written: it is the second section of Tobias' book. The first (biographical) section of the book shows Brown as a man caught in the tensions between 259</page><page sequence="19">260 I VICTORIAN POETRY the rough-hewn folk culture of his native Isle of Man and the complex charm and intelligence of Oxford and middle class English society. Tobias suggests that this tension finds structural expression in Brown's poems, which often start in dualities and strive toward reconciliation. But Brown was never at ease in Arnold's Zion. While Oxford believed it was polishing a rough young Manxman, the young Manxman felt that Oxford was simply rubbing him the wrong way. In short, his heart was in the island. He withdrew from conflict with the wider world to cultivate his own garden, to concentrate his poetic efforts on Manx dialect poetry. It is in the dialect poetry that Tobias sees Brown's finest achievements. Consequently he devotes half of his book to a description and analysis of the Manx Fo'c's'le Yarns, First, Second and Third Series and only one chapter to Brown's English lyrics. He does not, however, throw out the English poems wholesale. On the contrary, he thinks several of Brown's less celebrated English works, and that means everything but "My Garden," are well worth reading. One poem in particular, "Chalse-A-Killey," should probably be included in standard anthologies of nineteenth-century poetry. And about Brown's celebrated poem Tobias makes a comment which is well worth reading (even if the poem is not !): " 'My Garden' seems to us a cultural expression so appallingly bad and apparent that finally we begin to see genius in its total banality, its total realization of itself." In part, the existence of "My Garden" is justified because it provided the occasion for that critical remark. About the Manx dialect poetry Tobias has much more to say. He sees similar themes running through both English and dialect poetry, but the dialect poetry is, he believes, more interesting to modern readers since in the original versions Brown avoided banal and genteel versifying by writing in the less inhibited tradition and language of folk poetry. Brown's English editor, however, obviously yearned for the banal and the genteel and exercised the kind of editorial policy which has been a boon to modern scholars. Tobias describes the editing as disastrous because the skeletons which were so carefully put in the closet provide the life, comedy, and energy in the poems. The effect of cutting bawdy language and action from the texts was most aptly summed up by Brown himself when he said the editor had left one of his heroes a "castrato." Brown himself realized that his Manx writings were an epic which was unacceptable to the reading public of his own time. So he wrote, as he said, for the future. The epic was unacceptable for at least two reasons. First Brown wrote about "impossible unions," loves which dared not speak their names - or show their faces - in respectable Victorian society. Then again, Tobias remarks, "Brown's stories all turn on the new invasion of British power." And he continues, "The thirst for story proves the Manx effort to understand a new invasion. Communities tell stories not only for</page><page sequence="20">FRANK R. GIORDANO, JR. / 261 amusement but to seek control over powers in the world." So Brown tried to be the social voice of the folk culture of his island as it encountered and was threatened by a new British invasion. The young man who suffered at Oxford became the poet who affirmed and preserved the dignity of Manx culture when it was threatened. This new T. E. Brown which Tobias has unearthed is a much more interesting writer than the revised and fictionalized Brown who was created by Victorian editors and biographers. Of course this new Brown offers no threat to the gardeners of the world: his words will remain their creed. But for students of Victorian literature this new Brown offers richer fare, a nineteenth-century folk epic which plays variations on the theme of "roots." Thomas Hardy Frank R. Giordano, Jr. The valuable project of editing Thomas Hardy's notebooks, so ably begun by Lennart A. Bjork in 1974, is advanced by Richard H. Taylor's edition of The Personal Notebooks of Thomas Hardy. The private record of Hardy's thoughts, observations, concerns, and social activities over a period of six decades, the notebooks reflect the author's eye for passing detail, as well as his reticence and restraint. Four notebooks are presented. The "Memoranda" notebooks, I and II, contain no startling confidences and enunciate no striking literary theories; but, while the first is very much the private notebook of a working author, the second is more of a personal diary. Carried up to September of 1927, three months before Hardy died, "Memoranda II" was used extensively by Florence Hardy in preparing the last two chapters of the Life. Taylor identifies three categories of notes: literary and antiquarian, social, and personal. Possible plots for stories, notes on poetry and poetic form, ideas on the nature of art and the role of inspiration are found here, making these two notebooks valuable complements of the Literary Notebooks edited by Bjork. Hardy's recording of his visitors at Max Gate, interpreted as snobbish name- dropping by some, at least partly dispels, for Taylor, the notion that Hardy was a gloomy, stingy old man. The "Schools of Painting" Notebook appears to be a part of Hardy's determined self-education project of the mid-1860's, when he contemplated a career as an art critic. The pedestrian recording of the "schools," with names of artists, dates, and chief characteristics and advancements of their art, seems derived from some</page><page sequence="21">262/ VICTORIAN POETRY guidebooks to the painters, rather than from a course of lectures Hardy may have taken. The "Trumpet-Major" Notebook dates Hardy's preparations for that novel from the spring of 1878 and onwards. The notebook shows both the sort and range of mate rial that Hardy considered to have potential: there are records from newspaper accounts, local histories, personal biographies, details from caricatures, advertisements for modes of conveyance and clothing, drawings of military apparel, even details from smuggling tales and duels, and lists of theatrical events attended by the Royal Family. Hardy cannot be faulted in his use of historical materials, Taylor believes. Some of the research conducted for The Trumpet-Major was useful in Hardy's writing of The Dynasts', this notebook allows scholars to trace his use of such materials for those impressive "historical" creations. An important appendix to Taylor's edition is his selection of "Passages Omitted from the Life" Taylor gives a balanced account of Hardy's preparation of his autobiography; and he claims that the omitted passages, though they do not radically alter the self-portrait, "conjoin with the Life itself to constitute Hardy's autobiography exactly as he wrote it." This is perhaps an exaggerated claim, as it is not fully clear who, Hardy or Florence or T. E. Lawrence or J. M. Barrie, was responsible for certain excisions. The centrality of the Life for Hardy studies, and the established fact of its being one of his own productions, requires that it be presented in a "critical edition," with variants and omitted passages; further, the work ought to be included in any collected edition of Hardy's complete works. At any rate, Taylor's assiduous efforts do highlight Hardy's self-consciousness about his humble origins, his volatile reactions to critical incompetence, and Florence's "pernicious, if understandable" dulling of the memory of Emma. Emma is the subject of Denys Kay-Robinson's The First Mrs. Thomas Hardy, and she is defended vigorously against the often unsupported and insupportable claims of Weber, Deacon and Coleman, and Gittings. No literary nincompoop by any means, Emma was the encourager and helpmate of Hardy in all his writing through Tess, often offering suggestions he incorporated in his works. The only woman who occupied Hardy's heart after 187 1 , Emma is given credit for saving Hardy as a writer when his desponding insecure self led him to consider abandoning authorship. Kay-Robinson's speculations on Hardy's "sexual difficulty" are often ludicrous, sometimes in poor taste, and finally inconclusive. But on Hardy's insensitivity to Emma, he seems both fair-minded and generous, without mitigating Hardy's guilt for being unappreciative of Emma's help in the early years of authorship, for publishing poems about his early "love-affairs," and for encouraging younger women to publish while ignoring his wife's literary pretensions. Kay-Robinson writes: "It was</page><page sequence="22">FRANK R. GIORDANO, JR. / 263 not intentional cruelty; he would have been shocked (as after her death he was shocked) to realise that he was being cruel at all. It was rather as though all his perceptiveness, his finesse were reserved for the characters in his novels." Emma herself wrote, bitterly, "He understands only the women he invents - the others not at all." Kay-Robinson's thesis is that Hardy's love for Emma never died. The failure to have a child, the removal to Max Gate, Hardy's outstripping Emma in literary attainments, her inability to live in contentment with a "great man" (despite her futile efforts to learn how), the "poisonous" influence of young and attractive society women, and the pair's retreat from communication when her opposition to "his unchristian views" and their different attitudes to the meaning of matrimony increased their estrangement after the mid-1890's, represent the falling action in the tragedy of the Hardys' marriage. But it was "his gloom over Emma," the increasing separation between them, and not his love for other women, that inspired most of his best poetry during the 1890's and 1900's. And Hardy's reaction to Emma's death, which is registered in the magnificent "Poems of 1912-13," was not a "turn-about but an explosion of emotions constricted for twenty years." Kay-Robinson's study of the first Mrs. Hardy can be read along with Robert Gittings and Jo Manton's treatment of Florence in The Second Mrs. Hardy. The early and later phases of Florence's life, both the period when, trained at her father's home in anxious compliance and devotion to duty, she undertook the "drudgery of teaching" and suffered regularly from ill-health and the frustration of her dreams for a life in literature, and the years after Hardy's death when she served long and usefully in the community and on civic councils in Dorchester, are effectively presented and supplement our limited knowledge of Hardy's second wife. Florence's regular attraction to older men, Sir Thornley Stoker before she married Hardy, and Sir J. M. Barrie after, is explained as "genius worship"; and she is given credit, because of her sacrificial devotion and care, for enabling Hardy to produce his finest late poems. Unlike Kay-Robinson, Gittings and Manton consider Florence the central woman responsible for the late poetry; Hardy's treatment of Emma in those fine late poems is presumably the result of his confusion of a romantic setting with a romantic attachment. That's a hard theory to accept. To the important questions of how Hardy and Florence first met, and why she married him, Gittings and Manton cannot offer sure answers. In reply to the latter, they suggest that attachment to the world of literature, fame, and social connections were powerful motives. Florence didn't love Hardy in 1913, and even felt he wasn't lovable; the one man she did love, a sickly journalist-poet named Alfred Hyatt, couldn't afford to marry before his early death. Gittings and Manton believe there was very little sex or</page><page sequence="23">264 / VICTORIAN POETRY love-making between Hardy and Florence; and they find no evidence that she was ever Stoker's mistress. In fact, they go so far as to suggest that Florence was unaware of the adulterous overtones to her seaside holidays with Hardy at Edward Clodd's home at Aldeburgh. Clodd himself alludes to Meredith in describing her as "The Lady." But in the 1920's, she did develop a strong vein of affection for Hardy. Joan Grundy's Hardy and the Sister Arts is an impressively learned study of Hardy's use of the "Composite Muse" to communicate how life felt to his characters. Hardy is the "sentient seer" who emphasizes the "feel of old terrestrial stress"; he calls on his own wide experience in the "sister arts" to intensify the expression of things. Grundy summarizes her thesis: "The pictorial arts, drama, music, dance, song and story all assist him in his re- creation of a vision of life that at its best is 'more truthful than the truth'; that indeed goes beyond vision (something seen) to become also experience (something both seen and felt). From a concentration of Art (meaning here aesthetic modes, rather than craft or skill as such), a concentrated effect of Life is obtained." In her discussions of Hardy as an artist of the Dutch school, a Victorian genre and narrative and portrait painter, a landscape artist with affinities to Turner and Claude and other Impressionists, Grundy uses her rich aesthetic experience to describe Hardy's techniques in making readers see and feel. She is equally exciting and suggestive in associating his syntheses of drama, picture, and music with the subtle and sophisticated ideas and experiments of such artists as Wagner, Delacroix, and Eisenstein; also she is sensitive to and illuminating about Hardy's artistic uses of such popular forms as melodrama, pantomime and the harliquinade, the magic-lantern show, panoramas, dioramas, and even fairs and circuses. Grundy's is a most stimulating, inspiring book. Ross C. Murfin's Swinburne, Hardy, Lawrence, and the Burden of Belief (1978) is an intelligent study, descending from Harold Bloom's "revisionist" approach to the reading of nineteenth-century poetry. Looking closely at Hardy's earliest poetry (1865-67), Murfin argues that Swinburne's influence can be perceived in the dark and melancholy questioning in the poems of the romantic world-view, in their tendency toward deifying abstraction, in their obsessively precise metrical (or diametrical) sound patterns, in their plaintive protest against time's ruination of the life-tree, and in their implicit denial of transcendental possibilities. If the influence of Swinburne seems overstated here, it is partly because Murfin believes that Swinburne's value for Hardy has been underestimated or ignored. And if one could argue that Hardy could have been reacting to the ideas, language, poems of other writers and not to Swinburne alone, Murfin is very well aware of it. His prose rings with echoes not only of Swinburne, but of Carlyle, Arnold, Tennyson, and others; their presences, alongside Swinburne's, are discriminated when it is</page><page sequence="24">HOWARD W. FULWEILER / 265 appropriate, just as his distinctive contributions (as in the poetic structure founded upon acts of defiance followed by acts of surrender, or in the tone of voice latent with both acquiescence and anger) are highlighted. Murfin seems quite at ease in employing Bloom's method, feeling little "anxiety of influence" himself; but at the end of his discussion of "New Works" (chapter 4), he seems compelled to insist on Hardy's anxiety about Swinburne's "priority." Such a Bloomian orthodoxy seems inexact and even irrelevant, as Swinburne may be the one ancestor whom Hardy always acknowledged with praise and never had to kill off. Space does not permit discussion of journal essays, but the appearance of William Pritchard's "Hardy's Winter Words" in the Hudson Review (32: 369-397) may be a sign that Hardy's poetry and the "common reader" are about to converge. Gerard Manley Hopkins Howard W. Fulweiler Ruth Seelhammer has earned the gratitude of Hopkins scholars with her thoroughly comprehensive "A Hopkins Bibliography: 1978" (HQ 6: 95-106), a continuation of Richard F. Giles's bibliography for 1974-77 (HQ 5 [1978]: 87-122). Jerome Bump offers an aid to biographical research by making scholars aware of the autograph poems, letters, drawings, and photographs of Hopkins at Texas in his "Catalogue of the Hopkins Collection in the Humanities Research Centre of the University of Texas" (HQ 5: 141-150). Three useful biographical essays appeared this year in HQ. In "Hopkins at Highgate: Biographical Fragments" (HQ 6:3-10), Michael Allsopp attempts to solve the variant accounts of events and chronology during Hopkins' Highgate years: What exactly was the name of the school at Highgate? What prizes did Hopkins win there? When exactly did Hopkins matriculate at Balliol? A different slice of Hopkins' life is treated by Francis Keegan, S. J., in "Gerard Manley Hopkins at Mount St. Mary's College, Spinkhill, 1877-1878" (HQ 6: 11-34). Keegan argues interestingly that it was much more likely that Hopkins was sent to the College because a classical scholar was needed "than that he left St. Beuno's because he was considered unsuited to the further study of theology." Gerald Roberts offers more details about Hopkins' unhappiness from 1882 to 1884 in "The Jaded Muse: Hopkins at Stonyhurst" (HQ 6: 35-47). A most interesting</page><page sequence="25">266/ VICTORIAN POETR Y guide to Hawaiian materials related to Hopkins' father and uncle has been published by Eugene R. August in "A Checklist of Materials Relating to the Hopkins Family in the State Archives of Hawaii" (HQ 6: 61-83). Jerome Bump links the study of Hopkins' life with the interpretation of particular poems in "Providence, The Wreck of the Deutschland,' and a New Hopkins Letter" (Renascence 31: 195-204). He intelligently relates Hopkins' words of comfort to his sister, Grace, on the death of her betrothed to his earlier thoughts on death in "The Wreck." Leonard J. Bowman offers a general treatment of the poem in "Patterns of Participation in Hopkins' The Wreck of the Deutschland'" (C&amp;L 27 [1978]: 15-26). Although Bowman recognizes the validity of Alison Sulloway's interpretation of "The Wreck" as an example of nineteenth- century apocalyptic expectation, he proposes a complementary perspective drawn from the tradition of Franciscan exemplarism, in which the poem "is less a calamitous forecast of the end of history than a recognition of the power and presence of God in something as everyday as a newspaper clipping." Joaquin Kuhn argues capably in "The Completeness of Tied Beauty'" (SEL 18 [1978]: 677-692) that Hopkins' desire to find "unity at the heart of surface multiplicity" led him to render "Pied Beauty" unified and coherent in the Artistotelian tradition, showing the strength of his "centripetal tendency." B. J. Tysdahl relates "Spring and Fall" to Jeremy Taylor's collections of sermons "Preached at Golden Grove" and his manual The Golden Grove in "A Note on Hopkins's 'Goldengrove'" (ES 60: 192-194), arguing that this association with Taylor's retreat to Golden Grove, the estate of the second Earl of Carbery, after the difficulties of the Civil War may render Hopkins' poem darker than has been previously thought, more closely linked to the terrible sonnets. Patrick Swinden reiterates the common complaint that the difficulties in interpreting Hopkins are often very real in "Gerard Manley Hopkins: The Starlight Night'" {CritQ 21:57-60). Hopkins' hyphenated combinations, for instance, "suggest a habit of compression that can be more of a weakness than a strength." In his perceptive "Belief and Imagination in The Windhover'" (HQ 5: 127-137), John M. Warner questions the common idea, and its variants, that "the tone of the sonnet alters radically from the octave to the sestet." He ably argues that the poem has a unified tone and attitude, its meaning concerned with St. Augustine's prayer that "service is perfect freedom." Several "influence" studies relate Hopkins to other Victorian and earlier writers. Jerry A. Herndon's "Hopkins and Whitman" (WWR 24 [1978]: 161-162) suggests the possibility that "Spring and Fall" was influenced by "On the Beach at Night." Donald Walhout surveys biographical and "conceptual" relationships between Hopkins and Nietzsche, a pair of nineteenth-century sufferers both born in 1844, in</page><page sequence="26">HOWARD W. FULWEILER / 267 "Hopkins and Nietzsche: A Reflection" (HQ 6: 51-58). James David Earnest enlarges upon the fairly well canvassed subject of Pater's influence on his famous student in "G. M. Hopkins and Victorian Aestheticism: The Limits of Pater's Influence" (KPAB 5 [1978]: 9-17). Although he singles out the "late Victorian, Paterian note in Hopkins' early aesthetic," Earnest's main emphasis is on Hopkins' idealistic vision of an ordered world in contrast to "Paterian phenomenalism" and "subjectivism." Michael D. Moore has written two informative and painstaking essays on "affinities of thought and expression between the writings of Hopkins and those of Newman." "Newman and the 'Second Spring' of Hopkins's Poetry" (HQ 6:119-137) shows correspondences between Newman's sermons on the restoration of the Catholic hierarachy and "The Wreck of the Deutschland" and "The Loss of the Eurydice." "Newman and the Motif of Intellectual Pain in Hopkins' Terrible Sonnets'" (Mosaic 12, iv: 29-46) demonstrates interestingly the verbal parallels between Newman's sermons and "The Dream of Gerontius" and the sonnets of desolation. Sometimes the relationship is striking, as in Newman's advice "lovingly to adore the hand that afflicts us, and, as it is said, to kiss the rod, however sharply or long it smites us" in his Anglican sermon, "Chastisement and Mercy." J. J. Glavin's penetrating "The Exercise of Saints': Hopkins, Milton, and Patience" (TSLL 20: 139-152) considers the relation between Milton's sonnet "On His Blindness" and Hopkins' "Patience," emphasizing an imitation of antithesis. As Virgil and Sordello embrace in the Purgatorio, "so does Hopkins discover himself freed from the burden of his exile in responding to Milton's voice." Several general essays on Hopkins require mention. Two of these consider Hopkins from a religious point of view. Ronald Lane's "Gerard Manley Hopkins: Poet of Two Worlds" (ABR 29 [1978]: 260-274) is an intelligent discussion of Hopkins as a Christian poet and a religious. Barry Spurr emphasizes Hopkins' sacramentalism in "G. M. Hopkins - The Poet as Sacramentalist" (Sydney Studies in English 4 [1978-79]: 38-49). Emilie Sobel's psychoanalytical "Rhythm, Sound and Imagery in the Poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins" in Between Reality and Fantasy: Transitional Objects and Phenomena, ed. Simon A. Grolnick and Leonard Barkin in collaboration with Werner Muensterberger (1978), is uneven: often exasperating, sometimes reductive, it is occasionally illuminating. Her thesis is that creativity involves "access to a presymbolic intermediary mode of experiencing reality that originates in periods of childhood predating the achievement of logical thought and object constancy." Although Sobel is capable of the crudity that sometimes disfigures psychoanalytical criticism (e. g., in Hopkins "Christ, Mary, God, and the Holy Ghost are presented so as to evoke the preoedipal mother and the phallic stage father - with both of whom he longed to reunite"), she is</page><page sequence="27">268 / VICTORIAN POETRY sometimes quite perceptive. She points out, after discussion of the development of language in children, that "for Hopkins language was not a medium for the representation of reality, but rather participates in and presents reality." Michael Lynch has published an unscholarly effusion, "Recovering Hopkins, Recovering Ourselves" (HQ 6: 107-1 17), the aim of which is to "recover Hopkins as a gay poet." We are told that "the intimacy between Hopkins's daring and his gayness has long been humming but never allowed to sing" and asked if there is "not something gay about inscape itself?" Whether Hopkins was homosexual, and //he was, whether he was conscious or unconscious of the fact, may still be open to question, but to describe the author of "Spelt from Sibyl's Leaves" and "The Wreck of the Deutschland" as "gay" is an appalling misuse of language and distortion of cultural history. In "Hopkins: A Note on Scansion" (CQ 8: 230-235) B. J. Rosebury discusses the tension between sprung rhythm, in which a five stress line usually has more than ten syllables, and standard pentameter. A number of Hopkins' sonnets "appear to hesitate, or vacillate, between sprung and common rhythm." Donald Davie's "Poetry as Taking a Stand" (Shenandoah 29 [1978]: 45-52) is a thoughtful and stimulating discussion of the question of "belief in poetry. Hopkins was an "affirmative poet, with little or (it really seems) no patience with poetry that affirms only provisionally or under the mask of make-believe." Davie judges the insouciance of modern poetry and criticism, its unwillingness to "take a stand," against the plumbline of Hopkins' earnestness. The Pre-Raphaelites Allan R. Life Along with two books on Pre-Raphaelite typology that will dominate this year's survey, the chief contribution to Pre-Raphaelite studies has been R. W. Crump's variorum edition of The Complete Poems of Christina Rossetti. At least, the first volume has appeared, but its introduction and contents clearly anticipate the two still to come. This edition incorporates an immense amount of dedicated scholarship, and when completed it will provide a welcome replacement for the "standard" edition of 1904.</page><page sequence="28">ALLAN R. LIFE / 269 Doubtless some critics will censure Crump's decision to retain the order of Christina Rossetti's published collections, which constitute the first of three categories into which the edition is divided. The second category consists of poems individually published; the third, works either privately printed (including the 1847 Verses) or unpublished. The most obvious alternative would have been a chronological arrangement of the canon, and it is remarkable that well over a hundred of the poems in Crump's first volume were dated to - though not, as her textual notes have it, necessarily "composed" on - a specific day. But other works remain undatable, and it was William Rossetti's attempt to arrange the 1904 edition chronologically that resulted in some of the defects enumerated in two articles by David Kent (PRR 1 [1978]: 18-26; VP17: 259-264). Kent finds that the complete reordering of Verses (1893) in William Rossetti's edition has obliterated the "two quatrains of thematic focus" of the original work and typifies the indifference of Christina Rossetti's first editor to the poet's "large-scale structures for her writings." In Crump's edition, at least, the "structures" of such works as Verses will be retained. But Kent's arguments call into question a more debatable decision by this editor, to reproduce the arrangement of the first editions of Goblin Market (1862) and The Prince's Progress (1866)- not that of the volume of 1875 in which Christina not only combined the texts of these works but, as Crump notes, "completely rearranged the poems, omitting five entirely and incorporating thirty-seven new ones; she also made some word and punctuation changes and added some new lines" (p. 3). Similarly, although the 1 875 edition is "the last English version of Goblin Market and The Prince's Progress revised by the author herself," Crump's copy-text for poems reprinted in that volume is based on the earlier versions of 1862 and 1866. Beyond an allusion to "fresh printer's errors" introduced in 1875, Crump does not explain this procedure; she simply encourages the reader to consult the textual notes to her "eclectic text," through which he "can easily reconstruct the full text of every line" (p. xiii). In fact, since these notes are relegated to 79 pages at the end of the volume, without either titles or text pages designated in the running heads, scholars will find this "reconstruction" process less "easy" than Crump anticipates. This unserviceable format increases the need for the editor to identify all "cases where the printed spelling consistently differs from that in the manuscripts," and where she has consequently "emended the text to the manuscript spelling" (p. 233). These "cases" evidently include "though" and "through," which Crump consistently - and silently - abbreviates to "tho"' and "thro'." And the value of this edition would be increased if the third volume included a chronological list of datable poems, preferably with an indication of the source of the dates, which in the textual notes is not indicated even for poems unavailable in manuscript.</page><page sequence="29">270 / VICTORIAN POETRY Despite these defects, R. W. Crump's edition is incomparably superior to its predecessors, and it is regrettable that it was unavailable when Nilda Jimenez prepared her concordance to The Bible and the Poetry of Christina Rossetti. This remains, nevertheless, a work of great value, which fully deserves the detailed description and praise accorded it in this journal (see VP 17: 408). Besides outlining her own principles of selection with admirable lucidity, Jimeiiez' introduction illuminates Christina Rossetti's fondness for conflating a passage from the Old Testament with one from the New. And, if this conflation of passages is not strictly typological, it recalls an intention of Christina's devotional prose identified by Gisela Honnighausen: "to prove harmony in the Gospels and the prefigurative interpretation of the Old Testament" (VP 10 [1972]: 2, n. 1). Parallel aspects of her poetry are still largely unexplored, but the "brevity, force, and wit" of her use of one common type are praised by George P. Landow in "Moses Striking the Rock: Typological Symbolism in Victorian Poetry," in Literary Uses of Typology from the Late Middle Ages to the Present, ed. Earl Miner (1977). Miner's excellent collection exemplifies the growing significance of typological interpretation, which Landow also employs in his study of John Ruskin (1971) and in a series of articles which has culminated in William Holman Hunt and Typological Symbolism. Another advocate of this approach to Victorian culture is Herbert L. Sussman, who has published Fact into Figure: Typology in Carlyle, Ruskin, and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. As their titles suggest, these two books differ widely in scope. Landow restricts himself "fairly rigorously" to the development by Holman Hunt of "an integrated pictorial symbolism," achieved through typology and exemplified by "the central works" of Hunt's career: The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple (1854-60), The Shadow of Death ( 1869-73), and The Triumph of the Innocents ( 1 876-87). Even the obviously typological canvas of A Converted British Family sheltering a Christian Priest from the Persecution of the Druids (1849-50), which Hunt himself cited in 1855 as an exemplum of "my idea of Pre-Raphaelitism" (Sussman, p. 74), suffers in Landow's view from a "divided intention," which prevented the artist from adopting a Christian type as an iconographic center. Similarly, despite fairly detailed discussions of typological symbolism in works by J. E. Millais and D. G. Rossetti, Landow is avowedly selective in his references to the P.R.B. and indeed to Hunt's role in it. By contrast, Sussman attempts the formidable task of reconstructing "the artistic and literary paradigm of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood" (p. xvi), and his interpretations of early works by Hunt, Rossetti, and other figures complement those by Landow. Unfortunately, Sussman vitiates some of these interpretations through his efforts to reduce the Brotherhood aesthetic to a pseudo-</page><page sequence="30">ALLAN R. LIFE / 271 Auerbachian figuralism that is at once sacramental and righteously ethical. Combined with these defining attributes is a kind of figural objectivity that Sussman ascribes to the original version of "My Sister's Sleep," where "the phenomenal world" is seen "as separate and distinct from the perceiving mind, as a world in which objects have an intrinsic divine meaning that inevitably emerges from their precise representation" (pp. 84-85). In fact, the subjective, interpretive basis of early Pre-Raphaelitism is stressed in numerous comments not only by W. M. Rossetti but by Holman Hunt, who repudiates the "realist" label that still adheres to the movement, and declares "that a man's work must be the reflex of a living image in his own mind, and not the icy double of the facts themselves." The world, he continues, must be "interpreted into beauty," and he emphasizes that the "utmost elaboration" employed in early Pre-Raphaelite art was seen from the first as a form of artistic tuition {Pre-Raphaelitism [1905], I, 150). This side of the movement is inadequately acknowledged by Sussman, whose unqualified generalizations ("according to the Brotherhood . . . ," "to the Brotherhood . . . ," "the Brotherhood felt . . .") raise a hoard of exceptions that demolish his theory. Of all the Brethren, D. G. Rossetti least resembles the messianic "artist-scientist" who personifies Sussman's version of the P.R.B. This fact does not elude Sussman entirely, and by setting back the origin of the Brotherhood two years to "a conversation of 1846" between Hunt and Millais (p. 33) he denies Rossetti a formative role in the original movement. This date is in fact incorrect: from allusions to works in progress (see Hunt, I, 8 1), this conversation can be dated February, 1 848, the year also given by Hunt in a related statement to J. G. Millais (see J. E. Millais' Life and Letters [1899], 1, 49). Furthermore, the effort to found the Brotherhood on what F. G. Stephens, in his printed reply to Pre-Raphaelitism (1906), calls these "as to their details, hardly credible, accounts of discussions with Millais," distorts the events of the succeeding half year, including the intimacy between Hunt and Rossetti that began in May, 1848, and the efforts several weeks later to establish a literary society and to replace a sketching club which Sussman with more accuracy than consistency calls "the immediate forerunner of the Brotherhood" (p. 116). Such scholarly lapses are exacerbated by Sussman's imprecise use of theoretical concepts derived from C. S. Lewis' Allegory of Love ( 1936) and Erich Auerbach's essay "Figura," translated in Scenes from the Drama of European Literature (1959). In one characteristic observation, Sussman declares that Auerbach's comments on the Vita Nuova "exactly describe the young Rossetti's sense of this work" (p. 35; see also p. 121). This discovery might well have surprised Auerbach, who complains later in "Figura" (p. 73) that "the romantic realism of the nineteenth century overemphasized the human Beatrice"; in any case Sussman is confusing</page><page sequence="31">272/ VICTORIAN POETRY resemblance with identity. Sussman's incautious expropriation of critical ideas is also reflected in his vocabulary and methodology: he uses "antitype" to denote the opposite of a type, rather than its fulfillment (see pp. 23, 29), and in his chapter on "Literary Painting" he regularly employs "figure" as a synonym for "symbolize"; identifies "moral types" with a relentlessness less appropriate to typology than to tropology; and proposes that, "in a narrow sense," Millais' Lorenzo and Isabella "adapts typological methods" by "prefiguring" a coming narrative event (p. 99). Instead of "narrowness," such a reading exemplifies a more than Victorian breadth of definition, designed apparently to impose unity on Pre-Raphaelite art but serving chiefly to distort the narrative paintings of Millais, to which Sussman brings little sympathy and less understanding. Sussman's obvious misapplication of figural concepts is avoided by Landow, who bases his interpretations not only on Auerbach but on nineteenth-century expositions of typology. This concern with Victorian theory is essential to Landow's thesis: that typology constituted a sufficiently public symbolic mode for Hunt to employ it in a "program of sacred realism," in pictures which conveyed spiritual concepts to at least part of a culture that found visual allegory unacceptable if not incomprehensible. To say, "other aspects or bases of visual allegory" would misrepresent Landow's "crucial distinction" between allegory, "which interprets one thing as in reality signifying another," and typology, which "traces the connections and similarities between two unique events, each of which is equally real. ... In allegory the signifier can be cast off like an empty husk once its meaning has been understood" (pp. 9-10). Later, this idea reappears in less qualified form: "In allegory the literal meaning is essentially cast away as soon as its meaning, the kernel, is perceived" (p. 150). In support of this distinction, Landow cites Patrick Fairburn's Typology of Scripture and Erich Auerbach's Mimesis, where the Church Fathers are commended for maintaining "the basic historical reality of figures, against all attempts at spiritually allegorical interpretation" (p. 1 0). However, the central issue raised by Landow's description of typology does not pertain to readings of the Bible, whether by the Church Fathers or by Fairburn, but to the degree to which, under various conditions, what Dante calls "the allegory of the theologians" can be reconciled with "the allegory of the poets." Or, more precisely, to what extent can Victorian literature and art be discussed in terms of typology, which is essentially a theological tool of debatable relevance even to many medieval works? Investigators of this question might well adopt A. C. Charity's distinction, in Events and their Afterlife: The Dialectics of Christian Typology in the Bible and Dante (1966), between "dogmatic" Christian typology- "the science of history's relations to its fulfilment in Christ"- and the kind of "figural</page><page sequence="32">ALLAN R. LIFE / 273 interpretation" described by Auerbach, which "establishes a connection between two events or persons, the first of which signifies not only itself but also the second, while the second encompasses or fulfills the first." Like Landow, Auerbach emphasizes the historicity of "the two poles of the figure": "only the understanding of the two persons or events is a spiritual act" ("Figura," p. 53). This "act" of simultaneous apprehension remains, nevertheless, a formidable achievement, and Theodore Ziolkowski rightly emphasizes that Auerbach's general formulation, as much as Charity's "dogmatic" one, posits "a mystical relationship between two historically discrete events." Ziolkowski further argues that acceptance of such phenomena had coalesced by the Victorian period into what Earl Miner terms the "conservative undertow" that "accompanied the rising tide of historicism" (Miner, pp. 346, 392). Of course, the strength of that undertow should not be underestimated: in The Triumph of Time (1966) Jerome Hamilton Buckley declares that "many" Victorians retained a Christian view of history (see p. 23), and Landow, while conceding "the rather anachronistic notions of time and existence implicit in typological symbolism," maintains that "the Victorian poet . . . had an audience that was both capable of following his use of figuralism and delighted to discover commonplace types in new contexts" (Miner, pp. 333, 342). It seems impossible, however, that the original spirit of typological thought was as pervasive in the period as the letter of it; in his book on Hunt, Landow cites several Victorians whose identification of types in the artist's works was not accompanied by a corresponding sense of either the historicity or the spirituality of these images, and he himself commiserates with Hunt for "working without a living iconographic tradition" (p. 165). In itself, this concession raises doubts about Landow's distinction between typology and allegory in the Victorian period. Quite apart from this issue, however, Landow's husk-kernel version of allegory is incompatible with most current thinking on this subject. If, as Angus Fletcher argues in Allegory (1964), allegory is "a mode of symbolizing," found in virtually all literature to some degree and never encountered as "a pure modality," then the notion is simply invalid that its literal or "secondary" level of meaning can be removed, let alone discarded, like an orange peel. Furthermore, the historical reality of type and antitype emphasized by Landow does not in itself distinguish typology from an allegory like Dryden's Absalom and Achitophel. Earl Miner is more persuasive when he proposes: "Is typology not unique among symbolic systems in having a triple historical presumption: in the type, in the antitype, and in their connection?" (Miner, p. 390). Yet, even as he advances this defining quality, Miner acknowledges that, years before the Victorian period,</page><page sequence="33">274 / VICTORIAN POETRY it does seem quite clear that people were losing belief in the reality or historical character of type and antitype; or, what was still more deflating, that many believers came to grant so great a historicity to the type and the antitype that the historical connection that is the essence of typology was no longer credible, (p. 392) In the Biblical art of Holman Hunt, the conflicts articulated by Miner approach their ultimate development. I say "approach" because, for all its antiquarianism, Hunt's art is not naturalistic to the degree cultivated by such Biblical illustrators as James Tissot. Throughout his career, Hunt strove to reconcile the momentary with the monumental, and in formal terms that aim is facilitated through a blend of planar composition, conventional poses and configurations, and a meticulously linear and progressively tactile style that Madox Brown called "microscopic." In The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple these qualities reinforce Hunt's intention, which is evidently to avoid both the pitfalls described by Miner: that is, he is trying to capture the historical reality of an event within which type and antitype are not only present but connected within divine as well as human time. And with one "pole of the figure," the type, Hunt has succeeded impressively: the accouterments of the rabbis are both historically credible and emblematic of the Jewish dispensation, while their realistic poses and facial expressions convincingly embody "types" of response to Christ's teaching. Mary and Joseph, too, are naturalistically realized even as their figures are juxtaposed with that of their son to form an essentially triangular configuration. But the portrayal of a Hebrew boy serving as Exegete and Exegesis, as historical personage and embodiment of the new dispensation, is beyond Hunt. Frontally disposed to the picture plane, gazing iconically inward as he reputedly comprehends his mission, Hunt's Saviour seems less a participant within both human and divine time than an interloper between them. Physiognomically, the auburn-haired, blue -eyed youth resembles an Arthur Hughes angel, and what F. G. Stephens terms "the fine Englishness of [Mr. Hunt's] idea of the splendid body of our Lord" (Landow, p. 93) now seems a glaring inconsistency. Even at the debut of the picture, D. G. Rossetti's criticism went further; to him the entire work was "a wooden puppet-show of enlarged views" (Letters, ed. Doughty and Wahl [1965-67], I, 371), and contained in that verdict is a denial that the canvas conveys even the reality of a historical event, let alone the providential connection between numinous participants. This discussion has emphasized the issues raised by Hunt's representation of Christ because, beyond quoting a few contemporary eulogies, Landow hardly addresses them. His chief concern is with the process through which Hunt "patterns his iconography according to a complex structure of types and prophecies which further serve, much in the manner of Van Eyck and Memlinc, to transform this realistically depicted</page><page sequence="34">ALLAN R. LIFE / 275 earth and time into ... a sacred space and time" (p. 101). However, as Miner's analysis of typology emphasizes, a "transformation" of the Temple picture in Landow's terms must be founded on the historical reality - or at least on the historical verisimilitude - of type and antitype. As for Landow's description of Hunt's "iconography," his very use of this word again calls into question the distinction between typology and allegory on which his interpretations are based. In his analysis of The Shadow of Death, for example, Landow comments on the two pomegranates, or passion fruits, "long taken to represent the Passion of Christ": "here . . . , in the manner of many Victorian exegetes, the painter has moved from typological to allegorical modes" (p. 121). More appropriate to Biblical hermeneutics than to the analysis of visual art, such a distinction needlessly fragments the interpretive transition from motif to image outlined by Erwin Panofsky. According to Panofsky, the "pure forms" of artistic motifs become images in the process of iconographical analysis, through which they convey either "the idea . . . of concrete and individual persons or objects (such as St. Bartholomew, Venus, Mrs. Jones, or Windsor Castle)" or the idea of "abstract and general notions such as Faith, Luxury, Wisdom, etc." And, though Panofsky calls combinations of images of the first type "stories" rather than "allegories," he concedes that "there are many intermediary possibilities" between these two categories {Meaning in the Visual Arts [1970 (1955)], p. 54, n. 1). In practice, indeed, visual allegory as interpreted by Panofsky, E. H. Gombrich, and other members of the Warburg School of art history has not been narrowed much further than this definition: "A visual allegory is an illustration in which the total interaction of imagery generates a dominant meaning related to some other concept or event than the one ostensibly illustrated." If this definition is accepted, then the two works with which Landow epitomizes Hunt's typological "program," the Temple picture and The Shadow of Death, are essentially allegorical. Of course, The Shadow of Death in particular does exemplify distinctions between the tenors of certain images and between the modes of perceiving them. To most Victorians, the pomegranates in this picture would doubtless have remained motifs, but with the help of the title and the inscription on the frame, they would have identified Hunt's figure with Christ, and associated its posture with that of the crucified Saviour once they had studied the shadow of the figure falling on a\ horizontal tool-rack. But it would be a feat comparable to experiencing the view of history governed by "dogmatic" Christian typology to see Hunt's figure simultaneously as type and as antitype, as weary carpenter and as crucified Saviour, or, in more orthodox typological usage, to see the entire scene simultaneously as the end of Jesus' working day and as a combined Passion and Crucifixion. Landow may well speak of "the symbolic potential of the type to place the spectator in the presence of two events, the</page><page sequence="35">276/ VICTORIAN POETRY prefiguring and its fulfilment" (p. 101), but he presents no evidence that the full, "mystical" extent of this response was experienced in front of Hunt's canvases. Landow seems bent, in fact, on compensating for contemporary unresponsiveness; to him, Hunt's iconography in The Shadow of Death, "like that of Northern Renaissance Annunciations," generates "a miraculous fusion of body and spirit, time and eternity" (p. 121), and he hails the work as the fulfillment of Hunt's ambition to create "a painting that demands both an immediate emotional response and one that is meditative and analytical" (p. 125). In the halftone reproduction he provides, perhaps it is, but in the large original canvas the strident hues and blazing highlights, the insistent plasticity of every muscle and every wood shaving, scarcely induce a "meditative" response to the symbolism of the work. And Landow's neglect of the formal attributes of this canvas is particularly objectionable because of his very different treatment of The Scapegoat. This has been, for some twentieth-century viewers, one of Hunt's really powerful creations; in his rendering through characteristic formal methods of the grotesque type and its surroundings, and in the interaction between those motifs and the "prefigurative" passages on the frame, the artist has vividly realized a subject "well-suited," in John Gere's words, "to his ... tormented genius" (Pre-Raphaelite Painters [1948], p. 31). But for Landow, as for several Victorian reviewers, this "disastrous" picture of "a mere goat" is "a formal and aesthetic failure" (pp. 107, 1 1 1). Landow's lengthy denunciation of The Scapegoat raises fewer questions about the work itself than about his own "formal" and "aesthetic" criteria. Intensely conscious of "the limited nature of the visual image" (p. 152), Landow recognizes how "the presence of complex symbolic statements" can force us back "to the visual elements" of Pre- Raphaelite pictures, "thus insuring that we fully perceive the aesthetic surface" (Miner, p. 330). But of how the beholder is led, through formal as well as iconographic means, to evolve these "statements," Landow shows less appreciation. When he discusses Pre-Raphaelite poetry, Landow notes how "intensely perceived details" can convey "the psychological state in which some event is perceived" (p. 154), but when he encounters analogous effects in The Scapegoat he responds with theoretical pronouncements on the kind of "realism" that Hunt himself disavowed. Throughout his study, Landow's approach to visual art is excessively iconographic, if not theological, and though his preoccupation with typological symbolism has isolated a major component of Hunt's inspiration, he does not always relate it with sufficient clarity to the rest of what he calls the artist's "complex intention." The statement, for example, that once Hunt had experienced the Middle East, "landscape, costume, physiognomic types, and other such matters of fact now had a vital importance for [him] and his</page><page sequence="36">BENJAMIN FRANKLIN FISHER IV / 277 art" (p. 75; my italics), discounts the aesthetic program which Hunt had evolved and applied with "vital" urgency during the previous decade, and which he after all describes in a work entitled Pre-Raphaelitism - not Typologism. Symptomatic of the continuity betwen Hunt's work in the Middle East and his earlier career is the fact that, as early as October, 1850, he and Rossetti had proposed visiting Jerusalem together to paint Biblical subjects "on the spot" (see Sussman, p. 137). This proposal alone raises questions about the emphasis placed by Landow - and, to be fair, by the artist himself - on Hunt's religious conversion around 1851; before this, Landow maintains, Hunt could not focus his work on Christian typology, which in the Holy Land moved to "the center of his vision of the world" (p. 75). Yet Rossetti, who experienced neither a decisive religious conversion nor a sojourn in the Middle East, is cited by Landow as the Pre-Raphaelite who rivalled Holman Hunt as a practitioner of typological symbolism. Such facts raise questions about the relationship between Pre-Raphaelite faith and practice that need clarification, along with the degree to which the spirit as well as the letter of typological thought actually existed in the Victorian period. These issues are acknowledged in Landow's innovative study, but they must be addressed further before the Pre-Raphaelite conversion of fact into figure can be understood. The Poets of the Nineties Benjamin Franklin Fisher IV Current nineties materials yield two significant harvests: G. A. Cevasco's J. K. Huysmans: A Reference Guide (1980) and Richard Perceval Graves's A. E. Housman: Scholar and Poet. The second is perhaps the longer awaited book, but both are valuable because they are not likely to be superseded. Each marshalls significant, and, in the case of Cevasco's, insignificant (although that is no fault of his) scholarship bearing on its subject. With its broader coverage, Cevasco's offers more surprises. Cevasco's pages remind us that Huysmans was often considered the quintessential decadent, as well as the quintessential influence upon the nineties decadence in Britain. That Dorian Gray is mentioned in numerous annotations is no wonder; that Huysmans's impact is foremost upon poets may be. I have remarked in previous essays on the nineties that "poet" must be more broadly construed in speaking of this period than it commonly is.</page><page sequence="37">278/ VICTORIAN POETRY Cevasco's references to Beardsley (one excellent essay, from 1978, on the Huysmans-Beardsley relationship is by Cevasco himself), Beerbohm, or Whistler bear out this theory. For that matter, Dorian Gray is poetic, cadenced prose in many passages, although strict constructionists may take comfort in knowing that Wilde's "The Sphinx" and Le Gallienne's "The Decadent to His Soul" also carry strong impresses of A Rebours. Another artist who blurred distinctions between verse and prose techniques, especially in his own tales, Edgar Allan Poe, appears prominently in these pages. That his influence comes to British literature through the medium of Huysmans contributes dimension to the label of "decadent" often applied to him. Poe also appealed to other French writers who in their turn were assimilated by the daring young men of the nineties. Ironically, such a writer as T. S. Eliot, whose major poems often bear marks of the surrealism inherent in writing that crosses generic lines, published a pronouncement hostile to the popularity of A Rebours, remarking that it was easily dispensable as an "aesthetic eccentricity of the nineties." Many who loomed large in British literature during the nineties and beyond appear elsewhere in this book, all in the surroundings of pertinent annotation: Symons, Yeats, Joyce, The Yellow Book, The Savoy are "placed" in relation to Huysmans. All this, and much more, attest to Cevasco's diligence and the need to keep in mind the increasing importance accorded to the nineties. Huysmans is only one, if an important one, of the personages whose relationships with this era demand additional study in order to clarify the internationality of the poets of the nineties, as opposed to the insularity with which English writers are often charged. A. E. Housman's life has also been in need of greater clarification because of his veiled homosexuality, a characteristic that causes much irrelevant speculation in assessments of his verse. That clarification Richard Perceval Graves provides. Because many recent reviews of A. E. Housman: Scholar and Poet are tepid at best, it is proper to remark here that Graves has sifted the truths and half-truths surrounding his subject to put together a splendid book. It errs neither on the side of "the life" nor on that of "the works." Circumstances, most of them unpleasant - the early death of Housman's mother when he himself was just twelve, the increasing debility and debt of his father, the failure in Oxford examinations, the anguish caused by Housman's desire for Moses Jackson, the long, lonely years in academic life - conspired to fashion the A. E. Housman of stern mien and glacial reserve. Graves, rightly, reveals that much of Housman's long life was spent in suffering because his yearning to communicate with others was frustrated by intense shyness and by his feeling that his sexual preferences set him apart from the general run of humanity. This is a no-nonsense book, and, pace certain detractors, it is not over- written or repetitive to wearisomeness. Unlike some of the sensationalism</page><page sequence="38">BENJA MIN FRANKLIN FISHER IV / 279 committed, say, under the guise of full biographical study of Byron, Graves's treatment of his subject's homosexuality is steady and low-key. Housman's own papers furnish undeniable information about his assignations with other homosexuals, and the employment of those documents here is almost the sole surprise of this book. More no-nonsense portraiture occurs in discussions of AEH's relationships with Clemence and Laurence, to whom their elder sibling was often not brotherly, if by that term we mean close or cordial. His preference for uttermost privacy in his personal comings and goings often elicited unfavorable responses, and these came not just from his relatives; witness those of Max Beerbohm (p. 116). The Housman who was an aloof, unapproachable professor at Cambridge is emphasized; he was, to be sure, no trained seal as a classroom teacher. Given that his own bent was toward textual study and editing, it is no surprise that his performances were not lauded by the many. Yet there are accounts of his stature as a teacher and of his kindliness toward students who unwittingly visited him. Then there is the evident devilish wit and humor of the Leslie Stephen Lecture, published as The Name and Nature of Poetry. His pointed teasing about composition of his own verse, coupled with the deliberate destruction of the germane portions of his notebook, betray a waggish side. So do the nonsense verses, some of them still unpublished. Although more widely remembered because of their scathing denunciations of sub-standard "scholarship," his classical papers do reveal a gentler comic sense, as does his lecture on Swinburne, delivered originally to the Literary Society at the University of London. One must also not forget Housman's letters, used deftly by Graves, because they frequently betray a comic spirit otherwise muted. The poetry is given just, if terse, dues. The use of the exile, Terence Hearsay - modelled perhaps on the classical Terence, who came to Rome a slave - is grounded in Housman's own self-image at the time he composed many of the poems for A Shropshire Lad. Graves also makes clear that emotion of a universal nature rather than that felt for Moses Jackson alone pervades these poems and makes them last. They constitute one of the last great Victorian-Edwardian outcries against an indifferent, and consequently ironically lovely natural world. They simultaneously indicate a quest after certainty that is both futile and noble. History of publication and reception of Housman's poems is given because it measures the author's attitude toward his work. Housman demanded that low prices be charged in order to keep circulation high. This wish he attributed to vanity, but it is a tribute to his wisdom that since 1896 his verse has remained in print. If cavils sound because Graves includes no more literary criticism than he does, he may be justified because of the really brief interludes of literary activity in Housman's long, busy life. After all, Housman was nothing if</page><page sequence="39">280/ VICTORIAN POETRY not "Victorian" in his working at classical scholarship, and that work allowed little time for other pursuits. The notebooks support this suggestion. Furthermore, Housman's typical mode of expression was terse, and so his lyrics required no great time for completion and polish. Graves's own terse chapters provide what others have more expansively furnished in the way of criticism. Housman himself would doubtless approve the methods of this spokesman. Swinburne Robert A. Greenberg Of the several works I shall be discussing, two merit special attention: David G. Riede's critical study, Swinburne: A Study of Romantic Mythmaking (1978), and William B. Ober's lengthy biographical essay, "Swinburne's Masochism: Neuropathology and Psychopathology" (in Ober, Boswell's Clap and Other Essays). Though radically different in method and focus, both formulate the presence of a basic controlling pattern in Swinburne's life or career and ask us in turn to revise certain generally accepted views. Riede's concern is with the poet's inner imaginative life, as manifest in the poetry apart from the specifics of biography. The pattern he traces assimilates Swinburne to a common Victorian sequence, beginning in despair, progressing to a kind of quietus, and ending (surprisingly for Swinburne) in affirmation. Implied in this pattern is another, alluded to in Riede's title, which shows Swinburne moving from traditional uses of established myth (as in Atalanta in Calydon, the Proserpine poems) to the creation of original mythopoeic poetry commencing in the late 1 870's ("On the Cliffs") and extending well into his life at The Pines ("A Nympholept," "The Lake of Gaube"). Only by freeing his imagination of the myths of others, creating his own mythic structures, could Swinburne achieve the integrated vision evident in a number of his later poems. Riede admires these poems, in keeping with recent reassessments, and seems indeed to rate them higher than much of the earlier work. Thus, what has usually been seen as Swinburne's period of decline becomes, in Riede's argument (supported by several close explications), a period of particular and significant triumphs. On the whole, this is a provocative study which may be usefully read along with an earlier essay in these pages, touching upon similar ideas, by Robert A. Greenberg, "Swinburne and the Redefinition of Classical Myth" (VP, 1976).</page><page sequence="40">ROBERT A. GREEN BERG / 281 Ober's essay, one often or so on literary figures in Boswell's Clap, is a carefully ordered effort to establish a physiological basis for the poet's masochism and probable sexual impotence. Ober argues that "Swinburne's psychopathology had its root in neuropathology," caused by "anoxic brain damage incurred at birth, and that his masochism and other abnormal behavior developed as a psychological overlay." Demonstrating the presence of brain damage 150 years after birth is, as the author is aware, a speculative undertaking at best, demanding a judicious use of evidence. As neuropathological symptoms, he points to such well-established facts as the poet's hyperkinetic behavior, his tics, spasms, and choreiform movements, as well as to evidence of disgraphia, arrested hydrocephalus, and catalepsy- all suggestive of natal brain damage. Assuming that damage, Ober then considers such "modifying factors" in Swinburne's development as his family context (including his relations with Mary Gordon), his "environment" at Eton and Oxford, and his later peer and literary friendships. Finally, he discusses the flagellatory and sadomasochistic verse that Swinburne produced in mid-life. All in all, this is a complex enterprise to manage in the forty-five pages Ober allows himself, and inevitably questions and qualifications come to mind. The result, however, is a suggestive, essentially credible portrait that puts the familiar (e.g., Swinburne's vulnerability to liquor) in a new light and accounts in fresh terms for a recurrent strain in the poetry. Readers of Donald Thomas' Swinburne: The Poet in his World, expecting from its title the first phenomenological study of the poet, will be disappointed. We get rather the standard biographical fare, largely a run- through of familiar anecdotes, with occasional infusions of social history intended to constitute the poet's "world." Here and there the combination is enlightening (Swinburne's youthful climb of Culver Cliff is associated with the beginning Victorian craze for mountain climbing), but Thomas has no fresh conception that he is working out, little that is really new to offer. Worst of all, he is astonishingly insensitive when dealing with Swinburne's poetry after 1866, and seems indeed at a loss to find adequate terms of discussion of either a critical or biographical nature. New Swinburne letters surface and come into print without, however, substantially modifying our sense of his life or works. The fourteen presented in Terry L. Meyers, "Further Swinburne Letters" (N&amp;Q 26:3 13- 320), run from 1864 to 1889 and are of varying length and interest. The most affecting, dated May 6, 1870, is to D. G. Rossetti, reassuring him of Swinburne's high estimate of Rossetti's Poems, an estimate he intends to broadcast in his forthcoming essay for the Fortnightly Review. Swinburne's generosity was never more evident than in this episode, both in helping to get the volume out and in propagandizing its virtues.</page><page sequence="41">282/ VICTORIAN POETRY Of Swinburne's early works, Atalanta in Calydon continues to draw most attention. Riede provides a detailed analysis, emphasizing elements of strife and division, as part of the argument in his Swinburne. Jean Watson Rosenbaum's "Of Hunts and Hunters: Atalanta in Calydon" (PRR 3:41-53) sees in the hunt motif the desire for an ordered human existence, which is achieved in the play in societal terms (the killing of the boar), but not in individual personal terms. The pursuit itself, however, if truly undertaken, is for Swinburne a sufficient triumph in a world hostile to human order and consequence. The hunt is of another order in John S. Mayfield's "A Swinburne Collector in Calydon" (Quarterly Journal of the Library of Congress 37 [Winter 1980]: 25-34), which chronicles some of the adventures and textual discoveries of Mayfield's thirty-five year pursuit of first editions of Atalanta. Our foremost Swinburne collector, Mayfield has 101 copies at hand. Tennyson Joseph Sendry The year's work for 1979 recalls A. Dwight Culler's comments on the Alexandrian school from the third century B. C. These "learned and sophisticated poets . . . writing for a highly cultivated audience in the great research center of Alexandria" despaired of repeating the achievements of their mighty epic and tragic predecessors and so confined themselves to shorter forms and if not always to new themes, then to novel or little known slants on the old ones. Like all analogies this one is only approximately true, for it is not at all clear that the heroic age of Tennyson scholarship is over. On the contrary, from reports of various studies in progress, we can confidently expect that some work of noble note may, indeed will, yet be done. In the past year, however, the most important thinking on the poet found expression in shorter or at least middle-length forms of scholarly discourse: long articles, short books, chapters from books, and a monograph. The aggregate (especially that portion of it represented by books) was ample in quantity and, on the whole, sophisticated and specialized in quality. Thus, rather than focusing on the poet himself, the biographical studies centered on his relation to groups of persons in his life: the undergraduate circle of which Arthur Hallam was the most important member and the businessmen who brought out his books. Bibliographical</page><page sequence="42">JOSEPH SENDR Y / 283 work comprised textual histories of three poems, rather than - for example - new scholarly editions. Critical work took mostly limited, often unusual, perspectives on such perennial questions as Tennyson's relation to the nineteenth-century literary milieu and his consciousness of time and history or, in one case, a broad, frontal perspective on a neglected area of the canon, the plays. For various logistic reasons (one being that issues of periodicals and books whose copyright pages bear dates from one year sometimes do not appear until the next) this survey of 1979 scholarship contains some work dated 1978. By the same token, material dated 1979 (a book by Robert Pattison entitled Tennyson and Tradition, for one) may receive belated notice in next year's survey. Thanks largely to a special Spring issue of Studies in Romanticism devoted to Victorian Romanticism, Tennyson's relation to the preceding literary generation was a major topic of discussion in 1979. By far the most important contribution was Margaret Lourie's opening article, "Below the Thunders of the Upper Deep: Tennyson as Romantic Revisionist" (18:3- 27). The discussion is pursued in the same issue by Pauline Fletcher's "Romantic and Anti-Romantic Gardens in Tennyson and Swinburne" (pp. 81-97) and in VP by James J. Sherry's "Tennyson: The Paradox of the Sign" (17:204-216). In treating Tennyson as heir to the Romantics, the three pieces show surprising agreement in their selection of poems for analysis, early work mostly from the 1830 and 1832 volumes. Both Lourie and Fletcher consider "Recollections of the Arabian Nights," "Mariana," "The Poet," "The Lady of Shalott,"and"The Palace of Art. "In addition to "Mariana," Sherry deals with "Break, Break, Break." Lourie's is an influence study with a difference: it glances forward to the vision of Romanticism that Tennyson transmitted to the later Victorians when it is not at its principal job of scrutinizing his own adaptations of Keats and, especially, of Shelley. From Keats Lourie sees Tennyson appropriating language and sensuous decor; from Shelley - and here she develops a "consciousness" approach to good advantage - inwardness and "a method of projecting mental processes onto the external world." The opening line of "The Kraken," which gives the article the first half of its title, indicates the nature of the revisionism referred to in the second half. Whereas Shelley turned inward to discover man's relation to the ideal and Keats, to recover the external world of objects, Tennyson's introversion led him to fathom more primitive layers of the psyche - juvenile fantasy in "Recollections of the Arabian Nights" and ^dult eroticism in "Mariana." "The Lady of Shalott" and "The Palace of Art" find Tennyson at once attracted and repelled by this turn toward solipsism, a spell he is able to break only by peremptorily treating a psychological problem as a moral one. In "Tithon" the attractions of inward isolation reassert themselves, but only temporarily, for the solution imposed in "The</page><page sequence="43">284 / VICTORIAN POETRY Palace of Art" (re-entering the world as a matter of obligation) directs Tennyson's subsequent work away from Romanticism. The gesture was "prototypical" for later Victorian poets, though some like the Pre- Raphaelites reoccupied the solitary mental chambers Tennyson had vacated, decorating them, as he had, with Keatsian imagery. Concentrating on the single image of the garden, Pauline Fletcher also uses a turn from society as the test of Tennyson's Romanticism and traces (though with less richness of implication) the same basic development in his career that Lourie does. The garden as escapist retreat in the work of 1830 and 1832 gives way to an ambiguous setting in The Princess, to a symbol of conflict between Romantic and social values in Maud, and finally to "a model for the ideal society" in the second "Locksley Hall." James J. Sherry, on the other hand, thinks that readings of Tennyson as a Romantic - the kind that Lourie and Fletcher employ when they take landscape to symbolize states of mind - as well as readings in a New Critical vein fail to accommodate the complexity of Tennyson's style and the paradoxical view of language that underlies it. "Words," said the poet in In Memoriam, "half reveal / And half conceal." Though suggestive, Sherry's presentation of this question is too abbreviated to be useful in critical analysis. Moreover, Tennyson's reflections on the limitations of language to convey meaning are discussed at more length and in more depth in F. E. L. Priestley's 1973 book, which Sherry does not cite. Peter Allen's The Cambridge Apostles: The Early Years deserves notice for the detailed look that it takes at the intellectual milieu in which the poet lived as an undergraduate. Documented copiously from new manuscript material in addition to published sources, Allen's book gives the early history of the student debating society named in the title largely by sketching the personalities of the dominant - and some of the minor - figures who were active from its founding in 1820 to the middle of the next decade and (more briefly) beyond, as these individuals made their way in the world and reassembled in such London-based successor groups as the Sterling Club and the Metaphysical Society. Allen focuses on F. D. Maurice and Arthur Hallam as the guiding spirits of the society during the late 1820's and the early 1830's respectively. The information that Allen has uncovered will require some refinement of commonly held opinion. For example, Tennyson's relation to the Apostles, though of major significance, was more through friendship with its members than through attendance at their weekly meetings, at which the poet appears to have been present only five times during the four months he was in the society. Allen shows that these young men shared less a set of ideas than an outlook: antagonism to the highly competitive, rigid system of rote learning then prevailing at Cambridge coupled with a willingness to learn from persons holding opposing views. The group's intellectual openness was founded on</page><page sequence="44">JOSEPH SEN DRY / 285 a common belief that an idea is a product not simply of the mind but of the whole personality and its wider experience. Arthur Hallam's adherence to this principle, which implies a primary role for intuition and feeling in the discovery of truth, figures again in Philip Flynn's article, "Hallam and Tennyson: The Theodicea Novissima' and In Memoriam" (SEL 19:705-720). Flynn's major focus is on what he sees as Tennyson's inability to accept, until several years after Hallam's death, even the general terms of a solution to the problem of evil that Hallam had expounded in "Theodicea Novissima," an essay he presented before the Apostles. From the Biblical teaching that God is love Hallam arrived at the peculiar deduction that moral evil is necessary so that Christ, by overcoming it, could realize his own divinity and thus become capable of reciprocating God's love. Flynn is much better on exposing Hallam's position than on tracking Tennyson's poetic reaction to it. Relying for his dating on Eleanor Bustin Mattes' In Memoriam: The Way of A Soul (published in 1951 before the Lincoln and Trinity manuscripts were available for study) he pinpoints the key shift in Tennyson's attitude toward the problem of evil at Section CXIV, which "records his acceptance of a crucial epistemological distinction between Wisdom and Knowledge, a position reached apparently by 1839 through the influence of Carlyle" among others. That distinction had been reached and used seven years earlier by Tennyson himself in "Hail Briton," a stanza of which he reused to begin the section. (Mrs. Mattes, who cited a parallel passage in Carlyle's Miscellanies, published in 1839, admitted [p. 121] that she had "no certain evidence" that CXIV had been composed in that year.) Flynn could have found in Ricks's edition that the section appears in neither the Trinity nor the Lincoln manuscript, which absence suggests a much later dating than 1839. Manuscript evidence is now regularly invoked in critical as well as historical work on Tennyson. Three recent studies, two from last year and one from 1978, concentrate on the manuscripts themselves. My article, "/a? Memoriam: The Minor Manuscripts" (HLB 27:36-64), examines shorter items, by my count twenty-three in number, most of which will be familiar by name through Ricks's notes, none of which contains more than a fraction of the material in the Trinity and Lincoln "butcher's books." The aim of the article was to establish the sequence in which these documents are related to each other and to the two major manuscripts, and also to define stages in the composition of In Memoriam (admittedly partial and discontinuous) as revealed by this evidence. The minor manuscripts fall into three principal groups. Six, dating from Hallam's death to early 1835, identify the earliest sections and show the poet (his contrary statement in the Memoir notwithstanding) beginning almost at once to link individual lyrics in a triad comprising IX, XVII, and XVIII. Seven pieces from 1837 to</page><page sequence="45">286/ VICTORIAN POETRY 1839 or 1840 (that is, to an early stage in the Trinity manuscript, from which some were apparently removed) show Tennyson testing ways to organize the accumulating sections. A third group consists of six items, none earlier than 1848, each representing an intended insertion of one or two sections prior to some stage of printing. The remaining four are transcriptions in as many hands. Besides facilitating use of the documents concerned, the findings presented in the article should permit us to speak with somewhat more precision about the composition of In Memoriam and to proceed with greater confidence in working with the Trinity and Lincoln manuscripts. A recent development concerning the latter calls for mention here. The sale of Tennyson materials at Sotheby's on July 22, 1980, included the Lincoln manuscript. For the results of the sale and the fate of the manuscript, see Susan Shatto's report elsewhere in this journal (pp. 309-312). Philip Gaskell, Librarian of Trinity College and therefore the person with principal responsibility for the earlier major manuscript of In Memoriam, has made available eleven versions, from the first draft to the latest edition supervised by the poet, of thirty-two lines from another of Tennyson's much-revised poems, "Oenone." As his sixth case study (pp. 118-141) in From Writer to Reader: Studies in Editorial Method (1978), Gaskell reproduces in facsimile the passage as it appeared in three editions: as first published in 1832, as transformed in the 1 842 volumes, and with the author's final corrections in 1883. Facsimiles of five manuscripts (with typescripts provided for legibility on facing pages) trace the stages in which Tennyson reworked the text during the "ten years' silence." These are augmented at one end of the text's history by a notebook version from 1830-32 along with a transcript from the same period and at the other end by the relevant page from the (1969) Ricks edition, which is judged exemplary. Gaskell's helpfully informative, relatively brief commentary is chiefly concerned with the craft of editing (the book is intended for use in bibliography courses), but the materials are so presented as to provide maximum convenience for the critically inclined reader who wishes to study the poet's craftsmanship at close range. Ricks himself, in collaboration with another distinguished Tennyson scholar, Edgar F. Shannon, Jr., has produced just such a study of the poet's craftsmanship through bibliographical evidence, "A Further History of Tennyson's Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington: The Manuscript at Trinity College and the Galley Proof at Lincoln" (SB 32:125-157). Trinity Notebook 25, which contains several draftings, is the only full manuscript of the ode and, aside from a few fragments at Harvard, the earliest. The most important feature of the galley sheets at Lincoln is the author's autograph corrections. The two documents are singled out in this</page><page sequence="46">JOSEPH SEN DRY / 287 article because they became available for scholarly use only after previous work on the subject by each of the investigators: an article by Shannon published in 1960 ("The History of a Poem: Tennyson's Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington" SB 13:149-177) and Ricks's 1969 Longmans edition, pp. 1007-17. Shannon and Ricks's joint essay divides into two parts. The first confirms conclusions reached earlier by Shannon: that the reviewers moved Tennyson to revision only when their criticism corresponded with his own "maturing sense of things." Such revisions appear to have been made in connection with four themes (Wellington as soldier and statesman, his interment, Englishness and patriotism, and "the religious note"). The new evidence shows that the direction taken in each of these four categories was set before publication, hence before the reviews. In its second half the essay concentrates on four aspects of the poem (metaphors, ambiguities, questions, and names), where the new documentation reveals Tennyson making stylistic improvements independent of the reviewers. An appendix includes a bibliographical description of both items and a comprehensive collation of substantive variants. This double-authored production succeeds on two levels: as an impressive work of textual scholarship and as a sensitive piece of literary criticism. If in revising a text, as Shannon has argued, Tennyson gave priority to his own judgment over that of the reviewers, in issuing the text to the public he was guided more by aesthetic than by commercial values. Such is the picture that emerges from June Steffensen Hagen's Tennyson and His Publishers, an account of the poet's dealings with the men who produced his books in a publishing career that spanned more than six decades: J. and J. Jackson, Effingham Wilson, Edward Moxon, Alexander Strahan, Henry S. King, Charles Kegan Paul, and Alexander Macmillan along with some lesser lights. Besides providing personal sketches of the principals, Hagen chronicles their agreements and conflicts with Tennyson on such matters as contracts, royalties, advertising, sales, format, illustrations, and the like. The poet's fidelity to his artistic conscience did not inhibit the exercise of his business instinct, and so the second half of the book reads like the success story that it is, with sales figures and profits precisely recorded for each edition as it reaches the booksellers. Hagen's book suffers from a curious split. More than half of the text (pp. 21-118) covers the years of Tennyson's association with Edward Moxon and his firm (1832-69) - a business connection of longer duration than those that the poet maintained with all other houses combined and a personal tie such as he enjoyed with only one other publisher, Alexander Macmillan. Hagen reports that Moxon "left no diary, very few personal letters, no business journal, no memoir or autobiography" and that "much correspondence and all accounts with Moxon &amp; Co. after Edward's death,</page><page sequence="47">288/ VICTORIAN POETRY that is from 1858 to 1868, were lost in the fires of World War II." The story that should occupy the center of the book can therefore be given only in outline, which is then filled in with familiar material on the poet's biography, his methods of composition, and the reception of his work - some critical comment thrown in for good measure. Even this material is not always reliably presented. In a major portion of the second chapter, for example, the author assigns Edward FitzGerald the role of successor to Hallam as Tennyson's chief literary advisor, ignoring James Spedding, whom - setting aside other evidence - the trial issue of the Memoir names specifically in this capacity. Since documentation on the publishers after Moxon becomes far more abundant, Hagen's account of those years is correspondingly fuller and more sharply focused. But the poet's transactions with these men were restricted almost entirely to business matters, with the result that the telling is best where the tale is least. Hagen had the material for a good monograph and stretched it into a flawed, uneven book. Dennis M. Organ wrote a good monograph: Tennyson's Dramas: A Critical Study, published by Texas Tech University in its Graduate Studies series. Beginning as Hagen does with a minor theme in Tennyson scholarship, Organ wisely limits his focus to Tennyson's seven dramas as literary, as distinct from theatrical, art. Within that range he further confines himself to a few questions that define the distinctive character and the aesthetic success or failure of each play. Some of these are the use of dramatic subgenres (the chronicle play, for example, leads Tennyson into a clutter of historical detail in Queen Mary, sl defect that is corrected in the streamlined Harold); psychology of characterization (Edgar in The Promise of May is seen as "a victim of his philosophies as well as a manipulator of them"); and the relation of symbol and imagery to dramatic action (as in The Cup, the hunt imagery applied to Synorix's rapacious pursuit of the virtuous Camma is counterpointed by her association with Artemis, goddess of the hunt). Organ's prose style is a good measure of the quality of the work in general: it is as lucid as it is economical. His work is economical in another way, an important one in these days when university libraries can no longer afford every scholarly publication that comes off the presses: it sells for considerably less than any of the hard-cover titles reviewed here. A last group of studies awaiting consideration views Tennyson's work in broad historical, even trans-historical perspectives. Two of these concern In Memoriam: the third chapter of Carl Dawson's Victorian Noon: English Literature in 1850 and an essay published by Gerald L. Bruns in 1978, "The Lesser Faith': Hope and Reversal in Tennyson's In Memoriam" (JEGP 77:247-264). The "spaces" referred to in the title of Margaret Homans' essay on the Idylls of the King, "Tennyson and the Spaces of Life" (ELH 46:693-709), exist on several levels, two of the</page><page sequence="48">JOSEPH SEN DRY / 289 principal ones being those between human origins and human ends and those in a human lifetime where an individual like Arthur creates an identity "amidst the surrounding chaos of history" which threatens to reduce him to a mere unit in a series of kings. Finally, as its title suggests, Henry Kozicki's book Tennyson and Clio is devoted entirely to the poet's idea of history. Victorian Noon deals in revealing detail with the literary situation in the single year that marked the middle of the century and, in Tennyson's life, publication of In Memoriam, marriage, and assumption of the laureateship. Dawson describes the organization of his book as grouping "well-known or representative works and . . . discuss[ing] them in terms of contemporary responses, historical circumstances, and pertinent traditions or parallels." Where In Memoriam is concerned, the "contemporary responses" took contrary forms. Some observers doubted that the private, introspective quality of Tennyson's work could secure him any widespread appeal. On the other hand, In Memoriam, which incorporates this very quality, proved an immediate popular success. One "historical circumstance" in the reception of the poem was the admiration Dante had gained as one who made of poetic autobiography, in the phrase of a critic writing in 1850, an "epos of the soul." The Divine Comedy thus helped to create a climate in which two poetic autobiographies published that year, Tennyson's and Wordsworth's, could be read as having philosophical, historic, indeed epic significance despite and (thanks to Dante's example) even because of the idiosyncratic personal material they included. Though its abstraction sets it off from the concreteness of Dawson's chapter, Bruns's article on In Memoriam resembles it - and the other studies now being considered- in the stress that it lays on external context rather than internal analysis as a way of understanding the poem. In brief, the article attempts to find in certain modern thinkers - Niebuhr, Eliade, Marcel, Ricoeur, and especially Merleau-Ponty- concepts that will make sense of the disjunctions and apparent contradictions in Tennyson's poem. Bruns's point of departure is the profound discrepancy between "All is well" and the spectacle of historical devastation (on which Hallam looks, smiling) that follows it in CXXVII. In Bruns's terms temporal experience shows history to be cyclical, with destruction a regular part of its pattern and terror an inevitable accompanying emotion. To counter this view the poet forms an idea of history as the linear development of providential design (hence "All is well"). Bruns believes that the conflict between these two outlooks is never resolved. Rather, through the apocalyptic terror of CXXVII, it is transferred from a realm where explanations apply to one where they are replaced by mystery. In this latter realm terror becomes "part of the hiddenness of time's sacred meaning," virtually a pre-condition of hope. The "reversal" in Bruns's title refers to the poet's "return . . . upon</page><page sequence="49">290/ VICTORIAN POETRY his own thinking," a puzzling phrase that I take to mean a shift from one kind of thought to another, that is from mental constructions that attempt to resolve issues to "dialectic," which (as expounded by Merleau-Ponty) seeks to experience contrarieties in their unpredictable concreteness. Bruns brings this sense of "dialectic" to bear also on the basic problem of In Memoriam criticism, the relation of the individual sections to a single whole, which he describes as "adjacency" rather than "consistency." Urging that the poem be approached from an awareness of its discontinuities, he steers away not only from aesthetic interpretations but even from those that view it in terms of "process," the meandering course of the speaker's mental development. Thus Bruns questions the use of one lyric of In Memoriam to interpret another, a procedure that he calls "conventional exegesis." The achievement as well as the limits of the study are suggested by these assumptions. By invoking categories of modern thought Bruns illuminates certain major cruxes in the poem, rescuing these from charges of fatuity, incoherence, or complacency and giving them a claim to interest and intellectual respectability. At the same time, his analysis is confined almost exclusively to the last quarter of In Memoriam, and within that quarter mainly to two lyrics, CXXVII and CXXVIII. Especially in light of his insistence that what holds for one part of the poem cannot be assumed to hold for another, it is fair to observe that Bruns leaves us with three quarters of the elegy unaccounted for. "Space" in Margaret Homans' "Tennyson and the Spaces of Life" can be paraphrased roughly as "room in which to establish identity." Homans finds this concept operating at several key levels in the Idylls of the King. For Arthur it is the interstice between origin and destiny, both figured in Merlin's rhyme as "the great deep" that threatens to engulf human selfhood. Arthur's institution of the Round Table is seen as an act of self- creation, a bid to secure identity by filling the space between origin and end. The knights repeat his act by attempting, as in the Grail quest, to create their own identities over against the ones that the king imposed on them. On a rhetorical level, the act of figuration makes space by clearing away the overdeterminateness of literalism. Arthur practices such figuration, and so does the poet as he produces his own figurations upon Wordsworth's figurations in The Prelude (1850, IX. 1-9), which Homans appears to take as the sole origin of Tennyson's "great deep." Such interpretations caused the poet to lament (often, his son tells us in the Memoir), "They have taken my hobby and ridden it too hard." Though deftly handled - at least until it loses itself in the Forest of Figuration, located deep within the demesnes of the Yale School - this allegory of Identity ultimately doomed in its struggle against Oblivion is ridden as hard as any hobby the poet is likely to have encountered.</page><page sequence="50">JOSEPH SEN DRY / 291 The most ambitious work from 1979 is Henry Kozicki's Tennyson and Clio. For Kozicki Clio is "the muse of meaningful history," the last term taken to mean the philosophy of history rather than the study of historical data and "meaning" taken to imply a conceptual system accompanied by intense conviction. Kozicki traces the development of Tennyson's historical thinking through six stages based on successive recombinations of three ideas: God, history, and man. Reduced to the barest outline the six stages are these: a cyclical, providentially guided rise and fall of states; second, a differentiation developed at Cambridge and after (1827-1833) between active providence, involving social progress but the diminution of the hero, and ordinary providence or natural process; third, adherence to the progressive aspect of phase two in the English idyls and The Princess, where the Great House symbolizes continuity between past and present; fourth, the discarding of the Biblical eschatology of phase one and the secular progressivism of phase three and their replacement in In Memoriam with the speaker's assuming a collective identity as he creates meaning amid cyclical devastations (of the kind described by Bruns); fifth, increasing anarchy into which human agents (in Maud, the political poems of the 1850's, and at length in the Idylls) can still bring the temporary realization of ideals; and sixth, anarchy beyond redemption by human agents who in "Lucretius" and other poems of the 1860's become morbid and suicidal. Kozicki finds Tennyson in the last two decades of his career disengaging himself from history and hence abandoning Clio. An uneasiness that I feel to some extent about the ad hoc conceptual systems devised by Bruns and Homans, which are controlled by virtue of their application to limited aspects of the poetry, becomes a major reservation in Kozicki's work where the application extends across Tennyson's career. I find the general argument of his book unconvincing for several reasons: an over-readiness to mix ideas from the most disparate nineteenth- and twentieth-century sources and to assume that - where the former are concerned - Tennyson did so as well; an overschematization of the ideas thus assembled; and recurrent distortion of the poems to fit the conceptual scheme. Kozicki himself proposes that the scheme be tested on "Timbuctoo" and "The Hesperides." In both I find his interpretations skewed by making subordinate elements into major cruxes. In "Timbuctoo" what may be an earthquake occurs in a simile used to illustrate the enduring life that things such as ruined cities have in the imagination. Kozicki extracts that situation from the simile, links it with a deserted temple from the speaker's subsequent vision, and arrives* at a reading in which Timbuctoo is destroyed in an earthquake by an affronted providence. Similarly, in "The Hesperides," by giving priority to the 13-line frame rather than to the 103-line song, he has the poem center on Hanno's</page><page sequence="51">292 / VICTORIAN POETRY failure to respond to the apples, as "anthropomorphic symbols of transcendence." On other poems, however, Kozicki can be fresh and interesting, especially in his treatment of the obsolescence of heroism in "Ulysses" and other work of that period; on the medieval ideal embodied in the English idyls and The Princess; in the Idylls of the King generally; and on a theme (sensuality and asceticism as symptoms of social breakdown) that he finds the Idylls to share with "Lucretius." This is a book that invites argument, and for now I have argued enough.</page></plain_text>
