Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1987. Pp. xxii, 254, incl. 50 b/w plates, 11 color plates, 53 figures. $65.00. ISBN 0-4721 -0067-X. This well illustrated and lavishly produced volume, targeted at as broad a lay and professional audience as possible, is by far the most detailed study of the marble figural sculpture of the Cycladic Early Bronze Age. After a brief summary of the cultural history of the Early Cycladic (EC) period and the typology of its marble anthropomorphic figures, Getz-Preziosi poses the three essential questions around which the book is centered. First, how is the EC sculptural tradition to be defined in terms of its toolkit, the proportions and angles favored in the designs of its figures, and the ranges of their plastic, incised, and painted details? Second, how within the span of 25 to 30 generations during which this highly formulaic tradition is estimated to have flourished is the hand of the individual sculptor to be identified? And finally, was the craft of carving these early marble sculptures particularly at home on just a few of the numerous islands which form the central Aegean archipel- ago, and if so, on which ones? The bulk of the study consists of sketches of sixteen EC "sculptors" exemplifying the ranges in form, quality, and quantity of artistic output from the 40 or more craft specialists whose work the author claims to be able to recognize in two or more surviving figures. Though her arguments in favor of identifying selected groups of between 3 and over 50 marble figures as representative of individual artistic hands are cumulatively persuasive, illus- trated by copious photographs and a number of helpful line drawings, they are not wholly convincing because the author has not appreciated the full extent of the problem of identifying individual artists in prehistoric settings or taken advantage of the growing body of theoretical literature on the subject [e.g., B. A. Nelson (ed.), Decoding Prehistoric Ceramics (Carbondale 1985)] and has not demonstrated that-and how-the work of the 16 "sculptors," individually and as a group, is sharply differentiable from the mass of unattributed EC sculpture of the same figural type. Both weaknesses of the author's overall case might be mitigated by greater quantification of the variability in the data, particularly in such readily quantifiable features as proportions and compositional angles (the author's "Harmonic System") within the work of a given "sculptor." Such reservations notwithstanding, this is a major contribution to the scholarship on Aegean prehistoric art in general and on the emergence of specialized artisans in particular.
