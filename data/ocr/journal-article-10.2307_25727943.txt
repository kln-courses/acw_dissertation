<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vision and Ascension: Surat al-Najm and its Relationship with Muhammad's mfraj 1 Josef van Ess UNIVERSITY OF TUBINGEN Ascension to Heaven is something Jesus and Muhammad, or the religious imagery of Christianity and Islam, have in common. But the differences are perhaps more profound than the similarities. In Christianity, Jesus's ascension is the logical conse quence of resurrection. The Qur'an, on the contrary, does not talk about resurrection; Jesus is raised to Heaven immediately from the cross without having died upon it. When Muhammad ascended to Heaven he did not abide there; he returned to earth. Jesus had finished his earthly mission and he had apparently failed; when he went up to Heaven this was to show that, in spite of his crucifixion, he belonged to the realm of God. Muhammad's ascension, however, stood at the beginning of his career; he was, on this occasion, initiated into his task, a task the success of which was evident to everybody in his community. We should not forget that only in Western languages is the term 'ascension' applied to both events; in Arabic there is a verbal difference between Muhammad who experienced his mfrdj and Jesus who was raised to Heaven, rafacahu 'llahu ilayhi, as the Qur'an says (4:158; cf.3:55). No Muslim ever compared Muhammad to Jesus in this respect. This fact leaps all the more to the eye since com parisons as such were not avoided, at least not during the earliest phase of Islam; they are reflected in hadith. But they refer to other prophets and they are based on genu inely Qur'anic ideas: Abraham, it was said, was the friend of God (khalil Allah), Mo ses was spoken to by God, at Mount Sinai (he is dubbed kalim Allah) and Muhammad, finally, was the one to ascend to Heaven and to see God in person. This is more than a comparison, it is a climax: intimacy with God (Abraham), hearing Him (Moses), see ing Him. A climax which presented the case in a new form, but also had its own problems. I do not want to discuss here the micrdj stories as such. One related aspect has to be stressed, though. Muhammad does not abide in Heaven. He is not reunited with God after having temporarily been sent to earth by him; he only meets God, in an audience. And this audience has a specific purpose: God tells him how many prayers his commu nity should perform per day. In the beginning the Almighty is quite demanding; he mentions the number of fifty prayers. Muhammad has to bargain with Him and he manages to get the number down to five. This reminds us of the scene described in the Old Testament where Abraham bargains, in a similar way, with respect to the few</page><page sequence="2">48 Journal of Qur'anic Studies righteous living at Sodom and Gomorrah whom God should spare when 'He rained' on these towns 'stones of baked clay' as described in the Qur'an (11:82). But it is Moses who advises Muhammad to proceed in this way, Moses whom he has met during his journey through the spheres which he performs under Gabriel's guidance. Moses and Abraham are the last two prophets whom he passes by, those who are closest to God in their cosmic relevance - and those who were compared with him in the rhetorical climax mentioned above. We can imagine how fascinating these stories were for the audience of their time. But they had one disadvantage: none of this was at first glance to be found in the Scripture itself. If anything, the Qur'an offered only one vague allusion to it, in sura 70 where God is called the 'Lord of the Stairways (or Ladder)', dhu yl-maQdrij and where the text then continues: 'To Him the angels and the Spirit mount up in a day whereof the measure is fifty thousand years'. But this did not fit; Muhammad was not mentioned there. Therefore the exegetes had to pursue their search and in the course of time they came up with two other passages which seemed to allude to the event. The first one was the beginning of sura 17, an isolated verse again which, devoid of any further explanation, remained cryptic in many respects: 'Glory be to Him, who carried His servant (Muhammad as it seems) by night from the Holy Place of Worship (probably at Mecca) to the Further Place of Worship the precincts of which we have blessed, that we might show him some of Our signs.' 'Some of our signs': this could refer to mi raculous experiences Muhammad had had on his journey in Heaven, possibly the en counter with God Himself. The 'precincts' which had been blessed by God evoked, because of other Qur'anic passages, the image of the Holy Land. Therefore many people started speculating early on whether the 'Further Place of Worship', which was accompanied by this epithet, might possibly be Jerusalem. Already in the first century AH, Jerusalem was graced with a mosque on the precincts of the former Salomonic Temple, a mosque which was identified with the 'Further Place of Worship' and named after it: al-Masjid al-Aqsd. Muhammad had - this was the result of all these combinations - miraculously traveled by night to Jerusalem. However, this could not yet be called ascension. He remained on the surface of the earth; he had moved horizontally, not vertically. It is true that he had reached the place from where Jesus had ascended to Heaven. But the Muslims did not want to compare him to Jesus in this respect, as we have seen. Let us therefore look first at the second passage. This second Qur'anic testimony was longer, though almost as equivocal as the first. Its importance lay in the fact that it seemed to give a description of Muhammad's encoun ter with God. For, at the beginning of sura 53, the Qur'an reports two visions which the Prophet had had at a certain time. These are quite unusual texts, since normally according to the Qur'an Muhammad does not see God, but listens to him. The Qur'an presents itself - or is understood - as the account of auditory experiences; this is how the revelation normally takes place. In this instance the situation is different. We will</page><page sequence="3">Vision and Ascension 49 begin by examining this passage from Arberry's translation, although its wording contains certain preliminary decisions which I shall have to cancel afterwards: 'By the Star when it plunges, your comrade (the person meant seems to be Muhammad him self) is not astray, neither errs, nor speaks he out of caprice. This is naught but a revela tion revealed, taught him by one terrible in power, very strong; he stood poised, being on the higher horizon, then drew near and suspended hung, two bows'-length away, or nearer, then revealed to his servant that he revealed. His heart lies not of what he saw ...' and, immediately afterwards, the report concerning the second vision: 'Indeed, he saw him come down another time by the Lote-Tree of the Boundary nigh which is the Garden of the Refuge, when there covered the Lote-Tree that which covered; his eye swerved not, nor swept astray. Indeed, he saw one of the greatest signs of his Lord.' Again a 'sign of the Lord', similar to the sign the Prophet was promised to be shown at the 'Further Place of Worship'; this is what may have brought both passages together. The location remained even vaguer than in the first case. But the two visions them selves are described in a thought-provoking way. Strangely enough the report is made in the third person. People could think that God Himself was speaking; He seemed to disclose a secret which, apart from Himself, only the Prophet could have known. However, the wording of the Qur'an did not make it sufficiently clear who it was whom the Prophet had seen. Whoever read or heard this passage had to make the decision himself. Modern Muslim exegesis normally insists that it was Gabriel whom the Prophet had seen on this occasion. But whenever these verses were incorporated into the traditions pertaining to Muhammad's ascension we may be pretty sure that those who were responsible for doing so included them into this context because they believed in a vision of God. For this vision was the culminating point of the climax as we saw; the audience which was granted to Muhammad by God was more than the auditory event which had already been accorded to Moses on Mount Sinai. The only problem was that the concept of God being seen by man soon came to constitute a theological scandal, or at least a problem to be addressed with utmost delicacy. For vision implied anthropomorphism and anthropomorphism (tashbih) turned out to be a vexing issue for Islam as it did for Judaism once both religions started thinking in theological terms. It never has been so for Christianity, for in Christianity anthropo morphism became self-evident by reason of the Incarnation. It would be somewhat audacious to pretend that Christian theology made things easier by this dogmatic device. Incarnation is a postulate rather than an argument. We are not surprised to hear Tertullian say in his treatise De came Christi 'On the flesh of Christ': Certum est quia impossibile, '(the Incarnation) is a certitude because it is impossible'. A Muslim would be shocked by such a statement; something which is muhal, 'absurd', cannot be certain or true. But to argue in favour of the vision of God would also give rise to problems. The contradiction emerges already in the Qur'an itself. For in a later passage, in sura 81:23, one of the visions is alluded to again: 'Your companion is not possessed. He</page><page sequence="4">50 Journal of Qur'anic Studies truly saw him on the clear horizon'. Again, simply 'him'. But here the person who was seen is called in a preceding verse a 'noble messenger, having power' and a 'messen ger' is normally an angel, certainly not God himself. Does this solve our problem? Perhaps for Muslims of our days, but not so for the interpreters of the Qur'an we are talking about. And apart from the approach of the believer, there is the historical di mension. Avoiding anthropomorphism by interpreting statements about God as state ments about an angel was an old device of Jewish theology. The angel Metatron has to play this role in certain places;2 the Kabbala later on followed the same line. The angel could then take over the functions of the creator, as a kind of demiurge, 'somebody who is obeyed', a mutof as the Muslims used to say;3 this is, as a matter of fact, the term which comes up here in sura 81. The frame conditions of the statement have visibly changed. The verse is certainly later than sura 53; for now the vision is not described in detail, it is simply mentioned again as something previously known. The audience may have lived in Medina, some Jews possibly being among them. In any case, the secondary quotation does not exclude that earlier on, in sura 53, it was God whom the Prophet is thought to have seen, for there, in sura 53, the text says, in con nection with the first vision, when the person whom Muhammad saw in fact came quite close to him: 'He revealed to His servant that he revealed'. 'His servant' can only be God's servant there, namely Muhammad. But then 'he' who revealed was not the 'noble messenger'; it would have to be God Himself and God would also be the object of the vision. Accordingly we are forced back to our earlier assumption. However, according to sura 53, the Prophet did not see God while he was in Heaven. He saw him somewhere on earth, for he saw Him 'on the higher horizon' and then 'coming down another time' (nazlatan ukhra). It is thus not the Prophet who ascends to God, God rather descends to him. It is true that, immediately afterwards, we are told that he saw Him 'by the Lote-Tree of the Boundary nigh which is the Garden of the Refuge'; this sounds like a code for Paradise, the 'Garden of the Refuge' being the abode where the blessed will find refuge during or after Judgment (cf.32:19) and the 'Lote-Tree' marking the boundary of the sanctissimum where God Himself resides. But God could descend to it nevertheless, for in those early days Paradise was fre quently imagined to be on earth. We need therefore not follow the suggestion of earlier orientalists (starting with Grimme and Caetani up to Richard Bell and Regis Blachere), namely that the 'Garden of the Refuge' was simply a plantation near Mecca and the Lote-Tree some well-known tree marking the boundary of the Meccan Sanctuary. Muslim exegesis never saw any reason to deny that the encounter took place in Para dise, even if it were somewhere on earth. The 'Lote-Tree of the Boundary' became something like the emblem of Muhammad's ascension; even when reports of the mfrdj make no other reference to surat al-Najm, the sidrat al-muntahd remains as the thresh old leading to God's own realm, the seventh Heaven; it is there that the four rivers of Paradise originate. The tree existed in the reality of the Arabian peninsula; it could</page><page sequence="5">Vision and Ascension 51 grow up to height of twelve metres.4 Whoever thus wanted to interpret these Qur'anic passages was confronted with two sets of alternatives: God or an angel, Heaven or earth. This meant altogether four possibilities. Moreover one had to keep in mind that the Qur'an spoke about two visions, not about one only. For an ascension one of them would have been sufficient - although, if the Prophet had to haggle about the number of prayers, even two of them were perhaps not enough. The game of exegesis always implies theological decisions. But these theological decisions do not grow out of unbridled imagination; they usually follow patterns which are available in the religious environment. As is well known, the idea of the heavenly journey was widespread in the Ancient World; I need not refer to the considerable corpus of secondary literature produced on this topic. A large number of categories, concepts, symbols, metaphors etc. had been developed in the Old and New Testaments and could be taken up; Uri Rubin's book on the 'Eye of the Beholder' gives numerous examples.5 The issue of 'influences' is not our central concern here; what mattered was the existential decision, the vorentscheidung, the pre-judgment of the interpreter. Those who were afraid of anthropomorphism soon came to imagine that Muhammad had merely seen an angel, namely Gabriel, and only on earth at that. The Prophet was then initiated by Gabriel into his task and received from him his first revelation. This is also, our exegete would continue to say, the reason why the event got into the Qur'an; for Gabriel, at this moment, appeared to Muhammad for the first time, and in his real angelic nature at that. We may wonder whether those who interpreted the vision this way had the biblical book of Revelation, chapter 10 in mind: T saw another mighty angel come down from Heaven, clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire'; after all, this angel carries a little book, a writing, in his hand which John then eats - a metaphorical way of expressing initiation and revelation. But this is a mere historical problem that needs further investigation. What is important for our discussion is the observation that whoever thought of an angel here had to solve the problem of why the Prophet had to see Gabriel twice; he could also not entirely ignore the grammatical problem previously mentioned, namely what to do with the recalcitrant pronoun in 'His servant'. Nevertheless this scenario was broadly accepted; we find it already in Ibn Ishaq's biography of the Prophet, a text composed in Medina, during the first half of the second hijrl century. Such an approach gained little for the ascension argument; its protagonists would have been better off is noring the passage altogether. This however was again an option which most people were not willing to accept. Therefore, the vision of God continued to be considered a viable possibility. But then one could no longer avoid speculating about the exact nature of the vision, thus making the Qur'anic description more explicit. How this was done comes out from the first testimonies of theological reflec</page><page sequence="6">52 Journal of Qur'anic Studies tion we normally have, from prophetic tradition. Hadith is frequently nothing else but exegesis in disguise. A chain of transmitters precedes each tradition in order to guaran tee trustworthiness. The first example we will examine is interesting in so far as these persons are incorporated into a kind of frame-story. Yahya reports: I asked Abu Salama: Which part of the Qur'an was revealed first? He answered: Sura 74 (yd ayyuhd 7 muddaththir). I said: But I have been told it is sura 96 (iqra bismi rabbika). Abu Salama answered: Long ago I put the same ques tion to Jabir b. cAbdallah, and he also said: Sura 74. I reacted then the same way you did now: But I have been told it is sura 96,1 said, and he replied: I can only tell (you) what I heard from the Messenger of God himself, namely: I (this is now Muhammad speaking) had retreated to Mount Hira for contemplation. When I had finished my spiritual exercises I descended to the bottom of the wadl. I heard a voice calling me, and I looked around, in front of me, behind me, to my right, to my left. (But then) Lo, there He was, sitting upon His throne, between Heaven and earth. I went to Khadija and said to her: 'Cover me with a mantle and pour cold water on me!' Then the revelation came upon me: Yd ayyuhd 'l-muddaththir, 'O thou shrouded in thy mantle, arise and warn! Thy Lord magnify...'.6 What is revealed to Muhammad is the beginning of sura 74, God's appeal by which he becomes a prophet and the call to magnify Him. This is also the gist of the story. The scholars did not agree on which Qur'anic revelation had been the oldest and this quarrel was resolved here in favour of sura 74. On such questions reference was made to authoritative opinions of the early community; therefore the controversy is presented in the form of a prophetic tradition. The chain of informants shows that the dispute took place at Medina; it was there, in the town where the Prophet had died, that it was thought that the most accurate information about Muhammad's life and experi ences was available. The Prophet thus sees God in all His greatness and sovereignty, sitting on His throne. This does not surprise us; we are familiar with such visions from the Bible and the Ancient Near East. But taken as an interpretation of sura 53 it is unusual. For though it is true that the Qur'anic passage refers to Muhammad having seen God 'on the higher horizon', 'between Heaven and earth' as the hadith says in its exegetical reformula tion, we don't hear anything about God being seated. According to the Qur'an he rather 'stood poised, being on the higher horizon' as Arberry puts it. At this point we have to resort to the tools of philology; translations are always interpretations and in the case of the Qur'an they often still depend on medieval Muslim exegesis. For the</page><page sequence="7">Vision and Ascension 53 Arabic verb behind 'He stood poised' (istawa) is equivocal; it only means 'he held himself upright'. But this can also be done when sitting and whenever the word istawa is used elsewhere in the Qur'an with regard to God it appears in the combination 'He held Himself upright on His throne'. It could therefore also be understood this way in our passage. On the other hand, whenever the vision was transferred to Gabriel the throne had to disappear; an angel does not sit on a throne, he stands. He is standing then, as says Ibn Ishaq, with his feet juxtaposed,7 'on the higher horizon' and gradu ally 'draws near'. In our hadith, on the contrary, it is clear that the throne 'drew near'; it then 'hung suspended' or came down like a bucket (dalw) in a well (tadalla) until it was only 'two bows'-length away, or nearer'. It was in this situation of intimacy, his ear close to the mouth of God, that the Prophet received his first revelation. To be precise, we should admit that, according to the story, he received his revelation only when he was back home, after having been shrouded in his mantle. But what he was told then is nothing else but what he would have heard from the mouth of God Himself: 'Arise and warn! Thy Lord magnify!'. At this very moment he was not yet asked to transmit a specific message; he simply went through an initiation. From now onward he was to magnify the Lord, and he seems to repeat this mandate to himself having come home and covered himself with a mantle in order to concentrate - this at least seems to be the significance of this striking practice. In the moment of his vision he was not yet able to receive the message; the voice which he heard seemed only to call him, and then he was completely overwhelmed by what he saw. At this point we should perhaps pause for a moment and look back. Our discussion so far has consisted mainly of hypotheses. The material we possess - and which I cannot, of course, present in detail here - is contradictory because of its axiomatic bias and the secondary literature also starts from divergent presuppositions. The first hypothesis is the easiest to corroborate: Muhammad saw, according to the report in sura 53, God and not Gabriel. This is, as I said, not in agreement with the canonical biography of the Prophet. Nor is it, properly speaking, my hypothesis; what I want to say is simply that this interpretation was favoured by a certain number of early mufassirun. We need only consult Tabari's Tafsir in order to access all the relevant material. Tabari himself was not particularly fond of anthropomorphism; he got into trouble with the Hanbalites of his time for this same reason. Consequently, he interpreted the visions of siirat al Najm as visions of an angel, of Gabriel at that. But in spite of this he cites cAbdallah b. cAbbas and Anas b. Malik as those among the Companions of the Prophet who believed them to be visions of God and then, with the same opinion, Tkrima, the slave and disciple of Ibn cAbbas.8 He even mentions a statement by Kacb al-Ahbar who carefully noted that Muhammad had seen God twice and then added, with all the authority of an expert in Judaism but not entirely in correspondence with the Old</page><page sequence="8">54 Journal of Qur'anic Studies Testament, that similarly Moses had talked to God twice.9 This reminds us again of the old climax and in point of fact, it was Ibn c Abbas to whom it was attributed: Abraham - Moses - Muhammad, the vision being the deepest experience of the divine,10 a vision of God 'in his most beautiful shape' (fi ahsani suratin) as Ibn c Abbas was supposed to have said,11 i.e., in his form as a merciful and gracious God, not in the terrifying, tremendous appearance He will assume as the Lord of the Last Judgement. But there existed also counter-traditions which stressed God's transcendence. They were connected with cA'isha, Muhammad's favourite wife, to whom statements about intimate experiences of her husband are frequently attributed; she emphatically denies his having ever seen God, under any circumstances.12 Apart from such traditions we are confronted with compromises of different sorts. People could say that the ascen sion together with the vision as well as the night journey to Jerusalem had only been a dream; this sounded especially convincing in Arabic, where there is no special word for 'dreaming' but where one simply says 'he saw in his sleep'. People could also pretend that the Prophet had not seen God in reality, 'with his eyes', but only spiritu ally, 'in his heart'. This could also ultimately amount to a dream, a veracious dream of course, for, as is said in the prophetic tradition, 'the eyes of the Prophet may sleep, but his heart does not.'13 One knew from 39:42 that the sleeper's soul ascends to God whereas his body remains in situ. And above all: the report about the first vision in sura 53 ended with the sentence 'His heart lies not of what he (Muhammad, or it: the heart) saw.'14 Finally, anthropomorphism could be avoided by dematerializing the object of the vision. Let me document this again by a hadith. The last informant says there after the chain of transmitters has been reproduced: T said to Abu Dharr al-Ghifari, the well-known companion of the Prophet: If I had met the Prophet I would have asked him a question. ?What question? ?I would have asked him whether he had seen God. Abu Dharr replied: But this is exactly what I myself once asked him. ?And what did he say? ?Light! How could I have seen Him?!'15 The last sentence is not easy. Moreover there are variant readings. But the intention of the hadith is obvious: light does not have a form; when God therefore reveals Himself as light he does not appear in any specific shape and the vision results in the Prophet being literally dazzled. This seemed to be the philosophers' stone: vision granted only together with transcendence. But it also shows, of course, that people did not want to deny the event as such; an angel was not enough. This was not just a transitory or isolated phenomenon. We find evidence for it everywhere. Let me adduce only one example, a testimony which may</page><page sequence="9">Vision and Ascension 55 look exotic but shows, as in a mirror, the broad consensus which supported the idea. About AH 160 a strange person, a 'heretic' according to the perspective of our Muslim sources, started a rebellion against the cAbbasid government in Eastern Iran and Central Asia. This was the Muqanna, a man who veiled himself and was said to have performed miracles; Jorge Luis Borges has written a short essay about him.16 He believed that God incarnated Himself in the prophets, first in Adam when he created him according to His image, also in Jesus and finally in Muhammad. The moment He slipped into Muhammad coincided with the latter's vision, for never was God so close to him, 'two bows'-length or nearer' as is said in sura 53, or Tike an arrow to its bow' as the heresiographer formulates with regard to the Muqanna's own pretension to be another - and probably the last - incarnation of God. The only new idea in his doctrine was the concept of incarnation (hulul); in order to make it palatable to his audience he proceeded from an exegesis of sura 53 which he cannot have invented himself. It seems rather to have been common knowledge among those whom he wanted to win over. This brings me to my second hypothesis: II - Muhammad saw God sitting on His throne. This is now an assumption which contradicts not only the communis opinio of the Muslims but also of Western Islamicists, for although Western scholars for philological reasons normally take the visions of sura 53 to have been visions of God,17 they nevertheless believe Muhammad to have seen God standing 'on the higher horizon', like a figure projected against the sky. The Muqanna, however, thought differently, for we are told in the same heresiographical passage that God, after each manifestation or incarnation, returned to his throne.18 The Muqanna thus understood Muhammad's vision in the sense that when God 'drew near' to the Prophet in order to unite Himself with him He left his throne. Again it would be easy to produce more texts in support of this. But we do not need them, for we can refer to a testimony which mentions this concept in immediate connection with Muhammad's micrdj. It is a hadith, an apocryphal one which, in its entire length (about twenty pages in print), is only quoted in Suyuti's La 'all al-masnita fi'l-ahddith al-mawduca. However, Tabari quotes part of it,19for the isndd starts again with Ibn c Abbas; he is followed by Dahhak b. Muzahim who represented the exegeti cal tradition connected with Ibn 'Abbas' name in Eastern Iran. Ibn Muzahim lived in the town of Balkh, i.e., in the area of the ancient Bactrian Empire, a melting-pot of religions and civilizations, where a small Arabic aristocracy controlled the trade route towards Central Asia. The hadith says when the heavenly journey reaches its culmi nating point: T looked at Him (i.e., God) with my heart until I was sure that He was present and that I really saw Him. For suddenly He removed the curtain and there He was, sitting on His throne in all His dignity and glory ... He bent over a little bit in His dignity</page><page sequence="10">56 Journal of Qur'anic Studies towards me and bade me draw nearer. For this is the word of the Scripture where He reports how He treated me and glorified me (53:5-10): '... He who is terrible in power, very strong. He held himself upright which, in this context, can only mean: on the throne, being on the higher horizon. Then he drew near and hung suspended, two bows'-length away, or nearer ... And he revealed to His servant that He revealed', namely the task He had decided to impose on me.20 The 'task' referred to here is obviously Muhammad's prophetic mission. Anas b. Malik - or those who referred to him - had put it in more concrete terms: God reveals to Muhammad the fifty prayers which He wants to impose on his community.21 Dahhak b. Muzahim was less precise; he wanted to describe Muhammad's vision. And he does so with some caution: Muhammad has to close his eyes; even Gabriel (who knew, of course, the effect of this sight) covers them with his hands. But for the moment the prophet has been struck by the insupportable power of the light and this is what he sees now in his heart: God sitting on His throne, coming near to him in order to touch him and to transfer his revelation in a truly corporeal way: 'He put one of his hands be tween my shoulder-blades, and for some time I felt the coolness of his fingers coming through to my heart...' This brings me to my third hypothesis: III - The throne vision was the point where the literary motif of the ascension, which was originally foreign to the Qur'an, could sneak in. If the Scripture seemed to confirm the Prophet's having seen God sitting on His throne there was no obstacle to imagining that he had ascended to Heaven in order to see Him where the throne was located. However, the new context implied different emphasis. All of a sudden there was the possibility of, even the urge to, combining the two visions mentioned in sura 53 into a single event where Muhammad would have seen God 'on the higher horizon' and then again - or at the same time - in the 'Garden of the Refuge', 'by the Lote-Tree of the Boundary'. Moreover, the direction had changed; it was now the Prophet who moved and not God and the Prophet moved upward, not downward as did God - or the angel - in the Qur'an. Muslim theology was on the point of discovering that God does not move at all; He is immutable. This was a transcendentalist axiom and for the transcendentalists it could be the first step in overcoming their repugnance against the motif of the ascension as such. Finally, Muhammad's miraculous movement from one place to another facilitated the introduction of the other Qur'anic motif where he seemed to travel or to be carried off in a miraculous way: namely his Night Journey to Jerusalem. This second miraculous event does not have to occupy us here. It originally belonged to a different setting, in spite of the indissoluble bond with the motif of the ascension which was created afterwards. In Ibn Ishaq's biography of the Prophet both reports are</page><page sequence="11">Vision and Ascension 57 still isolated from each other; Ibn Sacd even assigns them to different dates. There were, however, two things which paved the way for the attempt to combine them: a) According to religious imagery, God's throne could also be located in Jerusalem, his terrestrial throne to be precise, the throne from which He created the world and to which He will return at the end of times in order to sit in judgement on all mankind, and b) In the beginning the night journey was sometimes understood as a nocturnal translation to a heavenly place of worship, namely to the hayt mamur, the 'House inhabited'of 52:4 which, in scholarly speculation, was interpreted as the equivalent of the terrestrial kacba at Mecca, a celestial Jerusalem as it were. This brings us to an entirely new dimension of our topic; we cannot deal with it here.22 But let us note at least that, under these circumstances, the isrd' could also end with a vision of God and that this vision was then described in the same way as was done with respect to the mfraj: the Prophet meets God in a garden on the Haram al-Sharif, the ancient Temple Mount, in a hortus conclusus as it is said (ft hazlra), i.e., amidst the enclosure formed by the walls of the Herodian - or, as people believed at that time, Salomonic - temple. He sees Him there sitting on a throne, in the shape of a youth bearing a crown of light,23 and then God touches him as a proof of intimacy. Let me conclude now and, in summarizing, bring in a last factor: chronology. There is one thing we have to be clear about right away: I have been talking about exegesis and not about reality. We shall never know what Muhammad really saw, and even he himself before talking about the event had to interpret it. The formulation in sura 81 is clear: he had seen a 'venerable messenger', i.e., an angel (which does not necessarily mean Gabriel). The statements in surat al-Najm are certainly earlier, and they are also more explicit; but with regard to the question we asked they remain ambiguous. Moreo ver, in spite of being early they do not seem to be the immediate expression of the event as such, for in this case we would not expect two apparitions to be mentioned at once. On the other hand, the text is obviously homogeneous; the rhyme remains the same throughout the entire sura, with exception of the last six verses (57-62). We can therefore not explain the combination of the two visions as the outcome of later redaction, under TJthman or before. The hypothesis which suggests itself in this situation is: The beginning of surat al-Najm does not describe one event which happened immediately before, but rather refers to two of them in order to underline, by their singularity, the veracity of something else. Where is then the 'Sitz im Leberi of the sural This is not a question to which we can give a definite answer. But going back to Tabari again, to his Tafsir24 as well as his Tdrikh,25 we are left with the impression that, for him, surat al-Najm was connected, in its first half, with the affair of the ' satanic verses'. As is well known, the three pagan goddesses are mentioned in verses 19-20, immedi ately after the report about the second vision and they are mentioned there and no</page><page sequence="12">58 Journal of Qur'anic Studies where else in the Qur'an. We need not assume that the 'satanic verses' ever formed part of the sura - on the contrary, they are refuted there. But their rhyme is the same. When the Qur'an says that Lat, TJzza, and Manat cannot be of any relevance for the new religion, the audience is supposed to connect this with the false revelation which had been spread. This is at least how we may be allowed to interpret Tabari - and the sources he used. The consequences for our topic are enormous. Thematically, the em phasis would shift from the visions to the refutation of the ill-advised theologoumenon; the instrument by which the three goddesses were supposed to exert their influence, i.e. intercession (shafaca), is still the topic of verse 26. The beginning of surat al-Najm, however, would then be nothing else but a solemn start, the introduction of a speech, a sermon perhaps, held by the Prophet when, as is also suggested by the reports we find in Tabari,26 those who had emigrated to Ethiopia came back, people who had heard what had happened in Mecca only through rumours and who were eager to know what the Prophet really thought about the subject. The greatest possible authority and persuasion would have been needed in order to invalidate the inculpations; in order to reach this goal the Prophet could have referred to his encounters with the heavenly power, the 'numinous' as we say today.4Your comrade is not astray, neither errs, nor speaks he out of caprice. This is nought but a revelation revealed, taught him by one terrible in power, very strong', if we follow Arberry's translation. What was important was the encounter as such; the question who it was whom he had encountered could remain, for the moment, unanswered. I leave this hypothesis as it is; my concern is exegesis and not reality. On the exegetical level we are confronted with a totally different situation. When the mufassirun began their work the Qur'an had become a Scripture, the canonized collec tion of all the texts revealed to Muhammad. It is true that, during the first generations, one did not forget that surat al-Najm had some connection with the 'satanic verses'. But this was not relevant, for even if the event had ever occurred it had remained an episode; the 'satanic verses' never had a chance to form part of the final redaction of the Qur'an. The two visions of surat al-Najm, instead of being an allusion made by the prophet to something previously known, as a proof of his veracity in a delicate moment, were now taken to be an immediate testimony of his first contact with God or his messenger. In the same time, the second reference to the event, in sura 81, came to the fore. Being part of the 'Book' this sentence was now on the same level as sura 53; a 'Book' had to be consistent. In a way the scholars continued to be aware of the fact that revelations had been reactions to specific situations; this is why they talked about asbab al-nuzul. But as far as the contents were concerned the passages had to be balanced against each other. The jurists soon elaborated the category of abrogation (naskh) in order to solve the ensuing difficulties. But in our case this device did not work; theological statements could not be assumed to have been made in a different way at different times.</page><page sequence="13">Vision and Ascension 59 Under these circumstances we cannot but be struck by the high degree of acceptance which the anthropomorphic interpretation of surat al-Najm found in the early commu nity. We can, of course, not be sure whether the discussion really goes back to the generation of the sahaba; much of what was related about the urgemeinde is projec tion rather than reality. Ibn c Abbas has been treated as a kind of mythological figure in recent scholarship.27 cA'isha may have witnessed how the statements concerning her husband's visions in what was to become a Holy Scripture afterwards became less equivocal, or how the Prophet himself became increasingly more cautious in interpret ing them, but her statements are sometimes phrased in a way as to contain polemical remarks against later theological currents, especially of a Shiite type. At the time when the visions occurred she was not yet born. We may be pretty sure that the question became a matter of serious dispute only later on, perhaps not before the end of the first century. During Hisham b. cAbdalmalik's caliphate, some time between AH 105 and 120, Jad b. Dirham was executed in Iraq, allegedly for having denied that Abraham was God's friend and that Moses had been addressed by God Himself on Mount Sinai; Jad had obviously rejected the climax attributed to Ibn c Abbas and consequently also Muhammad's vision of God.28 His 'heresy' was, however not so 'new' a bidca as the heresiographers pretend. He stood in a tradition, and there seems to have been a certain continuity between sura 81, cA'isha's statement and his rejection of anthropomor phism, although he himself may have already been influenced by Neoplatonism in Harran where he had lived. As to the stories about Muhammad's ascension, they also seem to have flourished mainly in Iraq; there the idea of the heavenly journey was deeply rooted in Hellenistic gnosticism and apocalyptic or mystical Judaism. In Mecca and Medina the scholars remained cautious; Ibn Ishaq who did not believe the Prophet to have seen God Him self did not grant Muhammad's ascension a prominent place in his narrative either and accepted it only in an attenuated version. In Syria people apparently preferred to think rather in terms of the night journey; Jerusalem was what they were interested in. They did not object to Muhammad's having seen God and even having been touched by Him, but they did not have any need for the motif of the ascension. Yet this latter motif turned out to be the stronger one, probably simply due to the fact that, with the event of the Abbasids, Iraq became the political and intellectual center of the Islamic world. From there it spread to Eastern Iran; already in the Umayyad period Iraqi troups had settled there. Our most extensive report came, as we saw, from Balkh; Dahhak b. Muzahim, to whom it was attributed, claimed to have got it from Ibn c Abbas. Even here we are, as far as authenticity is concerned, not yet on safe ground. However, the oldest testimony which can be reliably dated is found again in Iraq. The only problem is that in this case the motif is not connected with Muhammad; it is used by - or with respect to - a heretic who pretended to be a prophet himself: a Shiite by the name of Abu Mansur al-Ijl.</page><page sequence="14">60 Journal of Qur'anic Studies I cannot deal with him here; suffice it to say that he belonged to the ghuldt, the lunatic fringe of early Shiism. He was executed in the twenties of the second hijri century; he had started a rebellion. His adherents justified his claim by pretending that he had ascended to Heaven. God had talked to him in Persian, they said, and addressed him by the title 'my son' (yd pasar); afterward He had sent him back to earth in order to proclaim His word. Abu Mansur apparently considered himself to be a son of God; his adherents called him the Logos (al-kalima) and took the oath by that term. They looked upon him as the Messiah since God had touched his head with His hand. The verb for touching a person's head, patting it as one does with a child, is masaha in Arabic, and mash, the Arabic equivalent to Hebrew meshah, the Messiah, is simply the passive participle to this verb. The word itself does not primarily mean 'to anoint' like Hebrew mashah or Aramaic meshah; Abu Mansur's adherents - and possibly he himself - thus understood the Messiah in their own, Arabic way. This was a very imaginative manner of taking up the motif. We may be pretty sure that Abu Mansur wanted to vie with Muhammad in this respect, but the model he followed was Jesus. What is important for us is that he failed; the outcome of his preaching was simply a riot, the occupation of a mosque perhaps. Whoever arrogated the motif of the ascen sion to himself no longer remained unpunished. Only a prophet could pay a visit to God and meanwhile the vast majority had decided Muhammad to have been the last prophet, the 'seal of the Prophets'. The Shiites did, in a certain way, not belong to this majority; this is why they still retained early views for some time. This also applies to anthropomorphism; they adhered to it even after they had calmed down, so to speak, and stopped producing new prophets. But in the long run they, too, changed their mind; not only did they dissociate themselves from people like Abu Mansur, but they also became transcendentalists as most of the Sunnis had already become. All of them, Sunnis and Shiis alike, have remained so until today; they owe this common outlook mainly to the impact of Muctazilite theology. When in the period of the Mamluks, during the ninth hijri century, somebody in Cairo pretended to have ascended to heaven in order to see God and to talk to Him, he was simply put into a lunatic asylum. Muhammad's ascension, however, had a long and triumphant history, in art and in literature, even in a Latin text like the Liber Scalae Machometi which may have influ enced Dante in his Divine Comedy. Normally the Prophet was no longer believed to have seen God during his encounter; he only heard His voice, preferably from behind a veil. But the event was not understood as being mere dream either; it was a reality, a miracle. And even the vision of God was not completely ruled out, though in a differ ent context. Sunni Islam went through a protracted discussion about whether the ru 'yd bVl-absar, the beatific vision after the Last Judgment, should be part of the creed; it was finally decided that in Paradise all Muslims will see God, albeit only intermit tently, as in a theatre when the curtain, the veil, rises as a token of divine grace. But</page><page sequence="15">Vision and Ascension 61 then the world will have come to an end and vision is part of eternal bliss. The Prophet, on the contrary, had a task to accomplish; therefore he had to return to earth. His glorification marked the beginning, not the end of his career. He became a symbol of Muslim identity and in this respect his uniqueness is more strongly felt today than ever before. But his uniqueness is nowadays mainly defined in this-worldly categories, especially in connection with his achievements as a leader of his community. His supernatural encounter with the divine remained an isolated event; the Scripture itself, though evoked in its support, prevented its full deployment. In this respect Islamic theological thinking, if compared to Christian speculations and perhaps to its advan tage, stopped half-way.
