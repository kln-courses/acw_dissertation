Introduction It is a trite saying that Rome was not built in a day, but with regard to the communitarisation of private international law by way of various Regula tions named after the eternal city, it is hard to avoid this commonplace.1 After a first draft for a convention on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations had already been presented in 1972,2 it took another 35 years of repeatedly interrupted attempts at codification before the final Rome II Regulation, the first comprehensive EC Regulation on a subject of private international law, could be enacted on July 11, 2007.3 Hopefully, further legislative activities in this area will be less time-consuming. It is a positive 1 The literature on the communitarisation of PIL is vast; on the fundamental issues, see, e.g., J?rgen Basedow, EC conflict of laws ? a matter of coordination, in: Semin?rio Internac ional sobre a Comunitariza?ao do Direito Internacional Privado, ed. by Luis de Lima Pinheiro (2005) 17?30; Johan Meeusen, Instrumentalisation of Private International Law in the Euro pean Union: Towards a European Conflicts Revolution?: Eur.

As first-born, Rome II deserves particular attention. The influence of fam ily structures and the position as a first-, middle- or last-born child on a person's mental and social development has been a subject of extensive re search in the field of psychology for a long time.8 With regard to the grow ing family of EC regulations on conflicts, the question arises as to whether Rome II will serve as a model for essential value judgments concerning the further communitarisation of private international law. The recently enact ed Rome I Regulation, the younger sibling, already shows a discernible influence of the final Rome II Regulation as compared with the Commis sion's preceding draft of 2005,9 especially with regard to two important is sues, the maintaining of an escape clause (Art. 4(3) Rome II, Art. 4(3) Rome I),10 and the respect for party autonomy as a general principle even vis-?-vis 4 Regulation (EC) No. 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I), O.J. 2008 L 177/6. 5 For a survey of recent developments up to June 2008, see, e.g., Dirk Looschelders, Schei dungsfreiheit und Schutz des Antragsgegners im internationalen Privat- und Prozessrecht, in: Die richtige Ordnung 329?351; Dieter Mar tiny, Auf dem Weg zu einem europ?ischen Interna tionalen Eheg?terrecht: ibid. 373-398; Thomas Rauscher/Steffen Pabst, Entwicklungen im eu rop?ischen und v?lkervertraglichen Kollisionsrecht 2005-2007: Zeitschrift f?r Gemein schaftsprivatrecht (GPR) 2007, 244-254 (251 et seq.). 6 See The Economist, Divorce without borders, 31.7. 2008, available online at &lt;http:// www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfmPstory^d^ 11849262 &amp;fsrc=RSS &gt; ; "EU-L?nder regeln Scheidungsrecht", Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) of 26. 7. 2008, No. 173, p. 5. 7 Convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations of 19 June 1980, (Consoli dated Version), O.J. 1998 C 27/34. 8 See Frank J.

The discussion on Rome II, especially the draft presented by the European Parliament in 200513, was never an exclu sively intra-European affair; on the contrary, a sometimes considerable in fluence of American cousins, such as the 2nd Restatement on Conflict of Laws14 and the Louisiana Civil Code15, made itself felt.16 The final version of the Rome II Regulation, however, for the most part abandons the proposals contained in the largely U. S.-inspired Parliament's draft of 2005.17 While a detailed examination of the various American influences on the preparation of the Rome II Regulation is beyond the scope of this paper, this back ground should be kept in mind. Although the Rome II Regulation covers not only torts, but encompasses unjust enrichment and negotiorum gestio as well, this article will be focused on torts. Most provisions of the Regulation relate to torts, and this is also by far the most important group of cases in which non-contractual issues are liti gated. I will however, include culpa in contrahendo, which is more "tort-like" than the other two types of obligations, as the structure of Art. 12 Rome II 11 See infra VI. 12 On the goal of consistency of Rome II with Rome I, see infra Il.l.b; on the current state of the "general principles" of European PIL, see Christian Heinze, Bausteine eines Allgemeinen Teils des europ?ischen Internationalen Privatrechts, in: Die richtige Ordnung 105-127; Hans J?rgen Sonnenberger, Randbemerkungen zum Allgemeinen Teil eines europ?isierten IPR: ibid. 227?246 (hereinafter: Randbemerkungen); on the contribution of Rome II to the develop ment of such principles, see Leibte, Beitrag. 13 Position of the European Parliament adopted at first reading on 6 July 2005 with a view to the adoption of Regulation EC No_/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Coun cil on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations ("Rome II"), reprinted in: Unifica tion (supra n. 1) 392-406 (hereinafter: European Parliament's Position of 2005). 14 Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws (1971). 15 Louisiana Civil Code, Law No. 923 of 1991, in: Au?ereurop?ische IPR-Gesetze, ed. by Jan Kropholler et al.

Then, I will analyse the basic connecting factors employed by the Rome II Regulation: the place of injury (infra III.), common habitual residence (infra IV.), the general es cape clause (infra V), and party autonomy (infra VI.). After that, the rules governing special torts (including culpa in contrahendo) as well as the re maining scope for domestic PIL rules will be examined (infra VIL). The aim here is not to deal with every possibly controversial detail involved in the interpretation of particular provisions, but rather on the wider question as to why and to what extent the specific rules deviate from the basic connecting factors used for torts in general.19 After that, I will comment briefly on two pervasive issues that received considerable attention during the genesis of Rome II, but which are not dealt with comprehensively in the final Regula tion: Public policy and mandatory provisions, on the one hand (infra VIII.), and the treatment of foreign law by the courts of the member states, on the other (infra IX.). II. The Communitarisation of Tort Conflicts Law: Reasons and Limits 1. The basic economic rationale a) International decisional harmony and lower costs of litigation The basic economic rationale underlying the Rome II Regulation is suc cinctly captured in Recital No. 6, which reads as follows: "The proper functioning of the internal market creates a need, in order to im prove the predictability of the outcome of litigation, certainty as to the law appli cable and the free movement of judgments, for the conflict-of-law rules in the Member States to designate the same national law irrespective of the country of the court in which an action is brought." This recital epitomises the basic tenet of the methodology developed by Savigny in the 19th century, i.e. the goal of international decisional harmo 18 Cf. also Fall?n 277 (arguing that culpa in contrahendo "appears to be in tort, while the others [unjust enrichment and negotiorum gestio] are elements of the concept of 'quasi-con tract'"). 19 For a more detailed comment on issues of interpretation, see Jan von Hein, Europ?isches Internationales Deliktsrecht nach der Rom Ii-Verordnung: ZEuP 2009, 6-33.</page><page sequence="7">73 (2009) OF OLDER SIBLINGS AND DISTANT COUSINS 467 ny.20 The Commission's explanation for its draft of 2003 is even more ex plicit with regard to the deterrence of forum shopping: Unless conflicts rules for non-contractual obligations become unified, "[t]he risk is that parties will opt for the courts of one Member State rather than another simply be cause the law applicable in the courts of this State would be more favourable to them".21 The explanation for the draft of2003 also makes clear that a uni fication of tort conflicts rules is not legalistic art for art's sake, but that it rests on a sound economic rationale, i.e. the reduction of transaction costs borne by the parties: A European Regulation on tort conflicts "allows the parties to confine themselves to studying a single set of conflict rules, thus reducing the cost of litigation and boosting the foreseeability of solutions and certain ty as to the law".22 This rationale is particularly important for tort conflicts, because, contrary to contract conflicts, a choice of the applicable law ex ante was traditionally not available in many jurisdictions.23 Even if the parties en joy that possibility, they will frequently not be able to exercise this right be cause they do not anticipate an accident happening.24 Accordingly, objective conflicts rules have significantly greater weight in tort than in contract cas es.25 The - to some, perhaps, surprisingly ? modern economic rationale of the Savignian methodology that is at the heart of the Rome II Regulation de serves particular emphasis in light of the fact that the substantivist and neo statutist conflicts revolution that raged in the United States in the 1960's and 1970's has so far failed to yield a consensus on which a third Restatement or a codification of conflicts rules for torts could be built.26 Lately, however, there are signs of a realignment of American and European conflicts meth odology, not least because economic analysis of law, the dominant force in American academia today, has rediscovered choice of law as a subject worthy of attention.27 Already more than 20 years ago, Judge Richard Posner open 20 Friedrich Carl von Savigny, A Treatise on the Conflict of Laws (William Guthrie transi.)

O'Hara, Conflict of Laws,</page><page sequence="8">468 JAN VON HEIN RabelsZ ly accused the revolutionary U. S. conflicts methodologies of having "caused pervasive uncertainty, higher cost of litigation, more forum shopping [...] and an uncritical drift in favor of plaintiffs".28 Since the normative focus of economic analysis, i.e. enhancing the efficiency of litigation, and the values underlying Savignyan conflicts thinking converge, it comes as no surprise that the results of more economic approaches to choice of law in the United States closely resemble long-standing, "classic" European solutions in this area.29 Parisi and O'Hara, for example, explain that the possibility of "forum shopping" will trigger a "race to the courthouse" that may have "substantial efficiency implications, accelerating the filing process and creating cases that may not have matured into court claims had they been left to the choice of the natural plaintiff".30 They further conclude that the lex fori should not be given preferential treatment because doing so would undermine the predict ability of the applicable law.31 Finally, they argue that open-ended, standard based approaches such as the better law approach or governmental interest in: The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics and the Law, ed. by Peter Newman I (1998) 387-396; Erin A.

[...] This applies, in particu lar, to the idea that the welfare of individuals, not sovereignty, is the right yard stick for conflict of laws."34 Moreover, the clear theoretical advantage of traditional conflicts method ology is bolstered by the force of the practical example that emanates from the successful codification of supranational conflicts rules in the Rome II and Rome I Regulations. Although a first American reaction towards the Rome II Regulation has been rather critical, denouncing the final text as a "missed opportunity" to transplant U.S. doctrines to Europe,35 there is a palpable transatlantic interest in recent European developments and the les sons that these may hold for the United States.36 Most recently, a well-known American conflicts scholar has actually praised the Rome II Regulation for having stayed on the right methodological track and recommended the Eu ropean codification of tort conflicts as a model for further U. S. legislation.37 While the "end of history" for private international law, i.e. a full conver gence of U. S. and European conflict of laws in torts, is still a long road ahead, the successful communitarisation of private international law will certainly increase the prospects for creating harmonised conflicts rules on a global level.38 32 Parisi/O'Hara (supra . 27) 393; see also Wiegand (supra n. 28) 26. 33 Cf.

This Recital deserves to be taken with a grain of salt, however. Interpreting "consistency" with the Brussels I Regulation literally would lead to problematic results because the Rome II Regulation is committed to the goal of international decisional harmony "irrespective of the country of the court in which an action is brought".40 Accordingly, there are inherent limitations against a full parallelism of the connecting factors used by rules on jurisdiction, on the one hand, and conflicts rules, on the other.41 The most vivid example for the actual decoupling of Rome II and Brussels I is the basic rule for torts: Whereas Art. 5(3) of the Brussels I Regulation is generally interpreted as enshrining the principle of ubiquity, i.e. as giving the plaintiff an option to sue either at the place of acting or at the place of injury,42 Art. 4(1) Rome II opts for the place of injury alone,43 precisely be cause the choice of forum should not, generally speaking, predetermine the applicable law.44 Not even the substantial scope of Brussels I and Rome II is on all fours: Whereas Art. 5 No. 3 of the Brussels I Regulation undoubtedly applies to infringements of personality rights45 for example, this group of cases is excluded from Rome II's scope (Art. l(2)(g) Rome II).46 World, ed. by Eckart Gottschalk et al.

The necessity of creating a harmonious regime for contractual as well as non contractual obligations was already recognised in the 1972 draft which en compassed both types of claims.47 Nevertheless, there are cases in which the legislator's ambition to ensure a formal consistency with Rome I seems to have gone too far.48 c) Lack of alternatives Moreover, the Rome II Regulation illustrates the fact that a communi tarisation of private international law is needed because of the lack of viable medium or short-term alternatives. Although in certain constellations "hid den" conflicts rules may be derived from EC primary or secondary law, these solutions fail to guarantee a foreseeability of results in the same way that a comprehensive codification of conflicts rules can.49 Likewise, a full blown harmonisation of substantive tort law is not a realistic prospect for the medium term, as the Commission emphasised in the explanation for its draft of 2003.50 Even in areas where a unification of substantive laws is desirable and feasible, the enlightened view today is that a need for conflicts rules will remain because of the incompleteness of sectorally and/or regionally limited endeavours.51 Apart from such pragmatic concerns, it deserves to be stressed that from an economic point of view uniform choice of law rules are not merely a second-best solution, a stopgap in lieu of a full-blown substantive harmonisation; rather, they have the advantage of allowing a competition among substantive rules of tort law and avoiding the danger of a p?trification that is inherent in every supranational unification of substantive laws.52 Finally, non-state law such as the FIS-Rules for skiing accidents may de fine rules of safety and conduct within the meaning of Art. 17 Rome II, but, Uncertainty from Abroad, Rome II and the Choice of Law for Defamation Claims: Brook.

Relationship with third states The Rome II Regulation applies in all "situations involving a conflict of laws", without limiting its scope to conflicts between Member States' laws (Art. 1(1) Rome II). In addition, Art. 3 Rome II lays down the principle of universal application, i.e. that any law specified by the Regulation shall be applied whether or not it is the law of a Member State. Thus, the Rome II Regulation creates uniform conflicts rules not only for intra-community cases, but for cases involving the laws of third states as well. This has been criticised as being incompatible with the competence upon which the Reg ulation is based, which refers to the internal market (Arts. 61(c), 65(b), 67 EC).55 Although a strict literal interpretation of Art. 65(b) may be defensible in the abstract, the constant legislative practice of the EC has made this criticism practically moot.56 It is highly questionable that the ECJ will inter vene in this area after the judges have explicitly decided that the EC has the exclusive competence to negotiate and conclude the new Lugano Conven tion on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments with third states.57 Apart from that, having two sets of conflicts rules for intra-community 53 On the FIS Rules (available at &lt;http://www.fis-ski.com&gt;), see Jan von Hein, Schadens ersatz bei Skiunfall in Kanada: Geltung der FIS-Regeln bei dt.

The EU and the Hague Conference The full communitarisation of private international law is impeded by the fact that Brussels is not the only forum for supranational activities directed at creating uniform choice of law rules. The preparation of the Rome II Regulation in particular faced the obstacle that two supranational instru ments dealing with important areas of tort conflicts already exist, i.e. the Hague Convention on the law applicable to Traffic Accidents (HCTA) and the Hague Convention on the law applicable to Products Liability (HCP).59 Both conventions count several EC Member States among their parties.60 Those Member States were unwilling to withdraw from the respective con ventions.61 Since the EC could arguably not terminate their membership without their consent, rules governing the collision between communitar ised conflicts rules and the Hague conventions had to be invented.62 The solution finally codified in the Rome II Regulation provides that the Regu lation does not prejudice the application of existing conventions which con tain conflicts rules for non-contractual obligations (Art. 28(1) Rome II).63 The Rome II Regulation takes precedence, however, over conventions con cluded exclusively between two or more of them in so far as such conven tions concern matters governed by the Regulation (Art. 28(2) Rome II).

PIL 9 (2007) 137-148.</page><page sequence="14">474 JAN VON HEIN RabelsZ state parties, this exception is of little practical use.64 Even if, for example, a traffic accident is only connected with Austria and Germany, Austrian Courts have to apply the HCTA, whereas a German court must determine the applicable law under the Rome II Regulation.65 Thus, in two of the most important areas of tort conflicts, traffic accidents and product liability, Eu ropean private international law remains fragmented and continues to offer ample possibilities of forum shopping.66 This situation is exacerbated by the fact that the Rome II Regulation excludes the possibility of renvoi (Art. 24 Rome II Regulation). This is contrary to the former laws of several member states, such as Germany. Under Art. 40(1) and Art. 4 of the German Intro ductory Code, for example, courts could up to now apply the rules of the HCTA to an accident that had taken place in a state party to this convention although Germany had not acceded to this treaty.67 In this respect, the Rome II Regulation is even stricter than the Rome I Regulation which allows for renvoi at least if the articles of the Rome I Regulation so provide (Art. 20 Rome I). It remains to be seen whether a certain degree of international decisional harmony can be restored in this area by a generous interpretation of the escape clause (Art. 4(3) Rome II) and the rule on party autonomy (Art. 14 Rome II).68 III. Place of Injury v. Place of Acting: The Basic Rule 1. Place of injury The basic rule for torts in general is found in Art. 4(1) Rome II, which refers to the place of injury. Recital No. 15 of the Rome II Regulation ac knowledges that "lex loci delicti is the basic solution for non-contractual ob ligations in virtually all the Member States". Nevertheless, the diverging interpretations of this principle by various Member States' legislatures and courts in complex cases (place of injury, place of acting, or even both under the so-called theory of ubiquity) have led to legal uncertainty.69 The prefer ence for the place of injury is justified because, generally speaking, it strikes 64 HCTA: Belarus, Bosnia &amp; Hercegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Switzerland; HCP: Croatia, Macedonia, Norway. 65 Ofner 15 et seq. 66 Ansgar Staudinger, Das Konkurrenzverh?ltnis zwischen dem Haager Stra?enverkehrs ?bereinkommen und der Rom II-VO, in: Die richtige Ordnung 671-713; Thomas Thiede/ Markus Kellner, "Forum shopping" zwischen dem Haager ?bereinkommen ?ber das auf Ver kehrsunf?lle anzuwendende Recht und der Rom-II-Verordnung: VersR 2007, 1624?1628. 67 E.g.

A minor inconsistency is that Art. 4(1) Rome II explicitly provides for the scenario where the indirect consequences of an event giving rise to damages occur in several countries ("country or countries"), but does not mention the not unusual case where a single event leads to injuries in several states. This scenario is dealt with explicitly only for cartel damage claims in Art. 6(3) (b) Rome II (see infra VII. 1. a bb). Another group of cases in which a single tortious act usually affects more than one country, defama tion by mass media, is not subject to the Rome II Regulation (Art. l(2)(g) Rome II).75 For other cases in which several injuries are spread across more than one country, e.g. in cases of pure economic loss, the mosaic principle applies, i.e. that each injury is governed by the law in force at the respective 70 Recital No. 16. 71 Von Hein, G?nstigkeitsprinzip 217-220. 72 Garcimart?n Alf?rez 1-84; de Lima Pinheiro 16. 73 Cf.

Multiple acts may however lead to diffi culties under some of the specific rules for special torts, e.g. multiple events giving rise to a single damage under Art. 7 Rome II, various acts of infringe ment committed in different countries under Art. 8 (2) Rome II or several acts of striking members of the same union but in different states under Art. 9 Rome II.78 A recourse to the general escape clause, following a "cen tre- of-gravity" approach, is not possible in these cases because Art. 4(3) Rome II is not applicable to these special torts.79 2. Place of acting and country of origin In the course of the preparation of the Rome II Regulation, the place of injury was accepted rather early as the decisive connecting factor for torts in general,80 but the place of acting received considerable support in a more modern, European guise as the "country of origin".81 Yet all attempts to codify in the text of the Regulation itself that the country-of-origin princi ple should take precedence over the place of injury failed because a general preference for the place of acting would have been incompatible with the basic economic rationale underlying the Regulation's structure: A universal application of the country-of-origin principle without a preceding harmo 76 Bri?re, R?glement 42 et seq.; Garcimartin Alf?rez 1-84; Heiss/Loacker 625; Hohloch 10; de Lima Pinheiro 20; Ojher 16; Stone 111; G.

Yet this does not mean that the country of origin principle has been ren dered irrelevant. Article 27 Rome II explicitly states that "provisions of Community law which, in relation to particular matters, lay down conflict of-law rules relating to non-contractual obligations" take precedence over the Regulation. And Recital No. 35 adds that the Regulation "should not prejudice the application of other instruments laying down provi sions designed to contribute to the proper functioning of the internal market in so far as they cannot be applied in conjunction with the law designated by the rules of this Regulation. The application of provisions of the applicable law des ignated by the rules of this Regulation should not restrict the free movement of goods and services as regulated by Community instruments, such as [...] [the] Directive on electronic commerce". The precise reach of this exhortation is hard to define because the Direc tive on electronic commerce itself takes the somewhat schizophrenic posi tion that it does not contain conflict-of-law rules (Art. 1(4) E-Commerce Directive), while at the same time laying down the country-of-origin prin ciple in its Art. 3(1) and (2).84 Recital No. 35 of the Rome II Regulation seems to imply a two-step procedure: First, the applicable law has to be "designated by the rules of" the Rome II Regulation; in a second step, this result has to be examined in light of the free movement of goods and serv ices. If this leads to a violation of the country-of-origin principle under per tinent secondary legislation, the conflicts rules of the Rome II Regulation may have to be applied in a modified way. Especially the escape clause con tained in Art. 4(3) Rome II leaves ample scope to devise solutions that avoid frictions between the preference for the place of injury under Art. 4(1) Rome II and secondary legislation.85 82 See supra ILI. a; Le?ble /Lehmann 721. 83 See supra ILI. a; Le?ble /Lehmann 721 et seq. 84 Cf.

Systematic place of lex loci delicti The final Rome II Regulation is rather conservative in giving lex loci delicti pride of place as the "general rule" for torts. As Jan Kropholler point ed out in a seminal article in this journal already 40 years ago, lex loci delicti, is, for logical and systematical reasons, in fact rather a subsidiary rule:86 it applies only if the parties have not chosen the applicable law (Art. 14 Rome II), if there is no manifestly closer connection, e.g. because of a con tract between the parties (Art. 4(3) Rome II) and if there is no common habitual residence of the parties (Art. 4(2) Rome II).87 Earlier drafts had not shied away from the logical conclusion and, in line with more recent codifi cations, moved party autonomy up front.88 This structure would also have been more consistent with the Rome I Regulation, which still puts free choice of law by the parties before the objective conflicts rules (Art. 3 Rome I). Nevertheless, experience has shown that "accidents are rarely planned",89 which leads to a significantly lower number of agreements on the applicable law in the area of torts than is the case for contracts. Thus, the systematic ordering of the rules in the final Rome II Regulation may well reflect their respective importance in daily court practice. 4. Remnants of ubiquity a) Ubiquity for reasons of substantive justice Although the Rome II Regulation does not, as a general principle, em brace the plaintiff-friendly principle of ubiquity found in German or Italian PIL,90 there are two important remnants of this theory in the final Rome II Regulation. First of all, the rule on environmental damage (Art. 7 Rome II) allows the victim to opt for the law of the country in which the event giving rise to the damage occurred instead of the law of the place of injury desig nated by the general rule (Art. 4(1) Rome II).91 In this respect, the Regula 86 Jan Kropholler, Ein Ankn?pfungssystem f?r das Deliktsstatut: RabelsZ 33 (1969) 601? 653. 87 Cf.

This exception to the general methodological framework is legitimised by the goal of main taining a high level of environmental protection as enshrined in Art. 174 EC.92 It rests on models in national codifications such as the Swiss PIL Act (Art. 138).93 Codifying the place of injury as a general rule while clinging to the principle of ubiquity with regard to environmental damage has been criticised, however, from two opposite angles: On the one hand, several authors have denied the justification for a specific rule on environmental damage, arguing that applying the law of the place of injury ensures a suf ficient level of protection in this group of cases as well.94 On the other hand, the Rome II Regulation has been accused of being indifferent to violations of human or consumer rights by limiting this favouring of the weaker party to cases involving environmental pollution.95 It has been argued that multi national corporations should be generally held to a higher standard prevail ing in industrialised nations if they cause damage to persons living in devel oping countries.96 Yet the Rome II Regulation deserves praise for steering a course between these two extremes:97 A general favouring of the weaker party in all types of tort cases has never been convincingly justified and, for most cases of bi-lo cal torts, would lead to significantly higher costs of litigation because it en genders pervasive legal uncertainty about the applicable law and complicates out-of-court settlements.98 Environmental protection is special, however, Rev.

Applying only the law of the place of injury would not deter potential tortfeasors from exploiting a lower level of environmental protection in a neighbouring country for their own profit.100 Deterring "law shopping" in such scenarios is not merely an ex pression of a sympathy for the weaker party, but a sensible economic choice that forces polluters to internalise the full cost of negative environmental externalities created by their activities.101 In this respect, although Art. 7 Rome II deviates from the policy-neutral, jurisdiction-selecting Savignian paradigm, it is still justified by the overriding goal of enhancing the eco nomic efficiency of transnational tort litigation. b) Ubiquity for reasons of procedural economy Although the German or Italian theories of ubiquity have frequently been classified as a kind of substantivist better-law-approach, the normative bases of ubiquity are in fact more multi-layered.102 In complex scenarios in which a single event causes damages in a multitude of countries, a pure mosaic ap proach to determining the applicable law by reference to the places of injury puts a significant burden on the litigating parties and the courts.103 Calculat ing damages in accordance with 5, 10 or more laws is a very challenging, time-consuming and costly task. In such situations, it is justified not for reasons of substantive justice, but for the sake of procedural economy and the ease of litigation to grant the victim the right to opt for the law at the place of acting.104 This simple economic rationale is also the normative foundation for the rule on cartel damages in Art. 6(3)(b) Rome II:105 When a market is affected by a restriction of competition in more than one country, the victim 99 Von Hein, G?nstigkeitsprinzip 121. 100 Explanation of the Commission's Proposal of 2003, 329. 101 Garcimart?n Alf?rez 1-87; for a full-blown economic analysis, see Nicita/Winkler (supra n.27). 102 Von Hein, G?nstigkeitsprinzip 78-87 (comparing G?nstigkeitsprinzip and better law approach), 139?141 (differentiating between normative justifications for favouring the plain tiff). 103 Von Hein, G?nstigkeitsprinzip 141. 104 Von Hein, G?nstigkeitsprinzip 141. 105 Cf.

It would be a welcome progress if this approach could one day be extended to violations of the right of personality as well, because the economic rationale is the same in these cases. This would also enhance consistency between Rome II and Brussels I, as it would in substance be a transposition of the ECJ's Shevill-doctrine from the jurisdictional context to private interna tional law.106 IV. Personal Connecting Factors: Common Habitual Residence and what else? The lex loci damni (Art. 4(1) Rome II) is displaced in cases where the per son claimed to be liable and the person sustaining the damage both have their habitual residence in the same country at the time when the damage occurs (Art. 4(2) Rome II). This rule is familiar to many European codifica tions.107 Again, it is a legitimate expression of the basic economic rationale underlying the Regulation: "[I] most cases the common residence rule guarantees lower litigation costs, more efficient court administration, and international harmony of decisions."108 The notion of habitual residence is only defined for special cases in Art. 23 Rome II (corporations, businesspeo ple); for other scenarios (e.g. tourists involved in a traffic accident) the term has to be interpreted in an autonomous way.109 Since Art. 4(2) Rome II focuses only on a common habitual residence "in the same country", cases may arise in which both parties have a common habitual residence within the EU, but not in the same Member State, and 106 For a transposition of the Shevill doctrine to private international law, see von Hein, G?nstigkeitsprinzip 337?340; for other proposals, see the collection of authorities supra n.46. 107 E.g.

Syme onides has put forward the example of a French tourist wounding a Belgian tourist while both participate in a hunting party in Kenya.110 He has argued that in such a case Kenyan law should be displaced because French and Bel gian tort law are substantially similar.111 It has been proposed to apply Art. 4(2) by way of an analogy to such a scenario.112 This solution raises methodological concerns, however.113 First of all, it is questionable whether the Rome II Regulation suffers from a lacuna in this respect because the Parliament's proposal for including an escape clause for cases in which the substantive laws of the parties' states of habitual residence are substantially the same was rejected in the further course of legislation.114 Moreover, a weighing of the pros and cons of such a solution is better left to the general escape clause contained in Art. 4(3) Rome II.115 The question is whether the union citizenship (Arts. 17, 18 EC) shared by the parties can be integrated into the search for a more closely connected legal order (see infra V. 2.). V. Certainty v. Flexibility: The Escape Clause 1. A tale of two escape clauses: Rome II and Rome I The questions as to whether and, if so, how to codify an escape clause turned out to be ? in different degrees ? highly controversial issues in the preparation of both the Rome II and the Rome I Regulation, although the final versions of both Regulations do not differ very significantly from es cape clauses that already existed in national codifications or in Art. 4(5) of the Rome Convention. As Recital No. 14 of the Rome II Regulation shows, the reason for the difficulties in drafting escape clauses in European private international law is the tension between "the requirement of legal certain ty", on the one hand, and the "need to do justice in individual cases", on the other. Although both Regulations face this structural dilemma, their legis lative history did not evolve along parallel trajectories. With regard to the Rome II Regulation, it was always undisputed that an escape clause was needed; only the contents, especially the degree of necessary specifications, was controversial.116 The drafting of the escape clause proved to be the main battleground between those who, like Diana Wallis, wanted to introduce 110 Symeonides 196. 111 Symeonides 196. 112 De Lima Pinheiro 18. 113 Cf.

S.-inspired, substantivist and issue-specific approaches to European pri vate international law and those who preferred traditional Savignian con cepts that are basically policy-neutral and jurisdiction-selecting.117 At the end of the day, however, the escape clause finally codified in Art. 4(3) Rome II has a distinctly European flavour, allowing the court to displace the law designated by Art. 4(1) or (2) if the tort is manifestly more closely connected with another country. Although its wording may be a bit ambiguous, Art. 4(3) Rome II also allows for a return to the lex loci damni in cases where the common habitual residence (Art. 4(2) Rome II) is superseded by additional factors which lead to a closer connection with the place of inju ry.118 As an example, Art. 4(3), 2nd sentence Rome II provides that such a manifestly closer connection might in particular be based on a pre-existing relationship between the parties, such as a contract, that is closely connected with the tort in question. This principle of an accessory connection is well known from recent European codifications of tort conflicts.119 While the controversy surrounding the drafting of the escape clause in the Rome II Regulation was triggered by a parliamentary proposal that extended the escape clause beyond the limits of the traditional Savignian approach,120 the discussion with regard to Rome I was sparked by a Com mission proposal headed precisely in the opposite direction, i.e. one that suggested a radical departure from the model of the Rome Convention. Ac cording to the draft for a Rome I Regulation of 2005, the escape clause should have been abolished completely.121 The Commission justified this truly revolutionary change by pointing out that the escape clause had been used too liberally by the courts of the Member States, thus endangering legal certainty.122 The Commission's proposal met with unanimous academic criticism on this point, however.123 After the final Rome II Regulation of 117 See von Hein, Something (supra . 16) 1168 et seq. 118 Stone 115 remains sceptical on this point. 119 E.g.

It was even more plausible to grant courts some latitude with regard to contractual obligations because in this area parties could in most cases easily restore legal certainty by drafting an ex ante choice of law clause under Art. 3 Rome I whereas the scope for ex ante party autonomy is, for both practical and legal reasons, more limited for non-contractual obligations (Art. 14(l)(b) Rome II). 2. Interpreting the escape clause of the Rome II Regulation Since Parliament's attempts to "Americanise" the escape clause of the Rome II Regulation failed, Art. 4(3) Rome II has to be interpreted in ac cordance with established European conflicts methodology.124 First, the closer connection has to be determined holistically for "the tort/delict" in question, not just for a single issue such as loss-regulation.125 Secondly, Art. 4(3) Rome II is just as jurisdiction-selecting as the general, hard-and fast rules contained in Art. 4(1) and (2) Rome II; it leaves no room for a substantivist better-law approach.126 Other factors are harder to evaluate. In cases where parties who share a common union citizenship and who have their common habitual residence in the territory of the Community are involved in an accident that has happened in a third state (e.g. in Symeo nides' safari hypothetical),127 it may be argued that a closer connection to one of the Member States in question exists.128 (2006) 331-349 (338-340); Ole Lando /Peter Amt Nielsen, The Rome I Proposal: J.

Contrary to some previous European codifications,129 Art. 4(1) Rome II does not limit the connection with the place of injury to scenarios in which the person claimed to be liable could reasonably foresee that his actions might give rise to a damage suffered in another country.130 As Recital No. 6 and the provision on product liability (Art. 5(1), 2nd sen tence) of the Rome II Regulation show, however, the notion of foreseeabil ity is not alien to the Regulation. Accordingly, it is not illegitimate to take account of this factor under Art. 4(3) Rome II as well.131 An even more challenging methodological issue arises from the exclusion of renvoi in Art. 24 Rome II. A complete ban on renvoi in cases involving Member States that are parties to the HCTA frustrates any attempt to achieve an intra-community harmony of decisions in such cases. Thus, the question merits serious consideration whether the position of a state party to the HCTA may at least be taken into account in determining the applicable law under Art. 4(3) Rome II.132 In light of the overarching goal of international decisional harmony within the European Area of Justice, this question should be answered in the affirmative. Finally, one may pose the question as to whether the general goal of re ducing the cost of litigation (see supra II. 1. a) is a legitimate factor in weigh ing the relevant connections with various countries under Art. 4(3) Rome II.133 Such considerations must be viewed with scepticism, however, because the intention underlying the Rome II Regulation is "to designate the same national law irrespective of the country of the court in which an action is brought" (Recital No, 6). This legislative aim would be severely undermined if a court could legitimise recourse to its own lex fori merely because this law is cheaper to ascertain and to apply to a given case.134 It is to be expected that the ECJ will act as a watchdog against such "homing instincts" of the Mem ber States'judges.

Kadner Graziano, Environment (supra n. 91) 73; Kozyris 495 (stressing that the reference to the place of injury under Art. 7 Rome II does not depend on its foreseeability). 132 See von Hein, Ausweichklausel 568 et seq. 133 Von Hein, Ausweichklausel 569?571. 134 Von Hein, Ausweichklausel 570 et seq.</page><page sequence="26">486 JAN VON HEIN RabelsZ VI. Respecting the Free Will of the Parties: Party Autonomy 1. Party autonomy ex ante and ex post Party autonomy is today overwhelmingly regarded as not only a "stop gap", as Kegel had famously put it,135 but rather as a fundamental principle of attachment.136 This is true for European private international law as well.137 Article 14 Rome II contains a modern and liberal approach to party auton omy for non-contractual obligations:138 Whereas the Commission's original proposal of 2003 had limited party autonomy for non-contractual obliga tions to agreements entered into after the event giving rise to the damage occurred,139 following several European codifications in this regard,140 in 2005 the Parliament had proposed granting parties the right to choose the applicable law ex ante, too, provided that both of them pursued a commer cial activity and had equal bargaining power.141 The latter criterion was deemed to be too difficult to ascertain and was subsequently dropped.142 The provision of the final Regulation now differentiates between professionals and consumers: An ex post agreement on the applicable law is possible for all parties, whether in a Business-to-Consumer (B2C), Business-to-Business (B2B) or Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) transaction (Art. 14(1)(a) Rome II).

With regard to formal requirements, Art. 14(1), 2nd sentence Rome II is rather generous: The agreement must either be expressed or demonstrated with reasonable certainty. It is controversial, though, whether a choice-of law clause contained in standard terms of business is sufficient under Art. 14(l)(b) Rome II.143 The question has to be answered in the negative because an adhesion contract is, by way of definition, not "freely negotiat ed".144 Yet this does not mean that a choice of law clause in an adhesion contract is wholly irrelevant: If the parties have chosen a law applicable to their contract under Art. 3 Rome I by using a standard form contract, this choice may well serve as the foundation for an accessory connection pursu ant to Art. 4(3) Rome II.145 The difference between an "indirect" choice of law by way of an accessory connection and the "direct" agreement ex ante pursuant to Art. 14(l)(b) Rome II is that only the latter provision excludes judicial discretion: Under Art. 14(l)(b) Rome II, parties are free to choose whichever law they wish without having to establish that a close connection exists between their case and the chosen law.146 Article 14(1), 2nd sentence Rome II makes clear that rights of third parties, in particular insurance companies, remain unaffected by the choice between the parties. 2. Limitations in domestic and intra-community cases According to Art. 14(2) Rome II, parties may not derogate from inter nally mandatory laws in purely domestic cases. Contrary to Art. 3(3) of the Rome Convention, Art. 14(2) Rome II fails to state that internally manda tory rules cannot be derogated from in a purely domestic case even if the parties have entered into an agreement on jurisdiction.147 Although this la cuna must most probably be attributed to sloppy drafting and has no sub stantial consequences,148 Art. 3(3) Rome I now repeats this omission for the sake of formal consistency with Rome II, which in turn creates the neces 143 An adhesion contract is considered as sufficient by G. Wagner 13 et seq.; see also Ofner 22, who wants to answer this question in accordance with the chosen law under Art. 3 Rome I, a solution that is also pondered by Hay 1-151; cf. also Petch 453 (arguing in favour of an au tonomous concept). 144 Garcimart?n Alf?rez 1-82; Heiss/Loacker 623; Le?ble, Rechtswahl 260; de Lima P?nheiro 12; Rugull?s (supra . 138) 322; this also seems to be the position taken by Kozyris 484. 145 Cf. de Boer (supra n. 137) 27 (arguing that an accessory connection to a contract re mains possible even if an agreement is invalid under Art. 14(1) Rome I). 146 Garcimart?n Alf?rez 1-82; Le?ble, Rechtswahl 261; R?hl, Rechtswahlfreiheit 192. 147 I have tried to draw attention to this inconsistency, but without success, see von Hein, Abschluss 445; on the final Regulation, see Leible, Rechtswahl 262. 148 See Leible, Rechtswahl 262.</page><page sequence="28">488 JAN VON HEIN RabelsZ sity to clarify in Recital No. 15 of the Rome I Regulation that this change is not intended to have any importance whatsoever. Such nonsensical lin guistic harmonisation reminds even a benevolent observer of the dictum that "a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds".149 Article 14(3) Rome II extends the limitation found in Art. 14(2) to cases where the parties have chosen the law of a third state in a substantially intra Community case.150 In the latter scenario, the internally mandatory provi sions of community law apply as implemented in the Member State of the forum.151 This solution may be criticised as doctrinally unsound because it deviates from the principle of international decisional harmony; from this perspective, it would have been more coherent to apply the law designated by the objective conflicts rules of the Rome II Regulation.152 Yet one has to admit that such doctrinal purity would come at a high price. Given that the respective laws of the Member States are at least minimally harmonised in cases covered by Art. 14(3) Rome II, applying a foreign law, which may not be easily accessible for linguistic reasons, would lead to higher costs that are hard to justify because the substantial outcome of the case will usually only marginally be affected. Thus, the preference for the lex fori in this specific context contributes to a considerable reduction of the costs of litigation and is a defensible legislative decision.153 It is therefore acceptable that Art. 4(4) Rome I now extends this solution to contracts. 3. Party autonomy for consumers From the very first draft of the Rome II Regulation, it was accepted that even consumers could enter into an agreement after the event giving rise to the damage occurred.154 Thus, consumers' freedom of choice was not de nied, but merely postponed in the case of tort conflicts.155 Contrary to that 149 Ralph Waldo Emerson, Self-Reliance (1841), &lt;http://www.emersoncentral.com/self reliance. htm&gt;. 150 'pjjg scenarios may, however, overlap; on the resulting problems, see de Lima Pinheiro 14. 151 Art. 14(3) of the Rome II Regulation does not refer to overriding mandatory provi sions in the sense of Art. 16 Rome II; see Carruthers / Crawford (supra n. 55) 91; but cf.

Wagner 13.</page><page sequence="30">490 JAN VON HEIN RabelsZ Whereas Art. 6(1) Rome I describes a "professional" as a "person acting in the exercise of his trade or profession", Art. 14(l)(b) Rome II talks more loosely of "parties pursuing a commercial activity", thus leaving room for a divergent interpretation of a key concept of both Regulations.162 Although Art. 14(l)(b) Rome II does not state explicitly that parties must pursue a commercial activity on a regular basis, this may be inferred from the provi sion's goal to protect legally unsophisticated parties from a choice-of-law clause with unforeseeable effects,163 thus excluding occasional C2C transac tions such as, for example, the sale of a used car.164 Saving consumers' party autonomy under Rome I has important reper cussions for Rome II as well: Although Art. 14(1) (a) Rome II limits con sumers' freedom of choice to the ex post situation, an ex ante agreement on the applicable law becomes de facto available for B2C transactions by way of an accessory connection, within the limits of Art. 6(2) Rome I. It has been argued that such a result is inconsistent and should be corrected by not al lowing an accessory connection in cases where the parties could not have chosen the applicable law directly under Art. 14 Rome II.165 On the other hand, courts will have to take the necessary degree of consumer protection into account in exercising their discretion under Art. 4(3) Rome II. Since the parties have entered into a basically valid agreement on choice of law for their contract, it seems disproportionate to categorically deny the possibility of an accessory connection in consumer cases. 4. Party autonomy with regard to non-state law Eventually, the legislator made another important decision with regard to the object of party autonomy in tort litigation which prejudiced the subse quent Rome I Regulation. It is undisputed with regard to Art. 14 Rome II that parties are limited to the choice of the law of a state.166 This follows from the wording of Art. 14(2) Rome II ("the country whose law has been chosen") and of Art. 24 Rome II ("the law of any country specified by this Regula tion").167 Contrary to the Commission's Rome I draft of 2005 (Art. 3(2)), but consistent with the Rome II Regulation, the final Rome I Regulation 162 Cf.

Although doctrinal consistency is a laudable goal in general, one may doubt that this issue really had to be resolved in the same way for tort and contract conflicts.169 With regard to the latter group of cases, soft law instruments such as the UNIDROIT Principles or the Principles of Euro pean Contract Law exist and have gained some acceptance in international arbitration.170 Compared to contract conflicts, however, principles for non contractual obligations were at a comparatively embryonic state in 2007, the year the Rome II Regulation was passed, and it is questionable whether the DCFR will substantially change this state of affairs. Moreover, one could have defended a limitation of party autonomy to state law for tort conflicts with the argument that, for many Member States, allowing party autonomy ex ante for torts was already a significant step forward whose practical results should be watched cautiously before party autonomy should be extended even further in this area. In light of these differences, it would have been reasonably justifiable to opt for a more liberal approach to the choice of non state law under Rome I than under Rome II. 5. Party autonomy under the Hague Conventions Contrary to the Rome II Regulation, the Hague Conventions on Traffic Accidents and Product Liability do not explicitly offer the possibility of choosing the law applicable to a non-contractual obligation, neither ex ante nor ex post. This has given rise to the question as to whether the law desig nated by the Hague Conventions may still be derogated from by an agree 168 It is beyond the scope of this paper to retrace the controversy for contract conflicts; for a most recent survey, see Wolfgang Ernst, Der "Common Frame of Reference" aus juristischer Sicht: AcP 208 (2008) 248-282 (263 et seq.); Dieter Martiny, Common Frame of Reference und Internationales Vertragsrecht: ZEuP 2007, 212-228. 169 But cf.

VII. Special Torts and culpa in contrahendo 1. Special torts a) The basic territorial connecting factors (I) Impact-oriented p. activity-oriented connections The evolution of tort conflicts has been characterised by various and often contradicting attempts to define the lex loci delicti.174 As I have described, supra III. 1, the Rome II Regulation opts for a general rule in favour of the place of injury. Nevertheless, as Recital No. 19 explains, "[sjpecific rules should be laid down for special torts/delicts where the general rule does not allow a reasonable balance to be struck between the interests at stake". On closer inspection, however, the rules governing special torts serve two dis tinct purposes: On the one hand, some rules favor an impact-oriented per spective as well but try to give a more precise definition of where the pro tected interest is located. With regard to the underlying values, these rules are basically in line with the approach supporting the general rule. Other rules, on the other hand, deliberately deviate from the place of injury and restore the place of acting as the decisive or at least as a supplemental con necting factor. 171 For closer analysis, see Hans Hoyer, Haager Stra?enverkehrs?bereinkommen und Rechtswahl der Parteien: ZRvgl. 32 (1991) 341-348, with a comprehensive collection of au thorities. 172 Cass. 19.4. 1988, Rev. crit. d.i.p. 78 (1989) 68 note Henri Batiffol = D. 1988, somm. 345 (Audit); OGH 26.1. 1995, ZRvgl. 36 (1995) 212; OGH 30.1. 2003, ZRvgl. 44 (2003) 148 (LS 2003/50). 173 Ofner 22; but cf. also Bri?re, R?glement 59 et seq. (distinguishing between the accord proc?dural available under French law of civil procedure and party autonomy as a conflicts rule under Art. 14 Rome II). 174 Recital No. 15.</page><page sequence="33">73 (2009) OF OLDER SIBLINGS AND DISTANT COUSINS 493 (2) Impact-oriented connections The first group of rules, which may be roughly labeled as modified im pact-oriented connections, comprise the basic rule on product liability (Art. 5(1), 1st sentence Rome II), the rules on unfair competition affecting more than one competitor (Art. 6(1) Rome II), and acts restraining free competition (Art. 6(3) Rome II) as well as the rule on infringements of an intellectual property right arising from national law (Art. 8(1) Rome II). With regard to product liability, Recital No. 20 states that "[t]he conflict of-law rule in matters of product liability should meet the objectives of fair ly spreading the risks inherent in a modern high-technology society, pro tecting consumers' health, stimulating innovation, securing undistorted competition and facilitating trade".175 In order to achieve these purposes, the Regulation opts for a cascade of connections, starting with the law of the country in which the person sustaining the damage had his or her habitual residence when the damage occurred, provided that the product was mar keted in that country (Art. 5(1) (a) Rome II). If that connection fails because the product was not marketed there, the law of the country in which the product was acquired governs, again provided that the product was mar keted in this state (Art. 5(1) (b) Rome II). Finally, if that fails as well, the Regulation returns to the lex loci damni under Art. 5(l)(c) Rome II, if the product was marketed there. This cascade of connections is evidently influ enced by the desire to protect the mobile consumer from being confronted with a law that may be purely accidental from his point of view because it has neither a relationship with the legal environment that he is accustomed to (his habitual residence) nor to the place where he decided to expose him self to the danger possibly emanating from the product (place of acquisi tion).176 The rule reflects the presumption that most consumers will be af fected by a defective product in the country where they are habitually resi dent.177 Insofar, although Art. 5(1) (a) and (b) Rome II technically deviate from the lex loci damni (Art. 4(1) Rome II), the specific rules are still fo 175 On product liability under Rome II, see in particular Peter Huber/Martin Himer, Inter national Product Liability, A Commentary on Article 5 of the Rome II Regulation: Yb.

Wagner 7.</page><page sequence="34">494 JAN VON HEIN RabelsZ cused on the impact of the tort on the legal and social sphere of the victim rather than on the place of acting.178 It is questionable, however, whether the cascade system codified in Art. 5(1) Rome II will actually lead to an efficient realisation of the aims spelled out in Recital No. 20. First of all, the focus on "consumer's health" is problematic because Art. 5(1) Rome II is not limited to B2C cases, but comprises claims raised by professionals as well.179 For B2B cases, however, in which parties may be presumed to be equally strong, favouring the victim by focusing on his or her habitual residence alone seems to be a rather unbal anced solution. Apart from that, concentrating on the victim's habitual resi dence alone will - in probably not a few cases - be out of step with the principle of actor sequitur forum rei underlying the Brussels I Regulation, be cause the victim may only sue the producer at the plaintiff's domicile if this coincides with the place where the harmful event occurred under Art. 5 No. 3 Brussels I.180 From an efficiency-oriented point of view, the place of acquisition, where the victim paid a price that reflects the local standards of liability and the pertinent insurance premiums, would have been a more convincing criterion both for B2C and B2B cases.181 This would moreover have had the advantage of fully realising the goal of "undistorted competi tion" declared in Recital No. 20. The rules on unfair competition and antitrust violations also reflect an impact-oriented approach.182 This is made clear by Recital No. 21, which states that "[t]he special rule in Article 6 is not an exception to the general rule in Article 4(1), but rather a clarification of it".183 With regard to unfair competition, the applicable law is the law of the country where competitive relations or the collective interests of consumers are, or are likely to be af fected (Art. 6(1) Rome II). As far as restrictions of competition are con cerned, the law of the affected market is decisive (Art. 6(3)(a) Rome II). Both rules are focused on the effects of unfair or anticompetitive behaviour, not on the place where the acts leading to such effects have been commit 178 In this sense, it is justified to call Art. 5 (1) Rome II a "modified lex loci rule", see Junker 3678 ("modifizierte Tatortregel"). 179 Garcimart?n Alf?rez 1-84. 180 Contra G.

In such cases, the applicable law is not determined by the relevant market ? which is, from a technical point of view, not "affect ed" by a purely bilateral violation of rules on fair competition -, but by the lex loci damni pursuant to Art. 4(1) Rome II.186 In addition, the law applicable to the infringement of intellectual prop erty rights is not submitted to the lex loci delicti but to the well-known lex loci protectionis, i.e. "the law of the country for which protection is claimed" (Art. 8(1) Rome II).187 In a wider sense, this rule can also be classified as fall ing within the basically impact-oriented paradigm.188 (3) Activity-oriented connections Although the Rome II Regulation discards the place of acting within the framework of the general rule (Art. 4(1) Rome II), this connecting factor continues to play an important role in the context of several special torts. First of all, even the ladder of connections determining the law applicable to product liability described above, supra VII. 1 a (2), is not purely impact oriented, but depends on a marketing of the product that must have been foreseeable from the point of view of the producer (Art. 5(1), 2nd sentence Rome II).189 From this angle, one could also classify Art. 5(1), 1st sentence Rome II as an activity-oriented connection, with the marketing of the 184 Hay 1-146; Lindacher (supra . 182) 454 et seq. 185 See the explanation for the Commission's Proposal of2003, 324 (all participants should "play the game by the same rules"); de Lima Pinheiro 23. 186 This puts an end to the long-standing controversy as to whether such a conflicts rule for bilateral cases is actually needed, see Lindacher (supra n. 182) 457-459, with further refer ences; but cf. the critical comments by Petch 511 ("This seems contrary to principle. Competi tion law exists to protect competition, not competitors."). 187 On the lex loci protectionis in Rome II, see, e.g., J?rgen Basedow/Axel Metzger, Lex loci protectionis europaea, in: Russland im Kontext der internationalen Entwicklung, FS Bo guslavskij (2004) 153-172; Eckart Gottschalk, The Law Applicable to Intellectual Property Rights, in: Conflict of Laws in a Globalized World, ed. by id. et al.

Wagner 7.</page><page sequence="36">496 JAN VON HEIN RabelsZ product being the relevant activity. Since marketing and foreseeability are, from a systematic point of view, codified as restrictive criteria to rules which are focused on the impact of the defective product, it seems, however, on the whole to be more appropriate to classify Art. 5(1), 1st sentence Rome II as a predominantly impact-oriented connection. Yet the second sentence of Art. 5(1) Rome II states that if the person claimed to be liable could not reasonably foresee the marketing of the product (or a product of the same type), the law of his or her habitual residence shall apply. This has to be characterised as a typified version of the place-of-acting approach because, under Art. 23 Rome II, the habitual residence is defined as either the place of central administration (for corporations) or as the principal place of busi ness (for a natural person acting in the course of his or her business). Thus, in the case of unforeseeable marketing, it is ensured that the producer will be judged in accordance with the standards prevailing at the centre of his commercial activities. The criterion of foreseeability and the preference for the habitual residence of the producer as a fallback rule can also be attributed to an economic rationale.190 Recital No. 20 clearly refers to the allocative function of a conflict rule on product liability, stating that it "should meet the objective of fairly spreading the risks inherent in a modern high-tech nology society". If a producer cannot foresee the marketing of a product or a product of the same type in a certain country, he or she will not take this law into account when he or she makes decisions on the manufacturing process or the conclusion of pertinent insurance contracts.191 Consequently, an application of the rules of liability which are in force in this country would not fulfill the function of determining the level of care or the neces sary insurance expected from the producer.192 The place of acting is also restored as an alternative connecting factor in the context of environmental damage (Art. 7 Rome II) and, in the guise of the defendant's domicile, for multi-state anticompetitive torts (Art. 6(3) (b) Rome II); both articles constitute the "remnants of ubiquity" that have al ready been discussed, supra III.4. Finally, the place of acting completely displaces the generally impact-ori ented approach of the Rome II Regulation with regard to two specific types of tort: Firstly, in the case of a non-contractual obligation arising from an infringement of a unitary Community intellectual property right, the law applicable shall, for any question that is not governed by the relevant Com munity instrument, be the law of the country in which the act of infringe ment was committed (Art. 8(2) Rome II).193 In this scenario, the lex loci 190 Cf., in the context of German PIL, von Hein, G?nstigkeitsprinzip 211 et seq. 191 Von Hein, G?nstigkeitsprinzip 211 et seq. 192 Von Hein, G?nstigkeitsprinzip 211 et seq. 193 This is criticised by G. Wagner 9, who would have preferred a recourse to the lex loci damni; cf. also Le?ble /Lehmann 731.</page><page sequence="37">73 (2009) OF OLDER SIBLINGS AND DISTANT COUSINS 497 damni would frequently not allow a clear and unequivocal connection of the non-contractual obligation with a single country in multi-state cases.194 Sec ondly, Art. 9 Rome II contains a specific rule on industrial actions such as strikes or lock-outs which declares the law of the country where the action is to be, or has been, taken as applicable.195 Again, the drafters of the Regu lation were concerned with the issue of foreseeability here: it was feared that a pure lex loci damni approach to industrial actions would severely under mine workers' and employers' rights because a strike or lock-out may lead to significant economic damages in a multitude of countries .196 In sum, the place of acting continues to play a role for various normative reasons: First of all, it may be legitimised by the need to take the tortfeasor's interest in the foreseeability of the applicable law into account, i.e. to ensure the allocative and conduct-regulating function of tort law (product liability, industrial action). Secondly, it may be added as an additional factor for rea sons of substantive justice, i.e. to avoid negative external effects (environ mental damage). Thirdly, it may come into play for reasons of procedural economy (acts restraining competition). Finally, it is used as a last resort where an impact-oriented connection would frequently not lead to practical results (infringement of European IP rights). Although the reasons behind these exceptions to the general rule (Art. 4(1) Rome II) may at first blush appear disparate, they can, at closer inspection, all be attributed to the over arching goal of increasing the efficiency of transnational tort litigation. b) Habitual residence The rules governing special torts differ significantly with regard to the relevance of a common habitual residence of tortfeasor and victim. On the one hand, there are specific rules which may be displaced by a common habitual residence. The rules on product liability (Art. 5(1) Rome II) and on industrial action (Art. 9 Rome II) state clearly that they apply "[w]ithout prejudice to Article 4(2)".197 Likewise, acts of unfair competition affecting exclusively the interest of a specific competitor are subject to Art. 4(2) Rome II by way of the reference contained in Art. 6(2) Rome II. 194 On the undesirability of having a multiplicity of laws to deal with infringements of IP rights see Perteg?s (supra n. 187) 246. 195 On industrial action under Rome II, see in particular Stein Evju, Grenz?berschrei tender Arbeitskampf auf Schiffen und Rechtswahl: RIW 2007, 898-908; Oliver L.

Huber/Himer (supra . 175) 45; Stone 121; G. Wagner 7; on in dustrial action, see Heiss/Loacker 637; the reference to the common habitual residence in Art. 9 Rome II is criticised as inappropriate by Kn?fel (supra n. 195) 237 et seq.</page><page sequence="38">498 JAN VON HEIN RabelsZ The remaining specific rules, on the other hand, must not be connected to a common habitual residence of the parties. This is true for unfair competi tion in general (Art. 6(1) Rome II), antitrust violations (Art. 6(3) Rome II), environmental damage (Art. 7 Rome II) and the infringement of IP rights (Art. 8 Rome II). The reasons for excluding the common habitual residence as a connecting factor are different within the latter group of cases. With re gard to unfair competition and antitrust, a connection with the common habitual residence of the parties would have a detrimental effect on the prin ciple of treating all competitors equally (par conditio concurrentium) .198 In com parison with Art. 6 Rome II, the preference for common habitual residence in Art. 5(1) Rome II is all the more remarkable, because "securing undis torted competition" is also put forward as a goal underlying the conflicts rule on product liability in Recital No. 20.199 In cases involving environmental damage, denying the victim's right to choose the law more favourable to him or her in cases where he or she shares a habitual residence with the tortfeasor would be incompatible with the favor naturae underlying this rule.200 As far as IP rights are concerned, a reference to the common habitual residence of the parties would contradict the territorial limitation of such rights.201 c) Availability of the escape clause The specific rules offer a rather heterogenous picture as well with regard to the availability of the escape clause. With regard to product liability, Art. 5(2) Rome II contains a specific escape clause that closely mirrors the general escape clause found in Art. 4(3) Rome II. Recourse to the general escape clause is possible for acts of unfair competition affecting exclusively the interests of a specific competitor, because the general reference to Art. 4 Rome II contained in Art. 6(2) Rome II encompasses the escape clause as well. Apart from that, however, a court may not have recourse to the closer connection in the context of special torts. With regard to unfair competition (Art. 6(1) Rome II), antitrust (Art. 6(3) Rome II), environmental damage (Art. 7 Rome II) and the infringement of IP rights (Art. 8 Rome II), the reasoning for an exclusion of the escape clause is analogous to that leading to the non-applicability of Art. 4(2) Rome II for these types of torts (see supra VII. 1 a [2]). It is more difficult to see why the general escape clause is not available for industrial actions (Art. 9 Rome II),202 although common ha 198 Lindacher (supra . 182) 455 199 The habitual residence rule is criticised as inappropriate for product liability cases by Kozyris 490. 200 Garcimartin Alf?rez 1-87. 201 Basedow /Metzger 161; Gottschalk 196 et seq. (both supra . 187). 202 As a matter of positive law, this seems to be uncontroversial, see Heiss/Lo acker 637; Le?ble/Lehmann 732; G. Wagner 10.</page><page sequence="39">73 (2009) OF OLDER SIBLINGS AND DISTANT COUSINS 499 bitual residence remains a decisive connecting factor for such cases. Perhaps the drafters thought that allowing for a court's discretion in determining the closest connection in such cases would be difficult to reconcile with the politically sensitive nature of these torts. Having only two hard-and-fast blackletter rules relieves courts from any suspicion that they may resort to the escape clause for political reasons. As a consequence, though, courts must not take a "centre-of-gravity" approach to multiple acts constituting, for example, a cross-border strike.203 d) Party autonomy The rules governing special torts diverge insofar as they may be derogated from by a choice of law agreement between the parties. From a systematic point of view, the Regulation seems to offer a clear picture: Party autonomy is available for product liability cases (Art. 5 Rome II), environmental dam age (Art. 7 Rome II) and industrial actions (Art. 9 Rome II). On the other hand, parties are explicitly denied a choice of the applicable law in cases in volving unfair competition and acts restraining free competition (Art. 6(4) Rome II) as well as for the infringement of IP rights (Art. 8(3) Rome II). Allowing party autonomy in the latter groups of cases might create negative external effects on the relevant markets or for the protection of IP rights.204 In spite of this seemingly clear-cut dividing line, three types of torts have given rise to conflicting interpretations. First of all, it has been argued that party autonomy should not be extended to claims for environmental damage under Art. 7 Rome II because this would be incompatible with the goal underlying this rule, i.e. guaranteeing a high level of environmental protec tion.205 Yet this argument is unconvincing both from a normative as well as from a pragmatic perspective.206 If the victim may choose unilaterally a law that is not the most stringent one, but which may offer other advantages (e. g. being easily accessible, amenable to full judicial review on appeal, or sim ply giving a clear-cut answer to the question that is litigated), it is hard to see why he or she should be forbidden from agreeing on a bilateral choice of law clause under Art. 14 Rome II. Moreover, allowing bi- or multilateral choice of law agreements facilitates the settlement of multi-state cases.207 203 Kn?fel (supra . 195) 237; contra Le?ble /Lehmann 731. 204 Cf., however, the critical comment by de Boer (supra n. 137) 25 et seq.

Secondly, Art. 6(4) Rome II talks of the whole Art. 6 Rome II ("under this article'), not merely o? paragraphs 1 and 3 of Art. 6 Rome II. Moreover, the carve-out for bilateral cases of unfair competition is of dubious legiti macy and should not be extended without good reason (singularia non sunt extendenda) .210 Finally, some authors have argued that party autonomy should be denied for industrial actions because of the overriding social interests at stake.211 Although party autonomy may not be a very practical option in this group of cases, its total exclusion would be clearly incompatible with the law as its stands.212 2. Culpa in contrahendo The rules on culpa in contrahendo in the Rome II Regulation (Art. 2(1), Art. 12 Rome II) are of particular interest because they highlight the diffi culties of creating communitarised conflicts rules for institutions of substan tive law that are not familiar to all legal systems of the Member States.213 Moreover, the rules on pre-contractual liability offer perhaps one of the most vivid examples of the legislator's desire to ensure consistency with the 208 De Boer (supra . 137) 24 et seq.; Le?ble/Lehmann 730 et seq.; R?hl, Rechtswahlfreiheit 202; G.

After the ECJ had decided to characterise claims aris ing from the breakdown of contractual negotiations as being of a non-con tractual nature within the context of demarcating the scope of Art. 5 No. 1 and 3 of the Brussels I Regulation,214 it was to be expected that the line be tween Rome II and Rome I would be drawn in the same way.215 Article 12(1) Rome II contains a specific rule on culpa in contrahendo under which the law applicable to a non-contractual obligation arising out of dealings prior to the conclusion of a contract, regardless of whether the contract was actually concluded or not, shall be the law that applies to the contract ? un der the Rome I Regulation ? or that would have been applicable to it had it been entered into. This specific rule, which, in the second alternative, leads to a form of accessory connection to a hypothetical contract, is necessary or at least helpful because the final version of Art. 4(3), 2nd sentence Rome II only gives a "pre-existing relationship between the parties, such as a contract" as an example for an accessory connection.216 For cases in which the law cannot be determined under Art. 12(1) Rome II, Art. 12(2) Rome II repeats the rules well-known from Art. 4 Rome II: lex loci damni (Art. 12(2)(a) Rome II), common habitual residence (Art. 12 (2) (b) Rome II) and a general escape clause (Art. 12 (2) (c) Rome II). Although letters a to c are merely linked by the word "or", the connections are neither meant to operate in an alternative fashion nor as a ladder of connections with letter a as the first rung (cf. Art. 5(1) Rome II);217 they are rather to be handled in the same way as Art. 4(1) to (3) Rome II, i.e. that common habitual residence (Art. 12(2)(b) Rome II) comes first; failing that, lex loci damni (Art. 12 (2) (a) Rome II); and both rules may be displaced by the escape clause (Art. 12(2)(c)).218 In spite of the rather detailed regulation of culpa in contrahendo, the issue of characterisation remains problematic.219 Recital No. 30 specifies that culpa in contrahendo has to be understood as an "autonomous concept" for the purposes of the Rome II Regulation. The Recital states that this notion should include the violation of the duty of disclosure and the breakdown of 214 ECJ 17. 9. 2002 - Case C-334/00 (Tacconi./. Heim. Wagner), . CR. 2002, 1-7357; on the academic reception of this judgment, see the survey by von Hein, Culpa (previous note) 58 et seq., with further references. 215 Von Hein, Culpa (supra . 213) 58 et seq.; but cf. the critical comment by G.

The Recital then makes the important qualifica tion that Art. 12 Rome II "covers only non-contractual obligations present ing a direct link with the dealings prior to the conclusion of a contract". Where such a "direct link" is lacking, e.g. "if, while a contract is being ne gotiated, a person suffers personal injury", the applicable law shall be deter mined by Art. 4 or other relevant provisions of the Rome II Regulation. This means that typical examples where German courts had recourse to culpa in contrahendo to compensate for the shortcomings of German tort law, e.g. the famous case of a customer slipping on a wet leaf of salad in a store,220 will have to be characterised as torts, pure and simple, and will thus not even come within the scope of Art. 12.221 Apart from such rather simple scenarios, however, the development of an "autonomous", European con cept of culpa in contrahendo remains a daunting task. In particular, it is still rather unclear which group of cases the legislators had in mind when they drafted Art. 12(2) Rome II. It follows from Recital No. 30 that Art. 12(2) Rome II cannot be read as referring to the salad-leaf-cases just mentioned, because these are already covered by Art. 4 Rome II. Thus, there must be a group of obligations which present a "direct link" with the negotiations on a contract, but which may nevertheless not be connected with the law gov erning the hypothetical contract under Art. 12(1) Rome II. One could im agine cases in which negotiations break down before the parties have at least tentatively agreed on the law applicable to their intended contract under Art. 3 Rome I222 or in which there is no clear agreement because of a "battle of the forms".223 In such scenarios, however, one could have recourse to the law that would have governed the envisioned contract under Art. 4 Rome I.224 If even that is impossible, because the characteristic performance has not been defined yet,225 it is difficult to imagine that the negotiations between the parties could have actually reached a stage where a breakdown would be contrary to good faith anyway.226 Article 12(2) Rome II may have a role to play in cases in which third parties either base their claim on culpa in cont rahendo or are sued on this ground because applying the law governing a hypothetical contract in relations to persons who would not have been par ties to such a contract even if it had actually been concluded might raise concerns with regard to the foreseeability of the applicable law.227 220 BGH 28.1. 1976, BGHZ 66, 52 (57). 221 Le?ble/Lehmann 733; G.

The residual sphere of domestic PIL rules Since the Rome II Regulation does not cover important areas of transna tional tort litigation such as, for example, certain matters involving corpo rate law (Art. 1(1) (d) Rome II), nuclear damage (Art. l(2)(f) Rome II) and violations of privacy (Art. 1(2) (g) Rome II), domestic PIL rules will not become completely obsolete.228 The German legislator, for example, has kept the unchanged Arts. 40-42 of the EGBGB on the books while alerting the judge to the primacy of the Rome II Regulation in a new Art. 3 No. 1 of the EGBGB.229 In order to ensure doctrinal consistency between domes tic and European private international law, however, adjusting the domestic PIL rules to the essential structure of the Rome II Regulation would have been a more sensible approach. The German legislator could have easily adapted Art. 40 EGBGB by giving preference to the place of injury rather than to the place of acting. Likewise, Art. 42 EGBGB could have been re formed in order to allow for an ex ante choice of law for torts not covered by the Rome II Regulation as well. Both proposals have been on the table in the German discussion for a long time.230 Insofar, the entry into force of the Rome II Regulation has been a missed opportunity to substantially modernise domestic PIL rules. VIII. Taming the Unruly Horse: Public Policy and Mandatory Provisions 1. Public policy Public policy has famously been described as a "very unruly horse".231 On the other hand, it has been argued that "[w]ith a good man in the saddle, the unruly horse can be kept in control."232 Public policy clauses in suprana tional instruments are particularly dangerous because, if they are framed too 228 Contra Rauscher/Pabst (supra . 5) 251. 229 Gesetz zur Anpassung der Vorschriften des Internationalen Privatrechts an die Verord nung (EG) Nr. 864/2007 of 10.12. 2008, BGBl.

K., however.239 At the end of the day, the final Rome II Regula tion merely contains a general clause on the public policy "of the forum" (Art. 26 Rome II). Recital No. 32 clarifies that courts remain free to con sider non-compensatory exemplary or punitive damages of an excessive na 233 See, e.g., Jan von Hein, Recent German Jurisprudence on Cooperation with the United States in Civil and Commercial Matters, in: Conflict of Laws in a Globalized World (supra n.38) 101-125 (110 et seq.). 234 Regulation (EC) No. 805/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 creating a European Enforcement Order for uncontested claims, O.J. 2004 L 143/15, Regulation (EC) No. 1896/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 creating a European order for payment procedure, O.J. 2006 L 399/1, Regulation (EC) No. 861/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2007 establishing a European Small Claims Procedure O.J. 2007 L 199/1, Gerhard Hohloch, Zur Bedeutung des Ordre public-Arguments im Vollstreckbarerkl?rungsverfahren, in: Die richtige Ordnung 809-818. 235 See supra II.2. 236 por comprehensive surveys, see, e.g. Burkhard Hess, Aktuelle Brennpunkte des transat lantischen Justizkonflikts: Die AG 2006, 897-818; Rolf A.

Likewise, the Rome I Regula tion confines itself to a general clause on public policy (Art. 21 Rome I). 2. Mandatory rules The Rome Convention contained a double-barrelled rule on internation ally mandatory rules in Art. 7, with the first paragraph of this provision re ferring to mandatory rules of other states and its second paragraph referring to mandatory rules of the forum. This provision was controversial in two respects: First of all, some Member States ? among them Germany and the U.K. ? had entered a reservation against Art. 7(1) of the Rome Conven tion.240 During the preparation of Rome II, especially Great Britain was not enthusiastic about the prospect of codifying a similar rule in a European Regulation.241 Article 16 of the final Rome II Regulation merely empowers the court in question to apply the "overriding mandatory provisions" of the forum.242 The provision is silent, however, both with regard to foreign man datory provisions and with regard to a precise definition of mandatory rules, merely referring to provisions that "are mandatory irrespective of the law otherwise applicable to the non-contractual obligation". As far as Art. 7(2) of the Rome Convention was concerned, it was widely felt that the concept of mandatory rules was framed too widely and needed clarification.243 Arti cle 9 Rome I now follows a more differentiated approach.244 First of all, it contains a more precise definition of "overriding mandatory provisions" in Art. 9(1) Rome I, which refers to "provisions the respect for which is re garded as crucial by a country for safeguarding its public interests, such as its political, social or economic organisation, to such an extent that they are applicable to any situation falling within their scope, irrespective of the law otherwise applicable to the contract".245 Although the comparatively vague wording of Art. 16 Rome II would leave room for a more generous interpre 240 See the collection of references in Internationales Privat- und Verfahrensrecht14, ed. by Erik Jayme/Rainer Hausmann (2009) No. 70, p. 149, . 12. 241 On the British perspective, see, e.g., Peter Stone, Der Vorschlag f?r die Rom Ii-Verord nung ?ber das auf au?ervertragliche Schuldverh?ltnisse anzuwendende Recht: EuLF 4 (2004) 213-230 (224). 242 As a practical example, see, e.g. the recent decision by Cass., 2e civ., 25.1. 2007, D. 2007, 578 (characterising rules allowing victims of criminal offences to draw compensation from a French public fund as being of an internationally mandatory nature); cf. Bri?re, R?gle ment 67. 243 See, e.g., Max Planck Institute (supra n. 123) 313?317; Karsten Thorn, Eingriffsnormen, in: Ein neues Internationales Vertragsrecht f?r Europa (supra . 123) 129-149 (131-139). 244 For a first assessment of Art. 9 Rome I, see Sonnenberger (supra n. 12) 241?243. 245 The provision is evidently inspired by ECJ 23.11. 1999 ? joined cases C-369/96 and C-376/96 (Arblade), E.C.R. 1999, 1-8453, para. 30.</page><page sequence="46">506 JAN VON HEIN RabelsZ tation under the lex fori,246 the official title of this provision ("overriding mandatory provisions") and Recital No. 7 (consistency with Rome I) indi cate that Art. 16 Rome II should be interpreted in accordance with the au tonomous definition given in Art. 9(1) Rome I.247 Contrary to Art. 16 Rome II, Art. 9(3) Rome I still empowers courts to give effect to foreign mandatory rules. Deviating from Art. 7(1) of the Rome Convention, however, Art. 9(3) Rome I limits this possibility to mandatory rules in force at the place of performance. Several authors have inferred from the absence of a specific provision on foreign mandatory rules in the Rome II Regulation that, contrary to cases falling under Rome I, judges must not consider such rules in tort cases.248 Yet such a mechanical reasoning would lead to hardly convincing results.249 With regard to the Rome Convention, it was generally held that the reservations entered against its Art. 7(1) did not bar courts in the states concerned from taking into account foreign manda tory laws.250 Likewise, it is more appropriate to interpret the silence of the Rome II Regulation in the sense that the question should be left to the fur ther development of European jurisprudence and conflicts doctrine.251 At the very least, one cannot possibly deny Member States' courts the right to continue the established practice of taking foreign mandatory rules into ac count as so-called moral data in the course of the application of their substan tive laws.252 IX. The Blind Spot: The Treatment of Foreign Law by the Courts of the Member States The communitarisation of private international law suffers from a blind spot: The procedural rules governing the pleading and proof of foreign law diverge considerably within the Member States, ranging from countries which treat foreign law as a mere fact (e.g. the U.K.) to national systems 246 Cf. Hay 1-149: "It seems that, as in the case of the public policy exception, each state decides for itself which of its rules are internationally mandatory"; on a possible divergence between Rome I and II, cf. Heiss/Loacker 644. 247 A practically identical result is reached by those authors who wish to apply directly the definition given by the ECJ 23.11. 1999 in the Arblade case (supra n. 245) see e.g. Bri?re, R? glement 66; Garcimarttn Alf?rez 1-90. 248 De Lima Pinheiro 32; Ofner 23; Staudinger, Rechtsvereinheitlichung 12; G. Wagner 15; cf. also Bri?re, R?glement 66: "Le juge saisi n'est donc tenu d'appliquer, au besoin d'office, que les lois de police de son for." 249 Von Hein, Abschluss 446; Heiss/Loacker 644; Le?ble /Lehmann 726. 250 See Kegel/Schurig (Schurig), IPR (supra . 135) 155; Kropholler, IPR (supra . 136) 508. 251 Von Hein, Abschluss 446; Heiss/Loacker 644; Le?ble /Lehmann 726; cf. also Sonnenberger (supra . 12) 242. 252 Garcimart?n Alf?rez 1-90; Heiss/Loacker 644; R?hl, Rechtswahlfreiheit 206 et seq.</page><page sequence="47">73 (2009) OF OLDER SIBLINGS AND DISTANT COUSINS 507 which oblige courts to determine the contents of foreign law ex officio (e. g. Germany).253 Article 1(3) of the Rome II and the Rome I Regulation ex plicitly state that the Regulations shall not apply to questions of procedure. Nevertheless, the divergent domestic rules on the treatment of foreign law threaten to undermine the basic economic rationale of the Regulations, i.e. ensuring an international harmony of decisions within the EU, irrespective of the forum in which the dispute is litigated. For this reason, the European Parliament had proposed inserting uniform rules concerning the treatment of foreign law into the Rome II Regulation, but this effort failed.254 The Commission was only willing to agree on a review clause (Art. 30(1) (i) Rome II) and to make a Statement on the treatment of foreign law which is attached to the text of the Rome II Regulation. In this Statement, the Com mission promises to publish a study on this issue four years after the entry into force of the Regulation at the latest. Although clear guidance from EC secondary law is thus lacking for the time being, one must not forget that the principle of effet utile is valid for the communitarisation of private interna tional law as well. Accordingly, systems that rest on a so-called facultative choice of law are arguably no longer compatible with existing EC legisla tion.255 In the medium-term perspective, the growing harmonisation of Eu ropean substantive private law will certainly raise the question as to wheth er it is still appropriate to treat the increasingly similar law of other Member States in the same way as non-harmonised third-state law. In this regard, the U.S. experience of distinguishing between the application of sister-state law, for which mandatory "judicial notice" is provided, and properly "for eign" law might offer some valuable insights for the EU as well.256 X. Conclusion and Outlook Coming back to the anthropomorphic metaphor I invoked in the intro duction, the Rome II Regulation assumes the role of the first-born in the family of EC Regulations on conflict of laws.

Perhaps the metaphor of relations among siblings provides another lesson for understanding the interplay of Rome I and II: Recent studies have led to the finding that - statistically speaking - first-borns tend to have a higher IQ than their younger siblings.260 One possible explanation for this result is the presumably higher degree of parental care given to older siblings while they are still the only children.261 Another hypothesis is that first-borns receive an improved training because they teach their younger siblings things they have learned themselves from their parents.262 Seen from this metaphorical perspective, the fact that Rome II served on many occa sions as a blueprint for the subsequently enacted Rome I Regulation is not only largely positive ? it is almost natural! One can only hope that Rome II's firm commitment to the values of "classic" European private international law will define the methodological paradigm underlying this area of law in the future. Moreover, a successful Europeanisation of the conflict of laws that effectively increases the efficiency of transnational litigation will surely have an impact on our American cousins as well. In this respect, the Rome II Regulation may be an important contribution not only to the communi tarisation but also to the globalisation of private international law.263 257 Sulloway (supra . 8) 351 (summarising empirical evidence on first-born scientists). 258 Cf.
