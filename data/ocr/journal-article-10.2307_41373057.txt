McHARG , MLA, MCP I Chairman , Department of Landscape Architecture and Regional Planning , University of Pennsylvania , delivered to the Society on Wednesday 6th June 1979 , with Dame Sylvia Crowe , PPI LA, in the Chair The Chairman: I am particularly happy to be here tonight as well as feeling honoured, because I have a very long association with both the speaker and the occasion. I remember Ian McHarg first in those heady days immediately after the war when the School of Planning in Gordon Square was busy turning soldiers into planners. It can claim many successes, but no success more dazzling than that of Major McHarg, who turned his parachute into a land- scape plan. We were sorry in many ways that we lost him to America, but in the end how we have benefited from that, because as Chairman and Professor of Landscape Architecture and Regional Planning at the University of Pennsyl- vania, he was able to give landscape training to our young landscape architects at a time when we were woefully deficient in opportunities in this country. A great many of our most dis- tinguished and now almost middle-aged land- scape architects are proud to call 'Penn' their alma mater. The esteem with which he is held in the United States is shown by the plethora of distinctions which he has gained there. I cannot recite them all : medals, honorary degrees, plans and reports for all kinds of places ; but of all his achievements I rate most highly the way that he has put ecological considerations at the base of all landscape planning. He has shown this in one project and report after another in the States and in many other countries of the world. Above all, he has set it out clearly in that magnificent book Design with Nature , which I think is some- thing of a Bible to all of us who try to do just that. I think we are extraordinarily fortunate that he has flown all the way from America, arriving yesterday and going back tomorrow, to talk to us tonight. The Reflection Riding Lectures were the brain-child of an American, John Chambliss. He endowed these lectures in memory of three men who did great service to landscape archi- tecture: Bradford Williams, who many of us remember for his long service to the American Association of Landscape Architects; Vaughn Cornish and John Gordon. All these men influenced the design of the delightful landscape park of Reflection Riding which lies under the shadow of Lookout Mountain in Tennessee. I am glad to say that Mr. Chambliss's daughter, Mrs. James Irvine, is in the audience this evening. I was privileged a long time ago (in 1 96 1 I think it was) to give the first of the Reflection Riding Lectures. Since then there have been a series of talks on subjects dealing with landscape and with gardens, all of them stimulating, all of them very much worth listening to, but none perhaps with such an intriguing title as the one we are to listen to tonight : ťThe Garden as a Metaphysical Symbol'. I cannot wait to hear what this entails ! The following lecture was then delivered .

Jellicoe, a founder of the Institute of Landscape Archi- tects, in the audience; he who advised the the speaker to study at Harvard and helped him to do so and was thus instrumental in his being invited to speak here under the auspices of the Reflection Riding Lecture endowed by an American of English descent who, entranced with a beautiful property at the foot of Lookout Mountain, Tennessee, sought to have the concept of husbandry and stewardship celebrated in an annual lecture ; whose daughter is in the audience tonight; all overlooked by a mural peopled by the historic figures who created western culture, conspicuous among whom is William Penn, founder of the State of Pennsylvania, source of the holy Quaker experiment, where the speaker now lives; and in the presence of a distinguished member of this Society, Benjamin Franklin, who maintained his membership in the Society throughout the Revolutionary War, and who founded the University of Pennsylvania, in which the speaker is a professor. INTRODUCTION The major proposition of this lecture is that society needs an explicit metaphysic, a world view which demonstrably corresponds to reality, which if understood, employed and applied, would better ensure human survival and wellbeing and point toward fulfilment. It suggests that the implicit metaphysical view of man and nature, which permeates all western society, is an anachronism which does not correspond to reality and may be the best guarantee of extinction. The address reviews metaphysical attitudes to God-Man- Nature and their expression in historic gardens, and concludes upon the degree to which these views do correspond to reality and contain survival value for to-day. It is submitted that the modern ecological view does indeed correspond to reality and has not only survival value but holds promise for a harmony of man-nature and the potential for symbolic expression - a new metaphysical symbolism. In the search for such a metaphysic, and its expression in the works of society, it is suggested that the divisions between science, art and religion constitute a major obstruc- tion. It recommends that in reviewing works, particularly of art, the generating metaphysic be first examined prior to any determination of the degree of skill employed in trans- mitting the message. That is, there can be profound statements, such as E=MC2 ex- pressed without lyricism ; there can be errors and falsehoods represented with moving power. I will suggest the Gardens of Versailles as such a case. The first example is superb knowledge transmitted without regard to art ; the second case involves a false metaphysic transmitted with great skill. We desperately need a valid metaphysic which permeates culture, and is expressed with great evocative art. I believe that this concern is appropriate to the Royal Society of Arts and as a subject of the Reflection Riding Lecture. The purpose of the Society is to encourage art, manufactures and com- merce. This could be reduced to art and science on the grounds that science begat technology which begat modern manufacture and commerce. But the commitment 'to encourage' reveals values. Such activities are seen as a public good to be encouraged. The Royal Society of Arts is also involved in values. I recommend that the Society actively encourage the unity of Art, Science and Values towards the end of developing, employing and expressing a metaphysic appropriate to our knowledge, to the quest for survival, success and fulfilment and that Art become the vehicle by which this meta- physic is transmitted and celebrated. The Reflection Riding Lecture is con- cerned with man's relation to nature and supports a preference for the steward or husbandman's view. This is a metaphysical view which is held by the writer and is developed in the address. METAPHYSICS AND SYMBOLS Webster defined metaphysics as a branch of science concerned with 'those things which relate to external nature' and, later 'the science of being and cosmology or the science of the fundamental causes and processes in things'. While metaphysics is a branch of science, concerned with cosmology and the fundamental causes and processes of things, religion is also concerned with cos- mology and has its own interpretations. Religion too is concerned with 'those things which relate to external nature', not least, man's relation to nature. So our concern with metaphysics inevitably involves both Science and Religion. But when the subject of inquiry is a metaphysical symbol we be- come involved in art. Webster defines symbol as 'a sign by which one knows or infers a thing' and later 'that which stands for or suggests something else by reason of associa- 133</page><page sequence="3">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS FEBRUARY I980 tion, convention or resemblance, a visible sign of something invisible ; as an idea, a quality or totality such as a state or a church, an emblem . . Л Visible signs and emblems involve Art. So, our inquiry involves consideration of science, religion and art. As these are en- compassing subjects the treatment of neces- sity must be broad, lacking exceptions, amplifications, and sources. It will be for- tunate if it is a consistent first approxima- tion. So simplification would seem appro- priate. We may, then, begin by reducing Science to its basic meaning, which is knowledge, Art to its basis, skill, and Religion to a concern with values. Our immediate concern is with meta- physical assumptions as to how the world works, assumptions of the attributes of God, man and nature and their interrelationships. Views on these matters have varied with cultures and time. Among these are the position of man in the universe. They include anthropocentrism (man at the centre of the universe), lococentrism, geocentrism (until Copernicus), helio centrism and now the modern view of the earth as a minor planet, orbiting an insignificant sun placed eccentrically in a commonplace galaxy among billions of those. Meanwhile anthro- pocentrism, dismissed by science, persists as the implicit view of the western world. Another realm of metaphysical inquiry involves the manifestation of God on earth. Here again various views are held. Animists, animitists and pantheists share the belief that God is manifest in all things and creatures. Polytheism discriminates and establishes hierarchies of natural deities; certain forms of polytheism included God-like men, while monotheism in Judaism and Christianity insists on one God, ťin whose image was man made'. Monotheism is anthropomorphic. All cultures have cosmologies but the two dominant western cosmologies are the crea- tion story in Genesis and the Big Bang theory of modern physics. If these are conflicting metaphysics represented by western religion and science, what of art ? With the advent of the modern age art became secular, divorced from religion, its subject matter and patron for centuries : yet art and religion were united in a preoccupa- tion with the immeasurable. Science drew boundaries defining science and religion and excluded art from its realm. It concentrated upon the measurable. Now, as we have seen, science is know- 134 ledge, art is basically skill, religion concerns itself with values. Can art exist without knowledge - can the senses alone motivate art without the intervention of the brain? Would a lobotomy improve art and artists ? Can science develop without skill ? - certainly technology cannot. And what are either with- out values ? Is religion oblivious to know- ledge and to skill ? The division has been formalized in education and practice; science is oblivious to art, art oblivious to science, both largely unconcerned with values in the theological sense. Moreover, the distinction between the measurable as scientific and the immeasur- able as the concern of art and religion is no longer clear. Much that was thought to be immeasurable has now been given dimen- sion - the cosmos and the atom, the elements, DNA, RNA, the realms of the brain which control discrete activities and emotions. The pursuit of the immeasurable as an act of discovery is now a function of science. What does society require from knowledge, skill and values ? What should a metaphysic provide? Surely, answers to a single com- pound question 'How does the world work ?' and 'How can I arrange my affairs to ensure survival, wellbeing and even fulfilment?'. The T in every case may be an individual, family, community, institution, nation-state or even the biosphere. In the Middle Ages this question was understood and the answer was clear. Scrip- ture tells us how the world works and instructs us on how to behave in order to ensure salvation - the measure of success. Religion, knowledge and art devoted them- selves to elaborate on these answers and to express the concern and commitment in the Church, in its liturgy, architecture, and music, and most importantly in moral behaviour. The relationship of the artist to society is epitomized for me in an imaginary conversa- tion between a representative of the Vintners who commissioned a stained glass window at Chartres, the artist and the Bishop. The Bishop told the artist to begin at the first chapter of Genesis and end with the last chapter of Revelations and make the entire message palpable - give form, colour and dimension to the characters and events of this central story. The artist was indispens- able. Only he could give substance and form to these people, places and events. Only he could justify the mortification, the pain, and the ecstasy of a pilgrimage to Chartres.</page><page sequence="4">FEBRUARY I980 THE GARDEN AS A METAPHYSICAL SYMBOL In the Renaissance the questions were extended to include the operation of the phenomenal world and the place of man within it. In this quest science quickly over- took both religion and art. But the values which were espoused by society continued to be reflected in its works. If the eternal question confronting man is indeed 'how does the world work ?' ; or ťhow can I best arrange my affairs to ensure survival, success and fulfilment?', then we can look to human artifacts to see what answers are represented and expressed. Subsumed in the question 'how does the world work ?' is an assumption about nature and man's relation to it. This question and answer can be illuminated by an examination of the garden. The garden has little function, it is a metaphor for man's relation to nature. It is at once a metaphysical symbol. It reveals an attitude to nature, a conception of world order. A metaphor involves employing the known to describe the unknown. Howard Nemerov, the American poet, records seeing unknown birds on his window sill. He consulted Peterson's handbook on birds without success. The nearest example was a purple finch. The comparison was inconclusive until he read a footnote which said, ťa purple finch looks like a sparrow dipped in rasp- berry juice'. He knew then that the bird was a purple finch. So with the garden, it is a metaphor, where an ideal of man-nature is represented. Man-nature relationships 'ought' to be everywhere as is represented in the ideal of the garden. Nature should be a garden. That then is the protestation, that is what is being said; one can next ask, how well, with what power, economy, skill is it represented ? GOD-MAN-NATURE Attitudes have changed towards God-Man- Nature in different societies, different places and times. I do not suggest that these changes are evolutionary but they are direc- tional. In the beginning all people apparently were animisi, animatisi or pantheist, believ- ing that God or Gods animated all things and creatures. Survival, success and well- being were contingent upon understanding the relative power of beasts, things, places, and acting in propitiatory ways. By so doing one avoided plague, pest, flood, drought, disease, war, violence and ensured success. This was a very important world view, darkened by superstition, yet within it was developed an extraordinary acuity to nature and even more important, the acts of man to nature were assumed to be sacramental. Violence to nature could invoke terrible retribution. Surely, even from the beginning, these nature deities assumed a hierarchy of im- portance. In more recent America salmon had primacy for the Indian of the North- western United States, buffalo for the Plains Indians, bear for the Iroquois, corn for the Pueblo and so on. This became formalized in Polytheism where gods become identified hierarchically and rôles and powers are attributed to them. So in Egypt, Mesopo- tamia, Sumeria, the tree of knowledge, Nile, desert and mountain, lion and lamb, among others, became deities. The next progression becomes visible in Ancient Egypt where men who were kings decided to also become Gods, so that men-gods invade the pantheon. They were omnipotent, omniscient and immortal and their tombs reveal the last proclamation. In Greece polytheism also appeared but the Gods in Greece were never resolutely hierarchical, and moreover, they often be- haved in unmistakably human ways - they committed murder and adultery, were cowards and sulked. They could be both human and divine. They were not neces- sarily omnipotent or omniscient. The emergence of monotheism resolved pluralism, duality, and replaced it with one God, Jehovah, omnipotent, omniscient, dis- placing all other Gods. Moreover the attitude to nature was resolved once and for all. 'Ye shall have no graven images', no idols. Rejection of the golden calf was a declaration of war against nature. Nature worship in- volved the rejection of Jehovah. The attitude was formalized. 'God made man in his own image, made he him.' No things, places, plants, microorganisms, no animals, save one, were made in the image of God. Thus the acts of man to man were moral and sacramental. The acts of man to nature were secular and not constrained by the moral code. More, the rôle of man to nature was specified. Man is given dominion over life and non-life. Finally his rôle is extended: 'ye shall multiply and subdue the earth'. Such is the Judaic conception of God-Man-Nature. Christianity absorbed it unchanged but added otherworldliness. Life on earth be- came a probation for the life hereafter. This diminished the importance of nature even further as did monasticism and the elevation of chastity. Christianity also assumed that 135</page><page sequence="5">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS FEBRUARY I980 the fall of Adam was induced by the serpent the tree, the apple and nature. Nature not only shared man's fall from grace but in- duced it. Nature was carnal, bestial, pagan, barbaric and an inducement to sensual sin and paganism. Those who sought to see nature as the work of God - Duns Scotus, Johannes Erigena, Francis of Assisi, and more recently, Gerard Manley Hopkins, were viewed as heretics and strongly con- strained or punished. Strangely this view, most succinctly stated in the first chapter of Genesis, is not only espoused by Jews and Christians, Catholics and Protestants, but by Capitalists and Communists, atheists and agnostics. It is the implicit western view of man and nature - dominion and subjugation. A paradox is represented by Islam. The same Semitic people from the same environ- ment created the three great religions - Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The first two are committed to dominion and subjuga- tion as man's rôle toward nature. In Islam the selected text comes from the same source. The creation story in the Koran is similar to the biblical story but the chosen text is quite different. Mohammed emphasized the inj unc- tion to Adam 'to dress the garden and keep it'. He also took the description of paradise in the creation story and this became em- ployed as the literal plan for godly man to create a paradise garden on earth. The water welled from the ground and parted into four ways - the four rivers of paradise. In this garden grew all beautiful flowers and goodly fruit. There were eight pearl pavilions await- ing the true believer in Paradise. There is no dominion or subjugation here; rather there is an injunction to create Paradise on earth. So the Paradise Garden is the metaphysical symbol of the Islamic view of God-man- nature. The Christian view is epitomized in the gardens of the Middle Ages. Appropriately given original form in monasteries, as at Saint- Gall, nature is sanctified by human geometry, made subject to Christian human order, constrained within the wall outside of which barbaric nature existed - an earth defiled, unsanctified. Thomas Aquinas for- malized the hierarchy as God, archangels, man, beasts and things. These last, plants and animals, things, goods and chattels, had no rights and no duties save to serve man and thus God. The garden epitomized this. The dominant church, the priesthood, man, the gardener, plants sanctified by the Church, separated from their pagan brothers, their 136 sanctity revealed by the ordered display, serving God and his earthly surrogate, man. The Renaissance was more secular than the Middle Ages and introduced a wider concern for the phenomenal world but the attitude to nature remains medieval and Christian. But the power to express the relationship is vastly enhanced. So the humanist popes and cardinals of Renaissance Italy at Frascati revealed the same message but disposed more power and art in so doing. Villa D'Este, Lante, Aldobrandini, Mon- dragone all successively enlarged the demon- stration of man's power over nature, man's dominion, his power to subdue nature. The power to demonstrate even more persuasively moved to France and through the instrument of André Le Nôtre, for Fouquet at Vaux-le-Vicomte and Louis XIV at Versailles the western Christian view was finally elaborated and presented. Louis XIV, king by divine right, viewed from his palace all nature reduced to an embroidery pattern, employing docile, tractable plants, geo- metrically arranged, giving evidence of their submission to his dominion and subjugation. Great art indeed, great skill that is to say, but bad science. If the question is 'What is being said ?' I would reply, 'Man, made in God's image, demonstrates his dominion over nature'. If the question is 'How well is this said ?' I would reply, 'Magnificently, a superb expression of a statement'. A skilful expression of a false statement. Now simultaneous with the completion of Versailles in 1701 there were perturbations here in London. A number of writers were proclaiming a revolutionary idea - that there might, and should be, a harmony of man and nature. Addison, Pope, Steele, Cowley, Dyer, Thompson and later Lord Shaftesbury spoke and wrote on this subject. Evelyn in Sylva had earlier recorded the deforestation of England and the difficulties of finding timbers for the English Navy. Also, the Germans had developed superior agricultural techniques of ploughing, crop rotation, and management using larger field sizes with an emphasis upon meat production with cattle and sheep. The culminating educational experience of young gentlemen included the Grand Tour, among which the Dolomites were viewed as a sublime experience. The painters Salvator Rosa, Poussin and Claude Lorrain had removed man and human drama from the centre of paintings and represented I nature large and man small, and finally, I Jesuit priests had discovered China and sent</page><page sequence="6">FEBRUARY I980 THE GARDEN AS A METAPHYSICAL SYMBOL news of this back to Europe. Among their most dramatic discoveries was a novel mode of composition. In paraphrase they said that 'while among us order is achieved by arraying similar things symmetrically bordering imaginary axes, the Chinese employ dis- parate things of unequal character and dis- pose them in ways which achieve an occult balance'. This was revolutionary indeed, and the whole convergence of novel ideas was ex- pressed in experiments - first Pope's garden at Chiswick, followed by Kent at Stowe. Of Kent it was said ťhe leapt the wall and dis- covered all nature to be a garden', and again (beyond the wall), 'he found a new creation'. There followed other axioms - 'nature is the gardener's best designer'. 'Nature abhors a straight line' (false but probably salutary as an antidote to Versailles). From this revolutionary view developed the greatest single accomplishment of art and knowledge in the entire history of the west - the transformation and amelioration of a national landscape. Through Kent, Brown, Repton, Knight, Price and Shenstone and their widespread imitators, the landowners of England, the country was transformed. But this great revolutionary idea, the advent of the modern world view, was reduced from romanticism (a denigrating title), to mere sentimentality by Payne Knight and U vedale Price and succumbed to tufa grottoes and hired hermits, and finally suffered humilia- tion through miniaturization and esoterica in the nineteenth century. There are im- portant exceptions. From Paxton and Birken- head Park eighteenth-century principles were applied to the creation of nineteenth- century urban parks throughout Britain, while in the United States, first through Alexander Jackson Downing and later Frederick Law Olmsted, the English eigh- teenth-century tradition blossomed into new forms - the National Park, the college campus, and, not least, the bucolic suburb. But even in the nineteenth century these views were aberrant. Industry and com- merce were the reigning theologies with their gods of profit and efficiency, the minor gods of avarice and gluttony. They reign to-day. Meanwhile animism, animitism and pan- theism have persisted, unresponsive to polytheism, monotheism, Judaism or Chris- tianity, humanism or technology, embraced by the largest portion of humanity. Among these one people was conspicous for its ability to transform a barren and violent land ! into one of the most productive and beautiful in the world. Committed to Tao, Shinto and Zen Buddhism, all pantheism, united in the view that nature was a manifestation of God, that enlightenment could best be found in nature, that the acts of man to nature were sacramental, were the Japanese. Inheritors of Buddhism from China, the Japanese de- veloped this view, notably in Zen. They produced a language with a notable acuity to the nuances of nature, a poetry at once powerful and succinct, a wood architecture of moving simplicity and power, and not least a garden art, for the garden was seen as the most powerful metaphysical symbol for Tao, Shinto and Zen. A NEW METAPHYSIC If the major questions confronting in- dividuals, families, institutions and societies remain the same - 'How does the world work?' 'How can I arrange my affairs to ensure survival, success and fulfilment?' - what answers can we give ? First the concep- tion of man having exclusive divinity, en- joined to exercise dominion, to multiply and subdue the earth, has no survival value, no correspondence to reality. Indeed it repre- sents self-mutilation, it can only lead to genocide and biocide. We are plant parasites, dependent upon the operation of natural processes. To dominate or subjugate is folly, it is an expression of a giant cultural inferiority complex, a bile of ancient ven- geance, a residue of a time when man, puny in the face of an all powerful nature, sought to control what he believed was capricious- ness in nature, revealed in flood, drought and pestilence; yet surely, the remedy is not subjugation but rather understanding and adaptation. How then does the world work ? How can we work for survival, success and fulfilment ? Science tells us how the world works. But scientists have divided it. Only ecologists are concerned with the operation of whole systems. How can we manage our affairs ? Science can advise us how to, but it has many voices. Only human ecologists are prepared to try to integrate physical, biological and social systems as opportunities and con- straints for human use. What then is the ecological metaphysic? In simple paraphrase it has three states, each of which can oscillate between extremes. Creativity or Syntropy - -&gt; Entropy Fitness Misfitness Health Pathology /Morbidity 137</page><page sequence="7">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS FEBRUARY I980 Syntropy and entropy are terms defined by physics. Entropy is central to the second law of thermodynamics which says that all energy is destined to degradation. By extension the cosmos will end in heat death with all matter randomly diffused at zero temperature. Syn- tropy, while not contradicting entropy, and not its opposite, states that while all energetic transactions result in an increase in entropy, certain energetic transactions may have a product of matter and energy at a higher level of order that preceded the energetic trans- action. As an example, it is thought that the primeval world consisted of hydrogen alone. The explosion of a supernova increased the entropy of the cosmos but there was a residuum of more highly ordered matter, not only hydrogen, but helium, lithium, beryl- lium, boron - all of the elements. So the evolution of matter was creative, Syntropie. So too with the evolution of life forms, all energetic transactions. Each one inci eased entropy. But, as evolution proceeded, succes- sive forms represented syntropy in their more highly organized energy and matter. So the biological evolution too was, and is, creative, Syntropie. Indeed we have a criterion for this. It is called fitness. This term has two complemen- tary meanings derived from two sources. The first is derived from Sir Charles Darwin, who declaimed that 'the surviving organism is fit for the environment'. Much later Lawrence Henderson, a biologist at Harvard, said Darwin is correct, but the opportunities for fitting offered by environments are as im- portant as the fitting of the organism to the environment. He supported his hypothesis with an elaborate examination of water, sea water, hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, carbolic acid (to which George Wald on his intro- duction to a recent edition, adds nitrogen and possibly sulphur). So these two propositions can be joined and represented as an imperative for evolu- tionary success. There is a requirement for every organism (man, institution, ecosystem) to find the fittest of all available environ- ments, adapt it and the self to make it more fitting. What then constitutes fitness ? Why, a fit environment is that which, as found, does the largest amount of work required of the environment by the consumer, the user. Evolutionary success requires the least work of adaptation. Is there a criterion for fitness? Most assuredly, and it is implicit in Darwin's formulation, ťthe surviving organism is fit Ï38 for the environment'. It revolves around the state of health as opposed to disease and morbidity. We must define health. The World Health Organization defines a healthy man or woman, and by extension institution, nation state or ecosystem, as one that seeks and solves problems. There is a second definition. Health contains the capacity to recover from insult or assault. Fitting and fitness are problem solving. Fitness results in health. Moreover, fitting has an energy corollary. Therefore fitness-health is Syn- tropie. More, the process of achieving fitness contributes to health. The antithesis con- firms the thesis. Pathology or morbidity reveals misfitness - the inability of a system to fit the environment, or to adapt that environ- ment or itself. It may also involve the in- ability to obtain and expend the necessary energy or time to accomplish fitting. Such a misfit will result in pathology. The inability to seek and solve problems reveals morbidity. The morbidity of cells extends to tissues, organs, organisms, and the ecosystem, and as Darwin said, the extinct organism was unfit for the environment. It is clear that this ecological formulation revolves around adaptation. While there are three mechanisms employed in adaptation, only one need concern us here. Physiological adaptation through mutation and natural selection is not amenable to voluntary control nor is the modification of innate behaviour. Only cultural adaptation is plastic and can be determined by thought and action. Cultural adaptation includes lan- guage, symbols, art, law, government, litera- ture, but which of these most directly addresses the Darwin/Henderson impera- tive ? Why, planning and design - the selec- tion of the fittest available environment. The adaptation of this and of the self. PLANNING AND DESIGN Let us now define planning and design. These can be defined as the formulation of alternative futures; the recognition that the achievement of these futures requires a sequence of actions and courses of action. These must next be reconstituted in terms of probability and as costs and benefits. Here, it is important to recognize that what is defined as either cost or benefit will vary from person to person, institution to insti- tution, nation state to nation states; even more, it may change for one person at different times. So values must be elicited, not attributed. Given these hypothetical</page><page sequence="8">FEBRUARY I980 THE GARDEN AS A METAPHYSICAL SYMBOL futures, constituted into actions, evaluated as to costs and benefits, the least cost/ maximum benefit solution will reveal the preferred plan of action. However, these actions and courses of action will occur in a physical world, a bio- logical world and a social world. In order to plan we must have as much predictive power as science can provide to predict the con- sequences of our hypothetical actions. In planning alternative futures the experi- ential alternatives can become important. It is not enough to conclude upon a strategy of adaptation, a city or building, park or garden. The decision will depend upon the quality of the experiences. Here lies the realm of skill-art; the creative ability to invent spaces, forms and experiences and to realize them. Here too the Darwinian/ Henderson imperative will also apply, for fitness relates to process and to form. There will be a most fit solution with intrinsic form. It appears that there is a new metaphysic, widely espoused by the scientific com- munity, there is agreement as to our under- standing of the way the world works. It contains neither anthropocentrism nor an- thropomorphism. There is no place for claims of exclusive divinity while dominion is merely self-mutilation and subjugation leads to suicide, genocide and biocide. The secular form of the western view holds that reality exists because man can perceive it, that the cosmos was created to support man on its pinnacle, that nature exists primarily for human delectation and use and that nature will tolerate infinite abuse, regenerate continuously and provide for our needs. These views are either infan- tilism or psychopathology. They have no correspondence to reality, no support from science Metaphysical views, religions, are, of course, adaptive strategies. They should constitute a working view, which, when adopted and applied, will guarantee survival, success, and fulfilment. Art too is an adaptive strategy - a particularly powerful medium for abstracting and representing assump- tions about the world, but it is subject to criticism of the statements being expressed. Technology may well be the most charac- teristic adaptive strategy of the western world. According to Lewis Mumford, who has spent a lifetime examining technology, it is an inevitable product of a metaphysic which seeks mastery over nature. Therein lies the motive which has generated western technology and the veneration it receives. In the modern scientific view the world is comprehensible through the operation of natural laws, time and history. It reveals an interacting biophysical and cultural system. Physical evolution preceded the evolution of life; with the onset of life co-evolution of physical and biological systems developed. With the advent of man co-evolution in- volved matter, life and man. We have the Big Bang Theory of cosmic evolution preferred by modern physics. While it is no more capable of explaining ultimate origins than are the conventional religions, it does present an enthralling explanation for the evolution of matter and the cosmos and the laws and processes that obtain. Physical systems involve great geo- chemical cycles engaging atmosphere, hydro- sphere and lithosphere, the cyclic nature of the last brilliantly illuminated by plate tectonic theory. The model of biological evolution is Darwin's great gift to mankind - a prodigiously inventive system called muta- tion combined with infinite time and an editing procedure called natural selection explains the phylogenetic history of life forms and their presence to-day. The eco- logical model gives us the syntropic-fitness health versus entropie misfitness-pathology states. It is clear that there are universal laws governing matter, the cosmos, galaxies, the solar system and the earth, there are universal laws governing life. Gravity, entropy, the conservation law, the matter and energy equation appear universally true. Biological evolution holds true for earth history. And any valid metaphysic must include such laws. If metaphysics are central adaptive strategies for man they should first be consistent with universal laws. However, the factors which are relevant to survival and success vary with environments. There is then an evolutionary imperative to understand processes of particular signi- ficance to particular environments - the examples of Arctic tundra and desert will suffice. Universal laws apply on both environ- ments, the critical factors vary and are generic to specific environments. Solutions to these problems posed to life become the most consequential knowledge essential for survival. There are then universal laws and a regional selection of knowledge and adaptive strategies most central to survival in each environment. Clearly an appropriate meta- 139</page><page sequence="9">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS FEBRUARY I980 physic will subscribe to universal laws but it should also be appropriate to different people, places and time. It should have laws which are particular to people, places, circumstances and time. The variability of environments results from unique historical events in geological, meteorological, hydrological, biological and cultural history. This produces generic regions, often described as physiographic regions of bioclimatic zones which contain a relative homogeneity expressed in climate, rocks, water, soils, plants, animals, resources and with characteristic opportunities and constraints to human use. Adaptive strategies for plants and animals are region-specific as for ocean, desert, tundra, rain forest. Should not human adaptive strategies be as region specific ? We have been victims of the quest for universal solutions. While science recognizes both universality and specificity, the major religions insist upon their universality and their exclusive possession of truth. Political doctrines - Capitalism, Democracy, Socia- lism, Communism are equally insistent upon their universality. These claims are certainly anti-ecological. In all of the quests for uni- versal laws the most obvious folly lies in architecture - the insistence of modern archi- tecture that there should be an International style. Clearly environments vary, archi- tecture is an adaptive strategy, it should be systematic in relation to environments but variable as between them. Thus there should be architectural similarities in desert archi- tecture, as there are for plants and animals, but there should be distinctions based not only upon biophysical factors but on culture. The environment determines the problems and thus the appropriate adaptive strategies, natural selection edits them. As environ- ments are variable so too will be the appro- priate strategies. Plants and animals have developed adaptive strategies appropriate to environments. These are generally described in terms of bioclimatic zones - arctic, tundra, taiga, boreal forest, temperate deciduous forests, prairies, desert savanna, and rain forest. In each of these the creatures which constitute these environments, and give them identity, reveal the problems and opportunities afforded by the environment in their processes, adaptive strategies and their morphology. Behaviour in animals also constitutes an adaptive strategy. In animal societies we find examples of autocracy (the social insects, 140 ants, bees, wasps, termites provide such an example), anarchy in the case of many solitary animals (notably the grizzly bear), tribal societies with chieftains, others with elders. We find animal examples of mono- gamy, bigamy, polygamy, polyandry and promiscuity. We find many examples of co- operation, more characteristic of life than competition, which also exists; these are animal examples of altruism (indeed accord- ing to Seelye there is evidence for inter- cellular altruism) . There are solitary creatures, social ones and gregarious examples. Should we not expect to find human analogues to these ? In animal species hierarchy and dominance are pervasive, but not in ecosystems. While they are trophic levels - top carnivore, herbivore, plants, microorganisms - none is dominant, each plays a contributory rôle and only the plants and decomposer organisms are indispensable. In those succession charac- terizes the system with successive rôles, none of which (even climax if it exists) is truly dominance. Perhaps this natural law has analogues for man. So an ecological metaphysic would begin with universal laws and contain solutions, emphases and values specific to place, work, folk. We would expect that resources, means of production, technology, institution, settle- ment pattern and values would be region specific. We would expect that these means of production, settlement patterns, institu- tions and artifacts would derive from place- folk-work specifically and be expressed both directly and symbolically. The gardens which have been examined are, by agreement, consummate expressions of the assumptions made by their respective societies with respect to God-man-nature, they reflect available technology and reveal extraordinary skill in expressing the prevail- ing values systems. However, they are almost all historical emblems reflecting assumptions about the world which certainly do not cor- respond with modern science. Nonetheless, if there is an autocratic society, the appro- priate mode of expression was well developed in Ancient Egypt, and Rome, in Renaissance Italy and France. It is no accident that both Hitler and Mussolini found the forms of ancient Rome to be sympathetic to their political views. If duality characterizes the polytheism of a society Greece provides formal exemplars. If the locus of a society is the desert and society assumes the rôle of making it bloom, Islam and the Muslim</page><page sequence="10">FEBRUARY I980 THE GARDEN AS A METAPHYSICAL SYMBOL Garden give a basis for expression. Should society occupy a humid temperate zone and be dedicated to demonstrating a harmony of man and nature, then the eighteenth century- English tradition provides a formidable vocabulary of successful experience. Should it believe that God is manifest in nature and the encounter with enlightenment can be enhanced in a compressed and heightened abstraction of nature, then the Zen gardens of Japan provide examples. But what do western peoples believe? What are our metaphysical symbols ? This is not a subject which has received much scholarly attention. Certainly mercantilism constitutes a central value, consumption is urged and applauded. The expression of mercantilism is pervasive and aggressive. It permeates the entire urban visual experience. We are a secular society ; the church was long overshadowed by the office building. Our temples are the Seagram Building, Lever House, the Prudential Building, Sears Tower and the like. We view nature as commodity and this is visibly expressed in industry, commerce, mining, agribusiness and forestry. The operations are the symbols. We venerate technology, so space rockets, supersonic planes, massive mechanical equipment, weaponry are again artifacts and symbols. Where is the garden in this review? Well, the quest to dominate nature which fuelled the Renaissance and begat technology has been achieved. Its success is omnipresent in technology. It is the basis for the implicit view that technology can solve any problem, that the exercise of mastery can be performed everywhere, in space, the planets, and over all the earth. It is unnecessary to demonstrate this in as small a scale as a garden when the earth is the appropriate canvas. Science is viewed as the necessary source of technology. Art is seen as an indulgence of the rich and peripheral to life. But there are other views. The aberrant traditions with origins in pantheism persist in the Lapps in Europe, in the Indians in North America. It had a historic western expression in Duns Scotus, Johannes Eri gena, Francis of Assisi, Gerard Manley Hopkins. It found secular allies in science, notably the early naturalists, and later in the eighteenth-century English landscape tradition, while in the United States David Thoreau, Emerson, Jonathan Perkins Marsh, Frederick Law Olmsted, and John Muir founded a powerful conservation movement for which Aldo Leopold developed a land ethic. While not a dominant force in western society it is nonetheless powerful. In the United States the national parks and forests, wilderness, scenic rivers, National Environ- mental Policy Act, Clean Air and Clean Streams Acts, the Mining Law of 1978 and, not least, the Native Claims Act for Alaska speak to its effectiveness. It too has a motto and a symbol. The motto, originating in the Stockholm Conference on the Human En- vironment, was 'Only one earth' and the symbol is the image of that solitary green orb, the earth, our home, taken from space. It is clear from the foregoing where my sympathies lie. I subscribe to the scientific view of the evolution of matter, life and man, the conception of evolution, the ecological view. I see ecology as a metaphysical view, which does correspond with reality, the acceptance of which by the world at large is indispensable for the continued survival of mankind. I also recognize that this is still a minority view and that it conflicts not only with Capitalism, Socialism and Communism but with Judaism, Christianity and the secular religions of consumption and tech- nology. Yet, were it to be widely espoused it would develop an appropriate symbolism. While it is essential that one earth form the basis, the regional variations would beget appropriate regional strategies reflected as now in their characteristic land forms, climates, plants and animals but equally in the works of man. The metaphysic, widely believed, would influence language and thought, institutions, education, government, law, industry, com- merce, medicine and art; skill would be employed to express it. There would be an ecological metaphysic and an ecological sym- bolic language. The rôle of the garden would surely change. Instead of selecting particular sites for highly abstracted expres- sions of the prevailing metaphysic, all of the works of man would subscribe to this eco- logical view and would be seen to express it. I have long employed an image conceived by the late, great American anthropologist, Loren Eiseley. Long before man had pene- trated space Eiseley described the event. His imaginary astronaut from out in space observed this tiny orb, the earth our home ; he saw it to be green, green from the mari- time algae in the oceans, the verdure on land. He saw the earth as a green celestial fruit. But on this green orb he saw blemishes, black, brown, grey, blotches from which extended dynamic morbid tentacles. He 141</page><page sequence="11">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS FEBRUARY I980 perceived that this morbid tissue was the work of man and asked, 'Is man but a planetary disease ?'. Perhaps so, and if so the malady is anthropocentrism and anthro- pomorphism. In my imagination I see that time when a new metaphysic replaces our ancient in- feriority complex, when the claims of primacy, exclusive divinity, dominion and subjugation are seen to be the remnants of an infantile cultural psychopathology long retrograde. The product of this world view, applied world-wide, would join nature's in- ordinate capacity for regeneration with man's intelligent co-operation, and a silent astro- naut would see the blemishes upon the world's living epidermis shrink, to be re- placed with vibrant healthy tissue. This is a metaphysical symbol devoutly tobe desired. Man in nature, true and seen to be true. DISCUSSION Mr. T. H. D. Turner (Landscape Architect): I should like to ask Professor McHarg what is his view of Plato's writings. There seems to be a complication, because he is perhaps the greatest of Greek philosophers and Professor McHarg praised Greek philosophy; but Plato is also the originator of the hierarchical theme both in Christian thought and in Western philosophy. The Lecturer: I began to go through the exercise with modern philosophers, asking them to reconcile classical philosophy with the realities of modern science. They are really irresolved - there is no resolution. So I decided that the thing to pursue is not classical philosophy, any more, but simply modern science. That is not an answer to your question ; and I may not be right, but that is where I am going. Mr. Maurice E. Pickering: Would Pro- fessor McHarg say whether he thinks the land- scape profession has any deficiencies which it needs to remedy in order to meet the challenge he put ? The Lecturer: I have strong feelings about this. I think landscape architects to-day should try to rediscover the eighteenth century. If a few landscape architects of that era could cause so many landowners in England to emulate them and transform the land, then they really had some very good ideas indeed. They were not 'ecologiste', their science was not very good at all, but their intuition was and they certainly used it very well. We have much better knowledge to-day, but we do not seem yet to have generated enough power to transmit this knowledge. So I would say that the most important thing land- scape architects have to do is to become better ecologiste; that is, we have got to ensure that they are versed in physical science, geology, mythology, meteorology, hydrology and the physical properties of soils. They have also got to learn social science, anthropology and topo- graphy. Obviously you have got to be selective about this, but these people should at least be familiar with the vocabulary in all these dis- ciplines. There are systematic ways in which it can be taught and taught effectively. There is no question in my mind that landscape architects 142 have got to be familiar with science to be able to use its predictive capability. Given that capability, there is no question that society will use them. We will then be able to do what the eighteenth century did but we will have more evidence and more persuasive power. Mr. Brian Smith: Professor McHarg, how much of your time do you spend in trying to change the world and how much do you spend trying to live with it as it is ? The Lecturer: I don't believe I am going to change the world; all I am trying to do is to justify my work to myself and justify myself to students who pay a lot of money to study. I love much in the world as it is. I find it an enchanting and miraculous place, improbable beyond any expectations. But we could make it better. There is suffering, misery and ugliness - and so much stupidity. We do things so badly. Almost all my professional career is concerned not with doing good, positive things but in trying to stop people doing stupid things. For example, not so long ago I was in Seattle where the US Atomic Energy Commission were going to put an atomic reactor in a seismically active area. Some- body asked me what should be done about it, and what did I think about the Governor of the State of Washington, who used to be the Head of the Atomic Energy Commission. I said that these are people who are always wrong - the topographers and members of the Atomic Energy Commission. For me Paradise would be if Society said to me, McHarg, we promise to use all the extra- ordinary intelligence which does repose in the world to do things which are not stupid. We will now address ourselves to the business of doing things well'. There is so much skill, talent, capability, knowledge, and it is not being used to good effect. That, I think, is the tragedy. I am happy with much of the world. I am a very lucky man, I love what I am doing, I like the people I associate with. All of these things are wonderful, but they could be made so much better. I and people like me could provide a much larger service to society. All of us wish that we had the opportunity to do so.</page><page sequence="12">FEBRUARY I980 THE GARDEN AS A METAPHYSICAL SYMBOL The Chairman: I know that we would all want to thank Professor McHarg for coming all this way and giving us so much to think about. He has shown us a really wide view of human and natural history from the Garden of Eden onwards, and he has given us a vision of what the future might be and the part that some of us might be able to play in making it work better than it works now. Sir Peter Masefield: I must make a small confession. I was puzzled when I first read the title that the Professor gave to his lecture: 'The Garden as a Metaphysical Symbol' - puzzled to know what it meant. I have listened carefully and in awe but I still remain puzzled ! But, of course, in the Journal of the Royal Society of Arts all will be made plain. Thank you, Professor McHarg, very much for coming. Only a most erudite Scotsman coming by way of England to Pennsylvania could have given us a lecture such as we have heard this evening. And thank you very much, Dame Sylvia, for presid- ing so delightfully. The meeting concluded with acclamation . ИЗ</page></plain_text>
