<plain_text><page sequence="1">The 1960's Was Braudel a Turning-Point? Steven Kaplan During thè 1960's- not thè long 1960's but thè decade defined by chronological markers- signs of Braudel-consciousness were not rife upon the American landscape, narrowly historiographical or more broadly intellectual. Between thè early, mixed reception of La Méditerranée at the beginning of the 1950's and its second coming in the early 1970's, Braudel commanded little scholarly press. The initial American évaluation is well known. A chaud, Melvin Knight in the Journal of Economie History critieized the Simiand monetarism that allegedly marred the work, but favorably assessed the overall contribution of this geohistory, without the remotest intimation of its future seismic impact in thè universe of historians (Knight, 1950: 212-16). Writing in that same journal less than a year later, Bernard Bailyn, at the dawn of a dazzling career as an American colonialist, harshly reproached this huge, rambling book for failure to achieve "thè integration of its parts that could resuit from the posing of proper historical questions." Aware of the wave of enthusiasm that enveloped La Méditerranée in France, he deplored the failure of Lucien Febvre and his countrymen to scrutinize it critically, and to distinguish between the accolades due the poet and the strictures that the scholar merited (Bailyn, 1951: 277-82). Braudel's pavé dans la mer found favor in the eyes of one of the leading American historians of early modem Europe, Garrett Mat- tingly, but not without nuance. "Colossal," "massive," "impressive," and "profoundly stimulating," the book was nevertheless uneven in conception and exécution. Somewhat vexed at Braudel's stigmatiza- tion of "traditional history," and his concomitant célébration of the "new [overwhelmingly French] history," Mattingly found the third (most frankly traditional but for him still perhaps the most impor- REVIEW, xxiv, 1, 2001, 185-210 185</page><page sequence="2">186 Steven Kaplan tant) section "disappointing" and "perfunetory." In addition, he con- fronted the Frenchman directly on his preferred terrain: the image is apt because Braudel "slighted" the "sea itself," in part by exagger- ating the prominence of the "watery Saharas" that putatively de- scribed and constrained major Stretches. Had Febvre's disciple pos- sessed a better understanding of ships and seafaring, he would have been obliged to "modif[y] a good many of [his] conclusions" (Matt- ingly, ΙθδΟΐδδθ-δΙ).1 In one of the rare echoes of Braudel's masterpiece in the Amer- ican 1960's, H. Stuart Hughes, a Harvard intellectual historian, re- hearsed his colleague Bailyn's negative appréciation. He perempto- rily dismissed the book as unworthy of the Bloch-Febvre projeet. "Sprawlingand invertebrate," lacking "discernible focus," it was hard to follow and it did not significantly inflect the study of the Euro- pean past (Hughes, 1968: 58). La Méditerranée did not enjoy its American revenge until the publication of the English-language version in 1972, marked by a sometimes scathing apotheosis in the Journal of Modern History and a dithyrambic world-encomium in the New York Times Book Review (May 18, 1975, 2-3).2 It seems clear that foreign imports did not begin to make an impact in the United States, even among the en- claves of cognoscenti, until the works appeared in translation. I do not believe that the attention given to the appearance of The Mediter- ranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip 7/bespoke the delayed influence of the subterranean Braudel of the 1960's, a vol- canic accumulation waiting to erupt. Before this publication, Brau- del-in-America existed in a purely chrysalidal state.3 1 One is tempted to think that the référence to "Lucien Lefebvre" in the review was not merely a coquille and/or a fusion of Febvre and the increasingly well-known Georges Lefeb- vre, but also testimony to the relative lack of pénétration of the "new history" juggernaut into American historiographical consciousness in the aftermath of the Second World War. 2 Journal of Modern History, (XLIV, 4, Dec. 1972), which included pantheonization by the editor, a testimony by Braudel himself, and articles by two distinguished historians, Hugh Trevor-Roper, who lauded the book, and Jack Hexter, who deftly combined expressions of generai admiration (not always without ironie seepage) and Substantive pi aise with mordant, even savage criticism (Andrews, 1975: 2-3).

Plumb's know-nothing onslaught on a mangled représentation of Annales-style historiography in generai and on Braudel in particular ("One thousand pages on the historical-geography of Italy still leaves Caesar, Augustus, Pompey, Nero and thè rest at thè center of the stage") in New York Review o/Books, Dec. 31, 1972. 3 Cf.

The fîrst painting of Civilisation matérielle received an enthusiastic albeit narrowly confined reception. The American Historical Review (AHR) hailed its daring scope and the rieh détail while remarking, somewhat curmudgeonously, that "in itself, of course, this picture is not new" (Rowen, 1968: 767). Far less nig- gardly, Traian Stoianovich, in the Journal of Modem History, invento- ried ail the fresh and freshly interpreted thèmes, and concluded that Civilisation matérielle "constitute[d] a resounding vindication of struc- turalism as a method of historical analysis," a reckoning that the vast majority of his readers would not then hâve understood (Stoiano- vich, 1966: 50-51). In thè broad survey he drafted periodically to keep American scholars abreast of récent developments in France, Pierre Renouvin evoked the Annales agenda featuring its focus on "long-range fluctuations, démographie trends [and] changes in ma- terial living conditions" without mentioning Braudel's name. Later in thè piece he cited "an important book that appeared in 1949" that he described, in implausible epitome, as "dealing with the Mediterra- nean world in the 16th Century" and atte'mpting "to promote a quan- titative history of modem economy [sic]." In fact, Ernest Labrousse loomed much larger in the article as the driving force of the new history emerging from France than did Braudel, an issue to which I shall return shortly (Renouvin, 1966: 1-12). Nor does Braudel figure in the authoritative treatments of the state of the profession written in the 1960's by such distinguished Americanists as Henry Steele Commager (who makes passing référ- ence to a motley brochette of Europeans including Burckhardt, Na- mier, Berlin, and Paul Hazard) and John Higham (who appended to his book an essay by Europeanist and Italianist Felix Gilbert who celebrated Bloch's totalizing yet humanistic historical approach and mentions Braudel once in passing) (Commager, 1966; Higham et al., 1965).4 For most initiated American historians, I believe that Braudel of Philip II" Times Literary Supplement, Apr. 7, 1966.

In evoking the civilizational model of historiography, which he lauds for resisting the fragmentation of discipline and of learning, Roy Nichols, President of the American Historical Association, cites Toyn- bee, Beard, and McNeill (Nichols, 1967: 414).</page><page sequence="4">188 Steven Kaplan loomed in vague, iconic terms, translatée! into the sort of respectful, self-regarding highbrow namedropping that characterized a review of Pierre Deyon's Amiens in 1968 in which the reviewer detected signs of Labrousse, Meuvret, Mousnier, Goubert, "and the imagina- tive scope of Fernand Braudel" (Forster, 1968: 625). During the 1960's, Braudel himself appears once in the pages of thè AHR, in French, probably at the suggestion of Frederic Lane, to review quite favorably a study of thè Venetian elite in which he notes with satis- faction- and not with contempt, let the Braudel reduetionists take note- that the "aspects sociaux et politiques de la crise sont étroite- ment mêlés" and which he hopes will lead to a full-scale "sociologie rétrospective" (Braudel, 1964: 147-49). While they had little occasion to encounter Braudel, in the 1960's, American historians heard increasingly more about the Annales. In Poland, England, and elsewhere, as Eric Hobsbawm re- marked, "Labrousse and Braudel and people like that were men- tioned in the same breath . . . there was not any very clear distinction between them" (1978: 157). Hobsbawm preferred talking about "the French nouvelle vague in history" rather than the narrower group in the orbit of the Vie Section or the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sci- ences Sociales (Hobsbawm, 1978: 157-58). Yet commentators did not always make the institutional, epistemological, and methodologi- cal connections that strike us today as obvious. In 1961, John Wolf wrote an effusive review of Pierre Goubert's Beauvais, but he did not place it in any historiographical context. Another reviewer took note of the Baulant-Meuvret édition of the Paris mercuriale, published in the SEVPEN séries under the aegis of Braudel's Centre de Rech- erches Historiques, but referred uniquely to Henri Hauser, the distinguished pre-Labrousse guru of price history. In his review of Pierre de St-Jacob's "exhaustive regional study" Les Paysans de la Bourgogne du Nord, Robert Forster, future Anglophone disseminator of Annales scholarship, noted its affinities with the works of Georges Lefebvre, especially Gaston Roupnel (a séminal influence on Brau- del, by the way), Henri Sée, Bloch, and "the Labrousse school." That same year, however, in his review of Forster's regional study of the Toulouse nobility, which he extolled for qualities redolent of the Annales manner, Paul Beik made no référence to French historiogra- phy. Reviewers placed Paul Bois in the Labrousse line, Duby in the tradition of Bloch, and Chaunu in the wake of Braudel, but the monograph by Daumard and Furet on Parisian social structure was</page><page sequence="5">THE 1960's 189 historiographically orphaned. Wondering whether Baehrel's icono- clastie conclusions about the seventeenth-century economy betrayed diversity of conditions or dubious historical method, Orest Ranum chided him for his excessive reliance on Simiand and Labrousse.5 Toward thè end of thè decade, in his elegiac évaluation of Le Roy Ladurie's Paysans de Languedoc, Forster adverted to "an entire school of French scholars" consti tu ted during thè past decade and includ- ing Goubert, Meuvret, Chaunu, Baehrel, Vilar, and St-Jacob devoted to "enlarg[ing] our understanding of French rural society in the old regime" (Forster, 1967: 596). Braudel had as much claim to figure on this list as Vilar and Chaunu, neither of whom had done much to advance the study of French rural history. It remains true that Braudel's absence is partly ascribable to the fact that he did not write French history, which was where most of the pioneering Annales action clustered. It is worth noting that ail Anglophones did not cele- brate the rise of the Annales, with or without Braudel. Even as Förs- ter lionized Le Roy Ladurie, Richard Cobb unleashed anonymously in the Times Literary Supplement a savage and derisive onslaught against the supercilious and narcissistic "Nous des Annales," target- ing less "the masters" than the "younger members of the Brother- hood," dubbed "frères-ès-conjoncture," taxed for their hermetic and fustian language, their infernal clubbiness and growing intellectual rigidity, and their "almost hysterical" allergy to criticism from out- side (Cobb, 1966). Were the 1960's a particularly congenial time for U.S. historians to embrace the Braudelian way and/or the Annales project? This is not the place to venture a cultural history of the profession during that tumultuous decade. Let us note cursorily a number of traits that help to define, in Braudelian terms, the limits of the possible. For historians, the onset of the 1960's marked the end of the postwar phase of homogenized culture and consensus that placed a premium on stability and minimized conflict in every arena. Fragmentation, disarray, and polarization followed hard in the wake of a stream of terrifying assassinations, heightened cold war tensions, an àccelerat- ing civil rights movement followed by ghetto riots, a burgeoning antinuclear campaign, embryonic feminist mobilization, and, above 5 American Hûtorical Review, LXVII, Oct. 1961, 116; LXVIJan. 1961, 516; LXVI, July 1961, 1103-04; LXVII, Oct. 1961, 119, 120; LXVII, Apr. 1962, 705-06; LXVIII, Oct. 1962, 119; LXVIII, Tan. 1963, 437; LXVIII, Apr. 1963, 710-12.</page><page sequence="6">190 Steven Kaplan all, the jolting impact of the Vietnam war which provoked and quick- ened Student revolt, the flowering of countercultures, and what Europeans came to cali a crisis of civilization. The unprecedented acrimony of life-in-society spilled over into the university, which carne under violent attack as a redoubt of bureacratization and oppression. Enrollments in history courses began to fall markedly as students questioned thè relevance of thè subject, and a job crisis gradually engulfed the profession.6 Différences in social origin and habits, in ideological engage- ment, in académie training, in génération, and in professional tra- jectory led historians to respond to thèse turbulences in diverse ways. While many sought solace in more or less traditional profes- sional values, others were radicalized or induced to recast their am- bitions and reassess their means. Engagement on the left, new or old (in its sundry hues) did not issue inexorably in relativist despair or nihilism. "Realist," objeetivist historiography still found favor in many quarters: left, center, and right. Historians groped for ways to find a voice consonant with their civic and human concerns on the one side and their epistemological inclinations and professional scruples on thè other. Toward thè beginning of thè decade, in his elegant presidential address at the American Historical Review, graced with Gallicisms {causerie, rencontre) and allusions to Marc Bloch's humanism, Cari Bridenbaugh gave expression Λο certain of the temptations and contradictions that would later buffet the profes- sion. On thè one hand, he seemed wistful for a simpler and more serene, seamless time when historians were solid all-Americans 6 On dispositions within the historical profession, see Novick (1988: 415-68) and Higham (1965: 235-36). Though I learned a lot from Giuliana Genelli's discussion of "Braudel et l'Amérique," I found it extremely hard to follow her analysis of the cultural transformations that rocked the American historical profession and impelled it to pay attention to Braudel. I did not expérience as a student or citizen the "crise de l'uni- versalisme libéral américain" as she describes it; I think she exaggerates considerably the signifkance of "le défi latin"; I am not convinced that the "généalogie de l'Europe pro- posée par Braudel" provoked a "malaise" among American intellectuals; and I do not fathom what she means when she writes: II est toutefois évident que dans la conjoncture du milieu des années 60, La, Méditerranée a occupé l'espace laissé vide par le dilemme de l'historiographie américaine, hésitant entre la fin du vieil idéalisme, content de lui et universel, et le nouveau désespoir d'un relativisme culturel privé du sens de l'unité et encore incapable de concilier l'unité présupposé de la civilisation-monde avec la multiplicité irréductible des cultures-monde (Gemelli, 1995: 230-37).</page><page sequence="7">THEl960'S 191 raised in small towns and nurtured on a shared Gemeinschaft culture. He worried that thè urban and/or cosmopolitan origins of thè présent génération- their "environmental deficiency"- would "make it impossible for them to communicate to and reconstruct the past for future générations." Many of the younger practitioners of the craft- Peter Novick tells us that thèse comments were "universally taken to be a référence to Jews"- Bridenbaugh regretted, are products of lower middle-class or foreign origins, and their émotions not infrequently get in the way of historical reconstructions. They find themselves in a very real sense outsiders on our past and feel themselves shut out. This is certainly not their fault, but it is true (Novick, 1988: 339). On the other hand, Bridenbaugh looked forward to a brave, new, more complex historical world-view that abjured what he scorned as "the retreat to politics, a flight back to the old-line politicai history" (Bridenbaugh, 1963: 322-23). He called instead for a focus on a more or less totalizing, sociocivilizational approach. He asked fhetorically if it is not probable that the future will be more interested in the character of our civilization, in industriai and scientific advance, and the nature of day-to-day life in Europe, Amer- ica, Asia or Africa, than in thè politicai minutiae of the first décades of the reign of George III, the grass roots of Jackson- ian Democracy in Pennsylvania, or whether it was merely his faith that defeated Al Smith in 1928 (1963: 326). This superficially neo-Annaliste discourse, however, did not herald a frère-ès-conjoncture in-the-making. For Bridenbaugh quickly launched into a shrill assault on "the dehumanizing methods of social sci- ences." Nor will the finest historians, he added, "worship at the shrine ofthat Bitch-goddess, QUANTIFICATION" (1963: 327-28). Bridenbaugh usefully reminds us that ideology and methodology are not locked into some sort of fixed relation.7 His speech also calls 7 1 remember how stunned I was in thè late 1960's when I learned that Jean Meuvret was deeply anchored on the right.

Many historians reacted to the traumas of the 1960's by turning to new genres of investigation and analysis. Many of those strains- inter alia, family and démographie history, history from be- low, labor history, dass formation, economie growth and its social conséquences, urban history, and adoration at various shrines of the Bitch-goddess- can be regrouped under the labile omnibus-rubric called "social history. " The Méditerranée of émergent American/ Americanist social history, which appeared barely two years after Bridenbaugh's speech, was certainly E. P. Thompson's TheMakingof the English Working Class, despite its quite traditional methods. Its allure, and its mobilizing capacity beyond its own epistemological boundaries, resided partly in Thompson's rejeetion of economism and his integration of culture as a social variable as well as in his ambition to cover the "total expérience" of working class life and to assay that expérience from the perspective of the working class who lived it. Braudel, too, toiled to rearticulate thè link between economy and lived expérience, but the English scholar would hâve appealed to Americanists far more than Braudel, even if the French historian had been as widely known, because Thompson attenuated the sig- nificance of structures of constraint and domination in order to give agency purchase. Still, Thompson and the Annales hive, along with Georges Lefebvre's group, helped Americans to rescue social history from the archaic status of a residual hodge-podge enterprise devoted to manners and mores, voluntary associations, "social" events and faits divers. If définition continued to remain elusive, scholars who did social history fervently knew in their hearts who they were, even if others could not always identify them as such in reading their work. By 1968, in a review of George Rudé's The Crowd in History in which Thompson and Albert Soboul were cited, Chuck Tilly cheer- fully announced that "thèse are good years for European social history" (Tilly, 1968: 296).8 workers, and attached to a bucolic France that readily accommodated traditionalist values. Passing from thè individuai to the collective stereotype, I also imagined in my early-apprenticeship days that the Vie Section contained ali the left-laic republicans while the Quatrième luxùriated in Catholic conservatives. 8 Americanist social history probably took a bit longer to reach this level of feit well-</page><page sequence="9">THE 1960'S 193 In a récent essay Jacques Revel asks a question that preoccupied me in the 1960 's when I was groping for authorization to board Braudel's historiographical vessel: "Fernand Braudel a-t-il été un historien du social?" (Revel, 1999: 18-19). (From my vantage point today, the question seems vulgarly corporatist and vacuously nomi- nalist. Yet it had mattered deeply back then when I was anxiously seeking both tools for navigation and a destination.) At the collo- quium of St.-Cloud in 1965- the Poissy of social history- Labrousse characterized the French historical school, a house with many mansions, for Soboul and Mousnier attended as well as Vilar and Goubert, as "la plus profondément sociale de toutes les écoles his- toriques du monde." Grounding social history in a genealogy that comprised Vidal de la Blache, Fustel, Pirenne, Sée, Hauser, Lefeb- vre, Febvre, and Bloch, but not his contemporary Braudel, Lab- rousse defined it as the study of social groups and their relations cast upon a three-tiered template redolent of the Annales sesame, but devoid of an articulated conceptualization of time and space, Brau- del's bread and butter (Labrousse, 1967: 2, 4-5).9 Clearly Labrousse was eager to accelerate the affirmation and institutionalization of this irredentist subdiscipline for, only a few years before, his devoted student Goubert, in thè preface to his thesis, had characterized social history tremulously as "bien plus un projet et une manière de voir qu'une science solidement constitu- tée." Positioning himself between miserabilist and populist pôles, Goubert construed his social history as basically history from below, a proto-Thompsonian moral and viscéral "besoin de m'intéresser à tous les hommes, et non seulement à ceux qui brillèrent par leur naissance, par leur état, par leur fonction, par leur richesse ou par being. In 1964 the Journal of American History, the officiai organ of the association of Americanist specialists, did not bother to review Stephen Thernstrom's Poverty and Progress: Social Mobility in a Nineteenth-Century American City (Cambridge, Mass., 1964) an analysis of the social mobility of the working population of a small Massachusetts town that is now regarded as a pioneering classic in social history, on the grounds that, prop- erly speaking, it belonged to the discipline of sociology (Weil, 1995: 203). 9 Labrousse also adumbrates a tension that Braudel might not find uncongenial between "movement" assodated primarily with the economy and "résistance" connected with social and especially mental structures (Labrousse, 1967: 5). On the pensée unique that characterizes the 1960's in French historiography, note Pierre Renouvin's apparently innocent observation: "In the opinion of almost ail young French historians, economie history can attain its füll significance only if it resulto in social history" (Renouvin, 1966: 11-12, emphasis added).</page><page sequence="10">194 Steven Kaplan leur intelligence" (Goubert, 1960: vii). Yet to justify this Lazarino- Micheletian project and to resurrect the essential people- to legiti- mize thè social history undertaking- the man from the Sarthe turned curiously, perhaps ritually to La Méditerranée, incorporating, with attribution, Braudel's evocative (yet not necessarily fitting) words in his profession of humility: "Je ne suis même pas certain d'avoir donné aux 'chenilles,' aux 'hannetons,' aux 'insectes humains' toute l'attention qu'ils méritaient, toute la place à laquelle ils avaient droit" (Goubert, 1960: vii). While Goubert solicited Braudel's caution for this embryonic social history in 1960 without addressing the perti- nence of his methods, a génération later, Michel Vovelle, another Labroussian, suggested that thè Braudelian tripartite temporal schema, whose applicability to domains other than economie history had remained an unresolved question for Braudel himself, turned out, in fact, to be too rigid for social historians (Vovelle, 1978: 330- 31). On one level it appears absurd to discuss Braudel's relation to social history, for he shared in some sensé the Annaliste conceit that ail history was perforce social. Yet he seems to hâve nurtured an ambivalence toward social history, whose définition remained elusive or protean, and whose tantalizing fascination and stubborn hege- mony he appears not to hâve anticipated. Although quite bulimie in its appetite, the Labroussian définition of social history was still too confined for Braudel. Social history involved virtually ail the dimen- sions of human reality and had to be cast in terms of an histoire globale. Braudel praised Labrousse's efforts, launched in Rome in 1955, to uncover the conjonctures sociales, even social structures: it was necessary for the social "actor" to join thè economie, though Braudel wondered about the temporal congruence of the two and about the direction in which the social actor would be inclined to move. Yet in his own publications, he gently accused Labrousse of a sort of lèse- science sociale, as the pursuit of the tout social seemed to lead him into régression towards politicai time. Pessimistic about social history's itinerary despite Labrousse's exubérance, Lefebvre's brilliant studies on the social structure of Orléans (1958) and the vigorous debate on social structure that pitted Mousnier against Porshnev, Braudel char- acterized its state as "médiocre" at the end of the 1950's. Announc- ing the grand collective study of material life in the Annales in 1961, he noted that despite the progress made "sous l'impérieuse et mag- nifique direction d'E. Labrousse,"- BAFFE- there was still a long way</page><page sequence="11">THE 1960'S 195 to go: "Car disons-le à haute voix: il n'y a pas encore d'histoire so- ciale digne de ce beau nom" (Braudel, 1958a: 49; Braudel, 1958b: 107; Braudel, 1961: 12-13). Was all this too exclusively Sorbonnard for Braudel's taste? "Serait-il dès lors un marginal parmi les historiens de l'après- guerre," asked Jean Boutier, who hinted that his distancing more plausibly translated a strategie "coquetterie" to situate himself above the debates that he did not himself instigate and whose terms he therefore did not define (Boutier, 1988: 92-94, 98, 100).10 Still, the Annales remained fully under Braudel's aegis and it published a steady stream of hardeore social his tory, and it is difficult, despite its sometimes Olympian perspective, not to view Civilisation matérielle, published in 1967, as an effort to penser and sketch out a long-run social his tory of the world.11 * * * How did I encounter- "receive" might be the more fashionable tenu- Fernand Braudel during my Student years in the 1960's?12 At 10 Cf. Stoianovich (1978: 19, 21). Eric Hobsbawm suggested that Braudel construed social history, in the words of Fustel de Coulanges, as "the science of human societies" (Hobsbawm, 1971: 24). In a piece published in 1967, Robert Mandrou took note of the vertiginous rise of social history, and sought to inflect its trajectory by critieizing its narrow focus on prices and wages to the neglect of other realities at least as important, "la production et la consommation, l'emploi des hommes" (Mandrou, 1967: 57-66). I found articles such as this heartening when I read them while in graduate school, for they reassured me that the Annales throng did not constitute a "sect" in the eighteenth Century sensé of the term, and that neither Braudel nor Labrousse was a Dr. Quesnay. 11 1 concur with Boutier: Je ne crois pas trop me hasarder en affirmant que, dans Civilisation matérielle, la longue durée se fait sociale: c'est en effet le "social" qui se voit attribuer d'im- pressionnantes capacités de freiner les évolutions, d'absorber les révolutions, "cette société patiente à qui sa lenteur donne une prodigieuse force de résistance et d'absorption. L'inertie c'est ce qui lui manque le moins" (1988: 108). 12 Transposing the discussion to the domain of égo-histoire in the sacred name of case study comports serious risks that make me tremble and for which I hold Maurice Aymard fully responsible. Beyond my doubts about the intrinsic interest of the enterprise and my uneasiness in becoming an active protagonist in the narrative, I ulcerate over method- ological issues to some considérable extent beyond my control. For I am dépendent on a flawed memory without much opportunity for external corroboration or control. Beyond its native mechanical defects, the memory can also play tricks generated by the less lofty reaches of one's unconscious. Plainly put, I worry about the tendency we ail hâve to reinvent outselves, to offer up, willfully or not, refractions and inflections and interprétations that estrange us from recovering the lived expérience that is our target.</page><page sequence="12">196 Steven Kaplan Princeton in thè early 1960's, I don't recali ever having heard his name mentioned. Certainly R. R. Palmer never referred to him in his course on thè eighteenth-century révolutions, though he might hâve found an affinity not with his conception of history but with his com- parative method. (And Braudel might have admired Palmer's em- phatically politicai Age ofthe Démocratie Revolution in light of his con- viction "qu'il n'y pas d'histoire scientifique possible si l'on n'emploie pas la méthode comparative" [ChâteauvaUon, 1986: 70]). Nor did Joseph Strayer or E. H. Harbison evoke Braudel in their medieval and renaissance courses. Given thè economie history filière that linked Braudel with Lane and other Americane, one might have imagined that Jérôme Blum, whose specialty was Russia but who worked comparatively across much of Europe, would have intro- duced us to Braudel, but my lecture notes do not support this hypothesis. When Blum wrote to Braudel three years after my de- parture from Princeton proposing an exchange accord with the Vie Section (the future EHESS), I am persuaded that the driving force was Lawrence Stone, who had just arrived and had ail sorts of French connections (Gemelli, 1995: 241). As a Fulbright student at the Université de Poitiers during 1963-64, I heard no écho of Braudel from Jean Egret, the moderniste specializing in politicai and institutional history. But Jacques Roger, who taught literature while practicing the history of science and collaborated in Furet's Livre et société project, did point me to the Annales as a place where I could learn about what was happening in history. I began reading through the early Annales issue by issue- a task I would later finish at Yale- in thè old law library facing the teeming marketplace and the earthily magnificent romanesque church of Notre-Dame la Grande. Having done my senior diesis at Princeton in American history, I entered Yale for the express purpose of studying southern history with C. Vann Woodward, one of the great American historians of this Century. Yet my two protracted sojourns in France- the first was probably more decisive in my life's trajectory: a job in a wine factory in the Parisian red belt, a red diaper baby's penance for having gone I may be indined to flatter myself by making me more cunning or percipient or less naive or gullible than I in fact was.

Toutefois, jouons le jeu!</page><page sequence="13">THE 1960's 197 to Princeton, which did not recognize the existence of the working class- impelled me to remain in touch with the European side. Robert Lopez was the person who urged me to read La Méditerranée, and we occasionally talked about such Braudelian thèmes as climate, trade, and transportation (Lopez, 1971; Green, 1993: 72). I checked the book out in my shelf in the History study room in Sterling library. One day I walked in to find a short, balding man in a scruffy suede jacket sitting in my spot reading my Braudel. When I asked him for it, he invited me somewhat crudely to shove off. uWho the hell are you?" I demanded. "Jack Hexter," he replied, curtly. I never took his course, partly for fear that he would punish me for my lack of déférence, but we chatted quite often about the Annales and about French history, though he was then transfixed by Claude Seyssel, a sixteenth-century politicai theorist, and certainly not by la longue durée or the price of bullion. I pressed him repeatedly to invite an Annaliste to give a lecture. That was not to be the case until I returned to Yale after having switched fields and spent two years in France; I raised money to invite from Princeton a man who had become one of my mentors, Pierre Goubert. But Hexter agreed to sponsor a visit from George Homans, a sociologist-historian whose work Bloch had reviewed favorably and who was willing to discuss with us the rendezvous between history and sociology, and the implications of structuralism for both. Certainly my reading of Braudel, but also of the Annales, the earlier volumes as well as the more récent, Bloch, Lefebvre, La- brousse, Meuvret, Goubert, and Le Roy Ladurie, among others, led me to abandon U.S. history. For lack of a mentor at Yale in the fields that interested me- early modem European social and eighteenth Century French- those readings loomed as even more significant, and my memory of them less blurred than it might otherwise hâve been. As I moved from American to French history, I had several generai préoccupations. One of the lessons of my apprenticeship in the Annales seemed to be that the best way to prepare to be an innovative and analytically powerful historian was to do as little work in history and as much in the so-called sciences auxiliaires as possible. I was excited by Braudel's insistence upon the need for interdisci- plinary practice. Or as he put it much later, to forge "une histoire gonflée par toutes les sciences de l'homme" or to "vivre en concubi- nage avec toutes les sciences de l'homme" (surely a parlous scenario in thè state of Connecticut, which still prosecuted people for using</page><page sequence="14">198 Steven Kaplan condoms in those days). In Braudel's vision, however, history was not decentered and devoured by the anabolized sister disciplines. Portraying history as queenly federator, Braudel rescued me from the gnawing inferiority complex that I had acquired vis-à-vis the social sciences, sens américain. Though the idea risked passing in individualistic New England as a Soviet paradigm, I was also taken with Braudel's assertion "qu'il n'y a pas de salut hors des méthodes du travail par équipe" (Châteauvallon, 1986: 162; Braudel, 1950: 25).13 A second concern, intimately linked to the first, was my urgent thirst for theory. I did not quite know what theory was, but I knew that I didn't hâve it, that my friends in sociology and politicai science did, and that most adult historians, at least in America, were allergie to it. Much of what Bloch and Febvre wrote about seemed to be tantamount to theoretical reflections, as they moved vertiginously from psychoanalysis to human geography, from économies to anthropology. The very notion of "histoire-problème" seemed then like a theoretical lever, even if in retrospect it appears more like a primitive surrogate, and it opened whole new vistas to me.14 In thinking about Braudel's celebrated "long-run" piece, I was per- suaded that this was theoretical engagement. He was coy in writing about theory: on thè one hand, he remarked that every historian used theory whether he knew it or not, in the manner of Molière's Monsieur Jourdain, while on thè other, he shied away from théories because they were often constrictive or stifling or merely erroneous. (His desire to keep his distance from Marxism, so notoriously asso- ciated with grand theory, probably reinforced this studied réticence, as did thè liberating horror of any esprit de système that marked the Annales from thè outset). In his preface to Civilisation matérielle, first édition, Braudel casually cites Sombart's "pas de théorie, pas d'his- toire," and owns up to a "schéma d'ensemble," his tripartite quasi- model, that surely constitutes a theoretical undertaking (1967: 9). In the much revised second édition, which is chronologically outside the bounds of my reading during the 1960's, he takes pains to 13 Cf. Hexter's remark on the persuasion of most American historians that "interdis- ciplinary studies in the social sciences are unprofitable" (Hexter, 1972: 491). 14 Cf. my colleague Michael Kammen's (Molieresque) contention that Americanist historians hâve been practicing histoire-problème, apparently sans le savoir, for as long as the Annales hâve existed (Kämmen, 1998: 1-25).</page><page sequence="15">THE 1960'S 199 explains that he "set out to write outside the world of theory, of ail théories" (1981: 23). I would hâve regarded this demurrer as dis- ingenuous, for it was dear to me that he had found a way to blend a highly refined perspective, kneaded by the long run, by the "dialectic of past/present," and spatial comparison, with a profound respect for and enchantment with "ail the richness, complexity and heter- ogenity of real life," along with a conviction that détails mattered in the élaboration and compréhension ofthat reality (1981: 25).15 If the Annales way operated furtively in the interstices of the Yale history department, Bridenbaugh's "Bitch goddess of QUANTIFICA- TION" strutted her stuff quite openly. Institutionally, the depart- ment was oblivious to new trends. No one taught anything that had a social science scent. As we returned from conférences where the quantifiers brandished recondite formulas to undermine age-old venues or to lay out striking new hypothèses, many of us felt that our so-called training was already anachronistic. How could our mentors be at once so indifferent and so complacent? Here was another reason to gravitate toward the French nouvelle vague. Brau- del was keenly interested in statistics, even if he did not use them with great sophistication, and the whole Labroussian school col- lected and counted, from the cave to the grenier, even if Chuck Tilly already made me aware that their parsimoniously descriptive ap- proach deprived them of rieh opportunities for far deeper statistical, associational, and causal analysis. It is only jolting in retrospect to hear Furet intoning the new mantras: "il n'y a d'histoire que sociale," and "il n'y a d'histoire sociale que quantitative."16 La Méditerranée riveted me because it was so profoundly dépay- sant I relished the vast distances, the changes in speed and in rhythms, the encounter between the exotic and the commonplace, the play between continuity and change (for I never had the impres- sion, despite the merciless sway of the long run and the privilège conveyed to stability, that Braudel disdained discontinuity).17 What intrigued me most were the questions that Braudel thrust into even 15 Cf. more recently Braudel's préférence for Tobservation de la vie économique réelle" to economie theory (Châteauvallon, 1986: 93). 16 These are phrases uttered to me by Furet in 1967 and etched in my mind. They may indeed appear in some text or other. For a generai view of quantitative and sériai history in France, see Furet (1982: 53-72). 17 Cf. the exchange between Braudel and Revel concerning the Annales's putative lack of a theory of social change (Braudel, 1978a: 257).</page><page sequence="16">200 Steven Kaplan sharper relief in Civilisation matérielle: Systems of exchange, organiza- tion of markets, problems of supply, terms of trade, and the banali- ties of every day life. La Méditerranée demoralized even as it exalted me.18 The scope was extravagantly beyond my reach. Fd never have the languages. Comparison seemed years and years away at best, for I understood that I needed first to come to know intimately France, past and présent, and that that in itself would be an arduous chore. I could not abide R. R. Palmer's view, an internalized expression of an equivocai sort of colonial domination, that it was fruitless to attempt to practice French history as French historians did it, for the playing field could never be equal given our distance from the ar- chives, libraries, and from the culture. Instead he urged that we locate our comparative advantage in more synthetic works, convert- ing our estrangement into a virtue and taking advantage of the myriad untapped veins of signification that lay fallow in the gargan- tuan French thèses whose authors rarely fully mastered the material they had gathered. I bristled every time I read a review of an Amer- ican monograph in a French publication that grudgingly allowed that the work was not so bad "pour un anglosaxon." So I knew that I could not board Braudel's vessel across space, and I also feared that it would take me many years to acquire a sufficient mastery to risk a long-run study that could be certain of escaping the stricture of superficiality. Of the Mediterranean trinity of Time, Space, and Man, ordy the latter seemed to be in my reach, and even Man was not easy to seize.19 Still, I succumbed to the blandishments of histoire totale, a. notion that I suspect I derived more from thè cumulative Annales than directly from Braudel, though I associated it paradigmatically with La Méditerranée. Warmly supportive of my Gallican turn, the courtly and avuncular C. Vann Woodward nevertheless looked at me as if I were mad when I announced that I wanted to do total history in- stead of southern history. Following Febvre, Marcel Mauss, and Braudel, I wanted to do "l'histoire totale de l'homme," to attend to "la totalité du social," but in a temporal and spatial context that I 18 The most soaring and frightening formulation of Braudelian scope is probably to be found in Châteauvallon (1986: 202-03): "II n'y a pas d'histoire de France, il y a une histoire d'Europe," and then "il n'y a pas d'histoire d'Europe, mais une histoire du monde." 19 On the "trinity," see Kinser (1981: 63-105).</page><page sequence="17">THE 1960's 201 could manage (Braudel, 1958b: 114; Braudel, 1963: 138; Braudel, 1950: 34).20 Diffusely conceived in my mind, total meant on the one hand that it was legitimate to explore every aspect of human exis- tence, from menarche to monarchy (as Peter Stearns once re- marked), from weather and disease to sex and food, from émotions to techniques, from crime to punishment, from the bottom to the top, a sort of Voltairian agenda to move beyond official/conven- tional history in search of "the meatiness of life."21 On the other hand, total signified an all-azimuth attack on a single central prob- lem- a sort of phénomène social total- that spoke to the fundamental concerns of an entire society in order to map out the ways in which it played out in all sphères: economie and social, to be sure, but also ciütural, religious, psychological, and politicai. The incongruity between Braudel's planetary gaze and my re- sources compelled me from the beginning to engage in a permanent jeu d'échelles in an attempt to find an objeet that was intellectually and psychologically plausible. This anxiety about scale, feasibility, tools, etc. probably led me to shift imperceptibly in my pragmatic orientation from Braudel to Labrousse, though I never relinquished my préférence for La Méditerranée and Civilisation matérielle over VEsquisse and La Crise. As if to reassure mere mortals, Braudel later explained that "globalité," as he preferred to say, was not wild hubris, but "simplement le désir, quand on a abordé un problème, d'en dépasser systématiquement." Still, during the 1960's, I thrilled to Goubert's modest acknowledgement of his tyro's enthusiasm for "le témoignage du XVIIe 'total' " and to Le Roy Ladurie's less chaste "aventure d'une histoire totale" which apparently called forth a geyser of sardonie remarks in the Parisian microcosme (Goubert, 1960: viii; Boutier &amp; Julia, 1995: 21). Total history intoxicated me, but intellectually I feasted on LSD, the 1960's' plat de non-résistance. This was the shorthand I used to define my Framework to my jerry-built thesis committee in early 1967: Longue durée, Structures, Daily life. Braudel's articulation of time marked me indelibly. Although I never became a véritable long- runner, the concept shaped ail of my research and for the past 29 years I hâve consecrated the first lecture of my Old Regime course- 20 Cf. Braudel's subséquent refinements, (1978b: 245). 21 On the long tradition of an iconoclastie total history, see Gay (1985: 205-12).</page><page sequence="18">202 Steven Kaplan the one meant to galvanize the students- to a Braudelian foray into time. If I had never reduced history to merely one damned thing after another, before Braudel, I had simply not thought about time. The idea that time was multiple, multi-layered, overlapping, tex- tured, simultaneously continuous and discontinuous, remote and nearby, aloof and intimate, misanthropie and hospitable, hot and cold, orderly and chaotic, determined and contingent, dense and diffuse, prolix and pithy- this was all révélation to me. I could sud- denly see things that had theretofore eluded me. I had instruments of relativization that did not necessarily preclude attempts at objectification. If the plurality of time and the dialectic among the différent velocities and rhythms intrigued me, I made of the long- run my personal golem, guide and ghost, "ce personnage encom- brant, compliqué" in Braudel's anthropomorphic and theatrical language (Braudel, 1958a: 41, 54).22 If I did not explicitly practice the long-run in my research, I was certainly a frère-ès-structure. Yale was then awash in structuralism- literary, linguistic, anthropological. I remained convinced that the diachronic was our fonds de commerce, but I did not view the syn- chronie necessarily as an assault upon historicity. I followed keenly Braudel's debate with Lévi-Strauss on one side and Sartre on the other, and was not wholly surprised to see the second édition of La Méditerranée "doped" with structuralism.23 From the first to the second édition, there seemed to be a double, convergent glissando: from geohistory to structure, and from long-run to structure. In- creasingly indistinguishable, long-run and structure stood in a reciprocally synecdochal relationship. Structures were botti quasi- everlasting and manifestly impermanent, very constrictive and less so, prisons to be sure, but not always high-security prisons from which escape was virtually impossible. Braudel offered a définition of structure that promised considérable analytical lattitude: assem- blage, architecture, highly résistant realities that perdure. I did not quite know what to make of his 1958 attack on "un humanisme rétrograde, insidieux" that introduced the discussion of the long-run and its structural vocation (Braudel 1958a: 41, 50-51). In 1965 22 Of course Braudel's enthusiasm for the long-run never blunted his skepticism for the trop longue durée. 33 Kinser counts 49 usages of the term "structure/structural" in the second édition as opposed to 11 in the first (1981: 88n).</page><page sequence="19">THE 1960'S 203 Braudel seemed to point to a new, more capacious humanism, however ambiguous, or at least to a frontier between his and other disciplines: Mais le "structuralisme" d'un historien n'a rien à voir avec la problématique qui tourmente, sous le même nom, les autres sciences de l'homme. Il ne le dirige pas vers l'abstraction mathématique des rapports qui s'expriment en fonctions. Mais vers les sources mêmes de la vie, dans ce qu'elle a de plus concret, de plus quotidien, de plus indestructible, de plus anonymement humain (Braudel, 1982: Π, 520).24 Far from a precocious apologist for "agency," not yet a fighting word in the 1960's, I was nevertheless troubled, philosophically and pragmatically, by Braudel's gloomy rendering of man "enfermé dans un destin qu'il fabrique à peine." Two years later in Civilisation ma- térielle, Braudel betrayed a certain ambivalence that suggested a small margin of maneuver (which I would later conceptualize as the Pascalian "chords of necessity and imagination" that could variously be tightened dramatically or loosened significantly over time). First the good news: "Une vie élémentaire qui cependant n'est pas entière- ment subie" (1967: 10). Then the bad news: "cette vie, plus subie qu'agie" (1967: 15).25 Braudel's uncompromising contempi for the event and his cavalier attitude towards politics that, under the nas- cent influence of Foucault, we were beginning to think of in terms of power, aggravated my malaise.26 Structure seriously delimited man's freedom, ofthat I was sure. But did that authorize or require histori- ans to bypass the struggle in which they engaged against those con- straints? Braudel inveighed against social-science abstraction, but if he refused to view daily life day by day, if he did not accept the social vécu as a valid terrain of observation, then didn't thèse endless repe- 24 Cf. Braudel's later reflections on the "structurant" and "commandant" tasks of the long-run (Châteauvallon, 1986: 70-71). One wonders what Braudel would hâve thought of the récent, student-led revolt against an allegedly dehumanizing, mathematically-based science of économies, estranged from the realities of the world in which they lived. See, for example, Le Monde, Sept. 13, 2000. 25 Cf. Braudel's contempt for Treitschke's "les hommes font l'histoire." "Non," he riposted, "l'histoire fait aussi les hommes et façonne leur destin" (1950: 21). 26 See the cursory remarks of an American reviewer of La Méditerranée who took note of the "analysis of the éléments of power" on the Spanish and Ottoman sides (Newhall, 1950: 365).</page><page sequence="20">204 Steven Kaplan titions, reduced by moving averages to tiresome sameness, merely congeal into a more or less mechanical abstraction? Nor did Braudel reassure me in his inaugural lecture at thè Collège de France when he affirmed his humane concern for "chaque homme aux prises avec sa propre vie." The issue for me was methodology rather than moral- ity, and it concerned the collectivity rather than thè individuai. Why were historians to be dissuaded from contemplating the "mouve- ments profonds de la vie des hommes" in the short term when so much was at stake? (Braudel, 1950: 35).27 Braudel's stigmatization of event-history did not shock me, but it seemed gratuitously, even perilously overdrawn. The short run was indeed capricious and deceptive, but the event was not necessarily a trivial, vacant, surface agitation. If, under pressure from Sartre, Braudel conceded that the event could annex to itself layers of greater significance, it was still the time of the Journalist, of "les médiocres accidents de la vie ordinaire" among which he included grain prices, crimes, and theatrical performances. In 1958 he de- plored "le retour au temps court," a backward step to a "temps moins encombrant" to which even his friend Labrousse "cédait." Thanks to him, "nous revoici dans le temps court, et jusqu'au cou" where, partly for dramatic effect, he connected "un pathétisme éco- nomique de courte durée (nouveau style), à un pathétisme politique (très vieux style)" (Braudel, 1949:, 12; Braudel, 1958a:, 46, 48-50).28 If the pathétisme- thè word is highly charged- is located in the event, in this case, the Revolution, is it therefore too baroque, too excep- tional, too irregulär to be worth studying? If it is lodged, rather, in the historian's treatment, is this not an appréciation more aesthetic than scientific or scholarly? This symbolic violence was all the more troubling to me because I read Labrousse as a piece, Esquisse-cum-Crise, and I construed his approach, in the context of my work on subsistence issues, as 27 It should be dear that I hâve no sympathy with J. H. Plumb's bombastic "history without events is no history at ail," and especially the addendum: "and by events I do not mean the pitter-patter of everyday life . . ." (New York Review ofBooks, Dec. 31, 1972, 7, 14). 28 Cf. Braudel's reminder that he began his career, like a throng of other historians, studying the Revolution, "un terrain de lutte, le conflit essentiel." Péché de jeunesse aside from the methodological transgressions, Braudel noted, like Furet, that the Revolution mattered less and less, was less and less a hot object, as time moved on (Châteauvallon, 1986: 77, 164-65).</page><page sequence="21">THE 1960's 205 inscribed in the long-run, an approach that for me ceded both to the teleological tyranny of the Revolution and to a disdain for day-to-day problems of survival (treated as tiresome accidents, spasms, and outliers) that generated, as I wrote in the introduction to my first book, "an abstract, homogenized social history devoid of flesh and blood and unconvincing despite its scientific cachet" (Kaplan, 1976: I, xx-xxi). Meanwhile, in the colloquium of 200 historians that Labrousse organized at St-Cloud in 1965, Maurice Crubellier made a plea for the "événementialité [du] social" which feil largely upon deaf ears, but bespoke some of my fermenting concerns: Had the liquidation of the event become the unique measure of scientificity? Did not social history increasingly favor "l'humain passif over "l'humain actif," and at what cost? Should not social historians pay more attention to "problème[s] d'échelle" and might it not be useful to complément the macrohistory of "histoire massive" with "la microhistoire des individus et des groupes, et de leur dessein changeant" (Crubellier, 1967: 35ff.)?29 Using an image that speaks to my sensibility, years later, the fervent Labroussian Michel Vovelle affirmed what had become the nouvelle histoire doxa: that the short-run time of the event, which is also the quintessential time of politics, "ne concerne qu'une petite croûte superficielle de l'histoire des hommes." In retrospect, it is clear to me that as others were Trotskyist or Lambertist or Frankist in the 1960's, I was a croûtiste. I was much less certain than Vovelle, and a fortiori Braudel, "que la vraie histoire, comme la vraie vie, est 29 Crubellier is not always wholly cohérent. Even as he laments the history which "fai[t] abstraction des hommes, de leurs aspirations, de leur fantaisie, de leurs projets, de leurs rêves," he seems not be be much concerned with thè banali ties of everyday life and the concerns of every day people (Crubellier, 1967: 35ff.). His antieconomism also strikes me as more viscéral than reflective. Still, despite its amorphousness, it is hard for me not to sympathize with thè idea that "même une histoire qui réussirait à être totale . . . devrait être en même temps existentielle." Cf. Pierre Renouvin's moderate critique of the anathematization of the event in the widely-read summary of current research that he published in the Journal of Modem History (Renouvin, 1966: 11-12). He was willing to concede that events were often ephemeral and that they "obscured the impact of underlying forces." But young Turk historians had gone too far in their disdain for it and their indifférence to what we would cali today agency: "They forget that the 'event' or the 'accident' had a considérable impact on contemporaries unaffected by slow, grand changes and that consequently no study of collective psychology can afford to reject factual history" (1966: 11-12). Renouvin also argued that politics influenced history in important ways even if it did not "make" history and he tried to attenuate the explanatory power of economie variables. Still, this distinguished and thoughtful but old- fashioned historian was very much on the defensive.</page><page sequence="22">206 Steven Kaplan ailleurs" (Vovelle, 1978: 330-31). Passionate Student of bread, equally enamored of crumb and crust- infrastructure and super- structure, I infer from Vovelle's choice of thè image, not from his ideological itinerary- I know from having mis la main à la pâte that thè crust, far from an accident or a décor or an illusion, is ultimately thè expression of thè same forces that construct thè crumb and provides crucial dues concerning thè state of thè whole loaf- or should I say thè miche totale} In any event, as I wrote my dissertation prospectus in early 1967 precisely on thè multiple ways in which bread (and its antécédents) framed and indeed governed life in thè Old Regime, I knew that, along with attentive scrutiny to numerous long-run structures struc- turantes and to "conjunctural" variables, I would have to look closely at politics, from above as well as from below; at subtle and more brutal ways in which power was exercised, exchanged, resisted, and reappropriated; at thè structures as well as thè protean features of everyday life; at the everyday order and how it was sustained and subverted; and at the way crises took root at the confluence of extremely long, middle-range, and very short time. While I worried that I was traducing my masters, I continued to flatter myself that my inspiration and my thinking remained fundamentally Annaliste, deeply if deviantly Braudelian, and elliptically Labroussian. Civilisation matérielle appeared à point nommé, in 1967, shoring up my allegiance and confirming my sensé that I was on to a promising problématique that dovetailed at least in part with Braudel's concep- tions. Although in Paris the affluent usually inhabited the lower floors, Braudel's "rez-de-chaussée de la vie de tous les jours" brought me in to contact with the ordinary producers and consumers who interested me. The text was still peopled with what Hexter called "non-people per- sons": despite the fact that Braudel self-consciously opted for the "masses" over the "vainqueurs," he did not personify them. Taking an aerial view of thè ground floor- of the prison, to transpose his own image, that took différent forms from society to society but issued in the same overwhelming weight of inertia and habit- he focused above ail on "cette frontière qui marque les limites sans souplesse du possible et de l'impossible." Viewing the same scènes from thè ground up in a much narrower purview, I had the impression that there was more suppleness, more space for adjustment, résistance and change, but logically what I saw from Braudel's panopticon reflected merely a fleet- ing and trifling standard déviation.</page><page sequence="23">THE 1960's 207 Still, I was more struck by thè reach and depth of Braudel's cartography than by its rigidity. How could I not feel valorized by a whole chapter on "le pain de chaque jour"- and thè second chapter in thè book! Despite Braudel's austerity, a sort of antipopulist pudeur, or perhaps because of his narrative artistry, as he discussed, in often lush détail, aspects of production and reproduction, tech- niques and technology, food, beverages, clothing, lodging, and money, people-persons pullulated implicitly and metonymically in thè text, explicitly and concretely in thè eyes of thè reader. It was grand structural history that made everything appear intelligible and that made thè reader feel intelligent. Everything seemed foreor- dained, yet uncertainty permeated thè routines, occasionai innova- tions had amplified conséquences precisely because they were so rare, iterative contingencies were stili contingencies despite their harrowing familiarity, thè chronic tension between thè vie matérielle and vie économique created an arena of improvisation and negotia- tion, and thè long-run could not dilute thè riveting drama of thè human condition even if it sternly refused the pathétisme of the daily struggle for survival and stability (Braudel, 1967: 9-15; Hexter, 1972: 518).30 Braudel, along with Georges Perec, whom I read subsequently, whetted my interest for les choses (Perec, 1980). Braudel rendered them worthy of serious investigation, unpacking them and unravel- ing their multiple significations. If he did not frankly code "things" as cultural, Perec-like, he nonetheless insisted on the ways in which materiality shaped the course not only of economie development but of civilization in the most comprehensive sensé of thè word. Follow- ing up on the major Annales project of thè 1960's, he articulated the biological and the social in a mariner that further undermined traditional taxonomies. The ancien régime biologique and the world of things did not displace the Enlightenment or éclipse the coming of the Revolution, but they certainly cast the douceur de vivre and the 50 Braudel surely knew that there was a price to be paid for his audaci ty, his high-wire acrobaties. For example, he made many mistakes-of appréciation, of interprétation, of fact (as I would later learn once I had studied in depth the grain and flour trades, milling, market Systems, and bread production and distribution). National specialists will always be able to take shots at the high-fliers, and there will always be someone to insist, more or less petulantly, that it was différent in Tonga or in the Poitou or in the fourteenth arrondissement.</page><page sequence="24">208 Steven Kaplan misery of the eighteenth Century in a new light.31 Nor was this merely materialism rehabilitated, as one commentator later put it, "pour consoler les orphelins du marxisme."32 It was mapping the historical expérience in a way I had not seen before and in the service of an argument not yet fully spelled out and an ideology not yet wholly revealed. It would be extravagant to daim that Braudel was a turning point in the 1960's for a significant number of American historians. In- deed, it is not at all likely that he was widely read, perhaps not even widely known hère. Surely Labrousse was far more familiär among our French historians. If it would be excessive to speak of "la révolu- tion labroussienne des années 60" as Vovelle does for France, one must agrée with Chaunu that the Esquisse and the Crise exercised considerably more influence than La Méditerranée (Vovelle, 1978: 324; Chaunu, 1974: 21, 26).33 Braudel would not catch up to or supersede Labrousse until thè 1970's, when he penetrated the American scholarly world on myriad fronts, commensurate with the range of his own ambition, reaching well beyond the chapel of French specialists. 51 See, for example, Braudel (1967: 51, 54) and the chapeau in the Annales E.S.C. (XXTV, Nov. 1969: 1). The latter- is it Braudel's voice?- bespeaks a certain irascibility in its denunciation of the subversive bruit that material civilization was merely a passing fashion on the historiographical market place: L'intérêt récemment porté aux différents secteurs de ce qu'il faut appeler très imparfaitement l'histoire matérielle ne révèle pas une mode, comme l'affirment certains esprits attardés, peut-être malveillants, mais la volonté de suivre l'hom- me pas à pas, dans la complexité du tissu historique.
