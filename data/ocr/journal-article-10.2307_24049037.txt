It is also clear, as Volkov and complexes of this region, the ubiquity of stylized Savinov proposed, that these communities over deer imagery of the Mongolian deer stone type, lapped within the Altai regions of Mongolia, 51</page><page sequence="22">jacobson-tepfer: Stylized Deer and Deer Stones of the Mongolian Altai China, and Russia; but what constituted their re lationship within the Altai, and what relation ship these people had with the early nomadic groups that pressed on across the Central Asian steppe: these issues, also, remain unclear. It is correct that a deer image remained the central zoomorphic image of the whole early nomadic world, at least until the late fifth century b.c.e., but the specific treatment of that deer image var ied radically from one part of the early nomadic world to another. The stylized, "Mongolian" im age we have been considering and the specific formulation known as "Sayan" never went fur ther than the early nomadic communities of the T'ien Shan. Perhaps their appearance at such sites as Tamgaly109 in eastern Kazakhstan indicates the westernmost and latest movement of the carriers of the Mongolian deer image. My own surmise is that the stones enwrapped by deer images were intended to stand for gener alized tribal representatives garbed in the weap onry appropriate to a late Bronze Age hunter and facing the East—the direction from which comes sun, spring, and the renewal of life. The small round altars were most certainly used for burnt offerings, but there is no reason to assume that these offerings involved the sacrifice of deer. The deer images themselves must have referred to a tribal sign, totemic or otherwise, or, as I have argued elsewhere, the fundamental sign of both origins and end.110 And until we have other ma terial, that is all that we can safely say about meaning. Notes 1. For fuller discussion of the Early Nomads and the chronology implied by that designation, see below, and n. 9 below. 2. In its early formulations the image is stylistically almost identical to that exemplified by the gold shield plaque from the Scythian burial at Kostromskaya (Kuban region). There is considerable evidence from Mongolian sites that its late formulation should be associated with deer imagery most famously known from the Filippovka burial at the southern tip of the Russian Urals. This will be detailed in the publication of Tsagaan Gol, presently in preparation. 3. In addition to open air petroglyphs, this term, "surface archaeology," comprises large altars (kherek sur), small altars, circles, mounds, and standing stones: those archaeological monuments that are perceived on the surface of the earth. Regarding khereksur, see n. 27. 4. Unfortunately, some of the finest deer stone sites in Mongolia and the Altai Republic have been sig nificantly altered by past archaeological work. See, e.g., n. 40 below. 5. The Tsagaan Salaa/Baga Oigor site has been pub lished (E. Jacobson, V. Kubarev, and D. Tseevendorj, Repertoire des Pätroglyphes d'Asie Centrale, fasc. 6, Mongolie du Nord-Ouest, Tsagaan Salaa/Baga Oigor, 2 vols. [Paris, 2001]; hereafter referred to as Tsagaan Salaa/Baga Oigor). Regarding the Tsagaan Gol complex, see E. Jacobson, D. Tseveendorj, and V. D. Kubarev, "A Petroglyphic Complex in the Upper Tsagaan Gol Valley, Mongolian Altay," International Newsletter on Rock Art, no. 32 (2002), pp. 16. The full report on this com plex is being prepared for publication. 6. This term is used by Soviet and Russian scholars to refer to what we would call the iconographical and iconological meanings of a motif or composition. 7. Exceptions to this rule include some discussion of rock art imagery by E. A. Novgorodova, D. G. Savinov, and V. D. Kubarev, but their brief discussions are tan gential to the larger topic of the deer stone. See works cited below. For a fuller discussion of this and other deer images of the late Bronze and early Iron Ages in North Asia, see E. Jacobson, The Deer Goddess of An cient Siberia: A Study in the Ecology of Belief (Leiden, 1993). It is admittedly awkward to make a distinction be tween the imagery pecked into the standing stones called deer stones and that found within rock art sites: both represent variations on the petroglyph. In order to maintain a working distinction here, however, I will use the term "petroglyph" only for the imagery that appears in open-air sites on bedrock and erratic boul ders, in contrast to those images found on deer stones. 8. A broken figure of a male from the Kuban, now in the Krasnodar Museum, seems to be wearing a plaque of a deer on its chest. See Jacobson, The Deer Goddess of Ancient Siberia, p. 163, pi. XXIf; and P. N. Shul'ts, "Skifskiye izvayaniya," in Khudozhestven naya kul'tura i arkheologiya antichnogo mira (Mos cow, 1976), fig. 6. 9. The designation "early nomadic" is here used to refer to the period in North Asia describing the tran sition from the late Bronze to the early Iron Ages (late 2nd-early 1st millennia b.c.e.) and the emergence of an increasingly horse dependent semi-nomadism. The Early Nomads would then refer to the peoples who made that transition in life style and from the Bronze to the early Iron Age. Although a number of named cultures are associated with the transition—most particularly Karasuk and Tagar—there is as yet no agreement as to the cultural affiliation of the Early Nomads or of those early nomadic people who must 52</page><page sequence="23">jacobson-tepfer: Stylized Deer and Deer Stones of the Mongolian Altai have left the Altai region in the late Bronze Age and brought North Asian horse dependency and the so called "Scythian triad" to the shores of the Black Sea. The term has been used, capitalized and not, by a num ber of scholars; see, e.g., M. Gryaznov, "The Age of the Early Nomads," chapter III in his Southern Siberia (Geneva, 1969); and V. V. Volkov, Olennye kamni Mon golii (Ulan-Bator, 1981), p. 118. 10. See, for example, the recumbent deer from Chi liktin, Kazakhstan, dated to the 7th c., and the large golden deer plaque from the Kostromskaya burial, in the Kuban, dated to the late 7th-early 6th c. 11. See, for example, Tsagaan Salaa/Baga Oigor, vol. 2, pis. 140, 247, 248. The history of the deer image in the Mongolian Altai will be detailed in the publi cation of the Tsagaan Gol complex. 12. For a discussion of this period, see, e.g., A. P. Okladnikov, Istoriya Sibiri (Leningrad, 1968), vol. 1, pp. 172-87; Gryaznov, Southern Siberia, pp. 89-130. 13. See, inter alia, Ν. I. Dorofeyuk and P. E.

Dorofeyuk, P. E. Tarasov, and C. C. Black, Vegetation Dynamics of Mongolia (Dor drecht, 1999). 14.1 have detailed this argument and its supporting documentation elsewhere. See, inter alia, Jacobson, "Petroglyphs and the Qualification of Bronze Age Mor tuary Archaeology," Archaeology, Ethnology, and An thropology of Eurasia 3(11) (2002), pp. 32-47; Tsagaan Salaa/Baga Oigor, vol. 1, pp. 7-33; and E. Jacobson Tepfer, "The Emergence of Semi-Nomadic Pastoralism in the Mongolian Altai: Rock Art and Paleoenviron ment," forthcoming in the publication of the Fourth Cotsen Seminar on Nomadism (UCLA), ed. H. Barnard and W. Z. Wendrich. 15. This is well documented in many petroglyphs datable to the late Bronze Age in the complexes of Tsa gaan Salaa/Baga Oigor and Tsagaan Gol. This period also, I would argue, saw the first appearance of Bac trian camels in the Altai region, and in many of the earliest representations of camels they are being rid den. See Tsagaan Salaa/Baga Oigor, vol. 2 , pis. 184, 344, 345. 16. Ibid., pis. 217, 218, 262, 331-34, 393. 17. Although the mortuary evidence for this hy pothesis is ambiguous, it is occasionally suggested by petroglyphs of the late Bronze Age. In that material, social conflict was a far less significant subject for representation than was hunting, herding, or moving households; but there are enough scenes of raids or ap parent conflict over hunting grounds to make one take notice. This is particularly noteworthy in the still unpublished materials of Tsagaan Gol; but see, ibid., pis. XXIV, pp. 369-71. 18.1 offer this hypothesis on the basis of the docu mentation of hundreds of petroglyphic images from the Altai Mountains. To the best of my knowledge, there is no surviving record from excavation archaeol ogy to prove or disprove this argument; on the other hand, by the time we get to burials of the late Bronze and early Iron Age, it is apparent that riders were car rying large numbers of arrows in a quiver form known as a gorytus. Those arrows were shorter than would have been used for a long Bronze Age bow. The gorytus allowed the hunter or rider to store his recurved bow within the case, together with the arrows. This is well represented by the scene in fig. 1. 19. M. Cremades, "Les Cervides," in L'Ait Parietal Pateolithique (Paris, 1993), pp. 143-44. 20. See E. Jacobson, "Siberian Roots of the Scythian Stag Image," Journal of Asian History 17 (1983), pp. 117-20. 21. See, for example, those discussed in D. G. Savi nov, Olennye kamni ν kul'ture kochevnikov Evrazii (St. Petersburg, 1994), pis. IV, V, XXII. 22. Ibid., pp. 75-78. 23. Ibid., pp. 131-34. Savinov implies that the infre quently represented feline is a counterpart to the more frequently seen wild boar. Since, in his estimation, the boar is a sign of the sacrifice of the deer, the feline, also, represents that aspect of the stones' semantics (ibid., pp. 130-31). 24. This is quickly observable in the major corpus of Altai deer stones, collected and discussed by V. D. Kubarev (Drevnie izvayanie Altaiya [Novosibirsk, 1979]). 25. See above, n. 8. 26. The most recent and comprehensive discussion of deer stones is that of D. G. Savinov (Olennye kam ni). More recently the landmark study of Mongolian deer stones by Volkov, Olennye kamni Mongolii, has been reissued (Moscow, 2002) with far better reproduc tions than were included in the original publication (1981). 27. These surface structures are characterized by a large central mound, an enclosing circular or squared "wall" or boundary marker, and—often, but not al ways—by rays or radii extending from the central mound to the enclosing "wall." These rays are gener ally aligned with the four quarters and with their subdivisions. In recent years there has been an increas ing interest in khereksur and in whether or not they served as burials. In the opinion of this author, these structures were built as altars, on which may then and later have been performed sacrifices. The small circular rings that so frequently accompany them were 53</page><page sequence="24">jacobson-tepfer: Stylized Deer and Deer Stones of the Mongolian Altai more certainly the locations of burnt offerings. Later peoples occasionally inserted burials in the central mounds, but there is as yet no convincing evidence that the khereksur were originally conceived as buri als. Several khereksur mounds have been excavated, in Tuva, in the Altai Republic, and in Mongolia, and the results appear to be inconclusive. Their design sug gests that khereksur could have been used in ceremo nies intended, on some level, to reaffirm order in this world and in the next. It is also possible that they were used in relationship to the consecration of surface burials, the traces of which have long since been lost. In this paper, the term, khereksur, will refer to a sin gular or plural number. 28. Savinov, Olennye kamni, p. 9. 29. Ibid., p. 10. 30. Ibid., pp. 10-11. 31. A.

The stone from Bayan bulak sum, Bayan Khongor aimag, is reproduced in Volkov, Olennye kamni Mongolii (1981), pi. 34/2; that from Undurkhangai sum, ibid., pi. 69/4; and on a stone from Khiadag, Burentogtokh sum, Hövsgöl aimag (personal documentation). On the stone from Un durkhangai appears to be the image of a Mongolian stylized deer, on that from Bayanbulak—two or three recumbent deer (or one deer and a moose?) of the Sayan type, and no other zoomorphic images on that from Khiadag. In addition, of course, the coiled feline is rep resented in a magnificent if unprovenanced plaque from the Siberian Treasure of Peter the Great, housed in the Hermitage State Museum; and in several small gold plaques from the 7th c. burial of Chiliktin, Khaza khstan. On these images and others, see Jacobson, The Deer Goddess of Ancient Siberia, pp. 50-51. 38. The problem here is that the location of the fragmentary stone within the rubble of the burial mound could indicate that the stone itself was earlier or later than the burial; that it represents the reuse of a previously destroyed stone, the destruction of a stone for the purpose of adding to the burial mound, or the opportunistic addition to the mound of an avail able—and by then meaningless—fragment. In other words, its relationship to the burial itself is thoroughly unclear. 39. V. V. Volkov and E. A. Novgorodova, "Olennye kamni Ushkiin Uvera (Mongoliya)," in Peivobytnaya arkheologiya Sibiii (Leningrad, 1975), pp. 78-84. 40. Unfortunately, this stone and several others were incorrectly reoriented when the researchers re constructed the site. The face stone, the southernmost within the row on the west, now faces to the south, whereas it should have faced to the east. 41. E. A.

Kubarev, Dievnye izvayaniya Altaya, pp. 19-20, fig. 11. The attempt to date this stone to the early Bronze Age is particularly problematic in light of the Karasuk-Tagar (i.e., late Bronze Age, early Iron Age) dagger and battle-axe pecked into the stone's surface. 56. Unpublished field observations. Materials sup porting this position will be included in the publication of the Tsagaan Gol complex, presently in preparation. 57. These round altars are also "generic." They are found most numerously around khereksur and were apparently intended to be used for burnt offerings. The appropriateness of their form to their function proba bly dictated why this specific altar type should have 54</page><page sequence="25">jacobson-tepfer: Stylized Deer and Deer Stones of the Mongolian Altai lasted several thousand years across the Bronze and early Iron Ages. 58. The Sogoogin Gol stone has not been pub lished. That from Inya is not published in an avail able source. 59. These image stones are well known in Mongolia, Tuva, the Altai Republic, and beyond into Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and northern China. It should be pointed out that there is one later phase in the tradition of stone imagery in Mongolia, that of the Mongols themselves. Without question this tradi tion depended upon the previous Turkic stone image tradition and its deep roots in prehistory. Regarding these Mongolian images, see D. Bayar, Mongolyn töv nutag dakh' tuiegiin khun chuluu (Ulaanbaatar, 1997); and for Turkic and Mongolian period stones in Mon golia, see L. Dashnyam et al., Mongol nutag dakh' tuukh soelyn dursgal (Ulaanbaatar, 1999), pp. 93-138. 60. See V. D. Kubarev and D. Tseveendorj, "Ancient Turkic Memorials in the Altai," Archaeology, Ethnol ogy, et) Anthropology of Eurasia 1.9 (2002), pp. 76-95. 61. There are many such combinations in the Tsa gaan Gol complex and elsewhere in mountainous Bayan Ölgiy. 62. See above, n. 7. 63. One damaged stone has been reset within a Turkic enclosure, itself in immediate proximity to two khereksur and several other Turkic enclosures. Higher in the valley, in the section of the petroglyphic site designated as Shiviit Khairkhan, we located a second, broken stone that, curiously, stood on the west side of a mound of unknown significance. This stone was marked as a deer stone only by the large rings on the side of its "head." 64. Dashnyam et al., Mongol nutag, pp. 87-88. The grey-white stone has a clearly carved face. There is a strange protruding area on the "face" side of the bluish stone, suggesting that it, also, may have been intended as a face. The fact that the grey-white stone faces south and the blue stone faces east is another indication that this was not the original location of both stones. 65. Work in this valley by the Joint MAR Project took place in the summer of 1998 and, more briefly, in 2003. 66. Dashnyam et al., Mongol nutag, pp. 78-79. 67. See, for example, Volkov, Olennye kamni Mon golii (2002), pis. 5/2, 3; 8/3; 9; 10; 12/1, 2, 3; 18/1; 24/ 2; 36/2; 46/2; 48; 56/1, 2; 60/2, 5; 61/2; 81/1; 82/3; 99/ 1, 2; 100/2; 106/1; 110; 133/3. It is curious that a few of the Black Sea stones said to be "Cimmerian" in ori gin were also carved with "heads" at both ends. See stones from Ust'Labinsk and Zubovskii khutor (Chle nova, Olennye kamni kak istoricheskii istochnik, figs. 2-4.) 68. A recent discussion of Mongolian deer stones interpreted the upward or downward position of the deer images on the stones as indicating the movement of the deer between Heaven and Earth. See J. Magail, "Mongolian 'Stag Stones/" International Newsletter on Rock Art, no. 39 (2004), pp. 17-27. 69. Scholars frequently surmise that the inverted position indicates the reuse of the stone at a time later than its original raising. Even if the stone was reused, it is hard to understand why it would have been put into the ground "head" down when it would have been just as easy to set it in a correct position. Clearly the inverted position was deliberate and meaningful. 70. Jacobson, unpublished field notes. 71. We have recorded two other deer stones of a very simple Type III: one within the construction of a khereksur in the eastern section of Tsagaan Asgat com plex, and another behind the "Black Mountain," at Kharganatiin Gol. Both are as yet unpublished. 72. See the deer stone within a small altar, at Zhar galant, Erdenimandal sum, Arkhangai aimag in Volkov, Olennye kamni (1981), pi. 21. 73. The only image occurring occasionally on deer stones but not found within the petroglyphic record of Bayan Ölgiy is that of the curled feline; on the other hand, there are significant examples of representa tions of felines that are crouched or rampant, or in the process of attacking their prey. See, e.g., Tsagaan Sa laa/Baga Oigor, vol. 2, pi. 240; and forthcoming pub lication of Tsagaan Gol. 74. Ibid., pis. 247, 248. 75. Ibid., pis. 46, 47.

Although a variety of appellations have been coined to distinguish cultures of the late Bronze and early Iron Ages (e.g., Karasuk, Tagar, Pazyryk), I am increasingly uncomfort able with these distinctions and with what, exactly, they purport to mean. 91. Savinov, Olennye kamni, p. 129. 92. Ibid., pp. 146-50. 93. In TS-IV there is a fine representation of a male figure holding a dagger of the Karasuk type (Tsagaan Salaa/Baga Oigor, vol. 2, pi. 157). In the complex of the upper Tsagaan Gol, in two cases, we have to do with simple representations of daggers. A third case is curiously and instructively a large dagger held by a woman. In a forth case, within an elaborate scene of combat, one figure appears to be stabbing another. It should be added that such a scene of close-combat violence is unique among the thousands of carved surfaces we have documented. This material will be included in the publication of the Tsagaan Gol site. 94. Savinov, Olannye kamni, pi. IV/4. 95. E.

Shortly after the deer had been pecked over the earlier scene, the boulder appears to have been split by light ening. Its parts scattered in such a way that the images became well preserved. 99. In general, one can follow a "rule of thumb" in attempting to discern petroglyphic images or compo sitions that are significant. If, within one complex, an unusual image occurs once, one notes it; if twice, one becomes alert to its possible significance; if three or more times, one should begin to pay careful attention. And when it occurs more than several times in more than one complex, then one is faced with an element that must have had considerable significance. 100. See, for example, the horse crest from Pazyryk 2 and the deer images sewn on a man's caftan from the same burial (S. I. Rudenko, Frozen Tombs of Siberia [Berkeley, 1970], pis. 142/D, 151A). 101. This point can be supported by examining a whole range of symbolic elements beyond birds and horned and antlered animals.

Scattered stones may refer to disrupted small al tars, but the two lowest deer stones seem to have been thrust unceremoniously into the skirt of the kherek sur. This site has been the object of investigations led by Dr. William W. Fitzhugh, Arctic Studies Center, Department of Anthropology, National Museum of Natural Flistory, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.; see The Hovsgol Deer Stone Project, 2001-2002 Field Report (Arctic Studies Center, 2003), pp. 43-48. 107. These questions and others are discussed in Jacobson, "Petroglyphs and the Qualification of Bronze Age Mortuary Archaeology," Archaeology, Ethnology, and Anthropology of Eurasia 3.11 (2002), pp. 32-47. 108. See, in that regard, Savinov's final discussion of the deer stone as "historical source," in Savinov, Olennye kamni, pp. 151-65. 109. Personal, unpublished documentation. See, also, Z. Samashev, Petroglyphs of the East Kazakhstan as a Historical Sources [sic] (Almaty, 1993), pp. 62-65. The gold hoard recently found at Chiliktin argues for a close relationship between the people responsible for that burial and those responsible for Arzhan II in Tuva (personal documentation). 110.
