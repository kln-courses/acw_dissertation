<plain_text><page sequence="1">RELIGION AND ANTHROPOLOGY S. F. MAcLENNAN Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio This paper is written from the genetic viewpoint and traces the bearings of anthro- pology and history upon the science of religion. Anthropology shows us that religion is an integral function of the human social order: that it varies with the evolution of this order: that its final test must consist in its human service (a) as reflecting the fundamental, effective values of man's life and (b) as also reflecting man's more permanent and intelligent attitudes toward his environment. From primitive times to the present day, religion has exhibited two permanent types. As these appear in savage life they are denominated animistic and naturistic: as they are exhibited by our highest civilizations they are spoken of as monotheistic and pantheistic. The one is distinctively human in temperament: the other is cosmic. The future form of religion would appear to depend upon whether man masters his environment and dedicates his powers to worthy social ends or whether man's environment masters him and extinguishes creative impulse toward human uplift. It is a matter of curious interest that, coincident with the sharp decline in theological values during the past seventy- five years, there should have been an increasingly sharp and constant rise in religious values. It will scarcely be doubted that the rise and development of modern philosophy and science, but more especially the growth of historical and comparative criticism, has reduced the prestige of theology-ordinarily so called-to a very low if not, indeed, to a vanishing point. The intelligent world of today cares little, if anything, for the theological shibboleths of our fathers. And yet, to this same intelligent world of today, religion is an object of abiding, vital interest. The question, indeed, con- cerns no longer the "reality" of religion but rather its definition, its function, its range: the description of its objects and pro- cesses; in a word, its orientation in this new, modern, and contemporary social order. Nowadays, one has as much right, intellectually, to speak of religion as to speak of art, or literature or science or philosophy. Serious conflict may arise in any one of these fields, but to the intelligent, instructed mind they all have "reality." 600</page><page sequence="2">RELIGION AND ANTHROPOLOGY 6oi The above-mentioned status of religion is the product of many and diverse inquiries-a rising new theology which keeps more in touch with science and philosophy than the old; the keen and ordered examinations of religious literatures by exegete, historical critic and comparative religionist; the work of the nature sciences especially as concerns the problems of life and mind; the cultivation of the vast and remunerative fields of the social order; the implications of a more natural and evolutionary ethics; the pragmatic thrust of philosophical insights, both negative and positive. These and many other forces have co-operated to the result-the status of religion as an objective and significant reality. Of these numerous and varied forces I shall trace the influ- ence of but one-that of anthropology. We shall find, how- ever, that its influence is fundamental both in giving a sense of reality to religion and in defining it. Anthropology is to the life of primitive man what history, taken in the broadest sense of the term, is to the subsequent periods of his development. History seeks to describe, accu- rately, man's life, especially man's deeds, and, as far as may be, the circumstances which conditioned those deeds and that life. Similarly, anthropology aims to reveal to our view the life of man in all the facts and principles of his culture from its most primitive to its most civilized state. Now one of the most unquestionable as it is one of the most significant results of anthropological science is the fact that religion is inseparable from human life and human society. Nay, we may even go so far as to contend that anthropology compels us to recognize not merely that religion is inseparable from the human process, but also that it is essential thereto. No matter to what phase or stage of human culture we turn we find religion, and, moreover, we find it everywhere close-locked with the deepest impulses and dearest interests of mankind. Religion is not a late product of human speculation; nor is it a superficial circumstance in man's life; its currents are the</page><page sequence="3">602 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION underswelling tides of life; it infests human life universally. But to recognize such things as these is to admit that religion possesses objective quality. It can no longer be treated as a subjective affair in the sense in which "subjectivity" is made coincident with "unreality." If, however, religion be accorded an objective status, if it possesses real entity in this present hard-pan world of ours, the question as to its nature, origin, and function becomes one of absorbing interest, and anthropology finds it to be such. One of the puzzling problems of the modern theologian has been to obtain a satisfactory definition of religion. In earlier days the difficulty was not so pressing inasmuch as the known religious forms were much fewer and there was a more uniform agreement in man's attitude toward them. On the other hand, during the past century and a half the field of the world's reli- gions has been canvassed with increasing zeal and effectiveness, the result being that an awakening consciousness as to the mul- tiplicity of religious forms has so obscured the apprehension of their unity-if such there be-that definition has become well- nigh an impossibility. Yet, of necessity, definitions there have been, and with certain of these we are, all of us, familiar, e.g.: "Religion is the true relation of the soul to God." " It is com- munion with God." "It is the belief in an ever living God." "It is the apprehension of the infinite." " It is the mystical union with God." "It is a feeling of absolute dependence upon God." "It is the consciousness of our practical relation to an invisible spiritual order." "Religion is the attempt to express the complete reality of goodness through every aspect of our being." "Religion might be identified with his [man's] attitude, whatever it might be, toward what he felt to be the primal truth." These definitions are sufficiently varied we may, perhaps, be agreed, and they are equally true. Each de- scribes a definite body of religious beliefs. In them religion voices its virile presence through intellectual, emotional, or volitional media. But none of them-or so it seems to me-</page><page sequence="4">RELIGION AND ANTHROPOLOGY 603 meets the demands of definition as applied to the full body of religious facts nor furnishes us with a tool adequate to the proper cultivation and understanding of religion in its lowest as truly as in its highest forms. As a matter of fact the above- quoted definitions of religion are based upon highly developed religious forms. They lack both the completeness and the fundamental character that is necessary if we are both to under- stand sympathetically other religions than our own and also to grasp the principle by means of which religion may continuously readjust itself to its ever changing environment and thus renew the well-springs of its life. With the desire, then, to put ourselves in contact with a more dynamic conception of religion than is represented by the definitions previously quoted and at the same time to clarify, to some extent, my own thinking, I ask your attention to a brief discussion of the work being done along these lines by certain of our anthropologists, and more especially by Emile Durkheim in his Elementary Forms of the Religious Life. If our discussion were taking a wider range we should be compelled to pay tribute to the foundational work done by such men as Tylor; Robertson Smith; J. G. Frazer; Spencer; Gillen; Rivers; Marett; L6vy-Bruhl; Crawley; Ames; and by Miss Jane Harrison, among others. According to the analysis of Durkheim two fundamental factors are to be found in religion. Religion concerns itself at bottom with the sacred and with the divine: in other words, it has to do with the sanctities and with the divinities of life, however differently these matters have been envisaged by the successive generations and races of men. In this conception of religion, Durkheim, I believe, stands upon solid ground. Whatever else religion may or may not be, it feeds upon sanctities and lives only in the atmosphere of the divinities. Eliminate all sense of the sacred in life and you destroy religion: destroy the divinities and, whatever else may remain, religion vanishes away. On the other hand does not</page><page sequence="5">604 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION religion deepen and expand as our sense of the sacred deepens and expands ? Does not religion germinate and grow increas- ingly with the sense of the divine ? It may be objected that our sense of the sacred and the divine is utterly subjective and illusory. The contention in itself is a fair one and must be met by the religionist. But it is not in point here. If true, the objection would lead to the discarding of religion and with that result--or with the reverse-we are not, logically, for the moment concerned. What is of importance is to recognize that the experience of the sanctities and the divinities of life consti- tutes the essence of all religion. At its lowest observable levels, in its highest forms, and in all the stages between, religion lives and moves and has its being in the medium of the sacred and the divine. Furthermore, these two factors in religion are everywhere present. Sometimes one factor is predominant and sometimes the other, but the presence of both is essential to the fact. Another way of stating the same point is to say that, although some religions are more explicitly human and some more explicitly cosmic in type, all religions are essentially both human and cosmic. This point becomes especially suggestive when we anticipate a later result and point out that "sanctities" are essentially human, whereas "divinities" are essentially cosmic. In coincidence with the foregoing statement Durkheim points out that elementary forms of religion divide themselves into two contrasted types. To these he gives the names animistic and naturistic. They agree in their common regard for spiritual values, but they differ-and fundamentally-in that the one finds its control center in human values and principles, whereas cosmic principles and cosmic significance constitute the control center of the other. By animistic religions Durkheim understands those in which the religious object (or objects) are thought of as being akin, in nature, to the human subject. Human characteristics and</page><page sequence="6">RELIGION AND ANTHROPOLOGY 605 human ways are the ways and characteristics of the spirits, of whatever order they may be. True, every spirit is, in fact, a part of nature, a cosmic force, but in all animistic religions the characteristic feature is a belief in the essential kinship or community of kind between the religious subject and the reli- gious object. Hence, we need not be surprised to find that in animistic religions prayer is the characteristic mode of approach to and control of the religious object. As man may converse with, appeal to, argue with, another man, so equally man may converse with, appeal to, argue with, the spirits. By naturistic religions Durkheim understands those in which the religious object (or objects) is distinctively a cosmic and not a human force. Whatever spiritual values man may find in the cosmos, however much he may seek to adjust his life, beneficially, to it or to its multiple forces in all nature religions, the religious object lacks, as its characteristic dominat- ing feature, the element of human kinship. However vaguely felt or described, elementary nature religions, such as fetich- ism, totemism, tree-worship, etc., embody their spiritual values in an It rather than in a Thou. Accordingly, in primitive nature religions, the method of control of the religious object is not prayer but magic. The religious object cannot properly be appealed to; it can only be manipulated. I would next have you observe that this contrast in elemen- tary religious types holds true throughout the entire history of religion: it is as marked and significant today as it ever was. In the earliest known form of primitive society-the kinship group-we are met by spiritism and totemism at the very threshold; the one religion being, as we have seen, animistic, the other naturistic. At the close of this epoch we encounter, on the one hand, ancestor-worship and the tribal worship of anthropomorphic, animistic deities; on the other hand, we meet the worship of animals, trees, rivers, mountains, the heavenly bodies, fire, etc., conceived either boldly as mysterious</page><page sequence="7">606 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION nature forces or through such a thin veil of animism that the essential naturism of the worship is clearly perceptible. But time passes, and here and there about the world-groups, families, and tribes are welded together into more complex organizations, and the nations arise with their autocratic mili- tary and ecclesiastical leaders: kinship as the all-dominant social band is displaced by patriotism and retires to the lesser realms of control. The individual slowly emerges as a subject of rights and duties in himself, though these rights and duties are mere gifts and obligations granted to and laid on him by sovereign authority in return for individual loyalty to the sovereign, to the state, its common institutions, and its common laws. We designate such a great social change an advance and perhaps we are right; perhaps, as some would say, not. But, be this as it may, the emergence of the nations with their centralized authority, their more or less unified institutions and laws, their intense emphasis upon individual loyalty to their several national heads-this emergence, I say, was accompanied by a transformation of religion into distinctly national forms in which each form was characterized and stamped with the genius of the national life from which it sprang. Now these new national religions are some of them animis- tic and some of them naturistic in type. In Greece and Israel the gods or god developed as great anthropomorphic deities, human in their entirety; among the Greeks as natural men endowed with powers superhuman; among the Hebrews as a spirit infinitely exalted but with a consciousness closely akin to the human. In Egypt and in India the gods are theriomor- phic, therianthropic, or thinly veiled powers of nature-the sky, the atmosphere, the lightning, fire, the earth, etc., in all their exalted power in themselves and in their control over the destinies of men. Now, with this distinction of animistic and naturistic types of religion clearly in mind, let us look a little more closely at the development of the religions of Israel and of India.</page><page sequence="8">RELIGION AND ANTHROPOLOGY 607 I believe it is safe to say that the Hebrews and the Hindus are the world's most typical and significant examples of charac- teristically religious peoples. They are peoples of dominantly religious genius, but they are oppositely religious. The Hebrew religion is essentially humanistic; the Hindu is essen- tially cosmic. The God of Israel is, throughout its history, a personal god -the epitome and ideal of culture as conceived by the Hebrews, objectified and thrown upon the background of the world. Hence the religion of Israel lives in the realm of human ideals, especially the moral, and operates in terms of human relations. Loyalty--an essentially human loyalty--whether defined as the appeal of kin, or as feudal loyalty to an autocratic king, or as a freeman's service to a moral creator and world-ruler, or again, as in the religion of Jesus, the interested, loyal, and loving participation of children in an ideal home life where God is the Father, the social order is the home, and all mankind are the children. In such a religion God is reduced completely to human terms, and man becomes the measure of the cosmic. No relation is true which is not a humanized relation. Prayer becomes naturally the mode of contact with and participation in the divine. Human culture in its varied forms provides the means for defining the "sanctities" and the "divinities" of life. Social life and service-our common, everyday living-open to us our true religious expression and the real test of our loyalty. Thus the animism of primitive religion, expanded to its full limits, becomes the concrete personalism of the religion of Jesus. On the other hand, the gods of India are cosmic in character and, under the influence of their own internal development, drop the alien veil of personality and expose their true character in an impersonal monism-a true pantheism. To the Hindu, God is the universal cosmic principle, and religion consists in union with that principle-the realization of the divine. The final religious equation of Indian thought is Atman-Brahman, i.e., there is an absolute identity, in reality, between the soul of</page><page sequence="9">608 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION man and the cosmic principle. And both soul and cosmic principle are impersonal in essence. Thus to find Atman is to find Brahman, but to accomplish this one must slough off all personalism and must attune one's life to the impersonal veri- ties of things. To the writers of the Upanishads and the Vedanta, spiritual values are fundamentally and eternally real, but they are essentially, yet intensely, objective and impersonal. Now, to keep in touch with the cosmic forces upon which he felt his life to be dependent and to bind these forces to his well-being, the Indian first employed magic-the crude magic of the Atharva Veda. Soon this method passed over into the world-controlling formulas of the Brahmans. Lastly, it fashioned itself into a method of inner concentration by which it was believed man might free himself from the illu- sions of the human, personal viewpoint and attain truth, viz., participation in the all pervading but impersonal being. Tomorrow, to judge from current movements and thoughts, science will replace magic, ritual, and inner concentration as the method of divine realization and, for the Hindu, religion and science will walk hand in hand. In such a religion personal- ism and prayer have no place; they belong to the realm of illusions. Truth is to be found only in the non-personal, the objective, the impersonal, the naturistic, i.e., in Brahman. To my mind, Christianity and Vedantism, as thus roughly outlined, furnish the types of positive religious forms upon which the modern world must build. The one is the full expression of a religion in which the human factor is dominant and the cosmic is subordinate in function; the other is the full expression of a religion in which the cosmic swallows up the human factor and makes objective naturism supreme. Opposed to both Christianity and Vedantism stands Buddhism. It may perhaps be described as a negative religion. It denies human values and is agnostic toward ultimate prin- ciples. Yet it is more than a morality; it is a veritable religion-a religion in which both human and cosmic factors</page><page sequence="10">RELIGION AND ANTHROPOLOGY 609 are written in negative terms. One might speak of it as a negative Christianity or as a critical Vedantism. Beyond these three there is no other universal religion of pure and distinct type. Mohammedanism, the only claimant, belongs to the animistic type and is of mongrel breed. If, then, we may correctly say that religion is "a realization of the sacred in life and a sense of the divine in the cosmos," if every religion possesses, to its own being, both human and cosmic factors, though now the one and now the other comes uppermost, the further and fundamental questions arise: Whence the sacred ? Whence the divine? Do the "sancti- ties" and "divinities" of human life spring from human soil ? How are they related to cosmic activity ? Durkheim's attitude toward these problems I shall endeavor to state as directly and as briefly as possible. To Durkheim it is incontestable that "sanctities" and "divinities" are human products. The day of sheer super- naturalism has gone by. If, as the facts warrant us in main- taining, religion be indigenous to human life and to human society, everything that is sacred and all that is divine must also spring therefrom. But whence the sacred ? To Durkheim, the sacred is the vehicle, the bearer, the exponent of those human values which are most deep-set, common, well established, significant, and controlling in life and society. Whatever appears to be essen- tial to man's life, whatever grips him or his society centrally and controls his action throughout, whatever distils essentially his permanent interests-that, whatever it may be, gathers to itself sanctity. Thus, to primitive man, the fundamentals and essentials of his group life and organization appear as things sacred. Among the natives of Australia the media of their cultus-stones, storehouses, ceremonies, totems and their repre- sentations, rocks, rivers, hills, etc.-possess sanctity of the most pronounced order. Indeed, among all primitive peoples, the customs which embody group organization and control are</page><page sequence="11">6Io THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION universally held to be sacred. They are held to be sacred because it is commonly believed that they are essential to the life and well-being of the group and that this has been so from the beginning. Similarly, priests, chiefs, patriarchs, kings, institutions, forces of nature, as they have gained the attention of men and have entered vitally into the life of mankind have each and all taken on religious, i.e., sacred quality. To attack a priest, to pollute a temple, to consume the flesh of a sacrifice without warrant, mean not only to profane sanctities but also to arouse the deepest passions of men, and for the very good reason that such action touches fundamental beliefs of men to the very quick. Kings are nowadays passing rapidly into the discard for the reason that, in this democratic age, they exercise an increasingly diminishing r6le in the social life and order to which they belong. Yet we have all heard of "the divine right of kings"-a doctrine once sacrosanct and, therefore, supposedly unalterable. Kings became sacrosanct and even divine because throughout the history of the autocratic state they, with the high priests, also sacrosanct, were the perma- nent and fundamental media of social organization. The caste system of India first appears, in the history of that people, as a rough division of labor. There were soldiers, priests, agricul- turists or herdsmen, and, a little later, slaves, the four forming the foundation castes of India-Kshatriya, Brahman, Vaisya, Sudra. As time wore on, the priest class gained control of Hindu social and political life, indeed of its entire corpus. As this control was gained the priest grew in significance and in sanctity until it was said of him: " There are two kinds of gods, for the gods are gods, and priests that are learned in the Veda are gods." The exceedingly modern Hindu religion of Sikhism organized the lives of its devotees about the sayings of Nanak, which were embodied in the volume known as the Granth. Pre-eminently susceptible to religion, as Hindus are wont to be, the Sikhs had their religious beliefs driven in on them by the sharpest kind of persecution. As a result, the Granth ceased</page><page sequence="12">RELIGION AND ANTHROPOLOGY 611 to be regarded as a mere volume of religious literature. It first passed into the realm of the sacred and is now worshiped as a divinity. These illustrations will be sufficient, I believe, to make clear the convictions of Durkheim and with him, of many contempo- rary anthropologists as to the origin and function of the sacred. But to prevent misunderstanding one further point may be noted. The question may be raised: Does not the sacred often embody future ideals and not merely register past accomplish- ments ? And I answer, "Yes, but the principle of explana- tion remains the same." For example, looking forward, any principle, any institution, any program that is intensely held by individuals or by groups and that is believed by them to be fundamentally essential to future well-being and reconstruc- tion will gather sanctity to itself and take on distinctly reli- gious coloring. There are individuals today who hold intensely the conviction that the free rights of individuals are being undermined and that the future of democracy and a livable society is being menaced. Many such individuals, uplifted by the thought of all that is humanly at stake, exhibit, as they throw themselves into the fight, a truly prophetic zeal, a holy fervor, a sacred passion. Does not the socialist, in challenging the past and present social order, feel profoundly that he is basing his claims and his actions upon the sacred rights of men-his fellow-men, although his fellow-workers first ? He may often rest his argument upon an economic materialism, perhaps, but is not his controlling motive a con- viction, absolute and passionate, that his cause is a sacred cause and that upon its success the one true future depends ? Sanctities, therefore, whether static or dynamic, are of the essence of human life. But what of "divinities," the companion pieces of sancti- ties ? "Divinities" are duplex in character, they are "cosmic," and they are also "humanistic."</page><page sequence="13">612 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION Few will deny that divinities are thought of as being essen- tially cosmic in nature. They are "powers not ourselves" that have a deep and abiding significance for men. Spirits, fetiches, totems, gods-what are they but phases of the cosmos, natural and human, or the total cosmos itself ? Trees, animals, plants, heavenly bodies, mountains, rivers, the over- arching sky, the atmospheric changes, heaven, earth, the mysteries of life and reproduction, the sun, the moon, the stars, the ocean, the volcano-these and many other features of the cosmos have been and still are the materials of which "divinities" are made. They became "divinities " not because of themselves but because of their supposed influence in human life. The point of this contention may, perhaps, be made clear by a brief reference to the ancient Hindu god Indra. Indra finds his opposite and enemy in Vritra. Vritra is the demon, ceaselessly active, whose abiding and persistent purpose is to impound the heavenly cows (the clouds) and thus to prevent men (the prot6g6s of Indra) from obtaining milk (rain) for their fields. To fight Vritra and to stave off from his people drought, famine, pestilence, is the abiding duty of Indra, the god of the atmosphere, lightning, thunder, and all other forms of stormy atmospheric display. Now if we examine Indra and Vritra a little more closely we find ourselves in the presence of an ever recurring Hindu economic problem. The fate of millions of India's teeming population is dependent upon the coming of the rains. With rain there is plenty and happiness; with drought there is famine, pestilence, death. Such is the time- old drama of India's life. Out of it, in the olden days, grew the religion of Indra. On the one hand there were the nature forces-drought, rain, lightning, thunder-conditioning India's weal and woe; on the other hand was the vital ever recur- ring need of obtaining the beneficent rain and of escaping demonic drought. Brought together, these two factors produce the opposite "divinities" of Indra and Vritra, and all the "sanctities" connected with their service.</page><page sequence="14">RELIGION AND ANTHROPOLOGY 613 But while it is true that "divinities" are nature-forces, it is equally certain that they are humanistic also. Animism, as we have already seen, is the belief that nature is alive as man is alive; between it and him there is kinship. Consequently, primitive man's attitude toward nature-forces, as expressed in animism, is that they behave as he does, have thoughts and feelings as he has thoughts and feelings, and have organized forms of activity. Thus "spirits" of every variety must be dealt with as men deal one with another; they occupy definite localities and these localities may be organized and characterized after the manner of group organization. When spirits of the family, the clan, the tribe, emerge, they not merely exhibit in their relations among themselves the social organiza- tion of their particular groups but they also embody the ideals of their groups. This process is made especially clear through the development of anthropomorphic polytheism and mono- theism. In these forms of religion, the gods and the god are thought of, as to their natures, behavior, and relations, after the analogy of human nature, human life, and human social organization. The gods are male and female; there are grand- fathers and grandmothers among the gods, as well as fathers and mothers, sisters and brothers; their conduct toward one another and toward their devotees is patterned on human con- duct and is regulated by its standards. In the higher poly- theistic religions, and in ethical monotheism especially, the gods or god become the vehicles of man's advancing ideals. In the Hebrew-Christian religious development this is funda- mentally and peculiarly true. The god of Jesus is a thoroughly humanized god, and the religion of Jesus moves in the medium of an idealized social order. The gods and god-man's divinities-are, therefore, in every form of animistic religion the projection of man's ideals out from himself and into the cosmic order. This much we learn from Durkheim. In her volume entitled Themis Jane Harrison works out the interpretation in detail for the Greek god Zeus.</page><page sequence="15">614 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION So much for the animistic type of religion, but what about the naturistic religions ? In naturistic religions the personal element is held in abey- ance wherever it is recognized, and the evolution of this mode of religion has been toward the complete elimination of the personal. The control of naturistic divinities is by impersonal means, and the religious attitude is ever objective. None the less the attitude of the devotees of these religions is distinctly religious, and the "divinities" are essentially spiritual. The difference between Christianity and Vedantism, fundamental as it is, rests upon social conditions. Both interpret the cosmic factor in religion in humanistic terms, but to the one the essence of society rests in persons and in personal relations, whereas, to the other, persons are but the vehicles and temporary embodiments of an inherently objective and impersonal social order. To Christianity, persons in their human relations, are the centers of society and the agents of its progress; to Vedant- ism persons are but torches to pass on the flame of life; society, in its impersonal agencies and relations, is the all important fact. Thus, whereas to Christianity persons are inherently valuable, to Vedantism they are inherently valueless. Or to state the contrast otherwise: to the Christian the individual, in principle, is everthing and caste is nothing, while to the Hindu the individual is nothing and caste is everything. In the continuity of social institutions in India and in the extreme conservatism of its social life we thus find the clue to its type of spiritual life. Hindu, as well as Christian, regards God as the ultimate cosmic fact; the two differ in the type of human- ism which each projects into its cosmic beliefs, and this differ- ence, in essence, is dependent upon a difference in social situation. Should the social organizations of the world evei take on the rigid compartmental class distinctions of India, Vedantism would become the religion of the world; the fate of Christianity, on the other hand, is bound up with the success of militant, creative democracy. However, there is a further</page><page sequence="16">RELIGION AND ANTHROPOLOGY 615 possibility: should Vedantism and Christianity both fail through the breakdown of both personal and caste values, and should the life of man appear to be, both individually and socially, an essentially worthless thing-mere flotsam and jetsam on the cosmic tides-man's religion would inevitably conform to the type of the religion of Buddha. Of this possi- bility we possess an excellent illustration and suggestion in Bertrand Russell's The Free Man's Worship. To results such as these, it seems to me, the researches of anthropology directly lead, and they open up to view certain well-defined and ever recurring metaphysical problems which in closing we shall merely indicate. And after all, these prob- lems reduce themselves to one, viz., "What right, as intelligent men, have we to contend that the cosmos may properly be interpreted in humanistic terms, that it possesses in its essential being specifically human characteristics? Unless that ques- tion can be answered positively, then religion fails in its objec- tive, cosmic reference. However, in being forced to face this ultimate metaphysical inquiry, religion finds itself in very respectable company-that of science. While in no wise deny- ing the objectivity of science or the independent reality of the scientist's cosmos, one may insist that, after all, science is an ordered humanistic attack upon our vast cosmos. As a process science is an endeavor to read the heiroglyphics of nature, a process to which the clue is and the resultant inter- pretation may be essentially humanistic. In a word religion and science, equally, rest upon humanistic first principles in their objective cosmic references. But this is to say that religion and science are not in essence antagonistic: rather they stand or fall together, ultimately.</page></plain_text>
