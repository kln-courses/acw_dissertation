BRAUN of positions), located within settlements.2 In addition, a tradition of skull separation and treatment, common especially in the Early Neolithic and waning in the Late Neolithic period, completely disappeared with the onset of the Chalcolithic period.3 Extra-settlement interment apparently became the norm as the period progressed and formal cemeteries were introduced.4 New sepulchral arrangements included the quarrying or alteration of caves (specifically for burials) and a wide array of specialised constructions (e.g. dolmens, megalithic chambers, cists and circular stone constructions).5 In addition, stone and ceramic ossuaries became preferred receptacles for secondary burials, although the custom of utilising storage jars as repositories for infant burials continued.6 The development of diverse burial practices and structures hints at a significant shift in behaviour regarding death and possibly ideology. An additional concomitant component of this change is that, in contrast to the lack of grave goods characteristic of Late Neolithic burials,7 associated finds increase substantially during the subsequent Chalcolithic period.8 Significantly, a burst of artistic 2 A.

This paper deals with the morphological characteristics of this bowl type, its relationship to ground-stone assemblages, and contextual associations. It further suggests interpretations of the practical and symbolic significance of this type of bowl. Innovations in craft production in the southern Levant during the late fifth to mid fourth millennia B.C.E. strikingly contrast with the traditional methods of earlier periods. These innovations are evident in specialised ceramic vessel manufacture, ivory carving, sophisticated metallurgical skills in copper production and the fabrication of ground-stone artefacts, especially bowls.10 Ground-stone working in this period achieved a notable diversity and level of expertise only rarely exhibited at other times in the same region. It is exemplified by a diverse array of objects, such as schematic stylised human 'violin-shaped' figurines,11 basalt pillar figures 9 The extraordinary variety of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic painted and three dimensional decoration on these objects (e.g. Perrot and Ladiray [above, n. 5]; Z.

ROWAN AND E. BRAUN of the Golan12 and Gilead regions,13 as well as palettes, beads and mace heads,14 fashioned from different kinds of stone. Chalcolithic ground-stone assemblages typically reflect locally available materials, the most common types including limestone, chalk, conglomerate and basalt. Thus, in the northern regions of Israel and Jordan, where basalt was readily available, it was commonly used for the production of grinding slabs, hand stones, mortars and other types of ground-stone tools. However, in the northern Negev and the Mediterranean coastal plain, regions more remote from basalt sources (c. +100 km.), one rarely encounters these types of tools fashioned out of this material. Nevertheless, basalt bowls are virtually ubiquitous at Chalcolithic sites throughout the southern Levant, no matter how far from basalt sources. Thus, many basalt vessels associated with Chalcolithic sites were evidently imported. Major basalt flows are found in the Golan Heights, Galilee, Jebel Druze and along the eastern shore of the Dead Sea (Fig. 1). More limited basalt outcrops are found in the Carmel Range, at Makhtesh Ramon of the Negev Desert, and in a few small isolated areas further south.15 These smaller exposures, such as those at Makhtesh Ramon, the southern basaltic dykes and a small outcrop in the Jordan Valley (Ghor el-Katar), are eliminated as potential sources for Chalcolithic bowls on the grounds either of p?trographie dissimilarities or the diminutive size of the nodules available.16 Unfortunately, no workshops for the production of Chalcolithic basalt vessels have been discovered to date. While some basalt debris was recovered during excavations at Tell Abu Hamid, this was attributed to tool modification or vessel remodification, but no vessel workshop or large-scale production was suggested.17 12 C.

BRAUN In the absence of such evidence, our understanding of the production of these vessels and the mechanisms by which they were distributed remains incomplete. Therefore, the present study, which discusses one highly specialised bowl type and its relationship to the Chalcolithic basalt ground-stone industry, concentrates only on the typological aspects. The 'fenestrated and pedestalled' stand vessel,18 a variant of which is the subject of this paper, is often considered to be one of the hallmarks of the Chalcolithic culture.19 Its floruit is virtually limited to that period; the sole exception (of dubious chronological provenance) is purportedly dated to the Early Bronze Age I.20 The type discussed here first came to the notice of E.C.M. van den Brink during excavations at Shoham (North), on the eastern slope of Lod Valley21 A karstic system of four small caves (Area AI) was used for burial, as well as for domestic purposes, from Chalcolithic to Intermediate Bronze times. Each cave had its own sequence of occupation. Chalcolithic use included occupation and secondary burials in ceramic ossuaries (rectangular boxes and specialised jars). The caves were reused as habitations in the Early Bronze Age I, and two were reused in the Intermediate Bronze Age. The basalt artefacts discussed in this work all derive from Cave No. 4, the only place in Area Al that produced evidence of two successive Chalcolithic strata, a habitation level superimposed upon earlier burials. The artefacts were found among 69 fragments of basalt vessels, all dated to the Chalcolithic period.22 Initially puzzling were several fragments of 18 Amiran and Porat (above, . 15), p. 11. 19 T.E.

Subsequently, several parallels derived from other Chalcolithic contexts were recovered, corroborating the dating and reconstruction of these objects. Collectively, these fragments suggest the existence of a previously unknown variant of the typical fenestrated pedestalled bowl. The present study describes this new variant, relates all the examples from recent excavations that have come to the knowledge of the authors, and suggests interpretations based on their contexts. THE ORIGINS AND TYPOLOGY OF FENESTRATED PEDESTALLED BASALT BOWLS The fenestrated pedestalled basalt bowl of the Chalcolithic period has its antecedents in much earlier ground-stone traditions of the Levant. Basalt was a commonly chosen material for the production of vessels. The earliest examples of stone mortars ? of limestone, basalt and phosphorite23 ? are documented from Epipalaeolithic times.24 Pedestalled mortars and bowls first appear in the Natufian culture (e.g., Maliha),25 but remain relatively rare throughout the Late Natufian and the subsequent Early Neolithic periods (PPNA and PPNB).26 We suspect they may be more common in the subsequent Late Neolithic period, but unfortunately, it is impossible to ascertain their frequency, nor do we know their complete typological range. For a variety of reasons, few of these vessels are known from Late Neolithic contexts. The frequently deeply buried strata dating from the Late Neolithic often remain unexplored or of limited exposure; moreover, much of what has been excavated is insufficiently reported. However, this impression may change with increased knowledge of these periods. The earliest basalt bowls of this tradition have solid pedestals and apparently pre-date fenestrated examples. Examples from Yarmukian and other Late 23 Y.

VAN DEN BRINK, Y.M. ROWAN AND E. BRAUN Neolithic-Early Chalcolithic contexts are rare and only vaguely resemble Chalcolithic types, the only common feature being the pedestals.27 Notably, reports on levels and sites dated to the Wadi Rabah culture (the latest Neolithic or earliest Chalcolithic phase) include only a handful of illustrations of basalt bowls, suggesting a relative scarcity of these vessels in this cultural context.28 One was recovered at Tel Dan, from a context thought to represent a variant of the Wadi Rabah culture.29 This well-preserved vessel clearly differs, both in form and finish, from Chalcolithic pedestalled vessels; its bowl is convex in profile, while Chalcolithic types are usually straight walled. Less emphasis was placed on finely grinding the exterior of the Tel Dan vessel, and the basalt was neither as dense nor as finely grained as that commonly chosen for most Chalcolithic vessels. Nonetheless, the typical hour-glass silhouette, common to Chalcolithic pedestalled bowls, is already recognisable. Few other vessels of this type are illustrated or published. A slightly similar, incomplete pedestalled stand was recovered at Kfar Galim North; another is known from Kabri.30 Possibly the basalt vessels with pedestal bases most similar to the later Chalcolithic forms are two examples recovered from the upper levels of Tel cEli.31 Both have the wide flaring base common to the pedestal and a contracted medial section (where the bowl joins the pedestal). Examples from Chalcolithic sites also exhibit some parallels with the Tel Dan vessel. A number of fragments of basalt from Tell Abu Hamid appear to be portions of solid pedestals, while one may be a fragment of a hollow pedestal.32 In addition, 27 E.g., M.W.

An alternative explanation for the dearth of these vessels may lie in their state of preservation, perhaps so fragmentary that they were either overlooked or not deemed worthy of publication. Notably, in his primary discussion that identified the Wadi Rabah horizon, J. Kaplan neither discussed nor illustrated stone vessels (cEin el Jarba: Chalcolithic Remains in the Plain of Esdraelon, BASOR 194 [1969], pp. 2-39; The Wadi Rabah Culture: Twenty Years After, Museum Haaretz Bulletin 14 [1972], pp. 23-29). 29 A.

It is perhaps not a coincidence that these sites provide evidence for Late Neolithic/Early Chalcolithic occupations. These vessels suggest continuity of tradition between these cultural horizons. The simple open-form basalt bowl with flat base and straight wall (Type 1) is probably the more frequently recovered type among Chalcolithic basalt 33 T.E.

Levy (eds.): Archaeology, Anthropology, and Cult: The Sanctuary at Gilat, Leicester (in press). 34 This is an unusual material for vessels of this type. Notably, other vessels in the same publication, dated to the EB I, were also identified as serpentine by Mellaart, see A. Leonard, Jr.: The Jordan Valley Survey 1953: Some Unpublished Soundings Conducted by James Mellaart (The Annual of the American Schools of Oriental Research 50), Winona Lake, IN, 1992, PL 33:7,8, but most probably were of basalt. If not, phosphorite is more likely, see Goren (above, n. 23). 35 Leonard (above, n. 34), PL 5:29. 36 The fractures of this truncated fragment show evidence of intentional grinding, perhaps in secondary usage. This type of re-modification of medial fenestrated stand fragments is common, Rowan et al (above, . 33), Wright (above, n. 16), further attesting to the value ascribed to this material. 37 E. Braun: Yiftahel, in NEAEHL 4, pp. 1513-1515. 38 With the exception of the vessel fragment discussed, a fragment of a simple basalt bowl of Chalcolithic mien (straight walls with incised chevrons on the edge of rim interior) and a flint adze, there are no other objects that may be specifically associated with the Chalcolithic horizon, Braun (above, n. 27). 39 An attribution to the early EB I seems quite unlikely because of the dearth of such vessels in contemporary EB I contexts, Braun (above, n. 20), Fig. 4.3A.</page><page sequence="10">170 E.C.M. VAN DEN BRINK, Y.M. ROWAN AND E. BRAUN vessels,40 yet fenestrated pedestalled basalt vessels (Type 2) are also common. The relative distribution of these types is discussed elsewhere.41 Amiran and Porat distinguished between two types of Chalcolithic pedestalled basalt bowls:42 one, a bowl set upon a hollow 'foot' (pedestal) with cut-outs, is designated 'fenestrated' (here Type 2A), while in the other, a three-legged or four-legged stand crowns a circular ring base (Type 2B; for a detailed description, see below).43 Type 2A: Fenestrated Pedestalled Vessels (Fig. 2) There seems to be greater variability among Type 2A specimens than in Type 2B. The former, which are generally smaller than the latter, may be crudely to finely crafted, carefully and symmetrically fashioned or clumsily lopsided. This is most apparent when comparing openings ('windows') in the pedestals. While some 'windows' are well defined, with distinct edges, and are square to trapezoidal in form (Fig. 2), others are barely more than crude openings, their outlines only roughly approaching regular geometric shapes. Two examples from Gilat are finely fashioned, both externally and internally, with clearly defined sub-trapezoidal windows'.44 Some of the nearly complete Type 2A basalt vessels from Tuleilat Ghassul45 are similar to the Gilat bowls, primarily in their diminutive size, although they are less well finished. By virtue of their fenestrated hollow pedestals, all these examples represent variations on the same basic type (2A). Additional bowls of Fig. 2.

Further typological details may be found in Rowan (above, n. 10), where Type 2A bowls are designated Type 4Ci, and Type 2B vessels are designated Type 4Cii. 44 Alon and Levy (above, n. 11), Fig. 12.3; and Y.M.

Type 2A vessels exhibit more morphological variability than Type 2B specimens, but the most common decorative motifs of Type 2A may be seen as a variation on the same concept. The most common type of decoration is a single narrow (c. 7-12 mm. wide) band in relief around the medial section (Fig. 2), while some vessels exhibit two or more bands. One fragment from Gilat has at least four, and possibly five raised bands. Multiple raised bands are also found on vessels from Tuleilat Ghassul, Grar and Abu Hamid.47 Some bands are executed not in relief, but by shallow parallel incised lines. This technique is evident at several sites, including Shoham (North), Gilat and Tuleilat Ghassul,48 but does not seem very common. Apart from the bands around the medial area, there is little evidence for decoration on Type 2A vessels. Incised chevrons and related motifs are found on exterior leg fragments of a few fenestrated stands, but it is unclear whether they should be considered Type 2A or Type 2B vessels (for a discussion of this decoration type, see below). Type 2B: Bowls with Three- or Four-Legged Stands (Fig. 3) Type 2B bowls tend to be widely flaring and finely finished, and the supports of their pedestals are much thinner and more carefully worked than those of Type 2A. In cross-section, these supports vary between triangular, plano-convex, and almost square. Large open spaces between the supports suggest the appellation 'legs' for this type of support, rather than the 'walls' with cut-out windows, characteristic of Type 2A. The larger openings between supports also permitted greater ease of access, resulting in the more finely finished interiors of the pedestals. Type 2B vessels are supported by three or four legs, such as those from Abu Matar (note the unique narrow 'slits' carefully excised into the legs of this vessel) 46 Pella: A.

This variant ? Sub-type 2Bi ? is outstanding in the skill shown in its fabrication and the care taken in its finish. The examples described in this paper, the first to have been identified, are all from Shoham (North). An additional example is also known from excavations at Nahal Qanah Cave.57 Recent excavations at Peqfin and at the site of Givcat ha-Oranim have produced additional, slightly different variations (see below, Sub-type 2Bii).58 a. Four-legged pedestalled bowl with central support (Figs. 4,5). Four connecting fragments of this vessel, fashioned from dense vesicular basalt, were recovered. Three are portions of the legs and their juncture with a ring base. The leg fragments are triangular in cross-section, while the cross-section of the ring is roughly trapezoidal. The diameter of the ring base measures 180 mm. at its exterior and 150 mm. at its interior (measured from the bottom). The tallest preserved leg fragment, 160 mm. in height, has a 'stem' protruding and slanting slightly upward from its interior. The fourth fragment is roughly cylindrical in section. Although less well finished, it is manufactured from the same dense basalt (c. 37 mm. in diameter), with four thin cylindrical protuberances jutting from the base. When restored, it joins with the 'stem' fragment of one of the preserved legs to form a large continuous portion of a vessel. By extrapolation, the shape of the pedestal may be reconstructed in its entirety. It is clear that each of these protrusions from this fourth, roughly cylindrical fragment was originally connected to one of the four 'stems' protruding upward from the corresponding legs. It is also clear that the central cylindrical protuberance supported the centre of the bowl's base (see reconstruction, Fig. 5). Corroboration for this reconstruction comes from a basalt vessel fragment recovered from a Chalcolithic context at Nahal Qanah Cave (Fig. 6). The underside of this Type 2Bi bowl has four stubs (triangular in section and corresponding to four legs of a pedestal), surrounding one central cylindrical support.59 56 Their size recommends their attribution to Type 2A, but the narrowness of the supports, suggesting legs, and the fine grinding devoted to its finish suggest greater affinities to Type 2B vessels. For the present, we consider these to be examples that transcend the two distinct types. 57 Gopher and Tsuk (above, n. 10), p, 112, Fig. 4.16:3. 58 Peqfin: Gal et al. (above, . 9).

Sub-type 2Bii: Three- and Four-legged Pedestalled Bowls with Interconnected Legs (Figs. 8,9) a. Three-legged bowl. During recent archaeological investigations at Yehud, S. Cohen recovered an assemblage of Chalcolithic artefacts.60 It includes two almost completely preserved three-legged pedestalled basalt bowls, one of which is particularly germane to the present study. Although all three legs are broken and no fragments of the ring base were recovered, on the interior of each leg there is the remainder of a small horizontal (rather than upward slanting) protrusion (Fig. 8). In contrast to the three previously described vessels from Shoham (North) and Nahal Qanah Cave, the legs on the Yehud example appear to have been joined directly to each other at the centre of the pedestal with horizontal struts, rather than somewhere in its upper portion. There is no evidence for an additional central support on the underside of the bowl, similar to that found on the fragmentary vessel from Nahal Qanah Cave and extrapolated for the Shoham examples. This reconstruction is also supported by a comparison to bowls with central supports. 60 Work was undertaken at this site on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority, see E.C.M. van den Brink et al. : A Note on Archaeological Investigations and Some Chalcolithic Finds from Yehud, cAtiqot 39 (in press).</page><page sequence="17">PEDESTALLED BASALT BOWLS OF THE CHALCOLITHIC 177 Notably, the internal space between the legs is far more restricted on the Yehud vessel than on the other examples; thus, the Yehud vessel appears to be yet another minor variation of the Type 2 theme. b.

An accurate description of this artefact is to be included in the final report of the Peqicin excavations. Fig. 9. Sub-type 2Bii(b) from Peqfin: four-legged pedestalled basalt bowl with interconnected DISCUSSION In terms of overall dimensions, the three- and four-legged pedestalled vessels from Shoham (North) fit well into the category of Type 2B bowls. This is apparent from a comparison of the sizes of the vessels from the various site assemblages. For example, one of the largest assemblages of Type 2B vessels is from Nahal Qanah Cave, where the mean diameter of the ring base fragments is 265 mm. (n=14), ranging from 140 to 320 mm. Two ring bases from Abu Matar are 270 and 170 mm. in diameter. By contrast, mean ring base diameters of the fragments from Gilat are much smaller, with an average of c. 120 mm., ranging in size from 80 to 200 mm. in diameter.62 The Shoham (North) assemblage exhibits a mean ring base diameter of about 235 mm., ranging from 180 to 300 mm. These dimensions place the Shoham examples much closer in size to the Nahal Qanah Cave and Abu Matar assemblages than to the Gilat or Tuleilat Ghassul assemblages. Based on these sizes and the well-defined legs and finely-ground finish, all but one of the Shoham examples clearly belong to the Type 2B group, typified by the assemblages from Nahal Qanah Cave, Bir es-Safadi and Abu Matar. Decorative motifs associated with Type 2A vessels ? most notably the band(s) at the medial section ? appear on only one example from Shoham.63 61 Cf.

While in the past, it may have seemed that Type 2B bowls were found almost exclusively at the Beersheba Basin sites, this is no longer the case. The recent publication of the basalt vessels from the Nahal Qanah Cave reveals that they most closely resemble Type 2B pedestalled stands, both in size and morphology,64 most similar to those known from Abu Matar and Bir es-Safadi.65 It is less similar to Type 2A bowls from Gilat, Grar, Nahal Besor Site A, and some of the fragments recovered from Abu Hamid and Tuleilat Ghassul.66 Such morphological relationships may be suggestive of exchange patterns and may prove to be fruitful lines of inquiry as more data become available. Because some vessels fall in between these two types of fenestrated pedestalled stands in terms of size and morphological attributes,67 it is clear that there is some typological overlap. Nevertheless, it seems justifiable to divide these vessels into two fairly distinct types. Interpreting their significance, however, is extremely difficult. With the discovery of the Shoham (North) and Nahal Qanah Cave assemblages, the likelihood that these two types reflect boundaries of a regional nature seems less likely. Types 2A and 2B may actually represent chronological differences,68 although at some sites examples of both types seem to occur, possibly coeval with each other. For instance, at Bir es-Safadi, the majority of the pedestalled stands are of Type 2B, yet one small medial fragment with a band in relief belongs to a Type 2A vessel.69 Similarly, both types occur at Shoham (North). In addition, the majority of the basalt vessels from Tuleilat Ghassul are of Type 2 A, yet one vessel from that site (noted above) falls in between Types 2A and 2B, while others are of Type 2B, albeit diminutive in size.70 The coexistence of both types at these sites suggests that we still possess insufficient evidence to determine chronological divisions with any certainty. Regional patterns seem to suggest that the distribution of the two types, although not quantitatively equitable, was widespread throughout the study area. The exceptions to this seem to be the newly discovered sub-types, 2Bi and 2Bii, which so far have all been found in the central 64 Gopher (above, . 10). 65 J.

However, the discovery of a similar variant at Peqfin could extend the regional range of this sub-type significantly. As an alternative, we might hypothesise that the two major types of fenestrated pedestalled basalt bowls reflect origins in different workshops. Such a suggestion does not preclude the possibility of some aspects of regionality, as well as chronological associations for each of the two types. For instance, the highly skilled workmanship evident in the manufacture of the Shoham sub-variant exhibits little in common with the manufacture exemplified by some of the poorer examples of Type 2A vessels. Within the Type 2A group as well, there is a clear dichotomy in the level of workmanship between well-made vessels (e.g. from Gilat) and poorly finished vessels (e.g. from Tuleilat Ghassul). It is possible that the latter group represents individual efforts to copy the superior production of skilled craftsmen. There are several reasons to suggest that basalt vessels represent prestige objects, as noted by Philip and Williams-Thorpe.71 Not only is basalt heavy and probably difficult to transport over any significant distance, but it is a difficult material to work. Creating elaborate and intricate objects probably required a combination of flaking, drilling, grinding and smoothing, presumably using stone tools. The amount of labour required to make one vessel is hard to estimate, but recent ethnographic observations by Hayden provide some insight into the matter.72 Following and recording all aspects of a traditional Guatemalan metate (grinding slab) manufacturer, Hayden's study highlights the experience required to create tools, select blanks and manufacture artefacts from basalt. It also indicates that the experienced metate maker, working in basalt and primarily using stone tools, requires at least two and a half days (14 hours) to fully complete a simple grinding slab with three small protrusions ('feet').73 This does not include transportation time, or the time required to manufacture and re-sharpen tools. According to the metate manufacturer, the time required must have been considerably greater in the past, and in general, the modification of basalt for vessel manufacture would have been more difficult than for metate manufacture, because basalt of a higher density would have been desirable for this purpose. We can assume that the much more intricately worked and highly finished vessels required considerably more time than the production of a well-made grinding slab. In addition, Hayden notes that the metate manufacturer had specialised knowledge about how to select the basalt cobbles without internal flaws and with the most appropriate density for his needs.74 This would be expected for 71 Philip and Williams-Thorpe (above, . 15), p. 51. 72 .

Variations of Type 1 basalt vessels are frequently found at occupation sites of the Chalcolithic period and the Early Bronze Age I.75 Their absence in many burial contexts would seem to suggest that these objects were primarily utilitarian and only rarely related to ritual practices. For instance, they are absent at burial sites such as Bene Beraq, Kissufim and Nahal Mishmar. However, there are burial and other contexts from which basalt vessels of both Types 1 and 2 were recovered, strongly suggesting associations with deposits resulting from mortuary or ritual behaviour. At occupation sites such as Abu Matar and Bir es-Safadi, basalt vessels were found in caches, particularly some associated with subterranean features and ivories.76 Basalt vessels, many of them Type 2, are also now known to be associated with burial sites, including Nahal Qanah, Bab edh-Dhrac, Peqfin Cave, Shoham (North), Palmahim Quarry, Azor and Givcat ha-Oranim.77 Notably, this tradition continues into the Early Bronze Age I. Large quantities of basalt bowls (derived from Chalcolithic Type 1 prototypes) are common in tombs of the early part of the period. They have been found in EB I cemeteries in Wadi Farcah, in Nahal Tabor, the Jezreel and Beth Shean Valleys, and at Bab edh-Dhrac and Ghor es-Safi.78 With a single possible exception from Megiddo,79 Type 2 vessels do not continue into the Early Bronze Age I. The association of these basalt types with mortuary practices in the Chalcolithic period is intriguing. So-called 'incense burners' (i.e., fenestrated pedestalled bowls) in pottery are often grave goods (e.g. Azor and Ben Shemen).80 They also appear in other ritual (e.g. Gilat and Shiqmim) and non-ritual contexts in the 75 Amiran and Porat (above, n. 15); Braun (above, n. 20); Gilead (above, n. 47). 76 Commenge (above, n. 46); Perrot (above, n. 49); idem (above, n. 65). 77 Nahal Qanah Cave: Gopher et al.

VAN DEN BRINK, Y.M. ROWAN AND E. BRAUN Chalcolithic period.81 However, the association of basalt pedestalled bowls with mortuary practices is a newly encountered phenomenon. This may in part be the result of more intensive investigations, especially in the central Shephelah and Galilee, where recent discoveries have been made. Whatever the reason, the association between these types of fenestrated vessels in basalt and highly ritualised contexts is greatly strengthened by the discovery of these new more elaborate forms of Type 2B. As discussed above, there are a number of reasons to regard the Type 2B basalt vessels, if not all basalt fenestrated stands, as objects carrying some prestige or status value. The discovery of this new variant in mortuary contexts suggests that these vessels, whether or not they served any utilitarian purpose, also had some more symbolic cultural meaning. These diverse contextual associations allude to the possibility of multiple functions82 and suggest that they may be viewed as dominant symbols with 'multivocality';83 that is, having a spectrum of referents, with different meanings becoming paramount at different times. It is particularly tempting, based on their non-utilitarian design,84 to propose the pedestalled bowls as one of the important symbols of the Chalcolithic culture. If one accepts that the object under the arm of the 'Gilat Lady'85 resembles the fenestrated stands,86 this lends further credence to this interpretation. In the absence of additional knowledge about the social context(s) in which they operated,87 their symbolism remains obscure. However, the frequent repetition of this form, in ceramic and basalt, associated with mortuary areas, underscores the centrality this form played in the lives of the Chalcolithic population. This suggests that these probably served as the type of symbols referred to by Turner as ideological or normative symbols,88 incorporating 81 Ritual contexts: Alon and Levy (above, . 11); T.E.

We are not the first to observe the association of this form with mortuary and other 'ritualised' contexts,89 but the recognition of new more elaborate and labour-intensive types with mortuary contexts highlights the important role played by these prestige artefacts in mortuary rituals. Given the variety of archaeological contexts from which pedestalled bowls are recovered, different symbolic functions seem probable. This would not be surprising, because most symbols are not static or association-free, but evoke meaning according to their context, other symbols, and the ritualised behaviours in which they are integral factors.90 It seems unlikely, therefore, that we can determine an abstract 'universal' symbolic code for the basalt vessels without knowing the contextual practice in which they were incorporated.91 However, repeated patterning from new discoveries may yet provide clues as to how these operated in a social context. Although we are not yet able to infer the overall 'meaning' of these artefacts, we are developing a better understanding of the artefacts and their cultural significance to the inhabitants of the southern Levant in late prehistory. 89 Epstein, (above, . 12,1975); lian (above, . 86). 90 Ortner (above, . 87); Turner (above, . 83). 91 M.
