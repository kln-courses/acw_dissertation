Stuctures Hawtal Whiting Group This paper discusses the transfer of engineering analytical technology between the automobile and aerospace industries. The role of predictive analysis within both industries is addressed, with a particular emphasis on secondary safety. The use of non linear computer analysis techniques is discussed with particular reference to an accident involving a Boeing 7 37- 400 in the UK in 1 989 . The accident resulted in the author's organisation performing correlated injury studies by occupant kinematic analysis, which are described in outline. INTRODUCTION This paper reviews specific areas where 'cross fertilisation' between the automobile and aerospace industries might take place, and indeed has taken place. The author's background is primarily that of a European perspective, having the experience of servicing automobile and aerospace clients for a United Kingdom consultancy organisation. In the UK in 1 988 the major engineering combine, British Aerospace, absorbed the automobile maker Rover Group. As it happened this takeover had many controversial aspects, centering on the competitive and financial factors of the deal. This has now obscured the initial comment from financial analysts regarding the synergy between the respective technical bases of the two organisations. Perhaps the relationship has similar aspects to that of Hughes and GM in the USA. In fact the financial commentators on the UK's Rover deal failed to see significant synergy at the working level's of the organisations. Conversely, most engineers will be aware of areas of similarity and Rover/BAe do seem to be making the most of their opportunities as scans of new appointments reveal. Many engineers will be aware of some transfer of technology between aerospace and automotive. Often this has occurred, not by means of strategic planning, as in the examples above, but because certain individuals made a career move. A lack of planning in this regard does not mean it is ineffective, indeed the transplant of techniques by the practitioner is probably the most direct method. Mergers and deals may result in a more formalised exchange. Thirdly many vendors supply both to Aerospace and Automotive customers. Before considering the simi- larities of the two industries it is useful to consider the differ- ences. The economics of production is the most prominent difference. An auto engineer coming across a part machined from solid, reacts with near 327</page><page sequence="2">hysteria. Such a process is almost unheard of for any volume production vehicle. Likewise the lack of stamped parts in most aircraft is a quid pro quo. Boeing's "mass" pro- duction of two or three a week contrasts very markedly with GM' s 10000 a week or more. It would be foolish to minimise the significance of such numbers . Quality control (QC) is another area of considerable divergence , and is driven by the needs of the product. When this is combined with economic factors relating to production volumes , QC procedures are quite different. Auto applications tend to rely heavily on Statistical Process Control (SPC) and other audit methods , whereas 100% in- spection is common for aerospace parts . The issue of quality control leads directly to safety considera- tions , where there is a differ- ence of emphasis , although it can be argued a similar commitment. Primary safety is a total philos- ophy for aircraft, whereas until recently an aircrash tended to be considered almost non survivable. Automobiles on the other hand controlled by the amateur operator on the relative chaos of public roads, are engineered with many secondary safety features. The accident statistics generally support such a difference in approach. Despite the formidable and mostly production orientated differ- ences identified above, automobiles and aircraft are both vehicles. They both contain passengers in a structure manufactured from thin wall materials. Weight and cost are important for both. They require to move through the environment as efficiently as possible. Safety considerations are important for both. Multiple products are made from one design, unlike a bridge or a building. SYNERGY IN ANALYSIS Many would perceive that aero- nautical engineering has much so- phisticated technology to offer automobile design. At first glance there would seem to be little scope for transfer in the reverse direction, but many problems offer much more challenge to the automobile engineer. Computational Fluid Dynamics ( CFD ) is a difficult prospect for vehicle engineers because of bluff body effects. Vehicle structure durability is dependent on world wide road surfaces, making road load data (RLD) collection an area where much sophistication is needed. Perhaps the automobile engineer is pre-emi- nent in the technologies of crashwor- thiness. Here there are major oppor- tunities for the benefit of the aircraft industry, as survivability issues become more important to aircraft manufacturers. Until re- cently, the philosophical blinkering to the consequence of a crash was evident in aircraft design. Two years ago the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) introduced crash rules for aircraft seats and cabins, closely based on passenger car expe- rience. As mentioned earlier the automo- bile industry is very experienced in management of secondary safety, and my own organisation was in- strumental in applying this technol- ogy to an aerospace application. Although pioneered in the aerospace sector, the use of Finite Element analysis is widespread throughout all industry. The automobile engineer has made good use of these techniques for crash- worthiness by the application of iterative nonlinear analysis. Often these models are complex, large degree of freedom (DoF) models solved by using explicit codes. The problem with these techniques is that they require detailed modelling. Skilfully used beam element models using localised substructuring tech- niques can be used while a design evolves, and thereby be used to influence the crashworthiness at the concept stage. The author's organi- sation uses both techniques. The important observation here is that the auto industry uses these techniques to optimise crash- worthiness designs whilst minimising crash tests. A full vehicle crash 328</page><page sequence="3">test is an expensive and time con- suming process. It is obvious that the need to rely on analytical techniques as a tool is even more important for the aircraft industry, if secondary safety is to be de- veloped. Ultimately the crashworthiness performance of the automobile is not judged by the product itself, but by its effect on the occupants. It is therefore necessary to be able to predict occupant injury criteria. This will be illustrated by a description of the applica- tion of the techniques, not to a prospective vehicle design, but to an actual aircraft accident. HW Structures (1) has made extensive use of a mathematical dynamics modelling program, MADYMO (2) in predicting injury levels sustained in vehicle impacts. The program comprises two and three dimensional versions which represent the variety of Anthropomorphic Test Dummies available. The analytical datasets have been verified by exten- sive testing. The human being is represented mathematically by considering the body as a system of elements linked by joints. The motion of the systems is calculated for individual ele- ments, using the Lagrange technique. Each system comprises of a linkage of elements connected by nonlinear springs and dampers. The surface shapes may be defined as ellipses, ellipsoids, hyperellipsoids or planes. Using the elements available the engineer is able to define the surface interactions with the dummy, the restraint systems and vehicle environment. Modelling usually requires the geometry and stiffness of the seats, restraint systems, and belt anchorage locations to be specified. Stiff- nesses may be derived using force- deflection characteristics from test. Where design parameters are at the concept stage hand calculations and engineering judgement are required. Nonlinear finite element methods are also used to define the stiffness characteristics . The criteria used to assess the injury tolerance are defined in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Stand- ards. These form the basis for assessing the degree of injury sever- ity which is sustained by the occu- pants. Principally, the injury criteria pertain to head, thorax, and femur . The example of an automotive analysis shown in Fig 1 highlights the complexity of the type of impact which may be simulated. The analysis shows three seated 50% ile Hybrid II datasets with a standing three year old dummy, with the rear occupant being unbelted. The kinematics demonstrate the motion described by the occupants. Contact forces between the dummies and the interior environment may then be recovered. Not only does this model show the interaction of the child dummy, but we can see that the rear occupant has made the seatback fail and caused the front occupant to impact more severe- ly against the steering wheel. THE KEGWORTH AIRCRASH On 8 January 1989 a Boeing 737- 400 crash landed near Kegworth in England. Of 126 passengers on board 79 survived the accident. An analysis of the behaviour of the occupants during the accident was considered important to maximise the knowledge to be gained for surviva- bility issues. The objective was the collection of data about the survivors and the deceased, to corre- late the injuries sustained with the mechanical forces of the aircraft impact. The Kegworth analysis consisted of a computer simulation of the motion, acceleration and force histo- ries sustained by the occupants. These have been correlated with injury data. The analysis has been restricted to those seat positions where the seats were retained in the aircraft. Where catastrophic fail- ure of the fuselage and floor has occurred, there has been a loss of survival space and a further under- standing of the detailed mechanisms involved would be irrelevant. The aircraft sustained an impact 329</page><page sequence="4">lasting 2.2 seconds. This commenced with the initial tail skid impact on the east side of the motorway , until the aircraft came to rest in three sections , on the embankment on the west side. The crash pulse was supplied by the United Kingdom Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) . This was used to provide the force input to the model. A single occupant , from whom a fairly comprehensive set of data was known, was selected. This was to permit a correlation study to be made. The occupant chosen for the correlation was seated in row 15, directly behind the emergency exit over the wing. The occupant assumed a brace position prior to the crash with the forearms vertically between the head and the facing seat back. This was simulated by a Hybrid III dummy dataset. The simulation comprises two seat rows. The front seat holds a second, supplementary, 50th percen- tile occupant. This is for the purpose of creating the correct response and contact environment for the primary occupant. In front of the second occupant a bulkhead was mo- delled to provide an additional restraint and reduce the occupant's forward translation. Studies using a sister aircraft were used to determine a probable brace position of the occupants. This was supplemented by the anecdo- tal evidence of the survivors. From the simulation it was discovered that the forehead of the simulated occupant hit the table of the seat in front. Head Injury Criteria (HIC) of just under 300 have been predicted, thus facial lacera- tions would be expected although it is unlikely that serious head injury would occur. In the accident, the site of head contact can be clearly identi- fied by witness marks on the seat back and confirms the analysis. This is followed by head strike against the lower end of the seatback. Additionally the levels of facial injury are also as expected. The occupant did not lose consciousness. This is commensurate with a head injury criterion of about 300. Correlation between injuries sus- tained and the loads on the pelvis was also good. It is encouraging that such good correlation has been achieved. This may be a finding that provides feedback to automotive safety research. Here we have a real world accident which demonstrated the replication of human behaviour with anthropomorhpic dummies, albeit represented by analytical datasets. Many of the passengers in the aircraft did not assume a brace position, and remained seated up- right. It was decided to examine the kinematics and injury levels sus- tained by these occupants. Unlike the situation for the braced, where a single, well docu- mented occupant was selected for correlation purposes, an equivalent upright occupant could not be identi- fied for close study. Nonetheless several similar occupants were exam- ined in a more general way. The predicted injury levels which were obtained from the simula- tion were found to be consistent with injuries sustained by the survivors. Head injury criteria are consistent with concussion. Contacts represen- tative of pelvic and lower limb injuries are well predicted. Medical records of the NLDB (3) team show that there was an increased incidence of unconsciousness due to concussion for those passengers who assumed an upright position. A significant number of passengers displayed injuries consistent with the contacts predicted by the analy- sis. A comparison of the upright occupant simulation with the brace position shows considerable differ- ences in results. Significantly higher HIC, thorax, femur and pelvis injury levels are obtained. The kinematic plots indicate a higher degree of penetration of the occupant into the facing seat back with in- creased head, and chest accelera- tions. These are attributed to the increased relative velocity of the upper body before striking the facing 330</page><page sequence="5">seat back. Severe rotation of the knee and foot joints are also appar- ent. The simulation was extended into a parametric study , to examine the brace and upright positions in de- tail. A summary of the results are presented in the Table. CONCLUSIONS The work, detailed in this paper, demonstrates that it is possi- ble to correlate the crash victim simulation of the occupant kinematics of on air crash with sustained in- juries. The predicted kinematics can show the mechanism of injury. In this case the simulation was extended into a parametric study to provide recommendations for greater surviva- bility in future accidents. The major value of this study is to show for the first time, that a definitive estimation of occupant kinematics and the effects on the victim, is possible for an aircrash. Working closely with the medical community, issues such as cabin debris, seat design and the general 'friendliness1 of the cabin have been highlighted. The use of crash testing to predict aircraft accidents is costly and time consuming, particularly in accident investigation. The degree of pitch and roll is not readily reproduceable. Such parameters are easily investigated using computer simulations. A complete analysis of the results of the Kegworth study is not presented here, and may be obtained elsewhere (4). Briefly these reflect the advantages to be gained from the initial positioning of a passenger before the impact. A brace position, similar to that illustrated (Figure 2) should be used for occupants exposed to aircraft accidents. It should be noted from this figure that the lower limbs are inclined slightly backwards, to reduce foot and lower leg injuries. An upright or semi- braced position should not be used. Also some findings were made regard- ing seat and seat belt systems. The analysis of a three point belt system predicted a reduction in femur and belt loads. A reduction in HIC and femoral loads were predicted for a rearward facing seat. The Kegworth aircrash analysis has produced some important conclu- sions for engineers in regard to synergy. It has been demonstrated that the application of occupant kinematic analysis, developed for the auto industry, can be used to assess aircrash victims. The validity of the technique has been directly compared with injuries, rather than anthropomorphic dummies. Other nonlinear analysis techniques developed for primary applications in the auto industry may find applica- tions in the aerospace industry. 331</page><page sequence="6">REFERENCES 1.
