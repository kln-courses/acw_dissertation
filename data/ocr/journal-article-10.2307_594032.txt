<plain_text><page sequence="1">DOMINANT IDEAS IN THE FORMATION OF CHINESE CULTURE * DERK BODDE UNIVESITY OF PENNSYLVANIA Innumerable difficulties beset the man daring enough to attempt a subject such as this, quite aside from the obvious ones of facile generalization and limitations of space. Should we, for example, consider as " dominant ideas " those that have been expressed by the relatively small group of articulate Chinese known to us through literature, or should the heterogeneous and often contradictory beliefs held by the anonymous masses also be included? And if the latter, how are we to evaluate their im- portance as compared with those of the minority? In reply, I can merely say that I shall attempt to present as " dominant " only those concepts that I feel have had genuine importance for a very large number of Chinese, both literate and illiterate; that go far back into the roots of Chinese civiliza- tion and are presumably truly Chinese in origin; and that at the same time have continued over long epochs to exert a powerful influence in Chinese thought, in many cases unto the present day. This last criterion means that we shall be forced to dis- regard certain very early and in themselves interest- ing concepts (such as some of the magical beliefs current during the Shang dynasty, 1766 ?-1123? B. C.), simply because, important as they were in their own age, they either disappeared or became greatly changed by the time Chinese civilization assumed a well defined pattern or norm. As a convenient method of procedure I propose to treat our subject under three heads: (1) the basic concepts of the Chinese as regards the world of the supernatural; (2) as regards the world of nature; and (3) as regards the world of man. In other words, what has been the prevailing Chinese attitude toward religion, toward the physical uni- verse, and toward themselves? Adoption of such a division will give us a convenient framework with- in which to move, even though we must recognize that some ideas cannot be readily confined to any one of these three categories, while others may con- ceivably escape the bounds of all of them together. 1. THE WORLD OF THE SUPERNATURAL The first observation to be made here is a nega- tive one. It is that the Chinese, generally speaking, have been less concerned with this world than with the other worlds of nature and of man. They are not a people for whom religious ideas and activities constitute an all important and absorbing part of life; and this despite the fact that there are, nomi- nally, more Buddhists in China to-day than in any other country of the world. The significant point, in this connection, is that Buddhism came to China from the outside, and that before its impact in the first century A. D., China itself produced no thinker, with the doubtful exception of the philosopher, Mo Tzui (ca. 479-ca. 381 B. C.), who could be classed as a religious leader. It is ethics (especially Con- fucian ethics), and not religion (at least, not re- ligion of a formal organized type), that has pro- vided the spiritual basis of Chinese civilization.' The prevailing attitude of sophisticated Chinese toward the supernatural is perhaps best summed up by Confucius himself (551-479 B. C.), who once when asked by a disciple about the meaning of death, replied: " Not yet understanding life, how can you understand death? Am 2 Later thinkers have generally tended to adopt a skeptical attitude to- ward the unknown, and most of them, when they have ventured to express themselves on the subject, have even gone to pains to deny that there can be such a thing as a personal immortality.3 All of * Paper presented April 8, 1942, at the Centennial meeting of the AOS held in Boston. 1 This does not mean that there have not been periods of intense religious activity in Chinese history; during some five hundred years, from the fourth through the eighth century, many of China's best minds went into Buddhism. Nor does it mean that the Chinese masses have ever been free from a huge accumulation of super- stitious belief of all kinds; China is one of the richest storehouses in the world for the folklorist. Nevertheless, I still believe the statement to be true, generally speak- ing, that religion, as such, has been taken more lightly in China than in most other countries. Also it is certainly significant that Confucianism, despite periods of tem- porary eclipse, has for the last eight hundred years succeeded in retaining its dominance at the expense of both Buddhism and religious Taoism. 2 Analects, XI, 11. 8 On this point, which has not been clearly stated before, see my article, " The Chinese View of Immortality: its Expression by Chu Hsi and its Relationship to Buddhist Thought," Review of Religion 6. 4 (May, 1942), 369-83. It must be remembered in this connection that this was the view expressed only by a sophisticated minority. The great majority of the masses in China, as elsewhere, held a contrary opinion. 293</page><page sequence="2">294 BODDE: Dominant Ideas in the Formation of Chinese Culture which, of course, marks a difference of fundamental importance between China and most other major civilizations, in which a church and a priesthood have played a dominant role. The preceding remarks do not mean, of course, that before the coming of Buddhism there were no religious manifestations in ancient China. What is important, however, is the fact that, from the very beginnings of Chinese history, the most vital and sincere form of religious feeling has been expressed in the worship of departed ancestors.4 And this has been of decisive importance, for ancestor wor- ship, through its very nature, was a form of religion that could appeal to and be performed by only the immediate individual family groups concerned. Therefore it could not develop into a national or international organized faith similar to Christianity or other world religions. Side by side with this ancestral cult, to be sure, various objects and forces of nature were also wor- shipped, such as sacred mountains, rivers, and the life-giving soil. These, however, were generally conceived of in abstract rather than personified terms, and even the supreme Chinese divinity, T'ien i or Heaven, very rapidly lost its anthropomorphic qualities and became for most people a purely abstract ethical power. There was, therefore, nc elaborate pantheon or mythology in ancient China.' Likewise, there was no priesthood, because the wor- ship of these divine forces was performed, not by the common people or by a priestly class, but almost entirely by the ruler himself, who, as the " Son ol Heaven," acted as a sort of intermediary between the world of the supernatural and the world of man, Thus a pantheon, a mythology, or a priesthood are all comparatively late phenomena in China, con- nected either with Buddhism, or with the religious and popularized form of Taoism which developed,. in part, as a Chinese imitation of the formal aspects of Buddhism. It is true that the innumerable divinities ol Buddhism and Taoism have in later times found a ready welcome among the Chinese masses, but this testifies more to the highly eclectic nature of the Chinese mind than to any strongly religious feeling. Because of this eclecticism the Chinese have, like the Hindus, for the most part been remarkably free from religious bigotry. The few persecutions that have occurred have usually been directed, not against religious ideas, but against religion as a social and political institution that might threaten the security of the secular state. Finally, another fundamental difference between China and the civilizations of the Near East and of India, is the fact that in early China there was no idea of any kind of divine retribution after death. The whole concept of a system of rewards and punishments, meted out in a heaven or hell during a life hereafter, is utterly alien to Chinese thought and appears in China only with Buddhism.6 2. THE WORLD OF NATURE If the supernatural world has held a lesser place in China than in most other civilizations, quite the reverse is true of the second of our three categories, the world of nature. For the Chinese, this world of nature, with its mountains, its forests, its storms, its mists, has been no mere picturesque backdrop against which to stage human events. On the con- trary, the world of man and the world of nature constitute one great indivisible unity. Man is not the supremely important creature he seems to us in the western world; he is but a part, though a vital part, of the universe as a whole. This feeling conceivably may have originally sprung out of the overwhelmingly agrarian nature of Chinese civili- zation, and its consequent utter dependence, for survival itself, upon the continued regular succes- sion of the forces of nature. Be that as it may, it is a feeling which has come to permeate a very large part of Chinese philosophy, art and literature. In Taoism, the philosophy which has best ex- 4This, of course, contradicts the denial of a personal immortality, discussed above. But see the preceding note. 5 This, like all sweeping statements, is not absolutely true. Hints of a mythology can be found in early Chinese literature, but it is significant that they have been largely obliterated through the process of euhemerization. Cf. Henri Maspero, " Les legends mythologiques dans le Chou King," Jowrnal asiatique 214 (1924), 1-100. 6 The early Chinese did believe in a celestial realm known as T'ien, or Heaven, and a nether world region known as the Yellow Springs (huang ch'ilan A but they apparently conceived of them only in the vaguest terms, and certainly never as abodes of the blest and the damned, respectively. According to various texts, each human being was supposed to have two souls: the p'o 0 or anima, produced at the time of conception, and the hun or animus, which was joined to the p'o at the moment of birth. After death the hun ascended to Heaven, while the p'o remained in the tomb with the corpse for three years, after which it descended to the " Yellow Springs." Cf. Maspero, La Chine antique (Paris, 1927), 176-9, 182-3.</page><page sequence="3">BODDE: Dominant Ideas in the Formation of Chinese Culture 295 pressed this mystic awareness of the oneness of the universe, we find many striking anticipations of the ideas that were propounded in the West by Rousseau some two thousand years later. Like Rousseau, the Chinese Taoists said that human moral standards are artificial and hence invalid; that the appurtenances of civilization are corrupt- ing; and that therefore we must cast off these man- made trammels and return to the state of nature. Yet Taoist naturalism fundamentally differs from occidental romanticism, despite certain remarkable superficial resemblances. In the first place, it avoided the latter's sentimentality, emotional ex- cess, and emphasis upon love between man and woman. In the second place, romanticism has coun- tenanced the breaking of moral restraints in the name of spontaneity and originality. Taoism also did away with human moral standards, but re- placed them by a higher standard, that of the Tao A; or Way, the first cosmic principle of the universe which gives the Taoist school its name Man, said the Taoists, must subordinate himself to the Tao, that is, to nature. This is not to be done by a facile giving in to one's emotions, but by a process of self discipline (through meditation and other means) that will result in a lessening of the desires and a consequent feeling of calm content amidst the simplicities of the natural life. In the final stage the Taoist devotee aims at entering a state of union with the surrounding universe, in which he is so completely freed from the bonds of human emotions that neither joy nor sorrow, life nor death, longer affect him. In this respect, Taoism remains in accord with the general stream of oriental mysticism. This Taoist subordination of the self to the uni- verse also differs importantly from another current of modern occidental thought. In the West happi- ness is to be found by harnessing the forces of nature to the will of man and thus increasing the means for man's material enjoyment. In China, on the contrary, the sage traditionally has been one who accords himself to the universe as he finds it, and thus gains what he considers to be the true happiness of contentment in simplicity. This con- cept, widely accepted in China, goes far to explain why Chinese, both educated and illiterate, can re- main cheerful and even happy under poverty and primitive conditions that to a westerner would be intolerable. It has also been an important reason why the Chinese, though they developed remarkably scientific techniques in the compilation of their dic- dictionaries, histories, encyclopaedias, and other scholarly works, failed to apply these techniques to the world of nature, and so failed to create a physi- cal science.7 Yet this prevailing attitude toward the physical universe-an attitude perhaps best summed up in Wordsworth's phrase as a " wise passiveness "- has not prevented the Chinese from attempting to classify and systematize the natural phenomena which they observed. In simplest terms, the Chinese theory of cosmogony (expressed, of course, with in- finite variations by different writers) may be sum- marized as follows: Lying behind the physical universe as we see it there exists an impersonal first cause or prime mover, known as the Tao or Way, from which all being has been evolved. This Tao manifests itself in the form of two all-inclusive principles: the yang A, which is the principle of activity, heat, light, dryness, hardness, masculinity; and the yin j-, which is the principle of quiescence, cold, darkness, humidity, softness, femininity. Through the eternal interplay and interaction of these two principles, the five primary elements come into existence, these being fire (which is the essence of yang), water (which is the essence of yin), and earth, wood, and metal (which are combinations in varying degrees of the yang and the yin). These elements in their turn combine and recombine to produce all things in the universe, including Heaven (the sky, at- mosphere, stars, etc.), which is preponderantly yang, and the Earth (the soil, plants, animals, etc.), which is preponderantly yin. Everything in the universe thus pertains to one or another of the five elements, and the Chinese have compiled long lists of categories in fives, such as the five colors, five smells, five tastes, five tones, five internal organs, etc., with which to correlate the five elements.8 This splitting up of the world into sets of fives is a typical manifestation of the rationalistic Chi- nese mind, which tries to find order and plan in all things, and which has therefore taken a particular delight in inventing numerical categories of all 7 Cf. Bodde, "The Attitude toward Science and Scien- tific Method in Ancient China," T'ien Hsia Monthly 2. 2 (Feb., 1936), 139-60; also Fung Yu-lan, "Why China Has No Science," International Journal of Ethics 32. 3 (April, 1922), 237-63. 8 For a table showing a few of these correspondences, see Alfred Forke, The World-Conception of the Chinese (London, 1925), 240-1.</page><page sequence="4">296 BODDE: Dominant Ideas in the Formation of Chinese Culture kinds, not only in fives, but in many other num- bers.9 The theory of the yin and yang, the five elements, and their correlates, has for more than two thousand years been the basis for Chinese medi- cine, alchemy, astronomy, and naturalistic specu- lation generally. While it represents a very real attempt at the use of a scientific method, it un- fortunately has not led to a true physical science, because, being based upon arbitrary, man-made analogies, it disregarded the all important necessity of using an empirical method of direct observation of nature. In connection with this theory of cosmogony, it is important that we should distinguish clearly between the Chinese dualistic system based upon the interplay of the yin and yang principles, and the superficially similar dualisms of light and dark- ness, good and evil, etc., with which we are familiar in the Near East and in the occidental world. The latter dualisms are all based upon the concept of mutual antagonism between their two conflicting members; of the goodness of the one and the evil- ness of the other; and of the consequent necessity to conquer the evil so that the good may eventually triumph. They are often closely connected with religion. The yin-yang dualism, on the contrary, is based, not upon mutual opposition, but upon mutual har- mony. The feminine yin and the masculine yang are equally essential if there is to exist a universe. Each is complementary to the other, and neither is necessarily superior or inferior from a moral point of view. In this concept we see a striking mani- festation of the Chinese tendency, already alluded to, to find in all things an underlying harmony and unity, rather than struggle and chaos. In it, the Chinese would seem to have come closer to the ideas lying behind much of modern science, than have we in the West with our traditional good-versus-evil type of dualism. 3. THE WORLD OF MAN When we turn to the third of our three cate- gories, that of the world of man, we find ourselves at the heart of the greater part of Chinese philo- sophical speculation. How to get along equably with one's fellow men: this is the problem that Confucianism set itself to answer, just as Taoism posed for itself the problem of how man can adjust himself to the outer universe. The Chinese, with sound common sense, have from very early times realized that unless there can be a solution to this central problem of human relationship, material power and progress will but serve to increase the afflictions of mankind. Being a practical, realistic, and pragmatic people, they launched their frontal attack upon this vital question, and in so doing have produced a great mass of ethical and political philosophy.10 For the same reason they rejected both the abstruse metaphysical speculations of the Hindu, and the explorations into logic that have been one of the major contributions of occidental philosophy. This practical concern with the imme- diate exigencies of human life helps once more to explain, perhaps, why the Chinese, although they have contributed to the world many inventions of the highest practical value, such as paper, printing, porcelain, and the mariner's compass, have not developed a theoretical natural science. Coupled with this intense preoccupation with human affairs is the Chinese feeling for time; the feeling that human affairs should be fitted somehow into a temporal framework. The result has been the accumulation of a tremendous and unbroken body of historical literature, extending over more than three thousand years, such as is unequalled by any -other people. This history has served in China a distinctly moral purpose, for by studying the past one might learn how to conduct oneself in the present and future. Hence the writing of history was commonly not left merely to the whim of a few historically minded individuals. Ever since the founding of the first long lived empire in the second century B. C., one of the first duties of a conquering dynasty has been to compile the history of the dynasty it supplanted, often appointing for that purpose a large board of government-supported scholars, who were set to work upon the historical archives of the preceding dynasty. The resulting 9 See Bodde, " Types of Chinese Categorical Thinking," JAOS 59. 2 (1939), 200-19. 10 Which, however, did not always attain the prag- matic goal aimed at, because it sometimes fell into the common error of assuming that morality is something that can be realized automatically through the mere preaching of lofty doctrines, without sufficient regard for the practical human difficulties (economic and other- wise) that lie in the way of the realization of these doctrines. Here is perhaps the most serious indictment that can be made of Confucianism, but it is one that is very far from being universally true. This is shown by the fact that a great many Confucian thinkers were not mere philosophers in an ivory tower, but were at the same time men of affairs who were active in government, and who there directly concerned themselves with politi- cal programs that would serve to carry their ideals into operation.</page><page sequence="5">BODDE: Dominant Ideas in the Formation of Chinese Culture 297 dynastic histories were not limited to a bald nar- ration of political events. They included also valu- able essays on such subjects as economics, law, water-control works, astronomy, bibliography, geo- graphy, and many other topics, as well as the bio- graphies of hundreds of illustrious individuals. This temporal mindedness of the Chinese once more marks them sharply apart from the Hindus.:" What was the nature of the society that the Chinese thus took such pains to record? It was not one that believed in what we would call rugged individualism. Rather, Confucianism aimed at teaching each individual how to take his place with the least possible friction in his own social group, and how to perform his allotted duties within that group in such a way as would bring the greatest benefit to the group as a whole. The basic and most important unit of Chinese society was the family or clan, to which the individual owed his first allegi- ance, and which he served, first by sacrificing to the ancestors who were dead; secondly, by caring for the elder generation who were still living; and thirdly, by rearing descendants of his own who would carry on the family line. In return, the family acted as a protective group of mutual aid, shielding the individual from an often hostile outer world. Through its cohesiveness, it succeeded in maintaining the fabric of Chinese life and culture even in times of almost complete social and political collapse. Because of this stress upon family in China, there has been a correspondingly limited development of nationalistic feeling (save in a vague cultural sense), and little of that fiery pa- triotism so exalted in the West. Beyond the family, nevertheless, lay the state, which was regarded simply as an enlargement of the family unit. Thus even to-day the term for "nation" in Chinese, literally translated, means " national family," 12 while it was common in the past for the emperor to refer to himself as "the parent of the people." 13 In this society each in- dividual occupied a definite position and was held accordingly responsible for the performance of stated duties. Yet paternalistic though it was, the system certainly did not (in theory, at least) operate solely for the benefit of a ruling class. If inferiors were expected to serve their superiors with loyalty, superiors were equally bound by certain definite obligations toward their inferiors. Con- fucianism stressed the reciprocal nature of these duties and obligations. It also emphasized that the primary duty of the ruler is to give good govern- ment to his people, and that to do this he must himself set a high moral standard and select with care the officials who serve under him. It thus at- tached great importance to the power of personal example of men in public life, and the need for their moral self cultivation. Owing to the development of a very intensive agricultural economy, stimulated in part, at least, by a widespread government-fostered system of irrigation works, it was possible in China for a large population to subsist upon a comparatively small amount of land. Having this large popula- tion, the Chinese empire spread to huge proportions and developed into an exceedingly complex bu- reaucracy, employing a vast army of officials. Yet despite its size and all inclusive character, the Chinese state remained sufficiently fluid and flexible to leave a place for considerable social change and individual initiative. It aimed at moral suasion rather than legalistic compulsion, and definitely rejected the somewhat cold and mechanical ap- proach to government, based on law, which has been such a cornerstone of occidental civilization. Law codes, of course, existed, but they were subject to a considerable degree of individual judgment and interpretation, which was based upon the handed- down body of traditional experience and morality known as 1i f. It was quite possible, therefore, in Chinese society, especially in times of political change, for deter- mined individuals to work their way up to high positions, a feat accomplished several times in his- tory by founders of dynasties who rose from quite humble origins. Women, similarly, though before the law they held an inferior position, yet in point of fact quite frequently exercised very considerable power within their family group. Thus China has produced a goodly number, not only of famous beauties, but also of female painters, poets, his- torians, and empresses. There was, in fact, little in Chinese society suggestive of any hard and fixed stratification into unchanging social groups. The moral basis for this society was the belief, shared by the majority of Chinese thinkers, that man is by nature fundamentally good; that there is no such thing as original sin; and that therefore any person, even the lowliest, is potentially capable 11 For a good account of this subject, see Charles S. Gardner, Chinese Traditiontal Historiography (Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 1938). 1K2 Kuo chia IN *I 13 Min chih fu' mu K Z</page><page sequence="6">298 BoDDE: Dominant Ideas in the Formation of Chinese Culture of becoming a sage.'4 Evil, according to the Chinese view, does not exist as a positive force in itself; it is simply the result of a temporary deflection from the essential harmony of the universe. With these concepts go the optimism, the good humor, and the will to live, that are marked characteristics of so many Chinese. The Indian dictum that life is suffering was inconceivable to the Chinese mind, and even with the coming of Buddhism never suc- ceeded in gaining general acceptance. Because they believed that all men can be taught morality, the Chinese attached an importance hardly paralleled elsewhere upon the value of learn- ing. " Wisdom " was included by them among the five cardinal virtues, meaning by this an under- standing of right and wrong and of moral principles generally. Hence the Chinese stress upon their classics, which they regarded as containing deep moral truths; upon history as an instrument where- by man may be taught to avoid the mistakes of his forefathers; and eventually upon all humanistic scholarship. All this led to the creation of what has been the most distinctive feature of Chinese government, the famed examination system. Other countries have until recent times with few exceptions been ruled by a hereditary aristocracy, a priesthood, a military hierarchy, or a rich merchant class. But in China, ever since the creation of the first long lived empire in the second century B. C., entry into the bureauc- racy that governed the country was limited to those who succeeded in passing a series of very strict governmental examinations, based upon a thorough knowledge of the Chinese classics. Service in this official bureaucracy was the highest goal which one could attain, and therefore success in the examina- tions was the highest aim. Such, at least, was the theory. In practice, the system naturally operated best in periods of strong political unity, while in times of strife or dynastic change it tended to break down. Likewise, it con- tained certain manifest defects, such as its undue stress upon memory, and the fact that the wealthy naturally enjoyed superior opportunities to acquire the education that would make success possible.15 Nevertheless, when all is said and done, the fact remains that the examinations provided an im- partial and purely intellectual test that had to be surmounted by each and every individual through his own efforts alone if he were to enter the coveted ranks of the scholar-officials. Likewise, the exami- nations were open to all members of society alike, with but trifling exceptions. It is little wonder, therefore, that Voltaire, comparing this system with the political conditions of Europe of his time, acclaimed the organization of the Chinese state as the best the world had ever seen."6 l4Not everyone, of course, held this belief. Thus the Confucian, HsUn Tzft (ca. 298-ca. 238 B. C.), proclaimed that man's nature is essentially evil. Yet even he main- tained that man can be taught goodness. His school, moreover, was eventually rejected in favor of that of Mencius (372 ?-289? B. c.), who was the chief proponent of the doctrine of the goodness of human nature. ""Another weakness of the governmental system was the fact that the officials were often inadequately paid, thus encouraging them to look toward various forms of illegitimate revenue as a means of increasing their in- come. The same tendency was strengthened by an un- fortunate feature of the family system, according to which any successful member of a family was under a moral obligation to give support to his less prosperous relatives. These defects, however, apply more to the bureaucratic system as a whole than to the examinations per se, and they were at least in part compensated for by a very intricate and ingenious system of checks and balances designed to reduce the abuse of office to a mini- mum. Considering the size and geography of China, its government has operated with a considerable degree of efficiency over a very long period of time, and certainly during many epochs with less corruption than most Westerners commonly believe. "I Voltaire's exact words are: "One need not be obsessed with the merits of the Chinese to recognize that the organization of their empire is in truth the best that the world has ever seen, and moreover the only one founded on paternal authority." Cf. his (Euvres completes (Gotha, 1785), XXXVIII, 492; quoted in Adolph Reich- wein, China and Europe (translated from the German by J. C. Powell, New York, 1925), p. 89. Voltaire was not, of course, aware of certain abuses in the Chinese governmental system. One of these, though by no means unique to China, has been of particular consequence owing to the dense concentration of popu- lation upon the arable land. This has been the ever present tendency for such land gradually to gravitate into the hands of a comparatively small landowning class; a class largely made up of those same scholar-officials who governed the country, and who owing to their con- tempt for trade usually preferred to invest their money in land rather than in commercial enterprise. An ex- amination of Chinese history will reveal this process of land accumulation taking place during the course of almost every long lived Chinese dynasty. The result has been the laying of an ever increasing economic bur- den upon the peasants, leading finally to revolt, over- throw of the dynasty, and a subsequent redistribution of the land. Though many ingenious governmental measures have repeatedly been instituted to check this dynastic cycle, they have never (as might be expected) been per- manently successful. Indeed, even to-day one of the most important problems confronting the existing gov- ernment is this same age old question of the distribution of land.</page><page sequence="7">BODDE: Dominant Ideas in the Formation of Chinese Culture 299 As a corollary to the Chinese respect for learning has been a corresponding dislike of violence and strife. Reason, arbitration and compromise are (in theory, if sometimes not in practise) the in- struments for settling disputes in China, and the man who resorts to force shows by that very fact that he is in the wrong. China has had her share of strife, yet a large anthology could be compiled of the essays and poems that have been written lamenting the suffering and horrors of war. The poor but worthy scholar has been the typical hero of much Chinese literature, while there has been very little of that glorification of the military genius so characteristic of the West. Perhaps the prevail- ing attitude toward the soldier is best summed up in the popular proverb which says: " Good iron is not beaten into nails; a good man does not become a soldier." 17 Finally, a few words remain to be said about one of the most fundamental concepts underlying the Chinese theory of government, that of the so-called Right of Revolution. According to this theory, the ruler, being the " Son of Heaven," enjoys a divine sanction for his rule in the shape of a celestial Mandate or Decree which has been conferred on him by Heaven. As long as he rules in the interests of the people he may not be legally overthrown. Bad government, however, is displeasing to Heaven, which then indicates its dissatisfaction through the appearance of inauspicious natural phenomena, such as droughts, floods, or earthquakes. If these warn- ings go unheeded, heavenly disapproval is further manifested in the form of popular revolts, which may even culminate in the ruler's dethronement and the founding of a new dynasty. Success in such a revolt becomes the criterion of whether or not Heaven has withdrawn its Mandate from the evil ruler and passed it on to the new line. This theory, which originated in China before the first millenium B. c., was much elaborated by later writers, and is perpetuated at the present time in the term for revolution, Ico ming Sir, which literally means " changing the Decree." To- gether with the influence of the non-hereditary scholar class, it has acted as a strong check upon the abuse of power by the sovereign, and thus has given to China a sort of ideological preparation for democratic institutions, which, there is good reason to hope, will enable her in the future to assume her rightful place among the world's great democracies. CONCLUSION We have now reached the end of our lightning journey through the three worlds of the super- natural, of nature and of man, and have gained a fleeting glimpse of their main contours, as they appear to occidental eyes. Before closing, however, I should like to reaffirm the importance of one concept to which I have already more than once alluded, namely, the fundamental oneness and har- mony of the Chinese Weltanschauung. In the Chi- nese mind, there is no real distinction between the world of the supernatural, the world of nature, and the world of man. They are all bound up in one all-embracing unity. " All things are complete within me," proclaims the Confucian, Mencius (371 ?-2 79 ? B. c.) ,18 thus echoing the sentiment of the Taoist, Chuang Tzui (ca. 369-ca. 286 B. C.), who says: "Heaven and Earth came into being with me together, and with me, all things are one."A 19 As applied to social relationships, these concepts manifest themselves in the emphasis of Chinese writers upon restraint, tolerance, equanimity, and pursuit of the golden mean. "Let the states of equilibrium and harmony exist in perfection, and a happy order will prevail throughout Heaven and Earth, while all things will be nourished and pros- per." So says the Doctrine of the Mean, one of thE works that was formerly learned by heart in the traditional system of education.20 To-day the worlk is convulsed by a terrifying struggle. But when that struggle is over, may we of the West find it in our heart to exercise these principles in the new world that emerges. It will be a world in which we and the peoples of the East will be working and cooperating together as never before in history Assuredly it must be one in which all creeds and races of East and West alike live on a basis o: justice, equality and brotherhood. 17 Hao t'ieh pu ta ting; 3d [ TU*T; Hao jen pu tang ping X *f A -'; It is only during the present Sino-Japanese War that this attitude has changed and the Chinese soldier has come to be regarded as something more than a parasite of society and an agent of destruction. 8'Mencius, VIIa, 4. 19 Transl. of Fung Yu-lan, Chuang Tzg (Shanghai, 1933), ch. 2, p. 56. 20 Transl. of Legge, Sacred Books of the East (Oxford, 1885), XXVIII, 300-1.</page></plain_text>
