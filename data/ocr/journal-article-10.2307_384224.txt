<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Production of Julien Green: Microcosm of Mid-Century Writing by Marilyn Gaddis Rose I N 1926 Julien Green's first novel, Mont Cindre, brought him to the attention of critics. The following year his first best-seller, Adrienne Mesurat, made him well-known, and in the intervening decades nearly 300 critics in Europe, North and South America and Asia Minor have responded to his twenty-four principal works.' However, most of these critics have hesitated to clasify him, or, indeed, identify him with any specific grouping in French literature.2 Yet when his production is analyzed with respect to both form and content, it is found to epitomize superior French prose of the mid-cen- tury. This is the case because Green's work represents a synthesis of both tradition and revolt. Neither aspect can be emphasized without deforming the finely executed equilibrium which is the key to Green's technique. His prose maintains a rapport between the fictional world and means of expression used by Mme. de la Fayette, Balzac, Stendhal, Zola (to whom Green has been compared in passing), enriched by the present elder statesmen of French letters, Francois Mauriac and Georges Duhamel, as well as the late Roger Martin du Gard and Georges Ber- nanos; and the unstable universe and its idiom developed by his con- temporaries, Jean-Paul Sartre, Jean Anouilh, Andr6 Malraux, or Albert Camus. In fact, Green's novelette, "L'Autre Sommeil" (1930), is one of the earliest explicit treatments of the homme absurde theme. More- over, Claude Mauriac, pointing out Green and Kafka's parallel con- cepts of reality in his recent appraisal of nouveau rdalisme, makes spe- cial mention of not only this story but also the earlier Le Voyageur sur la terre (1926) as landmarks in "aliterature."3 1 Besides the two novels named above, his works include: Le Voyageur sur la terre, 1926, Suite anglaise, "Les Clefs de la mort," 1927; Liviathan, 1929; "L'Autre Sommeil," 1930; 'Epaves, 1932; Le Visionnaire, 1934; Minuit, 1936j Varouna, 1940; Memories of Happy Days, 1942; Si j'dtais vous ..., 1947; Morra, 1950; Sud, 1953; L'Ennemi, 1954; Le Malfaiteur, 1955; L'Ombre, 1956; Journal I-VI (1928-54), 1938- 55. 2 A discussion of the critical treatment Green's works have received may be found in my unpubl. diss. (Missouri, 1958), "The Critical Reaction to Julien Green (1926- 56)." 8 The New Literature, trans. Samuel I. Stone (New York, 1959), p. 34. 164</page><page sequence="2">JULIEN GREEN 165 Green's seemingly conventional pattern of narration, especially at the beginning of a novel or shorter prose piece, reassures the reader who might have some prejudices against experimental writing. The progres- sion is chronological. Green uses either standard first-person devices, e.g., the discovered diary in Le Voyageur sur la terre, "Les Clefs de- la mort," and Manuel's rdcit in Le Visionnaire; the day-by-day journal of part III of Varouna; reminiscences in "L'Autre Sommeil," Marie- Th6r~se's rdcit in Le Visionnaire, and "Christine." Or, the work may start at or near the beginning of a crisis with a third-person viewpoint, as in Mont-Cindre, Adrienne Mesurat, Ldviathan, Epaves, Minuit, Si j'dtais vous..., Moira, and, of course, the three plays. The reader's trust is enlisted by detailed descriptions which situate the action in everyday experience. In Epaves, for example, one knows how the Cltry household is furnished and what type of clothing the occupants wear. For Mont-Cintre and Le Voyageur sur la terre Green actually repro- duced two homes belonging to members of his family.4 Even in Le Visionnaire where this type of photographic description is least in evi- dence Marie-ThWrtse confides that when she says something naughty her mother washes out her mouth with soap, and other such homely details. Green, however, in following the logical development of his charac- ters' inner responses to life around them, is able to shift the perspec- tive away from a matter-of-fact transcription of daily life, toward the ndant-obsessed consciousness of the metaphysical rebel. He may adopt the wondrous perspective of childhood or adolescence that animistical- ly recognizes an unknowable quality in objects and acts. This occurs in "Christine," part I of Minuit, the sections of "Les Clefs de la mort," and "L'Autre Sommeil," in which the protagonists relive their early years, and to a lesser extent in all his other works where young people have a prominent role (Mont-Cinere, Le Visionnaire, Varouna, Sud, L'Ombre). A second perspective which enables Green to shift to un- reality is the focus-changing dream which figures significantly in all of his works, except Mo~ra; as does his third distorting perspective, that of his anguished icharacters in the clutches of fear, lust, or apathy, who see objects and acts in terms of the importance which they attach to them. These dreams or obsessions may be a by-product of the plot, as in Mont-Cindre, Adrienne Mesurat, and Epaves, or be directly re- sponsible for the plot, as in Le Voyageur sur la terre and Le Vision- narie. Finally, there is Green's own visual composition which heightens 4 Journal, I, 11 dtcembre 1928, 12 ddcembre 1933, 5 fWvrier 1934; Journal, II, 26 juin 1937.</page><page sequence="3">166 FRENCH REVIEW situations by a theatrical use of light and dark. He has much of the action take place at night, twilight, or in darkened rooms. This gives him an opportunity to dramatize with squares of moonlight through a window, a circle of light cast by a globe lamp and the like. Inciden- tally, there is a general absence of hue in Green's works, except for Epaves. For the most part, garnet, brown, and black are used for cloth- ing and interiors. Blond Hedwige (Le Malfaiteur) and redheaded Jo- seph Day (Mo'ira) are exceptions among the brunette protagonists. Moreover, as Green turns his perspective in his somber kaleidoscope, he increases the climactic tensions which depends upon the warped perspective. The overall crescendo has been consciously modulated so that each chapter has its own minor climax. The crescendo is often strengthened by recurring themes. Thus, the vicountess' startling ap- pearances in Le Visionnaire or the inexplicable voices heard by the narrator in "Les Clefs de la mort" revive the fading suspense. The frenzy that is growing within the central character, by now so disoriented that he sees the outer world in his own crazed image, is, however, expressed in impeccable, traditional syntax that ensures a rap- port with the reader. When Adrienne Mesurat, stunned, returns to her room after pushing her father down the stairwell, Green describes her crisis without taking any liberties with grammar: "Ses bourdonnements l'avaient prise de nouveau. Elle Ccouta cette esp&amp;ce de flux et de reflux dans sa tate. Un moment, elle eut l'impression qu'il provenait de I'ex- tdrieur, d'un autre coin de la chambre et qu'il augmentait" (p. 166). Or from a more recent novel, Moira, when Joseph Day is bewildered by a sign of love from the homosexual artist: "I1 s'assit h la table et cacha son visage dans ses grandes mains. Peu a peu son irritation tom- bait. Il voulait etre bon, parler avec douceur, mais quelque chose d'im- pr6vu l'en emp&amp;chait toujours, le troublait. Les gens n'agissaient presque jamais comme il croyait pouvoir s'y attendre, ce qu'ils faisaient, ce qu'ils disaient surtout le heurtait, il ne pouvait pas les comprendre" (p. 73). Green puts the reader further off guard by occasionally moralizing in the Balzacian manner. Typical examples of this are: "A la vdrit6, il n'est pas d'endroit au monde auquel on ne puisse s'habituer et oh l'on ne decouvre une raison de se trouver bien" (Mont-Cinkre, Paris: A. Fayard, 1950, p. 17). "Combien de detenus n'ont-ils pas fr6mi d'in- quietude joyeuse aux tours de clef quotidiens?" (Adrienne Mesurat, p. 27). "Au fond, cette recherche du beau absolu dans un domaine oi il semble rare n'6tait que de la froideur d6guisde..." (Le Malfaiteur, p. 113). The end result, however, is far from Balzac and the legacy of the</page><page sequence="4">JULIEN GREEN 167 traditional novel. The unbalanced state of Green's characters is so per- vasive that it radically alters the terra firma of common sense experi- ence that has always been sufficiently omnipotent to control traditional protagonists from the Comtesse de Tende to Julien Sorel or, more re- cently, Therdse Desqueyroux. Instead, Green's characters, like those of Malraux, Sartre, or Camus, are buffeted about in a universe in which a Divine Plan, if such exists, is beyond the comprehension of man, mis- led by his faith in an anthropomorphic God. With Green every cen- tral character from Emily Fletcher (Mont-Cindre) to Philip Anderson (L'Ombre), each one a pessimistic personification of man in the ab- stract, undertakes a metaphysical revolt that fails humiliatingly. Emily and Adrienne both act from a vague conviction that outside their im- prisoning families there exists a state of happpiness to which they are entitled. When Emily discovers a new tyrant in her husband, she sets fire to her home and burns with it. When Adrienne becomes subcon- sciously aware that her father's fixation on routine has become an in- eradicable part of her personality and that she cannot transcend her- self through love, she loses her mind. Both Manuel (Le Visionnaire) and Joseph (Moira) have a spiritual drive, in Joseph's case an authen- tic call to the Methodist ministry, that is frustrated by an equally strong sensual nature. This inner conflict undermines Manuel's health so acutely that he dies after having found a morbid release in his dream world. Joseph's physical vigor forces him to externalize his violence. He kills his seducer, Moira (the Mary of his destiny, a play on both the Celtic and Greek meanings). Joseph decides to accept himself as is shown by his surrender to the authorities. In many of Green's novels and plays there is such a lack of harmony between man and the universe that the defeat of the protagonist-victim injures many of the other personages, too-enemies, friends, and com- paratively innocent secondary characters. For instance, in Ldviathan Gueret's lust, Mme. Grosgeorges' boredom, and Mme. Londe's patholog- ical curiosity combine not only to wreck their own lives but also the lives of Angble (ward of Mme. Londe and object de Gueret's passion), Gueret's wife, Mme. Grosgeorges' son, and Fernande, a child being groomed to take Angdle's place as a part-time prostitute. The funda- mental instability of the visionary Edme in Minuit is' responsible for the deaths of his adherent and the two who rebelled, Serge and Elisa- beth, even though Edme established the community at Fontfroide in order to expiate his desertion of Elisabeth and her mother. In all three plays there is open repudiation of what is conventionally termed jus- tice, either human or divine. The innocent are harmed as well as the</page><page sequence="5">168 FRENCH REVIEW guilty. The first cannon volleys of the Civil War sound in Sud just as Ian's suicide (he provoked a duel and refused to defend himself) has brought to light the hopelessly twisted lives of the other characters. L'Ennemi, thus Elisabeth de Silleranges refers to the voice of God speaking through her conscience, seems inimical to either human hap- piness or resignation. As for L'Ombre, the machinations of James Fer- ris and later his son Joel seem so lacking in justifiable human motiva- tion that they are more like shadows of cosmic evil fallen upon Philip Anderson and his luckless family. In short, unlike some of the heroes of Green's contemporaries named earlier, none of his characters ever derives any benefit from free action, sincerity, or penance. Despite their pathetic situation, the protagonists have a grotesqueness about them which repels sympathy. Being in a world that is hateful to them, they retaliate, quasi-instinctively, by being hateful themselves. Few of them seem normal by conventional standards. In fact, in Green's entire pro- duction there are only eleven kindly characters, and none of these is the central character (Reverend Sedgwick, Mont-Cin?re; M. and Mme Le- rat, Minuit; Marie-Th&amp;rese, Le Visionnaire; H~l6ne Lombard, her aunt Marguerite and Jeanette, Varouna; David Bruce and Professor Tuck, Mozra; Edith and John Anderson, L'Ombre). With the exceptions of Joseph in Moira or Ian in Sud, the characters have such traumatized minds that they cannot imagine how they reached such a predicament or what they could do to resolve it. They cannot even learn to accept themselves, unless it be with loathing, e.g., Elisabeth in L'Ennemi, Ian in Sud, Joseph in Moira. When they have friends who can give good advice, as in Mont-Cinhre, Moira, or L'Ombre, they are constitutional- ly unable to follow it, even if they consciously want to do so. Even their dreams are of more help to the reader than to them. Possibly Green's world view is bleaker than that of his fellow writers since he recognizes supernatural powers. Sometimes this is a mysterious force like the apparently schizophrenic condition of Le Voyageur sur la terre's protagonist, Daniel O'Donovan, who died, nevertheless, by "visitation de Dieu"; the spell of Fontfroide in Minuit; the devil's in- cantation in Si j'ftais vous.,; the chain of destiny in Varouna. At other times, the malice of fate is embodied in another character: either an incredibly mean human .being, e.g., .Mrs. Fletcher in Mont-Cinbre, M. Mesurat in Adrienne Mesurat; or an evil creature with questionable human ties, e.g., Jalon in "Les Clefs de la mort," Pierre in L'Ennemi, James and Joel Ferris in L'Ombre. Against these antagonists the cen- tral characters are powerless. They are alone in a world which offers no certainty but catastrophe.</page><page sequence="6">JULIEN GREEN 169 This universe in which Green has placed them with the precision of Flaubert or the inevitability of Zola is not the world of traditional concepts, but for Green and the writers of his generation it is perhaps more real. By synthesizing the rebellious world view of the twentieth century and the means of communication developed by traditional French writers, Green reveals himself a partisan of both tradition and revolt. Far from being unclassifiable in French literature, his work may be called a precis of serious French fiction of the mid-century. STEPHENS COLLEGE</page></plain_text>
