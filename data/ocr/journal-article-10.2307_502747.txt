Kantor The Chronology and Interconnections of the Cycladic Islands in the Neolithic Period and the Early Bronze Age JOHN E. COLEMAN Since the second edition of Chronologies' there has been considerable progress in our knowledge of the Cyclades. The Neolithic site of Saliagos has revealed a wholly new period of occupation and much useful work has been carried out, notably by Renfrew and Doumas. The lack of stratified sites dating to the EBA remains a great problem, but it is alleviated somewhat by detailed studies of the cemeteries, and by the availability of a greater range of comparative material from neighboring areas. The discovery of Melian obsidian in Mesolithic levels in the Franchthi cave2 indicates that the Cyclades were already being visited by 7000 B.C., although there is not yet evidence that they were settled at such an early date.* During the Neolithic period and the EBA the use of Melian obsidian be- comes ever more frequent and widespread in the Aegean area.3 The earliest settlements so far recog- nized date to the beginning of the LN period. Sites from this time, apparently closely related to one another, are now known from Melos itself,4 My- conos,5 Antiparos,6 and the islet of Saliagos,7 which was apparently a promontory connected with Anti- paros in Neolithic times. The latter provides a fairly full picture of the earliest occupation. Three strata were distinguished. Stratum I, the lowest, produced only a small fragment of a wall * "Chronologies," as before, was edited by Edith Porada. 1 The Author decided not to issue preliminary reports before the final publication. 2 A detailed interim report by P.P.

COLEMAN [AJA 78 and a few floors, hearth areas and pits. Stratum 2 produced scanty remains of two buildings more or less rectilinear in plan and a circular structure (inner dia. about 2.5 m.) paved with stones, perhaps to be identified as a granary. Stratum 3, the upper- most, produced a building complex, rectangular in plan and at least 15 m. by 14 m. The outer wall was massive in places as if for defense. Only a few features of the interior of the complex were clear: along the western side three small, roughly rec- tangular compartments, perhaps basement store- rooms, adjoined the outer wall; elsewhere there are curious parallel rows of stones placed close to one another which the excavators suggest might have been underpinnings for a wooden floor.8 The building complex of Stratum 3 was abandoned or destroyed without indication of burning and there were only scanty traces of occupation at the site after it went out of use. Architectural comparisons are hindered by the fragmentary state of the remains at Saliagos. The building complex of Stratum 3 does not resemble the most common house types of the mainland of Greece in the Middle and Late Neolithic (i.e. the megaron and the "Tsangli" house). Its outer wall does not appear to have the character of a true fortification wall: it is unlike the enclosure wall of the MN period at Sesklo, which follows the edge of the hillside; still less does it resemble the con- centric walls of LN Dimini, or the EBA circuit walls at Chalandriani in Syros and at Lerna. A recently discovered fortified EC site at Panormos in Naxos' is about the same size but its plan is less regular and there is no reason to connect it with Saliagos. The pottery of Saliagos has a strongly local char- acter. The shapes are few and uncomplicated: flat-bottomed bowls with rounded sides, pedestalled bowls and simple jars, either with plain rim, collar neck or flaring neck. Most vessels have simple lugs or lug-handles about halfway between rim and bottom, but there are also various horned handles, crescent-shaped lugs and tabs at the rims. The most distinctive feature of the pottery is the use of a matt white paint on a dark ground in a variety of rec- tilinear and curvilinear patterns. White paint ap- pears first on the mainland of Greece in Thessaly during the Sesklo period."' It is found along with burnished patterns on the distinctive gray, brown, and black burnished wares which appear at the end of the MN period or the beginning of the LN period in Thessaly," Central Greece,12 and Cor- inth.'3 White paint is also used on some of the pottery of Dimini types'4 often in combination with red and black. The pottery of Saliagos has some similarities both with the black wares with white paint'5 and with white painted Dimini pottery.'6 It also has a general resemblance to the matt painted wares of the lower mainland, both in shape and in motifs. Although the curvilinear decoration at Saliagos includes concentric circles, spirals and meander patterns such as are found on the fully developed Dimini wares do not occur. Other types of decoration occur at Saliagos, al- though much less frequently than white paint. There is a type of incised decoration in which bands are outlined with incision and filled with pointill6. Similar decoration is known from Thessaly, Attica, Crete and the islands of the E. Aegean, apparently in LN contexts"7 but it does not seem possible to assign it to a specific phase of this long period. A few examples of crusted red and pattern burnished decoration were also found; these anticipate the use of such techniques at Kephala. About a dozen small sherds decorated in dark on light patterns found throughout the deposit were the only im- ported pieces recognized; they have their closest analogies with the matt painted pottery of Central and Southern Greece.'8 The presence of these imported sherds and the general resemblance of the white painted pottery to matt painted pottery would suggest that Saliagos should be considered no earlier than the beginning of the LN period. On the other hand, the absence of spirals and meanders would suggest that the 8 Saliagos 25. 9 Ch. Doumas, Deltion 19 (1964) Chr. 411-12. 10 A 3 a ware: Ch.

Jugs and juglets, which are among the commonest shapes at Beyce- sultan, do not occur at Saliagos. White paint is rarer at Beycesultan and the patterns are simpler and almost completely rectilinear (multiple chev- rons, lozenges, cross-hatching, etc.). The white painted decoration found at Tigani in Samos,21 Ayio Gala in Chios, and Vathy in Kalimnos22 ap- pears to have more in common with that of Beyce- sultan than with that of Saliagos. Saliagos certainly does not appear to be at a midway stage between the eastern type of white painted pottery and that of the mainland of Greece; if anything, it seems to have been an offshoot of mainland styles. It offers no support for any theory which would bring white paint, or, for that matter, the MN and LN black burnished ware of mainland Greece from Ana- tolia.23 The obsidian industry at Saliagos is unusually fine; tanged points are one of the characteristic types and the excavators suggest24 that they were used for fishing rather than hunting since there is evidence that the tunny fish was a major item in the diet. Almost all the obsidian is from Melos, but there are a few pieces from Antiparos itself and one from Giali in the E. Aegean. The obsidian industry as a whole has as yet no close parallels in the Aegean; it is different from that of Kephala, which was predominantly a blade and flake tool industry. Tanged points like those from Saliagos have been found at a number of sites on the main- land of Greece, often in LN contexts;25 it is possible that some of these were exported in a finished con- dition from the Cyclades. Among the most significant finds are two marble figurines. One, a seated steatopygous female, was a welcome find in that it confirmed the connec- tions of this type with the Cyclades, as Weinberg had suggested.26 The other is a "fiddle" figurine, a type which is most common in the first phase of the EC period. The Saliagos example differs from those of the EC period in having a notch which was prob- ably intended to represent the face. A few examples of schematic marble figurines with a general re- semblance to the one from Saliagos were found by Tsountas in Thessaly;27 none has an absolutely secure context, but they probably belong to the LN period.28 From the foregoing discussion it is evident that the Saliagos phase in the islands was contemporary with and related to an early stage of the LN period on the mainland of Greece. The five C"4 dates bear this out; they range from about 4200 to 3700 B.C.29 A recently published series of dates from the Franchthi cave suggests that the Late Neolithic began on the mainland of Greece about 4500 B.C. No close chronological equations are yet possible with Anatolia and Crete. There is still a gap in our knowledge of settle- ment in the islands between the time of Saliagos and that of Kephala in Keos. A C14 date from Kephala (P 1280) would suggest that this gap may have been as long as 8oo years; recent excava- tions at the Kitsos cave near Laurion, however, sug- gest that the Kephala date may be erroneously low (see infra) and that the gap may be less extensive. The Kephala phase of occupation is known in the Cyclades only from Keos at the northwestern fringe of the islands. Kephala was probably only one of several sites on the island.30 Its situation on a high promontory suggests not only dependence on the sea but also the need for natural defenses. The remains of the settlement were not well pre- served since the houses were built on a sloping hillside and erosion has been severe. The cemetery, which fared better, provides the earliest examples in Greece of graves with artificially constructed 19 I.e. Dimini III and IV as defined by V.

Thirty-five were built of fairly small stones and covered with slabs; the plans varied from round to rectangular; most had a maximum interior length of about o.8o m. to 1.10 m.; solid platform-like structures were built above some of the covers. The other five graves were all used for the burial of children or infants: two were slab-sided cists, one of which contained a burial jar, and three were simple jar burials. Graves were evidently used either for single burials or as multiple tombs. Fifteen of the twenty-five graves in which the burials were preserved contained single burials; the other ten contained from two to thir- teen, sometimes in a clear sequence. Since burials of men, women, and children were found in the multiple graves, each may have served for a family. There is a marked contrast between the cemetery at Kephala and the few LN burials so far discov- ered on the Greek mainland. Two contracted in- humations of individuals are known from Lerna;31 the associated pots suggest that they must be close in time to the Kephala graves, but the burials were made in simple pits, either within or very close to the settlement. At Prosymna human skeletal re- mains were found in a cave-like rock shelter in two successive strata, the lower with monochrome red ware probably earlier in date than the Late Neo- lithic, the upper with pottery similar to that of the Thessaly B period.32 Three skulls and scattered bones were found in the upper stratum but no com- plete skeleton; the excavator suggested that sec- ondary burial may have been practiced. At Alepo- trypa in the Mani remains of both primary and secondary interments were found.33 Human bones which displayed evidence of burning were found in several of the LN levels in the Kitsos cave and in one instance remains of a cremation were found in place on a hearth.34 Cremation is also known at Souphli Magoula in Thessaly, but there cremation urns were in use.35 This diversity of burial types within such a small area must reflect a great cul- tural diversity, if not ethnic change, in the LN period. At any rate, the burial customs provide no means of making chronological equations. The similarity of the grave types of Kephala with those of the EC period, on the other hand, are striking; although many of the latter are slab-sided cist graves, at least two built graves have been ex- cavated in Amorgos36 and several hundred in Syros.37 At Ayios Kosmas in an EB cemetery close- ly related to those of the Cyclades built graves were found side by side with cist graves.38 The incidence of multiple burial is higher at Kephala than in the EC cemeteries: among the more than six hundred graves excavated by Tsountas, there were only seventeen instances of multiple burials within the ordinary graves"3 and a few other instances in tiered graves.40 The pottery from Kephala was fairly crudely made and generally red in color. The shapes in- clude: bowls with curved or angular sides, either with flat bottom, ring foot, or pedestal; small jars with plain rims or collar or flaring necks; large jars in a variety of closed and open shapes; many fragments of "baking pans" with low pierced walls; a cylindrical object, possibly a stand; and, most dis- tinctive of all, the vessels dubbed "scoops." The only types of decoration were crusted red and (rarely) white, pattern burnishing, incision, and plastic ornament. Crusted decoration, which was not ap- plied in complex patterns at Kephala, may have been used for much of the LN period in neigh- bouring areas. The pattern burnished decoration provides a close link with Attica and the area immediately adjacent to it. At Kephala it consists of overall patterns made up of lines usually of about the same thickness and most often arranged in groups of parallel lines at oblique angles; cross- hatching also occurs, although more rarely, and there is one instance of a meandroid pattern and one of a spiral. Similarly decorated pottery has been found in considerable quantity in excavations on the acropolis at Thorikos41 and in the Kitsos cave42 31 Grave HTN. I: Caskey, Hesperia 27 (1958) 136-37.

In the meantime, it is ap- parent that the Kephala type is a relatively late stage. Pattern burnished decoration also provides a gen- eral link with the E. Aegean and Asia Minor. It is known from Tigani in Samos,51 and Besika Tepe52 and Kum Tepe in the Troad; a few sherds were also found at Beycesultan.53 The organization of the decoration is somewhat different from that found at Kephala: both fine and broad lines were used together, often in a sort of herring-bone pat- tern, and the decoration was sometimes confined to panels within solidly burnished areas. The pat- tern burnished decoration from the three eastern sites links them closely together, and it appears that they belong to a similar stage and should be re- garded as about contemporary with Kephala; the differences between the two types prohibit any more exact equation. The lack of detailed stratigraphic evidence at these sites does not permit the eastern type to be independently dated except as earlier than Troy I. The EBA pattern burnished ware from Crete, the "Pyrgos" ware, may also be related in a general way to the Kephala type but not so closely as to suggest that it was in exactly contemporaneous use. With a few exceptions, the incised decoration at Kephala is not so distinctive, and comparative mate- rial is not so well known that any close chronolog- ical connections can be established. Incision most frequently occurs in the form of multiple chevrons on the outside of the rims of bowls and jars, often on a thickened band. Rarely the patterns are more complex, sometimes including meandroid and spiral elements. One of the most significant chronological indica- tions is provided by the scoops.54 There are frag- ments of at least 36. Most were simply decorated; incision appears to have been largely confined to the handle and its struts, and crusted red occurs on some rim fragments. Meandroid elements occur in the incised decoration. A complete vessel of this shape was found at Sesklo, apparently in a Thessaly B context.55 Tsountas did not record the associated finds in detail and he himself had some misgivings about the date because it was unlike the usual in- cised pots of the period and was found at the side of the mound although "at a sufficient depth." These misgivings may now be laid to rest in view of the undoubted LN contexts of the other exam- ples known. Fragments of "at least four, and prob- ably several more""' are now recognized among the LN material from Athens and, once the character- istics of the shape are better known, it is likely that it will be recognized elsewhere as well. The Sesklo scoop is more extensively decorated than most of the examples from Kephala, although similar meandroid elements occur. Its closest parallels are the finest of the fragments from Athens.57 Scoops are probably related to the four-legged vessels of ritual purpose found in Central Greece and Cor- inth.58 These are found in the bothros in trench 3 at Elateia, which Weinberg dates to the MN period, but there were also fragments, some with curvilinear incised patterns, which, although un- stratified, should be recognized as Late Neolithic.59 43S.A.

COLEMAN [AJA 78 Although simpler in shape, scoops have many of the same characteristics as four-legged vessels (i.e. high swung handles and oblique mouth, which made them unsuitable as containers of fluids) and it is possible that they too were of ritual usage. Since scoops have not yet been found elsewhere in the Cyclades, whereas they do appear to be at home in Attica, there is no reason to consider them pri- marily "Cycladic." If they represent a modification of the four-legged vessels dating to the later part of the LN period, an origin on the mainland would seem more likely.60 Incised or grooved meandroid patterns are found on a thick heavy ware at Tigani in Samos"6 and Kalimnos.62 Although these patterns may be re- lated to those found on the advanced Dimini wares and to pottery of a similar stage in the Balkans, there seems no reason to connect them closely with Kephala or the Cyclades. All in all, the evidence of the pottery suggests that Kephala had close connections with Attica and its immediate environs in the LN period.63 Connections outside this limited area are only of a general sort. There are a few similarities between the pottery of Kephala and that of Saliagos in shape (plain rounded bowls, pedestalled bowl, jars with collar necks), but the decoration is almost entirely different. Clearly the one is at a considerable chronological, and perhaps cultural, remove from the other. There are, on the other hand, virtually no connections whatever between Kephala pottery and that of the earliest stage of the EC period (the "Pelos" stage or EC I); none of the character- istic types of EC I (pyxides, jars with conical necks, bowls with "rolled" rims) are found at Kephala. The chipped stone industry at Kephala is fairly crude. Blades and flakes are the most common prod- ucts; triangular scrapers are especially noteworthy among the few finely worked pieces. The industry has little similarity to that at Saliagos, where finely worked pieces are more frequent and varied; on the other hand, the blades from Kephala are more crude and exhibit a greater variety than those of the EBA industries. The figurines are all of terracotta. They com- prise crude females, apparently standing with arms outstretched, a standing male, and three heads which, although broken at the neck, are of great interest. Two64 are small, with flat triangular faces sloping backward from the neck; a projecting knob at the top of the face represents the nose and there is a corresponding knob at the back; one has string holes at the upper corners. A third is larger with perforations for wooden supports; although badly preserved, it evidently had a similar flat face. A head like the smaller ones from Kephala was found in the LN deposits at Athens.65 Figurines with similarly flattened faces are also known from Thessaly.66 The Kephala heads are not, therefore, inappropriate to a LN context. There are striking similarities to the heads of EC marble figurines of folded arm type, on the other hand, which strongly suggest a direct relationship. According to the chronology of EC figurines developed by Renfrew67 and Preziosi and Weinberg,68 however, the folded arm type does not occur until EC II; the figurines assigned to EC I are for the most part of schematic type with featureless rods or knobs for heads. These chronological systems are perhaps too rigid; there were probably intermediate stages between the Kephala heads and those of the folded arm fig- urines which have not yet been identified. Two types of marble vessels are found at Keph- ala: a shallow bowl and a pointed, nearly conical rhyton. Vertically elongated, horizontally pierced lugs appear on both types. The shallow bowl has parallels in both Neolithic and EBA contexts al- though the arrangements of the lugs cannot be exactly matched. On the other hand close paral- lels to the rhyton are few. One in the Copenhagen Museum69 is said to come from Naxos, but nothing else is known about its context. A fragment almost certainly from the lower part of another was found at Kum Tepe in the I c level;70 since it is only a 60 They may also be related to more simple and apparently utilitarian scoops found at Eutresis (in Group II) and Asea: J.L. and E.G.

The Kephala types are ob- viously related to the marble vessels of the EC pe- riod; similar lugs have so far not been found else- where in Neolithic contexts, but they are common in the EC period; there also appears to be a de- velopment from the pointed rhyton to the well known beaker of EC I. An example in the Gou- landris Collection,7 which is tall and narrow at the bottom, can be assigned to an intermediate phase in the development. Doumas records two projec- tions on the surface of the Goulandris vessel. They are placed in a position corresponding to the breasts on an anthropomorphic beaker in the Ashmo- lean.72 Both vessels probably had ritual significance. In this connection it is interesting to note a seated figurine in the Goulandris Collection,"3 which grasps a similar beaker in what is probably a ritual gesture. There is evidence that copper was refined or smelted at Kephala and worked into simple tools. The only tool complete enough to be identified is an awl; there are also fragments which are prob- ably from sharp-edged tools. One of the latter has been analyzed and found to consist of almost pure copper. No sources of copper are known on Keos to my knowledge and it is probable that the raw mate- rial was brought from elsewhere, perhaps the Laurion region. The evidence for metallurgy is not extensive and there is no reason to suppose that copper working was particularly important in the life of the site. A close parallel to this metalworking activity has recently been provided by the Kitsos cave, where Mme. Lambert reports finding a cop- per pin and small shapeless pieces of copper oxide in level III of Sondage 2."4 Among the finds from this level mentioned in the preliminary reports are pottery decorated with pattern burnishing, matt paint, and incision (including a scoop). It thus appears likely that this level represents the same general stage of the Neolithic as the finds from Kephala; there is, however, a discrepancy in the C"4 dates of several hundred years (see infra). Finds of copper objects in LN contexts have also been made at Sesklo75 and Knossos.76 It is now clear that metallurgy was known in Anatolia as early as the time of gatal Hiiyiik. Thus even with the new evidence from Kephala and the Kitsos cave, the Aegean appears to have been comparative- ly slow to develop a metallurgy of its own. From the foregoing discussion we may tenta- tively conclude that Kephala belongs to a late stage of the LN period and had strong connections with Attica and its environs. Its pottery, obsidian indus- try, and figurines are unlike those of Saliagos and the material culture represented at Kephala prob- ably did not develop directly from that represented at Saliagos. There are some marked similarities between Kephala and the EC culture (burial hab- its, figurine heads, stone vessels) but, to judge by the dissimilarity of the pottery, Kephala was not a direct predecessor of the EC culture; perhaps it was contemporary with a very early stage of the EC culture (or whatever immediately preceded it) in the southern and eastern Cyclades. For the absolute date of Kephala we are not wholly dependent upon the single radiocarbon date from the site itself (P i280: 2876 ? 56 B.C.). A consistent series of four dates from the Kitsos cave provides a useful check. GIF 16io from Level II in Sondage 2 (the later of the two levels in this Son- dage with affinities to Kephala) is at least 250 years earlier than the Kephala date; GIF 1280 from Level III in Sondage i, which also has affinities to Kephala, is at least 450 years earlier. Either the stage of culture represented at Kephala lasted from about the middle of the fourth millen- nium until the early third millennium (in uncali- brated dates), a considerable length of time, or, more likely, the date from Kephala is erroneously low (the sample came from close to the surface and may have been somewhat contaminated); Kephala should probably be dated to the latter half of the fourth millennium. It is worth noting that neither Saliagos nor Kephala offer much support for the theory of Ben- ton and Weinberg that the Dimini culture of Thessaly was influenced by or originated in the Cyclades.7 The few similarities between Saliagos and Dimini do not suggest an interrelationship of any great importance. There are closer parallels to the Sesklo scoop at Athens than at Kephala and 71 Ch. Doumas, The N.P. Goulandris Collection of Early Cycladic Art (Athens 1968) no. 57. 72 Emergence pl.

COLEMAN [AJA 78 spiraliform and meandroid decoration is so rare at Kephala that it is more likely to have been a prod- uct of Dimini influence than the reverse. Other- wise, there are remarkably few interrelations be- tween the Cyclades and Thessaly. We turn now to the EC culture. So much schol- arly work has been done in the last few years that it is not possible even to summarize it all. Un- fortunately, since a stratified site with a full EC sequence has still not been discovered and perhaps never will be, basic chronological problems still remain. It has long been clear that the middle phase of EC was largely absent at Phylakopi in Melos; recent excavations in settlements have produced evidence either for the middle phase of EC only78 or for the middle and late phases only.79 Two more or less distinct groups of cemetery material have traditionally been recognized to belong to the earlier phases of the EC period, the Pelos group and the Syros group. Some scholars regard these as essentially distinct chronologically and arrange them in a sequence;"8 others have suggested that they might be geographical and not chronological groups.8" Recently an attempt has been made by Colin Renfrew to separate these groups more clear- ly by statistical means.82 The material does not lend itself well to this approach: because there were only few, if any, grave goods in each grave (most graves contained nothing except bones), entire cemeteries are the smallest statistically viable unit; very few cemeteries, however, have been reported in full detail (even Tsountas published only representa- tive or outstanding graves). Nevertheless, Renfrew has succeeded in clarifying to some extent the defi- nitions of the groups; it is over the question of what each group represents that one must take issue with him. On the basis of Childe's definition of a culture as a "constantly recurring assemblage of artifacts" Renfrew has proposed the substitution of culture names for the more traditional division of the Aegean EBA into three phases.83 In the Cyclades for instance, the Pelos phase (or EC I) is to become the "Grotta-Pelos culture," the Syros phase (or EC II) is to become the "Keros-Syros culture" and the Phylakopi I phase (or EC III) is to be- come the "Phylakopi I culture." Along with this terminology Renfrew adopts the view, which was earlier suggested by Schachermeyr,84 that the "Keros-Syros culture" was essentially different from the "Grotta-Pelos culture." Consequently, among other things, he is "led to suggest the existence of an earlier and as yet undocumented phase of the Keros-Syros culture.""5 Such an argument is partic- ularly weak when we consider the quantity of EC material known, even if little of it has been legiti- mately excavated. It appears to me much more likely that Tsountas was correct in regarding the Syros material as essentially a development of what he had found on other islands"8 and that the EC culture forms a virtually uninterrupted sequence. Naturally there are changes which resulted from a cultural development over many hundreds of years. But the burial customs of the Pelos and Syros stages are similar (the non-functional en- trances to the Chalandriani graves must have been a local peculiarity), most of the general character- istics of the grave goods are the same, as Tsountas long ago observed," and many of the forms of artifacts in pottery and marble of the Syros phase have clear predecessors in the Pelos phase. Such a system as Renfrew proposes is best ap- plied to an area with marked geographical or ethnic boundaries; it is not particularly suitable for the prehistoric Aegean, where rapid communication by sea was a major factor in the development of civi- lization and where few clear-cut ethnic distinctions can be established. I would therefore suggest that the traditional terminology be retained and that Renfrew's divisions be equated with it as far as possible. Interpretation aside, Renfrew, Bossert,88 and Caskey"8 have come to something approaching a consensus with regard to the relative sequence. Renfrew's studies, which are the most comprehen- sive,"9 are the principal source for the following summary. 78E.g. Panormos in Naxos and Daskalio near Keros: Ch.

The settlement finds are characterized by bowls with rims thickened or rolled on the inside and, at Phylakopi, by pottery like that from the Pelos graves. Numerous cemeteries are known from this phase and they have a wide distribution in the southern Cyclades (i.e. Siphnos, Paros, Naxos, and the islands to the south of these). The finds from the cemeteries comprise a limited number of char- acteristic types; the pottery, which is often deco- rated with incision in "herring-bone" patterns, in- cludes jars with conical necks, either with or without pedestals, and spherical and cylindrical pyxides. Bossert and Renfrew agree in placing the so-called Kampos group near the end of the Pelos phase; it is characterized by frying pans with straight sides, barred handles and incised spirali- form decoration and by globular bottles. The marble objects of the Pelos phase include bowls, jars like those of clay with conical necks, usually with pedestals, but occasionally without (kandiles or kandilia), beakers (or "truncated rhyta"), and schematic figurines of several types, including "fiddle" figurines. Apparently toward the end of the Pelos phase two marble figurine types appear which foreshadow the more naturalistic figurines of the Syros phase; the Louros type"' and the Plastiras type.0" The Syros phase (EC II, the "Keros-Syros cul- ture") is known from settlements at Delos, Chal- andriani in Syros, Panormos in Naxos, and Dhas- kalio near Keros. The pottery from the settlements, which is often coated with an Urfirnis glaze, in- cludes plain conical bowls, globular jars with conical necks, jugs with both low and high necks, askoi and depa.93 Finds from this phase have been made in a good number of cemeteries in both the northern and the southern Cyclades. The cemetery material is much more varied than that of the Pelos phase. The pottery includes footed jars, frying pans, and rounded and cylindrical pyxides, all of which were probably developed from Pelos types, and sauceboats, one handled cups and pedestalled cups, which were evidently new types. Stamped and painted decoration occur for the first time in this phase. The marble artifacts include low bowls, sometimes spouted, pedestalled cups and, above all, "naturalistic" figurines, either standing or seated, with folded arms or in a limited variety of other poses. Finds of metal objects, which are very rare in graves of the Pelos phase, occur regularly, if not frequently, in those of the Syros phase. Naturally the development outlined may not have proceeded everywhere at the same pace and one can expect a certain amount of overlap be- tween earlier and later types. For instance, some graves contained types from both phases"g and finds from both phases within the same cemetery are not uncommon." One might be able to argue from such cases that the two groups of material should be considered more or less contemporary. The differences between them would then, how- ever, require some other explanation than that of chronological separation. Weinberg96 has suggested that they represent northern and southern varieties of EC culture. Remains of the Pelos group have largely been found in the southern Cyclades; those of the Syros group, on the other hand, have been found throughout the islands from Keos in the north to Thera in the south. The overlap of the two groups in the southern islands argues strongly against their being regional phenomena. It thus appears most likely that the distinction is primarily chronological, although only the excavation of a stratified settlement site could furnish proof of this. The relative sequence in the EBA Cyclades is of great importance to the interpretation of intercon- nections between the Cyclades and other Aegean areas. Since there are no C14 dates for the Cyclades in this period the absolute chronology depends to a large extent on these interconnections. The Syros phase is fairly easy in general to place within its Aegean context: fortifications, figurines and sauceboats link it firmly with EH II on the mainland," folded arm figurines link it to the EM 91 E.g.

COLEMAN [AJA 78 II in Crete,98 and depa link it to the Troy II-III stage in NW Anatolia."9 Weinbergo00 has argued that the Syros assemblage must overlap EH I and perhaps even the LN period on the mainland. The basis for this argument is that vessels apparently of Cycladic types, some with stamped decoration, were found in EH I contexts in the "lowest meter of deposit" at Eutresiso0' and at Palaia Kokkinia near the Peiraeus;102 similar sherds were also found at Korakou?' and Zygouries'04 in less precisely fixed but also probably early EH contexts. The "Cycladic" types from secure EH I contexts include a fragment of a frying pan from Palaia Kokkinia. Weinberg regards this pottery as closely connected with the Syros assemblage in the islands because of the stamped decoration and the incidence of frying pans. Bossert,'05 however, has pointed out signifi- cant differences between the islands and the main- land in the types of stamps and composition of the decoration; she also emphasized the distinctive character of the frying pans found on the main- land, which are most closely related to those of the Kampos group of the Pelos phase,06 and concluded that stamped decoration must have been used first on the mainland. The beginning of the Syros phase, therefore, probably coincided roughly with the beginning of EH II. Exact correlations for the Pelos phase are diffi- cult to establish. Since, as argued above, it contin- ued without a break into the Syros phase, it must have been largely contemporary with EH I. It may also have been partly contemporary with the LN period on the Greek mainland. Weinberg's argu- ments for such an overlap0"' on the grounds that Cycladic influences are evident at LN Dimini are less convincing now than when first formulated. Dimini pottery was evidently a product of con- tinuous development;'10 Kephala, as already men- tioned, provides no evidence that Cycladic spiraliform and meandroid decoration influenced Dimini styles, and such decoration is not a part of the Pelos phase repertoire as it is currently defined until near its end. On the other hand, the "Cyc- ladic" characteristics at Kephala (burial practices, figurine heads, marble vessels) may be taken to presuppose the existence of a very early stage of EC culture, whether represented by known finds or not. The rolled rims on bowls of the Pelos phase also point to a Neolithic origin, since such rims are known from Neolithic levels in the Kitsos cave."'9 Similar rims are also known in the Troad at Kum Tepe in pre-Troy I levels. Their cultural and chronological significance, however, should not be overestimated;"0 such a simple feature may have been long in use, as is attested by the similar rims on marble bowls of the Syros phase. There are some close correspondences both in the types of graves and in the forms of some of the clay and marble vessels between the Pelos phase and the recently excavated cemetery of Iasos in Caria."' The lasos graves are slab-sided cist graves; most are rectangular, but some are round in plan. The pottery so far published includes jars with conical necks similar in a general way to those from the Cyclades, jugs, some with cut-away spouts, two- handled flasks, and one-handled cups. The latest pottery from Iasos is probably to be dated in terms of the Anatolian sequence to the time of late Troy I or early Troy II. Among the grave goods are two marble beakers, perhaps imported from the Cyc- lades."' Beakers are primarily associated with the Pelos phase in the Cyclades; their discovery at Iasos therefore poses something of a problem since imports from the Aegean dating to the EB II phase (i.e. the Syros phase in the Cyclades) are found in Western Anatolia as early as the time of the mid- dle of Troy I. The beakers may have come from early graves in the sequence and they may also have been heirlooms when deposited in the graves. More probably, however, they continued in use into the Syros phase in the islands."3 It has been possible here to consider only a few 98 Emergence I99-2oo. 99 Bossert (supra n. 93). 100 In the works cited supra n. 77. 101 H.

The relative chronology which these relationships suggest is shown here in sche- matic form. For absolute dating we are almost completely dependent upon C" samples; as yet very few have been published for the EBA Aegean, however, and the dates shown are to be regarded as very tentative. In conclusion, I would like to summarize the evi- dence for the EB sequence which has been pro- duced by the recent excavations conducted by the University of Cincinnati at Ayia Irini in Keos.'"' This sequence is important because of the close in- terrelationship it demonstrates between the EH and EC cultures. The earliest deposits at the site come from shal- low depressions in bedrock; the finds are few and are difficult to interpret. The pottery has some resemblance to that from Kephala but tubular lugs are a new feature and some of the shapes are unlike those of Kephala. These deposits should probably be considered later than the time of Kephala and assigned to the period of EB I. Rolled rims do not occur, however, and there is little connection with the Pelos phase in the other Cyclades. The next phase of occupation at Ayia Irini falls within the EB II period; it is represented by ex- tensive remains of houses. The finds are chiefly of mainland type but fragments of painted sauceboats of Cycladic type and a vessel in the form of a bear or hedgehog'15 like one from Syros16' document the close connections of the Syros phase and EH II. A sealing of exceptional interest was found in an EB II deposit; it depicts among other things a sauceboat and a bird. Another group of finds dating to the EBA, the "Temple Lane" group, is stratigraphically later than the EB II deposits. This group includes Ana- tolian types of pottery, depa, and one-handled cups. Both shapes are found in the Syros phase in the other Cyclades: depa in the settlement at Chal- andriani and one-handled cups in graves in Syros and Siphnos. Since, however, no sauceboats are found in the "Temple Lane" group at Keos, it may perhaps be assigned to a stage a little later than that of the Syros phase. A number of shallow bowls or plates have also been found at Ayia Irini in deposits similar to the "Temple Lane" group. One of them is wheel- made."' The plates are generally similar to the wheel-made plates which occur at Troy from the time of Troy II B onwards and also with those which occur in an EB III group of pottery from Lefkandi in Euboia.1'8 There is apparently a differ- ent sequence in Keos and Euboia from that found at Lerna. There wheel-made pottery begins in Lerna IV (i.e. EH III) but the shapes are different from those at Lefkandi and Keos and the wares include Minyan ware."9 To summarize: the Cyclades are now seen to have been inhabited as early as the fifth millennium by a group of people with a culture distinct from but having its closest ties with the mainland of Greece. Towards the middle of the fourth mil- lennium, or the early third millennium, one island at least, Keos, on the northwestern edge of the Cyclades, was occupied by another group of people who had still closer connections with the mainland and especially with Attica. For much of the third millennium a single Early Cycladic culture, in which several more or less distinct phases can be recog- nized, was widespread in the islands. The earliest phase of the EC period, the Pelos phase, can only tentatively be linked with developments in neigh- bouring areas; by the time of the Syros phase, how- ever, there were fairly close interconnections be- tween the islands, the mainland of Greece, and Western Anatolia.
