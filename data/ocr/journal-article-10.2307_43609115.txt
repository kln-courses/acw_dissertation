"Der Ursprung der antiken Olym- pischen Spiele in der Forschung: Versuch eines kritischen Kommen- tars" [The Origin of the Olympic Games According to the Research: A Critical Commentary] Stadion , 6 1 (1980), 1-38. The object of the present study is a critical examination of the current scholarly traditions and methodological positions of the theories relative to the origin of the Olympic Games. The spectrum of authors discussed stretches from P. Leveque and L. Drees to older and currently less respected research- ers such as J. G. Frazer, J. J. Bachofen, J. H. Krause and A. Bockh. Particu- lar attention is paid to attempts to derive the most famous of Panhellenic games from funeral games and the rites of heroes as well as from the holy marriage (hieros gamos), royal inaugurations, and rites of initiation. In addi- tion to these cultic motives, theories of secular origin are also analyzed. Based upon primary sources and secondary works; 116 notes. (Copyright 1981 by Verlag Hans Richarz.

It has been suggested that some of the customs and events associated with the modern Olympic Games were also evident during the ancient Olympic Games. A close examination of selected customs and events reveals that this was sometimes not the case. For example, the torch relay ceremony which is a prominent part of the modern Games does not have its roots in the ancient Games. The first torch ceremony actually took place during the 1936 Berlin Games. The marathon race is another example of mistaken identity. Contrary to popular belief, it was not an event during the ancient Games. Likewise, the popular views that Greek athletes were "pure" amateurs who placed the spirit of participation before winning were also false. The purported Greek ideal of "sport for sport's sake" was really the work of Baron Pierre de Coubertin who founded the modern Games. Based on secondary works. 3 notes. - Robert W.

The notion to excavate Olympia was first put forth during the eighteenth century by Montfaucon (1723). Winckelmann, shortly before he died (1767) also designed a plan of action. One expected to uncover masterpieces of clas- sical art that lay hidden here in unique abundance, according to ancient sources. But only in the nineteenth century were conditions ripe for such plans. In 1875 the German excavations began and by 1881 the center of the sanctuary was unearthed. The German Government covered the costs, and the uncovered artifacts remained in Greece according to the treaty between both countries. After a brief hiatus, the excavations were resumed in 1936 in con- junction with the Berlin Olympics, only to be halted again by World War II. Following the war, archeologists have renewed their efforts at Olympia which continue there today. Based upon primary sources and secondary works; 1 10 notes; 19 photographs.

Most biographers of Pierre de Coubertin agree that he was a historian. The author asserts that this truth has been offered without proof and proposes a scientific approach to Coubertin' s relationship to history and historiography. His evidence is derived from a study of Coubertin 's courses at the university, the influence of his intellectual mentors (Tocqueville, Taine, LePlay), the cat- alog of his library, and a thematic and literary criticism of the historical and pedagogical portions of his published works. The author concludes that Coub- ertin was not a historian in the professional sense, but rather a didactic and moralistic chronicler of current events. For Pierre de Coubertin, history teaches wisdom and diffuses a light which clarifies, beyond any other field of scholarship, the path to be taken by the educator and pedagogical reformer.

The original purposes of the congresses - to give the IOC an additional platform for its ideals and to allow the discussion of pedagogical and educational aspects of modern sports - were abandoned by 1914 as the organizational problems and technical aspects of the Olympic movement took precedence.

The United States in 1906 decided to participate in the unofficial Athens Olympian Games, and in so doing, substantially strengthened the entire Olympic movement. Coubertin's position as leader of the Olympic movement was quite tenuous in these very early days. A minor revolt by some IOC mem- bers, combined with strong Greek national fervor, convinced Coubertin that he should discuss with Greek authorities the possibility of Panhellenic games in Athens - a festival that the French baron perceived as a rival rather than a complement to his quadrennial Olympic Games. Coubertin's antagonist in the United States, the sport leader James E. Sullivan, was the energy behind the USA's decision. American involvement helped turn the Olympic Games around, giving impetus to larger number of participants at the 1908 London games. Based upon primary sources and secondary works; 63 notes.

After rejecting Berlin's bids to host the Olympic Games of 1908 and 1912, the IOC decided in 1912 to award the Vlth games, to be celebrated in 1916, to Berlin. By 1913 the German stadium was already finished. Preliminary games took place in 1914. The organizers hoped to impress visitors with the image of a powerful Germany and to imbue the games with German spirit.

The summer of 1926 marked the 150th birthday of the Declaration of Inde- pendence, and the city of Philadelphia saw as its patriotic duty to celebrate on behalf of the nation by hosting a Sesqui-Centennial Exposition. Along with exhibits of the latest technological advancements, the nation's increasing love affair with sport spectating was manifested by an exposition of sport competi- tions ranging from swimming to a boxing match between Jack Dempsey and Gene Tunney. However, a somewhat overshadowed sporting event was the poorly attended National Junior and Senior AAU Track and Field Champion- ships of 1926. This four-day event witnessed the gathering of 59 men and women who were or would become Olympians. Marathon runner Clarence DeMar and shot-putter, discus, and javelin thrower Lillian Copeland were two examples of the greatest gathering of Olympians who gave record-break- ing performances.

Although female athletes did not participate in the first Olympic Games of the modern era, their involvement in the Games has been an evergrowing pro- cess since their first participation in the Paris Games of 1900. This has oc- curred despite the stiff opposition of the early leaders of the Olympic move- ment, from Coubertin to Brundage, despite the opposition of a large segment of women, and despite the opposition of the Church regarding their involve- ment in sport. In recent years the place of female athletes in the Modern Olympic Games has grown significantly, and today only six Olympic sports are closed to them.

This Olym- pics first saw a 16-year-old Illinois school girl, Elizabeth (Betty to her friends) Robinson, win the 100-meter dash to become the first United States woman to win a gold medal in Olympic track and field. Discovered in the spring of 1928 by assistant track coach Charlie Price while running for a commuter train, Robinson, in only her third track competition ever, qualified for the United States Women's Olympic Team on July 4th of that year. Hopes for repeating her 100-meter Amsterdam performance in the 1932 games were squelched by injuries she received in a 1931 plane crash. Robinson, however, recovered and was named to the 1936 Olympic team. At Berlin she repeated her gold medal performance as a member of the 400-meter relay team. As an Olympic competitor, Robinson won two gold and one silver medal. She is enshrined in several track and field halls of fame and has promoted women's track and field around the world.

Being unable to afford entrance fees, Liu and his coach, Song Junfu, could only attend events in which he was entered. Met with hostility in the Olympic village, Liu remem- bered the Olympics as a bitter experience. Liu was also a member of the 1936 and 1948 Chinese Olympic teams. At the 1948 London Games, the team was stranded without funds to get home and only by selling the rice they brought with them and getting assistance from Chinese living abroad were they able to return to China.

"The Nazi Olympiad," Journal of Health, Physical Education , Recreation and Dance, 55, No. 4 (April 1984), 25-26, 28. The 1936 Berlin Olympiad was perhaps one of the best organized and yet most controversial in history. Adolph Hitler viewed the games as a political tool to be used for internal and external propaganda purposes. It was hoped that by holding a glamorous Olympic spectacle, the Third Reich would gain international legitimacy and acceptance. Because of Nazi anti-Semitic actions and military aggression, the Americans came very close to boycotting the games. Jesse Owens, an American athlete, became the hero of the games with great victories on the athletic field as well as in the political arena. In the final analysis, it appeared that Hitler was somewhat successful in using the games to strengthen his grip over Germany and gain some international respect for his regime.

"Avery Brundage and American Participation in the 1936 Olympic Games," Journal of American Studies , 16 (April 1982), 81-105. Avery Brundage was for forty years the most powerful figure in the Ameri- can and International Olympic movement, first as president of the American Olympic Committee, then as head of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). His role in determining the United States' participation in the 1936 Olympic Games reflected his dualistic position that sports should be free of politics and that American participation in international sport could spread its democratic values and combat communism. Germany had been awarded the Games of the Eleventh Olympiad prior to Hitler's rise to power. The Nazi takeover in 1933 led to an immediate anti-Semitic campaign. Major opposi- tion to allowing Germany to host the Olympics arose in both the IOC and in American sports organizations. The IOC attempted to use the threatened boy- cott of the games to make the Germans observe the Olympic standards of conduct. Brundage blamed the Jews for the boycott move and considered it not in the best interest of American sport or the Jewish cause. Brundage coun- tered every effort to boycott from 1933 until the American team sailed in 85</page><page sequence="8">Journal of Sport History, Vol. 1 1 , No. 3 (Winter, 1984) 1936. Recognizing his contribution to the success of the games and collapse of the boycott, the Germans treated Brundage handsomely. Brundage came away from the games strongly supportive of the Germans and was convinced they were a bulwark against communism. His principal argument against the boycott was that sport and politics should not mix. His own anti-communism was inconsistent with this.

"Das Scheitern der Olympischen Spiele von 1940" [The Demise of the Olympic Games of 1940], Stadion , 6 (1980), 251- 90. The Olympic Games of 1940 were sacrificed to the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Finnish Wars. As Tokyo was forced by the military to renounce the games in the summer of 1938, the IOC awarded the games to Helsinki. The Finns continued to plan for the games during the "Winter War of 1939-1940" and resolved to give up the games only when the Second World War began to escalate. Since the historians of the Olympic movement have neglected this period, research must turn to the sources to reconstruct the particulars of the episode.

For decades authors of American fiction have revered baseball for its purity and symbolism of life's successes and failures. Candelaria surveyed works of ten authors, among them Mark Twain, Ernest Hemingway, and Sinclair Lewis, who, although not writing about baseball, throw baseball around me- taphorically to convey a message. In the works surveyed, each author uses baseball symbolically in one of two ways: nostalgically, as the very metier of the Golden Age in America, and ironically, in order to reveal mundane, re- grettable truths about American culture. Such analysis presents strong support for baseball's importance as a rich symbol of American life. No notes. - Jerry J. Wright II-2 Crepeau, Richard C.

His new team's owner displays all the worst tendencies of those in his position, such as manipulation of people while demanding team loyalty. Willie is startled by and fearful of the oneness of the baseball crowd and the frustrated rage as fans seek a sense of commu- nity with emotional intensity at the sports spectacle. While some fans idolize Willie, others view his perfection as a pitcher as a threat to the true spirit of sport, simply the striving for perfection. When he quits the team to join a seminary, he faces negative reactions centered on his ingratitude racially and monetarily.

The issue of racial discrimination in sport has generated a solid body of literature. In the professional baseball industry two forms of discrimination have been apparent: 44marginality" - the tendency to exclude blacks of mar- ginal ability in favor of whites, and "centrality" - the tendency to exclude qualified black players from positions which involve interaction with and con- trol of the action of teammates. Data from 1960 to 1980 reveal a diminution of marginality, but an increase in centrality. That is, centrality as a form of racial discrimination has increased during the past twenty years. A methodological improvement over prior studies - the use of slugging percentage to measure offensive productivity - is also discussed. (Copyright 1983, Journal of Sport and Social Issues.

And the myth goes on. No notes. - June A. Kennard II-10 Ripley, John W. "Baseball's Greatest Song," American Heritage , 34, No. 4 (June/July 1983), 76-79.

"Origins of the Connection of Physical Education and Athletics, at the American University: An Organizational Interpreta- tion," Journal of Sport and Social Issues, 3, No. 1 (1979), 22-32. Using the "open systems" approach, universities and departments as orga- nizations must acquire resources for survival from the task environment con- sisting of administrators, faculty, students, alumni, and the general public. By expanding athletic programs between 1890-1930, universities profitted mone- tarily, gained visibility, and increased enrollments while providing sports en- tertainment. When faculty opposed athletics as inappropriate to the educa- tional goals of the university, it became essential to defend its program as educational. By linking athletics with departments of physical education, they gained a veneer of justification. The financial stability gained by physical edu- cation carried with it the responsibility to provide proper organizational guid- ance.

"Edward Hitchcock, Jr.: Dean of the Profession," Journal of Physical Education , Recreation and Dance , 53, No. 7 (Oc- tober 1982), 19-21. Edward Hitchcock, M.D., first President of the American Association for the Advancement of Physical Education and Professor of Hygiene and Physi- 90</page><page sequence="13">Journal Surveys cal Education at Amherst College, was an innovator and leader of physical education programming during the latter half of the nineteenth century. Often referred to as the 4 "founder" of physical education in American colleges and universities, his program of light gymnastics included calisthenic type exer- cises performed in unison to music while using dumbbells weighing one or two pounds each. Marching, running or 4 'double-quick' ' movements were also a part of "Doc" Hitchcock's exercise program. His interest in compara- tive anatomy and anthropometry led to the establishment of a large pool of anthropometric measurements that were useful to future generations of physi- cal educators.

"Luther Halsey Gulick, 'He Dreamed Dreams and Made His Dreams Come True,' " Journal of Physical Education , Recre- ation and Dance, 54, No. 8 (October 1983), 69-70, 73. Gulick's professional career including his schooling, the years spent within the YMCA program, the formation of the Public Schools Athletic League, and community recreation programs are discussed. In addition, Gulick's lead- ership within physical education and his general philosophy of life and exer- cise are examined.

"The Turning Point," Journal of Physical Edu- cation, Recreation and Dance, 54, No. 8 (October 1983), 71-73. Luther Halsey Gulick's realization in 1885 that 4 'organized physical educa- tion was every bit as useful in the modern world as organized religion" turned his life around. Prior to that moment, he experienced great self-doubts about himself due to his inability to follow his father into the ministry. With re- newed vigor and direction, he led 44his play organizers in a crusade for 'mus- cular Christianity' that affected almost every dimension of American soci- ety." Applying the ideas and theories of G. Stanley Hall and John Dewey, Gulick brought American physical education into the Progressive Era and rec- reation to the fore of American society during the twentieth century.

"Jesse Feiring Williams: A Philosophical and Historical Review," Journal of Physical Education , Recreation and Dance, 54, No. 1 (January 1983), 16-20. Jesse Feiring Williams (1886-1966) was one of the most influential leaders and prolific writers in the history of American physical education. Between 1916 and 1964, he delivered many speeches, wrote several articles, and au- thored or co-authored 41 books. Influenced by such famous educational theor- ists as John Dewey and William Heard Kilpatrick, Professor Williams sup- 91</page><page sequence="14">Journal of Sport History, Vol. 1 1 , No. 3 (Winter, 1984) ported the notion of education through the physical. He believed that it is the function of education and the role of physical education within it, to prepare the child for life in a democratic society. He also advocated the 4 'whole man" or physical, mental, and social objectives of physical education. According to Williams, beneficial social values can be learned through participation in sports and physical education activities.

"In Memoriam: Elmer Dayton Mitchell (1889-1983)," Journal of Physical Education , Recreation and Dance, 55, No. 1 (January 1984), 60. Elmer Dayton Mitchell, "the father of intramural athletics," was an early leader in the establishment of intramural sport programs in colleges and uni- versities. While serving as Intramural Director at the University of Michigan, Mitchell was an active member of the American Physical Education Associa- tion (now the AAHPERD). He was also editor for both the Journal of Health and Physical Education as well as the Research Quarterly. His extensive writings contributed significantly to the fields of physical education, intramu- rals, and recreation. Before his death in 1983, Mitchell received several pro- fessional honors including the Gulick and Hetherington Awards from the American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance.

The career of Eleanor Metheny, a prominent physical educator, is traced through her early schooling, entry into physical education, and graduate edu- cation. The ideas and theories which influenced her at the University of Chi- cago and later her association with C. H. McCloy are discussed. Many refer- ences are made to writings and speeches. She put forth a great effort in seeking women's equality in all aspects of life, and her theories on human movement are most valuable to physical educators today.
