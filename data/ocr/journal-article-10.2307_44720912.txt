Kent Collision Safety Engineering Charles R. Monson GMH Engineering Copyright 1996 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT Accident data suggest that a significant percentage of rear impacts involve occupants seated in other than a "Normal Seated Position". Pre-impact acceleration due to steering, braking or a prior frontal impact may cause the driver to move away from the seat back prior to impact. Nevertheless, virtually all crash testing is conducted with dummies in the optimum "Normal Dummy Seated Position". A series of 7 rear impact sled tests, having a nominal AV of 21 mph, with Hybrid III dummies positioned in the "Normal Dummy Seated Position", "Out of Position" and slightly "Out of Position" is presented. Tests were performed on yielding production Toyota and Mercedes Benz seats as well as on a much stiffer modified Ford Aerostar seat. Available Hybrid III upper and lower neck as well as torso instrumentation was used to analyze and compare injury potential for each set of test parameters. In all cases, neck forces and moments were found to increase when the dummy's torso was leaned forward at impact. For the out-of-position tests, the results showed that the upper neck loads were clearly related to seat stiffiiess; stiffer seats produced greater neck loading. The lower neck loads, however, showed no definite correlation with seat back stiffiiess. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND Fatalities and serious injuries in rear-end collisions are relatively infrequent; only about four percent of all fatalities result from very severe collisions in this accident mode [James, 1991]. About seventy percent of the societal harm from rear- end collisions is concentrated in much larger numbers of low- level injuries caused in crashes with AV's of less than 20 mph [James, 1996]. Despite the relatively low priority of rear-impact protection compared to other areas of automobile crash protection, and despite the relatively small percentage of harm associated with rear-impact accidents of severity greater than 20 mph, considerable research into improving crash protection in high-severity rear-end impacts is being conducted within the automotive safety community. Proposals that seats should be stiffened to help retain occupants in these high-severity rear-end crashes are countered by concerns that stiffening seat backs will swell the already much larger amassment of harm from the greater number of minor and moderate injuries that occur in lower-severity rear-end impacts [Warner, 1991]. Historically, crash testing of occupant protection concepts has been performed using anthropomorphic test devices (crash dummies) which are placed and postured in what is designated the Normal Dummy Seated Position (NDSP). In this NDSP, the dummy sits in an erect posture with its buttocks squarely on the seat and its shoulder blades flush against the seat back. For a single-occupant seat, the head and chest are laterally centered on the headrest and seat back, respectively. Any positioning other than the NDSP can be thought of as Out-of-Position (OOP). Except for a 1994 study at Collision Safety Engineering and a few unintentional exceptions [Strother, 1994], virtually all rear- impact experiments reported in the literature have been conducted with the dummies in the NDSP. This is consistent with the need for standardized test protocols to facilitate performance measurement, maximize test repeatability, and improve comparison between tests. Exclusive NDSP testing may be inconsistent, however, with the need to gain a comprehensive understanding of the most effective methods of protecting occupants in rear-end impacts within the real-life environment. The Normal Seated Position (NSP), with the occupant's head in close proximity to the head restraint, is coincidentally the optimal position for occupant injury protection in rear-end impact, an intuitive fact demonstrated by the measured increase in injury levels for the few OOP tests that have been performed [Strother, 1994]. Data from the National Accident Sampling System (NASS) suggest that pre-impact vehicle motions in a significant percentage of rear-impacts may cause many accident victims to not be in the NSP when the impact occurs, even if they happened to be in such a position at the onset of the accident. Many occupants would be involuntarily moved from their initial positions by accelerations caused by abrupt pre-impact braking and/or steering. Rear impacts often happen because the vehicle in front did something unexpected, such as slamming on brakes, hitting the next car in front, or cutting in from another lane. Such actions logically lead to driver responses that tend to move occupants from their initial seated positions. Other studies have focused on voluntary causes for occupants in rear-impacted automobiles to not be in the NSP. Mackay, et al found that people don't sit in cars the way dummies do, even when driving straight down the road, looking 1958</page><page sequence="2">straight ahead [Mackay, 1995]. They found that drivers generally sit further forward in their seats than do crash dummies in the NDSP. This difference was particularly pronounced for small females, who were found to sit with their heads about three-and-a-half inches further forward than the corresponding crash test dummies. Of the population of drivers studied, nearly 50% sat with their heads six inches or more forward of their head restraints while driving straight down the road. Personal observation and experience suggest several additional reasons for occupants of automobiles to be out-of- position, aside from the simple fact that they may not be comfortable sitting erect in the NDSP, especially for long periods of time. They may be taking advantage of being stopped at an intersection to stretch and readjust their position, or to retrieve something from a purse or bag or from the glove box. They may be reaching for controls, such as the tape player or air conditioner. They may be shifting gears with a manual stick shift. They may be interacting with children in the rear or passenger-side seat. They may have their head turned looking in the rearview mirror or talking with other occupants in the car or someone at the intersection. They may be adjusting their clothing. A study made by the authors at partially obstructed intersections found it very common for people to lean forward several inches to see around the obstructions before proceeding into traffic. There are obviously numerous causes for occupants to not be in the NSP. That occupants may not be in the optimum restraint position is a fact that was recognized in the mid-1970's during research into passive frontal impact protection. Early air cushion restraint systems that ignored the out-of-position problem were later found to need modification in order to not increase injury levels to out-of-position occupants in near-threshold-deployment levels of frontal impact. Indeed, even some front passenger air bag systems built today may be overly aggressive when deployed to protect an occupant pitched forward by pre-impact braking, or when deployed into a child sitting on the edge of the seat. Hopefully, the lessons learned during these development years will not be ignored by those proposing dramatic seat redesigns. Neglect of the OOP problem when evaluating seat designs for occupant protection in rear impacts may result in designs that have the potential to increase the overall harm caused by this accident mode. As is shown in the few OOP tests that have been performed, there can be significant differences between the NDSP and the OOP dummy responses and injury measurements [Strother, 1994]. PURPOSE OF STUDY The purpose of this study was to examine and quantify occupant response data, as a function of seat back stiffness, experienced by a 50 th percentile Hybrid III male anthropomorphic test dummy in a rear end collision. Upper and lower neck forces and moments will be examined for two different seated positions: the out-of-position (OOP) where the dummy was pitched forward and his head was 20 inches from the head restraint and also the normal dummy seated position (NDSP). Automobile seats with markedly different seat back stiffnesses were used in this examination - two production automobile seats and one modified seat that has been proposed as an improvement in rear-impact protection [Saczalski, 1993]. TEST METHODOLOGY Tests were carried out with the seats mounted to a sled which was impacted into a fixed barrier at a nominal speed of 19 mph, resulting in a AV of approximately 21 mph. As depicted in Figure 1, 86% of AIS 0-3 injuries occur at speeds less than 20 mph, while only about 27% of AIS 4-6 (severe or greater) injuries occur in the 0-20 mph speed range [James, 1996]. 100% Jt · - * 90% f 80% J -7^- § φ 70% / -J- / φ / / I 60% ---J-- J. 50% -L -1- - ♦ - MAISOŠI ω -, / / ■ MAIS 4-6 &gt; 40% -, / 7^ ω / " * * Α" I 30% V 4^ : ο 20% ρΑ -7^- 10% - -7^- 0% if- m- o 10 20 30 40 50 60 Delta V (mph) Figure 1 : Delta V vs MAIS, NASS 82-86, CDS 88-94; Rear Damaged Light Vehicles; Front Outboard Occupants, Ages 12+ The sled tests were performed at the Collision Safety Engineering crash test facility according to the overall methodology outlined in a paper by Strother in 1994. [Strother, 1994]. A Hybrid III 50th percentile male anthropomorphic test device (ATD) was placed in each seat with the following instrumentation: Upper neck tension-compression force, Fz ; Upper neck shear force, Fx ; Upper neck extension/flexion moment, MY ; Lower neck tension-compression force, Fz ; Lower neck shear force, Fx ; Lower neck extension/flexion moment, MY ; Lumbar tension-compression force, Fz ; Lumbar shear force, Fx ; Lumbar extension/flexion moment, MY ; Head Acceleration, Gx, GY, and Gz ; Thorax Acceleration in the mid-sagittal plane, Gx and Gz . For the OOP tests the Hybrid III dummy was pitched forward with his buttocks still correctly positioned in the seat cushion. A light weight string tether around the neck helped maintain a distance of 20 inches from the back of the head to the head restraint in all out-of-position tests. The two production seats selected were driver's seats from a 1989 Toyota Corolla and a 1985 Mercedes 190E. The "limited-yield" seat was a 1988 Ford Aerostar driver's seat modified to render it very stiff as compared with the production seats. The seat in each of the tests was placed in the mid- position and the seat back angle was adjusted to 1 5 degrees. The inboard as well as the outboard aft edges were measured pre and 1959</page><page sequence="3">post impact in order to document residual deformation. The static seat pull characteristics of these seats are presented in Table 1. As can be seen, the modified seat represents a significant increase in seat back stiflhess, strength and energy absorption capability over the production seats.

TEST S3 - Normal Dummy Seated Position: This test was conducted with the back of the dummy against the seat back at impact. In this position, the back of the head was about 4.25 inches forward of the leading surface of the head restraint. Figure 3a through 3f are photographs taken from the high speed film showing the motion of the ATD and seat during the test. Figure 3a is the photograph taken at time zero, the instant that the sled carriage contacts the fixed barrier. Figure 3b was taken at 46 ms into the event, corresponding to initial rearward seat back deformation. The chest acceleration has reached about 10 g at this point, and the lower neck extension torque is just starting to increase. Note that the head has yet to contact the head restraint. Figure 3 c is at about 60 ms, at which time seat back deformation temporarily ceases. The lower neck extension torque is continuing to rise at the same steady rate started at about 46 ms. There is still no head contact with the head restraint at this time. Figure 3d is taken at about 70 ms into the event. At this time, the dummy's head contacts the head restraint and the seat back deformation resumes. Figure 3e is at 76 ms, at which time the extension torque in the lower neck reaches a peak of about 1226 in-lbf (very nearly reaching the 1240 in-lbf injury limit). Note that at this time the head is in good alignment with the torso. The last photograph in this series is Figure 3f, taken at 100 ms. The seat back dynamic deformation has reached its maximum value of about 7 deg; the seat back would be reclined a maximum of about 22 deg. From this position the seat back rebounds, pitching the dummy forward into the shoulder belt. TEST S2 - Torso Pitched Forward Slightly: This test was conducted under the same conditions as Test S3, except that the torso of the dummy was leaned forward in the seat slightly, so that the displacement between the back of the head and the leading edge of the head restraint was about 6 inches. At about 46 ms into the event, the dummy's shoulders are into the seat back and the first phase of seat back deformation begins. The torso deceleration has reached about 1 1 or 12 g at this time. At about 60 ms, the seat back deformation is temporarily halted. It is about this time that the dummy's head first contacts the head restraint. At about 80 ms into the crash, Table 2: Summary of Test Results (*Head Z-axis accelerometer failed) Peak ' S1 S2 S3 Ml M2 TI T2 Stat Injury Criteria Measurement units Lo Hi Lo Hi Lo Hi Lo Hi Lo Hi Lo Hi Lo Hi Lo H' Upper Neck Fx (Ibf) -233 112 -114 52 -50 23 -56 67 -33 24 -108 31 -18 23 -697 697 Upper Neck Fz (Ibf) -60 ¿37 -32 450 -33 389 -46 809 -49 332 -106 737 -37 416 -899 742 Upper Neck My (in-lbf) -6Ś2 596 -293 241 -65 113 -261 451 -172 93 -329 571 -89 92 -505 1684 Lower Neck Fx (Ibf) -117 196 -51 208 -30 147 -65 483 -35 163 -87 219 -15 197 -697 697 Lower Neck Fz (Ibf) -99 690 -31 387 -43 353 -81 523 -81 245 -80 408 :61 365 -899 742 Lower Neck My (in-lbf) 913 ΜτΜ 617 -1226 410 Ml 385 Mi 320 W&amp;&amp; 963 WÏÏ&amp; 134 -1240 2200 Lumbar Fx (Ibf) -129 487 -89 95 -44 88 -211 302 -76 96 -114 389 -63 114 -2401 2401 Lumbar Fz (Ibf) -156 578 -167 529 -196 399 -322 649 -304 704 -247 450 -126 546 -1571 2850 Lumbar My (in-lbf) -2241 701 -559 416 -712 332 -1561 508 -994 502 -1905 101 -1254 230 -3269 10912 Peak Head Accel (g) * 50 38 57 26 52 30 Peak Thorax Accel (g) 29 27 22 21 17 26 15 60 HIC Í36ms) # 319 149 451 59 437 61 1000 1960</page><page sequence="4">A: t = 0 msec Initial contact Seat back angle 1 5 ° B: t = 46 msec Seat back begins rearward deformation Chest acceleration at 10 g's Lower neck extension starting to increase C: t = 60 msec Seat back deformation temporarily ceases Lower neck extension torque continues to rise D: t = 90 msec Dummy's head contacts restraint Seat back deformation resumes E: t = 76 msec Extension torque in lower neck peaks at 1226 in-lbf F : t = 100 msec Dynamic seat back deflection ~ 7 ° Figure 3: (TEST S3 - Modified Aerostar Seat ) - Normal Dummy Seated Position 1961</page><page sequence="5">the extension moment in the lower neck has reached a maximum of about 1720 in-lbf (exceeding the 1240 in-lbf injury criterion). Again at this time, the head and torso are in reasonably good alignment, with only a slight extension angle evidenced. At 92 ms into the event, the dummy has attained its maximum rearward excursion with little or no seat deformation over that achieved during the 46-60 ms time frame. The seat back recline is estimated from the high speed film at about 22-23 degrees (estimated dynamic seat back deflection of about 7-8 degrees). Finally, at 180 ms, the seat back has sprung forward, recovering a significant portion of its dynamic deformation and propelling the upper body of the dummy forward and slightly upward to re- encounter the shoulder belt. The measured residual seat back deformation was about 4 degrees. TEST SI - Torso Pitched Forward: This sled test was conducted under the conditions of Tests S3 and S2, except that the torso of the dummy was pitched forward in a more pronounced attitude. In this position, the back of the head was about 20 inches forward of the head restraint. Figures 4a through 4f document the overall response of the dummy and seat in this test. Figure 4a is a photograph taken at the onset of the impact. Comparing this photo with Figure 3 a, the difference in dummy positioning is clearly seen. Figure 4b is taken at about 62 ms, at which time the seat back yielding begins. The onset of seat deformation occurs later in this test compared with Tests S2 and S3 because of the greater movement required under this condition to place the shoulders of the dummy against the seat back. Figure 4c is at about 72 ms into the crash, at which time the seat back deformation stops. The seat back recline at this instant is estimated from the high speed film at about 23 deg, which would correspond to about 8 degrees of dynamic seat back deflection. As can be seen in this photo, the head is still some distance forward of the head restraint when seat back yield ceases. Figure 4d is at about 100 ms. It is around this time that the tension loads and the neck extension torque in the upper neck, as well as the extension torque in the lower neck begin their climb to values exceeding the injury criteria. Figure 4e is a photograph taken at about 1 14 ms into the impact - this is the instant where the upper neck tension and the upper and lower neck extension torques reach their above-criteria peak values. Again, the head is in only slight extension at this time. Maximum head extension, in fact, occurs at about 130 ms (Figure 4f) and appears to be less than 45 degrees. From this position, the dummy is thrown forward and slightly upward as energy stored in the seat back is released. About 3 degrees of residual seat back deformation was measured in this test. SUMMARY - SLED TESTS WITH THE MODIFIED AEROSTAR SEATS Three sled tests were conducted using the modified Aerostar seats. The dummy position was varied in these tests from the Normal Dummy Seated Position (Test S3) to a position slightly pitched forward (Test S2), and then to a position where the torso is pitched forward to where the head was about 15-16 inches forward of its NDSP position (Test SI). In the NDSP test, the dummy lower neck extension moment approached the limiting value for likelihood of injury. Only a slightly different head position in Test S2 relative to that of the NDSP test (Test S3) resulted in about a 50 percent increase in the neck torques, thereby exceeding the injury criterion. With the dummy leaned about 15-16 inches forward of its NDSP at impact (Test SI), the lower neck moment measurement increased markedly, well beyond the injury threshold. In this case, the tension force in the upper neck (937 lbf) also exceeded its respective injury criterion (742 lbf). TESTS WITH THE MERCEDES SEAT Two Mercedes seats were tested, one in the Normal Dummy Seated Position (NDSP), and one with the dummy pitched forward (OOP) at impact. TEST M2 - Normal Dummy Seated Position: Test M2 was conducted with the Mercedes seat with the anthropomorphic dummy in the Normal Dummy Seated Position (NDSP). In this position, the dummy's shoulders are firmly against the seat back, and the back of the dummy's head is about 2 inches forward and upward from the front surface of the head restraint. Figures 5a through 5f document the response of the dummy and the seat during this test. Figure 5a is at the onset of the deceleration, i.e. at time zero. The seat back is positioned in the erect position so that the initial seat back recline is about 15 deg. In Figure 5b, at time 36 ms, the seat back is just beginning to yield rearward. The chest A-P acceleration is climbing up to a plateau of about 7.5 g, which will be reached at about 48 ms into the event. In Figure 5c, at 124 ms, the head just contacts the head restraint as seat back yield continues in the upper portion of the seat back frame. In Figure 5d, at 132 ms, the lower neck extension moment enters a period of relatively rapid increase, reaching a peak of 1269 in-lbf at about 142 ms, Figure 5e. This torque level is just above the criterion value of 1240 in-lbf. Finally, at about 180 ms, the yielding of the upper portion of the seat back ceases and the dummy begins its rebound phase of motion (Figure 5f). The maximum head extension angle occurs at about this time. As measured from the high-speed film, the seat back attains a maximum angle of about 50 degrees (outboard side) to 57 degrees (inboard side) for a maximum dynamic deflection of about 35-42 degrees. A residual seat back angle of about 50.6 degrees was measured on the inboard side of the seat post- impact indicating a recovery of approximately 7 degrees. TEST Ml - Torso Pitched Forward: Test Ml was conducted under the same conditions as Test SI except that the Mercedes seat was employed rather than the modified Aerostar seat. That is, the dummy torso was pitched forward so that, at impact, the back of the head was about 20 inches forward of the head restraint and about 1 8 inches 1962</page><page sequence="6">A: t = 0 msec Initial contact Seat back angle 1 5 ° D: t = 100 msec Upper neck tension and extension begin climbing B: t = 62 msec Seat back begins to yield E:t= 114 msec Injury criteria values are exceeded in the upper neck tension and upper and lower neck extension torques C'A = 12 msec Seat back deformation stops Seat back angle at ~ 23 ° F: t = 130 msec Maximum head extension Figure 4: (TEST SI - Modified Aerostar Seat ) - Out-of-Position 1963</page><page sequence="7">A: t = 0 msec Initial contact Seat back angle 1 5 ° B: t = 36 msec Seat back begins to yield Chest acceleration 7.5 g's C: t = 124 msec Head contacts head restraint Seat back yield continues D: t = 132 msec Lower neck extension values increase rapidly E: t = 142 msec Lower neck extension peaks at 1269 in-lbf F: t= 180 msec Seat yielding ceases, dummy begins rebound Maximum head extension Dynamic seat back deflection to ~ 35-42° Figure 5: (TEST M2 - Mercedes Seat) - Normal Dummy Seated Position 1964</page><page sequence="8">A: t = 0 msec initial contact Seat back angle 1 5 0 B: t = 70 msec Shoulders have reached seat back Seat back begins to yield C: t = 100 msec Seat back yield ceases D: t = 108 msec Dummy's head rotated into contact with head restraint Second phase of seat back yield begins E: t = 150 msec Seat back yielding ceases Maximum dynamic seat back deformation at -45° F: t = 400 msec Rebound phase Figure 6: (TEST Ml - Mercedes Seat) - Out-of-Position 1965</page><page sequence="9">forward of its NDSP. Figures 6a through 6f illustrate the dummy kinematics and seat response during this test. Figure 6a is taken at the initiation of the impact. Comparing this photo with Figure 5a, one can see the similarity in dummy pre-impact positioning. Figure 6b is at about 70 ms into the event, at which time the shoulder area of the dummy torso has reached the seat back and the seat back starts its initial phase of rearward yield. During this first phase of seat back yield, the upper neck tension force and the lower neck extension moment start increasing (i.e. at about 75-80 ms). Figure 6c is taken about 100 ms into the impact, the time at which this initial phase of seat back yield is over. At about 108 ms (Figure 6d), the dummy's head has rotated into contact with the head restraint and the second phase of seat back yield starts. This second phase of seat back deformation lasts until about 150 ms (Figure 6e), at which time the seat attains its maximum dynamic seat back angle of about 45 degrees (for a maximum dynamic seat back yield of about 30 deg). During this time period, i.e. around 125 ms, the upper neck tension force and the lower neck extension moment reach peaks that exceed their respective injury criteria. Figure 6f is taken at about 400 ms into the event, at which time the dummy is reacting to the release of energy stored in the seat back by rebounding upward and forward. About 17 degrees of permanent seat back deformation was measured after this test. SUMMARY OF TESTS WITH THE MERCEDES SEATS Two tests were conducted with the Mercedes seats; one test with the ATD in the Normal Dummy Seated Position (Test M2), and the other test with the dummy torso pitched forward at impact. In both tests, the lower neck extension moment exceeded the injury criterion. In addition, during the OOP test, the upper neck tension reached a peak of just over 800 lbf, exceeding the injury criterion of 742 lbf. A comparison of the neck forces and torques achieved with the Mercedes seat and those achieved by the modified Aerostar seat, indicates that the forces and torques are comparable, despite the fact that the permanent deformations of the Mercedes seats were significantly greater than those of the modified Aerostar seats. Interestingly, the residual seat deformations were greater in the tests with the NDSP dummies as compared with those experienced in the OOP tests. TESTS WITH THE TOYOTA SEAT Two Toyota seats were tested, one in the Normal Dummy Seated Position (NDSP), and one with the dummy pitched forward (OOP) at impact. TEST T2 - Normal Dummy Seated Position; TestT2 was conducted using the Toyota seat, with the anthropomorphic dummy in the Normal Dummy Seated Position. With the shoulder area of the dummy pressed against the seat back, this puts the rear surface of the head about 1 y2 inches forward and slightly up from the leading surface of the head restraint. Figures 7a through 7f document the response of the dummy and seat in this test. Figure 7a is at the initiation of the impact. Figure 7b is taken at 40 ms into the event, at which time the seat back begins yielding. The A-P chest deceleration has increased to about 10 g at this point in time, and the onset of seat back deformation is accompanied by a temporary drop in chest deceleration, which returns to the 10 g level at about 50 ms, climbing slightly thereafter. Figure 7c is at 110 ms, at which time the head contacts the head restraint. It is at this time that the lower neck extension moment begins to rise more rapidly to its peak of 1474 in- Ibf at about 130 ms (Figure 7d). At about 150 ms the seat back yield ceases as the seat back attains its peak deflection. From film analysis, it is estimated that the maximum seat back angle attained was approximately 60 deg (Figure 7e). With an initial recline of 15 deg, this would correspond to about 45 degrees of dynamic seat back deformation. Post impact seat back recline angle was measured at 60 deg, indicating little seat back recovery. TEST T1 - Torso Pitched Forward: Test T1 was conducted using the Toyota seat under the same conditions as Tests SI and Ml, with the dummy torso pitched forward at impact. Figures 8a through 8f document the dummy kinematics and seat response for this test. Figure 8a is at time zero and Figure 8b is at about 60 ms when the seat back deformation begins. In Figure 8c, at 1 30 ms, the head first contacts the head rest. During the period between Figures 8c and 8d the lower neck extension torque begins to increase. In Figure 8d, at 140 ms, this extension torque reaches a maximum of about 2959 in-lbf, well above the 1240 in-lbf criterion and at a level comparable to that in the other OOP tests with the modified Aerostar seat and the Mercedes seat. At 170 ms into the event, Figure 8e, the seat back attains its maximum deformation, with the backrest tilted rearward at about a 45 degree angle, corresponding to about 30 degrees of dynamic seat back deformation. As can be seen in Figures 8d and 8e, the head and neck extension is not excessive in this test. Finally, in Figure 8f, the dummy is undergoing its mild rebound motion during seat back unloading. The residual seat back recline measured after the test was about 40 deg, indicating about 5 degrees of seat back angle recovery. SUMMARY OF TESTS CONDUCTED WITH THE TOYOTA SEATS Two tests were conducted with the Toyota seats, one with the dummy in the Normal Dummy Seated Position and the other with the dummy torso pitched forward at impact. Looking first at the test in the NDSP, the resulting neck forces and torques in this test (T2) are comparable to those obtained in the earlier tests with the modified Aerostar seat and the Mercedes seat. Examining the tests conducted with the dummy torso pitched forward at impact, the neck loads sustained by the dummy in the Toyota seat are lower than those sustained by the dummy seated in the other two seats.

DISCUSSION OF TEST RESULTS On the basis of the seven tests conducted during this program it appears that, if one ignores the slightly excessive lower neck extension torques (relative to the accepted injury criteria [Mertz, 1968]), these three seat designs are capable of providing reasonable protection to a belted 50th percentile male occupant in a nominally 21 mph AV rear impact where that occupant is in the Normal Dummy Seated Position. When the occupant's upper torso is pitched forward at the instant of impact, however, neck forces and moments increase. This increase is relatively more dramatic as seat stiffness increases, with greater loads produced by stiffer seats. In fact, when the dummy head was simply moved forward less than 2 inches relative to the NDSP, the dummy in the modified Aerostar seat sustained an increase in the lower neck extension torque of almost 50 percent (from 1226 in-lbfto 1720 in-lbf). Figure 9 shows the measured upper-neck compression and tension loads as functions of the time duration for which the measurements exceeded the plotted values. The time duration-dependant injury criteria for tension and compression of the 50th percentile male upper neck are also plotted for comparison. Tests SI (Modified Aerostar Seat), Ml (Mercedes Seat) and T1 (Toyota Seat) have been plotted such that occupant response as a function of the seat stiffness could be examined. A similar plot is presented in Figure 10 which shows the measured upper-neck fore-aft shear loads and corresponding 50th percentile male injury Figure 9: Upper Neck Axial Loads for Tests SI, Ml, &amp; T1 Figure 10: Upper Neck Shear Loads for Tests SI, Ml &amp; T1 Figure 1 1 : Upper Neck Moment Loads for Tests S 1 , M 1 &amp; Tl criteria for the same three out-of-position tests [Melvin, 1985]. Finally, Figure 11 plots the upper neck moment loads and corresponding injury criteria. It is seen that the stiff modified Aerostar seat produced the greatest upper neck loads for each of the measured modes. This difference is especially remarkable in the neck extension measurements, where the modified Aerostar values are approximately twice those of the two production seats. Figures 12, 13 and 14 are data observed in the lower neck for the axial loads, shear loads, and moment loads 1969</page><page sequence="13">Figure 12: Lower Neck Axial Loads for Tests SI, Ml &amp; T1 Figure 13: Lower Neck Shear Loads for Tests SI, Ml &amp; T1 respectively. In contrast to the upper neck loads, the lower neck loads show no clear correlation with seat stiflhess. As can be seen in Figure 14, in all the OOP tests the lower neck extension torques exceeded the injury criterion by a substantial margin, including those in the test with the relatively less stiff Toyota seat. Since this criterion was exceeded by such a wide margin, either these values suggest very real injury potential, or the injury criterion is too conservative. Moreover, given the fact that these seats have significantly different stiflhess properties, it seems that the magnitude of these lower neck torques are somewhat Figure 14: Lower Neck Moment Loads for Tests SI, Ml &amp; T1 independent of seat properties; they are certainly not a function of the magnitude of seat deformation. Interestingly, none of the test dummies underwent any extreme hyperextension in any of these tests and the timing of the peak of the lower neck extension moment did not correspond to either the instant of maximum neck extension or the instant of maximum dummy and seat displacement. This demonstrates the inadequacy of evaluating injury potential by simple visual examination of crash-test films without adequate proper dummy neck instrumentation. To the extent that research efforts are focused on the relatively low-priority area of rear impact protection, further research may be warranted to determine a more appropriate lower neck torque injury criterion and to determine whether or not occupants pitched forward at the instant of rear impact are exposed to any significant lower neck trauma. If it is determined that they are, then perhaps a novel seat design concept like the "catcher's mitt" seat developed by General Motors will show some advantage in this regard. For all of the seats tested, there was more seat deformation in the tests conducted with the dummy in the Normal Dummy Seated Position as compared to that sustained in tests with the dummy torso pitched forward at impact. This seems counter-intuitive, since relative velocity between the upper body and seat back is allowed to build up in the OOP tests before contact, seemly requiring additional seat back energy absorption. What appears to happen, however, is that during the period of time wherein the torso is rotating into contact with the seat back, ride down energy is being absorbed by the dummy without causing seat back deformation, since the loads into the seat back are occurring relatively close to the seat back anchorage system. 1970</page><page sequence="14">REFERENCES [James, 1996] James, Michael Β., et. al; "Severe and Fatal Injuries in Rear-End Impacts"; to be published.
