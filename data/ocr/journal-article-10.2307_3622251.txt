<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME ASPECTS OF KARAITE-RABBANITE RELATIONS IN BYZANTIUM ON THE EVE OF THE FIRST CRUSADE By Zvi ANKORI The Jewish Theological Seminary, New York City PART I 1. The graduation of the Byzantine-Karaite society into articu- late maturity can be placed in the mid-forties of the eleventh century, when what seems to have developed into an intelligent and far-sighted leadership on a nation-wide scale was shaping up under the guidance of Tobias ben Moses, called the Servant or the Translator.' This event - or, rather, the eventful period commencing with it, in which institutional forms were molded, an unprecedented Hebrew translation-activity of Karaite literary treasures was set into motion, and policies were laid down that proved to be of far-reaching consequence for the future of the sect - was, at once, an end and a beginning. The end it was and, indeed, the consummation of a twin- process that had already set in in the tenth century, and in which the Karaite story presents a few subsidiary lines only, etched on the tablets of general-Jewish history.2 Thus, on one hand, the I For a resume of the literary activity of this scholar see S. Poznanski, O.ar Yisrael, V, 12a-14a. A revised chronology, placing the rise of Tobias to independent leadership of Byzantine Karaism some time after 1041 C. E., but prior to 1048, has been proposed in my "The Correspondence of Tobias ben Moses the Karaite of Constantinople," Salo Baron Jubilee Volume. Cf. also the critique of a late tradition with regard to Tobias, as expounded in my Hebrew "Elijah Bashyachi: An Inquiry into His Traditions Concerning the Beginnings of Karaism in Byzantium," Tarbiz, XXV (1955-6). 2The basic principle, governing the political history of the Karaites within the framework of general-Jewish history, was laid down first by P.

Mann, Texts and Studies, II, Preface. A restatement of this as well as an exposition of many other a principle pertaining to the essential similarity of political, social and economic processes, working within the Karaite society of the period under review, to those operating in Jewry at large, were undertaken in Chapter I of my doctoral dissertation, "A History of the Karaites in the Byzantine Empire." R. Mahler's admission, in his Karaimer, Chapter X, that "there was no basic difference in the eleventh century between the social structure of the Karaites and that of the Rabbanites," exempts me from taking issue, within the chronology of Byzantine Karaism to which this study is devoted, with his thesis that social protest and the class-identity of its bearers formed one of the twin- motives of the Karaite movement. For the other alleged motive, viz. nationalism, see note 47 to my "The Correspondence etc." (cited in the previous note). 3 For the story of what G. Ostrogorsky termed "the era of conquests" (Geschichte des Byzantinischen Staates, 2nd ed., 228 ff.), which actually started with the exploits of Curcuas, back in the times of Romanus I Lecapenus (cf. A. Vasiliev, Cambridge Medieval History, IV, 307; S. Runciman, The Emperor Romanus Lecapenus and His Reign, 142 ff., 241 f.), and culminated in the victories of Nicephorus Phocas and John Tzimiskes, see G.

Nor is it surprising that the earliest Genizah-record of the existence of Karaites in Byzantium mentions Karaite (alongside of Rabbanite) merchants from the great Byzantine harbor-city of Attaleia, in Asia Minor, en route to Fatimid Egypt,5 or that there were also Karaites in Cyprus, the interim station on that vital navigation span linking the northern and southern shores of the East-Mediterranean basin.6 The peculiar nature and needs 4 On these new Themes (i. e. provincial administrative-military structures), see Ostrogorsky, ibid., 251, and the map of the eastern territories there.

At the same time, commercial provisions in the agreements between the conquering Empire and the now vassal Muslim principalities, prevented the earlier upstream caravan- route from the Persian Gulf as well as the road connecting the Euphrates with Antioch (the latter now firmly in Byzantine hands) from falling in complete disuse.

On the other hand, however, the subsequent steady narrowing of such avenues of international trade that were hitherto open to the Jews, and the consequent unrelenting contraction of Jewish commercial enterprise into the involuntary boundaries of a local or, at best, regional market instead, in the wake of the ascendancy of the Italian maritime republics" and the resurgence of piracy in the East-Mediterranean waters,'2 were- in Byzan- tium perhaps more even than in any Near-Eastern Islamic country - a mighty propelling force in the rise of an indigenous Karaite leadership in the eleventh century. This new economic turn was, in fact, merely lending additional impetus to the sense of self-awareness and of profound inward transformation that the third and fourth generation of Karaites in the Byzantine Empire were experiencing. The grandsons and great-grandsons of the erstwhile Arabic-speaking Karaite newcomers to Christian By- zantium may be expected now - in the shrinking horizon of Byzantine-Jewish economy, and in the face of the general dis- integration of once-powerful central agencies of Jewish self- government in the old-Islamic world and the progressive gaon Solomon b.

Venice, forms an integral part of the decline and fall of the Empire. The reader will find it treated, in one way or another, in all the standard histories referred to in our previous notes. 12 See the references in note 5, above. In fact, it is to the intercommunal correspondence, resulting from the upsurge of piracy, that we owe our earliest record of Karaites in Byzantium: the specific mention of Karaite captives in the epistle yielded by the Genizah was meant to assure favorable partic- ipation of the wealthy Karaite notables of Fustat in the general-Jewish fund-raising campaign that was launched for the sake of ransoming the prisoners from the hands of their Muslim captors.</page><page sequence="6">emergence of Rabbanite provincial leadership everywhere'3 - to have become ever more sensitive to regional Jewish needs and interests of the country that was now theirs by birthright and which they felt themselves well-integrated with linguistically and culturally. They, the adherents of a sect that was a product of an Islamic environment, could not help taking stock of a situa- tion that was as real as it was precarious, and in which their native Greek, as a vehicle of communication and a manifestation of culture, was steadily pushing the traditional Arabianized models of Karaite literature and thought out of their daily life.14 True, they remained genuinely and unswervingly loyal to their religio-spiritual ideal, embodied in the living example of the Arabic-speaking Abel-.Siyyon in Jerusalem; they humbly ac- cepted the latter's tutelage in matters of law and sent their sons to Palestine to sit at the feet of the saintly masters. Still, they could not evade being self-conscious of the carry-overs of politico-cultural alienism, which, though not inherent, so they felt, in the basic premises of their creed, was lingering on in their make-up, incompatible with the climate of the Christian state that was their home now and inexplicable from within the social and intellectual context of their present position.Is Thus the mid-forties of the eleventh century, which brought the formative process of Byzantine Karaism to a close, mark also a beginning - the beginning of a protracted struggle for self-assertion and of a conscious effort on the part of local Karaite leadership to forge ways and means for adapting the sectarian mode of life to the different (Byzantine) conditions with the least detriment to essentials of faith and practice. It is not surprising that precisely from the ranks of students hailing from Byzantium to Jerusalem and returning home, intoxicated with the zeal of the "Mourners of Zion" and re-dedicated to their sect's cause after having mastered Karaite doctrine and exegesis '3 Cf. the paragraph on "Progressive Decentralization" in Baron, op. cit., I, 331 ff., as well as the paragraphs "Provincial Leadership" and "Progressive Self-determination" in his The Jewish Community, I, 187 ff. and 206 f., resp.

The ultimate nature of the Byzantine-Karaite adjustments does, in spite of their elusiveness in the dreary pathways of a seemingly unisonous literature, become more and more manifest to the critical eye when we progress through the centuries. The initial character, however, of those inevitable compromises and modifications, dictated by realities of life in a new environment and under changed economic conditions, is hard to fathom. Nevertheless, we shall not go wrong in venturing the assumption, that, while clinging to essential divergencies in ritual, the Kara- ite minority gradually absorbed certain customs and usages developed by its Rabbanite neighbors, whose experience on Byzantine soil dated back to the very early ages of the Christian era.'6 In the course of time, genuinely new practices and a characteristic new slant in the mode of thinking might have also developed as result of conditions prevailing in the country and under the ever-growing impact of linguistic and cultural integra- tion of Karaite intelligentsia in the Empire's heterogeneous society. This process of adjustment had its dangers, of course, for the demarcation-line between the two branches of Judaism, strug- gling under the same conditions, tended to wear quite thin, at times, in the eyes of some none-too-scrupulous, or ignorant, members of the Karaite community. Thus, a word of caution by an anonymous Byzantine-Karaite conservative in 1088 C. E., whether based on older material, as most Byzantine-Karaite writings are, or indeed original in its apparent simplicity, did not seem superfluous:I7 I6 On the early history of the Jewish communities in the Byzantine Empire see in general S. Krauss, Studien zur Byzantinisch-Judischen Geschichte. 17 See the excerpts and discussion in S. Pinsker's Litut(e Kadmoniyoth, App. VII, 71 ff. The date of the book can indirectly be inferred from the text, where more than once the author recalls the lapse of 1020 years since Roman 7</page><page sequence="8">8 ANKORI [8] And know, that the Rabbanites allow two brothers to marry two sisters . . . and they practice a lot of things that are neither identical with, nor similar to, [Karaite obser- vances] but rather alien [to them], which goes to prove that their custom has led them astray onto an unpaved road; may God enlighten our eyes in the path of truth, Amen.'8 That some Karaites did in fact overstep the boundaries of constructive adjustment and imitated the Rabbanites to the point of self-effacement, seems to follow from the bitter indict- ment voiced by the just-quoted Anonymus. Expatiating on a verse of Leviticus in the familiar medieval vein of translating biblical phrases into allusions to contemporary events, he most emphatically refers to the long period of Roman (now East Roman) domination over the Jews - the longest in the history of a people who has weathered many a despotic rule, and one that consequently left an indelible imprint on this people's mode of life'9 - and warns his Karaite compatriots: supremacy over Israel and of 480 years since the rise of Islam; cf., e. g., the quotation in note 19, below. Pinsker (ibid., 78 ff.) as well as M. Stein- schneider (Catal. Leiden, 6 ff.) and A. Harkavy (Studien und Mittheilungen, VIII, 136, n. 7) were mistaken in attributing the commentary to the Palestinian Yeshu'ah b. Yehudah; the work is definitely a Byzantine compilation. See on it Poznanski, The Karaite Literary Opponents of Saadiah Gaon, 65 f., No. 28. Cf., however, S. Assaf-L. Meyer, Sefer hay-Yishshub, II, 127a (No. 4) and 83b (No. 50), where Assaf concurs with Pinsker's view. A. Geiger was the first to recognize the Byzantine provenance of the Commentary and identified its author with Jacob b. Reuben; cf. Osar Nekmad (ed. I. Blumenfeld), IV (1863), 25 f., note.

Now, the Scriptures say too, "And also in the iniquities of their fathers" (ibid.)- i. e. the religion of the Traditionalists (= Rabbanites), who fix intercalation and the leap-year cycle [by calculation] and say, 'This is a tradition we received from our fathers.'... And by stating, "With them shall they pine away" (ibid.), the Scriptures refer to the ones (that is, the Karaites) who are now with them, i. e. with those who maintain they received traditions from their fathers, and now they are with them in these [practices]; they will pine away in the protracted exile.20 And yet, despite the fiery outcries of alarmed conservatives, intelligent adjustments had to be made. Naturally, the decisive modifications in ideological outlook and in the sect's own ap- praisal of its historic position in a changing world were still to come after the death of Tobias ben Moses and his colleagues, when, to the surprise and ultimate detriment of Byzantium, powerful external forces staged what Western Christianity termed "the Crusades," and the Karaite world was thrown off its balance with the destruction of the sectarian center in Jeru- salem in 1099. Even greater reforms will eventually force their way to the surface in the fifteenth century. But the trend as such, an original contribution of the Byzantine branch of the sect to the evolution of Karaism, was foreshadowed already in the first cautious steps of the eleventh-century leaders. It is in this context that I view the introduction by Tobias ben Moses of the originally geonic term ha'atakah (meaning "transmission of tra- dition") into the body of legal principles of Karaism.21 Even the 20 Li.kul, 75: oni-i (-n~I :read) -InK O'Kmipn Dm [,D'',lIN yrn 0mly] lpo' D'-Im,~ i nlrlyp InDMI 03D l D'p-, 1'' I-Di 1np'7 lDz DK m'w Dn 'D O'QlY 01 M 0-P'9: 1nD1' onK m -NZ . . n. . i n i1 n1i p nr -lnD'l -nrnrl n-iy lvy, n' pn i n tmrn =nl nlilan -in D- ODn D.ny DOn nyl D'fnl:KD Om lp -?m onK - 'V imyD lp!3)'. 21 The fact, that Tobias was the first among Karaite scholars to use the term, was already noted by Poznanski, "Anan et Ses Ecrits," REJ, XLIV (1902), 182, n. 3; Poznanski however did not go into the historical implications 9</page><page sequence="10">10 ANKORI [10] more familiar term .abbalah (meaning "receipt of tradition" - thus, in a sense, an inverted counterpart of ha'atakah) crept into Byzantine-Karaite texts of the period. It never gained popular- ity though, probably because it was too reminiscent of the nickname ba'ale hak-kabbalah (i. e. the Traditionalists), pinned on the Rabbanites by generations of Karaite polemicists.22 For, whatever their nature and degree, the changes and adjust- ments called for justification under the law. It is, in fact, this quest for legal recognition of realities of life that indirectly affords us an insight into the workings of the process of acclimatization assumed above, compensating in a way for the scantiness of information about the actual character and scope of the changes involved. Elsewhere I have elaborated to a great length on the consecutive stages in the evolution of Karaite legal principles leading up to Tobias ben Moses.23 Suffice it to note here, that ha'atakah, deliberately pronounced synonymous with both the terms denoting in the Karaite legal jargon "consensus of opinion" ('edah or kibbus) and the terms denoting "tradition" (sebel ha- of the matter. For the sake of completeness it may be noted here, that we find the term ha'atahah in the Karaite Book of Precepts, composed by the Palestinian Levi b. Yefeth as early as 1006-7. Cf. the excerpts in Pinsker's Liutue, App. X, 89, as well as in note 65a, below. It stands to reason, however, that the Hebrew text in question, similar to the Hebrew versions of all other Karaite works composed in Palestine in that period, was a product of the translation-activity undertaken in the second half of the eleventh century by the Byzantine School under the guidance, and with personal participation, of Tobias b. Moses. Thus, Tobias might have very likely inspired the translator to employ the term that he himself introduced into the Karaite legal vocabulary.- For the geonic provenance of the term see R. Elbanan's query, addressed to Hai Gaon back in 993 (A. Harkavy, Studien und Mittheilungen, IV, 24, Resp. 47; cf. the editor's notes ibid., 351 and 394), and Hai's Responsum 119 in Temlm De'im (forming part of Tummath Yesharim, Venice 1622), 22d. On Abraham ibn Ezra's use of the term see my Hebrew "Elijah Bashyachi etc.," Tarbiz, XXV (1955-6), Supplement 1. 22 Poznanski (loc. cit.) may be right in that the first Karaite scholar to use kabbalah in the sense just defined was, possibly, Yehudah Hadassi, the twelfth-century encyclopedist in Constantinople; cf. the quotation in note 24, below. There is, of course, no way of checking, in the present state of Karaite research, whether or not any of the sources that Hadassi had before his eyes, and which got lost since, did contain the term in question. 23 Cf.

"the burden of heritage," and kabbalah),24 was a double-edge sword designed to cut any knot in the legalistic confusion that the Karaite community was bound to encounter in a new environment. Substituting for sebel, or often appearing alongside of it, ha'ata.ah intended to legalize, qua tradition, observances that were originally called forth by the consensus of dissident communities in the fringe-regions of the Jewish Diaspora and grew to be regarded now as an integral component of Karaite lore.25 Denoting 'edah, on the other hand, it kept the door open for new adjustments in a different environment, by preserving the basic maxim of conforming to consensus - this time, however, meaning the consensus of the normative Rabbanite majority, given the obvious qualification that it does not offend the Karaite conscience or creed.26 An unqualified acceptance of the ha'atakah-principle was surely out of question, for it would inevitably leave the Karaites' opposition to talmudic tradition an empty shell and expose the sect to justifiable accusation of having betrayed its own principle of biblicism and merely substituted at will one (i. e. its own) tradition for another (i. e. that of the Rabbanites), or, more often than 24Cf.

That was, in fact, a favorite line of attack on Karaism, launched by spokesmen of the normative majority.27 A respectable solution in the guise of a pious qualification, albeit a legal fiction only or a merely technical face-saving device, had to be found to circumvent the difficulty. This qualification, again a contribution of Byzantine-Karaite leadership to Karaite jurisprudence, made the admissibility of ha'atakah under the law dependent on two conditions: a) the unanimous adherence thereto of all Israel, and not of the majority (i. e. the Rabbanites) only;28 b) a positive support in its favor from the Revealed Word.29 Now, while the first condition was being disposed of by the very force of life, as result of the in- evitable process of adjustment indicated above, the second, if taken at face value, surely threatened to undo all that the intro- duction of ha'atakah as a principle of law was called upon to perform in the first place. It is in confrontation with this formal demand of a scriptural backing for a tradition or custom as conditio sine qua non for the validity of the latter, that I read the crucial dictum, repeatedly invoked by later Byzantine-Karaite authorities and invariably attributed by them to Tobias ben Moses.

Now, the sage our master Tobias said of those who maintain that some traditions are in vogue which do not have support in the Written Law, that it is rather their mind which falls short of discovering a foundation [for these traditions] in the law of the Torah.30 Thus, a reassuring hand of an understanding leader has soothed the qualms of those pious adherents of the sect who must have in vain been ransacking the older Karaite literature, a product of a different (Islamic) environment, in quest for a justification of "some traditions that are in vogue which do not have support in the Written Law" and which were plainly absorbed (from the Rabbanites) or developed (by the Karaites themselves) on Byzantine soil. Deliberately couched in terms lending them- selves to somewhat ambiguous interpretation, Tobias's message to his community conveyed, in effect, the following: Never mind the scriptural basis for the present modifications; it will take care of itself. Go ahead adapting yourself to the new conditions of life, for the scriptural support for it is there, albeit our limited intelligence finds it hard to discern it.3' 30 Addereth, Section Kiddush ha-Ijodesh, Ch.

See also note 31a, below. 3I The very likely deliberate ambiguity of Tobias's doctrine is well reflected in the opposing interpretations thereof by the two most popular Byzantine- Karaite legislators, referred to in the preceding note. Thus Aaron b. Elijah utilized it in an effort to prove that ha'atakah, if standing alone, cannot qualify as an adequate source of Karaite legislation, and continued to insist on active biblical support thereto as condition of its legal validity.

On the other hand, Bashyachi, though repeatedly referring to the same statement by Tobias and half-heartedly reiterating the cliche-demand for a biblical backing of ha'atatah (see the quotations in notes 28 and 30), does not shrink from proclaiming, precisely on the basis of Tobias's doctrine, the full equality under the law of the three sources of Karaite legislation: the Divine Writ, the hettesh and the ha'atakah.

It is obvious that we deal here not with mere personal opinions of the two scholars but with generations-old trends of legal thought, reflecting opposing approaches to the crucial problem of social and legislative adjustment to changed conditions. The fact that both sides invoked Tobias entitles us to believe that these ferments date back to the eleventh-century dilemma, which the young Karaite community in Byzantium was confronted with, and to the initial efforts of Tobias b. Moses to answer the sect's immediate needs with what he considered to be of the least detriment to the basic Karaite values. 3Ia Cf. Mordecai b.

Not-too-scholarly pietists of the Rabbinical variety possibly preferred to play it safe and acknowledge particular expressions of godliness notwithstanding their Karaite origin. At the same time they avoided or, at least, hesitated in regard to specific practices, frowned at by the Karaites although fully sanctioned by Rabbanite leadership and talmudic tradition. We shall not be wrong in assuming too, that especially those godly practices which were imported from Jerusalem by Byzantine- Karaite students, who joined the Abel-.Siyyon Order when on a study-trip to the spiritual capital of Karaism, enjoyed con- siderable vogue in the Rabbanite ranks. chastisement, since it actually carries legal enactments in order to remedy the situation.

And thus - - a group from amid the Rabbanites, who used to exert themselves very ardently in justifying these (Rabbinic) Aggadoth and to proclaim very strongly their Rabbanism, seceded from the Rabbanite Synagogue, abandoned their religion and became Karaites - indeed, they left behind the creed of the Rabbanites and do not any more defend this heritage, but [on the contrary] they get ever stronger in the religion of the Karaites, [so much so that now] they reversed [their role] and are repudiating their Aggadoth and digging out the secrets of the Talmud and the abom- inable things written therein which are unknown to the simple folk.38 Even so, there still is no indication as to the number of these converts to Karaism and whether they in any way outnumbered 36 There is of course no way of statistical evaluation of the success or failure of Karaite propaganda.

Whatever the results, the text at hand permits us an interesting glimpse into the workings of Karaite propaganda in Byzantium. Although, true, the anthropomorphic Aggadoth of the Talmud and the Midrashim were long a favorite target of Karaite sneers and refutations,39 the tactic of Byzantine Karaites to harp primarily on the subject of Aggadoth, so much so that they claim converts to Karaism precisely as result of ultimate per- suasion on this point, does not seem accidental. Having realized the homiletical trend of the local Rabbanite literature, the Karaite leaders must have concentrated their attacks on the homilies in vogue among their Byzantine-Rabbanite neighbors, and, if we are to believe them, made some real headway in this direction. Similarly, the Rabbanite answer to Karaite attacks on the Aggadoth seems to have been conditioned both by the special place these homilies occupied in the spiritual make-up of Byzan- tine Rabbanism and by the Karaite assault against them. The polemics between the Rabbanites and the Karaites of Byzantium on this particular question are very likely echoed in a passage by Tobias ben Eliezer (the Rabbanite leader, not to be confused with the Karaite Tobias ben Moses!), whom we shall be copiously quoting all along in this study. The line of defence, pursued by Tobias ben Eliezer, actually borrows the Karaite method (itself indebted to the Talmud) of allegorizing the anthropomor- phic portraits of the Deity in the Five Books of Moses and in the Prophetic Writings. At the same time, by emphasizing the role of tradition not only in regard to content but also as a way of perpetuating forms and figures of speech, it accepts the midrashic presentations as no more objectionable than several expressions in the Bible itself against which no Karaite would dare raise his voice.40 39 Cf.

At any rate, Karaism undoubtedly became, with the flow of years, a factor to be reckoned with in Byzantine Jewry; indeed, toward the end of the eleventh century, the Rabbanite leader Tobias ben Eliezer could not any longer ignore the influence of his sectarian neighbors.4' Much like his contemporary, the alarmed Karaite conservative quoted earlier in this study, also Tobias ben Eliezer, the Rabbanite, uses his commentary (Lekac Tob) on the Pentateuch and the Five Scrolls to warn his flock against the tendency to overlook the differences between the two factions in Jewry and strikes hard at the major points of Karaite-Rabbanite divergency. Still, following the geonic policy, Tobias does not specifically name a single Karaite scholar nor does he clearly quote by title a single Karaite composition in the numerous references to Karaite views which he could not help introducing into his works.

A great deal of, but by no means all, the pertinent anti-Karaite material from the Pentateuch- part of the Commentary has been assembled by Buber, loc. cit., Introd., 34 f. (17b-18a). In the succeeding notes reference will be made to Buber's afore- mentioned edition of Genesis-Exodus; A. M.

It goes without saying that a critical evaluation of Tobias's statements or the tracing of his sources are entirely beyond the scope of the present study. 19</page><page sequence="20">20 ANKORI [20] directly addresses his opponents as "Karaites",42 and only once he unwittingly admits of being familiar with a Karaite com- mentator.43 Otherwise, he philosophically sneers at "the fools" or at "those who are in error", or, even more frequently, simply fights opinions or ideas without introducing a tangible opponent and without giving as much as a hint to personal contacts that he must have had with Karaites on a local level. Indeed, the earlier nineteenth-century scholars, who mistakenly placed Tobias ben Eliezer in Germany, where Karaism was physically unknown, had no difficulty in explaining away his anti-sectarian allusions as mere theoretical considerations, originating in fami- liarity with the writings of, say, Sa'adyah Gaon, or in possible encounter with living Karaites on a visit to Palestine.44 And yet, though using well-known cliches of Rabbanite- Karaite discussion, Tobias ben Eliezer's Lekah Tob is more important for the tracing of social relations between the two factions of Jewry in Byzantium than a scholastically more original or profound treatise could ever be, for, being what it is - a midrash - it is, more than any other genre of Rabbinical writing, indicative of ideas and arguments that were fed into the rank and file of Byzantine Jewry by popular preachers on Sabbaths and festivals. True, the commentary was composed in the time of the First Crusade4s and, to a great extent, it stimulated replies and refutations of twelth-century Karaite polemicists to whom, for chronological reasons, we shall not refer here.46 But, blending 42 LekaF Tob, Deuteronomy, 70 (35b): . . . imiDv D'Kipni ly nml ^l n; ibid., 77 (39a) - see quotation in the next note. 43 Loc. cit.: ins =ilt ti yri-r' ... nOW 1',p iv -ilnm.

Thus it belongs to our eleventh-century story of Karaite- Rabbanite relations in the Byzantine Empire. Significantly, Tobias ben Eliezer is concerned very little with the numerous instances of academic dissent voiced by the Karaites on many a point in the exposition of the Scriptures. Instead, he scores especially the cases of socially manifest diver- gences of practice. These can only very briefly be summarized here:47 a) the absence of Sabbath-candles from Karaite homes. Here matters of practicality and mode of life were stressed not less than differences in juridical interpretation. Counteracting Kara- ite propaganda which used to point to the scholarly differences within the Rabbanite camp as proof of the unreliableness of talmudic tradition, Tobias ben Eliezer, much like the later Abraham ibn Dafid in Spain, hails the unanimity of all Rabbinic sages in regard to the principle of lighting candles on the eve of the Sabbath and shelves the differences as pertaining only to details of observance;48 hak-Kofer (commenced in 1148). See on it Poznanski, Kar. Lit. Opponents of Saadiah, 71; Buber, loc cit., Introd., 47 (24a), No. 6; and, most recently, my own "Elijah Bashyachi etc.," Tarbiz, XXV (1955-6). 47 Tobias's anti-Karaite arguments are fully quoted and discussed in Chapter III of my dissertation. 48 Lekah Tob, Genesis, 17 (9a); Exodus, 106 (53b), 211 (106a).

Eliezer (or his sources) on Ibn Datid's polemic against the Karaites. The similarity, though, in the phraseology employed by the two anti-Karaite writers on either end of the Mediterranean does not seem to be accidental. Cf.

The fact that Tobias considered it necessary to dwell to a very great length on the interpretation of nnnn nrin and did not feel that the traditional argumentation, quoted by him, amply disposes of the sectarian polemics in the matter, serves as indirect testimony to the Karaite stress in Byzantium on this particular divergence between their own practice and that of their Rabbanite neighbors.50 It is also likely that the Karaites pointed to the procedure among their Greek-Orthodox compatriots of having the Pentecost fall on the seventh Sunday after Easter, for Tobias ben Eliezer deems it necessary to repu- diate this kind of proof;5s I, 47: oDwn ,=n i'r i,man i 'nT , '3 nr'vln y-'n^ imnn=n n=pn '-m -t -n3T Ht1paN .vnliln: NN ;mIYD ni p'yM "t"n lpnm RN1 ...

The consciousness, in both factions of Jewry, of the similarity between Christianity and Karaism on the matter of celebrating Pentecost on a Sunday is attested as late as the sixteenth century in Turkey (earlier Byzantium). Cf., e. g., Kaleb Afendopolo (as reported, from his 'Asarah Ma'amaroth, in Dod Mordecai, 2a), and Joseph Beghi (as quoted, from his Iggereth Kiryah Ne'emanah, in Mann, Texts and Studies, II, 306 f.) - both Karaites, who cite a passage to this effect from Livyath Hen of the thirteenth-century Rabbanite Levi b.

In the same category be- longs the controversy in regard to the consumption of the fat- tail.53 I did not find, however, in Tobias's work any allusion to similarity in interpretation of the biblical verse in question was stressed Ioarw ll]K D1' Olv y ann [ 6nn n :i. e.] ay3p Qoy [DorrK inn '1 '=] 1IDm1 D'wpm aD'p11 n 1'un 1 D1 oouD nri nan nnmon in,n), it seems that the mutual interest of Jews (esp. Karaites) and Christians in the field of calendation went far beyond the limits of neighborly curiosity. In fact, Hadassi actually attests to the Karaites' inquiry into the Christian dating of festivals as a possible indicator for the sectarian calendar, failing clear-cut instructions from Palestine; see below, note 87. And, vice versa, recall the story by Matthew of Edessa, concerning Moses of Cyprus who was summoned by the Emperor as consultant in the intra-Christian controversy over the date of Easter in 1007; cf. Starr, op. cit., 185, No. 127 (cp. 61). While this Jewish expert in calendation was undoubtedly a Rabbanite, it is of interest to note here that the Byzantine formula of abjuration for Hebrews entering Christian faith, dated 1027, which lists in the course of a series of anathemas as well as in a separate appendix the different Jewish holidays, betrays a conspicuous, though inconsistent, slant toward Karaite terminology. Cf. V. N. Beneshevich, "On the History of the Jews in Byzantium, VI-X Cent." (Russian), Evreiskaia Mysl (1926), 197 ff., 305 ff.; cp.

(onmD' ;mltrn), or as proof that the truth is "not the way those who wandered astray say..." (D,yinn nDimW 1Di z i) - is, of course, an indirect recognition of the growth of Karaite influence and of the popularity of Karaite practices in Byzantium toward the end of the eleventh century, corresponding, in a reverse sense, to the indirect indication of Rabbanite influence on the Karaite mode of life that followed from the above-quoted fulminations of the Karaite Anonymus. In fact, as already mentioned, Tobias ben Eliezer, admits of being familiar even with Karaite commentaries;56 since he prob- and Studies, II, 62 ff., where also Mann's earlier research in the matter is listed. The importance attached to these details was such as to warrant a specific stipulation in marriage-contracts between Rabbanite and Karaite to the effect that the dietary scruples of either party will duly be respected. Cf. our quotations below, note 60. 54 See on it most recently S. D. Goitein, "A Caliph's Decree in Favour of the Rabbanite Jews in Palestine," JJS, V (1954), 118 ff., and the literature listed there. It is difficult to decide, whether or not the fact, that Tobias limited himself to mere repetition of the talmudic discussion of the pertinent verse, without so much as hinting to Karaite practice, has any significance. - On the Byzantine aspect of the well-known Karaite injunction against partaking of meat altogether, as part of the doctrine of exilic mourning (Abeluth), cf.

Moreover, the preponderance of cases in which his strictures against unorthodox practices and views is anony- mous, without officially blaming the latter on the sectaries alone, may be indicative of the fact that Tobias ben Eliezer, while denouncing the Karaites, addressed himself actually to some of his own co-religionists, who showed visible symptoms of having been affected by the influence of their Karaite neighbors.58 5. Obviously, the area most exposed to friction in the field of Rabbanite-Karaite relations was that of the not infrequent discrepancies between the pre-calculated Rabbinical calendar and that resulting from the Karaite insistence on actual wit- nessing of the New Moon for determining Rosh-.Hodesh and on 57 To be sure, Tobias does use Arabic in one connection. Cf. Leka!i Tob, Exodus, 188 f. (94b-95a), where Arabic terms for the twelve precious stones are introduced. Nevertheless, rather than suppose an actual knowledge of Arabic on the part of Tobias, it seems more plausible to assume that we have here technical terms, used, at the time under discussion, by dealers and customers all over the East-Mediterranean. Were it not so, there would hardly be a point in deviating from the usual procedure of introducing Greek equivalents for difficult Hebrew words (see on it Buber, loc. cit., Introd., 35 f. [18a-b], No. 16, and J. Perles, "Jiidish-Byzantinische Beziehungen," Byz. Ztschr., II [1893], 574 f.), and offering, without much ado, Arabic terminology instead. The latter must have obviously been professionally known to Jewish merchants in Byzantium. Incidentally, we are in possession of a special treatise on precious stones, possibly written by a Byzantine Karaite some time in the late eleventh or early twelfth century. Cf. M. Steinschneider, Catalogue Leiden, 106 f. and 391 f. (App. VI). 58 Scolding those Rabbanites who, preferring to play it safe, pursued both the Rabbanite and Karaite method (e. g., in calendation -see below, note 99, for an actual occurrence of this sort), Tobias b.

Hananyah, whom the heads of the Academies appointed to the office of exilarch as a substitute for 'Anan) employs [a calendar based upon] calculation [of the time of the New Moon] and intercalation [of leap-years] by cycles, whereas mine follows the actual observation of the [New] Moon and [intercalation that is regulated by the ripening of] Abib.63 Since the two factors determining the Karaite calendar are usually lumped together in the early texts (and, being equal in point of importance, quite justifiably so), little attention had been paid to the fact that their history is not at all identical. While it is beyond the scope of the present study to attempt an account of how these two calendar-determinants fared in the course of ages, some of the phases of their history are closely interwoven with the life-story of Karaism in Byzantium and directly belong into our chronological framework. The Karaite Abzb-system, with which we shall be concerned first in the succeeding pages, made the constant flow of commu- nication between Palestine and the Diaspora not only a matter of practical necessity but, indeed, a quasi-religious imperative. In a sense, the Palestino-centric orientation of the Karaites in their system of calendation,64 so emphatically endorsed by the scholars and Abele-.Siyyon of Jerusalem from the end of the ninth century on, was, historically speaking, a sui generis nemesis of Palestine in return for lost hegemony that was wrested from her by the hand of Babylonian Rabbanism. (We recall, of course, the fact that the last outward expression of this struggle within Rabbanism in the geonic age was indeed the calendar-controv- ersy involving Ben-Meir and Sa'adyah Gaon).

Rather, it may have been the local Karaites' expression of the same sectional ambitions and interests that were at work among their Rabbanite counter- parts. Unlike the Babylonian Karaites, the sectarians of Byzantium did not only keep in close touch with Palestine on the pertinent issues of calendation, but frankly identified themselves with the nationalistic and scholarly circles of Abele-.Siyyon. Their leaders, educated in Palestine and imbued with Palestinian-Karaite ideals, endeavored to pursue the mode of life of the saintly "Mourners" even after they returned to their native land. It therefore will not appear surprising that precisely the A bb- problem became the barometer of tension between the Karaites and their Rabbanite neighbors in the Empire, ultimately leading to grave consequences. 6. The Rabbanite attitude toward intercalation on the basis of the state of new grain in Palestine depended of course on the locality.

Here, sporadic difficulties in communication with Palestine, even before the Crusades, often caused delays and doubts among the Karaites themselves, making the task of Rabbanite polemicists ever easier. With all the goodwill and determination of the local Karaite leadership to follow the lead of Palestine in matters of calendar, something had to be done about it, and fast. In fact, we possess a reference to an official query by Tobias ben Moses, the leader of the Karaites in Constantinople, and his colleagues, addressed to the Karaite authorities in the Holy City, asking them how to act in case of doubt.69 The sending of the query might have been prompted by the especially complicated situation in the early seventies of the eleventh century, when the Seljiuk conquests in the East (Manzikert and Jerusalem 1071!) harassed the regular communications between Palestine and the Empire. The reply of the Jerusalem sages advised to follow in the meantime the Rabbanite way of calendation, pending a report from Palestine, and then celebrate also the date suggested by the Karaites (to the extent of its practicability, 67 Levi's words are usually quoted in paraphrase, as reported by Aaron b.

What it actually amounted to was the confirmation of the pathof inevitable adjustment, followed anyway by the local leadership of the Byzantine-Karaite community.7I However, in the event of timely arrival of letters from Jerusalem with the necessary information on the state of Abib, the matter would be entirely different: Byzantine-Karaite leadership would 70 Ibid.: nl rym ni pDorn i :DD 2 mn 1, 13t :ni11D Omn' n3lnn ntm31 :'.rhnr ro3 HTDZ^I n3na iTi vimn,' D3o( nlsn ^331 3'3K I im,.

Starr's interpretation of the text to the effect that "the responsum advised in a conciliatory tone that in the event of doubt arising, they (i. e. the Karaites) were to follow the Rabbanite practice" (Jews in the Byz. Empire, 243), is inaccurate. The responsum suggests rather stringency by way of celebrating both dates (i. e. that of the Rabbanites, arrived at by calculation, and that of the Karaites), in order to avoid the slightest chance of desecrating a holiday - which, incidentally, is in full accord with the general slant toward stringency that characterizes Karaite legislation (note: 3':3ml ni'nn nlrnyi n poDin .n i 5 a n L a im ; or: 'l n ni s : 3 ,\ 1--n lnt). 71 Pinsker (Liuutue .admoniyoth, App. XI, 93 ff.) connected the above exchange of letters between the Constantinople community, led by Tob;as b. Moses, and the Jerusalem Karaite sages, with the name of Yeshu'ah b. Yehudah, the last great representative of sectarian learning in the Holy City. This may very well have been the case, although Yeshu'ah's name is not mentioned in our text explicitly. All other conclusions, however, drawn by Pinsker in the same connection - namely, that Yeshu'ah was Tobias's teacher during the latter's sojourn in Jerusalem, and that he answered the query of his pupil in the form of a book entitled Osar Ne.mad -have been proven untenable. See on it in full my "The Correspondence of Tobias b. Moses the Karaite of Constantinople," Salo Baron Jubilee Volume, as well as the first chapter of my Hebrew essay in Tarbiz, XXV (1955-6). - On the same occasion Pinsker informs us, in behalf of Abraham Firkowicz, that among the Karaite mss. which perished in the Gozlow library in the course of war was a commentary on the Pentateuch by Tobias b. Moses, and, appended thereto, "a priceless epistle, it being a reply to him (i. e. to Tobias) from Jerusalem, no doubt from his master R. Yeshu'ah." Whether the testimony about the alleged one-time existence of such a letter in Gozlow is to be accepted at its face-value depends of course entirely on the extent of credence one is ready to lend to Firkowicz's word. Cf. P. F. Frankl, "Karaische Studien," MGWJ, XXV (1876), 56 ff., for another letter produced by Firkowicz, concerning our Tobias (in Bene Reshef, 15 ff.). That letter, however, was pronounced spurious by Frankl and by later authorities.</page><page sequence="33">[33] KARAITE-RABBANITE RELATIONS IN BYZANTIUM then unequivocally follow the instructions supplied by its Palestinian mentors. Thus, in a situation when, say, the new grain in Palestine was reported not to have been showing yet signs of ripeness in the month succeeding Addr, a proclamation of a leap-year would follow, which meant postponement of Passover to a date by a whole month later than the one marked on the Rabbanite calendar; the Karaites would then have the month of Nisan paralleling the Rabbanite month of Iyyar. It is not difficult to guess that the Rabbanites, sharing with the sectaries the same neighborhood in the Byzantine capital and elsewhere in the Empire, would not conceal their annoyance with Karaite defiance of their holiday (involving the open use of hames, etc.). A contest of strength would be inevitable. Surely, not all the instances of friction were recorded in the first place, and, then, not all the documents that may have contained references to such facts had hitherto been recovered or edited. Significantly perhaps, none of the Karaite texts, published until now, lists any specific case to this effect, although we do have occasional mentions of feuds stemming from calendar- discrepancies. The latter, however, as we shall see presently, were caused not by A bb-reports but by Karaite insistence on lunar observation in determining Rosh-.Fodesh. Nevertheless, one grave incident connected with the Abib-problem is related in a private letter of a Byzantine Rabbanite to his learned brother in Fustat.72 Moreover, the wording of the letter clearly indicates that the incident to be described was not the first "affair of the non-conformist Karaites, may they be accursed !"73 72 Mann, Texts and Studies, I, 48 ff. A short excerpt of the letter was reproduced in Assaf-Meyer, Sefer hay-Yishshiib, II, 107b, No. 22.

While Mann's 33</page><page sequence="34">34 ANKORI [34] The exact location of the writer is unknown. While Thessa- lonica was suggested by Mann, because of a reference in the letter to the presence of Jews from Russia74 (Russian merchants were wont to participate in the Thessalonican fair of St. De- metrios), Starr's suggestion of Constantinople commends itself more,75 for it stands to reason that only a large and well-organized community, such as that of the Karaites in the capital, could risk a showdown involving governmental intervention. As you know, my dear brother - writes the Rabbanite correspondent - the Karaites assaulted us again last year and desecrated the festivals of the Lord, and celebrated the New Year in the eighth month, for they had received letters from Palestine to the effect that the ripening of A bb was not sighted in NZsan; consequently, the Passover had been celebrated in Iyydr. And in that time they thus committed evil things and God brought upon them confusion. Now a violent enmity developed between us and great quarrels took place - 76 "Rejoinder," ibid., 305 f., amply disposes of Krauss's criticism, it may be not superfluous to add that the use of u'w,inn as "dissenters from the path of orthodoxy" was not confined to one party alone. It was a household word among polemicists on both sides of the fence, and, moreover, not necessarily derogatory. Cf. the account by the Karaite (!) Tobias b. Moses, quoted above, note 38: pl'np 1'irl Don in'm l'n 1, ' 9 n n '3.

No comparable text of such a communication - which when directed to the Byzantine-Karaite community was most probably phrased in Hebrew - has so far been found and published.</page><page sequence="35">[35] KARAITE-RABBANITE RELATIONS IN BYZANTIUM The letter goes on to report that the Karaites have filed charges with the government which resulted in the imposition of a heavy fine (amounting to close to a thousand dinars) on the Rabbanite faction. 77 Apart from the intrinsic interest that the above story of the calendar-feud evokes as an example of Karaite-Rabbanite rela- tions at their worst, there is an additional implication therein that was hitherto overlooked. For, significantly, the writer of the epistle has no comment on the nature of the charge, and though he uses the term hilshinu, meaning "delation", he does not imply that the accusations were of a slanderous character. Also, when a special meeting of the congregation was subse- quently convoked for the purpose of reading some anti-Karaite messages, sent by the writer's brother from Egypt,78 only the cliche religious deviations of the Karaites were again cited, but not a word was uttered against the Karaites' costly invocation of governmental aid. Now, in view of the high amount of penalty imposed on the Rabbanites and of all the legal troubles that were inevitably connected with it, it seems unlikely that 77 Mann, op. cit., 50: [o,'-in=] i,-n l nip ,np= vly nm ,;1 0'33o nN 13ivm 'n,n's. The emendations attempted on the closing word of this phrase did not prove fully satisfactory, as Starr correctly observes in his note, op. cit., 184. Thus, Mann's suggestion, loc. cit., n. 6, 'nnis,, i. e. VrkprvupL, won the concurrence of Krauss, HUCA, X (1935), 291, since it "versetzt uns in die erste tiirkische Zeit (ur 1450), da noch die alten griechischen Miinznamen im Schwange waren." However, precisely Krauss's reasoning makes us mindful of the fact, that it was not before the end of the thirteenth century that the hyperpyron replaced the nomisma (vbPLaoAa). Cf. A. Andreades, "De la Monnaie ... dans l'Empire Byzantin," Byzantion, I (1924), 75 ff., esp. 75 and 78. On the other hand, the graphically more plausible solution offered by F. Perles in his review of Mann's book, Orientalistische Literaturzeitung, XXXVI (1933), 537 f., esp. the end-remark on 538-"statt des ratselhaften '-n:, ni",in zu lesen ist ,n9n, d.i. b7rapTyvp(os), 'silberhaltig' " - is incompatible with the general connotation of dinarim as gold coins. (The hyperpyri, incidentally, were, much like their forerunners, the nomismata, a gold currency. Cf. Andreades, loc. cit.). 78 Mann, loc. cit.: iinzm ... l'nin-R' lyyn m 'n , nrnm mpnn n 3niK jinml nlrnn icip ninzn non -nN t"Ro ' npn) i: 'yllnr rn-'P ivy nimiD w rta ylnD h 131ii ayn i: 1y n nnllo i: nK (Otipn==) siwnn 1t n irb-vi n-in nK oyn ylD31l }m Dyn ; i3y n' Dota nli. 35</page><page sequence="36">ANKORI the writer would not have seized the opportunity to expatiate in a private(!) letter on the evil doings of these "accursed Kara- ites" had there been any slander involved in the charges that the latter have brought against the other branch of Jewry before the civil authorities. It is apparent then, that the Rabbanites themselves felt all along that their sectarian neighbors were within their legal rights in complaining to the government, although of course they were not going to let the matter rest at that so far as their religious conscience was concerned. Thus, the above occurrence, unfortunately so meager in details, entitles us to infer a status of autonomy, officially recognized by the government and vested in the Byzantine-Karaite leader- ship of the Empire. It granted the Karaites the rights and privileges of a self-containing religious unit that has full juris- diction over its own mode of life and ritual observances without fear of being exposed, against its wish, to possible interference on the part of the normative Jewish majority. Incidentally, the "partition" (mehissah), that Benjamin of Tudela saw in the twelfth century in the Jewish quarter of Constantinople, dividing between the dwellings of the five hundred Karaites, who lived "on one side", and the community of the Rabbanites there (four or five times that number),79 may well have been not a mere figure of speech but an actual wall or fence, possibly erected on advice (or instructions) of the civil authorities in order to ease the tension between the two parties, especially on festivals falling on different dates.80 Chances are that an echo of these events reaches us through a remark of the above-quoted Rabbanite homilist Tobias ben Eliezer. Commenting on the Canticles, Tobias states the fol- lowing: "My mother's children were angry with me" (Cant. 1:6) - these are the sinners in Israel who bring evil upon Israel 79 Itinerary, ed.

Apart from evident orthographical errors in the text quoted last, there is a basic difference between the two versions. While, in the first, mnnuith means intra-Jewish heresy, in the other it denotes outright apostasy. Following this distinction, the first text implies that so long as the Jews keep their unity and refrain from sectarian dissensions, the Gentile governments will not take away their money (in fines etc.). Mnfuth may also denote here Gentile courts to which the "sinners in Israel" have brought their suit against the Jewish community. The other version, however, intends to convey that so long as the Jews refrain from apostasy (to Christianity) the Gentile nations will continue to take away their money (probably meaning the poll-tax and other special taxes). In the second case then, the author deals with the position of the Jews in general in a Gentile world, and has no specific incident in mind. If so, it is difficult to see in what way precisely have the "sinners in Israel" ( yvn , y~wn), aga;nst whom, after all, the verse is invoked, been responsible for this general status of Jewry. - It is of course an almost impossible task to prove the originality of a passage in such a compilatory work as Lebatz Tob. I am satisfied, however, that the comment in question appears in none of the Midrashim on the Canticles that served as Tobias's standard sources. In fact, Jellinek points out in his introduction, loc. cit., xi, that he has chosen out of the whole text only "die einfachsten, von dem Anstrich der Hagada freien, Erlauterungen"; hence he too, when including our text in his edition of excerpts, must have been convinced of the originality of Tobias's interpretation. And so, even allowing for certain elements of earlier homilies, the special twist in the passage belongs to the pen of Tobias b. Eliezer. By deviating from the elaborate and generally reiterated pattern of homily for the verse in question, the author obviously intended to convey an allusion to contemporary events that stood out vividly in the minds of his listening and reading audience. 37</page><page sequence="38">38 ANKORI [38] same verse against the "Shepherds of the Exile", i. e. the leaders of the normative majority.82 (To be continued) 82 Cf. the Byzantine-Karaite compilation of that time, Sefer ha-'Osher, by Jacob b.

Thus, Jellinek, loc. cit., 67, paid special attention to an interpretation, reported by Tobias in the name of his father: 1MD3 &amp;VW, ' 1 ,1KDti 310D 1nl-I 1pV 1p tkn "'D "rt 'ID K2M ,V1DW p-Fln 1lr 1DVn D1 il;1 p n IDK ' 1 D1 13p ,-It 11iP 0oVn 021 -lt 11' 1PDZ; ,1' ]D8' Jellinek remarks (loc. cit., Introd., xii), that he found the same comment in a Karaite composition.

It is impossible, in the present state of Karaite research, to decide who of the two exegetes was on the borrowing end. Since Tobias attributes the comment to his father, it was known, so we may assume, in Byzantium some time about the seventies of the eleventh century, when, incidentally, also the Karaite translation and compilation activity was in full swing. On the other hand, though the chronology of the Byzantine Karaite Jacob b. Reuben is still open to question, the latter, whether living in the late eleventh or some time in the twelfth century, was at any rate more than likely to have drawn his material from Karaite masters preceding even Tobias's father, the way he did all along in Sefer ha-'Osher. Whatever the solution of the detail at hand, a careful comparative study of LekaF Tob and of the contemporary Byzantine-Karaite compilations by an expert in the field of biblical exegesis, might yield some interesting insights and would considerably enhance the task of the student of Byzantine-Karaite history in the reconstruction of the Rabbanite-Karaite interrelations in the Empire during and after the eleventh century.</page></plain_text>
