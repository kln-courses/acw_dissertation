Barbara Heldt belongs to the liberal humanist branch or to what, following Elaine Showalter, she calls the American version of feminism, which emphasizes not repression (the French) or oppression (the English Marxist) but expression. Professor Heldt's freedom from radical feminist dogma and politically-motivated theory will appeal to some and not to others. For some it will seem to be her Achilles heel; for others it will be one of her main charms. Undoubtedly it will ensure her a wider and more enduring sympathy than a study of the former type might have done and by entering into open dialogue with the male-dominated critical tradition she is much more likely to influence it for the better. UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM MALCOLM V. JONES The Image of Ivan the Terrible in Russian Folklore. By MAUREEN PERRIE. (Cambridge Studies in Oral and Literate Culture) Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. I987. x + 26pp. ?27.50. Ivan the Terrible, like Peter the Great, looms large in the historical mythology of Russia: his image crops up in political and historical writing as well as in art, literature, and film. It might be thought that blame for the popular vision of Ivan as the epitome of crazed despotism should be placed upon the comparative dearth of written records and source material for Russian history before the middle of the eighteenth century, were it not that the personality and activities of the Tsar had already begun to inspire legend, story, and song during his lifetime. It is this body of material about the terrible Tsar, recorded over the last four hundred years, that forms the subject of Maureen Perrie's book. The author is well aware that to be useful as historical sources, folk tales and songs need the utmost care in handling, but as she points out, a folk image is interesting not simply for its historicity, or as a glimpse of contemporary reaction to Ivan, but also as a reflection of enduring Russian popular conceptions of the ideal ruler. Examin- ing the material for historical accuracy, she notes the migratory nature of many of the stories about Ivan, the distorted rendering of historical events and inclusion of ahistorical motifs. Though it is not often possible to establish whether a song or tale is contemporary to Ivan or not, it seems that the popular image of Ivan changed relatively little over succeeding centuries. Steering her way through conflicting Soviet interpretations representing different periods of Soviet historical thinking at least as much as scholarly interpretation of Ivan, Dr Perrie argues convincingly that Ivan's arbitrary cruelty is condoned, even lauded, on grounds of political expediency: brutality may be necessary to the strong ruler in his role of protector of the ordinary people. Parallels with the views of Ivan Peresvetov, a member of the dvorianstvo, are striking and could have been explored further. For an understanding of later Russian history and culture, the importance of this widespread acceptance and justification of cruelty in the ruler by the bulk of the population (the West- ernized elite took over from the boyars as those who objected most strongly) cannot be overestimated, and provides a counterbalance to modern views that whatever the overall estimation of Ivan's achievement, his psychopathic violence is to be utterly deplored. Dr Perrie's book on the folk songs and stories about Ivan is the first full-length study in English, though the subject has absorbed the attention of several Russian and Soviet folklorists and historians. She picks her way among the various interpre- tations of the material with the utmost skill, proffering thoroughly sensible if Reviews 542</page><page sequence="2">Reviews occasionally too tentative conclusions. If modest in scope, the book is well re- searched and extremely reliable. Scrupulous analysis of the material is comple- mented by annotated translations of variants of all the main texts. Those who might regard the subject as marginal should be assured that the specific conclusions about Ivan's enduring folk image have much more relevance than might at first appear to the understanding of modern Russian and Soviet history and culture. SCHOOL OF SLAVONIC AND EAST EUROPEAN STUDIES, FAITH WIGZELL LONDON Birds and Other Relations: Selected Poetry of Dezso' Tandori. Translated by BRUCE BERLIND. (Lockert Library of Poetry in Translation) Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. 1986 [I987]. xii + 153 pp. ?17.40 (paperbound ?6.35). The last decade or so has seen the death of many of the greatest post-war Hungarian poets, notably Laszlo Nagy, Janos Pilinszky, and Gyula Illyes. Simultaneously, there has been a sea change in Hungarian poetry: in the volatile climate of Central and Eastern Europe in the I98os the traditional role of the poet-leader-saviour is increasingly seen as both irrelevant and unperformable. It is not surprising that creative linguistic energies in Hungary are now being channelled, instead, into prose: Peter Esterhazy's phenomenal Introduction to Literature and Peter Nadas's Book of Memoirs, for example, are far more interesting and important than any post-war poetry, Pilinszky alone excepted. It is in this context that the present selection of forty-five poems from the 1970s work of Dezso Tandori should be seen. Now aged fifty, Tandori is a prodigiously fecund litterateur, whose colossal output embraces detective stories, children's books, and translations from a dozen languages, as well as novels, plays, poetry, and literary criticism; he is also a graphic artist. Much of his often technically brilliant poetry is fashionably and fascinatingly reflexive, being rooted in the minutiae of a daily life devoted exclusively to writing - and to the sparrows that find themselves in the title as well as on the dust-jacket of this beautifully-produced bilingual edition. Readers who enjoyed Bruce Berlind's excellent versions of Agnes Nemes Nagy's anthropomorphic landscapes will recognize the kind of care and attention that he has lavished on these translations, and those with clear reference points outside language (for example, the series on Impressionist paintings, and some of the bird poems) work eerily well. But many of the purely reflexive-reflective improvisations, with their delicately fractured syntax and wispy content, disintegrate under the thud of transatlantic paraphrase, and their closing doubly or trebly punning twists are usually well beyond the translator's reach (see 'It goes on', 'And there isn't', and "'Let's buy him an alarm clock"', for example). The original Hungarian on the facing page offers the toughest of tests to both translator and printer; Bruce Berlind does not always pass, though sometimes his rough-translator is clearly to blame ('szine barnabb' misread as 'szinte barnabb' (p. 74)), and it is disappointing to note almost a hundred misprints, some in the English and confusing ('its quiet planned I with telephone receivers' for 'planted' (p. 45)). None the less, there is much to enjoy in this volume, and it brings welcome light and colour to the somewhat ragged patchwork quilt of Hungarian poetry available in English.
