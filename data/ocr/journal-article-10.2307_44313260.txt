Graves It is a theological commonplace both in John Milton's day and our own to acknowledge that God is a Spirit. It is apparently self-evident that God is therefore immaterial. However, the recent intense scrutiny concerning the provenance of De Doctrina Christiana , traditionally attributed to Milton, has brought to the attention of critics a number of idiosyncratic theological ar- guments typical of Milton within the treatise. One of these is the material- ity of God. Questions concerning the treatises provenance initiated by Wil- liam B. Hunter in 1992, which have been refuted to the satisfaction of virtu- ally all other Milton scholars, have resulted in energetic discussion of the congruencies of theological material in the treatise with that of canonical Miltonie works.1 The most heretical contention that this systematic theolo- gy manifests is an unusual form of biblical hermeneutics concerning the Godhead - namely, a refutation of the Nicaean formulation of the Trinity for which, writes Milton, "the only authority I accepted was God's self-rev- elation" ( CPW 6:1 18) in the Scriptures. One crucial element of Milton's bib- lical hermeneutics in De Doctrina and manifested in Paradise Lost is his pre- sentation of the theory of accommodation, which is the theological tool used by Christian exegetes to explain the difference between the nature of God and our images or conceptions of Him. Recent studies of Milton's accommoda- tion of God by Michael Lieb and Neil D. Graves have shown that the place- ment of Milton within an orthodox Christian hermeneutic tradition, as posited by C. A. Patrides among others, is erroneous. In fact Milton displayed a far greater literal understanding of a theomorphic scriptural deity than virtually all other biblical exegetes. These concerns over the ontological composition and portrayal of God lead naturally to the question of divine materiality in Milton's philosophy and poetry. This issue has not been considered specifically and at length since John Reesing's article in 1957, 2 but critics have failed to realize that it is inte- gral to our understanding of Milton's conception of a monistic hierarchy of 497</page><page sequence="2">498 Neil D. Graves being. Recent work by Miltonists such as Stephen M. Fallon and John Rog- ers have made clear that this ontological Weltanschauung derives all being from the one substance that is matter, but the question that has been neatly sidestepped by scholars concerns what is referred to by all being. The ques- tion implicit in this statement is whether Milton's God Himself is included in the metaphysical category of "a// being," and this I will argue necessitates a réévaluation of Milton's debt to the early patristic theologians Tertullian, Irenaeus, and Origen. Most scholars have ignored this problem altogether, and even those who have been forced to confront the Deity's ontological composition in the course of their analysis of Milton's monistic metaphys- ics have refused to consider the question at any length3 or have presented the thesis only tentatively.4 The central problem is whether Milton's God should be posited beyond the apex of the author's concept of a monistic hierarchy of being composed of matter. I believe the answer lies in the consideration of three interrelated points: first, Milton's unusual understanding of the theory of accommodation in chapter 2 of De Doctrina makes it clear that he believed God to be theopathetic, and this strongly suggests that Milton may also have envisaged God as theomorphic; second, in what appears a para- dox, Milton's statement that "God [. . .] is a SPIRIT" ( CPW 6:140) actually implies that God is material; and, third, Milton argues repeatedly in De Doc- trina , as well as in Artis Logicaey that terms predicated of God in the Bible have the same physical and metaphysical meaning when used with reference to man, and this seemingly eccentric idea is explored in several key phrases in Milton's delineation of material monism in the treatise. I Historically, the idea of God's being passible was far more defensible than the concept of His possessing a material body. Milton is explicit in chapter 2 of De Doctrina that the descriptions of God as being angry or repentant, what he would describe as theopathetic references, should be accepted as faithful descriptions of the Deity and not explained away as condescending anthropopatheia. He addresses this issue head-on, arguing that "If Jehovah repented that he had created man , Gen. vi. 6, [. . .] let us believe that he did repent" ( CPW 6:134), stating clearly that "In my opinion, then, theologians do not need to employ anthropopathy, or the ascription of human feelings to God." Similarly, it seems unnecessary in many of Milton's other descrip- tions of God's demonstrating emotion (see CPW 1:274) to interpret them as subject to accommodation, and in De Doctrina Milton takes this to the most surprising lengths: "Let us believe that it is not beneath God to feel what grief he does feel, to be refreshed by what refreshes him, and to fear what he does fear" (CPW 6:140). However, the question is as to whether in the more</page><page sequence="3">The Materiality of Milton's God 499 obvious cases for an accommodatory hermeneutic - the corporeal descrip- tions and references to God - Milton similarly declined to employ a conde- scending mode of accommodation. In short, did Milton believe God to be as blatantly theomorphic as he seems to regard Him as theopathetic?5 Throughout the history of theology, anthropomorphism and anthro- popathy have been closely tied, and theologians have been aware that to en- tertain passibility seriously is to grant latitude to the idea of a corporeal God that carries far more radical and serious implications. God is Spirit, and the concept of a materially manifested God is obscenely heretical for most theo- logians. Milton's passible Deity promotes his belief in Goďs materiality, and this suggests an interesting comparison to the argument of Thomas Aquinas in De Veritate , Summa Contra Gentiles , and Summa Theologiae that God cannot be passible because a passible Deity would be necessarily corporeal and this is simply ridiculous. As is immediately evident, one of the major premises for Aquinas' argument is that, as there is no doubt that corporeal references to God in the Bible are subject to accommodatory interpretation, the same is true of the less obviously crude instances of passibility. While Aquinas does present other arguments for the impassibility of God (includ- ing its incompatibility with the concept of immutability, or simply that it is unbefitting to God's majesty to envisage Him as experiencing certain emo- tions [Summa Contra Gentiles 89]), this argument is the most interesting because of an analytic shift upheld by an implicit belief in the suitability of discussing both God and mankind in the same terms. Aquinas bases his argument that God cannot be passible on a thorough examination of the phenomenon of emotion, or what he calls "passiones animae ." The soul undergoes an emotional experience through its union with the body, for "passion strictly so called cannot therefore be experienced by the soul except in the sense that the whole person, the matter-soul com- posite, undergoes it" (Summa Theologiae Iallae 22:1c). Aquinas differenti- ates between several different forms of passibility, but whether he is discuss- ing passio animalis , which can be equated with what we would call an emo- tion, or passio corporate, which is in effect what we would call a feeling, the result with regard to our discussion is identical (De Veritate 26:2c).6 Aquinas hence concludes that without corporeality there is no emotion. From this analysis of human passibility Aquinas argues apriori that God cannot expe- rience emotions, for He cannot experience the physical manifestations im- plicit within those emotions: Every passion of the appetite is accompanied by a bodily change, for instance in respect of the contraction or dilation of the heart or something of the kind. But none of these can possibly happen in God, since He is not a body nor a power in a body [...]. Therefore there is no passion of the appetite in Him.</page><page sequence="4">500 Neil D. Graves (Summa Contra Gentiles 89) Aquinas, however, was not unaware that the Bible entertained many ref- erences to God's expressing such emotions as anger, love, and repentance, and that as a theologian he must struggle directly with the scriptural text. Thus Aquinas is forced to undertake a change in tack. His solution was to apply different forms of the theory of accommodation to the text while dif- ferentiating between what he deemed suitable and unbefitting emotional traits for a Deity. Aquinas utilizes what I will call "analogous accommoda- tion" based on the linguistic figure of the simile to comprehend biblical ex- amples of emotion that are suitable to God and "metaphorical accommo- dation" to repudiate unbefitting scriptural references. In the first case, tex- tual references to emotions such as love, Aquinas argues, are not human-like emotions, for these would entail corporeality. They instead denote divine will-acts that appear to be the same as their human counterparts but are actually only analogous. Instead of being passiones animae they are "passions" of the intellective appetite, and in Aquinas' theology they are described as acts of the will unaccompanied by bodily changes: "We find in the intellective appetite, which is the will, operations specifically similar to those of the sen- sitive appetite, differing in this, that in the sensitive appetite they are passions, on account of its connection with a bodily organ, whereas in the intellective appetite they are pure operations" ( Summa Contra Gentiles 90). Love is thus an emotion of the sensitive appetite, yet it is also an act of the intellective appetite because it is the repose of the will in an object of spiritual affection. One of the fundamental premises behind this theory of analogous accommodation illustrates the division between epistemology and metaphysics apparent in the mainstream theory of accommodation. Meta- physically speaking, moral attributes are said to be located originally and fundamentally in God, and man possesses these attributes in a finite, subse- quent, and inferior way. Accordingly, God is love, and man also loves in a way inferior to the ultimate love of God. Epistemologically, however, the reverse is true. Man experiences directly only that inferior human love, and from knowledge thereof he posits the perfection of Goďs love. As an Aris- totelian empiricist, Aquinas succinctly states that "all our knowledge origi- nates from sense" ( Summa Theologiae la. 1:9c). Aquinas' analogous accom- modation interprets scriptural references to befitting divine passibility as divine will-acts of the intellective appetite, which though appearing like human emotion is in fact metaphysically different: "Loving, enjoying, and having pleasure are emotions when they signify activities of the sensitive appetite; not so, however, when they signify activities of the intellective ap- petite. It is in this last sense that they are attributed to God" (Summa Theo- logiae la. 20:1 ad 1).</page><page sequence="5">The Materiality of Milton's God 501 Aquinas, however, utilizes metaphorical accommodation to repudiate the literal interpretation of those scriptural passages that suggest unbefitting passibility to God, for these "other emotions which by their specific nature are inapplicable to God, are applied to God in Holy Writ, not indeed prop- erly, as we have shown, but metaphorically, on account of a likeness either of effects, or of some preceding emotion" ( Summa Contra Gentiles 91). In effect, both of these causes of metaphorical interpretation are the result of the traditional raison ďetre of accommodative practice - the textual com- munication of spiritual behavior in the guise of readily understandable material forms. God is thus devoid in any metaphysical sense of the major- ity of what we would call emotions. However, they are sometimes metaphor- ically ascribed to God for one of two reasons: because of "some preceding emotion," when it would seem that God should be, for instance, sad&gt; because something unfortunate has befallen a person He loves; or because of "a like- ness in effects," which Aquinas describes by offering the example that "we are wont to punish when we are angry, so that punishment becomes a sign of anger; therefore it is punishment that is signified by the term anger, when anger is attributed to God" ( Summa Theologiae la. 19:1 lc). As Marcel Sarot states, such metaphorical accommodation of divine passibility has the attrac- tive characteristic of retaining unsullied the reader's faith in the veracity of the Word of God: [. . .] literally taken, "God is angry" is false. It draws attention, however, to the fact that God punishes sinners, and the literal statement "God punishes sinners" is true. From a theological point of view, this interpretation of as- criptions of passibility to God has one advantage: one can accept the bibli- cal metaphors which seem to ascribe passibility to God without having to take the undesired consequences seriously. (149) Milton, of course, is not commonly thought of as a reader of Aquinas, only mentioning him once in Areopagitica as a teacher of less worth than the sage and serious Edmund Spenser. Nevertheless, Aquinas' influence on later theo- logians and Reformation scholars whom Milton did respect is distinctly dis- cernible. While Milton is traditionally thought to be more Augustinián than Thomistic in his theology, this is true predominantly with regard to Chris- tian doctrine rather than metaphysics. In the latter Milton often owes more to Aquinas and hence to Aristotle than is generally believed. Aquinas' thesis highlights several important similarities. His principle of the "matter-soul composite," which is the metaphysical basis of his theory of human emotional reaction, dates back to Tertullian's only work of truly innovative thinking, De Anima : The soul certainly sympathises with the body, and shares in its pain, when-</page><page sequence="6">502 Neil D. Graves ever it is injured by bruises, and wounds, and sores: the body, too, suffers with the soul [porro et animam compati corpori , cui laeso ictibus vulneribus ulceri- bus condolescity et corpus animae] , and is united with it (whenever it is afflicted with anxiety, distress, or love) in the loss of vigour which its companion sus- tains, whose shame and fear it testifies by its own blushes and paleness. (De Anima 420; Tertulliani De Anima 6)7 Milton was uncommonly insistent on the metaphysical inseparability of body and soul, and indeed this monism is at the root of Milton's notorious doc- trinal heresies such as anti-Trinitarianism. When arguing concerning the creation of man in De Doctrina , Milton is explicitly clear: "The idea that the spirit of man is separate from his body, so that it may exist somewhere in isolation, complete and intelligent, is nowhere to be found in scripture, and is plainly at odds with nature and reason" ( CPW 6:319). Well aware that in this matter he was at odds with current philosophical opinion, Milton ex- amines the point in detail: Man is a living being, intrinsically and properly one and individual. He is not double or separable; not, as is commonly thought, produced from and composed of two different and distinct elements, soul and body. On the contrary, the whole man is the soul, and the soul the whole man: a body, in other words, or individual substance, animated, sensitive, and rational. ( CPW 6:318) It is upon this unpopular theory of "matter-soul composite" that Aquinas based his argument that God cannot be passible because passibility neces- sarily entails corporeality. Milton makes no such case regarding either God's passibility or corporeality, but in De Doctrina he forms a radically sugges- tive argument concerning the creation of man in Goďs own image and like- ness, directly stating that God modeled Adam's physical form on His own external appearance: God is said to have created man in his own image, after his own likeness , Gen. i. 26, and not only his mind but also his external appearance (unless the same words mean something different when they are used again in Gen. v. 3: Adam begot his son after his own likeness , in his own image). ( CPW 6:135-36) It is in this passage that Milton argues for the acceptance of theomorphism and theopathy, and this is based on his explicit rejection of all previous forms of scriptural accommodation and the application of his own idiosyncrati- cally literal theory of biblical interpretation. For Aquinas the "matter-soul composite" of man proves a priori that an incorporeal Deity cannot be pas- sible. In Milton's thinking the fact that "the whole man is the soul," and that</page><page sequence="7">The Materiality of Milton's God 503 God modeled both man's mind and external appearance after His own like- ness, is strongly suggestive of substantial metaphysical links between God and His chief creation. As is evident throughout Paradise Lost and chapter 2 of De Doctrina , Milton's God is emphatically passible, and in light of Aquinas' thinking this brings interesting evidence to the thesis that Milton's God is not only passible but also material. Milton may have derived his thoughts concerning a material Deity from a much more orthodox and important source. In De Ecclesiastico Dogmate Gennadius of Marseilles classes Tertullian with the Anthropomorphites, the Audiani, and Melito of Sardis as purveyors of belief in the corporeality of God. While repudiating in Adversus Marcionem the view that the Bible speaks of two Gods, a judgmental one in the Old Testament and a loving one re- vealed through Christ in the New Testament,8 Tertullian promotes a num- ber of doctrines that henceforth were considered either metaphysically un- derdeveloped or simply unbefitting to God's majesty. Milton had read Ter- tulliano Adversus Marcionem and considered it in his first published pam- phlet, Of Reformation, as well as naming it twice in Tetrachordon and once in Colasterion ( CPW 1:552; 2:664, 694, 736). Tertullian contends that God is entirely passible and that He experiences not only such emotions as love and forgiveness but also those commonly regarded as of dubious merit, in- cluding anger, exasperation, annoyance, indignation, and hostility. Tertul- lian conducts this argument by upholding the analogy between God and man as living substances, and like Milton he is careful to emphasize that his mode of argumentation is theomorphic and not anthropomorphic. As does Mil- ton, Tertullian grounds his analogy in that most fundamental of verses, Gen- esis 1:26, and thereby seeks to understand correctly the nature of the God/ man relationship. Arguing against the anthropomorphism of Marcion, Ter- tullian reasons that "since you no less acknowledge that man by God's breath- ing was made into a living soul, and not that God was so made by man, it is highly inconsistent of you to put human characteristics in God rather than divine characteristics in man, and to clothe God with man's image rather than man with God's" (133). From this biblical rejection of anthropomorphism in Adversus Mar- cionem &gt; Tertullian similarly repudiates anthropopathy and maintains that the directional alignment of his analogy is from God to man and not from man to God: "O these fools, who from things human form conjectures about things divine, and because in mankind passions [. . .] are taken to be of a corruptive character, suppose that in God also they are of the same quality" (131). Having upheld the traditional analogy between God and man, and after carefully designating the direction of this relationship, Tertullian forms a metaphysical argument to explain how God can be passible in a pure man- ner. It is the nature of the metaphysical substance of the being that desig-</page><page sequence="8">504 Neil D. Graves nates the nature of that being's passibility and corporeality: Distinguish the substances, and assign to each its own sensations, as diverse as the substances demand, even though they are seen to make use of the same terminology [...]. And as in man it is the corruptibility of the human sub- stance which makes these a cause of corruption, so it is in God the incorrupt- ibility of the divine substance which makes them no cause of corruption. [. . .] So then the image of God in man is to be understood in this fashion, that the human mind has the same emotions and sensations as God has, yet not of the same quality as God has: in accordance with their substance both their actuality and their consequences are far apart. (131, 133) Tertullian recognizes the accommodated nature of biblical language that describes God as corporealized and passible, but he rejects an accommodated hermeneutic that explains away the relationship between words and their normally accepted meaning. The latter is a traditional theory of accommo- dation based on the concept of metaphor; Tertullian instead defends an ac- commodated hermeneutic grounded in the idea of analogy, from which metaphysical premise follows the analogy between the attributes and form of God and man: We read of God's right hand, his eyes, his feet: yet these are not to be sup- posed exactly the same as mans, just because they partake of the same des- ignation. Great is the unlikeness of divine body and human, though their members are identical in name: equally great must be the difference of di- vine mind and human, though their sensations are referred to in the same terms. [. . .] All these [emotions] he [God] experiences in his own particular manner, that manner in which it is seeming for him to experience them: and because of him man also experiences the same, himself no less in his own particular manner. (133) In the Latin text Tertullian uses "corporis" to describe the divine body in his analogy with the human body, an extremely physical reference: "Quan- ta erit diversitas divini corporis et humāni." In De Trinitate , chapter 5, No- vatian follows Tertullian s line in accepting that God really does exhibit and experience those emotions commonly thought of as negative, and he agrees that this is possible due to the difference between Gods and man s substance: "If we read of His wrath, and consider certain descriptions of His indigna- tion, and learn that hatred is asserted of Him, yet we are not to understand these to be asserted of Him in the sense in which they are human vices. For all these things, although they may corrupt man, cannot at all corrupt the divine power" (308). Having agreed with Tertullian on this rather unusual point, Novatian then realigns himself with orthodoxy and argues that Goďs passibility is the product of His perfect substance, which is "constructed as-</page><page sequence="9">The Materiality of Milton's God 505 suredly of no associations of bodily parts," and thus entirely differentiated from "the corruptibility of the body, and matter itself" (309), effectively breaking any analogy between God and creation. The rationale of this in- terpretation becomes clear in the following chapter where Novatian elabo- rates on his understanding of the theory of accommodation which is entirely traditional in its form, being both metaphorical and condescending in its understanding of the God/man relationship. II This initial agreement between Novatian and Tertullian regarding divine passibility, and their subsequent disagreement regarding the metaphysical basis underlying this point, is enlightening in relation to Milton's statement in De Doctrina that "God in his most simple nature is a SPIRIT" ( CPW 6: 140). This statement is potentially difficult to reconcile with the many others in the Miltonie œuvre regarding aspects of God's corporeality and passibility. I propose, however, that it owes more to Tertullian's theory of God as Spirit, and to his early patristic conception of divine metaphysics, than to the later orthodox designation that I have illustrated from Novatian. Novatian is in the fold of orthodox theology by using the terms "spirit" and "body" as metaphysically dichotomous, and his signifying God as Spirit excludes Him from possessing any material form or cause: "For he is simple and without any corporeal commixture, being wholly of that essence, whatever it be, which He alone knows constitutes His being, since He is called Spirit" (309). 9 In Adversus Praxeas Tertullian attacks the heresy that the members of the Godhead are all one and the same, as well as that God the Father entered Mary and was born as Christ. In chapter 7 Tertullian considers the biblical state- ment that "God is Spirit," proceeding with arguments that are surprisingly similar - and in places identical - to the idiosyncratic mode of thought pur- sued by Milton in chapters 2 and 7 of De Doctrina . Milton had read Adver- sus Praxeas and cites it in OfPrelatical Episcopacy while considering the na- ture of the substance of God ( CPW 1:645). Indeed, Tertullian's being such an early Church Father made Milton particularly susceptible to following him. In his treatise's seventh chapter Tertullian speculates as to the meta- physical substance of God and the Son, with particular reference to the idea of material cause in the act of creation. Tertullian posits in Adversus Praxeas that God Himself is a substance, and he is explicit that God possesses an actual body. The major philosophical premise is that nothing can come from nothing , and, although Tertullian does not at this time contribute to the vast debate concerning creatio ex Deo as compared with creatio ex nihilo (he is primarily considering the creation of the Son and not the universe), his argument is conducted in the same terms.</page><page sequence="10">506 Neil D. Graves He states: I, on the contrary, contend that nothing empty and void could have come forth from God, seeing that it is not put forth from that which is empty and void; nor could that possibly be devoid of substance which has proceeded from so great a substance, and has produced such mighty substances. [. . .] How could it be, that He Himself is nothing, without whom nothing was made? How could He who is empty have made things which are solid, and He who is void have made things which are full, and He who is incorporeal have made things which have body? (345-46) In effect, Tertullian reasons backwards from empirical data to primary causes. The created world is material and therefore must have been made by a ma- terial being; the Son is that material being, and he too was created necessar- ily by a material being; God Himself, therefore, is a material being. Milton's cosmogony, of course, is firmly of the creatio ex Deo variety. It is also in chapter 7 of his thesis that Milton, like Tertullian, discusses the cre- ation of the universe with reference to the Son as the agent of creation. Milton is clear and consistent that there are four causes for everything - ef- ficient, material, formal, final - and, like Tertullian, he reasons backwards a posteriori that the laws governing the universe hold true for the creation of that universe: "No agent can act externally unless there is something, and something material, which can be acted upon, [and so] it is apparent that God could not have created this world out of nothing" ( CPW 6:307). Mil- ton is explicit in declaring that God contains and comprehends within Him- self all four of the causes including the material cause, something vehemently denied by most theologians. Consequently Milton takes up Tertulliano cue that nothing can come of nothing - "The material cause must be either God or nothing. But nothing is no cause at all" - and reiterates the idea that cre- ated matter is "a substance, and could only have been derived from the source of all substance" ( CPW 6:308). Tertullian faces the problem head-on in Adversus Praxeas and considers the question of God's ontology as Spirit while possessing material cause. His solution is unusual not only in its direct repudiation of the traditional di- chotomy between spirit and body but also for his ascription of both materi- al cause and actual corporeality to God: "For who will deny that God is a body, although ťGod is a Spirit'? For Spirit has a bodily substance of its own kind, in its own form" (346). Some critics, such as Ernest Evans in his edi- tion of Tertulliano Treatise Against Praxeas , attempt to exculpate Tertullian from the serious implications of the charge of heresy by claiming that "when he says that God is corpus he means no more than that he really exists: he cannot conceive of substantia except as corpus" (235). However, this does not seem to be Tertullian's primary point at this juncture; moreover, he takes</page><page sequence="11">The Materiality of Milton's God 507 the point much further. He does not state that spirit is a form of body, or the form of the body, or attempt to amalgamate spirit and body together, but rather is explicit in his inclusion of body in his definition of God's substan- tia as Spirit. Tertullian certainly can conceive of substantia as something other than body, for he conceives of it as spirit. The point is that spirit contains body - that they are not mutually exclusive terms - and that the concept of substantia includes both body and spirit. Tertullian goes on to illustrate that even the angels possess God's substance, previously defined as both body and spirit, as well as His one preeminent Son: "Now, even if invisible things, whatsoever they be, have both their substance and their form in God, where- by they are visible to God alone, how much more shall that which has been sent forth from His substance not be without substance!" (346). Milton's discussion of God's ontology in the identical context of His cre- ative power is revealingly similar and worth quoting at length: But, you will say, body cannot emanate from spirit. My reply is, much less can it emanate from nothing. Moreover spirit, being the more excellent sub- stance, virtually, as they say, and eminently contains within itself what is clear- ly the inferior substance; in the same way as the spiritual and rational facul- ty contains the corporeal, that is, the sentient and vegetative faculty. For not even God's virtue and efficiency could have produced bodies out of nothing (as it is vulgarly believed he did) unless there had been some bodily force in his own substance, for no one can give something he has not got. And in- deed, St. Paul himself did not hesitate to attribute something bodily to God, Col. ii. 9: the whole fulness of the Godhead dwells in him bodily. And it is not any more incredible that a bodily force should be able to issue from a spiri- tual substance, than that something spiritual should be able to rise from a body; and that is what we trust will happen to our own bodies at the resur- rection. (CPW 6: 309-10) The similarities between the two texts are evident. It is interesting that Mil- ton explicitly utilizes the orthodox analogy between God and man that seeks to circumscribe the epistemological gulf between our empirical knowledge of mankind and our speculations regarding a transcendent Deity. Howev- er, this brings into play all the hermeneutic problems that the theory of ac- commodation was designed to alleviate but that in essence it further com- plicates. Milton nevertheless upholds this analogy by his reasoning that God possesses both spirit and body in the same way as the spiritual and rational faculty contains the corporeal in humankind. As I have stated, the question revolves around the interpretation of Mil- ton's statement that "God in his most simple nature is a SPIRIT." Immedi- ately following this he adds that "it is shown what a spirit is, or rather, what it is not: Isa. xxxi. 3: flesh , not spirit ; Luke xxiv. 39: a spirit does not have flesh</page><page sequence="12">508 Neil D. Graves and bones ." At first glance these comments would seem to prove Goďs im- materiality, or at least His incorporeality, and endorse an orthodox concep- tion of the Deity, but this is unlikely on two counts. First, the context of the passage concerns the issue of God's simplicity, and it is posited by Milton in his argument concerning Goďs substance with a view to proving his non- Trinitarian conjecture that God, Christ, and the Spirit possess one substan- tia but three essentiae . The statement therefore was intended to "be under- stood [such] that the essence of God, since it is utterly simple, allows noth- ing to be compounded with it" ( CPW 6:140), rather than to refute a materi- alistic interpretation of God. Second, it is clear that in Milton s metaphysics the denial of "somatomorphic" corporeality does not preclude the attribu- tion of materiality: the angels of Paradise Lost are not literally embodied with flesh and blood, but they are undeniably material.10 Indeed, Milton actually makes the statement, "Angels are spirits," and describes them as "ethereal by nature" ( CPW 6:314); this parallels his earlier statement regarding God as a spirit and is not intended to suggest that angels are immaterial in substance. In fact his elaboration of monist ontology in the rest of the treatise makes Milton's position almost unquestionable. Certainly in Paradise Lost angels eat human food and have some form of sexual intercourse, all with Milton's specific direction that such descriptions are not to be interpreted as merely accommodated metaphors - "And to their viands fell, nor seemingly / The angel, nor in mist, the common gloss / Of theologians, but with keen des- patch / Of real hunger" (5.434-37). In the poem angels are explicitly mate- rial beings. This presents an intriguing paradox: the overwhelmingly he- retical treatise is, at least in its explicit statements on angelology, less hetero- doxical than Paradise Lost , which, until recently and to some critics even now, is the supreme poetic statement of the orthodox Protestant faith. Ill It is my contention that the subject matter of Milton's ontology includes his conception of God, such that his metaphysical speculations concerning the gradations of the monistic Weltanschauung encompass both what is cre- ated and what is uncreated - both the universe and God Himself. Milton is not the only theologian to have suggested this, and an interesting compari- son is Augustine's inclusion of God in his use of "omnia" in reflecting on creation.11 The implications of such a premise are that God's Being is not excluded from Milton's Scale of Nature and that, when Milton uses such terms as spirit, matter, body, and substance, he uses them in the same man- ner concerning God as he does with reference to what God has created. This is a point denied by virtually all Milton critics. Robert Van Volson Rice, Jr. is typical in his distinction of Milton's God from His creation with regard to</page><page sequence="13">The Materiality of Milton's God 509 ontology, and this philosophical differentiation leads naturally to a linguis- tic distinction in the application of the theory of accommodation: "When Milton portrays heavenly creatures as having man-like behavior, he is using a kind of symbolism in which symbols are essentially like the thing symbol- ized. It would seem that such a portrayal calls for accommodation of a vastly different order than that required to portray God" (5). However, consider- ing that I have rejected Milton as a practitioner of traditional accommodat- ed hermeneutics, it is not at all strange to propose that Milton's God is meta- physically connected to His creation. Certainly what is undeniable is that Milton's unequivocal endorsement of the creatio ex Deo theory entails a be- lief that all substance derives its existence from God Himself, and once in- dependent of God and with the imposition of forms it constitutes the ma- terial of the universe. In this way substance is ontologically linked to God Himself in a manner far closer than with orthodox creatio ex nihilo theo- ries.12 This theory demands the close scrutiny of several Miltonie texts for sub- stantiation. The first and most important is that quoted at length above concerning the relationship between spirit and body and the creation of matter from God's substance, crucially the idea that "spirit, being the more excellent substance, virtually, as they say, and eminently contains within it- self what is clearly the inferior substance." The phrase "virtually [. . .] and eminently" has been the subject of considerable critical disagreement and, together with the interpretation of this whole passage, has led scholars to contradictory conclusions regarding the materiality or immateriality of the Miltonie Deity. What is undisputed is that the philosophical terms virtual- iter and eminenter ( WJM 15:24) are scholastic in origin and, as J. H. Adam- son notes, are "used to indicate that a thing possessed or contained another thing in a more perfect or higher manner than was required for a formal possession of it" (765). However, what is not often noted is that Milton found scholastic metaphysical thought and terms distasteful.13 From his early days at Cambridge where he wrote his third Prolusion titled An Attack on the Scho- lastic Philosophy y until his publication of The Likeliest Means to Remove Hire- lings Out of the Church in 1659 toward the end of his public career in poli- tics, Milton condemned theological arguments conducted by way of "scho- lastical trash" (CPW 7:317). He concludes this attack in Of True Religion (1673) whereby many orthodox or commonplace theological terms were dismissed as "Scholastic Notions, not to be found in Scripture" ( CPW 8:424- 25). It is therefore in no way certain that Milton would have used these terms in their specific and particular scholastic sense. Nevertheless, what is cru- cial here is whether in Milton's metaphysics God as Spirit merely contains materiality as a higher cause possesses in a higher manner a lower cause, or whether God's being a spiritual substance is therefore also necessarily a</page><page sequence="14">510 Neil D. Graves material substance. Typically critics have conjectured that the primary reason why Milton in this passage used such scholastic terminology was to avoid the conclusion that God was a material being, suggesting merely that He possesses material cause: He [Milton] then offers a suggested explanation, exceedingly simple, but one which shows again that he is attempting to avoid attributing corporeality to God [...]. When Milton says that a spirit virtually and eminently contains matter, he simply means that spirit is a higher cause and thus, in a higher manner, contains the lower cause in itself even as God "virtually and emi- nently" contains all things within himself. (Adamson 764-65; see also Curry 34) God thus possesses material cause but not matter itself, and Adamson at- tempts to explain the mechanics of Milton's cosmology by Goďs exercise of His material potency, which is actualized in the form of substance by the process of emanation. However, this explanation does not seem to explain the whole of the passage in question, and indeed only takes about half of Milton's sentences into account. Three in particular are, I believe, of crucial importance. The first is appended to Milton's statement concerning virtual and eminent possession by a semicolon, and it forms an analogous explan- atory statement to the relationship between the more excellent and the in- ferior substance of God. The second is Milton's quotation from Colossians 2:9, which, paradoxically because of Milton's contradictory interpretations of this verse elsewhere in De Doctrina , strongly suggests that he really was positing materiality in God. The third statement is the last in that paragraph and concerns God's infinity, which is incomplete if anything that can be added to it is excluded from it. The first of these points concerns the analogy that Milton makes between God as a spirit and the spiritual and rational faculty. Most importantly, this is another example in De Doctrina of one of Milton's favorite hermeneuti- cal devices. He forms an analogy between God and man, or between the divine frame of reference and the empirically knowable one, and in form this analogy is identical to that I considered above from Genesis 1:26 concern- ing the creation of man in God's image, just as Adam begot his son in his own image ( CPW 6:135-36). Milton argues: Moreover spirit, being the more excellent substance, virtually, as they say, and eminently contains within itself what is clearly the inferior substance; in the same way as the spiritual and rational faculty contains the corporeal, that is, the sentient and vegetative faculty. ( CPW 6:309; my emphasis)</page><page sequence="15">The Materiality of Milton's God 511 What is vital are the subjects to which the two parts of the analogy refer. In the first sentence the spirit in question is unquestionably God Himself, for the context is of the creation of the universe by the emanation of body from God's spirit. In the second sentence the spiritual and rational faculty that contains the sentient and vegetative faculty must refer either to God Him- self or to aspects of His creation such as angels or men. Now if it refers to God, this immediately clarifies the issue by stating that God's faculty does "contain the corporeal," and thus God possesses not only material cause but also materiality. If instead it refers to aspects of God's creation, which in fact I think it does, then Milton has established an analogy between the two realms he has posited to elucidate the nature of God. It is clear from even a cursory consideration of Milton's metaphysics that in the created universe all things belong in a monist hierarchical scale of nature wherein the higher form of substance called spirit includes within itself the lower form of body. Accord- ingly, as I noted above, Miltonie angels are spirits and yet, composed of matter, are possessed of corporeality. The result is that Milton in this anal- ogy has equated the concept of God as spirit with that of spirit in the creat- ed universe, and he has implied that God does possess materiality in the same way that created spirits possess materiality. The second elucidatory statement is Milton's quotation from Colossians, which is fascinating because Milton's inconsistent and contradictory inter- pretations of this verse indicate that he is asserting divine materiality. In the passage in question Milton appends this interpretation to the scriptural verse: "And indeed, St. Paul himself did not hesitate to attribute something bodily to God, Col. ii. 9: the whole fulness of the Godhead dwells in him bodily ." This statement certainly suggests materiality, although it is rather recondite. However, Milton quotes this text from Colossians at least three other times in De Doctrina , once in chapter 2 in a very minor note regarding interpreta- tion of the word Theotes and twice again in chapters 5 and 14 ( CPW 6:137, 273, 419). In these passages Milton is attempting to clarify his position re- garding the exact make-up of Christ's divine and human constitution. In these instances Milton interprets the scriptural text in its proper con- text, the nature of Christ, and this is obvious from a consideration of Colos- sians 2:5-12. In the former use Milton equates the text with the substance of God the Father, twisting the Scripture to fit his current thinking on the materiality of God. What this shows is that Milton, having made a philo- sophical analysis of God's substance leading him to posit materiality, now searches for a scriptural text that he can press into service to reinforce his argument. It would seem unlikely that Milton would utilize this text, which he so obviously uses in its correct context elsewhere (thus knowing its "prop- er" meaning), if he were not enlisting it to prove his point that God is mate- rial. It does not seem plausible that Milton's point is merely that God pos-</page><page sequence="16">512 Neil D. Graves sesses material cause, for this is to a degree theologically orthodox - at least to the extent that all theologians must explain how God created matter. In- stead, as Reesing also surmises, the conclusion must be that Milton wanted to suggest actual divine materiality: "There is no need to imagine that Mil- ton is dishonest; he is only impetuous, and impetuous in a way instructive to us. Firmly convinced that the Bible teaches Goďs corporeality, and with no thought for anything but the immediate purpose of defending his point, Milton seizes upon Colossians 2:9 as explicit and authoritative proof" (169). The third and final statement to be considered from the end of this same important passage is that concerning Goďs infinity. Milton notes that God cannot be infinite if there is anything that can be added to Him. It is here that it is perhaps most clear that Milton is not referring merely to material cause but also to materiality itself. Indeed, it is an inescapable conclusion that in Milton's metaphysics material cause necessarily entails the possession of materiality. Milton argues: Lastly, I do not see how God can truthfully be called infinite if there is any- thing which might be added to him. And if something did exist, in the na- ture of things, which had not first been from God and in God, then that might be added to him. (CPW 6:310) In Milton's metaphysical system matter is inordinately important. Few phi- losophers or theologians have posited a more materialistic system, wherein even the most traditionally immaterial subjects - angels, heaven, devils, di- vine chariots - are uncontestedly created out of matter and remain ontolog- ically material. While a materialist angelology has a long Platonic tradition, as Robert H. West makes clear, it is virtually impossible to find a Christian philosopher who posits such a comprehensive materialist monism of the order of Milton's. In chapter 2 of De Doctrina Milton states that "God is PRESENT EVERYWHERE" as "a consequence of his infinity" ( CPW 6:144). One is reminded that the definition of original matter is the substance freed from God's virtue, which becomes fully independent of God's substantia , the basis of Milton's creatio ex Deo theory; furthermore, in Paradise Lost it is quite clear that at the end of time "God shall be all in all" once again (3.341). In light of Milton's inordinate materialism, it would seem ludicrous in inter- preting Milton's contention that God's infinity includes all things, and that nothing can be added to Him, if this totality did not include that most pri- mary of all created things - matter. It is a part of Milton's justification of his creatio ex Deo theory that the traditional creatio ex nihilo version posits a substance - "nothing" (for Milton at times seems to interpret rather na- ively nihilo as a substance outside of God) - that conflicts with ideas of God's infinity and unity. Milton's belief in God as the Absolute has often been noted</page><page sequence="17">The Materiality of Milton's God 513 to land him in philosophical difficulties, and this is a prime example. In the same way that Milton's anti-Trinitarian beliefs can be traced back to his understanding of God's unity and immutability, so too his belief in God's materiality is required by his understanding of God's infinity. Even in the supposedly less heretical Paradise Lost , in a most difficult passage, Milton illustrates his emanationist theory of creation and expresses God's infinity as extending throughout the material creation: Boundless the deep, because I who fill Infinitude, nor vacuous the space. Though I uncircumscribed my self retire, And put not forth my goodness, which is free To act or not [. . .]. (7.168-72) This interpretation of Milton's use of the terms "virtually" and "eminent- ly" from De Doctrina is entirely supported by his use of the same terms in Paradise Lost . In Book 8 Adam plucks up the courage to ask Raphael whether angels express their love in the same way as humans through sexual inter- course: "Love not the heavenly spirits, and how their love / Express they, by looks only, or do they mix / Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch?" (615- 17). In this passage "virtual" is used in the old scholastic sense that the OED defines as "In respect of essence or effect, apart from actual form or specific manner," such that "virtual" is here opposed to "immediate," for sex through looks only would be merely virtual sex without form or actual expression, as opposed to the immediacy of "mix[ing] / Irradiance" through physical contact. However, Raphael's reply states that angelic sex is experienced "In eminence," which is distinctly not used in the scholastic sense "to denote that a thing possesses, or contains any other in a more perfect or higher manner than is required to a formal possession thereof" (OED).14 Such usage express- es the idea of "to the highest degree," which Milton reveals manifestly includes the formal and actual. Raphael replies to Adam: Whatever pure thou in the body enjoy st (And pure thou wert created) we enjoy In eminence, and obstacle find none Of membrane, joint, or limb, exclusive bars: Easier than air with air, if spirits embrace, Total they mix, union of pure with pure Desiring [...]. (622-28) Perhaps Milton was correcting Adam's scholastic definition of "virtually" with Raphael's less abstruse use of "eminently." Juxtaposed immediately with "virtual [ly]," the phrase "In eminence" almost unquestionably refers to the</page><page sequence="18">514 Neil D. Graves philosophical term "eminently," and not merely in the common sense of "su- perlatively." This is made all the more likely because Milton also plays with the theological meaning of the word in Book 9 in the ironic statement by Eve to Adam concerning "This happy trial of thy love, which else / So eminently never had been known" (975-76). In the above-cited passage from Book 8, Milton presents the radical thesis that angels experience sex by a total com- mingling of substance, as opposed to "virtual" sex; hence "In eminence" or "eminently" does not exclude the scholastic senses of formal and actual pos- session. This evidence from Paradise Lost supports my reading of De Doc- trina : Goďs substance includes both virtually (in essence or effect) and em- inently (in a higher degree formally and actually) the inferior substance of matter. IV I thus have sought to reveal how Milton's statement that "God [. . .] is a SPIRIT" in no way precludes Him from also being a material Being in the sense that He both possesses material cause and includes within His Being the substance of matter, and a number of theological precedents support this belief. Indeed, the idea of God as wholly incorporeal and immaterial has been for centuries such a standard theological belief that it comes almost as a shock to discover that it was not a resolved tenet in early patristic theology.15 As considered above, Tertullian argues in Adversus Praxeas that God's method of creation entails His possession of substance, and thus materiality, and in Adversus Marcionem that God's form and sensations are analogous to hu- man ones, only pure and perfect as God's substance is pure and perfect. The starting point for this reasoning in Adversus Marcionem was his interpreta- tion of Genesis 1:26, involving the creation of man in God's image, and the question of the location of that image in man. In Contra Celsum Origen argues against the contention that the image of God is located in man's body as well as his soul, and for two interesting reasons: if it is in man's body only, then man's better part - his soul - is deprived of God's influence, and this is ludicrous; second, if God's image be in both man's body and soul, this necessitates that God also possess a body and soul, for the effect must be equal to the cause (see 405-06). As I have shown, Milton did actually believe that the image of God was located in both man's soul and body, and he was quite explicit in this belief. Following Origen's logic implicates one in a belief in the materiality of God, something that has implications for other theologians who interpret the Genesis verse likewise. In Adversus Haereses (both the title and its extreme- ly early composition - second century A.D. - would entice Milton to this work) Irenaeus argues that the image of God is reflected in all of man's spir-</page><page sequence="19">The Materiality of Milton's God 515 it, soul, and body: "[...] not merely a part of man was made in the likeness of God. Now the soul and the spirit are certainly apart of the man, but cer- tainly not the man; for the perfect man consists in the commingling and the union of the soul receiving the spirit of the Father, and the admixture of that fleshly nature which was moulded after the image of God." Irenaeus then elaborates upon this idea of the complete man and suggests a far more he- retical point in a rather novel argument. He maintains that the term "spir- itual" is merely one attribute of humankind and that a man is spiritual be- cause he partakes of the Spirit of God Himself, as the Scriptures tell, at cre- ation. However, man is not purely spiritual - he is also material - and could not be so unless he forsook his body, but then he would not be a man. If a man lost his body and became purely spiritual, he no longer would be a man, by definition a composite creature, but merely the spirit of a man or, most importantly, the Spirit of God. The implication here, although Irenaeus stops short of directly stating it, is that God also is composed of spirit and body, which is why when man was made in the image of God he was made so both in body and spirit, and that, just as the spirit of man derives from the Spirit of God, so too the body of man derives from the Body of God. To say that man is spirit is true but only partially true, and the implication is that to say God is Spirit is also true but does not encompass the whole of His Being. Irenaeus seems to suggest, like Milton, that the statement "God [. . .] is a SPIRIT" says far more than the statement "the Spirit of God": We do also hear many brethren in the church, [. . .] whom also the apostle terms "spiritual," they being spiritual because they partake of the Spirit, and not because their flesh has been stripped off and taken away, and because they have become purely spiritual. For if anyone take away the substance of flesh, that is, of the handiwork [of God] , and understand that which is purely spir- itual, such then would not be a spiritual man, but would be the spirit of a man, or the Spirit of God. (68) A further and fascinating example of the early Church's irresolution con- cerning the immateriality of God is evident from the scriptural text itself. Throughout the patristic period the Greek Septuagint version of the Scrip- tures was the primary translation of the Old Testament. Most interestingly, it posited the word "Pneuma" for Spirit; however, contrary to our conven- tional presuppositions concerning the abstract and immaterial connotations of this word, it had at that time a very strong Stoic meaning. The Stoics believed that God is Spirit, or Pneuma, and that this Pneuma is composed of matter. It seems that this word possessed such widespread Stoic conno- tations that Origen found it necessary to defend the eventually orthodox Christian concept of God against materiality. This he did twice, once in De Principiis (see 9) and also in the first major piece of scriptural exegesis ever</page><page sequence="20">516 Neil D. Graves written. In his Commentary on the Gospel of John Origen notes that the Sto- ic Deity, Pneuma, is "a body, [. . .] but He is a body spiritual and ethereal." Furthermore, the biblical word is evidently the same materialist term of Sto- icism, resulting in Christian heresy: "But we, by reason of our failure to see the consequences, if we say that God is a body and, on Scriptural grounds, a body of a certain kind, spirit or breath [Pneuma], consuming fire, light, on our refusal to admit the necessary consequences of this, shall appear foolish and awkward, as men who dispute what is quite evident." Origen's solution to this dilemma is to interpret such scriptural references according to the theory of accommodation ("consider what may be the intended meaning of calling God spirit or fire or light" [4] ) - an unbelievably ironic maneuver in that accommodation was instituted as a hermeneutic device to explain dis- paraging references to God's feet and hands, and similar anthropomor- phisms, and not to explaining (away) how God is a Spirit. Finally unable to shake off the Stoic connotations of Pneuma, Origen resorts to denying that the proposition "God is Spirit" is an ontological statement of Goďs Being, instead positing it as a divine quality that God bestows upon believers: He is too described as consuming fire, the term being understood from the physical fire which consumes physical material. Such seems to me to be the truth in regard to, God is a spirit [Pneuma] . For since we derive our life, this mediocre thing we commonly mean by the term, from the breath or spirit [Pneuma] , as the spirit or air about us breathes what we call in a bodily sense the breath of life; from that fact, I suppose, we have derived the use of the term spirit for God, who leads us into the real life. For the spirit is said in Scrip- ture to give life, and plainly it means the giving not of this middle life but of the more divine. (6-7) However one construes this unusual line of reasoning, a reader of the Scrip- tures in the early patristic period might well have interpreted the statement "God is Spirit" as suggesting that God is not incorporeal at all but a material Being. This, of course, would have been of great interest to a thinker such as Milton. He was uncommonly interested in the etymological origin of words, as is evident in A Treatise of Civil Power where Milton notes with glee "that heresie, by what it signifies in that language [Greek], is no word of evil note; meaning only the choise or following of any opinion good or bad in religion or any other learning" ( CPW 7:247). V In conclusion, this essay has presented evidence hitherto unconsidered that Milton believed in a Deity who not only possessed material cause but who also was in certain senses of the word material Himself. The weight of</page><page sequence="21">The Materiality of Milton's God 517 evidence, I would suggest, leads us to suspect that Milton's God is not onto- logically distinct from the materialistic monism that dominated the author's Weltanschauung . The whole of chapter 5 of De Doctrina , the treatise's long- est chapter by far and one of the most impassioned texts in all of Milton's writings, is devoted to arguing that "The Father and the Son are certainly not one in essence," that "He is called God's own Son simply because he had no Father but God," and that "God could certainly have refrained from the act of generation and remained true to his own essence" ( CPW 6:219, 208-09). In Milton's God, therefore, there is clearly "copresence" of both substance and essence, although it is the exact status of God's substance that I have ques- tioned. It comes as no surprise that till now no attempt has been made by Milton scholars to ascertain the quality of God's essence, as essentia is intrin- sically connected to form in his thinking. This is clear even from Milton's earliest works, for instance A Masque wherein man is encouraged on a course of metaphysical improvement up the hierarchical Scale of Nature, such that changes to the "soul's essence" are changes in "the outward shape" ( CSP 199). Paradise Lost is saturated with this same theory, proposing that formal es- sence is determined by ethics: Adam learns from Raphael that "By steps we may ascend to God" if he remains obedient, by which steadfastness "Your bodies may at last turn all to spirit, / Improved by tract of time" and be "converged . . .] / To proper substance" (5.512, 497-98, 292-93); Satan also experiences a formal change of his essentia , but it is an ontological "fall" down the ladder of being in which "spirits of purest light, / Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown" (6.660-61), as manifested by their very "essence to incar- nate and imbrute" (9.166), are visibly altered. Accordingly, while one can speculate as to the nature of Miltonie substan- tia , any investigation of God's essentia would necessitate an understanding of God's form, a seemingly impossible task, although "the fact that the Fa- ther has an essence implies a substance which admits the possibility of per- ception" (Jacobus 185-86). 16 Analyzing in the Artis Logicae the "mutual re- lation [that] obtains between description and the thing described," Milton makes a fascinating reference to Aristotle and quotes directly from the phi- losopher regarding God's Being. Once again questioning any ontological dichotomy between creator and created, Milton notes that Aristotle "says that certain animals are immortal ( Topics 4.2), and in the same chapter he calls God himself zonathanaton , that is, an immortal animal " ( CPW 8:315). Ap- parently for Milton the hierarchy of being goes to the very top. University of Botswana</page><page sequence="22">518 Neil D. Graves NOTES *The debate over the provenance of De Doctrina Christiana is ongoing and un- resolved, although Hunter is the lone voice denying Miltonie authorship. The issue raised by Hunter was answered by Barbara K. Lewalski, John T. Shawcross, Maurice Kelley, and Christopher Hill in the pages of Studies in English Literature, 1500-1900. The controversy was continued in Milton Studies , first by Paul R. Sellin in 1997 and responded to by Lewalski in 1998; it then progressed to Hunter and Selling "Respons- es" and "Further Responses," respectively, in Milton Quarterly a year later. The two most important contributions of late from either perspective are by Gordon Camp- bell, et al., and Hunter in his 1998 book. Other recent participants in the debate include Neil D. Graves, Michael Lieb, and in particular Stephen Fallon, who makes a crucial point: "The treatise [De Doctrina Christiana ], an invaluable quarry of Milton's engaged critical and theological intelligence, will be considerably more dif- ficult to use if scholars must in every article and every book rehearse yet once more the overwhelming reasons for accepting the work as Milton's" ("Milton's Armini- anism" 122). 2Recently Juliet Lucy Cummins has argued, erroneously I believe, that Milton's God has a twofold identity, a volitional transcendent deity and prime matter itself, yet both Paradise Lost and De Doctrina clearly demonstrate that original matter is fully independent from the deity of God. 3See, for example, Robins: "Milton's convictions that God is material, that cre- ation is ex deoy that free will derives from freed material, and that angels and men are of the same matter constitute a major heresy judged by Catholic and Protestant doctrine alike" (57); also Lewalski: "This ascription of materiality to God himself, and the concomitant refusal to distinguish fundamentally between angels and men, matter and spirit, is a foundation stone of Milton's theology and is perhaps his most significant and daring departure from orthodoxy" (Milton's Brief Epic 140). 4The primary instance is the entry under "Metaphysics" in A Milton Encyclope- dia edited by Hunter. Other critics include Reesing, although he claims that Mil- ton's materialism is probably not heretical, and Hill as the inveterate campaigner for radicalism. The latter yet fails to substantiate his brief statements with any persua- siveness: "Milton envisaged a material God, who derived a prime matter from his own substance"; and "His theory also runs the risk of appearing to equate God and matter" ( Milton 326, 328). There are also some critics who are extremely hostile to Milton per se, such as Walter Bagehot who adds this heterodoxy to his list of the au- thor's failings: "From some passages it would seem that he actually thought of God as having ťthe members and form' of a man" (339-40). Other Miltonists who have acknowledged the materiality of Milton's God but have not provided a compelling argument for that contention include Kerrigan (193-262), Fallon (Milton Among the Philosophers ), and Rogers (103-76). 5I argue that "theomorphic" and "theopathetic" are the correct terms to describe Milton's belief in the depiction of God's person and attributes, although I am aware that these terms were not in circulation until the nineteenth century. See Lieb's "Reading God: Milton and the Anthropopathetic Tradition" and Graves's "Milton and the Theory of Accommodation."</page><page sequence="23">The Materiality of Milton's God 519 6Sarot discusses the whole argument of the relationship between divine passibility and corporeality and its relevance to modern concepts of God. He argues that this is a "live" theological issue: "There is a very strong connection between the phenom- ena we commonly designate as emotions and physiological changes, and thus that passibilist theologians cannot without argument take it for granted that incorpore- al passibility is possible" (130). 7Tertullian, like Milton but unlike Aquinas, considered the soul to be corporeal, and it is in this context that he argues for the emotional interaction of soul and body: "[...] bodily likeness and unlikeness are caught and reflected by the soul also. It is therefore as being corporeal that it is susceptible of likeness and unlikeness" (De Anima 419-20). 8It is evident from Donne's Easter Monday sermon of 1622 that the identifica- tion of two discernibly different Christian Gods was still current in the seventeenth century, and Donne even makes reference to Marcion (93-94). 9It is noteworthy that in Milton's description of God as a Spirit he also defines God as "simple" in essence, but he makes no attempt as Novatian does to clarify this as being "without any corporeal commixture." 10Even thinkers like Origen who are typically hostile to Milton's position admit that all creatures have bodies and that both angels and men are composed of the same matter. See Origen, De Principiis 78-79. 11 Cum omnia Deusfecerit, quare non aequalia fecerit. Quia non essent omnia, si essent aequalia: non enim essent multa rerum genera, quibus conficitur universi- tas, primas et secundas, et deinceps usque ad ultimas ordinatas habens creaturas: et hoc est quod dicitur, omnia" (Augustine 27). 12It is hence an eminently viable line of argument that belief in creatio ex Deo necessitates a belief in divine materiality. A. S. P. Woodhouse forms the same con- clusion: "Among the inescapable implications which Milton does not seek to evade is the admission of an element of corporeality in the Deity" (222). It is thus my contention, contra J. H. Adamson, that Milton posited the materiality of God in an ex Deo cosmology before Spinoza, although it is possible that the two exchanged their ideas through a common correspondent, Henry Oldenburg. Adamson is also mis- led as to the question of the materiality of God in a monist metaphysic. He fails to perceive that it is perhaps the most important of all questions as to whether Mil- ton's God is posited within or outside of this philosophical system: "The question of materiality in God has no meaning in a system of metaphysical monism" (764). 13C. S. Lewis is one of the few who note that Milton "shared to the full the Philis- tine attitude of the Humanists to scholastic philosophy" (87). 14Furthermore, the OED states that "the word is nearly equivalent to virtually ," which is manifestly not the case in Milton's usage. 15Grace M. Jantzen has been an outspoken advocate of the theory that belief in the Christian God as a material Being does not preclude orthodox Christian faith, and à la Milton she argues that often some tenets of faith now accepted as central to the Christian creed were missing entirely in the early days of the Church. 16See also Rumrich's comment on the connection between the form and essence of God: "The reason we cannot define God's essence, to use Aristotle more precise- ly, rests in our inability to comprehend his form" (222).</page><page sequence="24">520 Neil D.
