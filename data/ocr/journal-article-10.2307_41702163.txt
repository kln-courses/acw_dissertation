<plain_text><page sequence="1">TRIPURAVADHA : THE SUPREMACY OF THE YOGÎ By SUBHASH AMANO The story of Šiva humiliating the three sons of the great Asura Tfiraka by destroying their three cities is found in two versions in the MahãbhSrata ( == MĎh )l : a very short one (7. 173.52-58), and a longer one (8.24. 1-124 ).3 We also find a " moralized version " ( 12. 283. 7-17 ).3 Hence among the many names of Šiva we have the following : Tripura-anta-kara ( 2. 17. 19 ), Tripura-han ( 3. 82. 17 ), Tripura-ardana ( 3. 220. 8 ), Tripura-mardana ( 3. 104. 10), Tripura-nSsana ( 13. 130. 37 ). The longer version tries to link the narration of this episode to the main story of the Epic. The Kauravas and PSndavas are preparing for the great encounter. The former consider Karna as their best warrior, while the latter pin their hopes on Arjuna. Arjuna is lucky to have Krsna himself as his charioteer. The Kauravas have still to find one for Karna, who wants Šalya to take up this job as he considers him superior ( abhyadhika, 8. 22. 53 ) even to Krsça. Duryodhana approaches áalya, and tries to convince him to accept the role. It is in this context that the former narrates to the latter the story of Šiva destroying the three cities. Once the Asuras are thoroughly humiliated by the Devas and their leader Täraka is killed. Then bis three sons, TSrakSksa, Kamalãkça and VidyunmSiin perform severe penance and obtain a boon from Brahmfi. They could be killed only if the three cities they planned to inhabit were pierced 1 I am using the following abbreviations : BhP Bhãgavata-purõna, Gorakhpur : Gita Press, 1971.

They build three cities, one made out of gold, the other out of silver, and the third out of* black iron. Târakâksa's son too performs great penance and he too obtains a boon : a pond whose water would bring all Asuras killed in battle back to life. In this way, having become almost invincible, the three Asuras then harrass the Devas. The Devas turn to Brahmä, who after confessing his inability to help them, leads them all to Šiva. The latter agrees to help them and tells to construct a suitable chariot for him. The Devas use not only the world of matter, but also the ancient deities and sacred texts to construct this chariot. With Brahma himself as his charioteer, Šiva goes to fight the three Asuras. When their three cities come together he burns them to ashes with just one arrow. Duryodhana concludes the story by telling Šalya that just as Brahma himself served as charioteer to Šiva, so too he must agree to be Karna's charioteer. S. Bhattacharji suggests that the Tripura episode may be about " an indegenous hero-god credited with destroying rival neighbouring cultures, with skill in the smelting of gold, silver and bronze or iron." 4 But this inter- pretation, I am afraid, " seems to be quite wide of the mark. "5 In those ancient days the movement of an army from one region to another was very difficult. Hence granting that more or less at the same time in antiquity, there were peoples with great differences in culture, they could not be so close to each other, so as to allow a great warrior and his men to get there and attack them. Any attempt to trace the origin of the episode and its meaning must take the text very seriously. As far as my knowledge goes, B. P. Upadhyay has offered the most detailed analysis of the myth in attempting to trace its origin and meaning. His basic thesis is To a great extent the Tripuradahana myth is based on the tradition of Indra-Vftra legend in the Rgveda. A number of symbolism and situations found in the conflict between Indra and Vrtra appear in this myth ... Rudra is sometimes wielder of thunder as Indra ...Agni and Soma, forming the parts of áiva's arrow, shared with Indra the credit of killing Vrtra. Visnu is often allied with Indra in killing Vrtra ... Indra, although the most dominant god in the Rgveda had 4 S.

The onset of the rains &lt;ť marks the start of the new agricultural year. " 7 I shall not bur- den the reader by presenting all the details of Upadhyay's analysis, but I have serious reservations about his basic thesis. It is true that there are quite a few epithets which the Rgveda ( = RV ) applies to Indra and Rudra, but then this is not peculiar only to these two deities. Second, as Upadhyaya himself notes, it is Visnu who accompanies Indra in his war against Vftra. In the MBh, Indra is portrayed as helpless against Vj-tra and so the Devas are advised to approach Visnu ( 5. 10. 1-7). Third, as Bhattacharji remarks, the Tripura episode has " no mythological parallel, except perhaps the faint echo of Vispu's dominating the three re- gions with three steps. "/ Hence it would have been much more understanda- ble if the episode of destroying the three cities was transferred to Visnu. Fourth, if the Maruts are associated with Rudra, they are even more " inti- mate associates of Indra, appearing as his friends and allies in innumerable passages,"9 so much so that "the epithet marutvat, ' accompanied by the Maruts though sometimes applied to other gods, is characteristic of Indra this epithet, as well as marudgana , 'attended by the Marut host', being sufficient to designate him." 10 Fifth, as our author informs us, we find a ritual version of this myth instituted as the seasonal rite in the later Vedic texts, although Rudra-Šiva, PãrvatI, and three demon-brothers, etc. do not have a role in this version. " 11 Is it not strange that the main actors of the story have no role in this ritual version ? Duryodhana's request seems to provide the only link of the Tripura - vadha-upãkhyãna ( = TVU ) with the main story. This acceptance by Brahmä tj be Siva's charioteer, however, not only sounds as an anti-climax to what otherwise is a great cosmic drama, but it is also artificially crea- ted, because it does .not belong to the story as we first have it in the different recensions of the Yajurveda , nor to the other versions found elsewhere in the MBh itself, nor in all the subsequent versions.12 Any attempt to explain 6 Ibid, p. 544. 7 Ibid., p. 541. 8 Bhattacharji, The Indian Theogony , p. 121. 9 A.

Hence I shall first indicate what appear to me to be the main concerns of the present version of the story. Tejas - raši : The Supreme Light Duryodhana begins his narration with the words babhüva prathamo rajan sangramos tarakãmayah ( 8. 24. 3 ). We could translate this either as O king there was the first war caused by Taraka's disease ( tãrkâ-ãmaya )," or as " O king there was the first war involving the stars ( tãrakã-maya.)" I suggest that. the narrative sequence implies the .first, as the next verse speaks of the three sons of Tãraka ( " tãrakasya sutãs tray ah ".), but the se- cond meaning serves better the symbolic character of the story. This will be Clear as we go along. Also the eldest son is Tãrãksa - having eyes like the stars ( tãra-aksã or tãrã-aksã)}0 and the youngest Vidyunmãlin - having lightning for his garland. Tarâksa's son is Hari - and this word could also mean both the sun and the moon.14 Thus from the start we are witnessing a heavenly scene. Later on, when the Devas construct a chariot for Šiva, they also use other items that were of great interest to ancient astrologers : graha9 tãrakã, sürya, candramas, paksa, rãtri , ahan , dhrtüi, medhã, sthiti, sannati, naksatra , sinívãlí , anumati , kuhil , rãkã ( 70-74 ). I suggest that this story has its origin in oné of the most ancient expe- riences of humanity : when the sun rises in the east all the other heavenly bodies lose their splendour and even become invisible to ordinary sight. In fact this is exactly what one version of the Tripura episode suggests : When Siva shot his one arrow many fiery arrows emerged from it, just as streams of rays emerge from the sun, so that the cities were not seen ( BhP 7. 10. 58 ). The sun is the source not only of light ( tejas ), but also of heat ( tapas ), and very soon they realized that tapas is not only the source of light, but also thit it is essential for life on earth The three cities are situated on the earth, in the atmosphere and in the sky. By its rising the sun dispels the darkness on the earth and also in the atmosphere and- in the sky. By its 4 movement * it also marks the rhythm of night and day, winter and summer. The suggestion that we are dealing with a phenomenon involving- bright stellar bodies is also confirmed by the fact that heat ( tapas ) is another 18 The words tara and tara both mean a star. See V. S. Apte, Th e Student* s Sanskrit- English Dictionary , Delhi, Motilal Panarsidass, rep. 1965, p. 233. Some manus- cripts have tãrakãksa and the critical edition has this form in verses 18, 21, etc. Even then we could still translate " having eyes like the stars ( taraka-aksa )." 1« J bid., pp. 635-36.</page><page sequence="5">Anand : Tripuravadha ; The Supremacy of the Yogi 39 prominent feature of the story. The story begins by telling us that the three Asuras performed severe penance ( ugra-tapas ) observing the highest disci- pline ( paramaniyama ) and by their tapas they emaciated themselves ( 5 ). Brahmä is pleased with their dama, tapas and niyama. Maya built the three cities with tapas ( 14). Taraka's grandson too performed severe penance (parama-tapas, 23). Perfected (siddha ) by their great penance (" mahatã tapasã " ) the Asuras have become terrifying for the gods ( 27 ). To secure Šiva*s help, the Devas try to win him over with para-tapas ( 37 ). I am inclined to believe that Šiva himself is the sun. B. Bhattacharya maintains that the Tripura episode " records the synthesis between the tribal, Tamil and Aryan gods and their tenets. "15 1 suggest that the cult of Šiva as sun is pre- Aryan. As the Aryans of the RV times had their own solar deities, they disregarded this charactëristic of Rudra. It has .been suggested that rudra is derived from a now lost root rud, " which must have meant ' to be ruddy or red. ' "lö The blazing sun is red-hot. According to N. C. Kándiah Pillai the Šiva-cult is closely connected with Sun-worship. The sun is red ( sivappu ), and Šiva is the red one.17 Malati J. Shendge, in a recent study, proposes the following hypothesis. Šlva was essentially a solar deity, the sun being considered the supreme creator, destroyer and regulator of the universe. However, later on this aspect of Šiva was completely forgotten and he was treated ãs an independent godhead. The symbols associated with him remained the same but concrete narratives were invented to explain their existence and association with Šiva.18 She also suggests that 'ť His name Kalmalikin, flaming burning and his pre- dominant trait of being fearfully vehement ( tvesa) refer to the ferocious heat."19 Let me give some other indications to show that the solar character- istic of Rudra is also very effectively present in the RV. The description of Rudra's colour makes us think that the sages had some very concrete object in view. He is švityac ( whitish, 2. 33. 8 ). This 11 B.

The word kalmalikin ( 2. 33. 8 ) too is a hapaxlegomenon .</page><page sequence="6">40 Annals BORI, LXXVU (1996 ) expression is used four other times and all for some visible phenomenon or object : Agni ( 10. 46 7 ), Usas ( 1. 123. 9 ), the sage Vasistha ( 7. 33. 1 ) and the members of the tribe of Tftsu ( 7. 83. 8 ). The last two are also described in the texts cited as having braided hair ( kaparda ). Rudra is babhru (reddish brown, 2. 33. 5, 8, 9, 15). This word is used in all twentyfour times : eight times for Soma ( 9. 11.4; 31. 5 ; 32. 2 ; 63. 4, 6 ; 98. 7 ; 107. 19, 20 ), five times for the horse ( 4. 32. 22, 23, 24 ; 7. 44. 3 ; 10. 34. 11 ), twice for herbs ( 1. 140. 6 ; 10. 91. 1 ), twice for dice ( 10. 34. 5, 14), once each for a king ( 8. 22. 10 ) and for a sage ( 5. 30. 14 ). Once the text is not clear, but Sãyana thinks Soma is spoken of (8.29. 1). Thus babhru too is used to describe visible objects. Rudra is also arusa ( red, 1. 114. 5 ). Elsewhere this word is used over seventy times. In most of the cases the object describ- ed is clear.30 In some cases wé need to depend on Sãyana or make our own guess.21 In all these instances also the object described, with just one or two exceptions, is some visible reality. Rudra, alone of all the gods, is adorned with a niska ( a golden orna- ment, 3. 33. 10). The sage had something visible in mind when he said this, because elsewhere we have this word only thrice and in all three instances pointing out to something visible : twice indicating gifts (golden coins? 1. 126. 2 ; 5. 19. 3 ) given to the priest, and once as part of a dream ( 8. 47. 15 ). We have another statement about Rudra " šukrebhih pipiše hiranyaih ** ( Sãyana : Rudra is adorned with golden ornaments. 3. 33. 9 ). Here too the sage is not using some metaphorical terms, but has something very concrete and visible in mind, because the word hiranya is used in the plural in five other places and refers to the rays of the sun ( 1. 122. 2), the ornaments of Maruts ( 5. 60. 4 ), the gifts given to priests ( 7. 90. 6 ), the trappings of a horse ( 1. 162. 16 ) and some vessels ( 4. 32. 19 ). In another text Rudra is bright like ( iva ) the sun, like gold ( hiranya, 1 . 43. 5 ). Let me sum up the data provided by the RV. A visible reality, reddish' in colour - evocative of gold or golden ornaments - inspired the description of Rudra. The sages who composed these hymns beheld a beautiful red orb in the east every ,B Agni (1.36. 9; 3.1.4; 15.3; 29.6; 31.3; 7. 5; 5.1.5; 12.2,6; 6. 3. 6; 8.1; 48. 6 : 49. 2 ; 10. 1. 6 ; 92. 2 ) or its path ( 10. 20. 9 ), Soma ( 9. 8. 6 ; 25. 5 ; 61. 21; 71. 7 ; 72- 1; 74.1; 82.1; 89.3; 111. 1 ), a horse ( 1. 30. 21 ; 4.58.7 ; 5.56.7; 5.59.5; 7.75. 6.; 7. 97. 6), Usas (1. 71. 1 ; 92. 1,2; 4.52.2), smoke (7.3. 3 ; 16. 3; 10. 45. 7). a cow ( 1. 92. 2 ; 6.21.1 ) or its udder ( 1. 146. 2 ), the sun ( 5. 47. 3 ) or its splendour ( 2. 2. 8 ), a bird (1.118.5; 5.73.5), a house (3.31.21) or the parts of a chariot (1.141.8). «l 1.6. 1 ; 14. 12; 72. 10; 85.5; 94.10; 2.10.2: 3 55.11 ; 4.2.3; 15.6; 5.43.12. 56. 6 ; 73. 5 ; 6. 49. 3 ; 7. 16. 2 ; 42. 2 ; 71. l'; 97. 6 ; 8. 34. 17 ; 53. 3 ; 68. 18 ; 69. 16 ; 69. 5 ; 9. 111. 2 ; 10. 5. 5 ; 8. 3 ; 43. 9 ; 89. 9,</page><page sequence="7">Anand : Tripuravadha : The Supremacy of the Yogi 41 morning. It was the golden womb ( hiranya-garbha, 10. 121. 1 ) of all life. The rising sun provides part of the Rudra imagery. This powerful imagery which is also so concrete may have inspired the creation of an icon with similar features - the red Šiva Unga . In one late hymn in the RV ( 10. 136), Rudra shares a mysterious cup with the kešin ( a person having long hair, 7 ). Commenting on this hymn R. N. Dandekar says : A particularly distinctive characteristic of Rudra is his peculiar rela- tion with what appear to have been distinct religious cults in ancient times ... This hymn clearly relates to the specific orgiastic cult of the munis. These munis seem to have worn long hair and indulged in a sort of ecstasy-producing medicament ( X. 136. 7 ). There are also indications that they attained certain miraculous or mystic powers which are comparable to the powers which are believed to be attain- ed through yoga.™ Who is this kešin ? Sãyana, commenting on the first verse, says &lt;ť The hair stands for rays. The wind, fire and sun have rays and so they are kešins ."23 But Säyana realizes that while the flames of fire and the draughts of wind could be compared to rays, here this comparison may not be quite suitable, because the text says if kešyagnim ... bibharti " ( the kešin supports fire, 1 ). So he continues : '« The kešin is the shining sun having many rays which support fire. "24 The sun is seen as the primordial fire. If hair is symbolic of sun-rays, then Rudra too is the sun, for he too is kapardin (having long hair, 1. 114. 5 ). The other earlier texts too were aware of this belief. Savitf is identified with Rudra and Mahãdeva ( AV 13. 4. 4). Rudra has the colour óf the sun ( ãditya-varna, SU 3. 8 ), because he is the sun ( ãditya , SU 4. 2 ), the primordial ball of fire, the source of all creative heat. The TVU informs us that Šiva himself was the very embodiment of splendour ( tejas-raši, 40 ), and his splendour is powerful ( ugra-tejas, 51 ) because he has practised a lot of special tapas ( " tapovišesairbahubhih 39 ). ' In our ordinary experience there appears to be a direct proportion between heat and light, for instance, when a piece of iron becomes extremely hot it becomes incandescent. Šiva lives a vowed life ( vratavat, 40 ; vratin, 48), doing penance not only once in a way but always ( tapo-nitya , 48 ). We 23 Dandekar, Vedic Mythological Tracts , p. 207. 23 kesah kesasthanìya rastnayah tadvantah kesino * gnir vayuh suryas ca» 94 kest rastnibhir yuktah prakasamano va suryah agnini bibharti . 0 [ Annals BORI )</page><page sequence="8">42 Annals BORI , LXXVII ( 1996 ) could even say that tapas is his very nature. Like the sun, the radiance of Šiva is so great that it can nullify the splendour of all the other heavenly bodies even when they all come together {samã gat a, 12) and shine as one (ekibhava, 11). This tradition portraying Šiva as the sun was quite powerful when the Šiva-sahasra-nama ( =SSN ) was composed. It gives us the following names for Šiva : Äditya (65, 137), Bhãnu(30), Ravi (102), Savitr(102, 137). His association with light is emphasized : he is very bright ( atidïpta, 67 ; gabbasti , 131 ; vasti, 137 ) ; nay brightness itself ( tejas, 43 ) ; he is the source of brightness ( tejas-kara, 43 ) ; his brightness is so great or sharp,( ugra-tejas 55 ; maha-tejas 55 ; vasu-šrestha , 118 ; tigma-tejas 133 ) that it can dim that of others ( tejas-apahãrin , 52 ) ; his radiance flows freely without any obstruc- tion (mukta-tejas, J50). Like the sun Šiva tòo is gold itself or has golden features (hema, 62; hema-mãlin , 59; hiranya-kavaca-udbhava, 58; hiranya - bãhu , 1 12 ; suvarna , 82 ) ; through his rays he bestows gold on others ( hema - kar a, 62); his golden rays fecundate the earth ( suvarna-re tas, 39 ). He is also the great ascetic, nây the very embodiment of tapas ( tapas , 113 ; mahä- tapas , 38, 39, 50, 121 ; parama-tapas , 38 ; tapasvin, 33 ; tapas-nidhi, 121 ; tïksna-tapas , 53 ). Šiva is not just the sun, but the very highest lord of the heavenly bodies (grahapatUvara, 37), controlling their movement ( candra - surya-gati , 37 ), and thus making it possible for us to have a calendar of twelve months ( dvadaša, 91 ). He is also the one who with his three steps ( tri-krama, 144) fills the earth, atmosphere and heaven with light. The tradition of Šiva as the sun will live in later inconography : Šiva Natarâja will be enclosed in a circle of fire ( tiruvasi ). In most instances the circle is not complete because the demon or the pedestal on which Šiva dances breaks the circumference. But in some temples we find sculptures on the wall depicting the dancing Šiva within a full circle.2S A full circle with flames : that is what the sun appears to be,26 and for our ancestors the sun was the first experience of fire.*7 Similarly, the third eye of áiva is like the sun ( ãdityasamnibha , MBh 13. 127. 30 ). S. Kramrisch thinks that the Tripura episode " seems to have referred to a special conjunction of the moon and a star ( Pusya ) that coincided with 85 A.

First, the ancient sky-gazers of different lands were fascinated by Sirius, visually the brightest star in heaven. "3i The Egyptians, for instance, based their calendar " on the rising of Sirius ( Sothis ), ť the second sun in the heavens.' "3o They found out that " the heliacal risings of the star occurred at intervals of 365¿ days rather than the 365 days of their calendar year," and so today we have ť&lt; the plan of leap, years." 51 For the ancient Zoroastrians Sirius was the rain god.32 Second, " In Vedic age, the occurrences in the sky were of paramount importance for the timing of the sacrifices."38 B. S. Mukhopadhyaya reminds us that the ancients considered some positions of heavenly bodies as auspicious, while others were believed to be inauspicious. The terrible crisis described in the Tripura story " represents the malignant force that was the outcome of a certain astral position."34 This crisis was so great that even Brahma, Visnu and Šiva could not help but had to wait for the appearance of " The star Pusya [ that ] stood in the same line with the above group and then their devilish force got exhausted. " aa Kramrisch, The Presence of Šiva, p. 417. In his A Dictionary of Sancrit and English ( Calcutta : Educational Printers, 1832, p. 547b ), H. H. Wilson says that the Pusya is " the eighth lunar asterism, comprising three stars, of which one is a Cancer." Indicating the time for the auspicious Pusyãbhiseka-snãna , L. Leger ( •• Festivalsand Fasts (Siamese) in J. Hastings (ed. ), Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics , 13 vols., Edinburgh, T. &amp; T. Clark, 1908-26, vol. 5, p. 889a ) says it takes place " when the moon stands in the asterism Pusya ( nebula in Cancer )." Thus it seems that Pusya is the name both of an asterism of three stars and also of a particular star within that asterism. This asterism is part of the constellation Cancer. For some reason Pusya was regarded in high esteem by Hindu astrologers, and so Ratnamãlã says, " Just as the Lion is the strongest of all quadrupeds, so is Pusya the most powerful among naksa- tras." - Quoted by P. V. Kane ( History of Dh armasãstra , 5 vols., Poona; Bhandar- kar Oriental Rasearch Instituí e, rev. ed., 1968-75, vol. 5, pp. 793-94 ). Sirius is a star in the constellation Canis Major.

Their three cities have three very different locations : earth, atmosphere, and the sky ( bhümi, anta- riksa, dyau, 15 ). Moreover, they could be destroyed only if they were shot through with just one arrow ( eka-isu, 12 ). That would be possible only when they came together, and that would happen only once in a thousand years ( varça-sahasra, 1 1 ). When harrassed by them the Devas approach Brahma for succour and he advises them to appeal to Šiva. Here we have a variant ( 246 ):" Those cities can be pierced only by one arrow ( eka-isu ) and in no other way. Nobody, except áiva, can pierce them with only- one arrow ( eka-isu ). " Thus this text emphasizes the difficulty of the task by twice stating that the Asuras could be killed only with one arrow, and that áiva alone could do that. Šiva, claiming to be the bearer of bow and arrow ( dhanur-bãna-dhara , 64 ), accepts to kill them. Their death could be at the hands only of a highly skilled archer whose arrow could first pierce through one target, and then reach out to the other two, even traversing into outer space ! áiva is that archer ( dhanvin, 45 ) whose aim is infallible ( amogha, 47 ) because he is the best among those who carry weapons ( pravara-ãyudha- dhãrin, 49), and use them in battle ( pravara-ãyudha-yodhin, 47). In the RV there are three hapax legomena - words occurring only once in the whole text- describing Rudra : he is sthiradhanvan ( having a firm bow 7. 46. 1 ), ksipra-isu ( having arrows that move fast, ibid. ) and su-isu ( hav- ing good arrows, 5. 42. 1 1 ). The adjective sudhanvan, having a good bow, occurs only twice : once for Rudra ( 5. 42. 11 ) and once for the Maruts ( 5. 57. 2 ) in a hymn which calls them Rudras ( 1 ) and Rudriyas ( 7 ). Similarly the word tigma-heti occurs only twice : once for Rudra and Soma ( 6. 74. 4 ) and once for Agni ( 4. 4. 4 ). Rudra is also spoken of as tigma-ãyudha ( 6. 74. 4 ; 7. 46, 1 ) - this word occurring again only thrice : once each for Indra ( 2. 30. 3 ), Agni ( 5. 2. 10), and Soma ( 9. 90. 3 ). Rudra dispatches his missile from heaven ( 7. 46. 3 ), and Vãc bends his bow so that the arrow may strike the enemy of the ritual'( brahma-dvis , 10. 126. 6). Thus in the RV Rudra is the great archer. Hence be is worthy to carry a bow and S5 See R. B.

It is only natural that his devotees request him to direct his missiles elsewhere. In another hymn, where the arrows are deified, they are thrice requested by the sage to strike his enemies ( 6. 75. 4, 7, 16 ). If Rudra is accompanied by the Maruts it is simply because he is the primitive hunter apotheosized, and they are his sons and hence they too are hunters- and thereby killers.37 I suggest that the Rudra of the RV is a continuation of the proto-Šiva of thelnuds Valley. On three seals we see a horned human figure seated either, on a stool or on the ground. On the seal he is surrounded by animals and so there are good reasons to think that he is " a prototype of Šiva in his aspect as Pašupati, the Lord of Beasts. #'38 Some aspects of this cult may have their roots in an even older period of human history. The concept of the lord of the animals is not only very ancient but also quite universal. Though it has its origins in the hunting culture - which is " the oldest culture of humanity/'-9 it continues to persist even in pastoral and agricultural societies.40 This deity " often appears as a lord of the forest, mountain or sea " and in c( many cultures the forest ( tree ), the mountain, and the cave are the preferred residence of the animal lord. "4A Sometimes he " is associa- ted with the sun, the moon, a star, or a constellation, "íř - and this may not be without its significance for the story we are trying to understand. He may even provide his devotees with effective weapons. As he also creates the animals we hunt, he may be known as " Father ' or « Mother*. He may appear in a human or an animal form, and in the latter form he "often combines various parts or markings of different type* of animals, thereby emphasizing and enhancing his authority over all game; "43 The theriomorphic form is considered to be older than the anthropo* morphic, and when a particular kind of animal was more frequently hunted then the deity was also represented by that animal, which would even seřve as 37 This suggestion was made by O.

As the protector of the animals " in many conceptions he has the ability to transform himself into many forms and thereby confuse the hunter. "u Some scholars consider the lord of the animals as " an offshoot of the supreme being " or " the supreme being himself. "4S After the hunting culture phase our ancestors moved into the agrarian phase. They have already learnt the art of domesticating animals, who provided not only milk but were also put to «different use, like ploughing the fields. In many ancient agrarian commu- nities the cult and the image of the bull, who was symbolic of the Sky God, was quite common.46 Besides what we have already seen, we have other epithets in the RV that remind us of Rudra's roots in the hunter stage of our history. His aim was considered to be infallible and hence when he struck death was certain. Hence he is said to be upahatnu ( destroying or killing ) - another hapax legomenon ( 2. 33. 11 ), or nr-han (slayer of men) - once again an epithet used directly only for Rudra ( 4. 3. 6 ), and for no other RV deity. He too has many forms (puru-rüpa, 2.33.9). Five times in one hymn Rudra is said to be a bull ( vrçabha, 2. 33. 4, 6, 7, 8, 15 ).- Once he is simply spoken of an as animal ( mrga, 2. 33. II ), and once as a wild boar ( varãha, 1.114.5). Being an archer seems to be an essential characteristic of Rudra. This explains why he is not only invoked with other archers in the l&amp;g-veda but is himself called an archer in the post-RV Vedic texts, and identified with Bhava and Šarva who are themselves armed with arrows.'7 The Taitíiriya-samhitã version of the Tripura episode (6. 2. 3. 1-2) informs us that the Devas were helpless against the Asuras (•' devãh jetum nãSaknuvan " ). Hence they requ- est Rudra to hurl the arrow which they have made out of Agni, Visçu and Soma. They do this because they think he is cruel ( krüra ), and thus is the right person to discharge the arrow. This is a very strange logic. Either the sage who composed this version did not know the real reason or he is not prepared to concede it.43 Thus the true reason why Rudra was chosen was that being the supreme archer he was best fitted for the task. This feature of Rudra remains a powerful motif even in the post-MBh development of this 41 Ibid., p. 23a. 45 Idem. 48 B. A.

Rudra is not even mentioned.</page><page sequence="13">Anand : Tripuravadha : The Supremacy of the Yogi 47 story. It is not easy to destroy the three cities, because their separate and synchronized movements are mysterious ( durlaksya-apãya-samyoga , BhP 7. 10. 53-54 ) and also because they will come together in the afternoon ( madhya-ahan , SPRY 1. 48 ) when the brightness of the sun will make it diffi- cult if not impossible to take an aim at them. Only a very skilled archer could come up to this challenge. The TVU reminds us of the hunter-phase. Rudra carries a weapon ( šUlin, 46 ; šúla-bhrt , 56 ). His eyes are fixed on his prey ( mrga-aksa , 47 ). He is clothed in animal hide ( carma-vãsas, krtti-vãsas , 48 ). Like the hun- ter who camouflages himself, Šiva too has many appearances ( ndnä-rüpa, 41 ). We notice the same trend also in the SSN. He is the protective abode of all the animals ( mrga-ãlaya , 84 ), and he himself may appear in the form of an animal (šrgála-rupa, 44; mrga-rüpa , 45). He adorns himself with the horns of animals ( šrňgin , šrňga-priya 147 ). He is also the hunter carry- ing a bow ( pinãka-dhrk , 72, 133 ) with which he directs his arrows to his pray ( mrga-bãna-arpana , 37 ). To beguile his prey he assumes many forms (bahu-bhüta, 49), endlessly changing his appearance ( ananta-rüpa , 132). Elsewhere in the MBh we also have the charming story of Šiva appearing as a tribal hunter and bestowing on Arjuna the most powerful weapon. Here we are told that Šiva was carrying an illustrious (šrímat, 40.3) bow. Hence more than once he is referred to by a name indicating this feature of his per- sonality : Pinãkin ( 39. 25 ; 40. 31 ; 42. 1, 3 ), Pinãka-p3ni ( 40. 1 ), PinSka- dhfk ( 40. 27 ). As I have shown elsewhere, the narrator has placed these names at significant points of his story. He seems to be eager to convince the audience that it is the bow-carrying tribal who is the centre of the drama.49 We can now understand how the Tripura story seems to have two as- pects : one related to a bright heavenly body, the other to a hunter tradition. Both these aspects may belong to one mythical figure, the supreme being, who is symbolically represented by a bright light in the sky and by a master hunter on the earth. The other possibility is that somewhere in the distant past two traditions originally independent merged together. One was centred around a bright heavenly body, while the other had its roots in the hunter stage of our history. The first community may have had two similar stories, involv- ing two very bright heavenly bodies. In course of time they are merged toge- ther and the lesser light gives way to the greater. In fact Säyana identifies the Tisya with the sun. Commenting on " na y o ucchati tisyah 99 ( RV 5. 54. 49 See S. Anand, " Kirãta-arjuniya : Weapons for World Peaçe ' Journal of Religious Studies, 21 (1992 ), p. 83.</page><page sequence="14">48 Annals BORI , LXXVlI ( 1996 ) 13 ) he writes " tisyah ädityo na yucchati. " Later on this story of the bright heavenly light merges with or absorbs the hunter tradition. This merger may have even been suggested by the fact that Tisya is " an asterism regarded as shaped like an arrow. "50 Tt is also interesting to note that Lubdhaka ( hunter ) is the Sanskrit name for Sirius.51 The sun too is a hunter : on his arrival all the other heavenly bodies disapper, just as the wild animals do when they see a hunter coming. Like the hunter the sun too is at first so harmless. When he gets closer he becomes more ferocious, and then as he leaves once again he becomes less threatening. Just as the rays of the sun appear like long hair, so too they look like arrows. . In fact the MBh says that Šiva, the great be¿T r of arrows by his splendour looks like the sun šulapanirmahan tejasã suryašannibhah," 7 . 173.8). The word tisya comes again only once in the RV, in a hymn addressed to Višvedevas in which Tisya is invoked together with Rudra ( 10. 64. 8 ). Is this merely a coincidence ? Mahãdeva : The Supreme God In the TVU the first time Šiva is thought of, he is referred to by the Asuras as the best of gods ( deva-vara , 12 ). Even with all his weapons Indra was not able ( šakta ) to destroy those cities ( 7. 173. 54 ). Hence all the helpless Devas, with Indra and Brahmä as their leaders, take refuge ( šarana , 36 ) iti Šiva. Together with the rsis, they praise him chanting the sacred Veda ( brahma , 37 ). All creation is pervaded by him and he is the best among those who can take away our fear ( abhaya-krt-tama , 38 ). With nobody like him ( ananya-sadrša , 40 ), he is the one Lord ( " ekam ca bhaga - vantarti 41 ). Since he takes away the pain of those who take refuge in him ( prapanna-ãrti-vinãsa, 49 ), the Devas totally surrender themselves to him with their thoughts, words and deeds ( " manovakkarmabhih prapannan 51). Brahma, who enjoys the status of Prajãpati ( prãjãpatya , 54) due to Šiva, tells him that other than he nobody could contain those Asuras, and he alone is their only match (prati-ari, 55 ), and so pleads fqr his grace ( prasãda9 56 ). They assure him that were he to destroy those cities, then the victims of all the sacrifices will become Raudras ( 7. 173. 55 ), i. e., belong to him. Šiva offers the Devas half his strength so that they themselves could deal with the Asuras, but even that is too much for them as they are not able 60 R. T. H. Griffith, The Hymns of the Rig-Veda, Delhi ; Motilal Banarsidass, rep. 1973, p. 267, in a footnote on RV 5. 54. 13. 51 See Apte, The Student's Sanskrit-English Diçtionary , p. 482.</page><page sequence="15">Anand : Tripuravadha : The Supremacy of the Yogi 49 to bear it, but he can easily accept half of their strength (60-62). It is precisely because he is greater ( abhyadhika, 62 ) and more powerful ( balavat - tara , 63 ) than all the Devas that he becomes Mahãdeva ( 63 ). He is lord of all the Devas ( deva-Ua , 54; deva-Uvara , 66), much greater than all of them ( deva-atideva, 4j ). The Devas construct a chariot for Siva taking the form and material of all the three worlds ( " mürtisarvasvam ãdãya trailoka - sya'' 66). Not only the earth with all its big towns, hills, forests, con- tinents and rivers, but also the sun and the moon, and all the directions are parts of that chariot ( 66-69). áiva's arrow is made up of Agni, Soma and Visnu (84). Thus he is presented as the lord ( i Sana , 35; isa, 42), the master of all creation ( jagat-pati , 42 ). We are also reminded that nobody in this universe is immortal. Tãra- ka's sons ask Brahma the boon that they may never be killed by others ( avadhyatva , 7 ). He tells them that total immunity from death ( sarva - amaraiva , 8 ) does not exist. Even though Taraka's grandson by his severe penance secures a pond that could revive all those killed in war, not only the three cities but also all the demons are eventually burnt to death (121 ). Šiva who is himself the Unborn One ( aja , 42 ) is the death of all ( mrtyu, 46 ). Thus we see that the story is not only affirming the supremacy of Šiva, but is doing this against the background of the Vedic religion. The Tripura episode is " one of the most important achievements of Šiva which made him superior to other gods and his greatness was established in India, "52 and henceforth all the sacrificial victims will be his share. Let me focus on this a little. First, all the Vedic Devas are just helpless. They are so weak that they cannot even bear half the strength of Šiva, but he can bear theirs. Agni, Soma and Vispu - three very important Devas - become parts of his arrow.53 Thus " these deities are reduced in status. "51 In the RV Indra is shown as destroying the fortresses of demons so that " the epithet foit-shatterer " ( pürbhid ) is peculiar to him."55 Similarly purandara{ " Destroyer of Cities")56 was " primarily appropriate to Indra."57 Now even he is helpless. Šiva alone can destroy the cities of the Asuras. Thus he is truly purandara even though 62 Upadhyay, " Reappraisal of the Myth of Tripuradahana p. 539. 53 Earlier it was Indra who was prominent and Visnu was his companion. Gradually the roles are exchanged. See S.

Let us go back a little. When the Aryans entered this great land they encountered a fully de- veloped cult of Rudra. They were thus aware that he was truly an ancient deity. Hence addressing him, the sage of the RV says " irestho devãnãm " ( 1. 43. 5 ) and " šrestho jãtasya rudra šriyasi " ( 2. 33. 3 ) - and both these expressions occur nowhere else in that text. Rudra is the best among the gods, the best by his very birth. The other gods needed Soma to be immor- tal, not so Rudra. He is immortal ( amrta , 1. 114. 6) by his own being, by his own splendour. We have again and again encountered in the RV certain hapax legomena that describe Rudra, and also certain words of expressions used for him exclusively. He is thus in some way a unique god. This may explain why the sage hopes that he may not anger Rudra by faulty praise ( dustuti ) or by invoking him along with some other god/s ( sahziti , 2. 33. 4 ). Other RV gods are comfortable with solfiti : Ágni ( 1. 45. 10 ; 8. 75. 5 ), Agni- Soma ( 1. 93. 9 ), and Indra ( 7. 27 4 ; 10. 89. 16 ). Commenting on 2. 33. 4, Sãya na says " visadršair anyair devaih sahàhvãnena ". Rudra should not be invoked together with other god/s, precisely because he is different from them. If at all there is any hostility towards Rudra it may simply be because he is still a stranger, not yet fully understood and hence not fully incorporated in- to the sacrificial hierarchy of the Aryans. It took a long time for Arjuna and his Aryan ancestors to recognize the Kirãta- a hunting tribal- as Šiva. himself.59 I suggest that the Rudra of RV is a continuation of the fertility-rela- ted proto-Šiva of the Indus Valley and this may partly explain why he appears to have an ambiguous character because " the hieratic Vedic poet-priests of- ten looked at such fertility-gods and their cults with soçie kind of disfavour."00 The remains excavated in that region seem to indicate that those people had some. " preoccupation with fertility." This concern found expression in images that may represent the Mother Goddess, stones that look like the Unga and the yoni, and " the prevalence of the bull (the vehicle of Šiva) or of 58 Later on this word too will be one of the many names of Siva.

On one seal he is surrounded by animals and so ther¿ are good reasons to think that he is " a prototype of Šiva in his aspect as Pašupati, the Lord of Beasts."6S We also have seals that " display the sacred tree enshrining a three-horned deity."04 We notice that, like the animal god described above, this figure too has animal markings and seems to dwell in trees. The Indus Valley people seem to have had the practice of religious processions - a fairly advanced state of religion. Dandekar suggests that " the Principal Indus Valley god, Šiva, was actually represented in two forms - that of the human male with raised phal- lus and that of the detached phallus by itself."65 I am inclined to think that the Indus Valley people had not two but at least three representations of their deity, the original being the image of a bull or some bull-like animal representing fertility,66 a major concern of primal peoples. This animal may have also served as the totem of that community in its earlier history. Concurrently or little later, the bull is also represented by a phallic symbol. The anthropomorphic representation is the last phase of that development, without of course losing sight of the roots in the past. This explains why the figure presumed to be proto-Šiva is surrounded by animals and has a three-horned head or head-dress : the two horns of the bull and the erect phallus. 7 It has also been suggested that the religion of the Indus Valley people was essentially monotheistic.' 8 This monotheistic fertility-related religious thought is indirectly preser- ved in the RV. Though the Maruts are so frequently associated with Indra that marutvat and marudgana are very specially his epithets, it is Rudra alone who is said to be their father ( 1. 114. 6, 9; 2. 33. 1 ) and they are his sons ( 1. 64.12; 85.1; 6.50.4; 66.3, It). In some texts Rudra and Pyšni are named together as their parents ( 5. 52. 16 ; 60. 5 ). Rudra is also identified with the heavenly Asura ( " rudrasya sünavo divo vašantyasurasya 8. 20. 62 Idem . e» Ibid., p. 79. 64 Ibid., p. 84. 65 Dandekar, Vedic Mythological Tracts , pp. 262-63. 66 Even Dandekar ( Ibdi ., p. 268 ) is open to this possibility, because he thinks that " the frequently represented Indus Valley bull may, after all, have been a symbol of the proto-Indian Siva himself." 67 Dandekar ( ibid., p. 267 ) thinks that w those horns assumed the form of the tri'süla or trident." 68 This suggestion was made by the great historian H. Heras. See Dandekar, Vedic Biblio- graphy, vol. I, p. 297.</page><page sequence="18">52 Annals BORI, LXXVIl ( 1996 ) 17).69 On the other hand the Maruts are also said to be " gomãtarah " ( 1. 85. 3 ), having the cow as their mother ( 8. 94. 1 ), and so are " gobandhavah " ( 8. 20. 8 ), relatives of the cow. Rudra is also described as hurling his mis- sile from the sky ( 7. 46. 3 ). Commenting on 2. 34. 2, Sãyana says that Pjrsni is gorupa-dharã and Rudra is vrsa-rüpa. In some ancient cultures the bull was symbolic of the Sky God,70 and M. Mayrhofer suggests that the word rudra is derived from rodas ( heaven ).71 Hence in the RV there seems to be an incompletely articulated myth portraying Rudra as Father Heaven and Pršni as Mother Earth. This is a carryover of the earlier concern for fertility. As Father Heaven, Rudra is the source of all fertility, and so he deserves the hapax legomenon midhvastama ( 1. 43. 1 ), which Sãyarta under- stands as " the best sprinkler " ( sektrtama ). The Aryans had their own conception of the supreme god. They too considered the sun as the most suitable symbol of that god, as its rays fill the whole of creation. The rays of the sun are most visible at sunrise and sunset and so Dandekar concludes : The Vedic poets were so impressed by the sovereignty and magic power of the world Sovereign Varuna, that they created this most profound imagery on the brilliant ráys of the sun at the time of the sunrise and the sunset. The Vedic poets believed that they could see, every morning and every evening, the otherwise invisible and imperceptible world-magician actually in action.72 This may explaian why it took them some time to give Šiva the position of supreme god. But by the time the SSN was composed the supremacy of Šiva was completely beyond question and so it abounds in names indicating it. There is nobody like him ( a-tulya, 61 ), he being the best ( šrestha , 145). He is the great god ( mahã-deva, 99 ), the supreme Brahman ( parama - brahman , 77 ; para-brahman , 149 ), the most holy one ( parama-pavitra , 41 ). He takes away the pride of both Devas and Asuras ( dew-dãnava-darpa - han , 88 ). He is the leader ( agranï, adhyaksa , 142 ) ; lord ( indra , 129 ; ïévarat 143; pati, 116 ); over-lord ( atideva, 143; mahä-i svara, 143; mahã-mãtra , 142); maker ( vinirmãtr , 141); teacher (guru, 141), and refuge ( ãs raya , 69 2. 1. 6 reads " tvam agne rudro asuro maho divah ."

Sthõnu : The Supreme Yogi Maya, who is himself a great demon ( mahã-asura ), and always free from old age ( ajara ), built the three cities (TVU 13). They are made of three metals of different colours : gold, silver and black iron ( kañcana , raupya , kãrsna-ãyasa , 14 ).75 They were guna-prasava-sambadha ( 17 ), " full of the produce of all the Gunas, viz., Sattva, Rajas and Tamas."76 Maya, possessed of all the mysterious powers ( sarva-yoga-vara, 21 ), fulfilled all the desires ( kãma ) of the inhabitants of those cities by his mysterious power ( maya, 22). Overpowered by desire and infatuation ( lobha-moha-abhibhüta ) the Asuras lose all sense of shame ( nirhrlka ), become senseless ( vicetas ) and they vio- late all established norms (28). They wander about as their kãma leads them, conceited ( dar pita ) about the gift they have received. They are wicked people ( dusta-cãrin ) and transgress all bounds of decency ( maryõdã ) and destroy not only the villages and towns but also the sacred abodes of rsi- s, sacrificial posts and the divine forests dear to those dwelling in the heavens (30). All this suggests distortion of life ( viprakãra ) : violation of social justice, disregard for sacred learning, neglect of religious piety and disrespect for ecological hermony. The Asuras are wicked ( durãtman, 33) and have lost all sense of righteousness ( adhãrmika, 34). Brahma informs Šiva that the Asuras have fully transgressed all limits ( atik r anta- maryãda, 55 ), while Šiva. himself admits that they are sinners (papa, 60). The number three is frequently mentioned or suggested : Târaka's three sons, ( 4 ) ; their threefold effort consisting of tapas , dama, niyama ( 6 ) ; their three cities ( 10), situated in three parts of this creation : earth, atmosphere and sky ( 15 ) ; Šiva is also known as Tryambaka ( 44 ) and Tryaksa (49 ) ; the Devas honour him with their thoughts, words and deeds ( 51 ) ; Brahmã -together with the ancestors, sages and gods- addresses Šiva ( 53 ) ; Šiva is greater than all other Devas because he has three halves : two his own and one T3 This sentence is based on compound epithets which have c deva-asura ' as their first part.

When the three cities come to- gether he shoots at them with his arrow which has three points and three fea- thers ( " triparvanã trisalyena ," 7. 173. 57 ). Thus it seems that the story has a symbolic meaning : it is about a crisis of values, and presents the salvific intervention of Šiva as the only way out. Our text also hints at what could be the basis for this belief : Šiva alóne knows both Yoga and Sãnkhya, and he has full possession of himself ( 39 ) - this being a suggestion that he is also the perfect yogi. Hence Bhatta- charya thinks the Tripura épisode is " clearly a legend showing how the Devas had accepted the Šiva-way after having been humiliated... This is an esoteric way of speaking about the final conquest of the Gunas ... "77 According to Sañkhya, there is a primordial principle, Prakjrti which is constituted of three guna-s : sativa, rajas , tamas . Thus the number three has a symbolic function. Before creation these three are in perfect harmony ( sãmya-avasthã ),78 and so their individuality is not manifest ( a-vyakta ). Due to some reason thus harmony is disturbed, and an unbalanced composition of the guna-s results in their becoming visible in different products with their individuality. The Sãmkya-kãrikã (13) states that sattva is prakãsaka (illuminating) while tamas is varanäka ( darkening ).Tü The first demon city is golden ( kañcana ) while the third is of black iron ( kãrsna-ãyasa, TVU 14-15 ), while the second is of silver ( rã jata, MBh 7. Í73. 52). Thus the three cities remind us of sattva , rajas and tamas . Kramrisch believes that ťt The moralized Version [ 12.283.8-17] with the human being, the microcosm, for its playground was implicit in the comsič myth."80 She is thus drawing our attention to the fact that the Sãòkhya Cosmologica! principle is also of anthropological significance. Human beings experience a multiplicity which takes them away from their inner depth. Hence Yoga proposes the cessation of the movements of the mind ( cittavrtti-nirodha , YS 1.2 ), so that the individual can move away from a 77 Bhattacharya, Úaivism and the Phallic World , p. 833. 7á See G.

The YS recommends a bodily posture ( ãsana , 2. 29 ) and defines it as " sthirafn sukham " ( 2. 46 ) : it is comfortable and hence can be steadily maintained. The YS also presents Isvara as the per- fect person and so the ideal yogi because he is free from the contamination of creation (" klešakarmavipakášyair aparãmr stah purusavišesa Isvarah 9'9 2. 24 ). - Due to his sustained practice of very special pcnance ( fct tapovišesair- bahubhih ," TVU 39 ) Šiva knows Yoga and Sãnkhya. He is always a celibate (brahmacãrin, 47 ). He himseif is free from all contamination ( akalmasa , 40), and because he is steady (sthãnu, 35), he can be said to be perpetua- lly seated in ãsana, and for him this is easy because he is already integrated ( eka , 57 ). The Tripura episode presents this doctrine in a picturesque man- ner&gt; with the three guna-s as the three Asuras. As Šiva prepares himself to destroy those three cities he stands like a pillar ( sthänu-hhüta , 7. 173. 56 ) for a thousand years. The narraťor wants to make sure that we remember Šiva as the sthãnu and so he places that epithet in the conclusion of his story (TVU 123). The SSN too highlights the relation of áiva to the Sañkhya-Yoga tradition. He is the original teacher (guru, 129 ), and so responsible for the clarity of Sãnkhya doctrine ( sãnkhya-prasãda , 61 ). He supports the primor- dial energy ( pradhãna-dhrk, , 135 ). He is both the unmanifest and manifest ( vyakta-avyakta , 121, 139). He is the mine of all the guna-s ( guna-ãkara , 47 } that constitute creation, and it is by his impulse that they reveal them- selves fully ( guna-vrddhi , 57 ). The SSN presents áiva as a yogi ( 39 ), well- versed in all the yoga- s ( sarva-yogin, 119 ). He is also the goal of all yoga (yojya, 39). He also has quite a few names that indicate the symbolic presence of three in his mythology : he supports the past, present and future ( tri^kãla-dhrk, tri-daša9 60 ) ; he takes three steps ( tri-krama , 144 .) ; he has three-tiered matted hair ( tri-jata, 46 ) ; he is like the thrice-sweet mantra ( tri-madhu-Mantra , 130) ; 81 he is the lord of the three worlds ( tri-vfstapa , 140 ) ; and he holds a trident ( tri-šanku9 93, 1(0 ). Elsewhere in the MBh Šiva is also known as the bearer of the three- pronged weapon ( tri-süla-päni&gt; 7. 173. 33 ; 14. 8. 25 ). To me this- has a very symbolic meaning : Šiva holds Prakfti both in her avyakta- or sãmya - avasthã - the single handle of the weapon, and in her vyakta-avasthã when the three guna-s reveal themselves - the three prongs of the weapon. The 81 .

The TVU invites each one of us to be a yogi , and thus free ourselves from the dissipation caused by the gnna- s. From where did the MBh get these ideas ? To answer this question we need to read the SU, which I consider as the oldest complete áaiva syn- thesis available to us. Vedãnta : The Supreme Revelation Already in the Satarudriya of the Vãjasaneyí-samhitã ( 16. 1-66) we have the first attempt to bring together the different conceptions about Rudra then popular. This synthesizing concern culminates in the SU.84 The for- mer text is hymnal and the myth and theology of Šiva are indicated indirectly through epithets. The SU, which also belongs to the Yajur-vzda family, contains some liturgical sections, but it is explicitly a theological presentation of an ancient cult and also a practical guide for the seekar. It intends to in- struct us about the highest reality ( para-brahma-upanimd , 1.16), and is clearly a monotheistic text, affirming from the start that there is only one ( eka ) who controls all other causes ( 1. 3 ) and the reference to this one God comes about twenty times.1 5 Rudra is this one, and he is unique, without a second ( " na dvitiyaya 3. 2 ). The Šaiva monotheistic creed becomes very obvious from the fact that not only is Šiva declared to be the only one ( " šiva èva kevalaK 4. 18 ), who existed when there was nothing else, but also from the fact that the word kevala. is not used at all by the other major Upani- shads. 6 This oneOod is alone and free from all the guna- s ( kevala-nirguna 9 6. 11') that constitute this creation. He is, to use a later term, ardha-nârï - i ivara , being both man and woman, youth and maiden ( * tvam stri tvam pumãn asi tvam kumãra uta vã kumãri 4. 3 ). The text also indicates what subsequently will be known as the pañca-krtya of Siva : he creates the uni verse ( 5. 1 ), preserves it ( 3. 1. ; 6. 16 ), leads it to its consummation ( 3. 2 ; 4 82 Apte, The Student's Sanskrit-English Dictionary . p. 241. 83 Manu-smrti , J.

He is also the one source of all the scriptures ( 6. 18 ). He is a saviour god, the friend and refuge of all ( " sarvasya saranam suhrt," 3. 17 ; 6. 18 ).87 Only by knowing him can we be saved ( 4. 14 ), and so the words " jnãtvã devam mucyate sarvapašaih 99 comes as. a refrain ( 2. 15 ; 4- 16;. 5. 13; 6. 13) He upholds righteousness and removes sin ('dharma- vaham pãpanudam, 99 6. 6 ). Besides Rudra, the SU either explicitly gives us quite a few names of Šiva listed in the SSN or suggests them : Deva (1.3 / 141 ),83 Anantarüpa (3.9/ 132 ), Ätman (1.9 / 144 ), Visvarüpa ( 1. 9 / 40 ), Hara (1.10/ 41 ), Nitya (1.12/ 50b ), Giricara ( 3. 4, 6 / 50 ), Devarsi ( 3. 4 / 143 ), Äditya ( 3. 8 I 65 ), Vjrksa ( 3. 9 / 107 ), Prabhu ( 3. 12 / 30 ), Antarhitãtman ( 3. 13 / 35 ), Sahasramõrdhan ( 3. 14 / 129 ), Sahasrãksa ( 3. 14 / 36 ), Sahasrapãd (3. l4 / 128 ), Puràna ( 3. 21 / 104 ), Sarvaga ( 3. 21 / 102 ), Sarvãtman ( 3. 21 / 30 ), Vibhu (3.21/44), Nitya (3.21/50), Agnijvãla (4.2/79), Vãyu (4.2/ 102 ), Candravaktra ( 4. 2 / 103 ), Prajãpati ( 4. 2 / 57 ), TM ila ( 4. 4. / 80 ), Lohitãksa ( 4. 4. / 63 ), Rtu ( 4. 4. / 71 ), Samudra ( 4. 4 / 54 ), Mãyãvin ( 4. 9 / 97 ), Mahešvara ( 4. 10 / 48 ), Varada ( 4. 1 1 / 30 ), Isãna (4. 11 / 72 ), Devã- surapati ( 4. 13 / 116 ), Suksãtman ( 4. 14 / 136 ), Guhya ( 4. 14 / 89), Višva- karman ( 4. 17 / 94 ), Mahãtman (4. 1 7 / 34 ), Aja ( 4. 21 / 45 ), Bhagavãn ( 5. 4 / 32 ), Ravi ( 5. 8 / 102 ), Amrta ( 6. 6 / 121 ), Pradhânadhrk ( 6. 16 / 135 ), Bandhakartr ( 6. 16 / 98 ). Thus the SU is also a thoroughly Šaiva text. The SU monotheism is looted in the past, and hence the text bears witness to the hunter character of Šiva. He is the net-owner ( jãlavat , 3. 1 ), who spread his one net (eka-jãla, 5. 3 ), just like a spider ( tantunãbha , 6. 1 ). He always carries his ( bow and ) arrow ( isu, 6. 6 ) with him. Šiva is not only like the sun ( âditya-varna, 3. 8 ) but. he himself is also the imperishable sun ( avyaya-jyotis , 3.12), and like the sun he illumines all directions (5. 4). Describing the transcendent being of Siva the text says : ťť There the sun, the moon, and the stars do not shine. There the lightning does not shine, much less the ordinary fire. He alone shines and all else shines like him only by his light. " (6. 14 ) Šiva is the primordial light, and so the source of all light, including that of the sun ( " tat savitur varenyam '' ), and hence day and night which depend on this light of the sun are not found in the realm of ¡Siva (4.18). 87 Among the principal Upanishads, it is only in SU that sarana is used in a salvific context. We have this word in Chãndog ya-upanisad, 2. 22. 3-4, but the context is not the same. ° 3 The reference after the oblique is to the Siva-sahasra-nãma . 8 [ Annals [ BORI ]</page><page sequence="24">58 Annals BORI, LXXVII ( 1996 ) Even though the other principal Upanishads use words and expressions and contain som^ ideas that later will become part of Sänkhya Philosophy,39 the SU has not only numerous references to Sänkhya, but it also has some words, expressions and ideas that wé do not find in the other principal Upa- nishads.90 It is only through dhyana-yoga (1,3) and sãnkhya-yoga ( 6. 13 ) that we can come to the One Ultimate Reality that is the cause of all else. This cause is the great God ( mahâ-ïsvara ), who also possesses some myste- rious power ( mãyin ) who by this power ( maya ) makes this universe,91 and this maya is also the primordial matter ( prakrti, 4. 9-10 ).9J God creates this world through the harmonious expression of this power ( sakti-yoga, 4. 1 ). His higher power expresses itself in many ways ( ť; parã ' sya šaktir vividhä 6. 8 ).• 3 He chooses his forms according to his own ť qualities ' ( sva-guna&gt; 5.12). Hence the self-power of God ( deva-atma-šakti) is hidden by its constituents ( svaguna- s, 1. 3 ).• 1 Since he, possesses all the guna- s ( gunin , 6. 2) he is also known as lhe Lord of guna- s ( guna-iša , 6. 16 ). Though the whole of creation is made of three guna- s ( 5. 7 ), Šiva himself is free from them ( nirguna, 6. 11 ). This creation is constituted of things born of primor- dial matter ( pradhãna-ja , 6. 10). The act of creation is described in terms of a cosmic mating in which one male Unborn ( aja) unites with a female Unborn (aya), who is red, white and black in colour (4.5); the colours of the three guna-s. God is also the primal Person ( agrya-purusa, 3. 19), and this universe is his property ( ksetra , 5. 3 ).' 5 Among the major Upanishads it is the SU that most frequently uses the verb yu - from which th¿ word yoga is derived, either in its conjuga- tional form or as a participle.-6 in 2.8-15, it also offers us "a classical 39 See R. E.

It is abo the only major Upanishad that uses the word yoga to describe God's creative work ( 6. 3 ). We thus see that the SU has a very " special treatment of Sãnkhya ana Yoga."03 In the TVU the first name of Šiva we encounter is Devavara- the best god, and Sthãçiu- the immutable one-is the second. This is not by mere chance. In ancient mythology there have been many hunter and solar gods, but Šiva surpassed them all, because very early in the development of his cult, his followers had a deep metaphysical insight : only that One who abides when all come and go ( SU 3, 1 ) is truly the supreme reality. This awareness of the divine irnmu- tablity has another consequence : god is not tempted by his creation. He is the perfect yogi who always has full control over himself ( " yasya cãtmã vase sadã TVU 39 ). This is the reason why he is the supreme god. This expla- ins why Sthira and' Sthãnu- both. indicating divine immutability - are the first two names that we find in the long litany of the names of Šiva (SSN 30). The Sãnkhya Philosophy that we find in this Upanishad is theistic. There is no dualism that we find later on, but Prakfti is subordinated to Purusa.'9 Nay, Šiva is the primal Person {agrya-purusa9 3.19). The text also tells us that Šiva is also the Lord who by his own wisdom sustains the ancient sage Kapila ( 5, 2. ). Šiva himself is the great Seer ( maha-rsi9 3. 4 ; 4. 12 ). We now understand why this is the only principal Upanishad that speaks of the ancient rsi Kapila ( 5. 2 ).100 Tradition has it that Kapila was the founder of Sãnkhya Philosophy, and the author of Sänkhya-sutra.101 Now " When we remember that we have so much of Sãmkhya philosophy in the Švetášvatara, it is not unlikely that in the employment of the term Kapila, the author had, at least indirectly and at the back of his mind, the Sage who was founder of the Sãmkhya philosophy."102 The final emergence of Rudra as the one supreme God is also the emer- gence of the ancient monotheistic tradition of this land, a tradition that pre- 97 S.

The SÜ is the most holy teàching imparted to people who are beyond the four ãs ra ma-s ( " atyašramibhyah paramam pavi- tram..., 6. 21 ), people " who do not belong to any Veda or BrShmaça."10* This may also mean people who lived in this land much before the Vedic soci* al structuies were established. The cult of áiva-Pârvatí appears to be as old as the Indus Valley Civilization, and perhaps even older. If the seated figure, depicted on some seals found in the Indus Valley excavations, is interpreted as yogi,M then those people had, what I may call, the post-agrarian spiri- tual depth. In the hunter-herdsman and cultivator stages, man was concerned primarily with survival here on earth. As a yogi his thoughts go far beyond these concerns. Thus in the Indus Valley we notice certain elements that will appear again as the myth of Šiva grows : a deity who is closely associated with animals, a concern for fertility involving both the male and female prin- ciples, the symbolism of three, monotheism and yoga. The merging of a hunter-god and a tó/wí-producing heavenly deity with the practice of yoga is not arbitrary. The SU describes the practice of dhyãna in terms of a fire-drill ( 1. 14 ), thus suggesting that yoga is the art of producing inner fire ( tapas ) or spiritual fervour. According to the Mundaka- upaniçad the practice of meditation is similar to the art of archery, because the sacred syllable om is said to be the bow, the self is the arrow and God is the target ( 2. 2. 3-4 ). There is one fundamental element common between the art of hunting and the practice of yoga : for both eka-agratã is important. The hunter needs to focus his attention on a single target. The yogi too is engaged in focussing his awareness, and the Yoga- sut ra suggests that he bind his mind to one point ( deša-bandha-citta, 3. 1. ). Thus a cult which began when the ancient hunters were concentrating their attention on some prey now becomes a spiritual discipline through which the aspirant is trying to concen- trate and integrate his awareness. The yogi too is a hunter, and Rudra the best archer is also the best yogi . In its most ancicnt version the Tripura episode, as found in the diffe- rent samhitãs of the Yajur-veda, we find three elements that are found in the TVU : three cities that create a problem for the Devas ; the Devas are helpless; and Šiva alone can destroy them with just one arrow, who then becomes the lord of all. The reason why Šiva alone, that too with just one arrow, can destroy those cities is the fact that he is the supreme yogi. The TVU tells us that Šiva used the pa&amp;upata-astra to destroy the Asuras ( 115 ).

It is " possibly the earliest, and certain- ly one of the most influential, of Hindu religious sects dedicated to the god- áiva."105 It is said to have originated in the middle of the second century of the present era, and later ''competed successfully with the rival Hindu Vaisnavas. ',106 It is the only Šaiva sect spoken of in the MBh.107 The Yajur-veda version of the Tripura story is perhaps the first text documenting its existence. Already here we have the three basic realities which later Šaiva theology will speak about : Šiva is pati, the Asuras and their cities are paša , and the Devas are pašu. The TVU is the dramatic embodiment of this theology. This Saiva religion has come down to us in three basic forms : narra- tive or mythical, systematic or theological, and practical or spiritual. The story of Father Heaven and Mother Earth finds expression in the myth of Rudra and Pyšni, Šiva and Ambikã, and all mortals ( marut- s ) are their off- spring. The theological formulation is contained in theistic Sâûkhya. Šiva and Ambikã are the supreme Purusa and the primordial Prakjti, the one Creator and his creative Energy. In subsequent mythology we encounter the goddess Tripurasundarl - the beautiful dame of the three cities, and this is " another name of Umã or Pãrvati, "108 The practical or spiritual is arti- culated in Yoga Creation involves the emergence of many from the primor- dial One. Our spiritual endeavour consists in freeing ourselves from the multiplicity of our day-to-day experience in order to experience that One. So we can now understand why " Saňkhya is not one of the systems of Indian Philosophy. Saňkhya is the philosophy of India. "109 The SU concludes its teaching by asserting that the highest secret ( parama-guhya ) was put forth in veda-anta ( 6. 22 ). Veda is sacred know- ledge. The word anta can be understood in at least four different ways : last in time, termination, intended goal, best. Though the Šiva religion existed in India before the advent of the Aryans, it took them a long time to see its full significance and to accept it wholeheartedly. Second, once it was accep- 105 D. N.

This is the implicit message of the story of Šiva destroying the sacrificial setup of Daksa ( MBh 12. 274. 18-40). In the TVU, Šiva is described as thè destroyer of Prajäpati's sacri- fice ( prajãpati-makha-ghna , 45). Third, the earlier scriptures were only a preparation for the full revelation of Šiva. All the. four Vedas and also itihãsa-purãna - considered tu be fifth Veda ( Chãndogya-Upanisad, 7. 1. 2) - were parts of Šiva's chariot (TVU 80-81), and the omkãra was placed right in front ( 12 ). The four Vedas also served as the horses for the chariot (103). Fourth, all the earlier Devas and their cults were of no help when there was such a great crisis. Only Šiva, who is the best ( šrestha, SSN 145 ) can come to their aid ( TVU 55 ). All the Devas take refuge ( šarana, TVU 36 ) in Šiva with all their being ( " bhavam sarvãtmanã gatãh, " 36 ). The SU insists that its teaching can be understood only by one who has bhakfi ( 6. 23 ) - another expression found only here among the principal Upa- nisliads,'10 and used "For the first time (vin the sense of devotion, love through faith ) here...111 The highest revelation ( vedãnta ) can only be made to one who has love. Siva-pranidhana : The Supreme Way We have already noted that the relation of TVU to the context in which it is placed is very tenuous. I believe there are two reasons explaining how it found a place in the MBh. It was a very popular story of a very powerful tradition, so that even the Bhrgu Brahmins, who were devotees of Vãsudeva and are responsible for the MBh as we have it today,113 could not ignore it. On the other hand, the message of the story is also thé message of the MBh itself : when we lose our true orientation we become victims of indi- vidualism and consumerism, and this has disastrous consequences in all the major spheres of human life.111 The TVU is the " representation of à spiri- tual phenonenon, i. e. , the destruction of Avidyä and its result Brahma - realization.

I believe this message is important also for us today. The SU informs us that only Šiva is nirguna ( 6. 11 ), totally free from the constituents that go to make and shape creation. He is radical freedom because nothing can cloud his self-consciousness, he being the unchanging light itself (avyaya-jyotis, 3. 12). On the other hand the human being is constituted by the three gunas ( triguna , 5. 7) which are preconscious dispo- sitions inclining him to act in some particular way. Deluded ( muhyamãna ) by their pull, he roams about in this creation and only by experiencing the Lord will become free from all sorrow (vïta-soka, 4.7). The Asuras, who are over-powered by greed and infatuation ( lobha-moha-abhibhüta ) are symbolic of people who are deluded and who have lost their true orientation ( viçetas , TVU 28 ; MBh 12. 283. 10-12). They are not only determined to avenge the death of their father, but also to get great fame ( " mahadaišvar- yam , " TVU 19). They want to become immortal ( avadhyatva, 7 ) in this world. They even devise a way - the life bestowing lake- to revive their dead (25 ). To ensure all this they perform great tapas ( 5, 23), but this is not satya-tapas by which alone can one see the Self within the self ( SU 1. 15 ). It is the arduous discipline which the contemporary world of competi- tion Remands, a world that has the delusion that there is no life beyond itself. Today there is a great loss of our true orientation because the powerful adver- tisement agencies successfully appeal to our instincts and shape our vision of life. The television which claims to give us a view of distant realities ( dura - dar š ana ) in reality often distorts oar vision ( durdaršana ), and this is true also of all the glamorous media products. Maya, the great architect whom the Asuras employ, is the symbol o that individualism which results from delusion. By reminding us of maya , he not only points to the empirical world, but also suggests the temptation that can ensnare all human beings : individualism.. As a suffix, " maya " finds its meaning only in relation to the word to which it is added, in relation to another word which gives it some meaningful place in human discourse. By itself it would not be used in ordinary communication. The three Asura bro- thers prefer to live their lives separately. They choose three cities that will come together only once in a thousand years ! The contemporary world, in spite of all its media, tele-communications, and mega-cities that bring milli- ons of people together, is still a world where there is a great amount of lone- liness, precisely because modern culture emphasizes the success of the indivi- dual at the cost of others. Wiihout our being aware, the superman of Nietzche bas become our ideal. Sometimes this superman-ideal is appropriated by a</page><page sequence="30">64 Annals BORI, LXXVIl ( 1996 ) group, community, but the ideology is basically the same ; " I must be on the top come what may ! " Day by day the number of people who go in for deep depression, break away from their families, indulge in dehumanizing sex, get addicted to alcohol and other drugs, inflict physical violence on others, commit suicide, etc., is on the increase. The cities that Maya built are symbolic of consumerism and the shallowness that necessarily accompanies it. The cities of the Asuras are full of the products of the three guna s (guna-prasava-sambãdha, TVU 17 ), having unthinkable goods and chattels ( avitarkya-pariccheda, BhP 7. )0 54), and all the pleasures ( " sakalan bhogãn SPRY 1. 6 ). Even if something was felt wanting, the inhabitants could get it merely by thinking about it ( " manasã TVU 22 ). Ours is the age of the super-market, where we can get whatever we want, even a different person to sleep with every night, pro- vided we have the money. So we are involved in the rat-race of making as much money as possible, as quickly as possible, by every means possible. There is no place for ethics ( maryädä ). When we arrive at such a state then we are on the road to suicide, as it happened with the other group helped by Maya. This architect is remembered in the Epic for the splendid assembly hall he built for the Pändavas. This hall surpassed even the sun in its splendour ( MBh 2. 3. 21 ), and no palace could match its beauty, because it was match- less ( a-pratima, 24 ). Made by Maya, it had a certain illusory character» and we could say it was mãyã-maya. Duryodhana is deceived four times as he wálks through it, and is laughed at by his enemies ( 2. 43. 1-10). He is deeply hurt by this humiliation and by vulgar display of wealth which that palace s&gt;mbolized. It was to settle this score that he manages to get Yudhis- thira to sit for a game of dice.115 This sets off a series of tragedies, and so I. Karve can rightly say Mayasabha was born in cruelty and had its end in the frenzy of dice.,,u(; The Pändavas did not use it for long, and "its dazzling demonic splendour turned out to be a fleeting dream."117 The Asuras transgress all bounds of decency ( maryãdã) and destroy not only the villages and towns but also the sacred abodes of rsis&gt; sacrificial posts and the divine forests dear to those dwelling in the heavens (TVU 30 ). All this suggests distortion of life (viprakãra) : violation of social justice, 115 It was the crafty Sakuni who advised Duryodhana to invite Yudhisthira for a game of dice because he knew that Yudhisthira loved to play even though he was not good in that game ( 1. 44. 18 ). 116 I.

Our times too witness great social injustice. The poor are becoming poorer. The benefits of development are cornered by a few. Those who control the markets exploit our need and raise the prices of some- times even urgently needed medicines. The world of competitive economy does not care for wisdom, but only for information. We have super-compu- ters that can not only store a lot of data and make it available to us in just a few seconds, but also analyse it and forecast the market trend. We also experience a great distortion of religion. The Asuras went about harrassing others fortified with the grace of BrahmS ( tvat-prasãda-puraskrta , 10). In like manner, many of the big capitalists, who are ruthlessly exploiting the weaker sections of the society and who are involved in such illegal activities like smuggling, go about with the blessings of their religious leaders, priests or teachers. They are using the money they own to the poor or to the govern« ment to build religious shrines. Never before has. our environment been so vandalized as in our times. Our forests are stripped bare, our sea-shores are raped. All kinds of pollutents enter our soil, sources of water, and the at- mosphere. Even the food items we buy are adulterated. The Asuras icon ( ãíu, 19 ) conquered the whole world. They took possession of the i nhabitants of their cities ( " te 'nvavišan prajùh," MBh 12. 283. 9 ). Hence the forces responsible for this global crisis are also within each one of us. Therefore, all of us have to work together to ameliorate the situation. The TVU suggests the pratice of yoga. Nowadays we often hear people say " I am taking a course in yoga." What they are telling us is that they are learning how to do the asanas - different bodily postures. For them yoga is one way of remaining physically fit. But yoga, as taught by the YS, is much more than just the bodily postures. It is a complete approach to live. Before we can begin practising breath control, etc., we need to disci- pline our self through the pañca-yama ( 2. 30 ) - non-violence ( ahimsã ), truth ( satya ), non-stealing ( asteya ), chastity ( brahmacarya ) and non-possession ( aparigraha )- and the pañca-niyama ( 2. 32 ) - purity ( šauca ), content* ment ( saniosa ), penance ( tapas ), the study of Scripture ( svãdhyãya ) and devotion to God ( íšvara-pranidhana ). This is a call to deep religious and moral life. This need not be understood as a call to become a recluse. As a result of proper practice of yoga, the seeker attains to his true self ( sva- rüpa-avasthäna, 1. 3 ). In like manner, when Šiva finally silences the Asuras, the people come to their true nature ( prakrti , TVU 123 ; sva-bhãva, MBh 12. 282. 17 ). Siva's chariot was fitted with artha, kãma, and dharma ( TVU 70 X and what dharma means is clarified a little later where we are told that artha , 9 I Annals [BORII</page><page sequence="32">66 Armais BORI, LXXVII ( 1996 ) karma, satya and tapas are the four reins to control that chariot ( 75 ). This means that the yogi should be involved in the world, that the pursuit of wealth and pleasure is legitimate provided we discipline ourselves. This implies, first of all, a way of looking at life. What really matters is not what we have but what we are ( satya ).118 Second, we are called to a life of discipline ( lapas ) which is not possible without the control of our senses ( indriya-praíyãhãra, YS 2. 29 ). This becomes all the more necessary today when cheap literature, sexy movies, pornographic tabloids and seductive advertisements aré making a concerted effort to destroy our sense of values. Šiva is both : an ascertic and also a householder. This is what true yoga means : to be truly at home in the world and committed to its authentic development, and at the same time be detached and free. This calls for an integrated way of life, and that is what yoga is all about. While describing the practice of yoga, the SU uses the image of riding a chariot ( 2. 9 ). It is also compared to the art of archery ( Mundaka-upanisad, 2.2.3-4). The Devas requested BrahmS to be Siva's charioteer. I suggest that we take Šiva, himself as our charioteer, make áiva-pranidhãna - the contemplative aware- ness of Šiva's presence - as our bow and arrow, and Šiva as our one goal ( yoj'ya , SSN 39). This will maka us authentic yogi-s, and to that extent the world will become free of Asuras. The practice of yoga will bring us to Šiva the supreme yogi, who is life immortal ( amrta. SU 6.6; SSN 121). This was the boon the Asuras wanted to receive from BrahmS. This is also our dream. 1U See Anand. Story as Thtologf, pp. 131-34.</page></plain_text>
