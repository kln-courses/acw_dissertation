<plain_text><page sequence="1">ADVICE TO AUTHORS The American Naturalist is a monthly journal devoted to furthering the objectives of The American Society of Naturalists. It welcomes manuscripts that attempt new theoretical syntheses, especially in combination with new empirical information of broad significance. Brief discussion, criticism, and comment on material published in this journal and elsewhere will be published as "Notes and Comments": all articles will appear with dates of submission and final acceptance. All typewritten material (text, tables, figure legends, literature cited, etc.) should be double-spaced on heavy rag paper of about 200 x 280 mm with a 50-mm margin at the right for editorial notes and corrections. Page one should be a cover sheet including title, names, and addresses of authors. Each table should be typed on a separate sheet. Footnotes to text statements should be avoided because they usually can be included in the text (parenthetically if necessary). Where unavoidable, they should be numbered consecutively and typed on a separate sheet, since they will be set in different type size. Footnotes to tables are often necessary; they should be designated by asterisks, daggers, and similar signs to avoid confusion with numerals in the tables. Table footnotes should be typed on the last page of the table to which they apply. Avoid including material in table titles which can be included in table footnotes. Legends for figures should be typed as a separate section of the manuscript; do not use a separate sheet for each legend. Complex mathematical expressions should be precisely written by hand, or typed, with clear distinctions between such usually ambiguous pairs as "one" and "el," "p- and "rho," "r- and "gamma," etc. For purposes of review, submit three copies of each manuscript, including tables and figures. Authors should retain the original copy of the manuscript and the original illustrations until the article Was been accepted for publication. The original illustrations, or glossy prints, should have authors' names and figure numbers on the back and should be no larger than the manuscript pages. Authors should provide a running head of not more than 44 characters for major articles. Each article, except "Notes and Comments," should contain a brief summary. Material intended for publication should conform to the Council of Biology Editors Style Manual, third edition. This is especially important for the "Literature Cited" section. The abbreviations used in the "Literature Cited" section should conform to those in the Biosis List of Serials. Texts or bibliographies which do not conform to these stylistic requirements will be returned to the authors for correction. Reprints will be supplied if ordered at the time of return of proofs, according to prices quoted on the order form. Fifty reprints of each paper will be provided free of charge. Articles excessive in length or extent of detailed data, but otherwise acceptable to the Editorial Board, may be published as sup- plements when costs can somehow be met. A uniform charge of $20 per page will be made to authors by The American Society of Naturalists. Only after manuscripts have been accepted will authors be asked either to agree to make arrange- ments for payment of the page charges or to state that no funds are available for this purpose, in which case page charges will be waived. After the manuscript has been published, The American Society of Naturalists will bill those authors who have agreed to pay the charges, and payment will be sent directly to the Society. Please note that (1) the same charge per page will be made to each author irrespective of his source of financial support; (2) payment of charges is not a condition for acceptance of a manuscript for publication; (3) if the author can meet only part of the page charges, this will be acceptable; (4) if an author states that he does not have the financial resources to cover charges, the article will be published and the expenses met from other sources.</page><page sequence="2">ANNOUNCEMENT THIRD INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF ECOLOGY The Third International Congress of Ecology will take place in Warsaw, Poland, Sep- tember 5-11, 1982 under the auspices of the International Association for Ecology (IN- TECOL), the Ecology Section, International Union for Biological Sciences (IUBS), and the Polish Academy of Sciences. The major theme of the Congress will be "Ecology as a basis for environmental manage- ment and human welfare." The Congress will consist of six main plenary sessions with related concurrent sessions and special symposia organized by INTECOL working groups. The six main sessions are: 1. Processes integrating ecosystems and landscape, 2. Ad- vancements in the understanding of organismal interactions in ecological systems, 3. Restoration and stabilization of environmental quality, 4. Ecological basis of intensifying biological production, 5. Technological impact of man on the environment, and 6. Utiliza- tion of ecological expertise in resource management and regional planning. Sessions for the following INTECOL working groups are planned: 1. Statistical ecology, 2. Physiological ecology (data transfer from laboratory to field study and vice versa), 3. Urban ecology, 4. Environmental education, 5. Aquatic ecology (wetlands), 6. Granivorous birds, 7. Special symposium on ecology of polar regions. Each session will be organized by Conveners appointed by the Steering Committee. Oral contributions (15 min) selected by the Coveners, posters' presentations, and scientific films will form the main possibilities for active participation. The official Congress Language is English. Registration fees are: participants, $100(U.S.); accompanying persons, $60; stu- dents, $60.

Is language not unique to humans? If so, is mankind's position in nature's hierarchy challenged? Donald R. Griffin attacks these and other questions in his revised and enlarged edition of The Question of An imal Awareness Evolutionary Continuity of Mental Experience Dr. Griffin, a professor at The Rockefeller University and an inter- nationally recognized authority on animal behavior and physiology, renews and expands his attack on the long-held thesis that animals do not have mental experiences. In doing so, he marshals new evi- dence to support the hypothesis that a true science of cognitive etho- logy could be developed if investigators would shed their fears of anthropomorphism. Linguists, ethologists, behaviorists, philosophers, anthropolo- gists, and laymen interested in the world around them will be fascin- ated (and perhaps enraged) by Dr. Griffin's controversial arguments. 220 pp., bibliography, indexes Hardcover: ISBN 87470-035-3 $13.95 plus $3.00 postage and handling ($3.50 foreign) For your copy, write: The Rockefeller University Press Dept.
