<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DIVINE DILEMMA OF ARNOLD J. TOYNBEE By EDWARD WHITING FOX «Y) ECONSIDERATIONS," the twelfth and latest 1-^ volume in Mr. Arnold J. Toynbee's "Study of JLV. History," is such an unusual work that—if its author had not freighted the word with crucial and ominous significance—one would almost inevitably call it "unique." In purpose and form the volume is a review and assimilation of the entire body of scholarly criticism of Mr. Toynbee's "Study" (an accumulation which is now comparable in size, range, and age to the magnum opus itself). In the process of reconsidering his work, however, Mr. Toynbee has achieved vastly more than his announced objective. He has, in fact, transmuted the entire "Study" into a work of the highest importance, quite possibly the most important single piece of historical writing of the twentieth century. He has done this by making clear a great deal that had resisted even the most eager efforts at comprehension, by correcting errors both of commission and omission, by rethinking critical sec tions of the original in the light not only of specific criti cisms but also of new scholarly discoveries, and finally (but by no means least) by doing this with such unassuming ease and charm as to leave the reader almost unaware of the magnitude and significance of this achievement. It was only after I had finished this very long volume that the insurmountable incongruity of calling it "unique" first crossed my mind as an amusing irony. Mr. Toynbee, as we all know, has always regarded the innate human ca pacity for "self-centredness" with the greatest distrust not to say revulsion. In this latest volume particularly he dis cusses this central human weakness regularly in terms of</page><page sequence="2">DIVINE DILEMMA OF A. J. TOYNBEE 105 "uniqueness," or pretensions thereto, virtually creating a basic sin of "uniquity"—although he never actually uses that word. In spite of this, however, the reader gradually begins to realize that Mr. Toynbee has conceived and de veloped his entire work in terms of the capacities and po tentialities of the self-conscious human intellect which, in each individual manifestation, as he concedes, is also ines capably "unique." Since I found it incredible that he would insist on using the same word for two patently unequal con cepts ("the value of the unique individual" and "the indi vidual's pretension to unique value") through a mere acci dent of imprecision, I was driven to the discovery that the inherent ambiguity corresponded to the intrinsic duality of human nature; and that Mr. Toynbee was in fact contend ing, as I then began to realize he had been throughout his Study, with the dilemma of how to protect Man's divine potentialities from his satanic proclivities. It is nothing less than the central dilemma of human experience that has baffled Man through his conscious history, threatens his existence today, and must certainly give pause for conster nation even to the Good Lord Himself! It was, I think, Mr. Toynbee's summary rejection of the Incarnation of Christ (in the last few pages of his annex, "Ad Hominem") that first jarred me into recognition of this ambiguity. Since I am, insofar as I can judge, quite innocent of religious experience and devoid of doctrinaire conviction, my reaction was due to no conscious commitment to the Incarnation but rather to what struck me as Mr. Toynbee's inconsistent and exaggerated reaction to "the implied sug gestion that the divine act of loving self-sacrifice could have happened uniquely at only one time and place." In view of Mr. Toynbee's belief in God (or Reality), it seemed to me that the Incarnation would offer him, as it reputedly did the early Hellenic converts to Christianity, the only avail able alternative to the doctrines of total Immanence or total Transcendence. Since I did not see how he could accept</page><page sequence="3">106 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW either the self-worship implied in Immanence or the self negation of Transcendence, I could not help wondering if— at least as an explanatory "myth" of the sort he so strongly defends—the Incarnation was not all but essential to his structure, and if its rejection, putting in jeopardy the logical conclusions of his entire argument, did not reveal a hidden obsession or dilemma. This discovery, needless to say, sent me back to the beginning to test its validity through the pages of the text. The bulk of the criticism of his "Study," Mr. Toynbee announces in his "Introduction," can be reduced to two charges: first, that in spite of pretensions to an empirical approach, he has forced the facts to fit his a priori systems ; and second, that he has abandoned scholarship for prophecy. To the charge that he has forced the canons of empiricism, he pleads that he was never intentionally or consciously guilty of so doing, but admits that he nevertheless erred in this respect, even if by no means as frequently as some of his critics would maintain. To the charge of prophecy, he wryly responds that the next most awkward thing to saying "I think I am a prophet" is to say "I really don't think I am." The evasion is so graceful that not until much later did it finally dawn on me that the entire volume was not only prophecy (in the higher sense) but that it was an implicit demonstration that all true history is necessarily prophetic. To deal with these indictments, which he continually quotes, paraphrases, and cites in his notes, Mr. Toynbee undertakes in succeeding sections to review his method of work, to reiterate his insistence on the essential subjectivity and relativity of human thought, and to re-examine the effect of these limitations on the study of human affairs in general, and his own "Study of History" in particular, all under three main headings: "Philosophical Considerations," "Re considerations of Structural Problems," and "Reconsidera tions of Particular Topics." The most important source of the widespread failure to understand his work, Mr. Toynbee obviously believes, is the</page><page sequence="4">DIVINE DILEMMA OF A. J. TOYNBEE 107 equally widespread misunderstanding by historians of the true nature of empiricism and its application to their own scholarly discipline. "All study," he begins, in Part I ("Philosophical Considerations"), "is subject to the limita tions of human thought and cannot be safely pursued with out some understanding of those limitations," the first of which is that the mind, by its very nature, cannot help doing violence to reality. By the act of being conscious, our mental image of reality (or paraphrasing Teilhard de Chardin, "Reality's image of itself mirrored in the human mind") is defracted or articulated into subject and object. From this, "we go on articulating or dividing Reality by dichotomies," and then, having cut it up, instinctively try to put it back together by arranging it in classes. Knowledge consists of the similarities or uniformities we find in this latter process; but no matter how carefully we work, there is always some residue or essence which remains incomprehensible because it is unique, that is, because it does not yield to direct com parison with any other phenomena we have encountered. His own efforts to find regularities in human affairs, Mr. Toynbee admits, have been ill received by very distinguished historians; and the reason, he suggests, is that they have been "up in arms in defence of the uniqueness of historical events and human personalities." He himsef clearly doubts the feasibility of studying "unique events" which by defini tion will not yield to comparison or produce meaningful uniformities; but he recognizes that historians tend to shun generalizations with as much fervor as he seeks them. No less than scientists, however, whether they know it or even accept it, he continues, historians are committed by the very act of finishing their sentences to making generalizations. Any statement about the past necessarily relates (in subject and predicate) two or more phenomena thus producing a general proposition. The most common way of thinking about the past, Mr. Toynbee believes, is to apply a hypothetical gen eralization to available data in the hope of finding meaning ful uniformities. Hypotheses themselves, he insists, are the</page><page sequence="5">108 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW product of intuition. When through this process "we are confronted with something that we do not understand, we try to make it intelligible to ourselves by tracing a connec tion between it and something else that we believe we under stand better." One step toward explaining a phenomenon, then, "is to find its context," that is, if it appears to be "unique," to place it in a larger field in the hope of discover ing, among an increased number of phenomena, some that resemble it closely enough to increase our comprehension. After testing the validity of this procedure he finds that, whatever its limitations, it is the only method available to the human mind and must, therefore, be used "insofar as it will work." Since the only measure, as well as the only ob jective, of our quest for knowledge is intellectual satisfac tion, all our conclusions are necessarily subjective; and since demonstration is not available to historians—but only ex planation—their results are, in addition, relative. But to the hazards of relativity (inherent in all scientific inquiries) the student of the science of Man adds the prob lem of bias, since one of the principal human attributes is the knowledge of good and evil and the consequent obliga tion to do one and shun the other. We cannot, Mr. Toynbee asserts, separate the study of human affairs from moral judgments, not even by trying to escape through time, but he cautions us to accept this awesome obligation with utmost care and sympathy. "On the one hand we have always to treat our neighbours' standards and values with the respect and tolerance which we crave for our own . . . and on the other hand, we have sometimes to pass judgment in the name of standards deemed by us, at our peril, to be common to all men.... The price of refraining from them ... would be to break the moral bond of common humanity which is the necessary framework for any relation ... with our fellow human beings." To absolve a fellow human of this moral obligation is to treat him as a child, a doddard, or a lunatic, thus depriving him of his essential human character.</page><page sequence="6">DIVINE DILEMMA OF A. J. TOYNBEE 109 If this knowledge of good and evil, which condemns Man "at his peril" to pass moral judgments on his fellows, is "one of the two faculties that distinguish Man from all other creatures known to him," the other, Mr. Toynbee believes, is "his capacity for feeling that Man himself is not the highest spiritual presence in the universe. . . ." "If Consciousness means what it claims to mean, not everything of worth in the World is traceable to an origin with Man, reference to Man, or application to Man's use," Mr. Toynbee quotes from M. C. Swabey and continues, "the view which makes Man the measure of all things falsifies our attitude in valua tion." This means to Mr. Toynbee that the student of human affairs has not merely involved himself in ethical problems but has "committed himself ... to becoming a theologian, too," because human acts will ultimately have to be measured not only by their effect on other humans but also in their relation to the Higher Presence that human consciousness implies. This, he warns (obviously drawing on experience) is "sheer dynamite" because it inevitably brings into conflict different religious, or anti-religious, convictions. The ap parent solution of this problem by the treatment of religion as an aspect of culture is essentially illusory because scholars will ultimately find themselves involved in passing judgment on the cultures they are examining and therefore on the re ligions too. This suggests to Mr. Toynbee the possibility of completely separating the explosive element of religion from the field of examination, a manoeuvre which leads him to the discovery that the "higher religions," as they devel oped, tended to establish just such an emancipation. Of the first three, however, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, and Hindu ism, none quite made good its escape from the civilization in which it originated; and if the subsequent derivative re ligions or sects, Christianity and Islam, Manichaeism and Mazdakism, and Buddhism and Jainism, have come closer to success, some, at least, have complicated the problem by a paradoxical insistence on their monopoly of truth and sal</page><page sequence="7">110 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW vation with the result that religion still remains an all but insuperable obstacle to scholarly communication within the field of history. To Mr. Toynbee any claim to "unique" or exclusive truth or redemption in the name of a universal faith involves a tragic contradiction. He is, himself, he asserts, anchored by two convictions: first that "the spiritual presence that is higher than Man is merciful and compassionate in its aspect in which it presents itself to us ...," and second, that "every human being is capable of catching a vision of the 'trans human' presence and of entering into communion with it." But he also believes that "there never has been and never will be a chosen people or sangha or church invested with the monopoly of truth and salvation. Any such monopoly would be invidious both for the recipient and donor of the belief. It would not be consonant either with Man's nature or God's nature as [he sees] them." In this first section Mr. Toynbee has not only provided us with his most succinct review of historical epistemology and persuasive recapitulation of the argument for the sub jectivity, relativity, and morality of history; he has also introduced us directly to his dilemma. The very essence of knowledge he finds in Reality's image of Itself mirrored in the human mind but with it an inescapable limit to that knowledge in its inability to grasp the "unique phenome non." Knowledge is possible only through the individual human consciousness; but it can know the individual phe nomenon only through those aspects it finds in common with others. To escape from the historian's dilemma of trying to apprehend the inapprehensible "unique event," Mr. Toyn bee proposes the method of enlarging the context in an effort to find like phenomena in a larger field. Here we can an ticipate his escape from history to metahistory or from the study of national states to civilizations and higher religions. The human attribute of self-consciousness, to him, carries an intimation of Reality which exceeds the powers of reason. But this magnificent universal Reality which he divines—</page><page sequence="8">DIVINE DILEMMA OF A. J. TOYNBEE 111 and the lesser universal truths which he seeks through uni formities in human experience—all are accessible only to the individual human mind. The more he has struggled to es cape the unique phenomenon, the greater has become his dependence on the unique consciousness. In Part II, Mr. Toynbee reviews what he calls structural problems, specifically those produced by the extraordinary increase of the quantity of materials available for the study of human affairs and by the increasingly urgent need for the development of a comprehensive view of the subject. No important discovery, he quotes Einstein as saying, "was ever made in science except by one who lifted his nose above the grindstone of details and ventured on a more compre hensive vision," and he insists this must also apply to history especially and urgently "in a world that has been unified in both time and space." "In order to save mankind," he warns, "we have to learn to live together ... in spite of traditional differences. ... In order to live together . . . successfully, we have to know each other and... each other's past since human life . . . can be observed by human minds only as it presents itself to them on the move through time." The greatest difficulty in organizing the required compre hensive study, he believes, is that it is a relatively new enter prise. His own task, he feels has been that of the pioneer's to "open up the jungle by blazing trails." That in doing this he has had to resort to approximations and has committed exaggerations he feels is inevitable. Some of these he dis cusses with his critics, defending the utility of such methods under the circumstances and accepting advice for improving and correcting the results. The section is a fascinating reve lation of the metahistorian at work: selecting models, com paring them with the available data, considering and recon sidering their applicability, and then discarding some, modifying others, and even under the challenge of un answerable criticism discovering new approaches to old prob lems. For example, he agrees with his critics that he ex aggerated the use of "challenge and response," admitting</page><page sequence="9">112 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW the logical inconsistency implied in the phrase, but he still defends its effectiveness as a "myth." He then considers the "unavoidableness of comparative study by means of models" and proceeds to "a retrial of the Hellenic model for civilization" and the introduction of two new models drawn from Chinese civilization and the Judaic Diaspora. For the aficionados of civilizations this will be one of the key passages of the book; for the world of scholarship it will offer an admirable and all but unprece dented example of the eager and profitable assimilation of criticism. In an effort to make all civilizations fit his Hellenic model Mr. Toynbee has, he agrees, forced his facts to fit the theory, although he does plead that at least one of his more striking errors was due to his dependence on a then respected but now outmoded interpretation of Egyptian his tory. The new Chinese model he finds as useful as the Hel lenic; and the Diaspora, he speculates, might become the "wave of the future" in the modern world because it offers the example of a society living free of the incubus of a territorial base. In this context, he quotes with approval R. Redfield's aphorism that "Civilization is deracination." Part III (which is substantially longer than the first two together) is devoted to a reconsideration of "particular top ics." Beginning with the usage of terms, he considers such fundamental concepts as "definition" and "history," "meta history," "facts," and "laws." While these passages tend to restate a great deal that was implied or even expressed in his epistemological summary, he goes on to introduce important but controversial topics from his "Study," for example, the apparent or alleged contradiction between sci entific law and the freedom of the human will. If most critics have found these concepts irreconcilable, they give Mr. Toynbee little trouble because he refuses to allow any laws, even those of science, to bind the future and insists that their reliability in the past establishes nothing more than the prob ability of their continuing operation in the present and be yond. In human affairs this means, as both M. R. Cohen</page><page sequence="10">DIVINE DILEMMA OF A. J. TOYNBEE 113 and Rabbi Agus have urged, that those who study history and discover the repetitions inherent in its record will, by the act of apprehension, be freed of the necessity of reliving the discovered pattern. Mr. Toynbee then turns to his famous concept of "challenge and response," which has fre quently been condemned as an anthropomorphic image. While he accepts this description of his concept, he justifies its use as a form of myth to describe Man's moral alternative to a materially determined fate. In very much the same man ner he also defends his use of the dichotomy of "man and his environment." Even though he agrees with the geographers that it is logically meaningless, he believes it serves by "mentally dissecting an indivisible Reality" to lay bare "oc casions of [human] freedom [to choose]." To take a crucial example of Man's reaction to his en vironment—and the creation of something new through choice—he turns to the "Transitional Societies," which he now feels he treated too simply in his preceding volumes. If civilization—as he believes—was created from the transi tional societies by a leisured minority, the necessary leisure was made possible by the division of labor, the organization of society, and the development of techniques. Technology is not only the key factor in this process, "it is perhaps the one product of human activity in which there has been con tinuous progress .. . [because if] every technological inven tion must have been made at some particular place at some particular time,... once invented [it] has been apt to spread ... to the ends of the Earth." This discussion leads him in evitably to the argument of "originality versus mimesis," which he reviews in the context of the early civilizations of Egypt, India, China, and the Americas. While he remains cautious about asserting or accepting exclusive claims for either doctrine, it becomes clear that he finds individual acts of invention rare and, in more complicated instances, un likely to occur more than once. Even the exception offered by the independent invention of bronze in the New World serves to emphasize the importance of mimesis by the fact</page><page sequence="11">114 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW that the second inventors put it to none of the same uses as the first, not even weapons! Although he doesn't use the word, this context continually suggests the tremendous debt of the emerging societies to the "unique" creative acts of "unique" individuals. "Man must," he says, "have been im mensely intelligent already before he could dream of invent ing his first tool. This first of his many inventions is, after all, his most brilliant technological achievement for all time. It already contained, in germ, such later feats as the split ting of the atom and the launching of artificial satellites to circle round the Earth and to . . . the Moon. When once Man shaped his first flint. . . !" A technical "Incarnation"? With his reworked definitions and with the new scholarly materials that have appeared since he wrote his preceding volumes, Mr. Toynbee goes on to reconsider specific seg ments of history: the middle American and Andean civiliza tions, for example, and Rome as the universal state of the Hellenic civilization. He then introduces his hypothetical Syriac civilization, which, in spite of its shadowy and inter mittent character, provides him with some of his most radical and useful reconsiderations. Existing for the most part without a political organization or even a fixed territorial base—surely a virtue in Mr. Toynbee's eyes—it produced the first higher religion, Judaism, and—through its collision with Hellenic civilization and their consequent mutual de cay—contributed to the "culture compost" that nourished both Christianity and Islam. The Judaic-Hellenic compro mise in Christianity, however, he obviously considers a be trayal of the spiritual revolution of the Prophets. This brings him back to his passionate preoccupation with the "History and Prospects of the Jews." How, he asks, after having transformed their primitive religion into Juda ism, could they allow this magnificent development to be arrested, leaving its fulfillment to others? The explanation, he believes, lies in their experience of the Diaspora. The Babylonian captivity at once precipitated the prophetic revolution and left the Jews with nothing but their religion</page><page sequence="12">DIVINE DILEMMA OF A. J. TOYNBEE 115 as a vehicle for their common identity as a people. It was the second Romano-Judaic war, however, which finally and totally destroyed the Jewish state, that set the Jews' con scious determination to maintain their common identity through their "Chosenness" and thus caught them in an inescapable contradiction between "national" exclusiveness and religious universality. With full, and one suspects rueful, cognizance of the perils inherent in any attempt to deal clinically—if not ob jectively—with so highly charged a subject, Mr. Toynbee sets out to examine the historical data that are available. It now seems clear that the Yahweh of Israel, Judah, and Edom was a national war god of the type common to Canaan in the thirteenth century B.C. An economic and social revolution—similar to the more famous one that was to occur in Attica—produced serious oppression of the more backward rural segments of the community by the new urban élite. In this crisis, which threatened the very exist ence of the society, the Prophets stepped forward not only to denounce social injustice as an affront to Yahweh but to threaten the impenitent offenders with divine rétribua tion. The concept of retribution seems to have been a new departure which, in conjunction with the impending Baby lonian attack and captivity, was to produce undreamed-of consequences. The unforeseen national disaster not merely fulfilled the Prophets' warnings but did so on such a scale as to trans form Yahweh, Himself. Instead of a defeated tribal war god, he emerged as a Power so superior, even to Babylonia's Asshur, that he could manipulate empires to wreak His vengeance on His sinful children. The first reaction of the stunned victims of this divine wrath was to hope that the same awful Power could restore them to, even elevate them above, their former state once they had proved their re pentance and abject devotion. Gradually, however, they came to recognize the incongruity of attributing such limited concerns to what they were beginning to realize</page><page sequence="13">116 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW must be a universal deity, in fact, the "One True God." "In justifying the ways of Yahweh to Jewry [the Jews] had discovered a spiritual treasure of inestimable value for the whole human race." So inestimable a treasure, Mr. Toynbee is convinced, was bound, sooner or later, "to become the treasure of mankind." For the Jews to constitute themselves the missionary agents of their "One True God," however, would necessitate their merging with their proselytes in a new universal church and forsaking their jealously cherished national identity just at the point at which the true and ultimate source of their "Chosenness" had been revealed. The possibility of their accepting this challenge Mr. Toynbee examines by an alyzing the history and potentialities of the synagogue, the Pharisees, the scriptures, and scriptural interpretation; but in none does he find any promise of escape from the choice between their divinely established national identity and their newly revealed universal mission. At this point Mr. Toynbee drops his rôle of scholar for that of prophet—under a thin veil of speculation—and exhorts his Jewish contemporaries at long last to recognize their chosen destiny to "incorporate gentiles in a Jewish religious community by converting them to the religion of Deutero-Isaiah. . . . The World," he concludes, "has been waiting for this . . . for 2500 years." This anguished plea reiterates, at least by implication, Mr. Toynbee's insistence that the inherent "uniquity" of the Incarnation vitiates the universality of Christianity. But if he cannot accept the Incarnation, neither can he offer any "satisfying" explanation of the Jews' refusal, for two and a half millennia, to accept the full implication of their re ligious revolution. The destruction of the Jewish state in the Romano-Judaic war of 135 A.D. will be hard for some to credit with being a sufficient cause; but if the loss of Palestine did condemn the Jews to perpetual imprisonment in the rôle of a "Chosen People," should we expect the crea tion of the new Israeli state finally to free them for their universal mission? Apparently Mr. Toynbee does not. But</page><page sequence="14">DIVINE DILEMMA OF A. J. TOYNBEE 117 neither does he seem to see that their "Chosenness" is an aspect of the Immanence from which they have never es caped (as the early Christians sought to do through the Incarnation) and which manifests itself in their self-identi fication with the "One True God." Turning next to "The History and Prospects of the West," Mr. Toynbee begins with a reassertion of his belief "that patterns in the course of human affairs are neither pre determined nor inevitable and that therefore past patterns afford no base for predictions about the future." The only thing he is sure he can say about the history of Western civilization to date is that there has been no Western uni versal state. Now with the opening of "the new Atomic Age (in 1949) ... the forcible unification of the Western Society, . . . [has become] impossible because an attempted unification by means of atomic warfare would annihilate the society itself." This leaves the West with the absolute necessity of achieving its universal state by the revolu tionary means of mutual agreement unallayed by force. Man, if he is to survive in this Age, will have to attain to much higher standards of conduct and do so when "the rising gale of scientific discovery has blown away [not only] the chaff [but also the grain] of traditional religion." This, Mr. Toynbee believes, is a disservice, since Man's spiritual en dowment of conscience and will, as well as self-conscious in tellect, "condemns him to a lifelong struggle to reconcile himself with the Universe into which he was born." "The struggle with self-centredness and the quest for harmony with God are issues between a human soul and God; . . . [but] only through a harmonization of human wills, in a compact freely entered into in the light of divine necessity, can peace prevail among men." For those of us who fall into what he believes is the be setting sin of seeing all history as leading to our own moment in it, he hazards—in a discussion of "Russia's Place in History"—the uncomfortably plausible observation that the Communist ideology was in some respects a Christian</page><page sequence="15">118 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW heresy. "In 1961," he continues, the choice between Liberal ism and Communism "seemed to make all the difference in the world." Yet both were expressions and products of Western civilization and "the difference between the Lib eral and Communist way of Western life might be expected to diminish progressively . . . until the . . . feud that was obsessing nearly half the human race might have become no more than an academic issue in the life of an oecumenical society a hundred years later." From this attempt to assess our immediate position he turns to a resurvey of the entire history of civilizations. The resulting summary is so compact as to defy further sum marization and can, I believe, be left for the connoisseurs of civilizations merely with the comment that it records sub stantial changes in the structure and takes Mr. Toynbee on to contemplate the now famous "Next Ledge" looming above our precarious perch. It also leads Mr. Toynbee di rectly back to his dilemma. In earlier volumes of the book, Mr. Toynbee reminds us, he "compared the situation of mankind to a climber's pitch. Below us in full view lies the ledge that our pre human ancestors reached in the act of becoming human; [but] . . . the next ledge above ... is invisible to [us] who are striving to reach it." The ledge below, he continues, "was reached by the acquisition of consciousness and will, . . . two spiritual faculties" that are inherently ambivalent. "Each of us sees the Universe divided between himself and all the rest of it; and each of us seeks to make himself the centre around which all the rest shall revolve." But Man's proper goal, Mr. Toynbee is convinced, is to transcend these intellectual and moral limitations, "to see the Universe as it is in the sight of God, instead of . . . with the distorted vision of one of God's self-centred creatures . . . and to make the self's will coincide with God's will, instead of pursuing self-regarding purposes of its own." Is it con ceivable that the individual consciousness and will can re</page><page sequence="16">DIVINE DILEMMA OF A. J. TOYNBEE 119 spond to this challenge and achieve this goal by its own human action; or are the stakes too high and the risk too great? And if so, should Man's fate be taken out of his own hands, and how? Although moral conduct, Mr. Toynbee believes, should be its own objective, he recognizes that it also serves utili tarian purposes and that with the incredible increase of human power (through human organization almost as much as through scientific invention) these purposes have acquired a desperate urgency of their own. Man, as we all keep re minding ourselves, has achieved the means of destroying himself completely. To avoid this fate, Mr. Toynbee sees two roads open to us: to become righteous (the way of the saints) or to use our power to "condition" ourselves to be incapable of choosing anything but righteous acts (the way of the social insects and the angels!). The possibility of "conditioning" human souls, Mr. Toynbee believes, is as real as that of genocide and has, for many people, the attraction of drugs or intoxicants. It might, he concedes, even save Man from physical self destruction but at the cost of the sacrifice of his essential human characteristic: the ability to think and will. Our prehuman ancestors' victorious revolt against their heredi tary spiritual bondage (which brought them to the ledge below) he compares with Satan's fall! "The freedom of the human self," he summarizes, "is a curse inasmuch as it is the source of spiritual evil . . . but at the same time it is an inestimable treasure inasmuch as it is also the only source ... of spiritual good." "To 'con dition' human beings to righteousness would not only de prive them of these potentialities, it would imply that God had willed the 'conditioner' to effect this deprivation." Here, of course, Mr. Toynbee is attempting to look at his dilemma through God's eyes; and although he obviously discovers no resolution of the problem posed by the capacity for evil inherent in Man's freedom to do good, he nevertheless</page><page sequence="17">120 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW refuses to believe that God would—in mythological lan guage—solve the problem by depriving Man of his human quality and reducing him to the status of an angel. If we do not resort to the desperate expedient of self conditioning, Mr. Toynbee sees only one other alternative to self-destruction open to us : the way of sainthood. And if he recognizes its all but impossible difficulty, he also urges its inescapable necessity. The saints, he reminds us, do not lose their human character because they do not achieve per fection. They seek it, and it is in this quest that our only hope of salvation lies. For him, as Albert Hourani has al ready pointed out, "civilization is equated with progress toward sainthood." And finally concluding on a note of very cautious hope, Mr. Toynbee suggests that we have recently acquired two valuable insights to start us on our way: the knowledge that we can no longer afford to be our brothers' murderers and the dawning recognition that we can for the first time afford to be their keeper. At the outset of his "Reconsiderations," Mr. Toynbee argued that no matter how thoroughly we analyzed any phenomenon there would always remain some unyielding residue; and so after the completion of his self-appointed task, he finds himself contemplating that "unique" aspect of reality: himself. The personal factor in all intellectual endeavor (at least outside the demonstrable sciences), he acknowledges, has been widely recognized ; but he goes on rue fully to admit that his earlier efforts to aid his critics to dis count his own biases were ill received. The biases, they seemed to find, were obvious; and the necessary deductions they felt quite able to make for themselves. Even so, re viewers have continued to introduce personal considerations to such an extent that he felt bound to make some response; but to avoid repeating his previous offence, he confined himself to answering specific charges and has relegated his answers to an annex, "Ad Hominem." The reader will rapidly discern, however, that this annex is no appendage</page><page sequence="18">DIVINE DILEMMA OF A. J. TOYNBEE 121 but the real conclusion of the book. His "Study of History," Mr. Toynbee twice quotes from Hourani, is "his education," and we can read these latest conclusions only in their im pact on his consciousness. Mr. Toynbee begins his review of his critics' comments ad hominem with "the effects of a classical education." After reminding his readers that "classical education" is neither a Western nor a modern development but a phenomenon common to many civilizations, he considers first its fortunate and then its unfortunate effects. It is the nature of classical education to introduce the student to a preceding culture and language and as a result to inculcate a sense "of piety toward the past." He is grateful for this effect of his own education and for the "note of learning through suffering and . . . the awe-inspiring spectacle of the sinner's fateful progress from success to pride to catastrophe," which he finds to be the central characteristic of Greek and Latin literature as well as so important a feature of the Old and New Testaments. "One of the chief obstacles to our treating each other tolerantly," he reflects, "is the illusion . . . [so] hard to overcome that our own particular relative values and standards are universal and absolute." One aid to cor recting this illusion, he believes, is to live vicariously in another culture; and, as a result of his own experience of this exercise, he has acquired deep misgivings concerning the standards of our own Western civilization, so deep, he admits, as to expose him to repeated charges of ambivalence or downright perversity. Even where he acknowledges the justice of the charge, he remains intractably impenitent. It was, he confesses, this revulsion against the self centredness of modern national history that drove him flee ing through the reaches of time back to the dawn of civili zation itself. My own first reaction to this revelation was that the ground covered grotesquely exceeded the size of the object he was avoiding until I began to realize that it was only from such distance and with the total view it</page><page sequence="19">122 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW would provide that we could possibly hope to get our per spective straight, and be able—to offer one important ex ample—to see Communism in its true proportions as a Christian heresy! Turning from questions of his training to examine his inner motivation, he suggests that his driving passion has been "reverence toward virtues outside ourselves," above all, "self-sacrifice for the sake of love." Such reverence, he rec ognizes, is a moral obligation for all men; but he obviously finds irreverence a more usual requirement of moral exist ence because he is convinced that "Man's besetting sin [is] self-centredness." He acknowledges, "without misgiving or apology that [he tilts] against pretensions to uniqueness wherever [he] encounters them," and particularly when they involve a group or an institution with which he is as sociated. He rejects, for example, "the pretensions to be a 'chosen people' in whatever peoples' name it is made. The Jews, 'the British Israelites,' the British 'sahibs,' the Hindu Brahmins in India, the Japanese, [his] fellow Balliol men in Oxford, [his] fellow Teutons, the German Nazis, all seem [to him] to have been chosen by no one except them selves." And further, he rejects "the pretensions of Chris tianity to be a unique revelation of the truth about Reality and a unique means of grace and salvation." As Mr. Toynbee develops this discussion which is patently central to an understanding of his work, he directs his re marks almost exclusively to the "self-centredness" of groups, not individuals. Although he does not comment on this fact, it seems fairly safe to assume that it reflects neither lack of awareness of, nor special indulgence toward, the proclivity of single individuals to the same vice. Whether it represents mere recognition of the greater danger to others of the collective "self-centredness" of groups or whether he senses that the vice itself is magnified by com mon participation, he does not say. Perhaps the explanation behind Mr. Toynbee's tacit distinction lies in the fact that</page><page sequence="20">DIVINE DILEMMA OF A. J. TOYNBEE 123 serious self-worship by a single individual is likely to be viewed and treated as lunacy. But since our usual standard of sanity is the ordinary conduct of most people, the lunacy of mass self-worship is much harder to convict in the court of public opinion or in the hearts of misguided men. It is, in any case, a distinction which I believe can contribute to our understanding of Mr. Toynbee's dilemma. Mr. Toynbee next felt called upon to mention his habit ual tendency to "lean over backward" and in one graphic passage he hopes that if he is guilty of the scholar's halluci nation that his own work is "unique" he will "lean over backward in revulsion [from himself] till [his] head touches [his] heels." As a moral exercise this is an athletic accomplishment which I think readers of the present volume would agree was most impressive; but at the same time, I cannot help wondering if a stance in which the ears are unflinchingly held between the ankles does in fact provide a superior view of life. I realize that Mr. Toynbee would claim no more than that it was different and therefore of fered the advantage of comparison and thereby the possi bility of correction. But through these last passages, I cannot help "catching a note" of unrestrained self-revul sion which, although not fully spelled out in his text, has certainly been audible to me and, to judge by published criticism, to many of his other readers. It is this tendency, it has been pointed out and Mr. Toyn bee admits, that has betrayed him into his most controversial comments on Zionism. His confession that he would, if he could join any religion, become a Jew suggests that his passion is that of a disappointed lover. Closer scrutiny, however, reveals instead that his violence derives from his horror of himself as a "Jew," who but by the grace of Re ality might have gone there. Once the suggestion has been made, it is quite obvious that so gentle a man as Mr. Toyn bee could have been so unrestrained toward no one but himself or some group with which he identified himself.</page><page sequence="21">124 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW But even here, after long and careful reconsideration, he almost completely reaffirms all that he has said about the Jews and Zionism. "The spectacle of any Jew," he insists, "following in the Nazis' footsteps is enough to drive a sen sitive . . . spectator almost to despair. Of all the people in the world the Jews have had the longest and harshest ex perience of what it means to be victims of injustice and cruelty." That they should inflict on others some of the wrongs they have suffered, "is a portent that makes one wonder whether there may not be something irremediably evil, not in Jewish human nature in particular . . . but in the human nature common to all men." Here for the first time, it seems to me, Mr. Toynbee is in escapably cornered by his divine dilemma. Having rejected Christianity not merely because of its "pretensions to uniqueness" but specifically because of its categoric affirma tion that the divine act of "loving self-sacrifice" was accom plished at one time and place uniquely, and having sought to find true universality of reverence toward Reality in the Jewish revelation of Deutero-Isaiah, he has now been con fronted with the spectacle of the heirs of that tradition be having in a way "to rob any sensitive man of whatever remaining shreds of faith [he had] in human nature." Only with a deep pervading and unshakable faith in human nature can any man or God (who wishes Man well) have the courage to watch him in his headlong wilful course and not be overwhelmed by the need to curb his freedom for his own salvation and "condition" him to right eousness. The despair Mr. Toynbee has experienced, as a result of the behavior of the Zionists, has obviously driven him to doubt Man's capacity to master his own satanic pro clivity and realize his divine potentiality through the free exercise of his own individual will and consciousness. He has been, that is, driven to a critical distrust of human nature and a corresponding urge to curb its freedom. At this point I believe public tribute should be paid to</page><page sequence="22">DIVINE DILEMMA OF A. J. TOYNBEE 125 Mr. Toynbee's unflinching integrity and courage in an alyzing and denouncing Zionism for what it is. Conscien tious Gentiles have, quite understandably, a tendency to become morally paralyzed in the presence of Jewish sur vivors of Nazi terror (as many Jews seem to feel themselves to be) by a helpless sense of vicarious complicity in, and guilt for, their persecution. If this sentiment gives evidence of a generosity of spirit, it also inhibits thought. In recogniz ing special responsibility to the Jews—because of our share in humanity's guilt for the Nazi persecution—we recognize their special status within humanity, that is, a "Chosenness." Such a monstrous fate inflicted on a Chosen People, however, is a matter between them and Him who, having chosen them, has now chastised them. Gentiles can hardly share responsibility for this. But as the Babylonian captivity revealed, through the Prophets, a God capable of wielding empires as his tools cannot be conceived of as the property or partner or even parent of only one segment of humanity. Before such a universal Power, we all, Jews and Gentiles alike, share in both the suffering and guilt occa sioned by the Nazi crimes. In all fairness, however, it is necessary to acknowledge, as Mr. Toynbee does, that the Jews to their undying credit have always been the harshest critics of their own crimes. And Mr. Toynbee himself, it would appear, has spoken as a "Jew" (emotionally) in self revulsion. He then goes on to plead with all Jews to aban don their "Chosenness" and open to all their treasure of salvation: the vision of all men as the equal creatures of a single just and loving God. In abandoning Christianity (because of its commitment to the "unique" act of Incarnation) and seeking the uni versality he craves in the teaching and tradition of Deutero Isaiah (which the Jews have preserved for themselves alone) he was acting, I suspect, not merely in self-revulsion. Having confounded "self-centredness" with "self-conscious^ ness," he may have tried to escape from his dilemma by</page><page sequence="23">126 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW sacrificing "self" in both aspects in some voluntary act of "conditioning" or mergence in a universal faith. This may explain his admiring, almost envious, glances at Buddhism and its salvation in Nirvana; but in a Western context the deliberate subjection of "self" does not necessarily, if ever, remove the menace of "centredness." In fact, we have al ready remarked that the only examples of "self-centredness" Mr. Toynbee discusses are collective; and I began to won der why he had not suspected the possibility of some in herent connection between the loss of "self" in groups and the generation of collective "self-centredness." To follow, as Mr. Toynbee does, this jeremiad against "pretensions to uniqueness" with a clinical consideration of the prosaic subject of "institutions" seemed at once an anti climax and a non sequitur until I realized that he was indeed undertaking to analyze one important mechanism of collec tive self-centredness. Sir Ernest Barker, he begins, has taken him to task for referring to political institutions as "slums," a word which he still finds fits his meaning reasonably well but which he offers to replace with "public utilities" if it will please Sir Ernest better. Even academic committees, Mr. Toynbee shrewdly observes, are capable of perpetrating, col lectively, absurdities and cruelties which would be quite be yond the conscious capacities of the committee members as individuals. Moreover, he continues, "when votaries of an institution proclaim that it is something 'unique' and that it must be idolized accordingly, they are serving warning that they have converted a public utility into a public nuisance." Returning directly to his central theme, Mr. Toynbee as serts that human pride—the naked expression of self-cen tredness—"culminates in the assumption that Man is the highest spiritual reality that exists." Nor is "irreverence in the face of Hybris" merely his own personal idiosyncrasy but one of the central themes both of Hellenic poetry and the Hebrew scriptures. Hybris, moreover, is not peculiar to human beings but "is the besetting sin of everything that has</page><page sequence="24">DIVINE DILEMMA OF A. J. TOYNBEE 127 life in it and a living god is not made immune ... by his di vinity." When created by "Man in Man's own likeness, He may thunder over Israel from Sinai, or browbeat J ob from the whirlwind ... or lower gloomily ... over a prostrate human race." If (rod confronts him in such an odious epiphany, Man's proper reaction is irreverence and "defiance his proper retort. ... It would have become Job better if ... he had replied in kind like Ajax!" He would no doubt, "have for feited his consolation prizes and perhaps his life, as well, but he would have saved his human dignity." This is indeed a stunning climax to a truly epic flight from the individual in search of the universal. The paradox of Mr. Toynbee alone defying a malevolent Divinity in de fense of the dignity of a "unique" human individual will certainly strike most readers as unexpected. He has, it is true, paid repeated and generous tribute to the creative and benevolent capacities of Man. With Teilhard de Chardin, he recognizes the reflection of Reality, Itself, in the human consciousness, just as he recognizes Man's capacity for moral acts, including the ultimate one of "self-sacrifice for love," in the freedom of the human will. And if a malevolent Re ality had flung Man on a predetermined course toward a flaming finish, Mr. Toynbee would take his stand with Ajax. Here it would seem he was contending with the other alter native to the Incarnation, that is, Transcendence. "Malevo lent Reality," may be no more than a personification of wholly Transcendent Power; and Man's "predetermined course," only his own irrelevant insignificance in the Vast Scheme of Things. Mr. Toynbee believes, however, that Reality is benevolent and that Man must be free. It is through the exercise of his virtues and capacities that Man has created civilizations, caught some glimpses of Reality in Its many manifestations and even on occasion experienced It directly. Yet all of this Mr. Toynbee sees threatened by the marriage of Man's new and apparently unlimited power (over everything but</page><page sequence="25">128 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW possibly his own will) and his proclivity to self-centredness. Although he does not ask, as does Salvador de Madariaga in the "Blowing up of the Parthenon," if all our accumulated store of beauty, knowledge, and the very potentiality of civilized existence can in conscience be entrusted to as dan gerous a custodian as Man himself, he does—as any thinking man must today—draw back before this awful question. It is perhaps odd that Mr. Toynbee—who has acknowl edged and defended his repeated use of the dialectic—did not formulate his dilemma in dialectic terms. His thesis that the individual human consciousness is capable of apprehend ing Reality and acting freely in response to Its challenge is balanced by the antithesis that the same unique conscious ness has an all but irresistible tendency to see itself as the climax and focal point of all experience. The necessary syn thesis of this paradox, it would seem to me, must involve the consciously willed subjection of human "centredness" but not—as Mr. Toynbee seems to imply—the deliberate nega tion of "self" and the consequent abdication of consciousness and will. He does not, it is true, offer this conclusion in these ex plicit terms, but I find its echo in passage after passage of passionate irreverence toward all the "pretensions to unique ness" which he attacks. And while I accept his assessment of the dangers of "self-centredness," I find this implied solution disturbingly negative in character. In fact, I wonder if the "mergence" of self is not really a form of self-inflicted "conditioning." This negation of the individual, it would seem, is also a negation of the will, and men without will are, Mr. Toynbee himself has warned, no more than angels —or perhaps a "Chosen People"? It is this paradox, I suspect, that Mr. Toynbee has drama tized in his preoccupation with the Jews and their failure to give their treasure to all mankind. In anguish he pleads with them to do it now while there is still time, and I wonder if they can. The question, however, is not one of determinism, racial or otherwise, but of definition. In the act of giving</page><page sequence="26">DIVINE DILEMMA OF A. J. TOYNBEE 129 their treasure to the world they would, as Mr. Toynbee says, automatically sacrifice their "Chosenness," and this, it seems to me, they cannot do as Jews but only as individual human beings. That it was thus once uniquely done, according to the myth of the Incarnation, was, I begin to suspect, to reveal the inescapably individual nature of salvation. In canvassing the possibilities of public and physical sal vation, Mr. Toynbee has already warned against exaggerated reliance on institutions. "Conditioning," on the other hand, he seems to view as a possibly practical, if repulsive, alter native. The Communist societies have, to some conscious extent, attempted to practice it on themselves; and most liberals see imposed "conditioning" as the price of succumb ing to Communist domination. But the possibility of "self conditioning," Mr. Toynbee notes, will have, under some circumstances, the attraction of drugs. "Is it not time," an American senator recently asked, "that we stop allowing the Russians a monopoly of the advantages of a [police state] ?" He was, of course, addressing himself directly to the "advantages" of being able to practice secret and decep tive diplomacy, but indirectly he was expressing the growing fear of freedom in internal, as well as international, politics which threatens to assume the proportions of panic at any minute. But even if we should try to save ourselves physically by the sacrifice of our humanity through the act of becoming social insects, I am by no means certain that we could suc ceed. It might just prove impractical for Man either to sup press or surrender his own freedom permanently. I must confess to considerable skepticism about the claims now made for existing forms of "conditioning." Advertisers, obviously, are much more interested in selling advertising than corn flakes (which sell themselves in any case) and to this end have created an enormously profitable but by no means veri fied myth of their own fiendish power. Under close inspec tion, "brainwashing" revealed itself to be much more a mat ter of filling empty, than emptying full, minds. And the</page><page sequence="27">130 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW new "self-conditioned" societies behind the iron curtain have not yet succeeded in matching the impersonal efficiency of the ants. "Conditioning" as it is usually envisaged is a com plex and subtle science which would require intelligence and purpose to carry out. Moreover, the projected "conditioned societies" of our prophets of doom are highly organized and would also require a great deal of scientific and technical talent to maintain. Whether the would-be "conditioners" will be able to educate individuals to the sophistication necessary to run a "conditioned society" (and incidentally to be "con ditioners" too) and at the same time "condition" them totally, thus creating a self-perpetuating insect society, seems very doubtful indeed. If this is true, Man's effective choice lies between moral salvation and physical destruction; and moral salvation, Mr. Toynbee seems to be insisting, will be achieved only through individual acts of love and sacrifice made possible by individ ual understanding, however fragmentary, of the nature of Man and Reality. Progress toward the "Next Ledge" can be—as the entire adventure of civilization has been—con tinued "progress toward sainthood." But isn't that, he seems to ask, a counsel of utter despair and wouldn't it be safer to escape the deadly incubus of "centredness" by the abjura tion of self? I am not inclined to think so. In the first place we have the record of past achievements, which however mod est on the moral plane (compared with the scientific) cannot safely be ignored. These feeble forces of righteousness that strike us as so hopelessly unequal to the coming struggle have, after all, proved their superiority in the past at least by the necessary margin. Civilization has been wrought by an endless series of individual acts of creation and "self-sacrifice for love." It is this fact we have recognized implicitly in honoring the memory of our scientists, artists, soldiers, and martyrs, but which we now perversely tend to deny in our desperate fear. Perhaps the thing that frightens us most about the new world we entered in 1949 is that we instinctively realize we</page><page sequence="28">DIVINE DILEMMA OF A. J. TOYNBEE 131 can no longer defend civilization by war, even though our abhorrence of the inhumanity of war prevents our acknowl edging the real nature of our fear. Mr. Toynbee himself grudgingly admits that war has played an important, quite possibly a necessary, part in the creation of society; but even he seems to miss, or perhaps reject, the essential point that war has repeatedly provided the occasion for individual acts of "loving self-sacrifice." Those who despair of our future may therefore be saying in effect that men—capable of sacri ficing themselves and each other in war—will not be able to rise to the level of sainthood and, when necessary, sacrifice themselves as martyrs. Undeniably, this has been achieved by few in the past, and there might well seem to be no reason to expect that many would suddenly discover the moral re sources necessary to rise to this challenge. It should be re membered, however, that men have seldom made the tre mendous effort required for the creation of something new except under the stimulus of dire necessity. Never before have Man and his civilization depended on the substitution of martyrdom for war. But civilization, Mr. Toynbee says, has always depended on Man's progress to ward sainthood ; and sainthood is not a condition but a striv ing toward the right response to the challenge of Reality. If I have understood him, Mr. Toynbee believes that it is just barely possible Man may respond to the challenge of the Atomic Age by undertaking sainthood. With this I agree. But unlike Mr. Toynbee—if I have correctly sensed the nature of his dilemma—I am convinced that Man can do this only by a conscious exercise of will in the inescapably "unique" act of salvation and not through a loss of self. Fi nally, I share Mr. Toynbee's belief that to do this Man will have to enlarge his understanding of his own consciousness, the Reality it mirrors, the implications of his past, and the lessons it offers for the future. He must, in short, reconsider himself and his past with the modesty, candor, curiosity, wis dom, and loving sympathy manifested in this book.</page></plain_text>
