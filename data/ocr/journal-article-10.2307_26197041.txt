Laszlo Department of Meteorology, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland (Manuscript received 18 March 1991, in final form 15 July 1991) ABSTRACT Concern about possible effects of a steady increase in C02 on the earth's climate, and the fact that current estimates of sources and sinks of C02 do not balance, generated interest to improve knowledge of rates at which carbon is cycled between the oceans, land, and atmosphere. The net primary productivity (NPP)—namely, the rate at which inorganic carbon is transformed into organic matter—is strongly controlled by the availability and intensity of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR); the distribution of photoactive pigments; the efficiency with which the light is absorbed; and the efficiency of its conversion into organic matter. In this study the feasibility to derive one of the above parameters is demonstrated—namely, PAR on a global scale. In the past, information on PAR was obtained from local ground measurements in the 0.4-0.7-^m spectral interval. In the absence of such measurements, PAR was estimated from measured total solar irradiance, using empirical "con version factors." It is demonstrated that this important biogeophysical parameter can now be derived from satellite observations. The inference model is implemented with global satellite data that are available from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) to produce for the first time global fields of PAR and corresponding "conversion factors." 1. Introduction Oceanic and terrestrial biological processes control the transfer of carbon among the atmosphere, oceans, and biosphere. Net primary productivity (NPP), that is, the amount of daily net carbon fixation, is at present not well known (National Academy of Sciences 1986). Changes in the carbon cycle have been well docu mented (DOE 1985); the atmospheric C02 has been steadily increasing at a rate of 1.8 ppmv yr"1, yet the anthropomorphic sources do not balance the oceanic and terrestrial sinks (Bolin 1977; Woodwell et al. 1983). The relative effects of oceans as compared to those of terrestrial ecosystems are not well understood. Estimates of the contribution of the oceans to the total global photosynthesis range between 10% and 50% (Perry 1986). It has been believed that the oceans are the major sinks of CO2. Based on recent model sim ulations and inventories of in situ oceanic observations of C02 absorption, it has been speculated that possibly land, rather than the oceans, is the largest sink of C02 (Tans et al. 1990). Better information on carbon sink and source distribution is required to understand the global carbon cycle. Many factors play important roles in controlling the exchange of carbon between the at mosphere, the oceans, and the terrestrial biosphere. The key ones are: the amount and distribution (horizontal and vertical) of phytoplankton in the oceans, the Corresponding author address: Rachel T. Pinker, Department of Meteorology, University of Maryland, 2213 Computer and Space Science Building, College Park, MD 20742. © 1992 American Meteorological Society amount and distribution of vegetation over land, and the distribution and characteristics of PAR (e.g., in tensity; diurnal and seasonal variation). Information on global distribution of the first two parameters is becoming available from remotely sensed observations (Esaias et al. 1986; Ohring et al. 1989). Large-scale information on photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) or even on incoming solar radiation (SW|) is as yet not available. The relationship between climate and biological activity is complex. While the abundance of phytoplankton depends on the intensity of incident radiation and the supply of essential nutrients (e.g., nitrogen), a higher abundance of phytoplankton in creases absorption of radiation and thus enhances the rate of heating at the ocean surface (Sathyendranath et al. 1991). They calculate a maximum rate of bio logical heating for the Arabian Sea as 4°C mo"1, which is an important contribution to the net heat flux. In the absence of direct information on the required ra diative fluxes, they assume climatological values of SW| and that 50% of the SW| incident on the ocean surface would be absorbed in the top 1 m of the water column. Information on PAR, SW|, and their direct and diffuse spectral components would allow one to improve modeling of light absorption in the ocean and the CO2 budget on a global scale. In this paper we will demonstrate that it is now pos sible to derive PAR from satellite observations. Sections 2 and 3 will briefly explain why information on PAR can enhance the prospects for obtaining better estimates of NPP in the oceans and over the land; the method ology to derive PAR and the sources of satellite data</page><page sequence="2">January 1992 PINKER AND LASZLO 57 that make global determination feasible will be pre sented in section 4; results will be discussed in section 5; and a summary will be given in section 6. 2. Current approach for estimating NPP in oceans To estimate accurately NPP in oceans, one has to have information on light availability and intensity, distribution of the photoactive pigments, efficiency of light absorption by the pigments, and efficiency of con verting the absorbed light into organic matter. In ad dition to factors that affect photosynthesis directly (e.g., irradiance), it is affected indirectly by such factors as sea surface temperature, wind speed, and surface roughness, which influence mixing and advection (Parslow and Harris 1990). A comprehensive review of the various methods to assess primary productivity in the oceans can be found in Jahnke ( 1990 ). Of major interest are optical methods, the use of which is growing rapidly (Dickey 1988). For instance, Piatt ( 1986) pro poses the following relationship between photosyn thesis and light: P(z) Pm(z)B(z){I{z)/Ik(z)} [1 + {/(z)//*(z)}2]1/2 (1) where P(z) is primary production at depth z (mg C m-3 h_1); I(z) is PAR (E nT2 h~') where E = Ein stein unit; B(z) is Chlorophyll a concentration (mg m~3) at depth z (the primary light-absorbing pig ment); Pm(z) is the assimilation number [mg C(mg Chi a)-1 h-1]; and Ik is the adaptation parameter ( E m-2 h "1 ). Of primary interest is the depth-integrated primary production, ^(mgCm^d"1), which is de termined by the vertical profile of the phytoplankton and the assimilation number. Because of the low bio mass concentration, estimates of photosynthetic rates are based on the measurement of rates of incorporation of 14C-labeled isotopes in incubation. The amount of living plant carbon in the ocean is small (0.5 - 5.0 g C irT2 ) ; the turnover time is of the order of few days and is controlled by light and nutrients (Harris 1980, 1984; Epply et al. 1985). Because of the fast turnover time of the biomass, photosynthetic rates can also change rapidly. Ability to assess the spatial variation of chlorophyll would be very important. The coastal-zone color scanner (CZCS) (Sturm 1983) on Nimbus-7 was designated to provide information on the concentration of chloro phyll pigments. The observations are in four visible bands centered at 0.443, 0.520, 0.550, and 0.670 ^m; one broad NIR band; and one IR band. The surface resolution is 0.8 km. The blue-green reflectance ratio is used to estimate the concentration of the phyto plankton pigments. 3. Current approach for estimating NPP over land Growing attention is being given to the cycling of C02 between the atmosphere and vegetation and to methods for estimating net primary productivity over large land areas. Running ( 1990) recognizes two basic approaches for estimating NPP of natural vegetation, which are now discussed. a. Use of the normalized difference vegetation index Presence of vegetation and its seasonal changes can be detected from satellite observations (Tarpley et al. 1984; Tucker et al. 1985). Chlorophyll pigments in leaves absorb solar radiation in the visible part of the spectrum and strongly reflect and backscatter radiation in the NIR. A combination of radiances in these two spectral intervals was found to be useful for estimating vegetation amounts. The Advanced Very High Reso lution Radiometer (AVHRR) on the NOAA polar orbiting satellites observes the earth in visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) channels (0.55-0.68 jum; 0.73-1.10 ßm). This allows one to assess differences in vegetation behavior on a global scale. The most fre quently used parameter is known as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) defined as NDVI = VIS - NIR VIS + NIR (2) which ranges from &lt;0.02 for deserts to &gt;0.5 for fully developed vegetation canopies. Based on a linear re lationship found to exist between seasonal variations of the NDVI and seasonal variation of atmospheric C02 (Tucker et al. 1986), attempts have been made to use the NDVI to quantify the rate of atmospheric depletion of C02 due to photosynthetic activity of the biosphere. However, the translation of the NDVI into biological information is not without pitfalls. As dis cussed in Running and Nemani ( 1988), it is the leaf area index (LAI) (the projected leaf area per unit ground area) and not the NDVI that provides a mea sure of vegetation in the C02 exchange. It is possible for different biomes to have different NDVI but iden tical LAIs. An NDVI of 0.5 can represent an LAI of 3 in a forest but an LAI of 2 over grass (Sellers 1985, 1987). Therefore, it is claimed (Running 1990) that in order to properly utilize the NDVI, it is necessary to know the biome type to do the correct conversion between NDVI, or LAI, and the absorbed PAR (APAR). A simple model that relates NPP to APAR was proposed by Monteith ( 1971 ): NPP =/( 2 APAR)*€, (3) where t is the energy conversion efficiency in grams per Megajoule and SAPAR is the seasonally integrated APAR: t incorporates such factors as the amount of incoming solar radiation, LAI, and canopy radiation absorption characteristics, which directly affect the photosynthetic production of plants. A limitation of this formulation is due to the assumptions that the vegetation is not water, temperature, or nutrient lim ited, which is not the case for natural, perennial veg</page><page sequence="3">58 JOURNAL OF CLIMATE Volume 5 etation. Therefore, Asrar et al. (1985) suggested to modify Eq. ( 3 ) as follows: n M= 2 SC, (4) /'=1 where M is the total dry phytomass, n the number of days, ec the photochemical efficiency factor, e, the frac tion of absorbed PAR, is the fraction of energy in the PAR, S the total incident solar radiation (J m~2 d"1 ), and C is the crop stress index, which can include the effects of water and temperature (Daughtry et al. 1983). b. Ecosystem process models Several limitations of the NDVI to estimate NPP have been recognized. Of particular concern is the in sensitivity of this index to evergreen vegetation. This prompted the development of an alternate approach to estimate NPP by using physical models of ecosystems in which the LAI is one of the remotely sensed inputs. It is being claimed that characterization of vegetation in terms of LAI, rather than species composition, is a valid simplification in comparing different ecosystems. It is based on findings during the International Bio logical Program (IBP) conducted in the 1970s when a strong correlation was found between biome types re lating LAI to NPP, as reported in Gholz ( 1982), Dick inson (1987), and Goward ( 1989). The NDVI and the LAI have been found to be highly correlated (Spanner et al. 1987). Therefore, the NDVI, as estimated remotely, enters into the process models indirectly. An example to this approach is the FOR EST-BGC model proposed by Running and Coughlan ( 1988). It allows calculation of the cycling of carbon, water, and nitrogen in a forest from a relatively small number of observed parameters. This approach is pro posed for "calibration" of NDVI models and not for global-scale implementation. Until now, PAR has been estimated from total sur face irradiance that, in turn, is estimated from clima tology or "bulk formulas" that incorporate information on cloud climatology. Information on the global dis tribution of PAR would enhance the prospects of get ting better estimates of NPP. Moreover, the importance of accounting for the diurnal and spectral variation of the incoming radiation has been recognized (Harris 1978; Sathyendranath et al. 1989). The inference model that we have developed would allow account ability for such variations. 4. The methodology to compute PAR a. The inference model The approach used to derive PAR is based on a physical model for deriving surface solar irradiance from satellite observations (Pinker and Ewing 1985; Pinker and Laszlo 1992), using detailed radiative transfer computations in five spectral intervals. The broadband (0.2-4.0 #tm) flux transmissivity, T [ratio of the irradiance at the surface to that at the top of the atmosphere (TOA)], is related to the broadband TOA reflectivity, R (ratio of the reflected flux at TOA to the TOA irradiance). Once the relationship T = f(R) is known, T and the surface irradiance, SWj, can be computed by determining R from the satellite-mea sured narrowband radiance. The model can be imple mented with climatologies or actual measurements of atmospheric and surface properties; it allows one to account for the particular spectral response of each sat ellite sensor, and it also allows for computation of the total surface irradiance, its spectral distribution, and its partitioning into direct and diffuse components of irradiance. Three major steps are involved in the implementa tion of the model. In the first step relationships, T -f(R), i = I,.. .N, representing V-different, realistic atmosphere-surface conditions are established through radiative transfer computations of transmitted and re flected fluxes. Each of the N different conditions is characterized by a specific surface albedo, given amounts of absorbing gases (ozone, water vapor), and scattering constituents. The reflected and transmitted fluxes are computed for a plane-parallel, vertically in homogeneous, scattering and absorbing atmosphere in five spectral intervals (0.2-0.4, 0.4-0.5, 0.5-0.6, 0.6 0.7, 0.7-4.0 um) using the delta-Eddington approxi mation of the radiative transfer (Joseph et al. 1976). The rationale for the selection of the delta-Eddington approach and the accuracy of this method are discussed in Pinker and Ewing ( 1985). The atmospheric radia tion model accounts for 1 ) absorption by ozone and water vapor; 2) multiple scattering by molecules; 3) multiple scattering and absorption by aerosols and cloud droplets; and 4) multiple reflection between the atmosphere and the surface. It has five or six layers depending on the aerosol profile considered and on whether clouds are present (Fig. 1 ). Amounts of pre cipitable water derived from the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) and ozone amounts are available from the ISCCP CI tapes used (section 4b). The vertical distribution of aerosols is described by the appropriate profile of the Standard Radiation Atmo sphere (WCP-55 1983). For example, over land we used the CONT-I models, namely, continental aerosols in the planetary boundary layer, tropospheric aerosols up to 12 km, background stratospheric aerosols up to 30 km, and upper atmospheric aerosols above. The average optical depth of these layers at 0.55 um was 0.2, 0.025, 0.005, 0.00012, respectively. Over oceans the MAR-I model was used. Clouds were assumed to be between the levels of 2 and 5.5 km. The surface albedo models from Briegleb et al. (1986), scaled to albedo values as derived from the clear sky composite of the ISCCP CI data, were used. In the second step, a TOA albedo, Rsat, directly comparable to albedos</page><page sequence="4">January 1992 PINKER AND LASZLO 59 DOWN UP LAYER I • I v &gt; LL / W 0 obsorption 77/mF Fig. 1. The model atmosphere adopted in the PAR inference model. R obtained in the first step, is determined from the satellite measurement. In the third step, the relationship T = fs(R), pertaining to the atmosphere-surface con dition, s, that existed when the satellite measurement was taken, is selected from the results of the first step, and an estimate of T(and SW|) is obtained. T=fs(R) is determined from auxiliary information on the amount of gaseous absorbers and surface reflection and by matching the satellite-derived broadband albedo, Rsat, to albedos computed in the first step (R ). Since the radiative transfer computations are performed spectrally in intervals that include the region (0.4-0.7 /im), it is possible to obtain an estimate of PAR directly. In view of the important role SRB plays in most of the World Climate Research Programs (WCRP), the WCRP/International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) is sponsoring Intercomparison of Radiation Codes in Climate Models (ICRCCM) (Luther et al. 1988). The integrity of the radiative transfer compo nent of our solar model has been tested in the ICRCCM framework. The results have been found to be in good agreement with high-resolution radiative transfer models (Fouquart et al. 1991). The complete model as implemented with satellite observations is being tested in the framework of satellite Algorithm Inter comparison under the sponsorship of WCRP, the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) (Whitlock et al. 1990). Preliminary results have indicated that the SW| can be estimated within the WCRP accuracy requirements, namely, to within ±10 W m~2. Ground truth on PAR is at present not readily available. b. Global satellite datasets Under the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP), several formats of uniform global satellite-measured radiances from an international net work of operational weather satellites in the visible and thermal IR are available. The international network includes five geostationary satellites: Goes-E and Goes W (United States); Meteosat (European Community); GMS (Japan); INSAT (India); and at least one polar orbiting satellite (Schiffer and Rossow 1983, 1985; Rossow and Garder 1984). Each geostationary satellite has imaging times of approximately half an hour and can scan about one-third of the globe; the polar-orbiting satellites observe the globe twice a day. While many of the operational satellites can observe the earth at high spatial resolution, due to limited storage capacity on the satellites only sampled data are collected. Of par ticular interest are the datasets known as ISCCP B3 and ISCCP CI. They are produced at the Global Pro cessing Center (GPC), NASA/GISS. The spatial res olution of the raw images of the ISCCP data ranges between 1 and 4 km in the visible and between 4 and 12 km in the IR. The primary global-radiance-data product B3 has a nominal spatial resolution of ap proximately 30 km and a time resolution of 3 h ( for observations from the geostationary satellites). Two types of B3 datasets are available: 1 ) from geostationary satellites and 2 ) from polar-orbiting satellites. For each day, measurements taken at 0, 3, 6, 9, 15, 17, 18, and 21 UTC are included in the B3 geostationary data. The position of the data points in space is changing with time. The ISCCP CI data are derived by combining the analysis of the B3 data (both geostationary and polar-orbiter observations) to obtain a complete global coverage every 3 h. The nominal resolution of the map grid is 250 km; each map cell represents an area equal to that of a 2.5° X 2.5° latitude-longitude cell at the equator (Rossow and Garder 1984). For each map cell, 132 quantities are reported. These include visible radiances for an average clear and cloudy pixel; total number of pixels in the C1 cell; number of cloudy pix els; identification of snow/ice; viewing geometry; sat ellite identification; and also derived cloud parameters. The number of available observations at each grid cell is not the same. In areas that are not covered by geo stationary satellites (at the time the ISCCP CI data were processed, data from the Indian geostationary satellite were not available), only data from the polar orbiting satellite are available. In such regions, the ac curacy of the retrieved daily values will be affected. The ISCCP data are useful for deriving quantities that depend on clouds, such as global solar irradiance reaching the ground. In the present study we used the ISCCP C1 data to produce PAR. Specifically, the visible radiance for an average clear and cloudy pixel for each C1 cell is used to derive a broadband planetary albedo, which is then matched to the model-generated albedo to infer the surface PAR, as detailed in section 4a. Information on the total number of pixels and the number of cloudy pixels is also provided.

Results Most of the available information on PAR comes from measurements made at selected agricultural sites during the growing season. Usually, both PAR and the total shortwave radiation are measured and "conver sion factors," CF, defined as PAR/SW|, are derived; these are later used to estimate PAR empirically from independent SW| measurements. Because the spectral distributions of direct and diffuse radiation differ and change with the solar zenith angle, some investigators suggest that separate conversion factors for the direct (CFdir) and the diffuse (CFdif) components of the solar radiation be derived as a function of solar zenith angle. We used the radiative transfer component of the Pinker and Laszlo ( 1991 ) solar model to simulate the effects of various atmospheric constituents on the CFs and the complete model, implemented with the ISCCP CI data, to compute PAR and CF for July 1983 on a global scale. a. Simulations In all the simulations performed, the surface albedo was assumed to be zero. The effects of the following parameters have been evaluated. 1) Solar zenith angle A clear atmosphere with aerosol optical depth of 0.23 at 0.5 fjm and a cloudy atmosphere with cloud optical depth of 10 was assumed; ozone was kept con stant at 0.3 atm-cm and water vapor at 3.5 gem"2. When the cosine of the solar zenith angle changes from 1 to 0.2, the CF changes only slightly from 0.45 to 0.42 for the clear case and from 0.53 to 0.48 for the cloudy case (Fig. 2a). 2) Ozone A clear sky with a CONT-I type aerosol was assumed. The aerosol optical depth was 0.23 at 0.5 um and the sun was overhead. Water vapor was kept constant at 3.5 g cm"2. The CFs changed from 0.45 to 0.44 with ozone amounts ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 atm-cm (Fig. 2b). 3) Aerosols A clear sky and two aerosol models, MAR-I and CONT-I, were assumed. Ozone amount and water va por were kept constant at 0.3 atm-cm and 3.5 g cm-2, respectively; the sun was overhead. For optical depth in the range of 0 to 1.15, the CFs for the MAR-I aerosol changed between 0.45 to 0.447; for the CONT-I aero sol they changed between 0.45 to 0.42, respectively (Fig. 2c). 4) Water vapor A clear sky and a CONT-I aerosol model with optical depth of 0.23 at 0.5 /um was assumed; the sun was overhead. For water vapor in the range of 0.5 to 4.5 g cm"2, the CF changed from 0.416 to 0.451 (Fig. 2d, right scale). A reverse effect on the CF by increasing aerosol optical depth is also illustrated (Fig. 2d, left scale). 5) Clouds A CONT-I aerosol model with optical depth of 0.23 at 0.5 Mm was assumed. Ozone was kept at 0.3 atm cm and water vapor at 3.5 g cm"2. The sun was once overhead and once at solar zenith angle of 78.5°; the CFs changed from 0.45 to 0.66 and from 0.42 to 0.43, respectively, when cloud optical depth changed from 0.05 to 80 (Fig. 2e). As evident, increase in certain atmospheric constit uents will tend to increase the CF (e.g., water vapor), while an increase in others will tend to decrease it (e.g., aerosols). What is observed under actual conditions represents the result of these compensating effects, which might act to reduce the range of the CF as derived in the simulations. b. Implementation of the inference model The ISCCP CI visible radiances for July 1983 were used to derive the monthly mean global distribution of PAR, and the conversion factors, CF (Figs. 3-4). The spatial distribution of the July PAR is similar to that of the July surface solar irradiance ( Pinker 1990 ) with maxima over North Africa, the Mediterranean, the central Atlantic and Pacific oceans, the Arabian Peninsula, and the western United States. Low values can be found over the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), which during July is situated around 10°N; over monsoon-dominated India; and over southeast China. The "conversion factor" (CF) shows strong spatial variability, indicating that CFs obtained from few local measurements should not be extrapolated for global applications. The higher values are generally as sociated with cloudy regions, while the lower values are either predominantly clear or cloudy with low angle of illumination (solar zenith angle larger than 60°). These features have a physical basis. As the sun moves towards the horizon, more radiation is reflected ( scat tered) back to space and less reaches the surface. The scattering is more effective in the PAR spectral band than at longer wavelengths. Therefore, the relative contribution of the radiation in the PAR band to the total radiation will decrease with increasing solar zenith angle. Ozone absorption will affect only PAR; an in crease in ozone amount will have a similar effect as an</page><page sequence="6">January 1992 PINKER AND LASZLO 61 o o 0£ 1 U.

Because clouds are almost non absorbing in the visible and strongly absorbing in the 0.7-4.0-jum interval, an increase in cloud amount will increase the CF. This is well evident around the cloudy equator, where the CF are high. An increase in aerosols will have an opposite effect than an increase in cloud iness. The CF will decrease with increasing aerosol op tical depth because of the aerosol absorption in the visible. This explains the relatively low CF over North Africa as compared to those over the oceans; maritime aerosols absorb less energy than continental aerosols. Limited "ground truth" on conversion factors was available from a comprehensive field experiment con ducted during 1 July 1980 to 30 June 1981 at the Water Management Research Laboratory, California State University, Fresno (36°40'N; 119°30'W), 104-m ele vation (MSL); about 20 km northeast of Fresno and at the University of California, West Side Field Station (36°20'N; 120°20'W), 87-m elevation and about 80 km southwest of the center of Fresno ( Howell et al. 1983). For the West Side Field Station for July 1980, a value of0.448 was observed for the CF. For the Fresno station a value of 0.458 is reported for the same time period. Our results for July 1983 over this region yield a CF of 0.45. Howell et al. ( 1983) did not observe a seasonal trend in the CFs at these two sites. Zonally averaged values of PAR were also computed using latitudinal belts of 2.5°, the size of the basic ISCCP C1 cell; the standard deviations of the monthly mean of each 2.5° X 2.5° cell from the latitudinally averaged mean were also computed (Fig. 5). As evi dent, the maximum values can be found around 30°N; there are local minima around 10°N, 55°N, and 75°N, which correspond to increased cloudiness at these lat W/m! Fig. 6.

Results of the type presented in Fig. 5 will allow identification of geographical regions with PAR values below or above "photosynthetic saturation point" for different crops. Characterization of the photosynthetic climate during the growing season is of interest for planting practices and modeling of NPP. The variability in this parameter will enable regional crop modelers to estimate error limits in the predicted yields. Frequency distributions and selected statistics for PAR and CF were also derived ( Fig. 6 ). The frequency distribution of PAR resembles a normal distribution with a higher number of cases of lower irradiance. The mean and median values are within 2 W rrf2 and the maximum reaches 164 W m 2. The frequency distri bution of the conversion factors, CF, is presented in Fig. 7. Most cases can be found between 0.44 and 0.50, the mean and median being 0.46, while the minimum and maximum are 0.39 and 0.53, respectively. The statistical information presented in Fig. 6 can provide modelers of NPP with nominal inputs to test their models' sensitivity to natural variability in these pa rameters. Conversion factors in the range of 0.44 to 0.69 have been reported; their dependence on cloudiness has been recognized (McCree 1972). In the absence of obser vations, it was recommended to use 0.5 as an average value for CF (Ross 1975). Various attempts to apply such an approach are reviewed in Howell et al. ( 1983 ). However, photosynthetic rates depend on the flux den sity of PAR (Gates 1980) and the daily intercepted PAR (I PAR) is a function of the spectral quality of PAR, in particular, for small values of LAI ( Hipps et al. 1983). Therefore, the use of a constant conversion factor could lead to errors in NPP estimates. Fig. 3. (Top) Global distribution of monthly mean PAR for July 1983, as derived from the ISCCP CI data.

Frequency distribution of monthly mean conversion factors (CF X 100) for July 1983, as presented in Fig. 4, and relevant statistics. Limited information on PAR conversion factors as a function of solar elevation separately for the direct beam radiation and for the diffuse radiation has been provided in Ross ( 1975). Based on the work ofToom ing and Niilisk (1967) and Perelyot (1970), Ross (1975) presents conversion factors for the direct and diffuse components. When the solar zenith angle changes from 85° to 20°, CFdir ranges from 0.20 to 0.43 and CFdif ranges from 0.61 to 0.76. Ross also pre sents information on CFdjf as a function of cloud amount ranging from 0.68 to 0.48 when the amount of cloud increases from clear (0) to fully cloudy (10). Under certain circumstances, e.g., in dense canopies, it can be assumed that most of the light is diffuse. Under such circumstances, the use of CFdif would be more appropriate than the use of CF. 6. Summary Current estimates of the global C02 budget are not balanced. There is an uncertainty as to the relative contributions of oceans as compared to land, as well as an uncertainty whether vegetation is a sink or source of atmospheric C02. In order to be able to model ter restrial and oceanic primary productivity on all spatial scales, there is a need for global-scale information on parameters that play a role in this balance, e.g., PAR. We have demonstrated that it is now possible to derive this important biogeophysical parameter on a global scale from satellite observations. It is hoped that this capability will be of direct relevance to several issues of the global change research program. Acknowledgments.
