With an emphasis on Webe/s reference to Heine in the footnotes of The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, we seek to respond to and explore Gregory Höhn's (2002) observation that in the philosophy of history expressed in Heine's poetry and prose, Heine antici pates Weber's understanding of the process of disenchantment and its existential consequences. This discussion is the site for a consideration of the Enlightenment mythology relation. A particular emphasis is placed on devaluing reversal as a motif of the disenchantment-rationalization narrative in Heine and Weber, and how this motif relates to a condition of alienation. We explore the way in which devaluing reversal as an inner motif of the development of modern capitalist society finds an apposite expression in the religious image of the demonic. Keywords: Heine, Weber, disenchantment, rationalization, spiritualism, sensualism, asceticism, Protestantism, devaluing reversal, dialectic, demonic. Introduction: The Heine Reference in the Footnotes of the 'Protestant Ethic' In a footnote to Webe/s The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, Max Weber references the poet, writer of prose, and journalist, Hein rich Heine. The section in question to which the footnote corresponds, deals with the idea that the leading advocates of the ascetic movement with which Weber is concerned, had become consciously aware of what Weber refers to as the 'paradoxical relationships' implicit to their alliance with the methodical-rational pursuit of profit. Weber quotes a passage from John Wesley to elucidate his point. The footnote is used by Weber to suggest that this fact had been recognised long before he himself had emphasised it, and therefore that the criticism of this idea at the hands of Weber's contemporaries is questionable. © Max Weber Studies 2012, Clifton House, 17 Malvern Road, London, E8 3LP.</page><page sequence="2">96 Max Weber Studies The 'paradoxical relationships' Weber emphasises refer of course to the idea that the development of the 'elective affinity' between Protestant asceticism and the rational pursuit of profit, had unin tentionally motivated a secularisation and indeed a devaluation of the religious values of ascetic Protestantism itself. These 'paradoxi cal relationships' are thus emblematic of the process of the 'disen chantment of the world' and in this context, suggest the emphasis on 'unintended consequences' which colours Weber's philosophy of history. Specifically, these 'paradoxical relationships' point to the dialectical process of devaluing reversal which forms a tacit motif of Weber's understanding of the development of capitalist modernity and which, conceptually speaking, constitutes the properly tragic aspect of Weber's thought. Indeed, this tendency corresponds with the motif for tragic plot construction which in the Poetics, Aristotle determines as peripeteia: 'a change to the opposite in the actions being performed' (Aristotle 1996: 18 [6.3]). As Marianne Weber writes of her husband and of the Protestant Ethic thesis in particular: 'Weber seems profoundly moved by the course of human destinies.. .moved, above all, by the fact that on its earthly course an idea always and everywhere operates in opposition to its original meaning and thereby destroys itself' (Weber 1975: 337). Other than the citation noted we have come across no other explicit references to Heine in Weber's work, Marianne Weber is also mute on the subject. Given our single reference not to men tion Heine's notoriety, we can assume that Weber had some degree of familiarity with Heine or at the very least was aware of that ele ment of his thought to which the reference refers. However, there are striking affinities between elements of Heine's and Weber's thought which Weber himself apparently leaves untouched or unnoticed and which, we believe, are deserving of consideration. As the Heine scholar Gerhard Höhn has suggested, not only does the characteris tically Weberian theme of disenchantment fundamentally underpin Heine's understanding of historical development, but in his under standing of the existential consequences of disenchantment, Heine may be understood to have pre-figured Weber's own thoughts on the subject (Höhn 2002: 177). Although Weber's reference to Heine fea tures in a tacit discussion of disenchantment, Weber does not elab orate on Heine's significance in this regard nor does he enlarge on where or what of Heine is precisely of salience to his point. In the context of this dearth of explicit reference the aim of this paper is to explore a number of thematic affinities between Max © Max Weber Studies 2012.</page><page sequence="3">Button Thematic Affinities in Max Weber and. Heinrich Heine 97 Weber and Heinrich Heine and in this way 'fill-out' the point which Höhn highlights and yet which is left un-developed in his article. We want to use this discussion as an opportunity to re-visit the disenchantment-devaluation narrative, especially as it bears on the existential issue of alienation. In this context, emphasising the tendency we have referred to as devaluing reversal, we want to explore a thematic of capitalist development which in the tra dition of German philosophy and literature has tended to find an apposite expression in the religious image of the demonic. We will also re-visit the myth-making propensities of Enlightenment ratio nality and the disenchantment-enchantment dialectic. Our inten tion is to contribute to the continued appreciation of classical social theory and specifically the work of Max Weber in its engagement with modernity, and to argue for a socio-theoretical appreciation of Heinrich Heine's poetry and prose. To undertake this task we first need to consider Heine's reception in the German tradition of which Weber is a crucial part, recognising that the affinities between Heine and Weber represent one point in a broader historical, cultural and intellectual history. A Wounded Legacy: Heine and the German Tradition With Heine an entirely new epoch in the intellectual life of out nation began, and even if we may not count this epoch among our happi est, the energy of the talent with which he brought the dreary, sickly conditions of his time to poetic expression is nevertheless admirable and assures him of lasting memory (Anonymous obituary, quoted in Peters 2000: 70). Heinrich Heine was born of German-Jewish descent in 1797 and died in 1856 after suffering for eight years with a severely de-habilitating physical illness. Heine is probably most well known for his involve ment with the so called 'Young Germany movement', his Book of Songs (1827), the essay The Romantic School (1836) and the lyrical poem, Germany. A Winter's Tale (1844). However, these more widely known and regarded pieces comprise only a fraction of Heine's total literary output. Heine's poetry and prose is characterised by social and political criticism and commentary, inspired at least in part by the revolution ary utopianism of Saint-Simon, Hegel's philosophy of History, Hel lenism and pantheistic idealism. Importantly, Heine's social critique betrays a consciousness of contemporary alienation and fragmenta tion which looks beyond itself to an emancipated and just social © Max Weber Studies 2012.</page><page sequence="4">98 Max Weber Studies order marked by a fulfilled and unrepressed mode of life.1 In this 'social' emphasis Heine's thought displays an acute consciousness of the relationship between ideas and the power of ideas and social and cultural sensibilities and concrete formations. 'For certain', Weber writes, 'even with the best will, the modern person seems generally unable to imagine how large a significance those compo nents of our consciousness rooted in religious beliefs have actually had upon culture, national character, and the organization of life' (Weber 2002:125). Heine is a marked exception to the 'modern per sons' Weber identifies. Similarly to Weber and other thinkers such as Ernst Troeltsch, Heine points to a dialectical relationship between religion, lifestyle and culture in which the ascetic impetus of Protes tantism plays a major role. Moreover, much of Heine's subsequent thought, particularly his interpretation of contemporary culture and its consequences for human life and experience, is premised upon an interpretation of the historical dynamics of this interrelation of forces. In this regard, Heine explores themes which would later find a programmatic expression in Weber's sociology of the emergence of capitalism. Beginning in his own life time, the critical reception of Heine's work has been a controversial and dynamic affair. He is loved and hated, celebrated and denigrated, and argued over by endlessly com peting ideological positions: 'Calm, objective criticism, has not char acterized the literary reception of Heine' (Peters 2000: 2). Heine has been variously claimed and rejected by both the left and the right. During the Nazi regime a serious attempt was made to eliminate Heine entirely from the tradition of German literature. Indeed, as Habermas suggests, it is only really since 1945 that German intellec tuals have begun to re-discover Heine's significance for the German tradition, recognising in his life and work a 'shadow image' (Haber mas 1989: 96) of the modern intellectual, and a prophetic conscious ness of the destructive potencies of modernity. 'Only the revelations of the Nazi crimes', Habermas writes, 'have opened our eyes to the 1. In this regard much has been written of Heine's friendship with the young Karl Marx and the question of the reciprocity of influence between the two think ers. However, Heine's relationship to communism and to the idea of a communist revolution remains ambivalent and, as Bunyan (1997: 71-171) points out, Heine's utopianism, if it shared with that of Marx, was nevertheless of a different order. Heine was far too sceptical of the potential dangers of communism, not least in its atheism and levelling propensities, to accept it unequivocally as the answer to his Utopian aspirations. © Max Weber Studies 2012.</page><page sequence="5">Button Thematic Affinities in Max Weber and Heinrich Heine 99 monstrous and sinister things that Heine saw brooding even within our best, our most cherished traditions' (Habermas 1989: 92). This fresh appreciation (in which Habermas is but one voice) has in some sense rejuvenated Heine's work, and yet there remains sig nificant scope for further analysis of Heine's relevance for modernity. Long before Habermas' call for Heine's rehabilitation, Nietzsche had praised Heine as one of the höhere Menschen whom, along with Goethe, Napoleon, Beethoven, Schopenhauer, Richard Wagner and Stendhal, anticipated a new Europe 'transcending the nationalistic narrowness and boorish decadence of the late nineteenth century' (Peters 2000:101). Indeed, both stylistically and thematically Heine's work anticipates elements of Nietzsche's and there is an argument for the direct influence of the former on the latter (Spencer 1972). Heine's relationship with Karl Marx has also become a staple of the critical literature.2 The two thinkers had known one another per sonally and whilst Heine never threw in his hat with the Marxist ideal, he did sympathise (for a time at least) with elements of Marx's vision. Sigmund Freud's relationship with the thought of Heine has similarly become a topic of critical interest (Weigel 2010). A picture emerges of a Heine whose work stretches across dis ciplinary, political and social boundaries and which resonates with major thinkers of the German and more widely European tradition in the modern period. The thematic affinities between Heine and Weber with which we are concerned may be located in this broader context. In Weber7 s own day Heine was already a controversial figure and a source of critical debate. Nietzsche's aphoristic praise of Heine in Ecce Homo had a 'significance impact on intellectuals at the beginning of the twentieth century (Peters 2000:102), and writers such Thomas Mann, Heinrich Mann, and Hugo von Hofmannsthal spoke out in favour of Heine (Peters 2000: 104). Heinrich Mann would describe Heine as 'the prototypical example of the modern man' (Mann, quoted in Peters 2000:103), a statement which finds new expression in Habermas' depiction of Heine as a 'protointellectual': politically, socially and spiritually conscious, and dedicated to a 'radical demo cratic-humanism' (Habermas 1989: 76). At the same time, the Stefan George circle were highly critical of Heine, perceiving in his work a dilution and distortion of German language (Peters 2000:106). Habermas (1989: 85-86) points to Heine's 'sociological' conscious ness and yet an exploration of this strain in his thought remains wanting 2.

In 1956 (and in something of a Marxist reduction) Adorno would unforgettably describe Heine as a 'wound', criticising his lyrical poetic output for its complicity with the market forces of capitalism. However, we would argue that Heine's work contains a burgeoning critique of that same capitalist system or, more precisely, the modernity which encases it. Adorno himself at least 'praised the critical spirit of Heinrich Heine's prose' (Hohendahl 1999:177). Hei ne's work emphasises the destructive potentiality of disenchantment and rationalization, themes which are of course central to Weber as indeed to Adorno. The thematic affinities between Heine and Weber point to Heine's as it were, proto-sociological significance and to his contribution to the critique of modernity which takes shapes in 'clas sical' sociological thought from Marx onwards. Religion and Society: Heine's Spiritualism/Sensualism Dialectic In the intellectual and cultural history, Religion and Philosophy in Ger many (1835), Heine elucidates one of the characteristic problematics of his poetry and prose: the conflict between, on the one hand, what Heine refers to as 'spiritualism' or 'Nazarene spiritualism', and on the other, what he terms 'sensualism'. These labels denote two dis tinct although dialectically interrelated (Reitter 2002) psycho-social forces, synonymous with psychological and cultural types and which constitute specific historical modes of social and cultural organisa tion. As Heine explains: I do not employ these expressions [spiritualism/sensualism] to desig nate philosophical systems, but...to distinguish two social systems ('systèmes sociaux') of which one, spiritualism, is based on the principle that it is necessary to annul all the claims of sense in order to accord exclusive authority to the spirit; that it is necessary to mortify, to stig matise, to crush the flesh that we may better glorify the soul: whilst the other system, sensualism, reinvigorates the rights of the flesh, which neither ought to be nor can be abrogated (Heine 1986:40-41 [emphasis added]).3 3. Heine only uses the term 'social system' (système sociaux) in the revised and fully authorised French version of the work. In the un-revised and censored German edition (1835) he speaks instead of 'modes of thought' (Denkweisen). Although the French version was in circulation during Weber's lifetime, and if Weber had indeed read this work, it is more likely that he would have come across the censored German version. © Max Weber Studies 2012.</page><page sequence="7">Button Thematic Affinities in Max Weber and Heinrich Heine 101 This duality-dialectic has been acknowledged as a precursor to Nietzsche's well known Dionysian and Apollonian relation and, in more general terms, represents the German-Romantic predilection for duality and dialectic and the characteristic distinction of mythos and ratio (Spencer 1972: 133). Heine interprets his own contempo rary culture to be characterised by the system identified as 'spiritual ism' and which he associates with the world-view of Christianity and specifically with Christian asceticism in the reformed Protestant mould. Heine perceives asceticism as the expression of the primary 'idea' of Christianity, and by asceticism he refers to the active abne gation of all sensual pleasure and of the enjoyment of materiality. In Heine's thought, and rather questionably, Christianity becomes synonymous with negation, with 'the annihilation of the life of the senses' (Heine 1986: 38), the 'status naturae' to use Weber's (2002) favoured expression. As Weber observes in his own discussion of Christian asceticism: 'asceticism turned with all its force mainly against the spontaneous enjoyment of existence and all the pleasures life had to offer' (Weber 2002:112). In drawing a connection between Christian asceticism, social life, and the existential, Heine indicts Christianity for its propagation of a condition of alienation (although this later concept is not used explic itly). Spiritualism represents the inner fragmentation of the human person, for it involves his estrangement from the natural sensuality of his own being. This repressive estrangement comes to characterise a social and cultural order in which spiritualism dominates; it seeps into the pores of the socio-cultural nexus to become its definitive characteristic and accordingly the chief mode for its authoritarian propensities. For Heine, spiritualism is a mode of authoritarian dom ination, at once psychological and social. Sensualism, which Heine associates with Hellenic culture and mythology, is then perceived as the medium for human fulfilment and, as it were, 'homefulness', a return of the human person to the fullness of his own life. Sensual ism represents the liberating antidote for an implicitly alienated and spiritually authoritarian social order: '[Heine's] idea of sensuous ful filment encompasses fulfilment in external things, a society without coercion and deprivation' (Adorno 1991: 81). It must of course be noted that Heine's reading of Christianity is deeply prejudiced by a Romantic misunderstanding of asceticism which fails to perceive the proper place of Eros in Christian life and especially in asceticism itself. But what we want to draw out of Heine's dualism is not so much the specificity of its content as what © Max Weber Studies 2012.</page><page sequence="8">102 Max Weber Studies this content represents. For the duality-dialectic of spiritualism/ sensualism, Christianity/Hellenism, expresses a consciousness of a mode of alienation both personal and social, which Heine associ ates with the growth of capitalist modernity and with the culture of 'spiritualist' rationalism. The crucial point is Heine's recogni tion of the way in which the spiritualism/sensualism dialectic is embedded in the process of disenchantment and the corresponding rise of rationality, and thus, the manner in which these latter pro cesses represent 'sociological' a prions, as it were, of the alienation he associates with contemporary social life. Moreover, with Weber in mind, we want to explore Heine's association of the process of disenchantment with Protestant asceticism, for as Spencer points out: 'Heine sees a causal connection between Christian demands for asceticism, promising Elysium after death, and the established social and political order' (Spencer 1979:139). Protestant Asceticism and Rationalized Capitalist Culture Whilst Heine understands the spiritualism/sensualism dialectic to constitute a motif of human history (Heine 1986:62), much like Weber, Heine argues that the Reformation—the 'war' begun by spiritualism against the perceived sensualist corruption of Catholicism—had con solidated religious sensibility and religious power in a manner which proliferated an asceticism conducive to methodical-rational modes of thought and action. Although lacking the conceptual precision and epistemological self-consciousness of Weber, Heine similarly points to the way in which the ascetic impetus of (Puritan) Protes tantism had contributed to a situation in which rationality tended to usurp mysticism and become the chief arbiter in religious matters, thus contributing to the religious legitimisation and encouragement of what Weber refers to as the 'methodical-rational organization of life' (Weber 2002: 72). Heine's work expresses a deep concern for the way in this process contributes to the hegemony of an empty instrumentality. For Heine, instrumental rationalism represents the translation of spiritualism and spiritualist authoritarianism into the psychology of modern cultural agents and into the fabric of modern socio-cultural life: 'Humanity in our day worships a system of earthly utility' (Heine 1986: 76). We might pause here to consider the imagery of this statement. It is not simply that humanity lives by a system of earthly utility but that humanity 'worships a system of earthly utility'.

In this case, instrumentalism is elevated to the position of an idol as capitalist modernity promises fulfilment and realisation through the philosopher's stone of a disenchanted methodical-rationalism. The worship of utility represents the delusion of self-worship and anthropomorphism proper to all idolatry. In Weberian terms, the 'this-worldly' asceticism of Protestant Puritanism proliferates a mode of religiosity (even pseudo-religiosity) which squeezes out the transcendent and paves the way for the golden calf of disen chanted rationalism. Weber's 'specialists without spirit' (Weber 1930: 124), the spiritually hollowed out inheritors of methodical rational capitalist modernity are in Heine, the 'coldly-calculating... Bacchantes of reason', the protagonists of 'logical madness' (Heine 1895: 80-81). Again Heine's imagery is telling. The reference to bacchantic rev elry and therein to the votaries of the Greek deity Dionysus and to madness, suggests an intoxicating, possessed, even demonic aspect to reason-rationality. The votaries of the modern calculative sensibil ity are, through a paradoxical inversion, the orgiastic and intoxicated maenads of reason-rationality. Heine's prose piece, The Gods in Exile (1854) already suggests the presence of the bacchic in the midst of rational socio-cultural life, where the exiled Dionysus visits a young fisherman disguised as a monk, for Heine a symbol of the spiritual ist rationalist order. Quite literally, we are presented with Dionysus under the cowl of a monk: sensualism under the veil of spiritual ism. Later in the same work we are given 'the god Mercury, Hermes Psychopompos, the whilom conductor of the dead to Hades' (Heine 1934: 315), disguised as a Dutch merchant, symbol of rational capi talist exactitude. What Heine's Bacchantic imagery adds to Weber's 'specialists without spirit' notion is the idea that capitalist specialization, calcu lative rationality, and instrumentalism represent their own form or orgiastic intoxication. Scientific-rational culture becomes the frame work for the intoxication of the methodical and therefore comes to facilitate its own mode of inverted sensualism: the sensualism of rationality, instrumentality and order, a kind of inverted rational ized mode for a disenchanted ecstasis. In broader context, Heine's Bacchantic imagery returns us to the myth-making propensities of the Enlightenment highlighted by Adorno and Horkheimer (1997). Indeed, as Claussen emphasises: © Max Weber Studies 2012.</page><page sequence="10">104 Max Weber Studies The basic elements of their joint magnum opus, Dialectic of Enlighten ment, are already thematized in Heine's own works and implicit in his ambivalent reception in Germany, in particular the idea of the inexorable advance of a modern, enlightened culture that liberates self destructive forces' (Claussen 2008:24). Heine's suggestion (1827) that in the wake of Christianity the gods of Greece are exiled to dwell in disguise amongst the day to day affairs of mundane social life is a powerful metaphor for the sublimated presence of the mythic in socio-cultural life. As Reitter (2002: 203-204) points out, whilst Heine welcomed the Enlighten ment for its emancipatory potential he was nevertheless conscious that enlightenment rationality and universalism tended to foster its own form of mythology, and a mythology inimical to the Hel lenic sensualism he wished to see re-kindled. Here, as the classical symbol of lust, revelry, wine, intoxication and the theatrical, Dio nysus becomes the classical image for the intoxication of myth and the association of such intoxication with self-destruction. In The Gods in Exile Heine points to the self-violence of the bacchic through the image of the 'Corybantes in mad frenzy wounding their own bodies with short swords, seeking voluptuousness in pain itself (Heine 1934:310). We will return to these ideas in more depth in the conclu sion. For now we want to continue by engaging in a more detailed exploration of the disenchantment narrative in Heine's thought and how this narrative anticipates that of Weber. Disenchantment and Devaluation: 'the fate of our times' For Weber, the processes of rationalization and disenchantment [Entzauberung] represent the modern form of 'fate'. 'The fate of our times', Weber famously writes, 'is characterized by rationalization and intellectualisation, and, above all, by the disenchantment of the world' (Weber 1991: 155). Whether intentionally or otherwise, Weber's invocation of the ancient yet enduring concept of fate locates the disenchantment-rationalization narrative in a context suggestive of absolute issues. It is this same tendency of Weber's to create win dows to more fundamental issues, if only through the use of loaded language and concepts, which facilitates the association of capital ist development with the demonic which we find in the concluding pages of his study. What we wish to focus upon here, however, is how this refer ence to fate purveys Weber's sense that rationalization and dis enchantment tend to involve a process of cultural and existential © Max Weber Studies 2012.</page><page sequence="11">Button Thematic Affinities in Max Weber and Heinrich Heine 105 devaluation: Not only the disintegration of former values, for this is not of course necessarily a negative process, but a kind of hol lowing out of human life in and through the claims to 'progress' of methodical-rationalism. If we can speak of alienation in Weber's thought then it is certainly rooted in this process of devaluation and hollowing out, ideas which find their quintessential expression in Weber's image of the 'stahlhartes Gehäuse' - the 'iron-cage' (Parsons 1930) or, more literally, 'steel-hard casing' (Kalberg 2002). In the terms of Adorno and Horkheimer's Dialectic of Enlightenment: '[t]he curse of irresistible progress is irresistible regression' (Adorno and Horkheimer 1997:36). Weberian 'fate' represents a kind of curse and the Faustian trope emerges: the cause of modern capitalist 'progres sion' involves a pact with negation and devaluation. This is 'the fate of our times'.4 This association of disenchantment with devaluation and the identification of Protestantism as a decisive and concrete historical factor, brings us back as a point of connection to Heine's prose and poetry. Like Weber, Heine's stress on the consolidation of the Prot estant ascetic ethos as a 'social system', its increasing penetration of social and cultural life, and his subsequent commentary on the state of contemporary human existence under these conditions, are situated in an historical process characterised by 'disenchantment' or 'démystification'. As Höhn has suggested, the theme of démystifi cation serves as the central and in fact unifying principle in Heine's periodically capricious philosophy of history (Höhn 2002:177). This is an important point: the disenchantment narrative subsists irre spective of Heine's fluctuating affiliation to Hegelian dialectics. Heine's Religion and Philosophy in Germany depicts an historical progression entailing the overthrow of primitive superstitious religiosity by monotheistic Christianity, followed by the apparent overthrow of Christianity by the powers of an ever rationalizing reason. We find the same general development in Weber's sociology of religion. Heine elucidates an historical movement determined by three dialectically interrelated 'revolutions': religious, philosophical and social. Within this movement, the Reformation is central: the 'greatest...push in this history comes from Luther' (Schmidt 1986: ix). The philosophical revolution which grows out of the religious 4.

Under the banner of an Hege lian dialectic Heine elucidates a process which in and through the Reformation and the growth of Protestant 'spiritualism' bolsters the authority of a rationality which, paradoxically, will eventually come to undermine Christianity itself for the apparently higher purpose of an 'enlightened' humanity and harmonious social order. This is the 'synthesis' of the sensualism/spiritualism dialectic: not the rebirth of Europe through the emergence of a new mythology as Nietzsche had suggested in his youth, but a 'new era...ushered in by the forces of enlightened progress, epitomized in revolution' (Spencer 1972:133). The Protestantism-rationality relation indicates a general process of disenchantment which corresponds to the enthronement of spiri tualism as the dominant mode of psychological and socio-cultural life, and which becomes synonymous with rational capitalist moder nity and hollow instrumentality. The social revolution Heine seeks represents the overthrowing of the spiritualist order and the alien ation expressed in its instrumentalizing tendencies. Prior to Weber, Heine identifies an 'elective affinity' and even a causal link, between Protestant ideology, rationality and disenchant ment. As Heine writes: In declaring that his doctrine could be refuted only by an appeal to the Bible or on the grounds of reason, Luther conceded to human intelli gence the right to explain the Scriptures, and reason was acknowledged as the supreme judge in all religious controversies (Heine 1986: 50). The internal motif of these developments is one of reversal— peripeteia. Christianity becomes 'mortally wounded by philosophy [that is secular and secularizing reason] the enemy that it nurtured in its bosom' (Heine 1986:44). Kant's philosophy both facilitates and expresses the translation of the Protestant sensibility into a secular mode in and through which its explicit religious aspect will be then be banished. '[T]he philosophic revolution', Heine writes, 'as the off spring of the religious revolution, is nothing else than the last conse quence of Protestantism' (Heine 1986: 59). For Heine, Kant's Critique of Pure Reason marks nothing less than the 'death of God', the death of the tenability of belief in the personal God. Before Nietzsche then, Heine had already introduced this figure, albeit with an ambiguity and hint of lament lacking in Nietzsche (Spencer 1979:135-37) and whilst (in terms of secular culture at least) Nietzsche's 'message rang through Europe like a clarion call... Heine's words lay disregarded © Max Weber Studies 2012.</page><page sequence="13">Button Thematic Affinities in Max Weber and Heinrich Heine 107 on library shelves for many decades' (Spencer 1972:138). As Heine writes: 'Hear ye not the bells resounding? Kneel down. They are bringing the sacraments to a dying God!' (Heine 1986:103). Heine speaks of Kant's thought as 'destructive' and 'world-annihilating' (Heine 1986:109). He represents the Critique as 'the sword that slew deism' (Heine 1986:107), and Kant himself as the 'arch-destroyer in the realm of thought' whose 'terrorism' 'far surpassed' that of Robe spierre (Heine 1986:109). We must remember here that Heine 'is not at all concerned with theological or ontological speculation but with the effect which Christian religion has had on the individual and on society' (Spencer 1979: 136). Before Nietzsche and Marx, Heine had already directly suggested religion as an 'opiate', dulling the masses into submission (Spencer 1972: 141) and had pointed to the psychological mecha nisms active in this process. As Spencer observes: Christianity is seen and colourfully described by Heine as a psycho logical phenomenon in a triple sense: as a product of, and a palliative for, a certain state of mind, and as an influence in creating this state of mind; he regards the puritan ideal as the expression of a certain temperament and also as a factor in producing this temperament. By equating imbalance and deprivation with a form of sickness—the term 'neurosis' had not yet been invented—and concluding that our whole puritan culture is thus sick he points to Nietzsche, Freud, and beyond (Spencer 1972:143). Whilst Heine certainly welcomes the 'death of God', it must be emphasised that he is nevertheless conscious that the disenchant ment it involves is conducive of the kind of devaluation which Weber alludes to in the Protestant Ethic. Heine's comments suggest that the philosophical revolution and therein the growing hegemony of rea son-rationality is a form of 'terrorism' and thus a mode of violence. If it yields fruit then this fruit is bruised by, and the product of, terror and suffering: the alienation of disenchanted life, of the temporary exile, as it were, of the human spirit and imagination to the flat land scape of reason-rationality and to the levelling sterility of capitalist instrumentality. In this context, Heine's predilection for Hellenism and sensualism represents a desire for mythic re-enchantment and for the re-kindling of religiosity along pantheistic lines. For Heine disenchant ment is not enough but must be the seed bed for re-enchantment. We may observe that the violence Heine refers to here is actually the violence of reason itself. It is the violence of logic, calculation, order and system: 'Robespierre committed crimes of passion; Kant was eerily systematic in his destructiveness, and this, for Heine, © Max Weber Studies 2012.</page><page sequence="14">108 Max Weber Studies makes him all the more terrifying' (Reitter 2002: 204-205). Kant remains in the tradition of Heine's spiritualism, for 'Heine reads the enlightenment, and especially Kantian rationalism, as a kind of spiritualist violence against spiritualism' [i.e. against Christianity] (Reitter 2002: 213). But we would argue that such spiritualist ratio nality, in this very violence, is already replete with an inverted form of sensualism: This violence is spiritualist sensualism, the excess of spiritualism breaking out and yet remaining within the confines of its own mode. Here we perceive the mythic irrationality of the Enlightenment: 'Where the Enlightenment wants to stamp out myth completely, it is, paradoxically, at its most mythological. And this kind of "mythological thinking" is, for Heine, clearly harmful' (Reit ter 2002: 204). Rationality-reason becomes the vehicle for a modern disenchanted and negative mythology. What is most crucial for our concern with the Heine-Weber connec tion is Heine's grounding of this process in the Reformation (the reli gious revolution) and subsequently in the transmutation, as it were, of Protestantism in Kantian philosophy (the philosophical revolution). The Protestant minister, Nietzsche once suggested, is the 'Grandfather of German philosophy' (Nietzsche, quoted in Spencer 1972:142). Kant the freedom fighter is also, and implicitly, Kant the terrorist, Kant the executioner (Reitter 2002: 213). As Adorno and Horkheimer observe, in the disenchanted world of Kantian philosophy, '[tjhere is no form of being in the world that science could not penetrate, but what can be penetrated by science is not being' (Adorno and Horkheimer 1997: 26). The human horizon becomes limited, stunted by the authoritar ian epistemology of enlightenment rationalism. The result of Heine's philosophical revolution is the exile of being to the levelling abstrac tion of enlightenment (Kantian) violence—banishment, as it were, to the epistemic solitude of the disenchanted rationality which expresses itself in the atomized, reified culture of a burgeoning capitalist moder nity. In this culture, as Heine suggests in the Historien (Tales), there is the ever present danger of human beings being reduced to mere commodities (Phelan 2002: 299): 'The fate of our times is character ized by rationalization and intellectualisation, and, above all, by the disenchantment of the world' (Weber 1991:155). A Twist of Fate: the Disenchantment of Disenchantment In Religion and Philosophy in Germany which is saturated with ideals drawn from the French Revolution and with the claims of Hegel's pseudo-providence guided teleology, disenchantment is welcomed © Max Weber Studies 2012.</page><page sequence="15">Button Thematic Affinities in Max Weber and. Heinrich Heine 109 as a positive step in the unfolding of history toward a vision of abso lute realisation and human emancipation and to the re-enchantment of the world through a pantheistic religiosity. The alienation we have been discussing, where it is acknowledged by Heine, is in true Hegelian fashion subjugated to the fruits it will necessarily yield. With reference to this Hegelian framework, we can say that the dis enchantment narrative is subject to the enchantment of the category of historical necessity and immanence through which the normative dimension of its process is expressed. In short, disenchantment is perceived in terms of Hegelian mythology. The process of disen chantment is understood to both represent and carry within itself the emancipatory potential for a renewed manner of human social and spiritual life, and this irrespective of its devaluing tendencies. Alienation subsists as a dark shadow of brooding negative-positive energy on the road of dialectical immanence. The 'fate of our times' is disenchantment and rationalization but this fate is also the way of human emancipation. Heine's later writings, however, demonstrate a more sceptical and concerned perspective regarding the positive potentiality of disen chantment and the possibility of re-enchantment. As the Romanzero poem cycle testifies, in the writings of the Nachmärz, the period after the revolution of March 1848, disenchantment becomes synonymous with the vanquishing of authentic, meaning-filled existence and with a dearth in the spiritual, and that is to say, inner, quality of life. The slipstream of devaluation threatens the positive potentiality of disenchantment and thus compromises the Hegelian mythology formerly associated with it. For thirty years, in Freedom's struggle glorious, I've taken part in many a hope forlorn. I knew that I could never be victorious, But wounded must return, and battle worn. (Enfant Perdu) In the wake of the experience of devaluation, the enchantment of disenchantment itself becomes subject to disenchantment. Moreover, there are traces of this same scepticism and concern in Heine's earlier work (Höhn 2002). As we have already implied, even in the Hege lian vision par excellence of Religion and Philosophy in Germany, Heine implies disenchantment to be process which potentially leads to nihil ism if rationality-reason is left to reign at the expense of spirituality (Heine 1986:116). Heine's desire for the re-kindling of a pantheistic religiosity which perceives the immediacy of the divine in the created © Max Weber Studies 2012.</page><page sequence="16">110 Max Weber Studies already expresses a fear that the isolation-alienation of being conse quent of the Reformation and the philosophical revolution cannot be the permanent state of human existence. However, the danger implied is that the devaluation of disenchantment stifles the possibility for the dawning of such a re-enchanted religious consciousness. This same anxiety is seemingly pre-figured in Heine's early poem Twilight of the Gods (1827). The poem depicts the overthrow of heaven by quasi-Dionysiac pagan forces: They raise their iron ladders to the sky, And headlong storm the citadel of Heaven; Black dwarfs come clambering after; crackling loud, The stars of gold disintegrate and vanish. Rude hands tear down the golden veil that curtains God's tabernacle; howling as they tumble, The pious host of angels plunge to ruin. Upon his throne on high, the pallid God Plucks from his head the crown, and tears his hair A great cry rings out shrill through all Creation, The pillars crumble, Earth and Heaven topple Together, and old Night reigns over all. Whilst the poem anticipates a future world liberated from what Heine perceives as the existentially constraining and stifling aspects of the religious influence of Nazarene spiritualism, the outcome of the Götterdämmerung it depicts—the reign of old Night—is charac teristically ambiguous. The poem implies that the undermining or indeed overthrowing of the authority of Christianity—which as we have seen from Heine's later work is premised on disenchantment as an historical process — results in twilight, ambiguity, darkness. What is perhaps most interesting here is Heine's ambivalence. Much like Weber Heine suggests that disenchantment, although it has apparently liberated humanity from the constraining elements of primitive religion first and universalist monotheism second, has simultaneously, through its deconstruction of former legislative strat egies for life-orientation, created a kind of void. This void, we may assert, expresses the danger that the contemporary state of rational, instrumental, and alienated psychological, social and cultural life, becomes a trap, or to use Weberian imagery, a 'cage' or 'steel-hard casing', the end of which is quite naturally nihilism. The implication that neither Heine nor Weber pursues with any sustained explicit attention, is of course that this liberation is illusory, that it constitutes a mythology which, like all mythologies, is seductively self-contained and self-perpetuating. © Max Weber Studies 2012.</page><page sequence="17">Button Thematic Affinities in Max Weber and Heinrich Heine 111 Whilst throughout his life Heine 'held fast to the idea of uncur tailed happiness in the image of a just society' (Adorno 1991: 81), the writings of the nächmarz tend toward the attitude that history is essentially meaningless and given over to suffering (Höhn 2002). Where in the early period disenchantment is perceived as an implicit and welcome feature of the logic of dialectical progression, in the later work the interplay of thesis and antithesis is saturated with a sense of unwelcome paradox and irony. The unravelling of historical contradictions is now cast in darker hues and perceived to be replete with a fundamentally destructive element. Heine's conception of historical development becomes saturated by a sense of demonic contingency and, as a force of devaluation, disenchantment is seen to dominate over the immediate potentiality of a future and eman cipatory re-enchantment. Rather than aiding enlightenment disen chantment becomes a force of anti-enlightenment, of darkness. Modernity and the Supervention of Quotidian Rationality Following Reitter's (2002) interpretation of Heine's late work, The Gods in Exile (1854), we may argue that despite Heine's continued dedication to the goal of human emancipation, his growing scepti cism toward Hegelian philosophy coupled with his experiences of the 1848 revolution and his own physical demise through illness, had contributed to a re-formulated vision of historical develop ment in which the emancipatory moment and therein the possi bility of re-enchantment, had been dashed by what Phelan (2002) refers to as the 'supervention of the everyday', banal, routine aspect of urban modernity: The ubiquitous quotidian rationality of a methodical, routinised, instrumentalist order. For Heine, 'Moder nity... is an experience of standstill' (Phelan 2002: 304). It is really this aspect of routinised, disenchanted, rational modernity which shatters the mythology of disenchantment in its positive potential ity, just as the bourgeois regime, the keeper of a self-assured ratio nality, had suppressed the 1848 revolution. In The Gods in Exile disenchantment (and by implication rational ization) has itself compromised the immanent possibility of genuine re-enchantment, becoming entrenched in the mediocrity of reified, spiritualist, bourgeois culture. As Reitter points out, in this work the gods of Greece who for Heine had always been idealised representa tions of un-alienated existence, 'as ciphers for Hellenic sensualism' (Reitter 2002: 201-211) and thus a redemptive 'other', are depicted in complicity with the very spiritualist (Christian) forces which had © Max Weber Studies 2012.</page><page sequence="18">112 Max Weber Studies suppressed and exiled them: 'This implies that sensualism or mythic otherness has effectively sold out' (Reitter 2002:215). We have already seen this in the example of Dionysus under the cowl of a monk and Mercury as a Dutch capitalist. 'Here sensualism is complicit with superstitious Christian spiritualism as well as with the bourgeois mentality against which Heine had inveighed in earlier writings pre cisely on account of its denigration of sensualism' (Reitter 2002: 215). It is arguably this complicity which facilitates the sublimation of the sensual in the spiritual which we explored earlier. In The Gods in Exile, and perhaps most especially in the depiction of the god Jupiter as a haggard, weary and bitter old man living in solitude on a deso late arctic island, trading in rabbit skins with occasional sea-farers. The gods take on an ambiguous, worn out and impotent presence which bears little resemblance to their former status as a redemptive embracing of the multifarious vicissitudes of the human spirit and as a representation of a pantheistic religiosity and sensualism. Whilst the gods of Greece remain alive they are now deformed and void of their former power. They are exiled, hidden, disguised, isolated, and essentially powerless. The inverted sensualist spiritualism of reason and instrumentality which becomes the hallmark of bourgeois cul ture, expresses a mode of impotency and degeneration in which the gods of Greece become decadent monks, capitalists and broken old men. The emancipatory potential of the gods and more importantly the otherness in which it is located is diluted and in fact absorbed by the routinised 'spiritualist' culture of an evolving rational and disen chanted modernity (Reitter 2002). As Heine writes in conclusion to The Gods in Exile: Decay is secretly undennining all that is great in the universe, and the gods themselves must finally succumb to the same miserable destiny. The iron law of fate wills it, and even the greatest of the immortals must submissively bow his head (Heine 1934: 320). The image of the exile of the gods represents the dilution of resis tant otherness in capitalist modernity: the fact that forms of other ness are invariably infiltrated or shaped by the very rationality they seek to counter, and in such a way that their resistance is already circumscribed by that which they appear to resist. The point of concern for Heine is the possibility for genuine forms of resistant otherness to be maintained and realised in the face of the routinised and totalising tendencies of contemporary culture and spiritualist rationality (Reitter 2002: 224). Whilst expressed in a rather different context and idiom, we find the same problematic posed in Weber's © Max Weber Studies 2012.</page><page sequence="19">Button Thematic Affinities in Max Weber and Heinrich Heine 113 essay, 'The Religious Rejections of the World and Their Directions', originally published as 'Intermediate Reflection' in his sociology of religion. In the course of this essay Weber suggests that ostensibly a-rational or anti-rational forms of resistance to the movement of rationalization and disenchantment—the erotic and the aesthetic for example—tend toward rationalization when pursued in a rational vein. As Weber suggests in Science as a Vocation, when pursued con sciously as organised ideas, the spheres of the irrational, the only spheres that intellectualisai has not yet touched, are...raised into consciousness and put under its lens... This method of emancipation from intellectualisai may well bring about the very opposite of what those who take to it conceive as its goal (Weber 1991:143). We might again think of the ultimately ineffective sensualism of Heine's Dionysus in The Gods in Exile, periodically escaping his monastery at night to an island where he indulges his traditional sensuality, only to return again to his monastery. Here otherness is circumscribed, encased by the paternal oversight of that which it now only appears to resist, but which actually permits it to continue in the ineffective and even nostalgic superficiality of its now reified, complacent and anachronistic resistance. Weber's point is that those spheres of socio-cultural life which are potentially alternative and resistant to the drive of disenchantment with its slipstream of devaluation, when recognised and pursued as such, tend to be vanquished of their a-rational integrity and authen ticity. Following Reitter' s interpretation, in The Gods in Exile Heine points to a very similar dialectic. In something of a proto-Weberian manner, Heine acknowledges that the 'otherness' of sensualism can not sustain an authentic and integral form when confronted with the insidious power of disenchantment-rationality and of a commodify ing and instrumentalizing bourgeois culture, but instead tends to be diluted and therein undermined and devalued by precisely that to which it is ostensibly juxtaposed. Conclusion: Devaluation and the Demonic 'The Fallen nature of modern man cannot be separated from social progress'. (Adorno and Horkheimer 1997: xiv) In the development of Heine's thought, we witness a transition from a Hegelian and therein a secularised and pseudo eschatological faith in © Max Weber Studies 2012.</page><page sequence="20">114 Max Weber Studies human and thus socio-cultural progress, to a tacitly proto-Weberian sensibility in which history and human affairs are seen to be char acterised by a 'fate' which tends towards devaluation. As Lukâcs observes, Heine's work displays a 'movement of contradictions' (Lukâcs, quoted in Peters 2000: 119). The Romanzero cycle depicts a universe ruled by a 'god of chance occurrence' [der Gott-Zufall] more in likening to Dionysus than to the personal God of Christianity and to the providence governed universe of the idealists. Here, human affairs are caught in the flux of ascent, decline and ruin without there being an overarching context of meaningful becoming. Heine mocks the idea of 'world-harmony' with the counter claim of 'world-irony' (Höhn 2002:171-74). This is not the complacency of Romantic pessi mism but a re-formulated understanding of history derived from an interplay of existential experience and observations concerning social and cultural development in which disenchantment plays a major role. As Höhn suggests, in Heine's experience of the failed 1848 revo lution with all its blood, horror and injustice, and in his own physical collapse and demise through illness, Heine bound biography and history, fusing the individual and the collective in a manner which, 'for the first time [made the connection] between history and disease' (Höhn 2002:170). In the German tradition, this connection finds a later thematic expression in the work of Thomas Mann, particularly in The Magic Mountain and Doctor Faustus. In this fusion the disenchantment narrative operates on both the macro and micro level as devaluation affects both the social and the individual body. Vis-à-vis the poet's pen, Heine's body becomes, as it were, a realisation of social and historical devaluation and suffering, and in this sense becomes the site of disenchantment-devaluation in the immediacy of the existential condition of physical decline. Here, disease as an existential figure for disenchantment-devaluation becomes, in itself, a critique of the mythology of the Enlightenment and which corresponds with Heine's eventual rejection of Hegel's philosophy of history. The quotidian reality of suffering compro mises the reified abstraction of idealist thought and in such a way, we might argue, that suffering becomes its own form of enchantment: a kind of existential essentialisation which, in its particularity, shatters the reifying tendencies of modern capitalist rationality and of idealist philosophy, and which therefore constitutes a truly integral mode of (unintended) resistance. The late writings which bear such intimate testimony to Heine's suffering become critical documents in which decay and death become the existential modes where art (creativity) © Max Weber Studies 2012.</page><page sequence="21">Button Thematic Affinities in Max Weber and Heinrich Heine 115 realises its autonomous faculty for resistance. Here, disease becomes, as it were, a work of art (positive creativity) which affirms the imme diacy of life in the face of reification, commodification and the tyr anny of rationality in a disenchanted culture. It is interesting in this regard, that on his 'mattress-grave', Heine returns to monotheism and to faith in a personal God—but we have insufficient time to explore these connections further. As a thematic motif, the sense of contingency which charac terises the Romanzero poems and which serves as a critique of the naïve element in enlightenment and idealist thought, may be seen to more-or-less pre-figure that same motif of reversal and therein devaluation which we find in Weber. In the Protestant Ethic, Weber uses imagery which associates the tendency to reversal and self devaluation with the demonic, that is, with the seductive presence of malignant negation. For in his description of this process Weber inverts the self-definition of Goethe's Mephistopheles, the demonic 'spirit of negation', as 'A part of that same power that would/Forever work for evil but forever creates good' (Goethe 1999: 42 [1334-35]). And he inverts this statement in such a way that rather than faith in theodicy, we are left with an ambiguous cosmos to which God is absent, and in which the ambiguity of devaluation as a force of negation finds an apposite stylisation in the religious image of the demonic. This association is entirely appropriate when we recall that, in theological terms, one of the primary traits of the demonic is self-destruction and accordingly the insidious encouragement of self-destruction in human beings. As Weber writes, the 'methodical rational organization of life' derived from Protestant Puritanism, 'was the power "that perpetually wanted good and perpetually cre ated evil'" (Weber 2002:116). Of course, Weber is utilising imagery appropriate to his subject and he speaks of evil itself in terms of the original ideals of Protestant Puritanism, but the point remains that the reversal and indeed self negation in question finds an expedient expression in the demonic as the active presence of evil working in and through human affairs. Goethe's Mephistopheles offers self-devaluation and ultimately self destruction under the insidious guise of advancement. In Heine's words, 'the devil [has] so oddly shuffled the cards that it is now impossible to affirm with certainty anything about intentions' (Heine 1986: 44). Naturally, the religious figure of the demonic again casts the disenchantment narrative in a context suggestive of absolute, even eschatological, issues: good, evil, fate, destiny, and so forth. © Max Weber Studies 2012.</page><page sequence="22">116 Max Weber Studies Specifically, through this imagery, 'good' and 'evil' are identified as categories relevant to the 'fate' of modernity which is now seen to coincide with the process of rationalization-disenchantment (Weber 1991: 155). This reversal as self-devaluation represents an inner motif—the tragic peripeteia — of the process of fate. The seductive demon in the German tradition (most obviously Mephistopheles) represents the agent and mediator of this fate, the malignant med dler and tempter. Weber's sense that desire for good had paradoxically resulted in the proliferation of evil expresses the tragic tendency which, void of any larger sense of becoming and purposiveness, leaves Weber's vision shrouded in a heavy cloak of ambiguity. The development of capitalist modernity somehow insidiously involves a deal with the devil, a deal with the forces of negation, and in this vision, it is apparently Mephistopheles, for the mean-time at least (Weber 2002: 124), who triumphs. It hardly needs to be said that this is not the tragedy of redemption implicit to the Christian vision of becoming which we find in the theology of the historical Christian Churches of the East (Orthodox) and West (Roman Catholic), nor the pseudo theodicy of idealist philosophy, but an ironically secularised Protes tant pessimism in which becoming itself, or at least the sense of faith in becoming as a process, is the subject of devaluation. Any element of hope for the future or indeed of faith in Weber's Protestant Ethic thesis regarding the tendency of self-negating reversal is tempered by an intellectual asceticism which will not allow itself anything beyond the strictest this worldly sobriety (Weber 2002: 124). We might say that hope is here limited to spiritualist rationalism pre sented as a form of epistemological heroism. This is seen above all in Weber's Nietzsche and Burckhardt inspired 'pessimism of strength': a kind of radical Protestant heroism infused with ideals drawn from Greek antiquity and concerned with an illusion-free interpretation of the inner dynamics of the social realm and its potential futures (Scaff 1981: 70-71). Where Weber stood a generation after Heine, and was perhaps more immersed in a period conscious of the devaluation of former values and of the threat of cultural nihilism, Heine had, as it were, witnessed the fermentation of those socio-cultural and intellectual currents so crucial to Weber's social theory and to the existential con dition which, despite Weber's insistence on value-neutrality, it sug gests in its comprehension of modernity.

The rediscovery of Heine which Habermas (1989) has both indi cated and called for should, we would argue, include further explo ration of Heine's relationship to the thematics which have given shape to classical sociology in the German mould and which in the work of, for example, the Frankfurt school, persist as problems of the modern and even postmodern period. The thematic affinities between Heine and Weber sketched out here through an emphasis on rationaliza tion and disenchantment, represent one point of focus in the broader reception and resonance of Heine's work in the German tradition, and there is ample opportunity for further exploration of Heine's rel evance and legacy.
