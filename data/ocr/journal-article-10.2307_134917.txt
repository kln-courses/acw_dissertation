<plain_text><page sequence="1">On the substantive identity of the Ricardian and neo-classical conceptions of economic organization: the French connection in British classicism S A M UEL HOLLANDER / University of Toronto Abstract. The evidence discussed in this paper supports Alfred Marshall's insistence upon the essential continuity of nineteenth-century economic doctrine. The notion (common to both 'Cambridge' and 'neo-classical' commentators) of a sharp break between classicism and neo-classicism is shown to be untenable, considering, on the one hand, the Ricardo-J.S. Mill appreciation of the fundamental principles of allocation theory; and, on the other, Leon Walras's appreciation of long-run cost analysis. The British classical economists were, it is made clear, in accord with J.B. Say regarding opportunity cost and imputation. De l'identite substantielle des conceptions ricardienne et neo-classique de l'organisation economique. Le mat6riel discut6 dans ce memoire vient soutenir la position d'Alfred Marshall qui insistait sur la continuite essentielle dans l'evolution de la doctrine economique au dix-neuvieme siecle. On montre que l'idee (qu'on retrouve tant chez les commentateurs 'neo-classiques' que 'Cambridgiens') d'une cassure brutale entre l'ecole classique et l'ecole neo-classique est indefendable: une cassure entre l'appr6ciation des principes fondamentaux de la theorie de 1'allocation des ressources chez Ricardo et J.S. Mill, d'une part, et l'appreciation de l'analyse des couits en longue periode chez Walras, d'autre part. On demontre clairement que les economistes classiques britanniques etaient d'accord avec J.B. Say sur les questions de couts d'opportunite et d'imputation. STATEMENT OF ISSUES My paper is a contribution to the ongoing debate regarding the nature of the neo-classical developments of the 1870s, particularly the legitimacy of the term 'revolution,' which implies analytical discontinuity, as a valid description of those developments. This representation has become particularly topical, since the notion of a neo-classical or marginalist economics, contrasting sharply in analytical essentials with Ricardian classicism, constitutes a central theme of the historiography of the modem Cambridge (UK) School. The evidence discussed in this paper suggests, on the contrary, how useful in the present context is the notion of altered The Harold A. Innis lecture given at the meetings of the Canadian Economics Association, June 1982, University of Ottawa. For their comments and advice thanks are due J.K. Whitaker (University of Virginia) and Irene M. Spry (University of Ottawa). I owe a special debt to Tom Kompas (Western Ontario) for most helpful criticism of the various drafts, particularly the discussion on Walrasian pricing.

For what seems to have occurred in the 1870s was a narrowing of focus, specifically a greater concern with exchange and allocation in their own right; a sharpening of theoretical tools, particularly those relating to consumer choice; and the algebraic formulation of general-equilibrium relationships. These are developments which could have been absorbed by the traditional corpus of analysis, whereas the impatience of the marginalists and their apparent wish to wipe the slate clean meant that much of great import in clasical theory for their own chosen and relatively narrow sphere of discourse was not recognized, and spurious analytical distinctions were artificially reinforced. My evidence, in short, suggests how justified was Marshall's insistence, against both Jevons and Walras, upon the essential continuity of nineteenth-century doctrine: 'Under the honest belief that Ricardo and his followers had rendered their account of the causes that determine value hopelessly wrong by omitting to lay stress on the law of satiable wants, [Jevons] led many to think he was correcting great errors; whereas he was really only adding very important explanations' (Marshall, 1920, 10 n). Indeed Marshall found Ricardo's formulation of pricing preferable to that of Jevons, who 'substitutes a catena of causes for mutual causation' (ibid., 818). Gerald Shove's estimate of four decades ago stands the test of time: the analytical backbone of Marshall's Principles is nothing more nor less than a completion and generalization, by means of a mathematical apparatus, of Ricardo's theory of value and distribution as expounded by J.S. Mill. It is not ... a conflation of Ricardian notions with those of the 'marginal utility' school. Nor is it an attempt to substitute for Ricardian doctrine a new system of ideas arrived at by a different line of approach .. . [So] far as its strictly analytical content is concerned, the Principles is in the direct line of descent through Mill from Ricardo... (1942, 1960, 712). A preliminary word on the contrary positions may be helpful, first and foremost that of the marginalists themselves. Distribution was envisaged by Jevons (ideally) as a matter of service pricing 'entirely subject to the principles of value and the laws of supply and demand,' with input prices 'the effect and not the cause of the value of the produce' - 'I hold labour to be essentially variable, so that its value must be determined by the value of the produce, not the value of the produce by that of labour'; and cost of production as a reflection of opportunities foregone (1924, xliii f., 186). He accordingly directed his criticisms at the wage-fund and subsistence approaches to wage-rate determination and the cost approach to value - as he understood them - paying tribute to the French tradition: 'the only hope of attaining a true system of Economics is to fling aside, once and for ever after, the mazy and preposterous assumptions of the Ricardian School. Our English Economists have been living in a fool's paradise. The truth is with the French School ...' (ibid., xliv-v).1 1 Cf. Stigler (1965, 304): '[J.B.] Say's approach was fundamentally much more modern than that of his English contemporaries'; for an elaboration of this position, see Hutchison (1978, 84f.)</page><page sequence="3">588 / Samuel Hollander Jevons recognized elements of the 'correct' position in Mill's Principles- that rent enters into cost where land has alternative uses, that all inequalities (whether natural or artificial) generate economic rents, and the representation of demand and supply as a law 'anterior' to costs (ibid., xlviii, li, 197) - but could not resist remarking (in the context of the generalization of the rent concept) that 'those who have studied Mill's philosophic character as long and minutely as I have done, will not for a moment suppose that the occurance of this section of Mill's book tends to establish its consistency with other positions in the same treatise' (ibid., li). Walras, whose intellectual origins include par excellence J.B. Say (Schumpeter, 1954, 828), similarly objected to the classical pricing and distribution model (as he understood it) - particularly the cost orientation and the natural-wage approach. By neglecting a final demand dimension, and accordingly derived demand, the English had constructed an underdetermined system (1954, 434-5; cf. Jevons, 1924, 269). In more recent times we have the famous criticism of classicism along similar lines by Knight (1956). For Knight, of course, prices depend on the relative subjective appeal to consumers, the flow of goods and thus their marginal utilities governed by cost consideration, where 'costs' reflect alternatives surrendered rather than 'pain' in the sense of labour or abstinence. On this view the economizing principle involves maximizing the total return from any resource, by equalizing the increments of return at the margin to the scarce resource in alternative uses. It has been suggested (Arrow and Starrett, 1973, 132-3) that once the subsistence theory of wages broke down, 'the most natural alternative was to explain wages by the productivity of labour, an explanation only useful if labor was intrinsically scarce. In short labor had to be treated like land.' Moreover, recognition of the phenomenon of non-competing groups implied a multiplicity of primary factors which, so it is argued, 'required a new theory.' The founders of the neo-classical school 'understood the glaring omission of demand from the classical model.' In his Nobel lecture (1970) Ragnar Frisch neatly stated precisely that reading of the record that I dispute: The classical theory of value - as we find it streamlined in Stuart Mill - was essentially a theory of production costs ... there emerges a sort of gravitational force that pulls prices down. The cost of production is so to speak the solid base on to which the prices fall down and remain This theory contains, of course, an irrefutable element of truth. But it is too simple to give even a crude presentation of the forces at play. The economic process is an equilibrium affair where both technological and subjective forces are at play. The subjective element was nearly left out by the classicists. On this point economic theory was completely renewed in the years between 1870 and 1890 .... (1981, 5) As remarked above, the theme of a revolutionary break by the general-equilibrium economists from classicism is also a feature of modem 'Cambridge' historiography. Thus Joan Robinson: 'either there may be a tendency towards uniformity of wages and the rate of profit in different lines of production' - the classical position - 'or</page><page sequence="4">The French connection in British classicism / 589 prices may be governed by supply and demand, but not both. Where supply and demand rule, there is no room for uniform levels of wages and the rate of profits. The Walrasian system makes sense if we interpret it in terms of an artisan economy, where each producer is committed to a particular product, so that his income depends on his output and its price. Each can have a prospective rate of return on investment in his own line, but there is no mechanism to equalize profits between one line and another' (1961, 57). This observation is apparently based on the supposition that among the data of the Walrasian system are included the quantities of each and every specific kind of labour, capital good, and land. Following Piero Sraffa, Professor Roncaglia (1982 341-3) similarly represents the analytical core of neo-classicism as 'the model of pure exchange,' whereby perfect competition guides us to the optimal allocation of scarce resources. Prices are 'indexes of resource scarcity relative to wants; income distribution comes out as a by-product of price-determination, distributive variables being but the prices for the services of the so-called "factors of production." Production processes are only an intermediate stage connecting final consumers' tastes to the initial scarce resource endowments.' By contrast, 'classicism' is represented as a reproductive process (involving the 'production of commodities by means of commodities') wherein 'at the beginning of the production period, specific quantities of commodities are advanced, as means of production or as subsistence for the workers employed' - both technology (including the structure of production) and wages are exogenously determined - the utilization of which yields outputs exceeding the initial stocks, a surplus 'consisting of heterogeneous set of commodities.' In this system 'relative prices must be such as to allow all sectors a profit inducement to repeat the production sequence'; the spread between product prices and costs must generate a uniform rate of profit in all sectors, the average profit rate intself being determined solely by the exogenously given wage rate and technology.2 It is an essential part of the foregoing argument that in the classical system value and output levels are not determined simultaneously by the forces of demand and supply.3 This separation of value and output precludes the possibility that a change in the pattern of consumer demand can influence factor returns, and thus costs, by playing upon the relative scarcity of the factors: The divorce of value and output implies a divorce of value and distribution (cf. Dobb, 1973, 261; Garegnani, 1972, 278f., 1976, 24-45; Pasinetti, 1974, 43-4; Roncaglia, 1978, 119f). All this in contrast to Walrasian theory. Indeed, the paradigmatic contrasts have 2 See also the emphasis upon given endowments of resources as the peculiar characteristic of 'neo-classical' theory, in Walsh and Gram (1980, 152). Here, too, Walrasian economics is represented as an exchange system extended to allow for production, capital formation, and money, but isomorphically, remaining faithful always to catallactics (123). And a sharp analytical distinction is made between a classical economics concerned with the creation, extraction, and division of the surplus between accumulation and luxury consumption by the capitalist class, and a neo-classical economics, wherein social class is irrelevant, focusing upon the allocation of given resources among alternative uses by means of competitive prices (9-10, 125-6). 3 Cf. Pasinetti (1974, 12) on the absence of a demand theory in the context of profit-rate equalization: '[Ricardo] does not find it useful to enter into complicated details (and in his case they would have been very complicated indeed for him, who did not possess a demand theory).'</page><page sequence="5">590 / Samuel Hollander led to the charge that Walras was seriously inconsistent for conceiving the capital endowment of the community as a set of given quantities of 'capital-goods proper', yet also (in parts of his Elements) adopting the notion of uniformity of profit rates (Garegnani, 1976, 34, 36). * * * It is my contention that Ricardian economics - the economics of Ricardo and J.S . Mill - in fact comprises in its essentials an exchange system fully consistent with the marginalist elaborations. In particular, their cost-price analysis is pre-eminently an analysis of the allocation of scarce resources, proceeding in terms of general equilibrium, with allowance for final demand, and the interdependence of factor and commodity markets.4 Serious and long-lived misconceptions regarding classicism flow from a failure to recognize that the classical notions of wages and interest as compensation for effort and abstinence were pertinent only at the macro-economic level where the determinants of aggregate factor supplies are under investigation and not in the micro-economic context where costs referred to forgone opportunities.5 My perspective places J. S. Mill directly in the Ricardian theoretical tradition. That we find simultaneously in his Principles both 'neo-classical' and 'Ricardian' features implies neither inconsistency (Hollander, 1976) - or no more inconsistency than in Ricardo himself - nor a process of escape, or attempted escape, from his Ricardian heritage, a view expressed recently in the following terms: A silent revolution in the direction of the marginalist supply-and-demand theory was brought about [by Marshall] in the course of adopting, extending and transforming some ideas in Mill. As Mill himself had departed considerably from Ricardo, Marshall was thus moving even further from the Ricardian source (Bharadwaj, 1978, 254). It was precisely the beginnings in Mill of considerable deviations from Ricardo's theory of value and distribution that called for and received at Marshall's hands ... extensions and refinement; so that Marshall's deliberations on value and distribution departed systematically from the questions Ricardo posed and the framework of analysis he employed .... What Shove regarded as extensions and generalisations of Ricardo in [Marshall's] Principles (the introduction of the demand side, the functional relation between costs and output, the supply and demand determination of wages and profits) are radical departures from the Ricardian standpoint. (Ibid., 269)6 My perspective is one that avoids the difficult psychological problems posed by 4 As far as Ricardo is concerned, my argument here is an elaboration of that given in Hollander (1979, ch 6). I shall take for granted throughout the demonstration there given of Ricardo's appreciation of the 'demand schedule' - and the variability of the wage rate - although his position in this regard will be apparent in the citations below. 5 In the sense of forgone products alone, and excluding forgone leisure (cf. Robbins, 1970, 18). 6 That J.S. Mill in his Principles had turned or was in the process of turning his back on Ricardianism is a widespread belief; cf. for example Schumpeter (1954): 'the economics of [Mill's] Principles are no longer Ricardian .... From Marshall's Principles Ricardianism can be removed without being missed at all. From Mill's Principles, it could be dropped without being missed very greatly' (529).</page><page sequence="6">The French connection in British classicism / 591 interpretations that refuse to accept at face value Marshall's statements of his relationship with his classical forebears, or those of Mill regarding his intellectual relationship with Ricardo - his repeated insistence that he was elaborating upon Ricardian themes. The demand side, the functional relation between cost and output, and the supply and demand determination of wages and profits, far from being 'radical departures' from Ricardianism, are central to that doctrine without which neither the cost theory of price nor the inverse wage-profit relation can be understood.7 The second and third sections of this paper will demonstrate the key role accorded by Ricardo and J.S. Mill to opportunity cost and derived factor demand: their simultaneous and consistent attachment to cost theories of value and to the general-equilibrium conception of economic organization as formulated by J.B. Say and much admired by Walras. Such demonstration clearly has important implications for the nature of the 'neo-classical' developments of the 1870s. But we must also consider the reverse side of the coin, from which perspective it again becomes clear that the term 'revolution' to describe that doctrine is unhelpful. In his criticisms of Ricardo, Walras wrote that it is 'the price of the products which determines the price of productive services' (1954, 425). Similarly, he praised Jevons's statement of the ideal procedure according to which 'the formula of the English school, in any case the school of Ricardo and Mill, mut be reversed, for the prices of productive services are determined by the prices of the products, and not the other way round' (ibid., 45). This clearly does not constitute a picture of mutual interdependence between factor and product markets. It is in fact a statement that emphasizes what the classics had supposedly omitted, and does so by implicitly adopting a short-run perspective. My fourth section is devoted to a demonstration that Walras accepted the 'classical' conception of long-run cost prices - 'costs' incorporating profits at a uniform rate on the supply prices of capital goods - employing the Ricardian or Marshallian adjustment mechanism of output response to deviations between demand and supply prices. It also becomes clear that the charge of inconsistency for so doing is unfounded; for he insisted upon profit-rate uniformity, as Ricardo had done and as Marshall was to do, only when allowance is made for changes in the outputs of the different types of capital goods. (The same applies to labour.) Walras adhered to classical cost-price analysis given the appropriate long-run assumptions and, like Ricardo and Marshall, distinguished between 7 It is pertinent to refer also to the opinion that Thomas De Quincey corrected Ricardian value theory by stressing the mutual determination of exchange value by 'intrinsic utility' and 'difficulty of attainment,' a 'correction' which 'greatly influenced J.S. Mill's treatment of value in the Principles and which is in the Hutcheson-Smith tradition of value theory' (Groenewegen, 1974, 193). This is not to my mind a convincing evaluation. The 'mutual determination"' of exchange value by demand and cost considerations was a thoroughly central aspect of Ricardian doctrine. De Quincey may have believed he was 'correcting' Ricardo, but it is unlikely that Mill was convinced. It must be stated that Mill-studies are in a state of confusion. For the literature also provides assertions to the effect that Mill 'put the clock back' by subscribing to cost of production theories (Hutchison, 1978, 64-5n., citing Sowell, 1972, a view qualified by admiration for Mill's contri- bution to the theory of international trade with its evident demand dimension; Sowell, 1972, 159-60).</page><page sequence="7">592 / Samuel Hollander maximizing decisions regarding new investments and the actual return on capital goods once constructed. The fifth section will draw the threads of our analysis together. Brief consideration will then be given to the sources of some of the erroneous views regarding classicism described above. RICARDO ON ECONOMIC ORGANIZATION: THE SAY TRADITION We set out with J.B. Say's well-known statement in the Traite d'economie politique of mutual interdependence between product and factor markets incorporating the principles of opportunity cost and of imputing the values of factors from the values of their products - in broad terms only because of the absence of a marginal conception whereby the physical contributions of individual factors can be isolated: It is utility which determines the demand for a commodity, but it is the cost of its production which limits the extent of its demand. When its utility does not elevate its value to the level of the cost of production, the thing is not worth what it cost; it is a proof that the productive services might be employed to create a commodity of a superior value. The possessors of productive funds, that is to say, those who have the disposal of labour, of capital or land, are perpetually occupied in comparing the cost of production with the value of the things produced, or which comes to the same thing, in comparing the value of different commodities with each other; because the cost of production is nothing else but the value of productive services, consumed in forming a production; and the value of a productive service is nothing else than the value of the commodity, which is the result. The value of a commodity, the value of a productive service, the value of the cost of production are all, then, similar values when every thing is left to its natural course. (Cited in Ricardo, 1951, I, 282-3) Now Walras certainly believed Say to have been on the right road by this formulation of general interdependency (1954, 425). But so did Ricardo, who commented on the passage: 'M. Say maintains with scarcely any variation, the doctrine which I hold concerning value.' His sole complaint related to Say's treatment of the services of land on a par with those of capital and labour, in the light of his own (implied) presumption of one-use land (to be elaborated presently) whereby rent is excluded from (marginal) cost (1951, I, 283-4).8 Ricardo's subscription to Say's position cannot easily be appreciated in terms of those interpretations that envisage a sharp divergence between the 'British' and the 'French' traditions. Yet the notion of opportunity cost pervades Ricardo's work. Indeed his cost prices make no sense except in these terms. To this matter we now turn. It is inviting to identify Ricardian cost price with labour embodied, as Malthus in fact did, but it would be incorrect to do so: 8 See also Say's (1821, 12f.) doctrine of productive services, regarding which Ricardo wrote to Malthus: 'if he would give up rent, he and I should not differ very materially on that subject' (1951, vmII, 277) and to Say: 'In your doctrine of productive services I almost fully agree, but I submit to you, whether, as rent is the effect of high price, and not the cause of it, it should not be rejected when we estimate the comparative value of commodities' (ibid., 279).</page><page sequence="8">The French connection in British classicism / 593 It is necessary for me also to remark, that I have not said, because one commodity has so much labour bestowed upon it as will cost 1000 1. and another so much as will cost 2000 1. that therefore one would be of the value of 1000 1. and the other of the value of 2000 1. but I have said that their value will be to each other as two to one, and that in those proportions they will be exchanged. (1951, i, 46-7) Mr. M. ... misunderstands me ... I say its whole value will be in proportion to a portion of its cost, and I do not say this without allowing for modifications and exceptions - though I consider these of no great magnitude. I have said that the relative value of commodities is in proportion to the quantity of labour bestowed on them. That value may be double what the labour cost. (1951, II, 100-2) 'Cost of production' or natural price thus includes profits as well as wages each at its average or ordinary rate as Smith had explained (1951, I, 291). Under the appropriate technological conditions defined in the first chapter of the Principles (namely uniform factor proportions) a state of general equilibrium, such that prices reflect costs throughout the system, will be one satisfying the principles of profit rate (and wage rate) equalization and proportionality of prices to labour inputs. More accurately, under the stated circumstances uniformity of profit rates (and wage rates) require that proportionality. The following passage (drawn from a discussion of subsidized labour for some firms in a manufacturing industry) beautifully summarizes the point, and does so in a context expressing that what is relevant is marginal labour input: 'The manufacturer enjoying none of these facilities might indeed be driven altogether from the market, if the supply afforded by these favored workmen were equal to all the wants of the community; but if he continued in the trade, it would be only on condition that he should derive from it the usual and general rate of profits on stock, and that could only happen when his commodity sold for a price proportional to the quantity of labor bestowed on its production' (1951, i, 73n; my emphasis). Now it is the possibility of capital (and labour) movement between uses or commodity-supply adjustment that assures the tendency to cost price and proportion- ality to labour input - a matter of great importance that is apparently denied by Cambridge writers and others. This can be illustrated from the discussion of an exogenous change in tastes: Let us suppose that all commodities are at their natural price, and consequently that the profits of capital in all employments are exactly at the same rate .... Suppose now that a change of fashion should increase the demand for silks, and lessen that of woollens; their natural price, the quantity of labour necessary for their production, would continue unaltered, but the market price of silks would rise, and that of woollens would fall; and consequently the profits of the silk manufacturer would be above, whilst those of the woollen manufacturer would be below, the general and adjusted rate of profits. Not only the profits, but the wages of the workmen, would be affected in these employments. This increased demand for silks would however soon be supplied, by the transference of capital and labour from the woollen to the silk manufacture; when the market prices of silks and and woollens would again approach their natural prices, and then the usual profits would be obtained by the respective manufacturers of those commodities. It is then the desire, which every capitalist has, of diverting his funds from a less to a more profitable employment, that prevents the market price of commodities from continuing for any length of time either much above, or much below their natural price. It is this competition,</page><page sequence="9">594 / Samuel Hollander which so adjusts the exchangeable value of commodities, that after paying the wages necessary to their production, and all other expences required to put the capital employed in its original state of efficiency, the remaining value or overplus will in each trade be in proportion to the value of the capital employed. (Ibid., I, 90-1; my emphasis) In circumstances of differential factor ratios the same assumption of factor mobility dictates a divergence of (relative) cost prices from (relative) labour inputs as Ricardo explained at length in his first chapter. But the entire notion of cost price presumes factors that have alternative uses; and in all cases, whether or not costs are proportional to labour inputs, only those returns that reflect alternative opportunities are allowed for in costs. Embodiment of labour, or for that matter the pain cost attached to labour and abstinence are not in themselves the relevant consideration,9 as is clear from the fact that since 'it is through the inequality of profits that capital is moved from one employement to another' (ibid., 119), an economy-wide change in labour productivity or the wage rate or any other disturbance will leave cost prices unaltered should all commodities be impinged upon equally. The implications of this perspective are legion. For example, from the context of public finance: From this circumstance [the differential impact on agriculture of the poor rates] it follows, that the farmer will be enabled to raise the price of his produce by the whole difference. For since the tax falls unequally, and peculiarly on his profits, he would have less motive to devote his capital to the land, than to employ it in some other trade, were not the price of raw produce raised. If, on the contrary, the rate had fallen with greater weight on the manufacturer than on the farmer, he would have been enabled to raise the price of his goods by the amount of the difference, for the same reason that the farmer under similar circumstances could raise the price of raw produce ... ; for there can be no reason why their profits should be reduced below the general rate of profits, when their capitals might be easily removed to agriculture. (Ibid., 260-1) The conception in question bears strategically upon the nature of trade: 'If any cause should raise the price of a few manufactured commodities, it would prevent or check their exportation; but if the same cause operated generally on all, the effect would be merely nominal, and would neither interfere with their relative [cost] value, nor in any degree diminish the stimulus to a trade of barter, which all commerce, both foreign and domestic really is' (ibid., 228). And the principle that cost prices reflect alternative opportunities provides the rationale for the fundamental theorem of distribution itself - the inverse wage-profit relation. A general wage increase either leaves cost prices entirely unaffected, thus forcing down profits (the special case of identical factor proportions), or, by disturbing the structure of profit rates, sets in motion appropriate supply adjustments that lead to the establishment of a new cost structure, assuring again uniform profit rates in all industries albeit at a lower general level (Hollander, 1979, 302f). One also should not forget that although disturbances to the wage structure were 9 Although a good case can be made whereby Ricardo allowed that the profit rate contains a reward for abstinence and thus acts upon accumulation; Hollander (1979, ch. 7).</page><page sequence="10">The French connection in British classicism / 595 largely set aside by Ricardo, the rationale for this procedure was reliance upon the operation of 'competition' - the demand-supply mechanism - which assured a pattern of relativities reflecting 'the comparative skill of the labourer, and intensity of the labour performed' (1951, I, 20). It will be apparent that Ricardo's cost prices make no sense except within a demand-supply framework allowing for alternative uses of resources. Yet Ricardo is frequently said to have rejected demand-supply analysis (except perhaps for market price determination). This is a misconception. What he actually complained of was 'the opinion that the price of commodities depends solely on the proportion of supply to demand or demand to supply (1951, I, 382; my emphasis), a complaint alluding to those formulations that appeared to exclude a role for cost conditions in the mechanism. Thus his observation to Say: 'You say demand and supply regulates the price of bread; that is true, but what regulates supply? the cost of production ...' (1951, IX, 172). Indeed, Ricardo's point (as is apparent from the following reaction to the treatment by Say of a commodity tax) was precisely that Say had failed to follow out the logic of his own approach to pricing which runs in terms of alternative uses: It is observed by M. Say, 'that a manufacturer is not enabled to make the consumer pay the whole tax levied on his commodity, because its increased price will diminish its consumption.' Should this be the case, should the consumption be diminished, will not the supply also speedily be diminished? Why should the manufacturer continue in the trade if his profits are below the general level? M. Say appears here also to have forgotten the doctrine which he elsewhere supports, 'that the cost of production determines the price, below which commodities cannot fall for any length of time, because production would be then either suspended or diminished.' (1951, I, 243n) The essence of the whole matter is captured exquisitely in a letter to Malthus: 'You say demand and supply regulates value - this I think is saying nothing ... -- it is supply which regulates value - and supply is itself controlled by comparative cost of production' (1951, vmii, 279; my emphasis). * * * On matters of principle Ricardo's line is that of Lausanne: equality of wage rates and of profit rates maximize the return to the factors 'capital' and 'labour.' 10 Moreover, it must be emphatically stated that these average returns themselves are, in principle, variables governed by the relative scarcity of the factors: 'I have invariably insisted, that high or low profits depend on low and high wages, how then can it be justly said of me that the only cause which I have recognized of high or low profits is the facility or difficulty of providing food for the labourer?' - since to this day it is frequently said of Ricardo; 'I contend that I have also recognized the other causes, the relative amount of population to capital, which is another of the great regulators of wages' 10 This is sometimes conceded by Knight (1956, 41-2n., 63) and Schumpeter (1954, 590), despite their generally critical approaches to Ricardian economics from a neo-classical perspective.</page><page sequence="11">596 / Samuel Hollander (1951, II, 264-5). " On this view, and keeping in mind Ricardo's further insistence that 'the power of employing labour depends on the increase of a particular part of capital, not on the increase of the whole capital' (1951, IX, 127), the way is open for an allowance that the adjustment process following a variation in the pattern of final demand itself will affect the average factor returns. In short, output levels can affect relative cost prices by playing upon the relative scarcity of labour and capital, an outcome in line with neo-classical theorizing. * * * We can sharpen our understanding of Ricardo's position on the nature of cost price by considering the contrast between costs and rents. I shall first establish Ricardo's awareness that the phenomenon of differential rent, which plays so large a part in his system, is but a special case of a more general phenomenon - land scarcity. Rent is provisionally defined as the payment to the landlord 'for the use of the original and indestructible powers of the soil' (1951, I, 67) - a productivity phenomenon. But in the following passage the ultimate rationale is more specifically expressed in terms of productivity and scarcity (demand and supply): On the first settling of a country, in which there is an abundance of rich and fertile land, a very small proportion of which is required to be cultivated for the support of the actual population, or indeed can be cultivated with the capital which the population can command, there will be no rent; for no one would pay for the use of land, when there was an abundant quantity not yet appropriated, and, therefore, at the disposal of whosoever might choose to cultivate it. On the common principles of supply and demand, no rent could be paid for such land, for the reason stated why nothing is given for the use of air and water, or for any other of the gifts of nature which exist in boundless quantity. With a given quantity of materials, and with the assistance of the pressure of the atmosphere, and the elasticity of steam, engines may perform work and abridge human labour to a very great extent; but no charge is made for the use of these natural aids, because they are inexaustible, and at every man's disposal. In the same manner the brewer, the distiller, the dyer, make incessant use of the air and water for the production of their commodities; but as the supply is boundless, they bear no price. (Ibid., 69) Here J.B. Say is cited to the same effect: 'The earth ... is not the only agent of nature which has a productive power; but it is the only one, or nearly so, that one set of men take to themselves, to the exclusion of others; and of which, consequently, they can appropriate the benefits.' Using these principles Ricardo rejected physiocratic residues in the Wealth of Nations, specifically the notion that in manufactures 'nature does nothing, man does all; and the reproduction must always be in proportion to the strength of the agents that occasion it.' Factor productivity, runs Ricardo's argument, is a necessary but insufficient condition for a positive return: 11 And Ricardo himself referred to the relation between wages and profits in terms of 'equilibrium' (1951, i, 226).</page><page sequence="12">The French connection in British classicism / 597 Does nature nothing for man in manufactures? Are the powers of wind and water, which move our machinery, and assist navigation, nothing? The pressure of the atmosphere and the elasticity of steam, which enable us to work the most stupendous engines - are they not the gifts of nature? to say nothing of the effects of the matter of heat in softening and melting metals, of the decomposition of the atmosphere in the process of dyeing and fermentation. There is not a manufacture which can be mentioned, in which nature does not give her assistance to man, and give it too generously and gratuitously. (Ibid., 76n) Now differential rent (reflecting productivity differentials) is simply a special case of the genus, scarcity rent: 'If all land had the same properties, if it were all unlimited in quantity, and uniform in quality, no charge could be made for its use, unless it possesses peculiar advantages of situation' (ibid., 69). Similarly: '[if] air, water, the elasticity of steam, and the pressure of the atmosphere, were of various qualities; if they could be appropriated, and each quality existed only in moderate abundance, they, as well as the land, would afford a rent, as the successive qualities were brought into use' (ibid., 75). Differential rent is not to be understood as falling outside the general demand-supply framework. Secondly, Ricardo stated clearly the conditions under which rent would appear even on marginal units of output (absolute rent) - namely, where scarcity manifests itself in an extreme form, the supply curve of agricultural produce becoming, as it were, vertical (the functional relation between output and costs terminating); and he traced through some of the analytical consequences: The corn and raw produce of a country may, indeed, for a time sell at a monopoly price; but they can do so permanently only when no more capital can be profitably employed on the lands, and when, therefore, their produce cannot be increased. At such time, every portion of land in cultivation, and every portion of capital employed on the land will yield a rent, differing, indeed, in proportion to the difference in the return. At such time too, any tax which may be imposed on the farmer, will fall on rent, not on the consumer. He cannot raise the price of his corn, because by the supposition, it is already at the highest price at which the purchasers will or can buy it. He will not be satisfied with a lower rate of profits, than that obtained by other capitalists, and, therefore, his only alternative will be to obtain a reduction of rent or to quit his employment. (Ibid., 250-1)12 I spell all this out in order to emphasize Ricardo's comprehension of the general principle of scarcity price both where land differentials exist and where they do not; he went along with Buchanan's statement that 'rent is the effect of high price .... It is ... from the price which the produce is sold, that the rent is derived; and this price is got not because nature assists in the production, but because it is the price which suits the consumption to the supply' (ibid., 77n). To my knowledge Ricardo nowhere explicitly states that rent cannot be excluded 12 Cf. ibid. (252): 'I hope I have made it sufficiently clear, that until a country is cultivated in every part' (an allusion to the extensive margin) 'and up to the highest degree' (an allusion to the intensive margin), 'there is always a portion of capital employed on the land which yields no rent, and that it is this portion of capital, the result of which, as in manufactures, is divided between profits and wages that regulates the price of corn'.</page><page sequence="13">598 / Samuel Hollander from cost, notwithstanding the fact that the aggregate supply conditions of land differ from those of capital and labour, in the case of multi-use land. Yet I believe that he appreciated the logic. Consider in particular the generalization of the rent concept from land to capital - the very explicit recognition that once the assumption of capital mobility between uses is abandoned it is the rent analysis that becomes appropriate: As a part of this capital, when once expended in the improvement of a farm, is inseparably amalgamated with the land, and tends to increase its productive powers, the remuneration paid to the landlord for its use is strictly of the nature of rent, and is subject to all the laws of rent. Whether the improvement be made at the expense of the landlord or the tenant, it will not be undertaken in the first instance, unless there is a strong probability that the return will at least be equal to the profit that can be made by the disposition of any other equal capital; but when once made, the return obtained will ever after be wholly of the nature of rent, and will be subject to all the variations of rent. (Ibid., 262) This principle was in fact utilized in an argument against those who opposed freer corn importation on grounds of capital immobility: 'Suppose,' Ricardo reasoned, 'that the fact be as stated and that no part of the capital could be withdrawn; the farmer would continue to raise corn, and precisely the same quantity too, at whatever price it might sell; for it could not be his interest to produce less, and if he did not so employ his capital, he would obtain from it no return whatever' (ibid., 269). There are also the similar effects of a tax on rent (ibid., 257) and a tax on profits-in-general - in neither case (even allowing capital mobility) can the tax be escaped by way of allocative readjustments. Of course, a fall in the (net) profit rate may subsequently play on the rate of capital accumulation and thus the wage rate, but this is a matter relating to long-run aggregate supply conditions. Also relevant is the recognition in the context of foreign trade that once the possibility of resource mobility between uses is ruled out, the general rules of cost-price break down. Even assuming uniform capital-labour ratios, commodities will no longer exchange in proportion to relative labour inputs: 'The difference in this respect, between a single country and many, is easily accounted for, by considering the difficulty with which capital moves from one country to another, to seek a more profitable employment, and the activity with which it invariably passes from one province to another in the same country' (ibid., 135-6). * * * We return now to the passage cited above from J.B. Say, which Ricardo applauded: the doctrine of productive services. This passage explicitly spells out the principle of opportunity costs and the closely related argument that the source of factor returns (and the motive for the use of factors) in any use is final demand. While the final demand dimension leaps to the eye in the case of (single-use) land, it is no less pertinent in the case of those returns that enter into cost price. 3 For to refer to cost 13 This point is frequently neglected. See below, 611.</page><page sequence="14">The French connection in British classicism / 599 price is merely to say that demand in any sector is sufficient to meet the competition of demand elsewhere for the use of resources. There should be no surprise at Ricardo's acceptance of the Say formulation. What, however, are we to make of Ricardo's subscription to the wages-fund theory and its corollary, as expressed by Mill's fourth proposition on capital, that 'demand for commodities is not demand for labour'? For it was Jevons's complaint precisely that according to this propostion (which he rightly observed originated with Ricardo), capitalists 'maintain and pay for labor whether or not there is a demand for the commodities produced' and 'production goes on independently of the use to which the produce is to be put' (1905, 127). This complaint is unjustified. Nothing in the fourth proposition conflicts with derived demand, since it relates in no way to the individual capitalist's motivation in offering employment. It is a description of the manner in which the aggregate demand for labour and thus the aggregate wage bill (reflecting either higher average earnings or higher employment or both) is expanded. Thus it is that for the reabsorption of labour displaced by machinery Ricardo relied in part upon increased demand for service labour out of net revenue and in part upon net accumulation. That a transfer by capitalists from consumption expenditure to investment raises labour demand is easily demonstrable (Hollander, 1979, 326f). That the same holds true of a transfer from consumption to expenditure on services is clarified in Ricardo's chapter 'On Machinery.' The altered pattern of consumption from commodities to services encourages an expansion of the agricultural sector; labourers displaced in the consumer-goods sector are not, as it were, simply reabsorbed in the service sector but are reabsorbed in expanding agricultural production to meet the consumption requirements of the (additional) service labour, a sequence of events corresponding to that entailed by 'savings from revenue to add to capital' (ibid., 373f). Similarly, it can be shown that Ricardo's discussion of the demand for labour in no way precludes an approach to economic organization in terms of 'synchronized' activity as some writers during the 1870s believed.14 Ricardo firmly rejected the notion of a literal pre-accumulation of stocks of wage-goods advanced by employers and constituting the demand for labour. Workers, he insisted, are paid in money that is disbursed by them directly at retail in the manner of all consumers, the quantity and character of the commodities produced reflecting that demand: 'I dispute your position,' he wrote to Malthus, 'that a demand for labour is the same thing as a supply of necessaries' (1951, viii, 258). What was involved, rather, was a direction of activity towards wage-goods production in appropriate response to the volume and pattern of labourers' consumption - the volume alone governed by capitalists' savings decisions. 14 'It is not necessary to the production of things that cannot be used as subsistence or cannot be immediately utilized, that there should have been a previous production of the wealth required for the maintenance of the labourers while the production is going on. It is only necessary that there should be, somewhere within the circle of exchange, a contemporaneous production of sufficient subsistence for the labourers, and a willingness to exchange this subsistence for the thing on which the labour is being bestowed' (George, 1879, 24).</page><page sequence="15">600 / Samuel Hollander J.S. MILL ON ECONOMIC ORGANIZATION On all these matters J.S. Mill was entirely at one with Ricardo. The theory of costs was treated from a micro-economic perspective involving relative value and the motives underlying resource allocation; indeed, his appreciation of the relativity of exchange value is nowhere expressed more clearly than in the context of costs of production. 'Value is a relative term,' he wrote in his chapter on the 'Ultimate Analysis of Cost of Production,' 'not a name for an inherent and substantive quality of the thing itself' (1965, 479). Accordingly, he defended the emphasis upon labour in Ricardo's treatment of value - despite the fact that the primary costs to be met by the capitalist-employer are wage costs - on the grounds that 'in considering ... the causes of variations in value, quantity of labour is the thing of chief importance; for when that varies, it is generally in one or a few commodities at a time, but the variations of wages (except passing fluctuations) are usually general, and have no considerable effect on value' (ibid., 481). None the less, wage differentials will be reflected in the price structure, as well as relative labour inputs and changes in wage differentials will generate changes in the price structure: 'Although, however, general wages, whether high or low, do not affect values, yet if wages are higher in one employment than another, or if they rise and fall permanently in one employment without doing so in others, these inequalities do really operate on values ...' (ibid., 480; also 692). The same principles applied to profits: 'Values ... being purely relative, cannot depend upon absolute profits, no more than upon absolute wages, but upon relative profits only .... Insofar as profits enter into the cost of production of all things [equally] they cannot affect the value of any. It is only by entering in a greater degree into the cost of production of some things than of others, that they can have any influence on value' (ibid., 482). By this latter allowance Mill had in mind more than the consequence for the price structure of profit-rate differentials reflecting unequal risk and so forth. The allowance covered compensation for differential time periods of production from industry to industry: 'one commodity may be called upon to yield profit during a longer period than the other.' In consequence of differential factor proportions it followed that 'commodities do not exchange in the ratio simply of the quantities of labour required to produce them,' (ibid., 484), and this quite apart from the complication created by partial wage changes. Even general wage changes might influence the structure of prices: 'even a general rise of wages, when it involves a real increase in the cost of labour, does in some degree influence values. It does not affect them in the manner vulgarly supposed, by raising them universally. But an increase in the cost of labour lowers profits; and therefore lowers in natural value the things into which profits enter in a greater proportion than the average, and raises those into which they enter in a less proportion than the average' (ibid., 485). We must here have in mind Mill's repeated insistence, always following Ricardo, that changes in production costs exert their influence by way of supply variation. Let us recall the opinion, expressed by Malthus in 1824 (and repeated ever since), that Ricardo had limited demand-supply analysis solely to the market period and cases of</page><page sequence="16">The French connection in British classicism / 601 monopoly, treating long-run cost price quite independently; the two theories were mutally exclusive (1963, 181-2). Mill rejected Malthus's attribution as soon as it appeared, insisting that in the opinion of the Ricardo school long-run cost prices were arrived at by way of supply variation (1967, 33-4). In the chapter in the Principles, 'Of Demand and Supply, in their Relation to Value,' reference is indeed made to 'another law [than that of demand and supply] for that much larger class of things, which admit of indefinite multiplication'; but immediately thereafter we find a caution that in dealing with production costs, 'it is not less necessary to conceive distinctly and grasp firmly the theory of this exceptional case' (that of given supplies), which 'will be found to be of great assistance in rendering the more common case intelligible' (1965, 468). The point is clear enough: 'The value at any particular time is the result of supply and demand,' but 'unless that value is sufficient to repay the Cost of Production, and to afford, besides, the ordinary expectation of profit, the commodity will not continue to be produced'. Necessary price, in brief, includes a return on capital 'as great ... as can be hoped for in any other occupation at that time and place,' and in the event of a return in excess of the going rate 'capital rushes to share in this extra gain, and by increasing the supply of the article, reduces its value'; conversely, in the reverse case output is restricted (ibid., 471-2). And it is in this sense that one may easily appreciate the famous reference to 'a law of value anterior to cost of production, and more fundamental, the law of demand and supply' (ibid., 583). Here Mill did not intend to deny, any more than Ricardo, that cost of production works its influence by way of supply variations. His point was that demand-supply analysis applied to all cases, even where cost analysis was irrelevant- an appropriate perspective in a chapter dealing with 'Some Peculiar Cases of Value.' The general conclusion regarding the central role of supply variation in the establishment of cost price is scarcely surprising in the light of Mill's observation that the pertinent perspective in cost-price analysis is one involving 'the motives by which the exchange of commodities against one another is immediately determined.'15 Numerous explicit allusions to relative supply variation will be found precisely in this context; the higher value of commodities produced in industries entailing a relatively high degree of unpleasantness or a relatively longer period of production, or a differential tax are all explained in terms of appropriate supply restraints (ibid., 482f). It is indeed in the 'general-equilibrium' context that the dependency of cost price upon demand-supply can be seen most comprehensively. Cost of production, we have already observed, includes normal profit; the equilibrium price structure will 15 In his Leading Principles (1874, 48-9) J.E. Caimes criticized Mill's inclusion of wages and profits within costs, although that position was 'generally accepted by economists.' Wages and profits, he argued, were not 'costs' in the legitimate sense of that term - namely, 'sacrifices incurred by man in productive industry' - but, on the contrary, they constituted 'the return made by nature to man upon that sacrifice'; 'labour' and 'abstinence' were the true costs of production. Mill (who already had some idea of the nature of the criticism) observed to his friend that both forms were legitimate depending on context - whether it involved the economic system as a whole or the motives of the individual participants in activity: 'the cost to society, as a whole, of any production, consists in the labour and abstinence required for it. But, as concerns individuals and their mutual transactions, wages and profits are the measure of that labour and abstinence, and constitute the motives by which the exchange of commodities against one another is immediately determined' (1972, 1894-5).</page><page sequence="17">602 / Samuel Hollander thus be one that yields the going return on capital in all sectors. Mill described at great length (ibid., 407) the institutional arrangements whereby returns, or expectation of returns, are equalized ('the method of accommodating production to demand') leaving no doubt of the conspicuous role accorded supply variation in the establishment of equilibrium prices, following exactly the lines laid down in Ricardo's Principles. Also in line with Ricardo, Mill used the principles of allocation theory in the rationalization of the inverse wage-profit relation. Thus, in contrast to a wage increase affecting one sector, where price will rise to assure equality of profit rates across the board, there exists no mechanism whereby general prices would be forced upwards in the event of an economy-wide wage increase, when all firms throughout the system are affected equally by the change. From this perspective the fundamental theorem on distribution is founded squarely upon the theory of allocation: a general rise of wages would not raise prices but would be taken out of the profits of the employers; always supposing that those profits were sufficient to bear the reduction. The case is different with a rise of wages confined to a single or a small number of employments. That rise if taken out of profits, would place a particular class of employers at a disadvantage compared with other employers: &amp; as soon as they ceased to hope that the loss would be only temporary, they would withdraw part of their capital, or at all events, all new capital would avoid those trades &amp; go into others. Consequently the supply of these particular articles would fall short, and their prices would rise so as to indemnify the employers for the rise of wages. But this would not happen in case of a rise of all wages, for as all capitalists would be affected nearly alike they could not as a body relieve themselves by turning their capital into another employment. (1972, 1735) Expenses which affect all commodities equally, have no influence on prices. If the maker of broadcloth or cutlery, and nobody else, had to pay higher wages, the price of his commodity would rise, just as it would if he had to employ more labour; because otherwise he would gain less profit than other producers, and nobody would engage in the employment. But if everybody has to pay higher wages, or everybody to employ more labour the loss must be submitted to; as it affects everybody alike, no one can hope to get rid of it by a change of employment, each therefore resigns himself to a diminution of profits and prices remain as they were. In like manner, general low wages, or a general increase in the productiveness of labour, does not make prices low, but profits high. If wages fall, (meaning here by wages the cost of labour), why, on that account, should the producer lower his price? He will be forced, it may be said, by the competition of other capitalists who will crowd into his employment. But other capitalists are also paying lower wages, and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already. (1965, 692) A statement of this position will also be found in the context of Mill's discussion of the nature of costs when focusing upon the distinction between costs from an aggregative and industry perspective. It is indeed precisely in the course of expounding the principles of allocation theory that Mill insisted on the inverse wage-profit relation: 'There is no mode in which capitalists can compensate themselves for a high cost of labour, through any action, on values or prices. It cannot be prevented from taking its place on low profits' (ibid., 479). It is significant, too, that in his correspondence with Cairnes regarding the nature of costs Mill</page><page sequence="18">The French connection in British classicism / 603 immediately saw the implications of the argument for the Ricardian inverse wage-profit relationship: Your discussion of the question whether wages ought in any sense to be considered as cost of production, or whether that term should be exclusively predicated of labour and abstinence, was always likely to be scientifically instructive, but I now perceive that it will have a special value de circonstance. You must have been struck as I have been, by the thoroughly confused and erroneous ideas respecting the relation of wages to prices, which have shewn themselves to be almost universal in the discussions of the recent strikes. The notion that a general rise of wages must produce a general rise of prices, is preached universally .... Certainly no one knows, even imperfectly, what the Ricardo political economy is ... can suppose this to be it. (1972, 1909-10). The appreciation of the equilibrating function of price, the extension of demand-supply analysis from the 'market' to the 'long-run' period involving the process of profit-rate equalization, and the application of these principles to the basic theorem of distribution were all part and parcel of Ricardian analysis. In some respects, doubtless, Mill's formulations constituted an improvement in rigour - particularly the formal statement of an equation of demand and supply and the distinction between displacements of the demand schedules and movements from one position to another on the same schedule (1965, 466). But their merit lies less in substantive content than in their location at a conspicuous juncture among the basic theoretical principles; for Ricardo made many of his statements regarding the theory of allocation in various informal contexts relating to applied problems. No good purpose is served, however, by invidious comparisons regarding 'quality' of analysis. And that is not my concern. The point is simply that Mill's theory of allocation does not constitute a breakaway from Ricardian doctrine, but is a reiteration thereof. 16 * * * I follow the pattern of the previous section by considering Mill's approach to rent. In the aggregate, rent ('the price paid for the use of an appropriated natural agent') differed from the other factor returns in consequence of the conditions of land supply. The agent is 'as indispensable (and even more so) as any implement: but the having to pay a price for it, is not. In the case of the implement (a thing produced by labour) a price of some sort is the necessary condition for its existence: but the land exists by nature. The payment for it, therefore, is not one of the expenses of production ...' (1965, 58). Allowing for differentials complicated the issue only slightly - 'the real expenses of production are those incurred on the worst land, or by the capital 16 It must at the same time be remembered that in introducting his account of the 'equation of demand and supply' Mill did insist upon his own priority, with the exception of J.B. Say, regarding the solution to the 'paradox, of two things, each depending upon the other.' But what we know of Mill's general reaction to Ricardianism suggests that he regarded - and rightly so - this analysis as a clarification of sometimes obscure or ambiguous or incomplete formulations in the original statements of 1817.</page><page sequence="19">604 / Samuel Hollander employed in the least favourable circumstances' (ibid., 429). It should be noted also that Mill, following Ricardo, realized that differential rent entails a special case of scarcity value, and that rent might be generated even in the absence of differentials in the event of an absolute constraint on farm output: 'It is also distinctly a portion of Ricardo's doctrine, that ... the land of a country supposed to be of uniform fertility would, all of it, on a certain supposition, pay rent: namely, if the demand of the community required that it should all be cultivated, and cultivated beyond the point at which a further application of capital begins to be attended with a smaller proportionate return' (ibid., 428). 17 When Mill focused upon individual sectors - and here Mill made explicit what was only implicit in Ricardo - the picture is a very different one: The question ... respecting the influence which the appropriation of natural agents produces on values, is often stated in this form: Does Rent enter into Cost of Production? and the answer of the best political economists is in the negative. The temptation is strong to the adoption of these sweeping expressions, even by those who are aware of the restrictions with which they must be taken; for there is no denying that they stamp a general principle more firmly on the mind, than if they were hedged round in theory with all its practical limitations. But they also puzzle and mislead, and create an impression unfavourable to political economy, as if it disregarded the evidence of facts. No one can deny that rent sometimes entes into cost of production. If I buy or rent a piece of ground, and build a cloth manufactory on it, the ground-rent forms legitimately a part of my expenses of production, which must be repaid by the product. And since all factories are built on ground, and most of them in places where ground is pecularily valuable, the rent for it must, on the average be compensated in the values of all things made in factories. (Ibid., 487). The consequence of multi-use land for cost pricing is laid down clearly in the 'summary of the theory of value'; namely, that 'when land capable of yielding rent in agriculture is applied to some other purpose, the rent which it would have yielded is an element in the cost of production of the commodity which it is employed to produce' (ibid., 498; cf. 484). Consistent with Mill's 'Ricardian' approach to cost price is the Say conception of organization, which emphasizes that the ultimate source of factor remuneration is in sales proceeds and the motive for factor employment in the revenue product. We encounter the relationship in question in reference to 'the present system of industrial life, in which employments are minutely subdivided, and all concerned in production depend for their remuneration on the price of a particular commodity' (ibid., 455). 17 Pertinent, too, is Mill's early defence of the differential-rent theory against the strictures of Senior and others 'who affect to suppose that Sir Edward West, Mr. Malthus, and Mr. Ricardo, considered the cultivation of inferior land as the cause of a high price of corn.' The reverse was the case Mill insisted in 1828: that 'the cultivation of inferior soils' was the effect of high price 'itself the effect of demand' was a doctrine 'explicitly laid down by the distinguished authors previously referred to, and particularly by Mr. Ricardo' (1967, 174) - a perfectly justified defence of the Ricardian position.</page><page sequence="20">The French connection in British classicism / 605 The principle is elaborated in a chapter dealing with indirect inputs of labour in lengthy processes of production: 'All these people ultimately derive the remuneration of their labour from the bread, or its price: the ploughmaker as much as the rest; for since ploughs are of no use except for tilling the soil, no one would make or use ploughs for any other reason than because the increased returns thereby obtained from the ground, afforded a source from which an adequate equivalent could be assigned for the labour of the ploughmaker. If the produce is to be used or consumed in the form of bread, it is from the bread that this equivalent must come' (ibid., 31; it is presumably the expectation of future yield that provides the motive for the use of the input).'8 This perspective completely confounds Jevons's reading of his predecessors. And there is no need to repeat what was said above regarding the fourth proposition on capital; Mill was crystal clear about its intended application to aggregate wages and employment alone (87). Finally, Mill's pronouncements on the wages-fund yield a vision of capitalist organization far removed from one wherein workers consume a distinct class of commodities produced in annual jets - a vision fully in line with that of Ricardo elaborated above (cf. Hollander, 1983). WALRAS'S 'CLASSICAL' COST-PRICE ANALYSIS It is not difficult to show that Walras subscribed to a cost-price analysis of the classical order.19 In fact, it is the so-called 'Marshallian' adjustment mechanism entailing comparisons of demand and supply prices - the Smith-Ricardo-Mill tradition and also formulated so clearly by Say, as we have seen - rather than the so-called 'Walrasian' adjustment mechanism entailing comparisons of demand and supply quantities (pertinent in the simple exchange model) that he adopted in the production context: under free competition, if the selling price of a product exceeds the cost of the productive services for certain firms and a profit results, entrepreneurs will flow towards this branch of production or expand their output, so that the quantity of the product [on the market] will increase, its price will fall, and the difference between price and cost will be reduced; and, if [on the contrary], the cost of the productive services exceeds the selling price for certain firms, so that a loss results, entrepreneurs will leave this branch of production, or curtail their output, so that the quantity of the product [on the market] will decrease, its price will rise and the difference between price and cost will again be reduced. (1954, 225)2 This process involves not merely the transfer of services between sectors without alteration in the supplies of factors from which they derive, although doubtless to some extent this may be involved. For such transfer would be almost instantaneous, whereas Walras emphasized the slowness of adjustment to disturbance. 18 Cf. 32: the labourers producing fixed capital 'do not depend for their remuneration upon the bread made from the produce of a single harvest, but upon that made from the produce of all the harvests which are successively gathered until the plough, or the buildings and fences, are worn out.' 19 I have found Milgate (1979) most helpful. 20 I understand 'profit' as super-normal profit in excess of the normal return earned on capital goods proper; cf. ibid. (267).</page><page sequence="21">606 / Samuel Hollander We consider first remarks made regarding labour that imply the possibility of altering the types of personal capital in response to market pressures, in the long run; that is, upon retraining (or even perhaps with the renewal of the population stock). The case of 'unspecialized productive services' was 'the most frequent case,' Walras conceded to the classics, particularly in the market for labour: Apart from certain individuals naturally gifted with the voice of a great tenor, the limbs of an acrobat, the eye of a painter or the ear of a musician, the great mass of men are capable of performing a wide variety of tasks, just because they are not especially qualified for the performance of any one of them. A man educated to be a lawyer might often just as well have been a manager; and certainly a person trained as a carpenter could have been a locksmith. What do most men inquire into when they come to choose their occupation? Surely, it is the wages they can earn in it, in other words, the value of their productive services in that occupation. The unspecialized productive services, in contradistinction to specific services have competition to fear. (Ibid., 401) Clearly there is a long-run tendency towards wage-rate equalization, contingent upon training and education, very much like that of Adam Smith who, of course, had also minimized innate differences of character and ability. The same conception appears in the famous chapter on the 'Continuous Market,' where we find in effect a more general description of the 'tendency' of market to natural price mediated by credit - an account that would have been at home in any classical text. The emphasis is upon the slowness of adjustment to changes in data - including patterns of final demand and technology - having in mind the differential rates of replacement of circulating capital, personal capital and capital goods proper. But that such a 'tendency' is at work, albeit ever disturbed, is quite clear: Every hour, nay, every minute, portions of [the] different classes of circulating capital are disappearing and reappearing. Personal capital, capital goods proper and money also disappear and reappear, in a similar manner, but much more slowly. Only landed capital escapes this process of renewal. Such is the continuous market, which is perpetually tending towards equilibrium without ever actually attaining it, because the market has no other way of approaching equilibirum except by groping, and, before the goal is reached, it has to renew its efforts and start over again, all the basic data of the problem, e.g. the initial quantities possessed, the utilities of goods and services, the technical coefficients, the excess of income over consumption, the working capital requirements, etc., having changed in the meantime. Viewed in this way, the market is like a lake agitated by the wind, where the water is incessantly seeking its level without ever reaching it. But whereas there are days when the surface of a lake is almost smooth, there never is a day when the effective demand for products and services equals their effective supply and when the selling price of products equals the cost of productive services used in making them. The diversion of productive services from enterprises that are losing money to profitable enterprises takes place in various ways, the most important being through credit operations, but at best these are slow. (Ibid., 380). It will be instructive to consider briefly at this point the formal model itself. A feature of Walras's theory of capital is the determination of the rate of net revenue in terms of the exchange of net savings (incomes exceeding consumption and allowance for depreciation) for new additions to the stock of capital goods, the quantities of the</page><page sequence="22">The French connection in British classicism / 607 different types of capital goods satisfying the condition of equality between their demand and supply prices.21 This condition also reflects the principle of uniformity of net return on the new investments; for if the condition of uniformity 'is not fulfilled with respect to any two capital goods, it will be advantageous to produce less of the capital good for which the ratio is smaller, and more of the capital good for which this ratio is larger' (ibid., 276; cf. ibid., 305). The emphasis is thus upon uniformity of return on new investments; but it would be difficult to appreciate the exclusion of the possibility that a change in the structure of final demand patterns or in technology such as Walras emphasizes, as we have seen, might lower the rentals on certain types of existing capital goods and thus require a contraction in their quantities by the non-investment of available depreciation allowances. In short, the principle of uniformity of the return on capital extends to investment decisions in general - to replacement demand as well as the net demand for new capital goods - although at any particular moment of time it is highly unlikely that uniformity across-the-board will be satisfied in the light of the disturbances in question: 'In an economy like the one we have imagined, which establishes its economic equilibirium ab ovo, it is probable that there would be no equality of rates of net income. Nor would such an equality be likely to exist in an economy which had just been disrupted by a war, a revolution or a business crisis' (ibid., 308). As we concluded, we are dealing only with a tendency to uniformity on capital-in-general. It is clear that equality of net interest is treated by Walras as a 'point of reference' only. It is in the course of adding to and replacing capital goods that decisions are made with an eye on prospective earnings - as we have seen to be the case also in the labour market - but expectations are continually disappointed, so that actual yields diverge from those expected when the investments are undertaken. This was Marshall's position, too; for he maintained that interest is earned on 'free' or 'floating' capital, and the phrase 'rate of interest is applicable to old investments of capital only in a very limited sense'; given complexes earn quasi-rents, and in the polar extreme case of permanent investments the term interest on capital is totally inapplicable (1920, 592-3; also 411-12, 418-19, 533). Nonetheless, the tendency to equalization is continually at play to the extent that complexes do wear out more or less rapidly. Indeed Marshall estimated that as much as 25 per cent of existing capital goods is replaced annually 'even in a country in which the prevailing forms of capital are as durable as in England,' and was prepared for some analytical purposes (particularly in the context of accumulation) to assume 'that the owners of capital in general have been able in the main to adapt its forms to the normal conditions of the time, so as to derive as good a net income from their investments in one way as another' (ibid., 592). 21 'New capital goods are exchanged against the excess of income over consumption; and the condition of equality between the value of the new capital goods and the value of the excess gives us the equation required for the determination of the rate of net income and consequently for the determination of the prices of capital goods. Moreover, new capital goods are products; and the condition of equality between their selling price and their cost of production gives us the equations required for the determination of the quantities manufactured' (ibid., 269--70).</page><page sequence="23">608 / Samuel Hollander This has been termed a 'sort of development of Walrasian theory' - that there is uniformity of the rate of profits on 'free capital,' which points 'not towards long-run equilibrium analysis (in its stationary state, growth theory sense)' but to 'a sort of long-run equilibrium - in its proper sense of new capital gradually and actually flowing towards where quasi-rents have turned out best' (Harcourt, 1975, 351).22 Surely this is the Walras-Marshall line itself? Now I can discern no difference between this line and that of Ricardo. For some analytical purposes Ricardo certainly presumed across-the-board equality of the return on capital. Thus, to investigate the consequences of a change in demand patterns or in technology he would set off from an assumed state of equilibrium in the sense that we 'suppose that all commodities are at their natural price, and consequently that the profits of capital in all employments are exactly at the same rate ...' (1951, I, 90). But he was perfectly well aware, first, that what matters in the (practical) profitability calculations that govern allocation is the return on new investments; for once investments are embodied in an actual capital structure we are dealing with rentals. And secondly that in the polar case of permanent embodiments it is no longer pertinent to talk of a return on capital at all (ibid., 262; See above, 598). Finally, like both Walras and Marshall, Ricardo appreciated that adjustments are never instantaneous even where the 'withdrawal of capital' is physically possible: 'it always becomes a matter of calculation, whether these [capital goods] shall continue to be employed on the land, notwithstanding the low [the unexpectedly low] price of corn, or whether they shall be sold, and their value transferred to another employment' (ibid., 269) - a calculation that is characterized by 'the prejudices and obstinacy with which men persevere in their old employments'; for 'they expect daily a change for the better, and therefore continue to produce commodities for which there is no adequate demand' (1951, vIII, 277). SOME IMPLICATIONS FOR THE 'MARGINAL REVOLUTION' A major implication of the foregoing analysis is that the neo-classical developments of the 1870s involved pre-eminently an altered weighting in the selection of axioms, and in that sense a changed 'focus of attention' as well as a sharpening of analytical tools, but not a paradigmatic displacement. Thus, the principle of marginal utility merely added 'very important explanations' (Marshall, see above, 587) for the negative slope of the demand curve; and the marginal productivity principle added to the better understanding of factor demand in particular uses - elaborations required as much by Say as by Ricardo and Mill. To assert that recognition of a multiplicity of primary factors required a new theory 22 See also Hicks, 1973, 340-1: 'it is quite unnecessary, because we use terms like "capital-intensive" and "rate of profit," to trouble ourselves about the valuation of the capital stock as a whole (as we appeared to have to do in the production function method). What matters is not the average rate of profit on the whole capital stock (which cannot be determined without such valuation); what matters is the rate of profit on new investment. When the new investment is undertaken, that profit is no more than an expected profit, and what is realized may not be the same as what is expected.'</page><page sequence="24">The French connection in British classicism / 609 based upon the principles of demand (Arrow and Starrett, see above, 588) or that classical theory could not solve 'the logical problem of explaining the relative wages of heterogeneous types of labour' (Arrow, cited in Hutchison, 1978, 69) is historically unjustified.23 The wage structure had long been analysed in terms of demand-supply with recognition of a productivity dimension on the demand side; and while value productivity is more conspicuous the more specialized to a particular use individual factors are, those same considerations are no less relevant when allowance is made for factor mobility between uses, although now strict limits are placed on the extent returns in different uses can diverge. In any event, although factor specificity is indeed a neo-classical preoccupation, both Ricardo and Mill carried this very matter far in their generalizations of the rent doctrine. If we take into account the matter of foreign trade and classical analysis in that case - the conspicuous role accorded demand considerations where the mobility axioms are abandoned - it becomes yet clearer that the notion of a paradigmatic transformation in the 1870s is not helpful. And while Mill was largley responsible for the analysis, it must be remembered that Ricardo had left the door open by his formulation (see above, 597-8) so that the elaborations, brilliant as they were, were consistent with existing doctrines. Thus far the neo-classical 'relaxation' of the general (but far from universal) classical assumptions regarding factor mobility between uses. There is also the reverse of the medal to consider - the Ricardian assumption of single-use land. By adopting this assumption Ricardo indicates a preoccupation with the macro dimension; yet the 'class' relationship that concerned him, pre-eminently the inverse wage-profit relationship, could not be understood except in terms of allocation theory. He insisted, as Mill did, upon a micro-foundation for macro-analysis which seems eminently sensible if capitalist- exchange institutions are taken seriously. To trace through the consequences of a variation in the general wage in the case where (marginal) cost price incorporates land rent in the Smith-Say manner would have been technically impossible, given the state of the science. This is also true of J.S. Mill. (It is doubtful whether a specific outcome could be generated in the present day and age, for which reason so much analysis proceeds on the basis of two-factors and two-products.) For all that, the severe problems created for Ricardo's theorem by allowance for multi-use land derive from an analytical model of allocation with which Ricardo himself was familiar. That he did not apply the assumptions of the model universally can be easily appreciated. That there was indeed no paradigmatic displacement is also quite evident from our investigation of Walras. For when he set aside his own restrictive assumption of factor immobility between uses, he was led to formulations of cost-price identical to those of Ricardo and Mill. This theme can be extended. The appropriate axiomatic base depends in part on the 23 It may be agreed that the neo-classics 'took as an expository point of departure a model which was the polar opposite of the classical, the model of pure exchange' (Arrow and Starrett, 1973, 133). Clear exposition may require extreme assumptions, as Ricardo repeatedly insisted.</page><page sequence="25">610 / Samuel Hollander context. The early and later nineteenth-century economists were concerned (as was Adam Smith) with both growth and allocation, although the weighting of their preoccupations certainly differed. Depending upon the context, it was appropriate to emphasize factor 'scarcity' or factor 'reproducibility' or various combinations. Thus Ricardo frequently dealt with disturbances (demand changes, innovation, taxation) within a static framework, although there is no question of his predominant concern with a broad range of analytical issues relating to the growth process - the aggregate factors (capital and labour) treated as variables. And conversely, Walras extended his own analysis in the Elements to the 'Conditions and Consequences of Economic Progress,' which deals with the distributional implications of growth in labour and capital supplies (given land): 'What does need to be discussed ... in view of its extremely weighty consequences, is the fact ... that the quantity of land cannot possibly increase though it is possible to increase the number of persons and the quantity of capital goods proper in an economy that saves and converts its savings into capital' (1954, 382).24 Similarly, he recognized the 'excess of income over consumption in the aggregate' - the matter of surplus and accumulation - as the condition of progress (ibid., 264). Clearly, the classical growth model was not superannuated by the marginalists. J.S. Mill's continued preoccupation with growth issues (and with the general profit rate) despite his sharp awareness of the problem of factor immobility, also requires consideration from this perspective. For it is not obviously true that concern with the general wage and profit rates dissipates with recognition of the phenomenon of non-competing groups. There may yet be disturbances affecting all types of labour more or less equally, and for analysis of the growth process the standard classical mobility axiom (subject to the qualifications made regarding speed of adjustment) may be most appropriate. A NOTE ON SOURCES OF MISINTERPRETATION Professor Samuelson has written of the 'sophisticated-anthropomorphic sin' of not recognizing the equivalent content in older writers, because they did not use the same terminology and symbols as we do (1949, 373). This certainly explains to a large extent the general failure to recognize a key allocative dimension to British classicism. (To some extent this error was invited by Ricardo's sometimes opaque formulations; but since Ricardo was perhaps the first formally to contrast disturbances that have allocative implications and those that exert influence only at the aggregate level, this is scarcely surprising.) 24 Professor Morishima indeed goes so far as to consider this dynamic part as the capstone of the entire general-equilibrium structure (1977), from which perspective he regards the Elements as a whole 'as providing a general-equilibrium foundation for the Ricardian neo-classical macro- economics' (1980, 558). Even W. Jaffe, who denied that part vii was intended as 'an integral part of Walras's general equilibirum edifice,' conceded that Walras's intentions were to show 'how the relations analyzed in the static theory could be used to elucidate such dynamic tendencies as the rise in land-rent, and the fall in the rate of profit in an expanding economy' (1980, 546-7).</page><page sequence="26">The French connection in British classicism / 611 But there is also a matter of theoretical misunderstanding. It is sometimes presumed that since, in Ricardian theory, 'profits are generated in production,' the kind of perspective we have adopted in this paper must be erroneous (Roncaglia, 1981). This is a non sequitur. Ricardo's achievement was to correct Smith's 'adding-up' approach to cost, whereby a change in either wages or profits (or rents) simply generates a corresponding change in general prices: a wage increase must imply reduced profits since the total is constrained in real terms. Nothing that we have said regarding Ricardo's acceptance of J.B. Say's circular flow conception of economic organization with its allowance for final demand controverts this point. For the volume of final demand itself, of course, is governed by the income flow, which in turn is generated in production. REFERENCES Arrow, K.J. and D.A.
