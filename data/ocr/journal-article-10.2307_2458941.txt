<plain_text><page sequence="1">ADVICE TO AUTHORS THE AMERICAN NATURALIST will welcome articles which contribute to the purposes outlined on the inside front cover. Material intended for publication should be prepared to conform to the style in the current issues. It should be typewritten with double spacing, leaving a two inch margin at the right for editorial directions. Each table should be typed on a separate sheet. Footnotes to text statements should be avoided since they can usually be included in the text, parenthetically If necessary. Where unavoidable, they should be numbered consecutively and typed on a separate sheet, since they will be set in a different type size. Footnotes to tables are often necessary; they should be designated by asterisks, daggers and similar signs to avoid confusion with the nu- merals in the tables. Legends for figures should be typewritten on separate sheets. Each article, except letters to the Editors, should contain a brief summary. The "Literature Cited" assumes special importance in articles of the sort which THE AMERICAN NATURALIST hopes to publish. Authors are asked to give for each reference, the author or authors, the year of publica- tion, full title and full citation, without abbreviation, of the joural, the volume number, the beginning and ending pages; or in the case of books, the edition number, the number of pages, and the name and address of the publisher. Current issues can be taken as samples of the style desired. Bibliographies which do not conform to the requirements above will be re- turned to the authors for correction. It is understood that general addresses will often not be accompanied by bibliographies. Reprints will be supplied when ordered at the time of return of proofs, according to the prices quoted on the order form. Reprints of "Letters to the Editors" can be furnished only as reprints of the whole section of "Letters" which may include several. Articles excessive in length or ex- tent of detailed data, but otherwise acceptable to the Editorial Board, may be published as supplements when costs are paid by the authors.</page><page sequence="2">U BOOKS BIRD STUDY By Andrew J.
