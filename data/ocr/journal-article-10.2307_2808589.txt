<plain_text><page sequence="1">w I "I -~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ RECAPITULATION AND ITS SUPPOSED CAUSES BY S. J. HOLMES Department of Zoology, University of California IN TWO preceding issues of this journal there have been reviews of contributions on the so-called biogenetic law, one by Shumway (1932) and a later one by Meyer (1935). In presenting a further treatment of this topic I have avoided traversing the ground covered by these previous reviews and have confined my- self mainly to the discussion of theories of the causes of recapitulation. For this reason the present contribution may be regarded as supple- mentary to the papers mentioned. The very existence of a tendency for ontogeny to recapitulate phylogeny has long been a highly controversial question, and one finds distinguished biologists aligned on both sides of it. No one can deny that there is a general resemblance be- tween the ontogeny and phylogeny of higher organisms simply because they start with a simple cell, an ovum or a one celled ancestor, and end in the same adult individual. Oscar Hertwig (1906) has argued at quite needless length that we cannot compare the ovum of a mammal with a unicellular animal because the former differs enormously from the latter in its complex of developmental factors which are the product of a long process of evolu- tion. This obvious difference was recognized by Haeckel and other proponents of the biogenetic law, and I cannot see that it disposes of the re- capitulation theory, which must stand or fall on the basis of observations in comparative embryol- ogy and morphology. The arguments most relied upon by the recapitulationists are based on simi- larities between ontogeny and phylogeny which are too specific and peculiar in character to be accounted for as simply a consequence of the increasing complexity of the two series, even though they reach a common goal. This is shown by the embryonic history of the gill arches, renal system, the development of the skull and other skeletal structures, the behavior of rudimentary organs, and numerous other facts adduced by the recapitulationists. Such resemblances are quite generally conceded to be explicable only as a con- sequence of origin through evolution. But among the biologists who accept this conclusion we find some who contend that facts such as the history of the gill arches in the embryos of birds and mammals are due to a tendency to recapitulate the adult characters of ancestral forms, while others contend that they are merely develop- mental similarities resulting from a common ancestry. This is the basic issue which has sepa- rated controversialists over the biogenetic law from von Baer to the present. There is resem- blance, according to von Baer (1828-1837), not between an early mammalian embryo and an adult fish but between a mammalian embryo and a fish embryo up to a certain stage. Von Baer strongly criticized the doctrine of recapitulation as set forth by Kielmeyer (1793), Meckel (1821), Oken (1847), and Serres (1824, 1842, 1859), and substituted for it his own well-known law to the effect that embryos belonging to any of the greati groups of animals are at first very much alike and develop along closely similar paths to a degree dependent upon their degrees of affinity. Thus fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals are much alike in their earlier stages, but the fish and mammals diverge first; birds and mammals keep pace longer, and in the mammals man and ape show significant differences only at a relatively later period. Here there is parallelism but not recapitulation. As set forth by von Baer (1828-1837), this law had no evolutionary implications. It was pro- posed as a generalization from observed facts of development, whatever might be its causal ex- planation. Von Baer may have interpreted it in terms of the Naturphilosophie by which he was strongly influenced, especially in his early years, partly perhaps owing to his teacher Diillinger who was an adherent of this school. In his post- Darwinian period, von Baer (1864-1876) con- tinued his attack on the doctrine of recapitulation, but since he never committed himself to more 319</page><page sequence="2">320 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY than a guarded and limited advocacy of the genetic derivation of species, he did not accept the evolu- tionary explanation of his law that came to be so widely adopted by the followers of Darwin. The pre-Darwinian exponents of the doctrine of recapitulation developed no very plausible explanation as to why recapitulation occurs. The doctrine that ontogeny summarizes phylogeny obviously implies that organisms have a phylogeny. But one who attempts to trace its early history is sometimes perplexed by the uncertainty as to whether or not certain writers regarded the forms of life as constituting a genetically connected series. The phraseology of several authors is very indefinite on this subject and has undoubtedly misled a number of writers who have treated of the history of evolutionary thought, especially mrnst Haeckel and Henry Fairfield Osborn. This phraseology is all the more confusing because of the employment of "evolution" in different senses and because of the reiterated statement that organisms form a closely graded series from the simplest to the most complex and exhibit in their organization a strict conformity to unity of type. The idea that plants and animals can be ar- ranged in a single series was very prevalent up to the time of Cuvier and Lamarck and was adopted by both creationists and evolutionists, as well as by some who do not appear to fall within either category. It was apparently looked upon favor- ably by Kant; it fitted very neatly into the specu- lative set-up of Leibnitz, and it was explicitly defended by Herder, Schelling, Bonnet, and others, but by'none of these writers was it given a true evolutionary interpretation. The doctrine that higher organisms in their embryonic development pass through the various stages of the taxonomic series was set forth by creationists, such as Agassiz, and by evolutionists, such as Meckel (1821) and Serres (1824, 1842, 1859), and by some naturalists, such as Oken (1847), who held to the de novo origination of organisms out of primitive Ursch- leim which arose from the purely material ele- ments of sea water under the influence of light. By many naturalists and philosophers the pro- duction of organisms de novo was looked upon as a natural and orderly procedure like the growth of a plant from a seed. This attitude was es- pecially characteristic of the participants of that peculiar movement known as Naturphilosophie which attained a luxuriant growth in Germany in the closing years of the eighteenth and first few decades of the nineteenth century. Although Kant and Leibnitz must be reckoned among its forerunners, this Naturphilosophie was mainly an outgrowth of idealistic philosophy of the period' from Fichte to Hegel. Its leading exponent was Schelling, who essayed the task of elaborating a philosophy of nature on the basis of his tran- scendental idealism. Nature, being the product of reason, was regarded as rigidly orderly and and rational throughout. Schelling (1857, 1858) held that all nature is an organism in which forms show a graded series from matter to man with no gap between the inorganic and organic,-the whole having been produced in accordance with definite laws. Nevertheless, he expressly denied that any one species is ever derived from any other one. Presumably, therefore, they must have arisen de novo by a natural process of spon- taneous generation. Perhaps a similar view must be attributed to Hegel (1829), who held that evo- lution does not occur in nature in any other sense than that of a purely logical development of concepts. Possibly also it must be attributed to Goethe, despite his emphasis on unity of type and his ridicule of the anthropomorphic notions of creation prevailing in his time. It certainly must be attributed to Robinet (1761, 1768), who held that nature succeeded in creating man only after a series of independent spurts, each of which brought her nearer to her goal. And it was also held by Oken, who perhaps represented the vagar- ies of Naturphilosophie at its worst. This is evident from his remarks on the origin of man (1847), in which he tells us that man, like the lower animals "is a child of the warm and shallow parts of the sea in the neighborhood of the land," and that "It is even possible that only one fa- vorable moment was granted in which men could arise. A definite mixture of water, definite heat of blood, and definite influence of light must con- cur to his production." Oken's speculations on the origin of man appear to have been regarded with favor by Carl Gustav Carus (see his Grundziige der vergleichenden Anatomie und Physiologie, Dresden, 1828). Even the cautious and critical von Baer, who inveighed vigorously against ap- peals to miraculous creations, vacillated to the end of his days between the origin of distinct types through descent with modification and some form of de novo origination in accordance with natural laws (see his Reden, ed. 2., pp. 56, 57, 245, 252, 381-383). A further treatment of this topic, entitled "Von Baer's Perplexities over Evolution", will appear in Isis.</page><page sequence="3">RECAPITULA TION 321 Oken (1847) has stated very definitely that the embryos of higher animals pass through stages represented by adult animals lower in the scale, but he can hardly be called a recapitulationist because he was not an evolutionist. Like others who held similar views, he could not give anything but a mystical interpretation of the parallelism between embryonic stages and the taxonomic series. An earlier formulation of this parallelism had been made by Kielmeyer, who was held in high esteem as a teacher and thinker. A few devoted spirits have represented him as a tower- ing genius ranking among the most eminent sci- entists of the nineteenth century. In a paper (1793) which is almost his only published utter- ance he makes the following statement: "Since the distribution of powers in the series of organ- isms follows the same order as their distribution in the developmental conditions of the same indi- viduals, it can be inferred that the power through which the production of the latter occurs, namely the reproductive power, agrees in its laws with the power through which the series of different or- ganisms of the earth were called into being." In other words, the production of the embryonic and taxonomic series is to be referred to the same causes. Here we have perhaps the first statement of the doctrine of recapitulation and the first suggestion as to its causes. Kielineyer treats of development not as a series of structural changes but as a suc- cession of forces or powers. He apparently looks upon the species of organisms as forming a geneti- cally connected series, although his indefinite phraseology is not entirely convincing on this point. The doctrine of recapitulation was set forth much more explicitly by Meckel (1821) and most copiously by Serres. According to Serres (1842), "The animal series repeats the embryological series and the one is the reproduction of the other in such a way that the embryos exhibit temporarily the characters which the animals possess per- manently ... human organology is a transitory comparative anatomy as in turn comparative anatomy is the fixed and permanent state of the organization of man." According to Serres the appearance of recapitulation is brought about by arresting development at various periods. One might say that there is but one developmental tendency-that of producing man,-and that all inferior creatures are embryos halted on the way. In other words, animals below man represent merely a lot of human abortions occurring at different developmental stages. Both Meckel and Serres adhered to a uniserial classification of animals and were thereby led, like Geoffrey St. Hilaire, into making a number of absurd homol- ogies and also, like Oken, into drawing fanciful conclusions concerning the relations of onto- genetic stages to particular taxonomic groups. Recapitulation, as expounded by its adherents, was intimately tied up with a lot of ill-grounded speculations that made the devastating criticisms by von Baer an easy task. A number of early writers on embryology were affected by the spirit of the Naturphilosophie which led them to seek for comprehensive unifying ideas in their interpre- tations of nature. The Naturphilosophie, despite the extravagancies of a priori speculation which finally brought it into discredit, led its votaries to seek for principles of law and order in natural phenomena and may, therefore, have exercised a stimulating influence upon the development of comparative anatomy. It encouraged the search for homologies and unity of type which were often interpreted idealistically as in the writings of Goethe, Carus, Oken, and Richard Owen. The parallelism between the ontogenic and the tax- onomic series was held to manifest some underlying creative principle which in some way not clearly understood is responsible for this relationship. Up to the middle of the nineteenth century one meets with little except mystical notions on the relationship between embryology and taxonomy. Among those who opposed appeals to miraculous creations, notions concerning the origin of living types were as a rule very vague. Belief in spon- taneous generation was quite general, and it was an open question as to how far highly organized types might arise in this way. If rotifers and worms could develop out of non-living material, why not fishes and frogs, or even man? The proponents of the Naturphilosophie looked upon the phenomena of nature as directed by forces ranging from those working in a purely mechan- ical fashion, like gravity, to those manifesting purposive and intelligent guidance. If purpose controls the development of the embryo, as main- tained by von Baer and many others, why may it not effect the de novo origination of a highly organized animal as well as an infusorian? The mysterious powers giving rise to the phenomena of life were held to follow definite laws, and if the succession of living forms is guided by purpose, as was generally assumed, the embryonic develop- ment of higher types might be expected to show similarities with the successive creative stages</page><page sequence="4">322 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY manifested by lower forms. The resemblance of ontogeny to the ascending series of types might thus occur whether the latter were considered as a genetically connected series, as held by Meckel, Serres, and probably Kielmeyer, or as new forma- tions, as held by Schelling, Oken, and other adherents of the Naturphilosophie. I shall call attention to only one other pre- Darwinian writer who has touched upon our theme. This is the much abused author of the Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (1844). Robert Chambers, to whom the authorship of this originally anonymous book is now attributed, was not only violently attacked in theological quarters, but he was at times referred to in slighting if not contemptuous terms by some of the followers of Darwin. "In the reproduction of the higher animals," he tells us, "the new being passes through stages in which it is successively fish-like and reptile-like. But the resemblance is not to the adult fish or the adult reptile, but to the fish and reptile at a certain point in their foetal progress." Chambers had arrived at a more rational conception of recapitulation than had been held by any of his predecessors. How far he may have been influenced by von Baer is uncertain, since he makes no references to this author. He gives several illustrations of the de- velopmental similarities exemplified in von Baer's law, but at the same time he is quite explicit as to the occurrence of recapitulation. His notions of the causes of recapitulation are less satisfactory, but they fit into his general idea of the successive origination of species. "The production of new forms," he states, "has never been anything more than a new stage of progress in gestation." In each stage in the whole advance of life, "we have to trace the effect of an Almighty Will which had arranged the whole in suclh harmony with external physical circumstances, that both were devel- oped in parallel steps." Progressive evolution is attributed to a developmental power working under divine guidance and producing advanced stages by prolonging gestation when the power operates with greater energy, and leading to monstrosities when reduced in energy. Recapit- ulation is regarded as a manifestation of develop- mental arrests, much as it was by Serres. Evo- lution, according to Chambers, is merely an orderly creation, and phylogeny and ontogeny are more or less alike because the same creative forces operate in both. In passing from the speculative vagaries of the Romantic Period and from much that is naive and absurd in the Vestiges to the discussion of embryology by Darwin in the Origin of Species, one becomes translated to a different intellectual world. Darwin was concerned with embryology chiefly as affording support to his doctrine of descent. In the first edition of the Origin of Species he makes no reference to von Baer, al- though he dwells upon the fact that animals commonly resemble one another much more closely in their earlier than in their later stages of development. At this time he may have been unacquainted with the Entwicklungsgeschichte der Tiere, since his illustrations of these early re- semblances were drawn from fields with which he was very familiar-the larvae of cirripeds, the breeds of pigeons, and the young of domestic animals. In later editions he refers to the evi- dence adduced by von Baer and quotes one of the latter's questionable statements relating to two early embryos in his possession, concerning which he was "quite unable to say to what class they belonged. They may be lizards, or small birds or very young mammals, so complete is the simi- larity in the mode of formation of the head and trunk in these animals." Darwin makes effec- tive use of embryological resemblances as indi- cating genetic relationships, but he goes further and attempts to explain why, in general, although not without exceptions, early embryos are more nearly alike than later ones. The interpretation he offers applies also to recapitulation where this phenomenon appears. His explanation makes a striking advance over those of his predecessors, as we no longer have an appeal to mysterious formative forces but to recognized facts of heredity and the operation of natural selection. This is clearly exemplified in the following passage quoted from the first edition of the Origin of Species (1859): "As the embryonic state of each species and group of species partially shows us the structure of its less modified ancient progenitor, we can clearly see why ancient and extinct forms of life should resemble the embryos of their descendants,- our existing species. Agassiz believes this to be a law of nature; but I am bound to confess that I only hope to see the law hereafter proved true. It can be proved true in those cases alone in which the ancient state, now supposed to be represented in many embryos, has not been obliterated either by the successive variations in a long course of modification having supervened at a very early stage, or by the variations having been inherited</page><page sequence="5">RECAPITULA TION 323 at an earlier period than that at which they first appeared.... "Thus, as it seems to me, the leading facts of embryology, which are second to none in impor- tance in natural history, are explained on the principle of slight modifications not appearing in the many descendants from some one ancient progenitor at a very early period in the life of each, though perhaps caused at the earliest, and being inherited at a corresponding not very early period." In the sixth edition of the Origin of Species (1872), when discussing how recapitulation may be brought about, Darwin brings out a very impor- tant fact in the following passage: "The question is not, at what period of life each variation may have been caused, but at what period the effects are displayed. The cause may have acted, and I believe often has acted, on one or both parents before the act of generation. It deserves notice that it is of no importance to a very young animal, as long as it remains in its mother's womb or in the egg, or as long as it is nourished and protected by its parent, whether most of its characters are acquired a little earlier or later in life. It would not signify, for instance, to a bird which obtains its food by having a much-curved beak whether or not whilst young it possessed a beak of this shape so long as it was fed by its parents." In discussing the facts and conclusions set forth by Muller, Darwin subscribes to the conclusion that since crustaceans belong to such distinct groups as phyllopods, cirripeds, schizopods, and even some primitive decapods, such as Penaeus, pass through a nauplius stage, "it is probable that at some very remote period an independent adult animal, resembling the nauplius, existed, and subsequently produced, along several divergent lines of descent, the above-named great Crusta- cean groups." But Darwin hastens to explain that recapitulation is not a universal law. "The law will not strictly hold good in those cases in which an ancient form became adapted in its larval state to some special line of life, and trans- mitted the same larval state to a whole group of descendants; for such larvae will not resemble any still more ancient form in its adult state." It is clear that Darwin regarded embryonic his- tory as recapitulating in a general way the course of phylogeny. His explanation of the causes of recapitulation involves ideas which have been adopted by two verydifferent groups, theLamarck- ians and the neo-Darwinians. Characters ac- quired through use or disuse might tend to be inherited at earlier and earlier periods and thus give rise to recapitulation, and characters de- veloped through natural selection in the later stages of life might behave in the same way and produce a similar effect. The essential features of the principle of acceleration, concerning which he later had some correspondence with. Professor Alpheus Hyatt, had already been set forth in the first edition of the Origin of Species, but Darwin explained this only in part as a consequence of the inheritance of acquired characters. It is evident that he regarded it mainly as a result of natural selection in accumulating those variations that became manifest in the later stages of on- togeny. In most accounts of the doctrine of recapitula- tion scant justice is given to Darwin's masterly treatment of the subject at a time when virtually nothing but ill-founded speculations on it had been made. In striking contrast to some of his predecessors he did not give free rein to his fancy, but tested the generalizations of von Baer by actual measurements on the young and adults of several species, carefully scrutinized his data for non-conformable facts, and came to conclusions, both as to why recapitulation sometimes occurs and also why it sometimes does not, which have anticipated a number of later hypotheses based on a much greater wealth of knowledge. His treatment makes a great advance over previous discussions of recapitulation in soundness of judg- ment, grasp of the subject in its varied bearings, and in resourcefulness in devising explanations of the phenomena in terms of heredity and selection. I need not dwell upon the valuable contributions of Fritz Muller on the evolutionary bearings of development and metamorphosis, but I cannot forbear commenting briefly upon some of the specu- lations of Haeckel on the causes of his so-calied biogenetic law. Haeckel is of course well known as the high priest of this doctrine. For a time the biogenetic law was widely accepted as a mat- ter of course, under a rather vague idea that if evolution occurred recapitulation would somehow follow. Haeckel was very influential in populariz- ing this conviction. He was a forceful expositor, enthusiastic, endowed with boundless energy, positive, uncritical, dogmatic, intolerant, a hard fighter who wielded a bludgeon, instead of a rapier like Huxley, and he was indefatigable in preaching his gospel through many books and articles in much the same strain for over forty years. With his crude materialistic and so-called</page><page sequence="6">324 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY monistic philosophy, he swayed the thinking of thousands of his fellow countrymen. But, al- though at times he laid himself open to criticisms that did not add to his glory, his scientific activities greatly stimulated the pursuit of knowledge in the fields of comparative embryology and morphol- ogy. Looking upon recapitulation as something that necessarily follows from the fact of evolution, Haeckel is naturally led to attempt a causal- ex- planation of this relationship. Recapitulation, he assures us, "is simply a consequence of hereditv." "The ontogeny," he says, "as a series of form changes which each individual otganism passes through in the entire term of its individual exist- ence is immediately determined through the phylogeny, or the development of the organic phylum to which it belongs." (1866, Bd. 2. p. 300.) This sentence expresses a now old fashioned conception of heredity as the derivation of an organism's characteristics from the corresponding characteristics of its parents, a process which is still implied in theories of Lamarckian inheritance. As might be inferred, Haeckel believed in the transmission of acquired characters, and hence he believed that ontogenies could be molded through accumulating modifications contributed by an- cestors, but his attempt at a mechanistic explana- tion of such transmission, embodied in a paper (1876) bearing the rather pedantic title of "Peri- genesis of the Plastidule," is a fanciful production of little scientific value. Some form of Lamarckian theory, though form- erly more than now, has commonly been adopted by the adherents of the biogenetic law whenever they attempted to explain why ontogeny recapitu- lates phylogeny. The effects of experiences were commonly held to be inherited at the stage in which they were acquired, and since a large part of them occur after development has been com- pleted, they were supposed to crowd previously acquired characters into earlier and earlier periods. This tendency which Hyatt (1889) and Cope (1904) called the Law of Acceleration naturally brings about a repetition of ancestral history in the development of the individual. The hypothe- sis of acceleration seemed to be supported by the studies of Wiirtenberger (1880), NVaagen (1869), Hyatt (1889, 1893), and later investigators on ammonites, and those of Beecher (1901) on brachi- opods, and by other investigators in different groups. It is stated by Cope (1904) that where there is progressive evolution, "characters ac- quired during the phylogeny are continually assumed by the progressive form at earlier and earlier periods of life." They thus crowd back still earlier characters and may eliminate them entirely. Progressive evolution is thus conceived to occur through successive additions at or near the end of ontogeny, and hence the embryonic development of the organism preserves a modified but more or less faithful record of its phylogeny. This interpretation has been widely adopted by the theorists who would explain recapitulation in Lamarckian terms. Most of these theories, but not all of them, endeavor to construe heredity as analogous to memory. This idea first gained prominence through the well known essay of Hering on Memory as a General Function of Or- ganic Matter, published in 1870. In this essay it is contended that there is a fundamental affinity between conscious memory, habit formation, and heredity. All are forms of reproduction. Acts performed once are in general performed more readily and in much the same way on subsequent occasions. Each repetition registers a modifi- cation of the organic substance which is at the same time the physical ground of memory, habit and the transmission of acquired characters. This is the gist of the numerous memory theories put forward by Lamarckians. They have been de- veloped in various forms by Erlsberg, Haeckel, His, Samuel Butler (1877, 1880, 1887), Cope (1904), Orr, Pauly, Haacke, Mantia, Semon (1904), Rignano, Francis Darwin, and James Ward. As active formative agents in transmitting the effects of experiences one finds that appeals to vibrations, or wave motions, figure about as promi- nently in these theories as in writings on occult forces. The memory theories, based as they are upon a very loose and general analogy, are rather baffling to critics because they leave so few oppor- tunities to come to close grips with the problem. When one tries to picture their application in any specific case one is simply lost. It is only when conceived in a vague and nebulous fashion that they have any degree of plausibility. We shall leave them therefore for more tangible subjects. The eailier pre-Darwinians who accepted the doctrine of recapitulation did so as a rule without making any effort to explain it. Weismann, as might be expected from so consequent a thinker, is one of the exceptions to this rule and he carried on an extensive series of observations on the color markings of caterpillars in the endeavor to ob- tain evidence bearing on the problem. His find-</page><page sequence="7">RECAPITULA TION 325 ings (1904) led him to conclude that new changes came chiefly toward the end of ontogeny and tend to crowd back the earlier stages. The study is therefore analogous to those carried on with am- monites by Wiirtenberger (1880), Waagen (1869), and Hyatt (1889, 1893, 1894), and results in simi- lar conclusions as to acceleration, but without assuming Lamarckian inheritance. New char- acters, he contends, are adaptive and hence due to natural selection, but being based on the old, they tend to push back the old to earlier periods of life. From the Weismannian standpoint it is evident that there is nothing inevitable about recapitulation. Weismann admits this. Never- theless he holds that there is a tendency for char- acters to be shunted' back, and that "It is certainly not natural selection which effects the shunting back." He concludes that "there must therefore be some mechanical factor in development to which is due the fact that characters acquired in the later stage are gradually transferred to the younger stages (1904, p. 185)." Unfortunately he gives us no clue as to what this mechanical factor may be. Since a large part of the controversy over the biogenetic law has concerned the question of re- capitulation vs. parallelism, any treatment of theories as to the causal factors involved must con- sider what recapitulation implies. The followers of Haeckel, like his forerunners Meckel and Serres, held that embryonic stages resemble the series of adult ancestors. Haeckel (1866) conceived that this resemblance is less exact than it was held to to be by his predecessors, especially Serres, owing to different degrees of coenogenetic modification. If it were not for these modifications ontogeny, he contended, would be a fairly reliable record of ancestral history, but this record is "falsified" in varying degrees in different types. When recapitulation is interpreted in this sense, its existence is emphatically denied by a large and perhaps increasing number of biologists. Others give the biogenetic law a different interpretatiQn by saying that the stages recapitulated are more embryonic than adult. One might reasonably hold that through the pushing back process struc- tural additions are more or less modified and es- pecially simplified in adaptation to other develop- mental processes. Whether a structure persists, becomes reduced, eliminated, modified in char- acter, or even increased, doubtless depends in part upon its role in the general physiology of the developing organism. The studies of Oppel (1891), Keibel (1898), Mehnert (1897, 1898), and others have shown that there has been much shift- ing in the time order of appearance of structures, or heterochrony, in the embryonic development of vertebrate animals,-a fact that led Mehnert and others to conclude that the doctrine of recapit- ulation should be applied to single organs instead of embryos as wholes. A structure may be repeated in subsequent embryos in a form approaching its adult condi- tion, if it plays an important role in the formation of other organs, even if its final development should become reduced because it is no longer useful or is even injurious in the mature individual. A study of comparative embryology shows that there is much variation in the tendency of organs lost in the adult to persist in the embryo. Struc- tures recently lost sometimes leave no trace in the development of the embryo, while long-lost organs, such as the notochord in adult mammals, show a remarkable degree of persistence in the development of every individual. The noto- chord forms a stage in the development of the vertebral column in all higher vertebrates, andthis structure, which is more or less similar to its adult condition in primitive chordate types, has not improbably been retained on this account. But it also plays an important role in the differentiation of the nerve cells of the spinal cord through its probably secondarily evolved function as an organizer. For this reason it might possibly have persisted even if the vertebral column had disap- peared in the course of evolution. The retention of gill pouches and gill arches in the embryos of higher vertebrates has long been cited as evidence of recapitulation. The oppo- nents of this doctrine could say that this fact simply shows a parallel development of fis4 and the higher vertebrates in early stages. The long persistence of these structures, when so many other fish-like characters have disappeared, is com- monly explained on the theory that they form necessary stages in the development of permanent organs of the higher vertebrates. The Eustachian tube in man, for instance, arises from an anterior gill slit which is phylogenetically the older organ. It is claimed that if the tube continues to be formed the gill slit must continue to be formed or else some other de novo method must be- substi- tuted. This is no easy task, although similar feats have at times been accomplished. By far the easier method is to lug along the old precursory procedures. In many ways an appearance of</page><page sequence="8">326 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY recapitulation results from conservatism in the methodology of organ formation. Although an embryo as a whole would not closely resemble any ancient progenitor, one can- not assert that the same statement necessarily applies to a particular organ. There might be recapitulation of certain ancestral structures or even of a limited succession of them, but even where long lost parts are retained on account of their physiological importance in embryogeny, they usually become greatly modified in course of time. This may be partly owing to the influence of other parts, to changes in the hereditary factors that cooperate in their production, or again to taking on new developmental functions as in the case of several of the endocrine glands. Doubtless the assumption of endocrine activity has saved many an organ from extinction. One might expect, therefore, that the extent to which embryonic organs are palingenetic would be exceedingly varied. By the proper selection of cases one might build up an impressive array of evidences for the theory of recapitulation. This would not prove that ontogeny is largely determined by phylogeny, in the way supposed by Haeckel. Old adult structures may be quickly lost or retained for an apparently unreasonable length of time, depending on circumstances affecting their functional im- portance in development. There can be no doubt that the critics of the biogenetic law as formulated by Haeckel are right in many of their contentions. Embryos of higher forms do not closely resemble the adult stages of the series of progenitors. But the critics often attempt to dispose of the doctrine of recapitulation too simply, by saying that all the similarities in question are due to the fact that one ontogeny resembles another owing to a common heredity. Garstang (1922), for instance, in an attempt at a critical restatement of the bio- genetic law states that "The phyletic succession of adults is the product of successive ontogenies. Ontogeny does not recapitulate phylogeny; it creates it. There is a general correspondence between the successive grades of differentiation in ontogeny and the successive types of organiza- tion which characterize the steps of the phyletic progress. This general correspondence exists because each series-the ontogenic and the phylogenic-was preceded by the same phyletic series of ontogenies. The outcome of each suc- cessive series was an adult representative of one of the successive types of organization. The last ontogeny of the whole series is the one under con- sideration. Inevitably there is recapitulation of successive grades of differentiation, but repetition of adult ancestral stages is necessarily and entirely lacking." If the term ancestral stages is applied to organ- isms as wholes the last statement is largely true. Let us suppose, however, that a species of insect, B, differs from A in having five more joints in its antennae and that each increase has occurred at a later stage in development than the previous one by a division of the terminal joint. Each onto- genic stage of B would correspond to a phylogenic stage in the transition from A to B. If one considers individual organs it does not follow, there- fore, that "the repetition of adult stages is neces- sarily and entirely lacking." For reasons previ- ously mentioned it may happen that on account of its physiological relations a structure fairly close to its state in an adult ancestor may be re- tained in the embryological development of its descendants. There is, of course, resemblance between the ontogenies of successive forms, but this does not preclude resemblance in varying degrees of closeness between ontogenic and adult phylogenic structures. Where this occurs one may regard it as a case of recapitulation in the literal sense of this term. The more recent discussions of the causes of recapitulation have usually been carried on from the neo-Darwinian standpoint. Naef (1917) has put forward what he calls "the law of terminal modification," which he states as follows: "The stages are conservative in proportion as they ap- pear earlier, and progressive in proportion as they appear later in the ontogenetic series." In his Lieferung on Phylogenie der Tiere, Naef (1931) lays down the following principle: "Morphogenetic processes of an ontogenetic stage through whose modification a following stage arises are to be looked upon as phylogenetically older than those which grew out of them." Prolongation of the development with additions at late stages would give rise to recapitulation, whereas a shortening of the process would effect the loss of end stages and simplification of structure. The tendency to develop additional structures at or near the end of ontogeny has been especially emphasized by Sewertzoff (1931), who has ad- duced much factual evidence in support of his conclusions. He recognized, however, as in fact others have done, that evolution does not always take place by additions in the later stages of the embryonic series. He distinguishes three types of</page><page sequence="9">RECAPITULATION 327 ontogenic change, according as they occur at the beginning, middle, or terminal period of develop- ment. These three modes Sewertzoff attempts to show are correlated with different types of phylo- geny. Where additions are made to the end stages leading to a progressive modification, the final stage of the ancestral forms is retained and thus repeated in the Haeckelian sense. The terminal stages, Sewertzoff holds, are modified slowly by accumulating small variations. Where changes occur in the middle period there may be recapitulation up to that point also, but when they occur near the beginning there is no recapitulation, and the change is likely to produce an abrupt and extensive modification. Sewertzoff concludes that "The law of recapitulation and von Baer's law are not universally valid; they are entirely valid only for organs which have developed by means of additions to end stages" (p. 366). I am not able to do justice to the contributions which the re- searches of Sewertzoff have made to our problems. They constitute the most significant factual addi- tions to our knowledge in this field in recent decades. They show that the relations of ontog- eny and phylogeny cannot be expressed in terms of one general principle. The relationships in- volved are contingent, however widespread may be their occurrence. The writers thus far considered have viewed the problem of recapitulation chiefly from the stand- point of comparative anatomy, embryology, and paleontology. The reasons for recapitulation or parallelism were sought first of all in the con- servatism of heredity, terminal acquisition, and the pushing back of characters in ontogeny; and modifications were attributed to retardation, heterochrony, suppression, and the appearance of variations at different periods. In a few recent contributions the problem has been treated from the standpoint of modern genetics. A geneticist naturally looks upon phylogeny as a succession of ontogenies which owe their hereditary differences to variations in the genes with which they start. The stream of germ plasm gives rise to both ontog- eny and phylogeny and to whatever relationships may subsist between them. All evolution in or- ganisms is simply the manifestation of the one basic evolution of the Keimbahn, or continuous germ plasm. The developmental factors carried by the germ plasm affect ontogeny at different stages. Some genes may lie latent because con- ditions necessary for theix activity are not fur- nished until a certain stage is reached. If we regard genes as catalytic agents, the conditions for their manifestation may be supplied by cer- tain substances produced by other genes. A regu- lar sequence of morphogenetic gene activities may be determined in this way. In his latest book, The Material Basis of Evolu- tion, Goldschmidt (1940) has applied his theory of gene action developed in his Physiologische Theorie der Vererbung (1927) to the interpretation of recapitulation as follows: "If macroevolutionary changes proceed by mutations affecting the rate of embryogenetic processes at a definite time in development, the ontogeny of all descendants of the mutant form must continue along ancestral lines up to the stage in development first affected by the mutant.... The presence of recapitulation shows positively that the original mutational change in the ancestors affected development after the stage which is recapitulated." (p. 389) The influence of gene mutation in the course of development would therefore depend largely on when the mutant genes begin to function. Early activity, by modifying subsequent changes, would tend to obliterate the ancestral record. Hence recapitulation would be evident in proportion as gene mutations become active toward the end of ontogeny. One is naturally led to ask, therefore, whether mutations are unusually prone to appear at this time, and if so, why. One very simple reason for their late manifestation is because such changes are not easily recognized in early periods. A germinal change affecting a blastula or gastrula is very likely to be overlooked. A mutant gene that would give rise to a club foot, for instance, would probably not produce a noticeable effect before the fomation of limb buds even if it were active very early. As embryos grow more com- plex, the chances for a mutant gene to produce a recognizable effect would be greatly multiplied. Hence a certain tendency of new characters to appear in the later stages of development is thus merely a statistical consequence of increasing complexity. But aside from this simple circumstance, which affects appearances only, there is the fact that with increasing differentiation, there are more oppor- tunities for slumbering genes to find conditions suitable for their activities. Many genes are forced to lie dormant because no material is yet available upon which they can act. Late embryos present a remarkable amount of chemical differ- entiation in their several regions. In higher or- ganisms there are many different kind of genes,</page><page sequence="10">328 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY and one furnishes the soil in which another can operate. Moreover, gene mutations have to fit into the ontogeny without too greatly disrupting its course. If they manifest themselves toward the end of it, when there are few or no further processes to be thrown out of gear, they would not be so likely to be eliminated by natural selection. Both Goldschmidt and Sewertzoff have contended that gene mutations that act early are likely to produce extensive changes in ontogeny. In 1913 Wilhelm Roux had expressed a similar idea, in that "for the most part only such new variations of the germ plasm accumulate in phylogeny which first are developed toward the end of ontogeny." Our present knowledge of lethal mutations clearly indicates that the fatality of gene expression in very early development is exceedingly high. How much of this mortality is attributable to the nature of the mutations and how much to the period in which they act we do not know. A priori, it seems probable that the earlier the change, and therefore the greater the subsequent modifications en- tailed, the less likely it would prove to be advan- tageous. Early stages would seem therefore to be especially guarded against change. They do change, but the directions of adaptive modifica- tions are relatively limited, if they do not prove injurious to the subsequent ontogeny. Another cause of the appearance of recapitula- tion is found in the relation of bodily size to the relative growth of parts. In many organisms it has been found that the ratio of the growth of parts to the growth of the whole remains fairly constant for a considerable time. As some or- gans grow more rapidly than others, the different growth ratios lead to definite changes of form. Much of the data on this subject has been amassed by Julian Huxley in his Problems in Relative Growth (1932). The horns of deer grow relatively faster than other parts, and develop more prongs with increasing age. Paleontological data show a parallel evolution from older and smaller species to larger recent types with relatively larger -and more branched antlers. This parallel between the ontogenic and the probable phylogenic develop- ment of horns in deer has often been cited in the books as an illustration of recapitulation. In one sense it is, but the causes of it probably lie in the physiological and genetic factors that lead to dif- ferential rates of growth and development. These rates may be expressed in a mathematical formula y = bxk where y = volume of part, x = volume of whole, and b and k are constants. This formula has been found in many investigations to fit quite closely the measurements taken at different stages. Constant differential growth rates often lead to excessive developments as size increases, and furnish many of the evidences adduced in favor of orthogenesis. An interesting case is furnished by the evolution of the extinct ti- tanotheres, in which Osborn (1929) has shown that there has been a parallel evolution of horns from mere stubs to large horns in four independent lines. Hersh (1934) has investigated these types and finds that the relative growth rates of the horns conform to the formula mentioned, with the same constants b and k for each series, but that these constants differ from one series to another. Thus the alleged orthogenesis of these forms is probably an expression of different developmental rates which go along with increase of size. There are, therefore, several reasons for the accumulation of gene manifestations in late ontogeny and hence the appearance of recapitula- tion. Nevertheless, the doctrine of recapitulation cannot lay claim to being a law. Nor does it express a nearly universal tendency. What is acquired late in phylogeny may appear early in ontogeny, as is shown by the early manifestations of many new mutations, and what is acquired early in phylogeny, like metamerism in the mam- malian embryo, may arise later than the folds of the amnion which are phylogenetically a much more recent development. The particular rela- tions of ontogeny and phylogeny are subject to extensive changes. The several causes that bring about an appearance of recapitulation are quite different in their nature and different again from those that effect the direction of evolution. A number of critics have pointed out that the Haeckelian distinction between palingenic and coenogenic characters is not valid. Both depend upon germinal mutations, presumably accumu- lated on account of their adaptive value. A coenogenic character in a larval or embryonic stage is just as indicative of a similar character in ancestry as is any character of the adult. Each stage has its phylogeny, in relation to which its hereditary characters may be palingenic. Another objection to the theory of recapitula- tion that deserves more attention is the claim that phylogeny cannot in any sense be the cause of ontogeny, as was claimed by Haeckel. Modifi- cations of ontogeny, it is asserted, cause phylog- eny, and not the reverse. But the term phylog- eny was originally applied to a genetically</page><page sequence="11">RECAPITULATION 329 connected series of adult stages. It is a historical series, and the only genesis involved in it is through the ontogenies by which it is created. DeBeer in the concluding chapter of his valuable analysis of recapitulation theories in Embryos and Ancestors (1940), tells us flatly that "phylog- eny plays no causal part in determining ontog- eny," and that it "does not explain ontogeny at all." The experimental embryologist, as De- Beer conceives him, is supposed to deal with factors such as organizers, etc., which are the immediate causes of the phenomena upon which he experiments. If the experimental embryologist should ever accomplish the stupendously difficult task of giving a causal explanation of the course of any ontogeny, his achievement would be anal- ogous to explaining on mechanistic principles how the time keeping of a watch results from its structural configuration. As the Reverend Mr. Paley would doubtless insist, it is the preformed structure of the watch which most requires ex- planation, and for this problem one is compelled to have recourse to a teleological interpretation. Suppose we succeed in tracing the chain of onto- genic causes back to the complex of genes with which development begins, and find that this complex, like the structure of the watch, deter- mines the course of events that follows; we would then have arrived at one stage which is as much the product of antecedent causes as any stage that comes after it. A causal explanation of development that accounts for its teleological aspects would include a knowledge of the steps by which the germ plasm came to be so consti- tuted that it develops into a harmoniously func- tioning whole. If we follow these steps back and back, we should find that the germ plasm was constituted thus and so, because certain an- cestors survived in the struggle for existence. To a limited extent man determines the kind of ontogenies that are followed in his domesticated animals and plants through selecting the indi- viduals he permits to breed. And since nature does much the same sort of thing, one may look upon ontogeny as being in a sense guided by its phylogenic history. Back of every ontogeny is a long history of ever-branching and interlacing strands of germ plasm that is carried by the bodies which spring up at the meeting points of the strands. The complete ontogenies of all living organisms that arise from the nodes of the network of germ plasm are equally old; their apparent age differ- ences concern only the small parts of their lives spent in one body instead of as separate strands carried by innumerable progenitors. If I were able to explain why I am constructed as I am, instead of being an angle-worm or a black widow spider, I should have to know much about the multitudes of ancestors that carried the strands of germ plasm which have converged to produce my present outfit of genes. In other words, I should have to go into the subject of phylogeny quite extensively, if I were ever to gain an adequate causal explanation of my own ontogeny. DeBeer concedes that modifications due to external factors might affect ontogeny if acquired characters are inherited. But since this is re- garded as a very doubtful hypothesis, "it cannot be stated that phylogeny plays any part in ontog- eny at all." If, however, external factors in- fluence the kinds of variations that survive, as they demonstrably do, and if these variations influence the kinds of ontogenies that occur in the offspring, I cannot see, so far as our problem is concerned, that it makes any difference whether these conditions operate through the transmission of acquired characters, or by means of natural selection. In either case the events that form a part of the phylogenic history play a role in shap- ing the course of ontogeny. In fact, this conclu- sion is inevitable if we accord to phylogeny any sort of status as a real series of events. We cannot regard phylogeny as a mere passive Ahnenreihe like a series of ancestral portraits. Phylogenic history is as much a record of actual happenings as the events of human history, some of which are of chief interest to the biographer and others to the student of mass movements. It is of course obvious that phylogeny is made up of individual ontogenies and would have no existence without them, but it is also obvious that the com- plete history of the race would include all the events occurring in the development of every indi- vidual. After all, we are dealing with the same facts from different points of view. The occur- rences whirh for the purposes of scientific inter- pretation it is useful to consider as belonging to phylogenic history may cause and be caused by other events which we commonly regard as belong- ing to ontogenic development. The particular ontogeny of John Smith may have been what it was because Mrs. Green decided to give the party at which Henry Smith met Han- nah Jones. This meeting may be construed as an episode of phylogenic history or as an event in the</page><page sequence="12">330 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY ontogeny of the individuals concerned. But we must not forget Mrs. Green, without whose well- intentioned matchmaking proclivities a particular ovum might have developed into a quite different kind of a person from John Smith. The events of phylogenic history may affect successive genera- tions not only through direct inheritance but in various other ways. The incidence of selection, for instance, may have different effects upon ontog- enies in different environments. Whether or not the ontogenies are modified so as to produce the appearance of recapitulation, however, would depend upon many circumstances. Our brief survey has shown, I think, that the doctrine of recapitulation has had a rather curious history. This is largely because recapitulation has turned out to be something quite different from what it seemed to most of its adherents. We cannot regard it as a uniform expression of the mysterious creative forces of nature, as held by Kielmeyer, nor as a direct consequence of heredity, as maintained by Haeckel. We cannot consider it a manifestation of memory like the repetition of a tune, nor as a mechanically determined pushing back of embryonic characters, as postulated by Weismann. We may be justified in construing it as in part a function of the way in which germ- inal mutations fit into the physiology of develop- ment, but the appearance of recapitulation may also be merely an expression of the uniformities of relative growth. In the light of present knowl- edge, recapitulation represents no simple principle deducible from some more general law. It is rather a conglomerate effect of heterogeneous causes. We shall doubtless know more of at least some of these causes when the causal factors of embryonic development are better understood than they are today. LIST OF LITERATURE AMEGHINO, F. 1937.
