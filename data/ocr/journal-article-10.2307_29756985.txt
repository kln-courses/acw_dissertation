<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Unique Iron Age Grave Complex from South India by K. Pulla Rao In the dense forests of Khammam and Warangal districts of Andhra Pradesh (South India) we come across a unique type of megalithic monuments (x), not so far reported from any other part of the world (fig. 1). These monuments are the most sophisticated amongst the Indian megaliths. Scholars like Mulheran (1868: 147-51), William King (1877: 179-85) and Khwaja Muhammad Ahmad (1950) have provided some gleanings of these monuments. But, so far, no systematic attempt has been made to study them. The vagaries of both man and nature are equally contributing to the fast destruction of these monuments. The present author has painfully observed numerous of these monuments being destroyed for their stone in road-laying and house-building. This paper aims at highlighting their archaeological significance with a view to drawing the attention of the archaeologists to these unique monuments before they completely disappear from the scene. The monuments encountered in this region are mainly dolmenoid cists enclosed in a dressed-stone circle (fig. 2). Most of the monuments occur in clusters of few hundreds and sometimes even two to three thousand at a place. The Janampet cluster is probably, the largest one, containing more than 4,000 monuments. Usually the monuments are found on the hill tops or on the elevated places of natural outcrop. This area abounds in sandstone deposits and this was the chief material used in the construction of these monuments. These monuments form a class of their own as they are constructed out of finely-dressed stone blocks, unlike the rest of the megalithic monuments found all over the world, which are erected out of rough stone blocks. Other unique features of these monuments include the use of stone sarcophagus and association of anthropomorphic figures. The constructional details of these monuments are described below. When we approach these Iron Age cemeteries, we notice, first of all, numerous stone circles, each enclosing a dolmenoid cist. We also come across two dolmenoid cists enclosed by a single stone circle, but, such instances are very few. The circle is formed by perfectly dressed stone blocks juxtaposed end to end. The diameter of the circle ranges between 10 and 35 m. Each stone block of the circle measures 1 to 2 m. in length and 20 to 60 cm. in thickness. A slight curvature is given to these blocks so as to form a perfect circle. The circle is usually raised to a height of about 0.50 m. above the ground, but we also notice some monuments with the circle hardly visible on the ground. In the midst of the circle is the dolmenoid cist which houses the funerary assemblage. C) Discovered by the present author. [1] 363</page><page sequence="2">5 0 5 10 15 I i I i i Km.

The dolmenoid cist is also constructed out of finely-trimmed stone blocks and looks near-square to rectangular in shape. Each side is covered by a single or more (two to four) orthostats. The capstone is always a huge block of stone, almost corresponding to the length and breadth (outer) of the burial chamber. Occasionally, we also observe the capstone overhanging the orthostats. A squarish porthole is carved in one of the orthostats, measuring about 0.50 m. each side, big enough to allow an average person into the chamber. No particular orientation was observed in respect of the porthole, though west seems to be the most common direction. Some monuments have a passage in front of the porthole, in which case it is observed that the porthole was blocked by a stone slab. The gap between the stone circle and the dolmenoid cist is filled with cairn packing. Stone coffins (sarcophagi) were interred with skeletal remains and other funerary assemblage. Occasionally depressions were made in the bottom-rock itself for placing the funerary assemblage. We come across hundreds of stone coffins in the nearby villages, which were robbed from these graves and are now being used as water containers for cattle and for other domestic purposes. The usual length of these coffins is about 2 m. We also notice smaller ones, probably for burying the children. No lid is provided to these coffins. We notice three to six coffins in each monument. Funerary assemblage was placed in these coffins and then covered with earth and buried to the brim. Earthen sarcophagi have been encountered at several megalithic sites in India and abroad, but, use of stone sarcophagus or stone coffin is, probably, a special feature noticed in this region only. Still more interesting and unique feature is the association of anthropomorphic figures 366 [4]</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 4 - Anthropomorphic figure, Tottigutta. with a few of these burials (Rao 1987: 13-16). These anthropomorphic figures (figs. 3-6) are very rude in the form and simple in message ? a message conveying association of human figure with these burials. These figures are found sporadically, requiring great efforts in locating them. So far, about 30 figures have come to light, but an exhaustive exploration of this region may result in the discovery of some more figures and possibly with hitherto unknown features. The present author had a chance to study and photograph a few of these rare anthropomorphic figures. The mystery behind the association of these figures with the burials is not known. Whether they represent god, ghost or man is also not clear. But, the relationship between the anthropomorphic figures and the megalithic burials need not be doubted as some of the figures are planted within the circle. Corroborative evidence in this regard comes from Midimalla in Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh, where two anthropomorphic figures are found forming part of the grave architecture itself (Rao 1988: pis. 4 and 14). The localities where such anthropomorphic figures were noticed are Domada*, Tottigutta*, Kaperlaguru (King 1877: 179-85, pis. XI and XII), Katapur (Mulheran 1868: 150), and Malin (Mulheran 1868: 150) in the Warangal district and Dongatogu* in the Khammam district. Most of these anthropomorphic figures reveal only the upper limbs and the head. Neither the legs nor the organs like eyes, ears, nose and mouth are represented. Hands are also not [5]</page><page sequence="6">depicted in some of the figures. The most interesting figure amongst them is the one revealing feminine features (fig. 3), discovered at Tottigutta. This is the only female anthropomorphic figure so far known. On the bosom of this figure, breasts are clearly depicted to represent feminine characteristics. Except this, all the other figures are too plainly carved to distinguish even their front from their back. Some of the figures from Katapur and Malin closely resemble the Latin cross, leading Mulheran to mistake them for objects of Christian origin (Mulheran 1868: 147-51). Anthropomorphic figures in association with the megalithic burials are also noticed at Mottur in the North Arcot district of Tamil Nadu (Narasimhaiah 1975: 157-59), Rajankolur in the Gulbarga district of Karnataka (Sundara 1975: pis. 4 and 14). But, these places are far removed to suggest any direct link with the anthropomorphic figures found in the area under discussion. Whether the features like trimmed-stone circle, stone sarcophagus and anthropomorphic figures have developed independently or have counterparts in some part of the world is a moot question to be solved. Probably due to inaccessibility of the area, these interesting monuments have not attracted any attention of the scholars in the recent past. Since Khwaja Muhammad Ahmad's excavation, more than fifty years ago, no attempt has been made to study these monuments. No doubt, Ahmad's contribution is very significant, but, his scope was limited because of the undeveloped excavation techniques and lack of corroborative information. It is high time that the Institutions engaged in the archaeological research undertake a study of these unique monuments to unravel the secrets encompassed in them and fix a proper chronological perspective to these monuments. 368 [6]</page><page sequence="7">REFERENCES Ahmad, Khwaja Muhammad (1950) Preliminary Excavations at Prehistoric Sites near ]anampet.
