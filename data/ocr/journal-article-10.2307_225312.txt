VILFREDO PARETO, of an old Genoese family, grandson of a marquis</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 457 of NAPOLEON'S creationi, sol 0o1 a distinguished conspirator in the cause of a free, united, and republican Italy, was born in Paris in I848. His father was an engineer, and he himself was trained as one, graduating from the Polytechnic Institute in Turin at the age of twenty-two. He practised his profession in Rome and in Florence for a few years and then settled in Florence to study economics. Several of his papers on the subject attracted wide attention, and in 1894 he was recommended by LEON WALRAS as his successor in the chair of political economy at the Utliversity of Lausanne. PARETO published two books on mathematical economics, Cours d'economie politique (I896-7) and Manuale di econonlia politica (I906), which were important not only in their own day but as forerunners of subsequent fruitful developments in economic theory. But PARETO recognized that economics, unless supplemented by an investigrtion of other social phenomena, could give but an unsatisfactory account of societies ancient and modern. He turned to the study of what is cailed sociology. The eventual result was the Trattato di Sociologia generale, which appeared first in I9I6 and in a French translation a year later. T'he Mind and Society is its first English translation. PARETO died inl 1923. The Ml1ind and Society opens with a chapter in which PARETO discusses the more general rules of method which have been found expedient in scientific iinvestigations. These rules, he states, will be followed in his book. Among other things, he will go forward by successive approximations. That is to say, we shall first consider things as wholes, deliberately ignoring details. Of the latter we shall then take account in successive approximations " (? 69). And The Mind and Society itself is but a first approximation toward a systematic study of societies. The Mind and Society falls roughly into two parts, an inductive part and a deductive part. In the first part, through arn assembly and classifica- tion of relevant facts, a certain number of uniformities among these facts present themselves. In the second part, inferences are drawn from these uniformities, and the inferences are compared with further facts. If these facts do not bear out the inferences, then the uniformities, the hypotheses from which they were drawn must be rejected. All this may seem platitudinous, but it is important to insist on such platitudes in a subject like sociology, which is not so mature a science that these things can be taken for granted, as they can in physics. The conduct of men is an important factor determining the form of society. PARETO begins by dividing this conduct into two classes of actions, which he calls logical actions, and non-logical actions. Logical actions are actions the results of which are objectively and subjectively</page><page sequence="3">458 ISIS, XXIV, 2 identical. Non-logical actions are other actions. Thus when the seamen of Aeneas row their ships in order to reach the haven where they would be, their action of rowing is a logical action. That is, the result of the rowing is both subjectively, to the seamen, and objectively, to a detached observer, the accomplishment of the voyage. But when they sacrifice to the gods before putting to sea, theirs is a non-logical action. Subjectively, to the seamen, the result of the sacrifice is believed to be favorable winds and calm seas. Objectively, to the detached observer, the result is nothing of the sort. A dichotomy of this sort, however vaguely expressed, is familiar in everyday life. Men are forced by the practical necessities of existence to accomplish a certain number of logical actions. In general, these are the actions-counting out mistakes-by which men gain food, clothing, shelter, pleasure, wealth, honor, and power. They are prominent in the activities we call business, industry, agriculture, engineering, strategy and tactics, the arts, and so on. On the other hand, typical non-logical actions, according to PARETO'S scheme, are the practice of magic, observance of the cult of a religion, attachment to home and country, self-sacrifice, and so on. Some people have found fault with PARETO'S definitions of logical and non-logical actions. Granted that the distinction between the two cannot be applied to give a clear-cut result in every case, still the point is not an important one. For PARETO uses the distinction largely as a means of specifying what he is not going to talk about. The logical behavior of men has always been well understood, perhaps for the very reason that it is logical, and in modern times some logical behavior has been thoroughly studied, for instance in economics. Therefore PARETO says that he is not going to talk about it, at least for the moment. On the other hand, there is no good general study o-f non-logical behavior, and non-logical behavior is not only important in determining the form of human societies but indispensable to these societies. To this PARETO turns his attention. Words men produce as well as deeds. As well as actions, PARETO divides some of the phenomena of language, theories, into the logical and the non-logical. Logical theories are those which are in accord with observed fact. Non-logical theories are other theories. In former times, non-logical theories were cornmon in the physical and biological sciences, for example, the theory that since the circle is the perfect figure, the orbit of a planet must be a circle-a statement which is not confirmed by observed fact. The progress of the sciences in question has consisted largely in substituting logical theories for such non-logical ones. In contrast to the state of affairs in these sciences, non-logical theories</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 459 still are, as they have always been, common among the things men say about what they do, about hunian institutions, and particularly, common in what men say about their non-logical actions. For instance, there are such as: " The Germans are an Aryan race "; " Men are born free and equal "; " Virtue is rewarded and vice punished." As has been explained, logical actions are those the results of which are objectively and subjectively identical. To be so, these actions must be based on an objective knowledge of the relevant facts. And since logical theories are theories which are in accord with the facts, actions based on inferences from logical theories are among the logical actions. Thus, actions based on inferences from NEWTON'S laws. of motion are likely to be logical. On the other hand, actions based on inferences from non-logical theories -are likely to be non-logical, though they are not necessarily so. As a matter of fact, few non-logical actions are based on theories of any kind. But people like to invent non-logical theories and. persuade themselves that the theories are logical and that many of their actions are simply the result of logical deductions therefrom. The theories about men and their behavior in societies, may be con- sidered under three heads, which niust be kept distinct. First, one may ask about them Are they in accord with observed fact, that iS, are they logical or non-logical ? Second, if they are not -in accord with fact, why are they produced and accepted? Thirdly, are these theories useful to the societies in which they are current? PARETO asserts that a non- logical theory may well be very useful to society, a logical theory very harmful. Thus the theory that virtue is rewarded and vice punished is not borne out by the facts, but society could not exist as we know it without the -sentiments expressed in some such theory and, perhaps, not without their expression a-s well. On the other hand, while PARETO'S own theories are largely in agreement with the facts, he would have ad- mitted that assent to his theories by the mass of men, supposing it possible, would be harmful to society. PARETO takes up the first two of these questions immediately, postponing consideration of the third until later in the book. For this purpose he begins by describing the different theories men have propounded to the effect that the weather can be affected by the performance of certain acts. These include the belief that rain can be produced by magical rites, such as the firing of a gun, and so on. These theories, are of course non-logical; they are not borne out by the facts. Why then are they produced and accepted? PARETO comes to the conclusion that it is because they correspond to and bring into play certain sentimients of men. The theories of the ways of influencing the weather by magic fall</page><page sequence="5">46o ISIS, XXIV, 2 into two parts. There is a part (a) which is the sentiment that the weather can be affected by the performance of certain rites. This part corresponds directly with the non-logical behavior which is the actual performance of these rites, so that if the sentiment is known the behavior also is known. This part (a) is relatively constant throughout the theories. There is also a part (b) in which men give the reasons why they believe the performance of the rites to be efficacious in influencing the weather. Thus they may say that the firing of a gun shocks the rain out of the clouds. Experience shows that this part (b) of the theories is relatively variable. As well as in theories about the ways of influencing the weather, these parts (a) and (b) are to be found in many of the non-logical theories that men propound in connection with their other non-logical actions. PARETO calls the parts (a) residues and the part (b) derivations. Even when men do not act logically, they want to make their actions seem logical. Often, too, they feel a need to disguise from others and from themselves the motives which in fact led them to accomplish a certain action. These sentiments the derivations satisfy: it is the process called by the psycho-analysts rationalization. A derivation sets up a god of the winds and one, furthermore, who is expected to act in the way a human being would act in analogous circumstances-the god, like the human being, is placated by a gift. In this way, the derivation makes the non-logical action, the sacrifice to calm the winds, look as if it were a logical action, that is, an action based on a calculation from observed fact. But the god is not observed fact, and the theory in which he appears is non-logical. Of course this statement leaves out of consideration many factors. For one thing, no one ever adopts or can adopt a derivation because he has in this manner consciously analyzed its function. The residues are evidently a more important factor in determining the form of societies than the derivations, for experience shows that, given a residue, men never have any difficulty in finding a derivation to rationalize it. Furthermore, if for any one of a number of reasons a derivation connected with a given residue is destroyed, another appears to take its place, or two derivations may flourish side by side. For these reasons, the residues are more constant than the derivations, and the experience of scientists has been that constant phenomena are important phenomena. Everyone knows this is true of such things as a stable ratio among the chief currencies of the world. If the ratio changes, there is trouble. Says PARETO: " Science looks for the constant parts of phenomena in order to reach the knowledge of uniformities." (? 218). The early part of The M14ind and Society accomnplishes two things.</page><page sequence="6">REVIEWS 46I First, it prepares for the analysis represented by residues and derivations. Second, it makes general observations on the ways in which social science has gone wrong in the past and on the ways it must take to go right in the future: that is, it must follow the rules which have been found indispensable in the more advanced sciences. In this connection, a large number of the many theories in sociological works,past and present, which are not in accord with fact fall within the field of the derivations. There are two sorts of people, on the whole, who produce and accept such sociological theories. First, people who justify their own sentiments and non-logical actions by means of these non-logical theories. Second, people who, although their own sentiments are not directly involved, translate in sociological theories the observed non-logical actions of men into logical actions. The first sort of people are producing derivations in the strict sense ; the second sort of people are thinking in a way that is closely akin to producing derivations. An example of the first kind of sociologists are the socialist theorists. (The so-called Fascist intellectuals would do just as well.) In the socialist theories, the constant element is obvious, a dissatisfaction with one political and economic regime or another and an effort to overthrow it. The constant element is justified in terms of a large amount of theoretical material, some logical, some non-logical. The non-logical part has shown a tendency to vary. In particular, historical inter- pretations have changed as time has failed to bear out some of MARX' predictions. A characteristic of such theories is that they are arrived at by a way of reasoning which PARETO calls reasoning by accord of sentiments. For example, a certain person does not like wars. He also does not like something he calls capitalism. The inference is obvious to him: capitalism is the cause of wars-a non-logical theory. Reasoning by accord of sentiments was common in the Middle Ages in such sciences as physics and astronomy. Of course, if a theory which arises by accord of sentiments is used as scientists use such a theory-as an hypothesis to be accepted or rejected according as it is confirmed by the facts or not confirmed-then no harm is done. But people are likely to elevate such theories into absolutes. On the whole, the maturer sciences have progressed by abandoning this kind of reasoning and confiining themselves to observation of fact and strictly logical inference therefrom. Sociology, PARETO thinks, is in a positiorn now like that of the physical sciences in medieval times. Only by following a similar path can it make progress. The second kind of sociologists, those who translate non-logical actions into logical ones, fall in turn into two groups. Tfhere are those who</page><page sequence="7">462 isis, xxiv, 2 take at their face value the derivations other men have used to make their non-logical actions seem logical. Thus the friction between North and South which led to the American Civil War has been described as if it really was, what some people said it was at the time, a constitutional debate over " States' Rights." There are others who, even when the men they observe have used no derivations to explain their non-logical actions, find without any trouble their own logical explanations for these actions. Such are the anthropologists, particularly those of a former generation, who, in accounting for the anthropomorphism of primitive peoples, have given the primitives credit for a logical subtlety they do not possess. All such students of society, even if they have half perceived the non-logical character of many of the actions of men, at once describe them as if they were logical, as if men simply carried out conclusions logically drawn from abstract principles. Since they are themselves trained in logical thinking, such sociologists have unconsciously assumed that men in general act logically. They have made over mankind in their own image. In summary of the first part of PARETO'S book, the following may be said. A considerable number of the actions of men are non-logical. Men, however, want to make these actions seem logical. They invent principles and persuade themselves that these actions are their logical consequences. Many students of society, also, are so persuaded, and study these principles as a primary factor in determining the form of human societies. A study of the facts, however, shows that these principles vary greatly, whereas the ways men act remain relatively constant, and the experience of the mature sciences teaches that in order to set up statements of uniformities (scientific laws) people must first consider the constant elements in phenomena. The method, then, of the above- mentioned students of society is inexpedient. After So much in general about PARETO'S way of attacking the problems of sociology, it is not necessary to go into detail about the work of the main portion of his book. He classifies the residues-which correspond to uniformities observed in the non-logical actions of men-into six classes. The first class he calls Combinations. They include: (a) manifestations of the instinct to invent, to try something new, and (b) the motives of some of these combinations, such as the combination of fancied likes with likes in sympathetic magic. The second class PARETO calls Persistent Aggregates (translated Group Persistences in the present English version.) They include manifestations of the feelinlgs which are summed up in the word home in contrast to the word house in the expression house and home. Also devotion to one's country, to one's ancestors, to one's social class, to an abstraction or personification</page><page sequence="8">REVIEWS 463 such as liberty. These residues furnish that element of stability and routine without which any society would go to pieces. These first two classes of residues are the two in terms of which PARETO chiefly works later in his book. The other classes of residues include such things as manifestations of sentiments in actions, such as crying or cheering, uniformities of dress and behavior, pity,asceticism,self-sacrifice, feelings of inferiority or superiority in the social hierarchy, maintenance of the integrity of the individual, such as his honor, and sexual residues. This is a loose and not exhaustive classification, and PARETO, who set it up with one end in view, did not make a distinction, which is important from another point of view, between two main kinds of residues in his list. There are the residues which are manifestations of impulses which are part of the animal, as opposed to the specifically human, inheritance of men. Thus dogs, as well as men, manifest their sentiments in actions, by wagging their tails. There are also the residues, the ways of behaving, which are imposed on an individual through his membership in a specific, organized, human society. The derivations-the things men say to explaini their non-logical actions-PARETO divides into four classes, which he calls Affirmations, Authority, Accord of Sentiments, Verbal Proofs. To reach a first approximate description of the workings of society, PARETO says he will consider the interaction of four variables: the residues, the derivations, the interests, and the circulation of the elite. These last two *factors appear late in The Mind and Society. The interests iS PARETO'S name for those of the logical actions of men which other people would call the economic interests of men, or other interests like them. The circulation of the elite takes into consideration the hetero- geneity of society and the rise of men from the subject class into the governing class. These four variables are in a state of mutual dependence. Each of them acts on the others and is acted upon by the others. PARETO says that there are two main ways of describing the successive states taken by a system of this sort, a system of mutually dependent variables. One is to consider changes in one of the variables as the cause of the changes in the other variables. Many students of society have reasoned in this way, for example, the adepts of the economic interpretation of history. But this does not give a significant result, because no account is taken of the mutual dependence of the variables. The other way is to take account of this mutual dependence. This in turn falls into two forms. The first and most satisfactory is to set up mathematically a series of simultaneous equations. Unfortunately this method has still little application in sociology, for we lack satisfactory measures of many</page><page sequence="9">464 ISIS, XXIV, 2 of the most important variables, and therefore we are unable to use mathematics. The alternative is to take accoulnt of the state of mutual dependence by considering systematically the action of each variable in turn on the others and then considering the reaction of these variables on the first. This is the method PARETO uses in treating of the mutual dependence of residues, derivations, interests, and the circulation of the elite. It loses some of its disadvantage as a method when one variable is relatively a more important variable than some of the others. In this case, as has been shown, the residues are a more important variable than the derivations. The four factors which PARETO considers show two kinds of mutual dependence. One is the direct kind of mutual dependence which has just been described. The other is the indirect mutual dependence to which these factors are subject as all being elements of a system, the social system. One of the characteristics of this second kind of mutual dependence is that of the equilibrium of such systems. That is, if there is a change in any one of the elements of the system, all the elements will react in such a way as to tend to restore the system to its original state. With these logical tools and these abstractions from observed fact, PARETO makes a deductive interpretation of several parts of history. The facts will show many of his conclusions to be wrong, but there is no doubt of the soundness of his method of approach. Of the factors that went to make The Mind and Society what it is, PARETO'S experience in applied mathematics is one of the most important. His thesis upon graduation from the Polythechnic Institute in Turin concerned the mathematical theory of equilibrium in elastic solids, and he worked at mathematics all his life. Mathematics has found a steadily widening field of application in the sciences. From physics and astro- nomy, it has spread into thermo-dynamics, chemistry, and so on. ANTOINE-AUGUSTIN COURNOT, first seriously attempted to use mathe- matics in economics. LE'ON WALRAS, PARETO'S predecessor at Lausanne, developed the mathematical theory of equilibrium in that field. Elabo- rated and extended by PARETO, this body of work in its main features stands today. Miathematics is the only method so far devised satisfactory for the logical analysis of states of complicated mutual dependence among variables. A man wvho is experienced in the mathematical analysis of states of this sort, will, even in the cases in which he is unable to apply mathe- matics, be aware of certain things which are beyond a man who has not had this kind of experienlce. Among states of complicated mutual dependence among variables are social systems. Unfortunately mathematics cannot be widely applied in the analysis of social systems. But PARETO, although</page><page sequence="10">REVIEWS 465 he was unable to use his mastery of mathematics in their study, was by previous experience in the mathematical analysis of other such systems, in mathematics and economics, aware that the mutual dependence had somehow to be taken into consideration and of the difficulties in doing so. These things are likely to escape sociologists without training in mathematics. In the absence of mathematics, PARETO took account of the mutual dependence of the variables in the social system by considering first the action of one of the variables on the others, then their reaction on the first, and so on systematically, as described above. This is a clumsy method, and as a result some people have called The Mind and Society over-elaborate and pretentious. If they had had the kind of experience PARETO had, they would perhaps have understood that he adopted the method only for lack of a better one. Experience only, not intelligence, can teach them this. Besides his experience in applied mathematics, three main elements in PARETO'S acquirem.ents are prominent in The Mind and Society. First, he was widely acquainted with the history of and the work being done in the natural sciences. He was familiar with applied physics and celestial mechanics-witness his discussion of the methods of approaching the investigation of the tides (? I73 i)-and to a lesser extent with chemistry and biology. A second element was his knowledge of Greek and Latin literature, from which he drew very largely the illustrative material of The MVJind and Society. A classical scholar of standing has testified that in this field PARETO avoided almost all mistakes of the first order. Finally, PARETO knew in detail the history of parliamentary democracy in France and Italy. This probably stems from the time when PARETO himself in his earlier years was fighting the protectionist policy of the Italian government. In sociology, ARISTOTLE and of course MACHIAVELLI were his predecessors in the study of what men do, not what they ought to do. He was also much influenced by PIERRE BAYLE, author of the Dictionnaire historique et critique. Another sociologist who affected him greatly as a young man was COMTE, but he seems to have outgrown this influence in the main, if we can judge by his analysis of COMTE'S theories in The Mind and Society. Among his contemporaries he was closest to GEORGES SOREL, and each of the two men seems to have influenced the other's thinking. He had read, too, many of the other important sociological and anthropological works of'his time. PARETO'S analysis of past history led him to expect that some regime which used much force in governing would overthrow the government by ruse of decadent parliamentary democracy. This prediction was I I</page><page sequence="11">466 Isis, XXIV, 2 of course verified in MUSSOLINI'S March on Rome, and the Fascists have rationalized what they have done in terms of PARETO'S theories. But there is nothing to show that PARETO took sides himself. His personal preference was for liberty and the federal government of Switzerland, and his theories can be used to explain what has happened in Germany and in Russia as well as in Italy. All these considerations, however, have naturally not prevented some people from calling PARETO " the Marx of Fascism." The present translation into English of PARETO'S Trattato di Sociologia generale by ANDREW BONGIORNO and ARTHUR LIVINGSTON is what may be called a literary translation. It is not always a literal translation even when to be literal would involve no clumsiness of expression in English. For instance, in ? 2I8, a literal translation of one of PARETO'S sentences would run: " It is precisely the constant elements in phenomena that science seeks in order to reach the knowledge of uni- formities. This is translated by BONGIORNO and LIVINGSTON: Now science looks for constant elements in phenomena in order to get at uniformities." Though- more lively in tone than a literal translation, this translation hardly is a gain in clarity, particularly the expression "to get at uniformities." Again, in ? I26 the present translators render the Italian word vincolo, referring to a particular kind of condition in mechanics, as ties, although there is already a good English expression used in treatises on mechanics to refer to just this kind of condition, the expression connections and constraints. Furthermore, some of PARETO'S own technical expressions have been changed by these translators. For instance, a literal translation of PARETO'S name for residues of the second class would be Persistence of Aggregates. This has been rendered in the present version Group Persistences, again hardly a gain, especially at a time when the word group is being used by sociologists on every conceivable occasion. But as PARETO himself says, one must never dispute over words. As long as the translators use the -words they have chosen unambiguously and consistently, there can be no quarrel with them. This BONGIORNO and LIVINGSTON have done; indeed LIVINGSTON has been very honest in pointing out in footnotes all serious departures from a strict rendering of PARETO'S Italian text. The point of view which determined the character of this translation is described in LIVINGSTON'S " Editor's Note," where he explains why he called the translation The Mind and Society instead of Treatise of General Sociology. "It is my faith," he writes, "which I assert as a faith, and perhaps quia absurdum, that the general public is interested, and has an interest, in objective thinking apart from sentiment-." This is a curious position to take in the face of PARETO'S own remarks in ? 86 on the probable</page><page sequence="12">REVIEWS 467 popularity of his book :-" My sole interest is the quest for, social uni- formities, social laws. I am here reporting on the results of my quest, since I hold that in view of the restricted number of readers such a study can have and in view of the scientific training that may be taken fox granted in them, such a report can do no harm. I should refrain from doing so if I could reasonably imagine that these volumes were to be at all generally read." We must be endlessly grateful to BONGIORNO and LIVINGSTON for translating the Trattato into English and for supplying it with a thorough index, a feature which the book has lacked up to now. We must be grateful for the reverence with which they have treated PARETO'S work. But, in- short, theirs is a literary translation of a book which in the original is not literarv in tone or purpose, a book written' by one scientist for other scientists. Perhaps a translation of this sort is a legitimate concession to the publisher who was willing to take the risk of printing such a book but wanted some prospect of selling a few copies to the general public. It must be pointed out, however, that the French translation of the Trattato, which was revue by PARETO himself, has not these defects of The Mind and Society. Harvard University. GEORGE C.
