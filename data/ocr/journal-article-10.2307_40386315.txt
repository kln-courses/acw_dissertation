Calling on me early in 1944, he explained that Dr. Holmes à Court, a leading Sydney physician, advised him against taking up private practice and instead to work his way on to the University staff. He was interested in Anthropology, especially Physical Anthropology, and asked me whether I would accept him as a candidate for the post-graduate Diploma in Anthropology. I did, and so began our friendship and co-operation which continued until his death, thirty three years later. Arch. &amp; Phys. Anthrop. in Oceania.

MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK Mac, Black Mac as he was known to most University people, completed the Anthropology I and II courses in 1944-1945 with High Distinction, and also Geology I with Distinction thus gaining insight into the geological aspect of archaeology into which his studies of early man were to lead him. In 1947, too, he took post-graduate courses in statistics, protozoology and para- sitology in the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine in the University of Sydney. A thesis entitled "Critical Studies on the antiquity of Man in Australia; in addition, some facts relating to the possible origin, migration and affinities of Australians and Tasmanians" brought him the Diploma in Anthropology. In his research for this he was encouraged and advised by J. L. Shellshear, Research Professor of Anatomy, who, one of Professor Grafton Elliot Smith's post-graduate students, as I was, had made an important contribution on "The Brain of the Australian Aboriginal: a study in cerebral morphology", published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, 1937. In the same Transactions in 1934, Shellshear and G. Elliot Smith had published "A comparative study of the endo-cranial cast of Sinanthropus" . While coping with this Diploma work and other courses, Mac was successively Demonstrator (1944), Lecturer (1945-47) and Senior Lecturer (1948-49) in Anatomy, and, following the award of the Diploma, became Reader (1950-54). He was Acting Head of the Department in 1953-54 during Prof. A. N. Burkitt's absence overseas and illness, Acting Professor 1954-55, and Challis Professor of Anatomy from 4th July 1955 to 28th February, 1973. He was then appointed Emeritus Professor and also in 1973, Hon. Associate, Dept. of Surgery. Neil William George Macintosh, son of G. G. J. Macintosh, sculptor, was born in Sydney, December 27th, 1906, matriculated with Honours in History and English and an Exhibition in Medicine, and graduated M.B., B.S., Sydney, in December, 1933. From 1934 to 1937 he was Registrar, Neurosurgical Unit and later Medical Superintendent at Lewisham Hospital, Sydney. He acted as Ship's Surgeon on two trips to Java in holidays, and also on the journey to England in 1937 and the return in 1939. While abroad, Mac took post-graduate courses in Edinburgh, London and Budapest. In the Department of Anatomy Mac quickly established himself as an excellent tutor, demonstrator and lecturer, just as he was a first- class public lecturer. The Department was some- what run-down as a result of his predecessor's serious illness, but Mac brought it to life again. The staff was increased; research encouraged; and, most importantly, he generated enthusiastic teamwork from the technical and secretarial through to the academic staff in the Department, in the field and in the Wilson and Shellshear Museums. The latter, which he named after Professor J. L.</page><page sequence="3">Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK. PLATE I N. W. G. Macintosh in the field, Western New South Wales, August, 1974.

MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK 87 Shellshear, has a very good collection of crania, especially Aboriginal. Mr. Stan Larnach, for many years a member of the Department's technical staff, was in time appointed Curator of this Museum. He became Macintosh's devoted co-worker in craniology, and in 1973 the University of Sydney conferred on him the M.Sc. degree, Honoris causa, in recognition of his contribution to physical anthropology. Amongst the changes Mac wrought, was developing a very successful scheme of selecting "trainee-surgeons" as demonstrators and tutoring them for their Primary F.R.A.C.S. examination. He also showed an awareness of the needs of dental students by actively supporting his dental staff in their teaching and research. As one of his Associate Professors, B. C. W. Barker, who became responsible for this section, has stated, Professor Macintosh provided separate Dissecting Room complexes, a staff of mainly dental graduates, and a fully equipped Dental Anthropological Research Unit. He also supported post-graduate education in the subject. No wonder then, that as retirement drew near, Professor Macintosh was elected an Hon. Fellow of the Royal Australian College of Dental Surgeons (1971) and also to an Hon. Fellowship of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (1972). In the Wider Scientific World While never neglecting the many activities of his Department, staff and students, Mac did not fail to join and assist wherever possible organizations in which a specialist in anatomy or anthropology could be of use. His memberships included The Australian Medical Association, Anatomical Society of Australia and New Zealand (Foundation Member 1963, Life Member 1971), Anatomical Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, American Association of Anatomists, International Society of Human Biologists, Zoological Society of N.S.W. and, for a time, the Linnean Society of N.S.W., and in the applied field, the Australian Forensic Society (N.S.W. Branch) and the Australian Academy of Forensic Sciences (1967-73) of which he was a Foundation member and member of Council and of the Executive and Editorial Committees. Moreover, he was Honorary Consultant to the Criminal Investigation Branch and assisted it in many medico-legal inquiries. In the anthropological sphere, he was a member of the Anthropological Society of N.S.W., (President in 1951), of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists, of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science (President of Section F, Anthropology 1967), of the Museums of Man and Science, Johannesburg, (Founder member, 1973), and, possibly the most significant, he was a Foundation Member of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, 1961, Council Member, 1964-77, Chairman 1966-74. Professor Macintosh was Chairman of the Institute (1966-74) during a period of great expansion both in organization and in research. The foundations</page><page sequence="6">88 Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK had been firmly laid by the Interim Council (1961-1963) and research panels, by the Institute's first Chairman, Professor A. D. Trendall (1961-66) and by the first Principal, Mr. F. D. McCarthy (1963-72). Macintosh followed Trendall and Dr. P. Ucko followed McCarthy in 1972. Commonwealth grants to the Institute grew to a height we could hardly have imagined in 1961, that is, apart from Mr. W. Wentworth, through whose inspiration and energy the Institute came into being. Its activities were multiplied to include all aspects of "Aboriginal Studies": social, cultural, and physical anthropology, prehistory and archaeology; linguistics, musicology and art: various aids to research such as filming, recording, and documenting; and finally a vigorous publications section. And so the story went on. All this raised problems of headquarters and research staff, of permanent offices and facilities for library, archives and general storage. Responsibility for the effective running of the organization with officers and committees and the expenditure of funds by the Institute lay with the Council and its Chairman. Professor Macintosh accepted this responsibility to the full. The Chairman was not a figure-head. At times he made two journeys a month to Canberra; he had long and very frequent telephone consultations with the Principal and with staff; flew to distant parts of the Continent to get first-hand knowledge of research needs and problems in the field; had interviews with Cabinet Ministers and Government Departmental authorities; and conducted the business of meetings - General, Council, Executive and special. All this, added to his task as Head of the Department of Anatomy, University of Sydney, to his own research activity, and to the many usually welcome calls on him by fellow- workers was a great, almost too great, drain on his physical and nervous energy. He realized this as was evident in our frequent lunch hours together. He was one who took a great deal, often too much, out of himself in responses to the calls of office, especially of honorary positions such as the Institute's Chairman- ship - responses which are not always appreciated. In this case, however, Mr. R. I. Viner, Commonwealth Minister for Aboriginal Affairs from December, 1975, learning of Mac's contribution as Chairman of the Institute, and meeting him since, referred in a letter of appreciation to his probably immeasurable contribution to the work of the Institute, and added: "I believe that the established position and high repute which the Institute now enjoys is in very large measure attributable to your guidance through its early years. I would like on behalf of the Government to express my gratitude to you for your services to the Institute and to Aboriginal Studies . . ." And yet no member of the current executive staff of the Institute, nor indeed any anthropologist, came down from Canberra, to attend the funeral service of farewell in the North Shore Crematorium Chapel on 30th November, 1977. He, when Chairman, had gone to Canberra over 60 times. His successor, however, a member of the University of Sydney Department of Anthropology,</page><page sequence="7">Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK 89 had expressed to Mrs. Macintosh and myself his deep regret that he would be out of the State. The name, "The Macintosh Room", given to the Institute's Conference Room last year, is an appropriate memorial, which gave Mac quiet satisfaction in his year of bodily stress, and the obituary in the Institute's News- letter (No. 9, January, 1978) by that senior distinguished American physical anthropologist, Professor W. W. Howells, proclaims sincerely and "loudly" the high opinion anthropologists abroad held of Mac, the scientist, but the Institute itself has yet to tell its story of Professor Macintosh, Chairman and Councillor. For the rest of us, scientific colleagues or not, the large congegration at that Crematorium service was our tribute to Mac; it included the Chancellor, Deputy Vice-chancellors and senior administrative staff of the University of Sydney, and Professors and other members of staff, academic, secretarial and technical - some coming out of retirement. Macintosh - Anthropologist and Prehistorian Mac's list of publications shows that his scientific research lay principally in physical anthropology and in relevant phases and aspects of prehistory, for he was attracted to the topic of early man in Australia. Unfinished tasks and unsolved problems remained over from the few Australian finds which might throw light on that topic. Such were Talgai, Cohuna and Keilor, and others were turning up. In addition, he had two significant related interests: primitive watercraft and the dingo. The earliest Australian Aborigines must have used the former, and the latter must have been associated with subsequent Aboriginal immigrants who occupied the mainland after its separation by the ocean from Tasmania. When tackling these unfinished tasks, he began by searching both the scholarly literature and also other likely printed and written sources for any relevant references, never mind how tenuous some might be. A mention in a country newspaper could lead to a source of information, written or personal. Indeed, he followed such trails in astonishing detail, - in almost sleuth-like fashion, as for example when working on Cohuna (1952b: 307-29; 1965b:50-l), Talgai (1965b:46-50; 1967b:95-7) and Keilor (1965b:41-6) crania. In the case of Talgai he followed up by making ten excursions to the area to gather local knowledge or reminiscences, and to evaluate the geographical and geological context. Bulldozed trenches and multiple core drillings were used. And as for Cohuna: those of us who heard Mac's Presidential Address to the Anthrop- ological Society of New South Wales in 1951, and later read it (1952b), not only recognized his facility in searching out material and arranging it in historical or logical order as required: we also realized that an anthropologist of outstanding promise had come on the scene, and one who had the gift of presenting his findings in an intriguing manner, as the conclusion to the above address illustrates:</page><page sequence="8">90 Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK The spiritual vicissitudes of the cranium in the controversy, polemics and fantasy of press-reporting and its unhappy linkage with the Jervois specimen are equalled by its physical misfortunes. Apart from its underground experiences of earth pressure leading to distortion, and possible traumatic attack by recent Aborigines and a ploughscoop, it sustained the activities of cast makers, the amputation for chemical analysis, of a valuable anatomical landmark (the inion), and a partial dislocation by water. Originally introduced as pre-Pithecanthropian and then reduced to mediocre modernity, it seems to earn, if not deserve, a little prestige. In any case, should it prove to be absolutely recent, it still has intrinsic worth in demonstrating persistence in present-day Aborigines, of the outlandish phenotype with a more primitive morphology in massive facial skeleton and teeth, extremely narrow diameter between the temporal surfaces of the frontais, and marked dolichocephaly combined with a large cranial capacity ( 1952b :328). In an earlier address, given to the Anthropology Section of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science in Hobart in 1949 (1949c: 123-44), Mac had shown his ability and tenacity to follow the thread of a problem through a maze of records, opinions and data, controlled by his own carefully noted personal observations and inquiries. In this case he used the knowledge he had gained through experience at sea and through specific inquiry about winds and currents, weather and visibility so as to determine the possible sea-routes the Tasmanian Aborigines could have followed in the primitive craft available to them. In 1949 and the preceding decades a sea-crossing was understood to have been unavoidable, from the south coast of the continent, or down some part of its eastern coast and then across the strait, or perhaps from the New Hebrides where a people of Tasmanoid type seemed to exist. Macintosh, however, thought that many anthropological theories ignoring the effects of wind and current, had "postulated purposeful waves of migration in the teeth of both" (1949c: 123). His paper, therefore, was in his own words "a survey of what appears possible and what does not appear possible". Later on, when geological and archaeological data showed that the Aborigines were in Tasmania before it was separated from the mainland, and a sea-route was no longer essential to explain their being on it, Macintosh's analysis of the material was not wasted effort: especially his masterly summary of the possibilities allowed by prevailing currents and winds. A crossing from the southern shores of the continent was apparently impossible - though the reverse journey was possible. But a curvilinear voyage from the New Hebrides to Tasmania was theoretically possible (1949c: 141), even though requiring from 50 to 80 days. Moreover, he showed from the literature that the Tasmanian craft were "more varied and more capable of sea worthiness than is generally supposed". The significance of this paper lies not only in its substance but in the fact that he prepared it 30 years ago. In it he referred also to the racial constitution of the Australian Aborigines, and emphasized our meagre knowledge at the time of "skull form in mixed peoples". In later</page><page sequence="9">Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK 91 years, however, he did much to dispel this ignorance by research in which he was helped by S. L. Larnach (1966, 1970a, 1971b, 1972b, 1973, 1976:115-6). Technical Flare Macintosh had the double gift of technical efficiency and improvization, - an essential gift when recovering and "developing" bones in varying phases and conditions of fossilization or of disintegration, - a gift which included a patient spirit as well as a steady hand. An example of his ability to deal with such practical problems appears in his important paper, "Fossil Man in Australia", (1967b: 86-98). Under the leadership of Mr. Dermot A. Casey, a devoted Honorary Associate in Anthropology at the National Museum of Victoria, and with the oversight of a controlling and co-ordinating group of specialists, human bones were excavated in 1965 at Green Gully "in the upper part of the same Keilor Terrace" in which the Keilor cranium had been found in 1940. An adequate record of each stage of the excavation was made in notes and diagrams, by "scale measurements of levels and surveys", and by photo- graphy. Mac who was overseas during 1965 and early 1966, agreed to attempt "extraction from matrix, identification, and reconstruction of the bones". He received the bones, field photographs and press cuttings on 6th April, 1966. Such was his reputation. As the bones were fragile, the field workers painted them with a strengthening solution of bedacryl in acetone and pasted over them several layers of tissue paper to protect them from "the plaster of Paris used for reinforcement". Unfortunately the plaster of Paris (surgical bandages) which had been moulded to the shapes of the bones, shrank when dry and tightly compressed the underlying layers of tissue paper, the bedacryl and the clayey matrix "into a compound which was not soluble in any of a number of reagents tried". In addition this compound had in some places "firmly bound itself to the sub-periosteal basal lamina of the bone which scaled off under the least traction, thereafter defying identification" (ibid. 88). There indeed was a challenge. Mac and his technical staff spent much time experimenting before starting to extract the bones from the matrix, and indeed continued to experiment and modify technique until the last piece of bone had been removed on 2nd January 1967, that is, almost nine months later. The challenge was met by using a one-centimetre traverse oscillating saw, mounted in a pistol grip and electrically driven, to fenestrate the plaster of Paris; the frames of these scores of small windows were then in turn cut through, and so pressure or wrenching effects on the underlying bones were avoided. It was ultimately found that 40% xylol in acetone would convert the compound of clag-bedacryl-matrix to a latex or chewing gum-like consistency, which could then be teased up with forceps and dissected off the bones; some dozens of Howard-Parker detachable blades were used up in this work.</page><page sequence="10">92 Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK But other difficulties were seen when the coverings had been removed. Thus a gap of 7.0 χ 2.3 cm existed at the upper end of the shaft involving the region of the bicipital groove. Bone from this gap was adherent as a mosaic of chips to the inner aspect of the applied bedacryl-clag-matrix. This area of wrappings was trimmed with scissors, laid on a broad spatula, supported around its margins so that the chips could not float away or otherwise disperse from one another, and the whole immersed in a lidded tray with a shallow (1.0cm) depth of acetone and xylol. After 24 hours, each chip was separately removed in turn and joined progressively to its neighbouring chip. Had the chips become dispersed, adjacent margins could not have been identified correctly. As it was, the gap in the shaft was completely restored by reassembling the 13 fragments ranging in size from 0.3 χ 0.6 cm to 4.3 χ 1.3 cm (ibid. 88). And so the story went on. Thus, three transverse fractures of the shaft of the humérus had become welded together by a very hard carbonate crust 1.0 to 4.0 mm thick. This was drilled away with steel dental drills after it had been soaked with dilute acetic acid. "The cleaned bone edges then provided perfect alignment." Apparently the cracks which the carbonate had invaded, were post-mortem. They were therefore, one clue that the burial had been a delayed rite.1 For further details of the immensity of the task so ably accomplished by Mac and his team, readers should read the article. I cannot refrain, however, from noting that the Green Gully bone fragments numbered 3,900, whereas a normal skeleton consists of 236 bones. No wonder he wrote that the task of identification was severe. Indeed, "only 730 could be identified and used for reassemblage". After many experiments, these were hardened by immersion "in 25% bedacryl in xylol, or in Tarzan's Grip q.s. in acetone, under vacuum for 24 to 48 hours". They "were then photographed separately and life-size prints were stuck down on a panel pari passu with the reassemblage of the fragments themselves by adhesive" (ibid. 91). The result showed that the 730 pieces amounted to only two-fifths of a total skeleton. The other fragments were sent to various institutions for testing. A collagen C-14 date of 6460 ±190 years was given by Athol Rafter, N.Z. (R.1904/2). I have referred to the Green Gully project mainly to emphasize the technical ingenuity and persistence of Professor Macintosh and his team.2 It also reveals 1 Several years later, January 1971, a mandible from the 22,000 to 24,000 B.P. levels of the Tabon Cave in Palawan, Philippines, was handed to Macintosh "to be cleared of crust and morphologically analysed". As the crust proved to be practically pure guano, "it had to be removed entirely by electric diamond drills under magnification. As the bone was extremely fragile", much care and time were required. Another quiet understatement (1974a:89). a Messrs. B. Bailey and S. L. Laraach (bone preparation and identification) , G. Williams (photography), K. Parsons (replicas and chemicals) and P. Mills (drawings, panel, etc.) (1967b:92).</page><page sequence="11">Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK 93 his interpretative insight, incomparable anatomical knowledge, and the value of his forensic experience. He quickly recognized that bones from two individuals were represented in the "burial", that for example "the right humérus and the left humeral shaft" were from two individuals, and finally that the latter together with the bones of the two lower extremities suggested male sex, whereas the rest, including the skull were female. In this decision he was supported by Professor D. V. Davies of Anatomy at St. Thomas's Hospital, London, and Professor S. Sunderland, of Anatomy, the University of Melbourne, who visited Sydney in July and August 1966 respectively. One interesting and possibly extraordinary aspect of this assemblage of bones was that no bone in it was duplicated, as though they all belonged to one individual. Whereas, "the assessed male bones form a block consisting of lower extremities, probably pelvis, and left upper extremity", the "assessed female bones form a unit of head and neck, thorax, right upper extremity, and both shoulder girdles" . . . After drawing attention to other features of the collection of bones, Macintosh wrote that the only explanation of this strange circumstance was the exposure of the two bodies near one another, followed by "delayed burial" (interment) after nature and predators had reduced the bodies to bones, some parts being carried or moved away. Exposure of bodies followed by "delayed burial" which was observed by early white settlers, was presumably an ancient practice. Mac's view in this case was that when the mourners of that long past time came to inter the bones, they gathered up and put into one grave about two- thirds of the female and one third of the male, and did so accidentally. At this point he drew on his forensic experience. The Sydney police had brought to him from time to time "remains of individuals who had died of exposure on the western plains, or ... in the Hawkesbury scrub". In one case in which only the two arms remained, the rest "apparently having been dispersed by crows, hawks, or eagles, the proximal bones ended in oblique fracture lines, not unlike that at the proximal end of the Green Gully left humeral shaft" (ibid. 94). Mac then visualized the Green Gully mourners coming to inter one of the deceased, selected and arranged "the remains of one individual from the partly separated and scattered remains of two individuals, and not being anatomists they got the limbs mixed". The bones of the separated portions might well have been "maintained in loose relationship by air-mummified tendons and ligaments". And though such visualizations might sound contrived, their occurrence was "relatively commonplace in forensic experience" (ibid. 94). In this same paper (1967b) Professor Macintosh related the Green Gully find to other Australian fossil finds. He placed it with Keilor and probably Tartanga in one group as distinct from Cohuna, Talgai and Mossgiel. The former group is marked for example by a "full curved frontal bone, . . . well- filled vault . . . orthognathism and moderate palate and tooth size", whereas the</page><page sequence="12">94 Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK latter exhibits an "almost flat markedly receding frontal vault, overall narrowness of cranial vault . . . obvious prognathism, large palate and teeth" (ibid. 93, 97). Further, Macintosh assisted by Larnach attempted to estimate the morphological status of the foregoing Aboriginal fossil relics, using a formula they had "statistically evolved", representing 23 cranial anatomical characters by a number value. They had applied this procedure to assess the morphology of Aboriginal skulls from coastal New South Wales (1966). The range for females was 33 to 50, and for males 44 to 60. Using the same criteria the average Tasmanian value was 42, Green Gully 43, Talgai (juvenile) 46, Keilor 49, Cohuna 55 and Mossgiel 55.5. This was surprising, "for all fit within a normal distribution". "Presumably constant gene flow has obliterated type boundaries", and therefore, "the subjective impression of two separate types is not confirmed by this type of analysis" (ibid. 97). This unexpected result led Macintosh to apply the same formula to Homo erectus and Solo Man; he found that they fell outside the maximum coastal Aboriginal values. Not being able to follow this inquiry further, he concluded the article as follows: The obvious requirement is to look forward to new data with excitement and anticipation and to welcome any revisions which may become necessary. Seven years later, after applying the same "morphological formula" (statistical analysis) to the skulls of North Queensland Aborigines (1970a), Eastern Australian Aborigines (1971b) and the Keppel Islanders (1972b), Mac wrote that the range of values for all these skulls was practically identical and "separated them completely from Mongoloid and Caucasoid crania". He added that no Negritic component was found in the Cairns Rain Forest skulls. Further, having "demonstrated a north to south cranial cline from Cape York to the New South Wales coast", he retracted his statement of 1965 that he could not see a physical relationship between Australian and New Guiñean populations (1973:1). As a result of the work of Larnach and himself, he believed that no Australian fossil skull fell outside the range they had established for their, then, recent series (1974a: 84, 85). Moreover, following personal discussion with Graeme Pretty, he considered that the remarkable excavations by the latter and his team at Roonka, South Australia, would bear this out for the period 18,000 to 4,000 B.P. Considering the absence of date processing for dozens of samples, and the large amount of unpublished material by many workers, reviewing prehistoric man in Australia is hardly possible. Therefore he decided to state the findings of himself and his fellow workers, and let the future decide their significance. Amongst these, are, the reduction of the differentiating pattern of H. erectus to three traits "which are completely diagnostic"; an occipital torus occurs in 90% of Australian Aboriginal skulls though 70.3% have no trace of an external occipital protruberance; apparent contour similarities are of less significance than</page><page sequence="13">Ν.

Mac summed up this excellent contribution to the Grafton Elliot Smith commemoration symposium in true scholarly fashion: I have tried to write this paper as a journal of endeavours to follow a variety of pathways, some based on the earlier and current work of others, some on my own earlier and current thinking and data. Some of my pathways proved to be misleading and have had to be abandoned; some have needed partial re-tracing; some remain obscure (1974a: 92). Before passing from Mac's technical and interpretative achievement with the Green Gully bones, I draw attention to the corollary which arose from it: his contribution on "The Recovery and Treatment of Bone" in Australian Archaeology: A Guide to Field and Laboratory Techniques (1968:175-191). Its main theme is two-sided, first to refrain from any form of field treatment of human material and its matrix, and second, to remove the remains in their natural matrix either as a whole, or in blocks, each sealed in a polythene bag. Such is the message from one who was technician, archaeologist and anatomist and whose outstanding ability as anthropologist-anatomist as well as expert in developing bone from its matrix was acknowledged increasingly throughout Australia and abroad. The Talgai Cranium Discovery and Exhibition The one and only meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science held in Australia took place in the several capital cities from Perth to Brisbane in August 1914. At a Sydney session on the 21st August Professors Edgeworth David of Geology and J. T. Wilson of Anatomy exhibited a fossilized human cranium. It had been found in 1886 by a fencing contractor, William Naish who saw and extracted it from the north bank of the billabong about 477 metres from Dalrymple Creek on part of the then East Talgai pastoral property, near Warwick, south-eastern Queensland. Flash flooding which had cut into the bank, exposed it in "a nodule-bearing brown stratum about three feet from the bottom". Naish had given the cranium to Mr. G. J. E. Clark, owner of the station, from whom it passed a few years later to his niece's husband, Ε. Η. Κ. Crawford, Manager of a succession of properties, including Waterloo Station, northern N.S.W. in 1895-98. In 1896 the latter made inquiries about its pecuniary value both through his brother, a medical student in England, and from the British Museum, and also through Turner and Henderson, Stationers of Hunter</page><page sequence="16">96 Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK Street, Sydney. The latter submitted it to the Curator and Trustees of the Australian Museum, Sydney. The Curator, Mr. R. Etheridge, judging from the calcareous sinter covering the fossil, thought it came either from "a swamp or spring deposit". The Trustees at a meeting on the 6th October, 1896, which according to the minutes, included Professors David and Wilson, expressed interest in buying it and asked Mr. Crawford "what sum he asked for it". The correspondence between the Museum and Mr. Crawford ceased in November, with the latter not sensing a satisfactory market. Moreover, he was apparently vague and misinformed about the circumstances, site and time of discovery, thus underlining Mr. Etheridge's statement that as the specimen did not possess "geological history, its value was comparatively small from a geological standpoint", while its osteological value was "still less" because all the characters were hidden by sinter (1969b: 1 92-5 ).3 And so the Museum Trustees, including the Professors of Geology and Anatomy, and the Curator lost interest in Talgai, and apparently forgot about it. Indeed, 20 years later, Mr. Etheridge told Professor David in a letter (15th July, 1916) that the whole affair had slipped his memory (ibid. 192). Eighteen years after Mr. Crawford's failure to get what he regarded as "full value" for the object, he tried again, this time by writing to Professor David on 1st April, 1914, with a view to having it valued and sold. Following correspondence, Crawford posted it to David on 23rd July, and on the 25th, sent the crowns of two teeth broken off the cranium. About 10 days later, Crawford wrote on 5th August agreeing to Professor Wilson's request to make a limited test to see if bone existed under the crust. From examination of photographs and casts taken at the time, Macintosh concluded that Wilson had scaled off a piece of crust over the left frontal bone. Wilson, indeed, examined the specimen minutely and obtained dioptographic tracings. Dr. S. A. Smith, Acting Professor of Anatomy during Wilson's absence on war service from October 1914, made a detailed study of the cranium for publication. He noted that the bone4 surface was bare in a few small areas in the frontal region only, having, he thought, but mistakenly, been accidentally chipped off. The cranium remained with David until after the Science Congress, though as Macintosh writes, Crawford "naturally refused permission for prior removal of encrustation or sectioning" before sale (1965b: 47). Shortly after the Congress, however, David received a letter from Crawford on 3rd September 3 The references to the Talgai cranium in 1896 were found by Dr. Alex Ritchie, Curator of Fossils at the Australian Museum, in the Museum Archives, and made available to Professor Macintosh. This was in 1969, after the latter had thought he had come to the end of all archival or other printed or written material regarding the adventures of the Talgai cranium. 4S. A. Smith.

MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK 97 asking for the return of the cranium. Crawford, upset by incorrect press reports on the exhibition of the specimen at the Congress, felt he was not being fairly treated by David and Wilson. One report stated that the two scientists had found it, another that they got it from a stockman, and another that it was "worth its weight in gold". David replied tactfully, explaining how reporters hurrying from one of the 12 scientific sections of the Congress to another, only heard snippets of the papers being read and so made mistakes. Further, until his return from Brisbane and Talgai and after writing to Mr. Crawford on the 3rd September, he had not seen the relevant copies of the newspapers. Had he done so: I would not only have acknowledged your courtesy in allowing us to exhibit the skull, as I did in my letter to the Telegraph' of September the 2nd instant published on September the 3rd, but would also have publicly (expressed) my regret at any misstatement having appeared which should cause you disappointment or annoyance.5 Professor David's communication to the Daily Telegraph on 2nd September, 1914, was used in the next day's Leader under the heading TALGAI SKULL. The following extract expresses David's frank acknowledgement of Mr. Crawford's role in the incident: The skull, he said, was at present the property of Mr. Ε. Η. Κ. Crawford, of Deyrah, Greenethorpe, N. S. W. and it was by his courtesy that it was exhibited to the members of the association. Mr. Crawford had informed him that it had been discovered as long as 30 years ago at Talgai station near Warwick, Queensland, by one of the workmen on the station, who was putting up some fences: "As so much of the scientific interest attaching to the skull depends on the formation in which it was originally discovered", proceeded the professor, "it was of great importance to find the man who was the original discoverer. Through the kindness of Mr. George Clark, the present owner of East Talgai station, and Mr. H. W. Walcott of Warwick, I was able to trace Mr. W. Naish, the original discoverer, now 76 years of age, and much enfeebled through rheumatism, who is living at the township of Allora. In the meantime, in case negotiations failed, an emergency rush job was done: a photographic record of "12 various views of the encrusted cranium" was made on the 3rd and 4th of the same month. Moreover between 7th and 13th September at Wilson's request a mould for casting the cranium was made at the Australian Museum, and the "skull" was ready to be returned. However, negotiations with Mr. Crawford were successful and the University of Sydney purchased the cranium for £150 on the 26th October, thanks to an ad hoc donation from Mr. (later Sir) Joynton Smith, M.L.C., Lord Mayor of Sydney and successful business man, founder of Smith's Weekly. To help him in the negotiations, David sought the opinions of visiting anthropologists, in particular that of G. Elliot Smith, who having carefully B Letter from Professor David to Ε. Η. Κ. Crawford, September 1914.</page><page sequence="18">98 Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK examined the skull wrote the following interesting letter to Mr. J. A. Minnett who was acting for Mr. Crawford: September 17th, 1914 Professor David has consulted me as to the proper price which should be paid for the ancient skull found in the Darling Downs. During the last few years I have had occasion to make myself familiar with all the transactions which have been conducted in Europe and America for the purchase of ancient human remains; and I have no hesitation in saying that the sum of £100 would be a generous estimate of the market value of the specimen in question. Taking into consideration the history of the Darling Downs specimen, I very much doubt whether anyone on the other side of the world would be willing to give so large a sum for a specimen which was not seen in situ by a scientific observer. I am, Yours sincerely, (signed) G. Elliot Smith &lt;* Probably the communication to the Anthropological Section which will be regarded as of greatest importance was the exposition by Professors David and Wilson, at Sydney, of the highly mineralized skull of an Australian man, probably of Pleistocene date. This skull "shows certain features in common with that of the Sussex Piltdown skull". Such was the reference in the report of the Narrative and Itinerary of the British Association Congress of 1914, to the Talgai announcement - an announcement which aroused much enthusiasm amongst visiting overseas anthro- pologists, especially Von Luschan, Elliot Smith and Solías. And no wonder! This was the first human relic which geologically and morphologically bore witness to truly ancient, probably Pleistocene, man in Australia. Professor Wilson's presentation was very perceptive; as the reporter put it, "the discovery . . . took everyone by surprise. Professor Wilson lifted the skull - a rough, iron-coloured, and encrusted thing, that in its centuries of burial had been almost turned to stone - and showed it to the packed roomful. He turned the thing over in his hands; it was smallish, elongated, and flattened a little out of shape. He pointed out the signs of its primitiveness, and at the same time of its "Australianity", if one may make a word. He showed that from the state of the teeth the skull would probably be that of a boy 14 or 15. Fossil encrustation had so grown over it hiding, and in some cases actually replacing, the structure of the original bone, that it was hard to be sure of measurements. But, at any rate, the skull was extremely prognathous, and its brain capacity must have been extremely small. Also, the dog teeth stuck out like tusks. Though the examination and measurements are by no means complete as yet, "there can be no question", said Prof. Wilson, that this is more interesting than any human remains yet discovered in Australia. It may rank with some of the more important historical finds elsewhere. Indeed, its discovery would seem to place the entire question of the early existence of man upon this continent upon an entirely new basis (Daily Telegraph, August 22, 1914). •From the Archives Department of Anatomy, University of Sydney. This letter reflects Elliot Smith's active part in anthropological affairs abroad in the early part of this century.</page><page sequence="19">Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK 99 Professor David followed "and amid applause and excitement told of the finding of the skull". I had attended his geology lectures in 1912, and still remember his occasional spontaneous orations, which supplanted the expected lectures, on soul stirring events such as the Sinking of the Titanic; and I heard him in beautifully modulated voice accompanied by bows and other gestures introducing a distinguished Japanese geologist at a Pacific Science Congress in 1923; indeed the public addresses of this natural Welsh orator nearly always became opportunities for him to let himself go. So even now, after 64 years have gone by, I can sense the atmosphere of revelation in which David developed the Talgai mystery through the circumstances of the discovery to his own part in obtaining the specimen from Mr. Crawford for examination by Professor Wilson and himself and for showing to Congress members, and finally to the probable existence of the Talgai youth at the same time as the now (1914) long extinct giant marsupials roamed the Darling Downs in the Pleistocene age, say, 25,000 years ago; in the Kosciusko age, the great Ice age. At any rate, there was no doubt of the considerable geological antiquity of the skull - that it was far older than any other human remains found in this country. "Now", Professor David concluded, "if we are asked, Is man a geological antiquity in Australia?' we can reply. 'Yes, he is.' " Great was the applause that followed; and then Professor G. Elliot Smith, Australian scientist of world renown, kept the enthusiasm high by suggesting that the discovery would prove the most momentous feature of the Australian meeting "moving, as it did, the history of man in this country, and of navigation, too, back to a period so remote". The reference to navigation was an example of his remarkable instant insight into the significant relationship of facts and events. Navigation in the Pleistocene! Amidst the enthusiasm, David emphasized that the exact age of Talgai could not be determined until further evidence was obtained. Neither he nor any other scientist had been to the place of discovery. David, however, filled in this blank by visiting Talgai during the Brisbane Session of the Congress. Sunday, 30th August, was a 'free' day. Going by train from Brisbane on the 29th to Talgai (now Ellenthorp) Siding, he stayed at the Clark homestead, and spent the next afternoon at the site. Mr. Naish, the discoverer of the specimen, a cripple in 1914, was carried from the car by two persons, one of whom, Charlie Fraser, guided Professor Macintosh to the spot in 1967, when retracing Professor David's steps. Naish got his bearings from two wide gate posts he had put up "about 30 years before" 1914, and showed David where he had found the relic. David made notes, sketches and took measurements. The upshot was in the opinion of Professor Macintosh who has studied them, that David "was in no real doubt as to the genuineness of provenance" (1965b: 48). And so, the Recorder of the Congress added to his report on the com- munication about the Talgai cranium, that David "was fortunately able, on</page><page sequence="20">100 Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK an excursion subsequent to the (Sydney) Meeting, to find the original discoverer of the skull and obtain exact particulars as to the locality and mode of occurrence" {Report of Congress, p. 717). The likeness in certain features to Piltdown, mentioned in the Report of the Recorder, R. R. Marett, ethnologist, probably reflected an observation by Professor Grafton Elliot Smith at the meeting. The latter had published in the previous year, 1913, four papers on the Piltdown cranium and its reconstruction in which he played a lively part. In addition, he discussed both Talgai and Piltdown among other remains of primitive man at a Congress public lecture in the Sydney Town Hall in the evening of that same 'momentous' day. His brother, Acting Professor S. A. Smith, for whom the cranium was divided and cleaned, described and interpreted it between October 1914 and July 1916 when he sent his report to the Royal Society of London. Criticisms have been made of individual points in his interpretations, especially of certain teeth, and being neither geologist nor archivist, he was non-committal about the age of the specimen, but his anatomical findings were clear and firm: the cranium was of a male, aged 14 to 16, and presented a collection of primitive features identifying it as ua primitive proto- Australian" (1965b: 48). In Essays on the Evolution of Man (1924, 2nd edition 1927), Elliot Smith naturally referred to Talgai. He had seen the 'undeveloped' relic at the Congress session in Sydney in August 1914, and as already mentioned, he had examined it carefully in September 1914 when assessing its market value. In addition, a cast made after it was cleaned, had been sent to him in September 1916, in Manchester where he was Professor of Anatomy (1969b: 192). He would, no doubt, have had it by him while reading S. A. Smith's report which he later communicated to the Royal Society of London. Of the Talgai skull he wrote in these Essays that it was "the fossilized remains of the earliest aboriginal Australian so far discovered, that although completely mineralized, there was no reason for assuming that it was more than a few thousand years old; "even if as seems not improbable, men of this proto-Australian type reached Australia while the now extinct gigantic Marsupials were still living, that would not necessarily imply any great antiquity" (p. 129). More important, however, was his judgment that the cranium conformed to the Australian racial type, while being at the same time "remarkable for the enormous size of its palate and teeth (especially the salient canine teeth)", and all the more so as it was the cranium of an adolescent boy (p. 130). But although Elliot Smith also discussed the Piltdown cranium in this book, he did not compare it with Talgai. Arthur Keith, however, in The Antiquity of Man (2nd edition, 1925; 448-57) summarizes the discovery, the site and main features of the cranium, paying especial attention to the palate. He considers that "in size and shape</page><page sequence="21">Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK 101 the Talgai palate is the most anthropoid ever seen in a human skull", but it probably stands below the Piltdown palate in these respects. The width is less than the length and so differs from Rhodesian, Wadjak and Neanderthal skulls. Moreover, the former and the Wadjak palates have the horseshoe or human shape, while the Talgai lad had one with almost parallel sides - that is, anthropoidal in type (ibid. 452-3), a feature of the arrangement of the pre-molars and molars in the Piltdown palate (ibid. 653, 655). However, the Talgai canines are "altogether human". In his unpublished Diploma of Anthropology Thesis (1950:5) Macintosh noted that Professor A. N. Burkitt "developed" the third molars. This showed "the molar lines incurved posteriorly and the angling of the canines rounded off". But in spite of this and other modifications, resulting from "development", the Talgai palate "is still very large, being longer than the modern Aboriginal palate"; and "the canines are probaly not equalled in total dimensions" by those of any modern Australian Aborigines: and Talgai was only a 16 years old male! Otherwise "no single feature is unique when compared with" recent Aborigines (ibid. 7), "but the total of the facial, palatal and tooth characters presents a combination of features suggesting that early man in Australia had a more primitive genetic constitution than that of the modern Australian Aboriginal." Hellman7 had already shown that S. A. Smith did not take into account fractures of the jaw and palate. After elimination of those and reconstruction of the palate the cast of which Hellman had cut into sections, the result was a "remarkable resemblance in form of palate" to modern Australian Aboriginal (1952f:106, 1969b: 190). Moreover, Macintosh himself and Dr. T. D. Campbell of Adelaide in 1952 remeasured the teeth after which he reconstituted the dental arch, "based on a study of the interproximal attrition". In the result S. A. Smith's parallelism of the molar-premolar series disappeared, and the palate was horseshoe in shape, though "not nearly to the degree of Keilor" (1952f: 106-9, 1965b:49). On the Talgai Trail The anatomical features and the general morphology of the Talgai fossilized cranium, by decisively indicating antiquity, called for research and interpretation. But as Etheridge in 1896 and Elliot Smith and others in 1914 had emphasized, the absence of geological history, and even of knowledge of the exact position in which the specimen was found, took away from its value. This fact was reflected in loss of interest in the cranium itself. Its first description was not prepared until 30 years after its amateur-accidental discovery, and did not appear until about the end of World War I. Moreover, its writer, Dr. S. A. 7M. Hellman (1934), "The Form of the Talgai Palate", Amer. J. Phys. Anth., 19: 1-15.</page><page sequence="22">102 Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK Smith stressed doubt as to its geological and historical bona fides. Moreover, great interest and activity were aroused in the decade after the War by several new and significant finds, which were described and discussed both in scientific journals and also in newspapers and in general magazines such as the Illustrated London News.8 These finds included in 1921 a cranium and other bones of Rhodesian man in a cave at Broken Hill, Northern Rhodesia; the Cohuna cranium in northern Victoria, Australia, in 1925; in the same year the first Australopithecus - found in Bechuanaland by Professor Raymond Dart of Johannesburg, a graduate of the University of Sydney; from 1929 onwards, the remains of over 30 individuals of a type at first called Sinanthropus pekinensis, or Peking Man, but now Homo erectus pekinensis, and various discoveries in the Old World. The Piltdown reconstruction controversy still simmered on. Talgai could not compete, as it were, against these other relics of modern man's ancestors. In addition, it could not find a secure place in man's evolutionary tree, in his prehistory, without its own geological locus being established. An observation in the Sydney Morning Herald, August 22, 1914 put the point positively: If the Pleistocene age of the skull can be established, it will rank in importance with the famous skulls of Neanderthal and Spy. Realizing this, and to restore the reputation of the cranium, Macintosh felt that it needed a genuine history: First, every incident relating to its discovery and subsequent adventures needed to be sought and totally substantiated. Secondly, the locus from which it came would have to be rediscovered on the basis of David's notes and the stratum tested for similarity with the composition and colour of the cranium itself and its crust. If these proved convincing, it would be reasonable to spend time and effort in reassessing the anatomy of the cranium; but this would involve taking the cranium apart at its lines of fracture, removing the intervening crust, and reassembling the fragments in edge-edge apposition - a daunting task (1969b: 190). With this goal, he set out to "rediscover" the cranium, to find and follow the Talgai trail. And what an intriguing story it is! Perhaps with Mrs. Macintosh's help it could be written up. In Mac's opinion it is the most fascinating of the Australian fossil relics; first, because of its romantic history involving its dramatic scientific acclaim in 1914, its subsequent scientific down-grading, and its gradual restoration since 1963 to significant status. Secondly, for the participants at least, the detective work that has been involved rivals in interest the most complicated police investigations on record: false trails, destroyed evidence, conflicting testimony and data, have confronted one in every facet of the investigation (1967c: 113). 8 Members of my own University Tutorial and Workers Education Association class in 1923-25 kept themselves and me informed through avidly reading this second group of publications.</page><page sequence="23">Ν.

MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK 103 As a result of searching for and reading archival material between 1948 and 1962, Professor Macintosh thought that in spite of discrepancies, the information was sufficient to identify the site of discovery by William Naish in the mid-1 880's, provided he could "find a local contact who knew the area and circumstances well enough to guide him within range". He was thinking of a descendant of Mr. Naish or "someone who had been associated with Professor David's brief visit to the site in August 1914". Other possibilities also occurred to him (ibid. 113-5). And then the miracle happened: In July 1960, the skull and a portion of a skeleton found at Mossgiel in south-western New South Wales, was brought to Macintosh in the Department of Anatomy, University of Sydney, by J. Brough Gibson, President of the Hay Historical Society. This skull and skeleton proved of great interest with its suggestions, though only such, of Homo soloensis, but no relationship was claimed (1965b: 51-2, 1967b: 95). Field work on it was ended, when Mr. Gibson's wife's sister, Miss C. F. Morgan of Tannymorel, Queensland, asked Mac why he didn't investigate the Talgai area. After explaining the kind of contact he wanted, she explained that her other sister's husband's mother's cousin was Mrs. Thelma Cowley, a grand-daughter of William Naish; that her husband Jack Cowley had bought his farm from Septimus Suttor, and that some people thought the skull was found somewhere on that farm.

W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK region while he himself looked for "local people, archives and traditions". They met the Cowleys who introduced a host of relevant contacts; showed them a "presumptive site", and also the survey map of the immediate region drawn for the Scottish Australian Investment Company's sale in 1912 of Talgai West sub-divisions: on this the fences erected by Naish in the mid-1 880's and which were still standing in 1912, were indicated by broken lines. What a great start to the search! But it was only a start. About 50 people helped Mac with what they knew or thought they knew about the site, the discovery, and Professor David's visit in 1914. The "presumptive site" was but one of about 14 which were suggested and all had to be, and were, tracked back to their origins. The trails with one exception were oral trans- missions from one person to another and to another and so on. The exception was Charles Fraser, for he alone remained of the five who had actually seen the site: the others were William Naish (the discoverer), Professor David, Jack Murdoch of Warwick (who drove David) and E. Hockings who opened the gates and also helped Fraser carry Naish from the car to the cranium site. The significant and essential figure on the trail was Charles Fraser: he was an employee of Septimus Suttor who in 1914 owned the sub-division farm on which according to one tradition the skull was found; and this was the farm which Jack Cowley bought on Suttor's retirement. Actually the site of discovery turned out to be on the adjoining farm held by Len Weier. In any case, we get back to Miss C. F. Morgan. No wonder Mac put her first on his list of acknowledgements, as "the most important single contributor to the Talgai investigation, because without her perceptive comment in Hay, the search would probably never have started at all" (1967c: 115). In addition, it was from that start, through her Cowley relations, that the trail led after entering many side-tracks, to Mr. Septimus Suitor, through whom it passed on to one of his employees, Peter Webber of Warwick; from the latter it led to Charlie Fraser, who helped him pull up the two wide gate posts on Naish's fence; and then another marvellous flash, the result of the spreading interest in Mac's search: At this stage, Charles Fraser of Warwick rang me to say that his father, Charles Fraser of Pratten, was the man who (with another now dead) had carried Naish to the cranium site for Professor David in 1914. The long search for a direct first-hand eye witness to Naish's identification of the site was over (1967c: 120). Confusing the Trail In his archival search, Mac came across in the Department of Geology, University of Sydney, David's summarized account of his visit to the Talgai cranium site on August 30, 1914, guided by W. Naish. The latter "pointed out an old storm water channel of the nature of a billabong and nearly a quarter of a mile distant from the main creek (Dalrymple) as the scene of discovery".</page><page sequence="27">Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK 105 In a severe flood about 1884 (?) a "new billabong had been washed out of the alluvials to a depth of about 10 feet", and after the waters had gone down, Naish saw the skull "not lying at the bottom of the wash out which is about 20 to 25 yards in width, buí somewhat up the slope of one of the sides . . . lying among some whitish lumps like pebbles with very rough surfaces". These were nodules of earthy lime. Having studied the David papers, Mac thought, as stated above, he would recognize the approximate site if taken to its vicinity. But when Jack Cowley pointed out to him in April, 1963 the place of discovery, as he, Jack Cowley, had received the story, Mac could hardly believe that success had come so quickly; at the same time, however, he was puzzled because he appeared "to be standing merely in the middle of a very large paddock of uniform surface", very different from the scene of discovery as described by David. However, instead of looking at once for a site more like the David-Naish one, Mac, quite understandably, listened to explanations of how the surface of the paddock had changed since David's visit 50 years before: Following the subdivision, farmers had ploughed in and levelled scours, gullies and depressions to increase the crop-bearing areas. But, no informants thought that the depression was ever more than four feet deep; that is, "much silting up had occurred naturally between 1884 and 1912" (1967c: 115-16). And yet, writes Mac, "there was the obvious objection that when David visited the site with Naish in 1914, while shape, i.e. slope of banks, had altered, dimensions of the billabong were quoted much as they had been in 1884-6" (ibid: 116). No wonder Mac wrote in 1967, with his usual frankness, that it seemed incredible that Gill and himself should not have noticed this "point" and instead concentrated their attention on the relationship of the Naish fence to the cranium site, an enigma which proved intractable for three years. It was indeed only an assumption that after the flood of 1884 (1886?) subsided, Naish, being the fencer, went into the storm gully near where his new fence crossed it, and there found the cranium. And this ! in spite of the Scottish Australian Investment Company's 1912 survey map not showing the fence crossing the depression at all! Further, in 1964 Mac and Gill visited Mr. Suttor, then in Emma ville, northern New South Wales, previously owner of Cowley's farm, who quoted (from his papers), and Mac wrote down: the "distance of the Naish fence from the creek throughout its length". But says Mac (ibid. 119), again quite frankly, "it took me two years to see" the clue Suttor gave me. When he did recognize this, Mac examined closely the 1912 survey map and saw two bends in the fence. Local people whom he questioned on his next trip to Warwick confirmed Suttor's statement. So, with his usual thoroughness, he had a "detailed and meticulously accurate map made of the crucial region . . . from a combination of aerial photographs traced stereoscopically, combined with parish and military maps and measurements over the ground". Result: the Naish fence did not</page><page sequence="28">106 Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK cross any gully at all (ibid. 120). Naish himself, however, always crossed the billabong on his way from his home in Allora via Adam Bott's farm to the fence.9 (Fig. 2). Next, Mac sought the man who pulled up the Naish fence. Suttor's list of former employees included Peter Webber of Warwick, aged 78 in 1967, who asserted that he had done so in 1916, and that the 1912 map was correct. He named three others who would, and did, confirm his statement.

He had helped Webber pull up the two wide gate posts, which Mac learned later were Naish's guide posts to the cranium site when directing Professor David thither in 1914. And then as I stated above, Mac was put in touch with Fraser who came from Pratten and "without hesitation" followed the Naish-David trail, by way of the former position of the two wide gate posts and so to the site marked Β on the map (Fig. 2). Moreover, he insisted that site A (J. Cowley's) had never been "a gully of the dimensions described by William Naish"; in this he was supported by four other informants; indeed, "it was never more than a scour drainage depression" (ibid. 122). 9 Joseph McKey, The Warwick Story, 1972, 115. Pages 112-117 were written by Professor Macintosh, who elsewhere (1967c: 115) acknowledges Fr. McKey 's help in his inquiries.</page><page sequence="29">Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK 107 Finally, in Mac's eyes in 1967 the Cowley site bore NO resemblance to David's or Naish's descriptions, whereas the Fraser site looked very like it. Moreover, it satisfies the general positioning given by George Clark the owner of the Talgai homestead, that it was "at the back of Suitor's", because the Lot (No. 31) on which Fraser put the cranium locus, had not been taken up in 1914 when Professor David was there. It was just "at the back of Suttor's", that is, of Cowley's. The confusion on the trail, however, was not yet quite cleared. When in March- April 1967, the Australian Broadcasting Commission producer was making the successful Talgai film, "a trench was bull-dozed into the south bank of the billabong where we were standing with Fraser, and we didn't realize he was protesting that we ought to make the trench on the north bank". Replaying the running tape-recording of all our conversations, we realized "he had protested four times and we had missed it".10 Therefore, in 1968 a trench was dug on the north side of the billabong. The result was astonishing. For the first time, we now had an excavated section on this North Bank which corresponded exactly with the Naish and David descriptions, and Fraser was vindicated. All our previous explorations had differed moderately to grossly from the Naish-David descriptions.11 The long complicated trail had ended. Mac could now see, as it were, what David had seen on 30th August, 1914, the location where the Talgai youth's cranium had rested for centuries, probably for millennia. Interlude: Why the South Bank? Professor Macintosh intended to cut a trench as near as possible to the discovery site of the cranium so as to determine its geological status and to get an approximate date. Why then did he have it bull-dozed on the south bank of the billabong, and take no heed of Fraser's vigorous protests? He says this happened in the confusion of making the film. Circumstances however, might have conditioned him unconsciously to regard the South Bank as the focal point, if not goal, of his long search. His immediate purpose was to follow the steps which Professor David had taken in 1914 under the guidance of William Naish who alone had seen the cranium in situ. He knew that David's car-driver was advised by a local farmer, Adam Bott, to go around on the north side of Dalrymple Creek to Suttor's (later Cowley's) house, as there was no bridge over the Creek. This meant that David, led by Naish, walked from north to south across the Dalrymple Creek ford and on towards the billabong, and so to the site. Over 50 years later, Mac and those with him driving from Warwick or Allora, along the road on the north side of Dalrymple Creek, usually called at 10McKey, op. cit. 115. 11 From unpublished paper presented to a general meeting of the A.l.A.b. m 197D, by N.

They crossed the Creek and going towards what had been the billabong (or gulch) saw, or rather pictured its south bank. Mac thought the latter would have been the steeper of the banks because of the sweep of the flood waters from the north and east, and then around in a southern arc before rushing and spreading on towards the west. Mac drew a sketch (Fig. 1) of this in a letter (January 23, 1972) to Dr. A. Rafter, Director of the Institute of Nuclear Sciences, Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, New Zealand, to help him picture the location of the ' COLLINS IRISH'S y *&lt; posTS "' '^^ ^v ~J) iW-^ ALLORA IS* So &amp;t°Sò' Figure 2 - Naish's fences shown by broken lines.

A coloured photo of the paddock of waving wheat, taking during Professor Macintosh's field work, still reflects faintly this course in spite of the filling-in by plough and bull-dozer over many» years (Plate 6). So the idea could have arisen of the cranium being exposed on the bank in front of him - and he was looking south. The imaginative reconstruction by Mac of what was hidden by the cultivated land and a wheat crop where once was a floodwater gulch was quite remarkable, even if the cranium site became displaced temporarily from the north to the south bank. But just as remarkable, though not exceptional, in men of the land, young and old, was Fraser's recollection of the scene at the time of</page><page sequence="31">Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK 109 Professor David's visit in 1914 before the agricultural and physical changes had taken place - before Weier had taken up his lot (No. 31) and had begun to work it. On 4th December, 1968, after bull-dozing the second trench on the south bank of the billabong at site B, Mac had an historically valuable recorded inter- view with Charles Fraser, who first started to go over Talgai way in 1911. I give a few extracts: In reply to Mac's comment that "you didn't tell me we were digging in the wrong place" (in 1967), Fraser said, "I haven't seen you since", and added: "I can't show you the exact spot but it's away down here because 50 years ago is a long time and that gully has been bulldozed since ... the original state it wasn't taken up, That's where that Β is. This other side, that side there, but I couldn't tell you within 50 yards or so exactly where it was. I'll show you where it was - it's where that stream comes around, that's where we took that old man and that's where David was lookin". "It comes around somehow like that - there's the green shed, Weier's shed here. This gully comes round here. You dug here. If you'd dug over on this other side, and I said to you why did you dig there, and you said well the water sweeps around here, and that would be swept out deep there. Well it wasn't, it was just the reverse. It was deep this other side but not this side. It was deep on the R. side and the other side was a slope. Both sides there was no cultivation in those times and since cultivation started and the soil was washed down it's not that high? see what I mean. Where Weier's been bulldozing. He bulldozed all his gully in when he bought it". To a remark by Mac that Fraser had said this North Bank was the steep bank, the latter replied, "It was steeper than the other side, the other side was a sloping bank. I got a few of those nodules that day we was there for something to do. But I wasn't interested in what Prof. David was doing because those times, it was just a skull". Later on Mac said to Fraser, "You and I walked across this paddock and we came around here and we stood there and you said this is it. And I said what about that other place in Cowleys and you said No No No. Whereabouts here." Fraser: "Down along here. We were standing on this bank where you dug." Again Mac: "You say it's on the other side." Fraser: "No on the wall see, he (Naish) said that he'd seen it on the wall. There's the wall there. He was pointing to the opposite bank, and that's where they done all his lookin and got some nodules you know." Mac: "And about how far down do you reckon that was?" Fraser: "I just can't remember, I wouldn't be able to say. It's on that swoop around I remember that, but just how far down I just wouldn't commit myself to say." And returning later to the same problem of the Trench (No. 1) being bull-dozed on the left hand side of the gully, as the flood stream would have flowed from east to west, Fraser repeated:</page><page sequence="32">110 Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK "They dug on the left side of the gully, well that was a slopin side there. Well this old chap and Prof. David, I can remember it as if it was only yesterday, there on the deep side, the right side and you said when I mentioned it to you I can remember it now, you said when I mentioned it to you, I remember, the sweep come around here, that'd be the deep side. Those times there was no cultivation there, see not like it is today. Up the creek a bit from there there was a bit, but around about there, there was no cultivation and since they started cultivating the soil keeps shifting and I asked Lennie Weier I said you must've bulldozed that gully and he said yes he did." As for Site A (the Cowley site); that, said Fraser "used to be practically all water in the plain when I was working there (it was Suttor's then) and cracks in the dry time you could fall down." And finally, in order for Mac to get a better record, he advised: dig on the north bank - but "not down the slope; you wouldn't want to dig right on the near slope now, - but just on the high part, not on the slope. The way that gully's filled up with black soil even in 50 years it would have to be man made filled up". To go back to 1886, following the flood, Naish coming from Allora would have travelled as usual by way of Bott's farm on the south side of Dalrymple Creek and then turned northerly to cross the billabong and reached the fence he was erecting 600 yards or so further on, but still on the south side of the Creek. Hence he would have noticed the now exposed strange object lying embedded amongst the small nodules of carbonate on the north bank of the gulch. He picked it up and realized both its weight and its uniqueness. And though about 30 years had passed before he guided Professor David to the site he "got his bearings straight away", said Fraser in 1968; adding "of course 30 years is not a great while to be away, you know, for a bushman". When guiding Professor David in 1914, Naish was a cripple and a passenger in a motor car which could not follow his 1886 track to the fence, and approach the cranium site from the south. Instead, he had to start with the Professor from Suttor's on the north side of Dalrymple Creek and of "his" fence. Hence the necessity, as an aid to his memory, for Naish to find the two large posts of the wide gate, which presumably he used in 1886 when on his way to and from his work camp. From those posts he 'set' a course slightly west of south as in the afternoons of working days of 30 and more years before. This was all clear to Charles Fraser when telling the story to Mac in 1967, because he was one of the two who carried the crippled Naish. Having found his gate posts, the latter led David to the cranium site. This, however, though marked in the correct general location on Fig. 9 in Macintosh (1967c: 112) as distinct from the Jack Cowley position (A) is wrongly placed on the south side of the billabong. If it had been there, Naish and David could have gone to it in 1914 from Bott's farm without crossing the billabong, let alone Dalrymple</page><page sequence="33">Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK.

MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK 111 Creek. Hence the question of this interlude: Why the South Bank? Clearly, from the "internal evidence", that is, the facts so painstakingly recorded by Mac, the point emerges clear and firm that the cranium was not found by f^aish in 1886 on the South Bank but on the North Bank, and Fraser was correct in his protests. The data recorded and made available by a scientific observer, are self-correcting. The Final Task: Dating As the result of his ten field trips, multitudinous interviews, and having four trenches dug, Mac concluded that he could do no more that was useful in field work at Talgai, and that the problem was henceforth for the laboratory: "Matching of the material (crust and soil) which we can still get off the skull, with the trace elements or whatever, in the soil samples we have adready dated or which await dating." So he wrote to Dr. Rafter on 11th February, 1972, adding that "pari passu is the research problem of proving the accuracy of TALGAI NORTH BANK 1968 1972 2* . 20 .

From this it would appear that the skull horizon has to be between 3.0 and 4.6 metres, with the probability that it is at the 4.2 to 4.3 level that being the greatest concentration of carbonate (David). One can only assume a greater amount of "black soil" overburden has been ploughed (pushed) from north to south since David's 1914 visit, and so makes the carbonate further below surface level than when he saw it. (Copy of a diagram drawn by N.W.G.M. in a letter (February 11, 1972) to Dr. A. Rafter.)</page><page sequence="36">112 Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK those dates, which it seems to me you and Hendy12 have for all practical purposes achieved." Starting from Professor David's observations that the cranium was 10 or 1 1 feet below surface level, and in a stratum of dense carbonate concentration, he found that the North bank trench (No. 3 on diagram, Fig. 1) sunk in 1968 to a depth of 3.5m (lift. 6in.), after "confrontation" by C. Fraser, "fitted these two requirements exactly". A second North bank trench (No. 4 on diagram, Fig. 1), was sunk in 1972 to a depth of 4.75 m (15ft. 5in.). This was on Dr. Rafter's advice so as to get below the cranium horizon and confirm the minimum age of the cranium. Several series of samples of soil, each weighing 2 lbs, and also of carbonate nodules when present, spanning 10 cm intervals were taken from the middle and deepest part of the North bank trench (No. 4), and also as a control, from the second South bank trench (No. 2 on diagram, Fig. 1). All were sent to Dr. Rafter in New Zealand for dating.13 In the 1972 trench the carbonate begins to appear at 3.0 m as in the 1968 trench, and continues to increase in concentration down to the 4.3 m depth. It then lessens and disappears below 4.6 m. If we bear in mind the ploughing of black soil by the farmers on top of the site since David saw it, we might well infer that his "about 10 or 11 feet below the surface" should now read 13 or 14 feet. "In which case the skull horizon ought to be at our present 4.2 - 4.3 m to be in the dense carbonate concentration he referred to." And the results: the radiocarbon (C-14) date obtained on the carbonate nodules at 310 cm (10 feet) and at 340 cm (11 feet) in the north bank, were respectively about 9,160 and 11,650 years ago. Further, the organic content of the soil samples from the south bank showed a somewhat similar increase with depth, from about 4,700 years at 130 cm (4ft. 3in.) to about 12,400 at 290 cm (9ft. 6in.) - though the accuracy of these latter readings cannot be guaranteed. Dr. C. Hendy from Dr. Rafter's New Zealand laboratory accompanied Professor Macintosh to Talgai and "collected samples of creek, well, ground seepage and bore water and 36 varieties of native trees and grasses. C-13 and C-12 tests were made on these. Complicated calculations of ratios between C-14, C-13 and C-12 results led to the (at least tentative) conclusion that the results in years set out above are reliable. This means that approximately 12,000 years is the age of the layer from which the skull probably came."14 12 C. H. Hendy, Institute of Nuclear Sciences, D.S.I.R., New Zealand, of which Dr. A. Rafter was formerly Director. 18 The trenches were 27.5 m long and started 3 m distant irom me cresi in eacn case of the south and north banks of the billabong. The particulars are from Macintosh's letter to Dr. Rafter, 23rd January, 1972. 14 Professor Macintosh in The Warwick Story, by Joseph McKey, Wll, p. no. Macintosh's pages (112-117) provide an excellent short summary of the Talgai saga, giving deserved emphasis to local co-operation.</page><page sequence="37">Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK 113 Proving that the cranium came from this layer of soil was quite another matter, but Mac hoped that complicated examination (Neutron Activation Analysis) of the soil which was being separated from between the "shattered and telescoped bone fragments of the cranium" might do so.

MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK the necessary analysis has not been completed, but the overall conclusion was that the soil horizon at which the cranium was found corresponds to the surface at 14,000 years B.P. Possibly, "however, the cranium is even older than this and extrapolation to 5 cm depth where the lithology of the encrustation matches that of the soil would give an age of about 20,000 years B.P." (1972d:D117). There I leave this story, as Mac did, hoping to have made clear his determination, persistence, enthusiasm, and immense powers of concentrated effort. I find it hard to realize, although I was in close touch with Mac throughout his Talgai years, the amount of work, planning and travel he devoted to it, and at the same time did so much else. I must, however, underline the co-operation Mac gained, much of it at little or no financial cost, from scientists of other Institutions: from Edmund Gill, Geologist of the National Museum, Melbourne, who was with him in his first three periods of field work in the Talgai region in 1963 and 1964, as well as during the Australian Broadcasting Commission Television Filming in 1967, and concentrated on the general and specific geological context and time aspect of the location. I welcome Mr. Gill's specialist contribution to this memorial publication. Later, Mr. George Hubble of the C.S.I.R.O. Soil Division Brisbane, with his team, core-drilled to a depth of 30 feet in three places along- side and beyond the billabong as a result of which trenches were sunk in selected places and samples at 10 cm intervals from top to bottom were taken from them for analysis. Dr. Athol Rafter, then Director, Institute of Nuclear Sciences, New Zealand, who undertook freely the immense task of dating all these samples, including those of carbonate nodules; and Dr. C. Hendy of the same Institution, who actually visited the Talgai location to collect a wide range of material for complicated analysis. Inspector Ray Caldwell of the Atomic Energy Commission, Research Establishment, Lucas Heights, to whom material from the cranium itself was sent for Neutron Activation Analysis; and finally Mr. Wilsted of the University of New England, who examined 33 soil samples for pollen spores; he found none.

Reassembling Fragments: Lake Nitchie I have referred to the 3,900 bone fragments of the Green Gully remains, of which only 730 could be identified and used. The reassemblage was a tribute to the ability and patience of Macintosh and those helping him. Similarly, as I have just mentioned, he separated all, or almost all, the Talgai cranium fragments from the soil crust in which they were embedded, so as to analyse the latter and determine the cranium's geological stratum; in addition, and very importantly, his purpose was to reassemble the fragments in order to restore the cranium to its natural, undamaged form. I understand that he had drawn an outline of what, with his experience and informed eye, he thought that would be, but ill-health and death intervened. His assistants and fellow workers remain. I urge that they be encouraged to finish the task. Another fascinating piece of reconstruction and interpretation was of the Lake Nitchie skeleton and its paraphernalia. Seen by the keen eye of Mr. J. M. Bowler on December 11, 1969,15 it was excavated by Mac and one of his staff, on January 14, 1970. The excavation demanded not only skill but also an expert anatomist's knowledge - because it had been crushed into a grave cut into hard calcareous clay. Macintosh and his helpers, Κ. Ν. Smith and A. B. Bailey, have given a detailed progress report of their work and that of other members of his staff (1970c:85ff, foot-notes, p. 92). This was a "semi- recumbent but fully knee-flexed burial" with a "side-niche cut in the left wall to slot-in the feet". The body was pressed into the grave with some resulting dislocation. I draw special attention to the experiments with articulated skeletons in Professor Macintosh's Department of Anatomy, and to the attempts of some of his staff to "assume near approaches to the positions indicated by the Nitchie bones". Photographs were taken laterally and from above. These experiments appeared to bear out Mac's interpretation of the position of the interred corpse. They also emphasize his scientific and Charles Darwin-like approach to his work: experimental as well as observational. In this case, while decay had affected some parts of the skeleton, 80% survived, and reassemblage was not the problem as with the Green Gully specimens. There were many fractures of the long bones and ribs, which "came apart at excavation and had to be identified and reassembled subsequently". 15 J. M.

MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK "The skull, on removal, fell apart in some 65 pieces" which, with only a couple of exceptions, were reassembled edge to edge accurately. The skeleton was of an Australian Aboriginal male, about 6 feet 2 inches tall, aged at death 37 zt 4 years, and showed no pathological signs, except in the lower first molars, and no indication of the cause of death. A more trying task was faced in reassembling what turned out to be a long necklace of pierced teeth, all being canine teeth of Sarcophilus. 162 were positively identified, about 40 of which were "reassembled from split or fractured fragments, in some cases as many as seven fragments being fitted together to reconstitute a single tooth; but in most cases only two or three longitudinally split portions needed edge matching to complete a tooth". Professor Macintosh made the preliminary identification of the teeth and portions of teeth, which was then checked by Dr. B. Barker (Dental Anatomist). The painstaking task of matching and reassembling these minute fragments was voluntarily done by Miss Donlon (a Science student), Mrs. King (Macintosh's secretary) and Mrs. Macintosh. The 162 teeth were derived from at least 46 animals but more likely from over 100. This number took into consideration 126 items (including 25 crown fragments and 20 root apices) which were not matched with the identified, incomplete teeth and might represent an additional 31 animals. In a later paper (1971 a: 55) following further sieving of the matrix and matching of fragments, the number of teeth was raised to 178 and still 121 fragments remained. So much for the number of teeth assembled or reassembled, and the number of animals from which they came! But as Mac noted, whether the latter be 46 or over 100, it "represents a very considerable slaughter of Sarcophilus and this must represent some index of antiquity, of ritual import, and of status of the Aboriginal wearer of the necklace", (1970c: 96) for such it was as the positioning of the teeth showed. Antiquity is indicated; because with one possible exception, Sarcophilus does not occur in excavations after ca. 3,000 B.P., when indeed it became extinct on Mainland Australia. Actually, the C-14 date of this Lake Nitchie skeleton, calculated from bone collagen, was 6,820±200. Further, "a frequency of Sarcophilus population sufficient to provide" the teeth for the Nitchie necklace would demand ecological conditions very different from those at the site in 1970 or "even 3,000 years ago". The present dry lake bed must have held "permanent water" and had a "lush dense vegetation around its shores", and that must have been "some nine millennia ago" according to our understanding of the geographical conditions there in that epoch. Macintosh was impressed by what he regarded as ritual aspects of this burial and which, he thought, could have a bearing on the construction of the</page><page sequence="43">Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK 119 necklace. A small localized fire had been made in front of the left first rib "at the near terminal phase of the burial", much as in the case of the Mossgiel skeleton - a fairly widespread Aboriginal practice down to modern times. The man had lost his "maxillary central incisors" by ritual avulsion. Removal of one tooth as a ritual act was widely practised, especially in Eastern Australia, though not of two teeth. However, this was the custom in the Dampier Land Peninsula, north of Broome, North-Western Australia when Dampier careened his ship there, and I saw the operation on Sunday Island in January, 1928. It was preceded and accompanied by quite impressive ritual.10 The Australia- wide occurrence of the custom suggests some antiquity, but this discovery of Macintosh dates it back 7,000 years or so - which, I for one, had not contemplated. A man, deceased in the prime of life, interred in a grave cut with difficulty in hardened clay, with his fire, around which, no doubt, the mourners watched for a season, was probably highly regarded in life. Fifty years ago I surveyed all references in the literature to Aboriginal burials, and concluded that "status" burial was practised very widely according to age, sex, "social" and ritual criteria.17 So here, the corpse was not put into an easily dug grave, but into one which ensured protection of the body and bones from predators. And further, in this case, the corpse was adorned not just with a necklace, but with one skilfully strung with over 160 pierced teeth from a rare species of animal. Such a "priceless" ornament, interred with a dead person, seemed to Macintosh to be a symbol of the wearer's ritual importance and totemic affiliation. Moreover, from his examination of the object, he thought a number of craftsmen had contributed to its making and "probably over more than one generation", and indeed "the teeth do not look to be of similar vintage" (ibid. 97). Later on (1971a: 60), he expressed the view that the necklace represented an ongoing concern in replacement of and/or additions over generations. Probably too, it was hidden for most of the year between ritual usages. I would compare this with the regular practice of removing from the actors' bodies, winding up and saving Ornamented string' by performers in sacred ritual. This has been reported since the days of Spencer and Gillen. Such a suggestion is supported by the archaeological evidence of a very lengthy occupation of the area: one mile south of Lake Nitchie cremated bone fragments were directly C-14 collagen dated at 15,300 B.P. Mac had read social and cultural anthropology with me, and also had accompanied me on two expeditions in 1949 and 1952 in which the study of rituals played a major part. In an address to Science graduates of the University 1βΑ. P. Elkin, "Initiation in the Bard Tribes, North- West Australia." /. Roy. Soc.

MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK of Sydney in 1974 he kindly said: "Emeritus Professor A. P. Elkin . . . had years ago instanced parallels of Australian and Asian rituals, religious philosophy, projection of information over vast distances by covert means, and foreshadowed the unveiling of such linkages and their derivation. He is now vindicated by archaeological evidence, which shows that ancient Australian man was engaged in spiritual and material practices which rank chronologically with their earliest exhibition by Homo sapiens sapiens" (1974c: 69). Indeed, just in the preceding three years conclusive evidence had come to light "that ancient man in Australia was practising inhumation and cremation burial, initiation by tooth avulsion, the use of ritual fire in the grave, the use of red ochre to adorn the body or bones of the dead, the inclusion in the grave of goods which had belonged to the deceased" {ibid. 69). In a magnificently illustrated article in Anthropologie, Macintosh (1971a) deals fully with the anatomical features of this skeleton, and then again discusses the cultural aspects of the burial. He infers tentatively a relation of some elements to a new cultural complex of which a revolution in stone technology is the only one dated - namely from certainly 5,000 years to possibly 7,000 years ago. He suggests that a similar period "saw the inclusion of the dingo into Aboriginal mythology, introduction of pecking technique in rock engraving, the introduction of subincision as an addition to circumcision, ritual tooth avulsion as a possible alternative to ritual subincision, cult heroes replacing sky gods, and pari passu with innovations, a phasing out of more archaic items such as mythology and ritual related to Sarcophilus" (ibid. 57). In the margin of this paragraph in an offprint Mac has put a ?. I do not think his references to circumcision and subincision can be correct. Dampier, who first reported the almost Australia-wide custom of tooth avulsion, did not report circumcision. He did so in the Philippines and he had every opportunity to observe it in Dampier Land Peninsula where he careened his ship. The Aborigines did not wear any covering, and if not in 1688, then later they did practise circumcision. Moreover, subincision, which seems to have been adopted after circumcision, had only spread from north-west Australia over a swelling pear-shaped region, possibly half of the continent, at the time of white settlement. Further, there is no evidence suggesting that subincision replaced tooth-avulsion, whereas in some areas men ceased to practise the latter when circumcision was adopted.18 Approach through Cultural Anthropology Mac's article on "Lake Nitchie Skeleton - Unique Aboriginal Burial" (1970c) is of special interest, because of its cultural aspects. It opens up a long vista of occupation of a region, not always the dry and inhospitable place the white 18 A. P. Elkin, The Australian Aborigines, 4th edition 1964, 5th edition 1974, pp. 62-3 and map, pp. 66-7.</page><page sequence="45">Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK 121 man has known. The Aborigines there about 7,000 years ago were already advanced in technology (e.g. drilling canine teeth for stringing, digging a grave in hard clay), and concerned with social order (e.g. status burial) and ritual practices (e.g. tooth avulsion and burial ritual fire). Indeed, Mac could have detected at Lake Nitchie some foreshadowing of the ritual and mythology he had read into the engravings on Dingo Rock, Mootwingee, in the same general south-western region of New South Wales (1962:277): "the mura ancestor or 'spirit being' concept . . . the travels of Heroes . . ." and an older series of figures suggesting "that totemism and increase rites may also have been involved . . . Had Elkin been in possession of present data, he would, doubtless, have stressed more vigorously his remarks about mura mythology and its influence in this region".19 Thus, I might have referred to my observations in 1930 as well as to the information then gathered for burial in north-eastern South Australia amongst the Yantruwanta and Yauarawaka tribes, in the northern part of the same arid region as Lake Nitchie. An important part of the burial ritual was lighting a fire for the deceased's comfort, and for that of the mourners who sat around and sang the series of sacred songs of the deceased person's cult-totem all day and every day until the series was finished; meanwhile every evening they threw into the grave earth or sand until a mound was raised.20 This contribution of Macintosh to the paper by F. D. McCarthy and himself, was like his later Lake Nitchie studies, not only marked by meticulously careful description, but also by imaginative though well controlled, interpretation. He had already shown this combined approach in a section of his Diploma of Anthropology Thesis, 1950, a section which, indeed, I hope will be published. In 1949 and 1952 Mac accepted my invitation to be a member of a research team I was taking to Arnhem Land to record Aboriginal music, to observe and film (where possible) Aboriginal dances and ritual, to study social organization and languages, and to do some physical anthropology. This last, of course, was to be Mac's special role in the project. We were both interested in, but not happy with, J. B. BirdselFs theory of the tri-hybrid racial constitution of the Australian Aborigines. Tri-hybrid and di-hybrid theories did not arise with Dr. Birdsell, as I showed in an address to the Anthropological Society of New South Wales, which gave Mac food for thought. At any rate, he went with me to Arnhem Land in 1949, and amidst the other activities of the expedition, he kept this problem in mind (1952a:208-215). After observing and measuring the men he reported that the 19 Α. Ρ Elkin (1949): "The Origin and Interpretation of Petroglyphs in South-Eastern Australia", Oceania, XX, 141, 148, 155. »A. P.

MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK bewildering array of tall and short stature, bulky calves and thighs and spindly extremities . . . straight hair and woolly hair, long narrow faces and short broad faces, was so different from what had been anticipated that a realization of the continuity of variety did not occur until much later. On the other hand, he concluded that Such contrasts of tall and short occurring in relatively restricted groups in each of the three widely separated regions in the Northern Territory would seem to question those concepts which predicate a tall linear type for the north of Australia, a medium people for the south-east and a short or pygmoid type for the far south and isolated pockets of retreat country (ibid. 214). But probably his most significant generalization was "that the collective theories of homogeneity should be restated in the following terms: "The Australian Aborigines are not modern hybrids but ancient hybrids, as we all are, and in the modern sense they are a homogeneous people but possessing a gene pool with a wide range of variation" (ibid. 208 ).21 This, however, was not the most important result Mac obtained from the 1949 and 1952 field trips. It was rather his experience of the living full-blood Aborigines, including old men who had known the pre-contact period, and had not lost their indigenous social, economic and ritual values, their artistic skills nor their native mental reactions and approaches. Mac has shown his appre- ciation of this in two articles, "Paintings in Beswick Creek Cave" (1952c) and especially in his valuable and frank contribution to a Symposium of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies on "Schématisation in Art" held in Canberra in 1974. The Symposium papers, revised or not, were published in a magnificent volume, Form in indigenous art: Schématisation in the art of Aboriginal Australia and prehistoric Europe, 1977. Macintosh's paper, "Beswick Creek Cave two decades later: a reappraisal" appeared in the section entitled "Form and identification in a living context" (1977:191-197). And there it belongs, though its reference is also to a wider field of 'archaeological art', be this Aboriginal or European; he had visited many of the classical sites in Europe. After agreeing to take part in this Symposium, Mac mentioned to me that he was puzzled by the key-word, schématisation, in its sub-title. As the term schema is not used by ethnologists, though occasionally one refers to Kant, and as Lévi-Strauss had used Kantian concepts of empirical and transcendental deduction,22 I thought that we should know what Kant said about schema. 21 In craniological studies of S. L. Larnach and Macintosh of the Aborigines of North Queensland (Oceania Monograph No. 15, 1970), the results again failed to support Birdsell's tri-hybrid theory, and in addition showed that there was no basis that any alien racial groups other than intrusive Papuans and possibly Indonesians occurred in Queensland. Moreover, "the Cairns Rain Forest (the Barrinean) skulls fall completely within the range of the New South Wales coastal crania" (op.cit. 68-9). eE.g. "The Deduction of the Crane" in Structural Analysis of Oral Tradition, edited by P. and Ε. Κ. Maranda, 1971.</page><page sequence="47">Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK 123 For me, this meant going back six decades to 1913 when I studied Kant, and trying again to understand what part schema played in his system of thought. A daunting task, and possibly Mac was not helped much by the short working paper I gave him on the subject, and probably wondered during the symposium whether any contributor had come to grips with Kant's analyses, or whether there was any point in doing so in the sphere of prehistoric and current primitive art. In his analysis, Critique of Pure Reason, Kant posits a "third thing", the schema, between a pure conception of the understanding and the object of sense. But the schema, while being a product of the imagination, is not the image of the individual object of perception, rather, it expresses the universal process of imagination - and exists only in thought. Indeed, "the schematism of our understanding in its application to phenomena and to their pure form is an art hidden away in the depths of the soul". Such was the relevant core of my working paper, but what is the relevance? In 1936 Mr. R. H. Goddard made freehand drawings of series of rock engravings at Burragurra and Yango in the St. Albans-Wollombi region of New South Wales, south of Maitland. Accurately scaled diagrams would have been preferable, but an Aboriginal elder of "high degree", a friend of mine, who knew the region read these diagrams like the tracing board of a secret lodge. He interpreted the separate signs and symbols as well as whole stories. Moreover he gave the same readings on two occasions.23 Probably the drawings were not replicas of the engravings, but such variations were not obstacles; an object of sense is not a replica of the schema. My Aboriginal interpreter saw the expression of the schema as an object of sense, of the schema itself hidden away in the depth of the soul. But he only could do that because he was heir to the universal schema of his people, and that was intertribal. Wherever I went, and whatever sacred symbol of sacramental import I showed groups of initiated elders, the response was the same: "that is pretty" and down on their haunches they sank chanting sacred songs. The designs on the objects may have been similar or not, but the "schema of their sensuous conceptions was a product of pure a priori imagination", to use Kant's phraseology. Therefore, in the case of Australian Aboriginal sacred art, we must rely on the interpretation of the masters and past-masters in the depths of whose souls the schemata lie hidden. This is the underlined and underlying message of Macintosh's contribution to the symposium on Form in indigenous art even if not put in these words in his Introduction by Dr. Peter Ucko, the editor of the published record. On the whole Dr. Ucko seems to accept the main points made by Macintosh - 23 A. P. Elkin, (1949-50): "The Origin and Interpretation of Petroglyphs in South-East Australia", Oceania, XX, 119-157, especially pp. 129-137.</page><page sequence="48">124 Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK particularly "that all attempts to interpret the significance of artistic represen- tations, without the assistance of 'informants' fully versed in the culture concerned, are doomed to failure" (op.cit., 15). Macintosh, however, made another point to which Dr. Ucko does not refer. To quote Macintosh (1977c: 191): Retrospectively, I came to think of these two sets of explanations as being in the first instance a lay interpretation sufficiently satisfactory in his opinion for me. In the second instance an erudite interpretation for Professor Elkin, going much beyond the first, and appropriate to the depth of knowledge and length of association and understanding between Lamderod and Elkin, on matters of Aboriginal inner lore. In the context of the Aborigines' sacred heritage, be this textual or representational, especially if protected by obligations of secrecy, revelation of "facts", and especially of meaning, only comes in stages, through degrees, as "fitness" is proved. I had surveyed, collated and analysed the available literature on Aboriginal initiation up to the early 1920's, when, becoming a member of a secret 'Lodge' in our own society, I was able after taking each step, or degree, to predict to the somewhat astonished "brethren" what the next would be - in spite of their prided secrecy. So too, in reverse, when I went into the field amongst full-blood Aborigines from 1927 onwards, my knowledge and experience gained in this "Lodge work", helped also by my appreciation and practice of sacramental aspects of "High Church" doctrine, seemed to satisfy the "outer and inner guards" and the old boss, the ritual headman, to admit me, and put me in the way of understanding. All this was almost unrealized by myself and certainly took place without persuasion of any sort, by word or bargaining on my part. Macintosh obviously noticed my position in this regard in various parts of Arnhem Land, for example in my relations with Lamderod and Mangga at Beswick Creek, and with the old Maraian ritual headman at Mainoru, under whose orders in 1949 two old men prepared a special rangga (ritual pole painted with a totemic design) for me in a "third" shade (structure of leafy boughs, but symbolizing the shades of the mythical heroes). This shade was set apart from the separate shades for the two ritual moieties in this Maraian festival. Mac, who had been very impressed by the ceaseless activity of the Maraian, was indeed not a little over-awed, when late on our last night at Mainoru (and dark, silent and eerie it was on the now deserted, secret ground), under the guard of an old man, my sponsor, he helped wrap up and carry this symbol from there to the expedition truck. The secret life and its revelation were no idle forms. It was the symbol of my position as a "headman" of the Maraian: henceforth I was "old man". In 1952 I quickly learnt that Lamderod and Mangga were aware of my symbolic "elevation" at Mainoru, two tribal territories</page><page sequence="49">Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK 125 to the north-east. This deepened the understanding between them and myself, to which Mac referred. Thus, he realized that there were degrees or levels of revelation, and that, in those days at any rate, the meaning and deeper significance of sacred designs and objects, as well as of texts, were only vouchsafed to those whom the "old men" willed. As he wrote (ibid. 197) It is now a matter of regret that the history of these two caves up to the death of the informants and beyond, was not followed up; and there is no question that such follow up would have enriched in depth the interpretations. As he saw the matter: "the mental code of the artists' schématisation cannot be cracked without keys provided by highly initiated informants". And so he concluded his chapter by quoting from myself (pers. comm.): Efforts by non-Aboriginal interpreters may produce interesting logical and consistent theory, but is an approach through their own schématisation which is in danger of producing interpretations of their own concepts. In the New Guinea Highlands When drawing up a plan of research in social anthropology in Melanesia for the South Pacific Commission in 1950, I visited the thickly populated Central Highlands of New Guinea. I happened to be in the Wabag sub-district west of Mt. Hagen when, on three successive days in neighbouring 'park-centres', meetings of several thousand people at each were held to finalize in colourful, festive and yet business-like manner the Te delayed-exchange. I recommended that Wabag was a first priority for research amongst what was then "almost everywhere in the sub-district, an untouched people and culture".24 My talks, with slides, on this very numerous people of short stature living in comparative isolation at high altitudes of 7,000 to 10,000 feet, attracted the enthusiastic interest of medical scientists as well as anthropologists. Here was a unique opportunity for research amongst a recently discovered and apparently vigorous people before they became modified in diet, way of life and disease patterns following contact with Europeans. Discussions took place between Professor (later Sir) Harold Dew (Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Sydney), Professor H. K. Ward (Bacteriology, who was associated with the New South Wales Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service), Professor A. N. Burkitt (Anatomy, sometime member of the anthropological research committee of the Australian National Research Council), and myself. A joint application for a reseach grant was made to the Nuffield Foundation by the University of Sydney Departments of Anthropology and Anatomy and by the Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service. The response was generous. Dr. N. W. G. Macintosh (in place of Professor Burkitt, retired), Dr. R. J. Walsh (Director 24 A. P. Elkin, Social Anthropology in Melanesia: 1953:84-5.</page><page sequence="50">126 Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK of the Blood Transfusion Service) and myself became the committee in charge of the project which I described as follows: Social anthropology will form a basic part in the research, both for its own sake, and also as a means of approach and for the light which knowledge of social structure might throw on genetic grouping. Physical anthropology will include not only those measurements and observations which are, or may be, significant genetically and ecologically, but also blood groups and finger-prints both of which are genetically based. Moreover, it is planned to obtain blood for determination of disease anti- bodies and for a study of basal metabolism. Surveys of nutrition and of diseases, and a study of population problems will also form part of the programme. The two or three areas in which work will be carried out present important problems in Physical Anthropology; e.g., variations in height (including many individuals within the pygmy range), and in skin colour (including a "reddish- white"); the effect of living for possibly very long periods at high altitudes (over 7,000 feet) in comparative isolation; and a striking abnormality in blood proteins already disclosed in one area. A genetic and ecological approach should be rewarding.25 I was responsible for field planning and co-ordination and spent a month in the Territory consulting with the Administrator and senior officers, and in the field finalizing local arrangements. At my request Macintosh accepted responsibility for directing field work in physical anthropology and related spheres, and at the end of May 1955 went into the region for two months. He set in motion blood sampling, certain medical observations and procedures in physical anthropology. He was joined by Mr. B. Lockett of the technical staff of the Department of Anatomy, who remained for several months to carry on the work. Blood samples were analysed in other laboratories for other objectives.26 Macintosh (Professor of Anatomy since July 1955) returned to the field from the 2nd January to the 27th February 1957, as did Lockett who obtained blood "samples from the more remote and difficult sub-areas" as well as test-samples from Mendi and Tari Districts "for contrast and comparison" (1958b: 175). I record my appreciation of Mac's work in this field which was new to him. With his usual drive, he made the work move and established good relations with administration, mission staff and the local inhabitants. The results of the project justified the cost in money and effort. His own contributions may be seen in several articles in his Bibliography (1957:197-205; 1958b: 173-198; 1959a:834-836; 1960:279-293; 1965a: 286-304), while those of others include Hugh Ward, "Infectious Disease in the Western Highlands of New Guinea" (Oceania, XXVIII, March 1958, 199-203), and M.

MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK 127 "The Blood Groups of the Native Inhabitants of the Western Highlands, New Guinea" (1958b) is the most interesting anthropologically. This is the case even though the authors were disappointed that in view of the volume of blood group data, 5,000 samples, the origin of this Highland people and their relation to other New Guinea peoples remained inconclusive. But the authors thought that an examination of "a migratory pathway suggested by geographical and anthropological considerations" seemed reasonable. At this point, Mac entered coolly and scientifically into the realm of ethnological speculation, and pro- pounded a view which seemed worthwhile, and at least, which other work could test. He . . . suggests that not only the Wabag people, but all the highlanders are the product of hybridisation between an earlier stratum which occupied the entire island from coast to coast, and a later immigrant wave. Mixture of the later arrived people with the earlier inhabitants obviously has not occurred uniformly in all parts of the occupied territory, and in general, the coastal belts show preponderance of the later immigrants, compared with the highlands. It is postulated that the majority of the early inhabitants of New Guinea moved to the highlands where they found better living conditions. The later arrivals first impinged upon, and by diffusion occupied the coastal regions, where they mixed with and largely submerged the earlier residents. The present inhabitants of the coastal regions are virtually the descendants of the later arrivals. Sporadic intrusion of still later people has produced irregularity of the picture, especially in the Milne Bay region. (See Fig. 5.) The later arrivals would also have spread to the highlands, but the intensity of mixture would not have been so great in the highlands as on the coast. It is suggested therefore that the characteristics of the earlier people have persisted to a considerably greater extent in the highlands than in the coastal regions. This would explain the shorter stature uniformly seen throughout the highlands, the greater frequency of light-skinned natives on the highlands and the different physical ap- pearance of the highlanders as a whole when compared with the coastals as a whole. It is to be noted that there are differences in the stature, colour of skin and general physical appearance between adjacent highland groups as a result of irregular hybridisation of the two strata (1958b: 193). Macintosh also suggested routes of entry into the Highlands, pointing out that the hypothesis was not refuted by the blood group studies and that some linguistic studies were consistent with the latter and supported the hypothesis advanced. He closed his contribution by emphasizing "that the New Guinea Highland natives are probably no 'purer' than any other population" (1958b: 197). Macintosh later assisted with field material Dr. L. Freedman in an article, "Stature variation in Western Highland Males of East New Guinea" (1965a: 286-304), which should be read along with the preceding one. Sufficient here to state the conclusion, based on the measurements of over 2,000 individuals. The results denied a conclusive altitude-stature correlation,</page><page sequence="52">128 Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK . . . but the suspicion was very strongly provoked that additional types of environmental data might account for the discrepancies observed in the altitude-stature correlation tests. . . . However, in the main (this) analysis of stature in the limited area of New Guinea examined supports an hypothesis of the intrusion of a taller group into a shorter statured population. This view is not necessarily antagonistic to that suggested by the blood groups, if the two strata are considered to be derived from the same basic stock. . . . one might well postulate that New Guinea was colonized by only one basic stock and that local evolution of pygmies subsequently occurred in the highlands. More recently explosive coastal population increases (perhaps due to the introduction of sweet potato) forced inland migrations of the taller peripheral populations, resulting in the present picture of a short people being invaded by one of taller stature, but from a blood group point of view, both basically similar (1965a: 302).

This may seem a senseless question to a person who like myself was nurtured largely in country regions where pastoralists and farmers branded the dingo as a predator, a threat to his lambs if not also to his grown up sheep and calves. Therefore dog proof fences were built around properties and even across vast portions of a State as in Western Queensland. Here and there, too, especially in rugged districts, one man had the reputation of being a good dingo hunter, knowing its habits and how he might decoy it so that he could at last shoot it. Indeed, according to my memory, the confrontation was always of one man against not any dingo, but a particular "rogue dingo", and with it he played hide and seek. When he won, he was financially rewarded by pastoralists and farmers. Moreover, Government and Shire Councils encouraged this opinion of the dingo, of all dingoes, by paying a fixed sum (a "bounty") for a scalp. E.g. in north-western South Australia in 1930 several "dogger-men" depended on dog-scalps for at least part of their living - and got them by paying Aborigines with flour, tea, sugar and tobacco, to bring the scalps to them, which they did. Professor Macintosh made a study of the dingo one of his major interests, but not primarily to evaluate this widespread attitude to the animal, although at the end of his research he did conclude that what had been regarded as a pest was actually a potent factor in the balance of nature, and that people on the land had deprived themselves of an asset, and at much cost. Indeed, he formed the idea after years of inquiry that the dingo served "a useful role as a predator on such pests as rabbits, marsupial mice, feral cats and as a remover of carrion" although it did make sporadically attacks on lambs and perhaps calves. Mac reached this conclusion only after searching the literature, using questionnaires and conducting a wide correspondence; and then by supplementing all this by a 2,000 mile circuit in 1953 in central Western Australia and by surveys in far western New South Wales, in regions of central Australia, Arnhem Land, Cape York Peninsula and the central mountainous region of New South Wales. On these field trips Mac sought for breeding haunts, tracks, and evidence of dingo movements, and collected the products of trapping and baiting. No opportunity was missed: thus we stopped our truck when making for central Arnhem Land to record ritual in 1949 to enable Mac to examine a dingo carcass we noticed not far from the track, and on another occasion to take a photo of a distant live one. Apart from the information thus gained in the field, Mac got together a large collection of skeletal remains for study in the laboratory. 300 were obtained from 50 sites; half of them from the Western Australian tour alone. Some results of his anatomical research into this material appear in his chapter in The Wild Canias (1975a: 101-5).</page><page sequence="54">130 Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK The accumulated data, comprising 4,000 pages of typescript, diagrams and maps, photographs (black and white and colour), anatomical observations, growth charts, colour changes etc. etc., chronological and palaeontological references in all available literature - both lay and scientific - from 1623 to the present, was originally destined to form a monograph for publication entitled "Canis antarticus Kerr (The Dingo)". However, following election to the Chair of Anatomy, pressure of administration, teaching and research, and of unavoidable obligations undertaken outside the Department, resulted in shelving the Dingo project in the hope of completing it in retirement. This cannot be, but Associate Professor Barker and Mrs. Macintosh have prepared for this Memorial series of articles a survey of some of that literature which was brought together by Mac, as well as of the latter's personal work on the dingo. Although Mac's mission was scientific, he was always willing to turn his attention to the practical aspects of his researches, as for example, in the forensic field. So too, in his study of the dingo: and indeed by doing this, he obtained the co-operation of those who were definitely hostile towards the animal. In an article, "Trail of the Dingo" (1956:8-12) in The Etruscan, which he wrote mainly with such readers in mind, he not only justified his many-sided investigations to the pastoralists who particularly required "some method of effective control, or preferably extermination", by reminding them that "to control or exterminate any parasitic or other plague it has always first been necessary to find out its identity, life history, and biological pattern" (ibid. 12). He also earlier in the article (ibid. 8) pointed out that "If sufficient records could be obtained throughout the continent it would almost certainly be possible to plot on a map the trends of movement of dingo populations and the time rhythm of their occurrence. Control measures could then be concentrated on limited areas at definite time periods which could probably be predicted." One of the interesting and much debated problems associated with the dingo is whether it can be domesticated. The Aborigines have had the longest association with it, and many reports were that it was both a domestic pet and an aid in hunting. The former attribute is correct, provided obedience and loyalty are not expected, but the latter is incorrect; to them it was a "blanket" on cold nights and an unfed companion (1975a:97). A very interesting part of the story of Mac and the dingo is not his usual persistent following of trails and gathering of evidence, but the scientific, Charles Darwin-like approach to which I referred with regard to some aspects of the Lake Nitchie burial. Mac, after advertisement, bought a litter of one male and three female very young pups. From these, four successive generations totalling 42 dingoes were inbred in captivity in the University of Sydney. Their life histories were recorded in sound and on film. "The alleged stigmata</page><page sequence="55">Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK 131 of domestication did not appear in any generation of our colony: all were in the upper size range of wild dingoes" (1975a: 95). Moreover, like K. Lorenz27 and police dog trainers in Sydney, Mac also failed to produce anything resem- bling obedience, and doesn't think that the level of association of dingo and man was any different when Aborigines brought it to Australia (1975a: 97). Macintosh's study of the dingo, however, was begun in 1949 "solely as an ancillary tool" in elucidating the region of origin or affinity of the Aborigines. A view held in the early 1920's was that the first Aboriginal immigrants brought the dingo with them. Our knowledge of human occupation of Australia has grown very greatly in the past 50 years, indeed in the past 20 or 30 years - and to that growth Macintosh contributed in outstanding and comprehensive manner; he both sowed seeds of this increase in knowledge and watered it by his gift for theorizing and by experimenting wherever possible. He also did some reaping. So here too, the dingo which did not get to Tasmania, "could not have arrived in Australia before 12,000 years ago when some sections of the Bass Strait causeway were flooded, and not before 8,000, or more probably 6,500 years ago, when Torres Strait flooding began, otherwise it would be found in New Guinea" (1977a). And it was not. Such was his summing up for the third edition of The Australian Encyclopaedia. Indeed, the dingo was brought across the water spaces to Australia by later immigrants some time between 12,000 and 6,500 years ago, probably by way of Indonesian Islands where in the Tengger Mountains of Java were the only dingo-like animals Mac could trace except possibly an existing dog of the Philippines (1974a:91~2). But the examination of an almost complete skeleton of a male dingo excavated at Fromm's landing, South Australia with a radiocarbon dating of about 3,000 years, revealed "a morphology identical with modern dingoes" (1977a: 9). No firm date earlier than this has yet been forthcoming. In Labours More Abundant ... in Journeyings Often This quotation (II Cor. χ 1:23, 26) summarizes Mac's career after, at the age of 37, he turned from the practice of medicine to University teaching and research. Although we were in close association throughout that period, his labours were even "more abundant and his journeyings more often" than I realized. The story I have told surely reflects a life of ceaseless activity, even though I have given few details of his continuing commitments in the Department of Anatomy until his retirement from it in 1973, and have made no reference to his journeys to Melbourne and New Zealand as examiner for the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, or to the several capital and other 27 Man meets Dog, 1954.</page><page sequence="56">132 Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK cities of Australia as guest lecturer, and I have only mentioned in passing his participation in Science Congresses. Mrs. Macintosh has very kindly extracted from Mac's notebooks and files summaries of his journeyings and labours, and made them available to me. The list of the ten 'trips' on Talgai research is so informative that I have added it as appendix to the section "On the Talgai Trail". In addition to them, there were the 1949 and 1952 expeditions to Arnhem Land, the Nuffield expeditions to the New Guinea Highlands in May-August, 1955 and in January-February 1957; and also prior to 1968 many archaeological field journeys to western New South Wales: Mt. Grenfell, Corinya, Hay, Mossgiel and Cohuna; long journeys on dingo "business" in 1953 and later; and survey journeys as President of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies in the Northern Territory and South Australia in 1967, in Western Australia in January 1969, and from October 25 to November 11, 1971, in North Queensland, the Northern Territory and elsewhere. I give as "Appendix A" Mrs. Macintosh's list for 1968-1975 with Mac's overseas journeys inserted. He had taken his first sabbatical leave (12 months) in 1965. Overseas, Mac was "in journeyings oft . . . and in labours abundant". Wherever he went, usually accompanied by Ann, he visited University Depart- ments of Anatomy, and examined both fossil and modern cranial and skeletal collections in whatever institutions they were kept: - in South and East Africa; from Syria in the Middle East to Holland and the United Kingdom in the West; in Czechoslovakia and the U.S.S.R. (including central Asia); in the United States of America, and across to Japan, Hong Kong, the Philippines and Java. He also visited fossil man sites where present in those countries; and cave-art sites in France and Spain. He attended International Conferences in Germany, the U.S.S.R., the U.S.A, South Africa, the Far East and in New Zealand; and was guest lecturer in five overseas countries. Mac's rewards were great, not only in what he saw, did and learnt, but also in the ever growing numbers of anthropological colleagues he made by his enthusiasm, wide knowledge, and gift for friendship in which he was so ably and happily helped by Ann. And the sequence: no distinguished physical anthropologist passed anywhere near Australia without coming to Sydney to see Mac. And usually he brought whoever it was to call on me at my Oceania Publications Department in the University of Sydney. As an "old man" in busy "retirement", I appreciated this action. I conclude this record of Mac's anthropological and archaeological labours by giving first, in Appendix B, a summary of his research plans which he drew up for an application in 1972 to the Australian Research Grants Committee for post-retirement assistance to complete the final stage of what he regarded as a 25-year research project. This is an important biographical document.</page><page sequence="57">Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK 133 It is fascinating in its forward planning and hindsight, and as a record of achievement on the way. In the second place I draw especial attention to the chapter on "Aboriginal affinities looked at in world context" by N. W. G. Macintosh and S. L. Larnach (1976:113-126) in the A.I.A.S. publication The Origin of the Australians. It gives Mac's last statement on this topic, a topic on which he had long set his sights. After a survey of the data both inside Australia and beyond, he and Larnach point to the startling possibility emerging that "southern China some 70,000 years ago was a common dispersal area for the earliest generalized type of H. sapiens sapiens and that radiating migrations were an exploding phenomenon of the warm Interstadial of 4-Wurm I and Π between 30,000 and 40,000 years ago" (1976: 124)28 But such moving off to the east would have experienced almost insuperable obstacles in finding "an ice-free corridor" to the American plains, while to the west the ice-sheets of the Central Asian plateau and mountain ranges would have barred the way. A more southerly route through India would have brought such migrating bands up against "the Neanderthal peoples of western Asia and Europe" ... To the south-west, however, by way of Indonesia, the Philippines and Sulawesi, the only hazard was "the sea crossing of the Wallace and Weber Deeps". And now comes the exciting prospect for Australianists: If further work in chronology and comparative anatomy should confirm this pattern, we could postulate the Aboriginal Australians as the earliest examples of evolving generalized Homo sapiens sapiens to arrive in their ultimate area of migration. This hypothesis would also explain why Australian Aboriginals have retained a moderately higher frequency of Homo erectus traits than other modern sapiens groups (1976:124). So the wheel turns, and we recognize the insights of those great anthro- pologists of 50 and 60 years ago: first, of Graf ton Elliot Smith who suggested the possibility of an Australoid progenitor as the ancestor of Homo sapiens, the bearers of Aurignacian culture in Europe, coming from Southern Asia; and second, of Arthur Keith whose views, as I remember so well in the 1920's, made news: that the Australian Aborigines represented to-day the stock from whom all types of modern man have descended.29 The Final Journey - Farewell From the outline of his career that I have given, Mac stands forth intellect- ually keen and capable of long hours of intensive work. He was usually full 28 B. Kurten, Pleistocene mammals of Europe. (1968:20): for date of Interstadial of Wurm HI. ^Macintosh and Larnach refer to these authors - G. E.

MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK of life and spirit, and on the exterior he seemed to some at times to be rough and One of the boys', but deep down he was a good fellow, straight and true, exuberant yet solid in his personal relationships. The outward bravado cloaked a very complex personality. Behind the ebullience was a nervous retreat of which he was only too conscious and about which he spoke to me early in our association. At times he became very depressed, but after talking it out, he rose up as it were and went on his course. After retirement from the Chair of Anatomy he planned a work room and laboratory in his own delightful home on Bellevue Hill. In addition he accepted the use of one room in the Department of Surgery and another in my Department of Oceania Publications in the Mackie Building. He hoped to spend two or three hours daily in each of these rooms and in so far as the Institute of Aboriginal Studies and other commitments allowed, he did this. Gradually, however, his health began to falter. Diagnosis was a long time coming, though he suspected and indeed anticipated the verdict. When after an operation on 23rd March, 1977 that verdict was given, he accepted the inevitable: the discomfort, the suffering, the increasing weakness; and as Ann put it afterwards "the humiliating physical and mental destruction wrought by this terrible disease". At the same time, he tried to follow the course of development of the disease, hoping to redeem the time by completing personal and family affairs, which he did and to write a few letters. Even a few weeks before his death he prepared a critique for me of a paper submitted for publication in our Journal. After that exploratory and palliative operation in March, 1977, Mac became more and more housebound, and dependent on his wife - by day and night. For his strength failed. Except when I was myself hospitalized in August and recuperating slowly in September, I visited him about every couple of weeks, if he felt well enough to talk with me. He also, if possible, spoke to me on the 'phone whenever I rang to inquire. And almost to within three weeks from the end, I sensed that he was still trying with Ann's help U&gt; cope with arrears of correspondence. We sat and he talked, and on my leaving, he always walked, whatever the effort, to the top of his verandah steps and saw me get into the car. On the 11th November, however, he was in bed. He had accepted medication to ease the pain, but that morning, so Ann told me on arrival, he was determined to remain awake until I had been and gone; for this would probably be farewell. He managed to do this, but his voice was very weak. Ann offered me a cup of tea, and to her surprise he whispered that he would have one too; and so he and I had another cup of tea together, the last of hundreds during the preceding 33 years - in our Departments, in Arnhem Land, in our homes. And so I left him, sinking back into sleep and nearing the end</page><page sequence="59">Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK 135 of his final journey. Less than three weeks later I gave, at his request through Ann, the Address at the Crematorium Service. I have quoted from it here.30 Mac was fond of boats and their way upon the water. This was an old interest; he expressed it in an ANZAAS paper in 1949 on the original people of Tasmania (1949c: 123-44). And he dared think of the Aborigines as the world's first mariners: the first of them coming to Australia between 30,000 and 40,000 years ago, had to cross water spaces. Moreover, he had hoped in retirement to sail in old-time craft along the shores north of Australia. This hope was rekindled by his meeting Mr. Allen O'Brien, of Los Angeles, a successful entrepreneur, who disposed of his business at the peak and put his unbounded energy and ever-green interests into prehistory, especially Early American; he was also an original contributor to, and First President of, the Leakey Foundation. He became an inveterate adventure-type traveller, going to out of the way places by any and all means of movement, including sailing ships. He joined a syndicate which bought and put in sailing order an old brigantine, Eye of the Wind, manned it, and sent it on a cruise filled with expense-paying passengers. On the 1st September, 1977, Mac, already very weak, wrote to Mr. O'Brien that, using a telescope he had watched from his front porch. for half an hour "Eye of the Wind" coming up the harbour slowly in a light variable wind of only one or two knots - "surrounded by small sailing craft" - wearing exactly the same suit of sails as in your postcard: flying, outer and inner jibs; fore t'gall.s'l, upper fore and lower fore topsails, foresail; main t'gall stays'l, main topmast stays'l; main gaff topsail and spanker; and red ensign aft. O'Brien's reply to Mac, written on 3rd October - every line of it - thrilled him, and me too, because of the thrill it gave Mac. He replied to O'Brien in reminiscent vein on the 15th October, in a long letter from which I give the following extract: Some time after 1937 and before World War II I was pottering about the eastern Mediterranean and was lucky enough to see a Ruad Coaster being careened. The He de Ruad south of Latakia built 200 ton two masted schooners in a small shipyard in about 1880, and continued until 1920 or even 1930. I don't think any have been built since then, but a few are still sailing for cargo or sponge fishing, perhaps smuggling, years old but still seaworthy. Only about 70 feet long at water line, they were sturdy, a bit beamy, with a very massive bowsprit making them look shorter. All wood and fully decked, they had two raked polemasts; fully cargo loaded, they sat low in the water, but in spite of that stability they needed check tackles in addition to two helmsmen on the colossal tiller (no wheel) to maintain course in heavy weather. Bottom cleaning was not done on skid cradles. Instead the ship just lay over under mast belay ropes, when the tide went down. The bottom was then drenched with kerosene and lit. All barnacles, weeds, fungus, and rubbish burnt off and •°The University News, March 6, 1978, pp. 3 and 10.</page><page sequence="60">136 Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK the wooden hulls did not even scorch. Unfortunately I don't know what wood they were made of, but obviously a wooden hull does not burn as easily as most people think. A very important point, if one is thinking about Early Man, is what sort of watercraft and what materials he might have used. Auxiliary engines were introduced to the Ruad coasters, I don't know when; usually a Sulzer auxiliary what that may be, but it gave the craft 6 knots without sails, which was very useful in cargo transport and saving time between Naples and Alexandria, although mostly between the smaller ports on the Levant Coast, when the wind failed . . . Apart from Heyerdahl and some who copied his feats no one has tried to learn about what kind of sea craft could have been used. Heyerdahl came up with the balsa raft. Others who have copied him successfully have modified some of the woods in centre-boards, etc. Heyerdahl then used 2 different kinds of papyrus from two different regions to cross the Atlantic. On his first Atlantic trip he discovered the technical function of all the stays, bundles, loading and what alternative wood to use for steering oars and so on. It was one thing to copy minutely and exactly everything engraved on Egyptian tombs, but quite another thing to know what they were all supposed to do. On his second Atlantic trip he realized from his first that he was dealing with highly sophisticated marine design and architecture where every item had its own essential function. Now Heyerdahl is building a reed boat in accordance with ancient design to go down the Tigris to the Red Sea. That is where the Ruad Coaster interests me. What sort of wood goes into those hulls which does not burn when flooded with lit kerosene. I've seen a lot of weird interesting so-called primitive craft in odd corners of the world and sailed in two of them. Imagine a research project of 3 years up and down the coasts and waterways of S.E. Asia to find the total range of materials and designs. That would mean looking at all vegetation there now, and then finding some climatologist cum geographer cum botanist to tell one what was available 30,000 years ago. That was just another pipe dream for my retirement. Now nothing. But someone else might try, the answer is probably just lying round waiting to be seen. We already know balsa, papyrus and reeds as genuinely seaworthy capable craft. Ah well. All success to your own current projects; I can't see them failing. But for Mac his hope of sailing again passed on November 27, 1977, into the world of mythology; as I concluded in my crematorium address: "with Charon he crosses the Styx and himself drinks in 'large forgetful draughts of the Lethaean flood to steep the cares of past labours and irksome years'. (This, from Virgil's Aeneid, Book 6, which Mac liked). Well, may be! But we will not forget Mac, nor Ann who now steps out alone but yet may not be alone; as Whitman wrote, Ί cannot answer the question of identity beyond the grave, but I am satisfied - he, ahold of my hand, has completely satisfied me'."

APPENDIX Β Summary of 8-Stage Research Plan EXTRACT FROM: Application made in 1972 to Australian Research Grants Committee for post-retirement assistance to complete Stage 8 of a 25 year research project. TITLE: The anatomical interpretation of Aboriginal prehistory and probably a contribution to Aboriginal affinity and origin. AIM: Definitive and conclusive anatomical interpretation of the Talgai, Cohuna, Keilor, Mossgiel, Lake Nitchie, Palawan (Philippines) human fossil skeletal remains, and determination of the degree of their morphological inheritance from Homo erectus and other ancient types from S.E. Asia.</page><page sequence="62">138 Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK RESEARCH PLAN: Although this is an initial application for grant, I designed the plan for this project about 25 years ago. While the strategy and tactics have altered following new techniques, new discoveries, and colleagues acquired overseas, the main strategy has been pursued consistently. My first paper on this project was published in 1949. I have produced 4 mono- graphs, a book chapter, some 40 papers, 2 one-hour documentary TV films in Australia and appeared in one in Czechoslovakia, and have lectured in Leningrad, Moscow, Brno, Prague, Paris, Johannesburg, and Universities of Harvard, Brown, Michigan, Chicago, and Arizona in the U.S.A., and taken part in discussions in London, Washington, Philadelphia, New York, San Francisco, Honolulu and in Tokyo and Kyoto on this subject. The research project was designed in 8 Stages, as follows: - STAGE 1: To collect and test all information and hypotheses existing on the extant fossils (Australian). (I have shown most of this to be invalid and am well advanced with new interpretations and proof). STAGE 2: To analyse modern regional aboriginal skeletal remains as a framework control for comparison with the prehistoric remains. (This has been completed for Coastal N.S.W., Queensland, the Keppel Islands, and a New Guinea series). STAGE 3: To re-locate and re-excavate the original sites of discovery and by sophisticated radiocarbon, neutron activation, proton beam and trace element analyses, prove the stratificatory loci and directly or indirectly date the fossil relics. (This has been completed for Keilor, it has 12,800 years antiquity. Talgai is partly solved, having a minimal antiquity of 16,000 years. Cohuna and Mossgiel proceed). STAGE 4: To seek and excavate additional relics. (In January, 1970 I excavated a skeleton at Lake Nitchie which exhibits 6 unique and 4 rare findings for Australia, including a pierced tooth necklace of the extinct Sarcophilus barrisi. This skeleton is precisely dated at 6820 years, and published). STAGE 5: A world-wide 12 months personal examination of humanoid fossils in Africa, Western Europe, Middle East, U.S.A. (This was carried out in 1965. In 1968 ditto for Japan, 2 weeks, and in 1970 ditto for Eastern Europe, Russia, Central Asia and U.S.A., 3 months.) STAGE 6: In addition to studying overseas fossils firsthand, I brought back techniques in casting, and fossil cleaning. My technicians now produce casts which are unique in the world (simultaneous external and internal cranial replication). (These tech- niques have been applied to the Australian fossils and to fossils from the Philippines.) STAGE 7: To inter-relate the Australian fossils with overseas fossils. (Two papers have already been published, 3 more await publication.) STAGE 8: I need to see and study personally the skeletal material and sites in Java and the Philippines, and further to work on 3 new sites in western N.S.W. which I have not yet revealed, and one site in Arnhem Land which I was asked to report on for the N.T. Administration. (Three of my papers indirectly and one directly, link the Australian fossils with Javan fossils. I have almost completed work on a jaw bone (mandible) brought to me from Palawan, which I identify as affined with Australians rather than any other race. I believe I can claim 10 original contributions, including discoveries). Practical application, additional to academic contribution : The political implications of an Aboriginal minority are more significant than as of 5 years ago, and will become more so. I believe one very important obligation upon us, is to provide the Aboriginals with their own history. Already we know that with</page><page sequence="63">Ν. W. G. MACINTOSH AND HIS WORK 139 a time depth of 3 0,0 CO years (proved) and possibly much more, it is far longer than our own known history. (I said this in an invitation Oration in Perth in 1969 (published), and two weeks ago was summoned to give opinion similarly to Federal Senate Standing Committee on the Environment). Essentially Stage 8 is the penultimate (perhaps ultimate) of the earlier steps in my project design, and for this I seek the grant. My overseas travels were financed from my salary plus normal University travel grant. My Australian field trips were easily encompassed by internal University Research Grants because I do my field work usually with one, and never more than 4 technical assistants from my Department, whom I have trained. I do not use tents or elaborate field accessories. Transport has been via University vehicle or my own car. (The Talgai Skull documentary colour film was an exception - 34 people were involved, but the A.B.C, financed that.) I need to explain that I retire from my Chair in 1972. I have one major problem - expertise facilities. I have trained my own technicians in photographic colour processing (at a tenth of commercial cost), in sophisticated casting media, and in draftsmanship. This expertise with skeletal material cannot be provided by any other personnel in Australia. Hence I will need to pay them part time in their own free time and pay for materials used. TIME TO COMPLETE PROJECT: Probably three to five years to complete my original goals towards which I have been working for 25 years. But in the first instance, I visualize study and examination of sites and materials in Java (two months) and in the Philippines (one month), two weeks each of field work on three sites in western N.S.W., completion of radiocarbon and other tests, some laboratory work and subsequent publications. (No salary is requested, only expenses are sought.) (signed) N.W.G.M. 1972. Note: Following submission of the above application to ARGC in 1972 a grant for 1973 was made, but deferred to 1974 by N.W.G.M. A further nine papers directly applicable to the project were published. A final paper relevant to the project appears in this Volume, and a general condensed summary covering Aboriginal antiquity and affinities was published in the Australian Encyclopaedia in July 1977.
