<plain_text><page sequence="1">FURTHER UNPUBLISHED EXAMPLES OF ROCK-ART FROM NORTHERN RHODESIA J. H. CHAPLIN Formerly Inspector of Monuments, Livingstone, Northern Rhodesia This paper is to be considered as a continuation of an earlier one in this Bulletin (Chaplin, 1960). The interest in schematic art is in its appeal to one's curiosity rather than aesthetic sense. The more we can publish the more likelihood there is that parallels with other areas will be seen, and also other forms of ornamentation which may lead us to an understanding of the symbolism involved. A design that suggests fertility, for example, may have the same meaning whether found on rock, hut-wall, or pot, or as scarification on the body. For example in Uganda wall-paintings, the 'target' represents a hut roof; the 'spiral' depicts hair styles (Sekintu and Wachsmann, 1960). The following reproductions and notes concern the paintings copied during 1960. Nyambwezu Stream (1125 C4)1 From the main road that connects Solwezi with Mwinilunga there is a well-marked side road leading to the Kabompo Gorge; 12 5 km. along this secondary road there is a turning to the right that leads for some 2 km. through the forest to a waterfall on the Nyambwezu stream. On the further side of the fall, facing 114?, there is a slight overhang hidden by thick vegetation. The whole vertical face is haphazardly pitted with deeply punched dots. Figure la shows the sole pecked shape and some of the pittings. As well as these punctured designs, there are numerous finely incised lines, a small selection of which is shown in the same figure. Both in general form and actual content these latter are very similar to the engravings reported by Breuil (1952) at Kiantopo (1025 Bl) 200 km. away to the north-north-east. The ladder-like design (top left) closely resembles his figure 87 of Plate II, even to the failure of the cross horizontals to meet the edges. A fuller study of this shelter is planned, as at present lichen and swallows' nests obscure much of the rock face. Chitungulu Hill (1225 B2) At a point 112 km. from Solwezi on the main road to Mwinilunga, a road turns north for 20 km. to the court of Chief Mukumbi Lubinga. From here a fast-degenerating track passes through the village of Pakamabwe to the foot of this hill, 28 km. from the court. The rock face on which the engravings are cut is about 15 m. high and faces 180? at the crest of the hill. It slopes outwards but offers no shelter suitable for occupation as a great tumble of boulders lies at its foot. Figure lb includes all the engravings, except for four similar semicircles to the west of the main group. Those omitted are uncoloured, the remainder all have traces of red pigment. The two speckled designs are painted only, with no trace of graving beneath them and, though of the same colour, would seem to be later. Just below the rocks at the foot of the rock-face, is a small shelter less than 2 m. high; within it and difficult to see, are two lines of deeply cut oval dots (5 x 2 mm.); the upper row has seven, the lower, seventeen. Ndumbwa Hill (1226 A4) 12 km. east of Solwezi, on the road leading to Chingola, there is a turning south that passes through the village of Chief Kapiji Mpanga. About 26 km. from this turn-off the road The positions of the sites are indicated here by their grid references. Each degree-square is defined by the parallel of latitude forming its northern border, and the meridian of longitude forming its western border. Each such square is then divided into quadrants: A, B, C, D (being north-west, north-east, south-west and south-east), which are again subdivided into four parts: 1, 2, 3, 4, in the same order. S. Afr. Archaeol. Bull. 17 (65), p1. I-II, pp. 5-13.</page><page sequence="2">ends at a dambo, on the other side of which rises Ndumbwa Hill, a group with several peaks. Towards the western end is an extensive rock shelter facing 335?. Here there is the rather fresh-looking 'inverted ice-pick' design shown in figure Ic and numerous dots and strokes besides. Quartz chips and potsherds denote past occupation of the site, and it will probably be excavated in the not too distant future. Kalelanguni Hill (1230 C4) This hill lies beyond a dambo at a point some 2 6 km. to the west of the junction of the Mkuku and Great North roads, north of Serenje. Towards the north-west end of the ridge there is a low shelter, facing 190?, in which there are no surface indications of occupation. Although the shelter itself is hardly tall enough for a crouched man, the main rock face is bigger. There are a few faded paintings here in orange/red (fig. Id). The most distinct are the parts of a series of concentric curves with some ill-defined lines close to them. A hoe-like representation can be seen to the right and above these. Some 50 cm. to the left of the'hoe' (moved closer-in for the convenience of illustration) may be seen a figure that may be a stylized elephant. Chipangale (1332 B1) This resettlement area lies to the west of the road linking Fort Jameson with Lundazi; the access road is 122 km. south of the latter. During the course of surveying this district a number of painting sites were found which may conveniently be dealt with under one heading.' (a) This site is on a rock cluster only a few metres high; on the side facing 0900 there are a few faded red designs, mostly gridirons, of which only that shown in figure 1 e was clear enough to copy. It bears a close affinity to the Sezamanja painting shown in figure 3c and also to a painting at the Mwela Rocks site at Kasama (Walton, 1958), which is c. 350 km. to the north-west across the Luangwa Valley. It is possible that the present painting is a degenerate copy of the same 'trapped-bird' motif, and that the tailed circle below it is a string-gin, but this must remain a speculation only, until similar paintings are found in the intervening areas. (b) Kongwe Hill (1332 B2) is a large granite dome rising conspicuously above the surrounding forest; a long platform, facing 320?, runs along one side with a high sloping rock face behind it. Flaking has destroyed parts of the complex of gridirons at this site, but the damage is shown dotted in figure If. The colour is the common red-brown with a little weathering to a deeper shade here and there. (c) A sloping rock wall runs for some 35 in., rising in parts to as much as 15 m. high; it faces 305?. At its foot are two openings, too small for a person to crouch in. Here were found pieces of iron slag, and several sherds; it may have been a place for making primitive gunshot from iron smelted elsewhere. Figure ig shows the main painting on this rock face, though other long strips exist, some of them extending to at least 3 m. above the present ground surface. The common red-brown pigment has been used, with here and there a rock-wash changing this to a more purple shade. Interesting comments were offered by elderly men of the area on seeing the reproductions. Although they had no knowledge of any tradition of painting, they thought that the very long strips represented sinews being hung up to dry. They suggested the very broad strokes were elephants' rib-bones which in this area are still sometimes used as tools. The shorter bones (Nkobo) were used as ordinary hammers, and the curved ones (Nkobali) for beating fibres. 2 A detailed map of these sites is available for inspection at the offices of the National Monuments Commission, Livingstone, Northern Rhodesia. 6</page><page sequence="3">a Jcm,~ f\~C C~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~a cm. p U.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~cn h ~~~~~ ~Fig. 1.</page><page sequence="4">Chayingo (1332 C3) The Cewa village of Masinja lies 20 km. to the north of the Great East Road connecting Fort Jameson with Katete, the turn-off being 24 km. east of the latter place. From the village a track of about 1P5 km.. leads to a small koppie in the forest. On a rock, facing 2050, are a considerable number of paintings mainly in white pigment. The most conspicuous of these figures is the crocodile seen in figure lh (but see appendix). Under each upper limb can be seen a crescent. The top left-hand corner is occupied by a hoe, while a poor imitation of it has been made lower down. What may be an axe-blade lies between the two left limbs. To the right of the tail is a wheel-like design, and a further hoe (though this has an unexplained appendage). There are three adze-like paintings and a pair of wide crescents reversed against each other. A large and very careless figure can just be imagined as having animal-like outlines, but the imagination has to be stretched rather far. Some interesting comparisons can be made between this group of paintings and the wall decorations of Tanganyika snake charmers recorded by Cory (1953). His plate I(a) shows a far more realistic crocodile with open jaws and jointed, toed, limbs, but the lines of dots for scales are a conspicuous feature of this painting. A hoe is mentioned above with an unexplained appendage. Cory tells us that puzzle pictures are quite common in the group he is describing. He shows an axe (No. VI, p. 97) with a number of meaningless additions to confuse the main shape. Such parallels should be kept in mind when the time comes to consider the wider implications of this symbolic rock-art. I am indebted to Dr. R. J. Apthorpe for the appended note concerning the paintings that are used in connexion with girls' puberty rites among the Nsenga, who live in much the same area as the Cewa. His animal identifications are important. Part of the main crocodile design overlies a series of more abstract patterns which can be seen in figure 1 i. Earliest of these is a gridiron, now faded purple and represented in the figure in dashed outline. Next is the loop and series of curves in a rust brown pigment shown as speckled. The largest, and latest before the crocodile, is an indistinct pattern of alternating black and yellow curves, indicated here by black and clear lines. This closely resembles one of the out-of-reach paintings at Mukomra (see Plates I and II A). The right-hand upper limb of the main saurian figure that has been superimposed on these earlier ones is shown in dotted outline. Another group of similar figures lies to the right of the main complex. The distance of the left end of the upper limb from the right edge of the 'wheel' is about 45 cm. The main crocodile figure is in white, and over its lower right-hand limb there has been a further plastering of white pigment, shown in dotted outline in figure 1j. The clear vertical gridiron pattern is an older one in a faded purple pigment and the central portion of it is indistinguish- able. All the other designs are in white. There are two figures that may be hoes; a gong (?) and one medium sized and two small, badly made, copies of the main figure. What appears to be an axe-overlying the lower gridiron-is partly indistinct. A large, coarse, horizontal grid and indeterminate hook complete the figure. Some 50 cm. above the topmost pattern are the designs shown in figure 2a; these are in a pale orange pigment. A further site is on the west side of the same rocky mass as the crocodile figures already illustrated (figure 2b). The lowest edge of the designs is about 1-8 m. above the ground surface, but boulders make it possible to reach the paintings which are in a deep rusty-red pigment that is almost plum colour. It is not clear whether the arcs of the lowest pattern meet or not; it is probable that they were intended to, but if so the pigment has quite disappeared. Masinja School (1332 C3) This school lies a little before the village of the same name; behind it rises a rocky hill near the crest of which is a smooth vertical rock surface facing 1600. Here are two faint designs 8</page><page sequence="5">ci ~~~~~~~~~~~~~- Xrr . C~~~ 10~ ~~v4 C' ran~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~a Gore _tfE s0.

The lower edge of the thick ladder-like pattern is indistinct. Mukoma (1332 C3) This site, also known as Old's Farm, has a number of rock koppies; the turning to it lies on the west of the road leading to Chayingo about 1 5 km. from the Great East Road. One of these has on its eastern side a fine rock shelter which may be seen in Plate I. There are a considerable number of paintings at this site, many of which are faded; washed out by water running over them, or inaccessible owing to their height above the ground. Potsherds and scattered charcoal indicate occupation of this shelter, as do local legends. There is a story concerning this shelter that it was occupied by an outlaw, who used it as a base from which to operate, and in which he made bullets. Some of the white drawings were made by him to while away the time, using a pigment made from pounded snail shells. This may only be a story made to fit facts, but is recorded here for what it is worth. A selection of paintings from this site is illustrated in the following figures. Figure 2d shows a white gridiron, with a small circle in the same colour overlying it. This lies 14 m. above the ground. Above this and out of reach are several vertical gridiron patterns in black, in places outlined in yellow. Figure 2e lies a metre to the north of the preceding illustration, the crude human figure is in white and the ends of all four limbs (?) are indistinct. Some 12 cm. below this figure are a faint axe (?) and a partly faded target of black and white curves, shown with colours reversed in figure 2f. Figure 2g represents a group 125 m. farther north. A barely distinguishable deep red design is superimposed on one end of the upper of two piebald tabard-like figures, but underlies part of the lower. The dexter ends of both have been obliterated by rain-wash, though faint white dashes are apparent; when complete these may well have been axe-shapes. Black in the figure represents white on the rock; the orange-yellow areas have been left clear, while the red is shown in dotted outline. The lower anthropomorphic patterns are mostly in a rather dirty white, while the figure in dashed outline is more nearly grey. In almost every case the ends are indefinite. Figures 2h and i are taken from a group of paintings a farther metre northwards, between two rain-streaks. The head of (a) just touches the lower part of the gridiron in (b). The paintings are all in white, with the exception of the vertical-grid which has been outlined in black, shown here as a dashed line. Below and to the left of the crocodile figure is a confused mass of lines among which are an 'axe', and a Greek cross. Some 35 cm. beyond the more northerly rain-streak are two human figures shown in figure 2j; both are in white. Not shown in the figure but above and to the left of the upper human is a large filled circle, while the head of the lower, eared, figure is superimposed on what may be the handle of an axe, though the sinister portion has been washed away. A representation of ears is very rare, so much so that one wonders if this is, in point of fact, the correct interpretation. They might be medicine horns. A rock break separates this group from another too high for copying, but which includes a further white 'axe' and a crocodile with very long tail in a biscuit shade. The most northerly of the paintings are also the highest and are quite out of reach; they are, however, shown in Plate IL A. Some idea of size may be given from the fact that the lowest pattern is some 50 cm. high; all are in white with an outlining of sooty brown that has in places almost weathered to purple; the shooting star is similarly black and white. Mboza Hill (1332 D4) On maps this is sometimes spelt Mbozi; it forms a conspicuous mass to the north of the road leading east from Chadiza to Nyasaland some 50 km. east of the former and can best be reached by a forty-minute walk from Kapandula Village. There is a fine rock shelter some 15 m. long with a high gently sloping rock face giving shelter for a depth of about 4 5 m. 10</page><page sequence="7">The site faces 2150 over thickly wooded country. Not only were sherds collected from this site, but several inverted pots were left in place close to the foot of the wall. The present occupants of the area deny that this was a sacrificial place, but it seems highly likely that this was the case. Unless notes are made to the contrary the colour used throughout this series of paintings is the faded red that at times becomes purple. None of the paintings is very distinct and where doubt exists as to outlines, a dashed line has been used. Figure 2k illustrates a group of paintings, copied some 5 m. from the eastern side. An interesting feature is the presence of vertical strokes in grid-iron pattern, rather than the more usual enclosed design, of which there are, however, several examples. Some 30 cm. to the west of the preceeding figure is a fairly clear gridiron shown in figure 21. Above and slightly to the left of this are some paintings, too indistinct for reproduction, that appear to have been made with a rough brush; there is none of the smoothness of edge of the majority of lines, they may in fact be 'cleaning strokes' as they appear to form no pattern at all. A further 2 5 m. to the west comes figure 2m, with the familiar target and gridiron combined in one pattern. This is on that part of the rock face between two of the upturned pots previously mentioned; the third pot lies a further 3 m. west, and this is below figure 2n. In this group the lower of the two vertical gridirons has been overlaid by a white figure shown in the illustration in dashed outline. Sakwe (1432 A2) It is not too easy to pinpoint this locality, as an area, a village and a hill all appear to have the same name though all are about 13 km. south-west of Chadiza. The actual site is on the south-west side of a hill some 15 km. from a village known as Lundu Aron. This is the same site as that shown in Plate 106 of Summers's work (Summers, 1959), where the photo- graphic plate does not seem to have been able to pick out all the detail. In that report Zingalume village is given as being 5 km. to the west-north-west of the site. There are also other sites in the vicinity, of which I have been shown photographs. Figure 3a shows as much of the design as can be copied; at the very top is an oval gridiron that extends beyond reach. For the most part the colour of the pigment is red, in places washed a little to brown. There is a tectiform more 'hut-like' than many of its kind, but still hardly representational. The varying gridiron forms are more complex than many others, and some have digital appendages at the top. On the right-hand side of the figure there is a rather deeper purply-red crocodile overlying two faded red gridirons, shown clear in the figure. The outline of the crocodile has been filled in with clay, presumably comparatively recently as otherwise it would have flaked off on drying. A rock break spoils the upper left limb, and there are indefinite endings to other lines close by. The designs tend to end in long stretches with what can only be called 'bobbles' at the end. Behind the crocodile are some faint black lines that appear to form a gridiron, but are too faint to copy. Set apart from the main pattern area are the two designs shown in figure 3b; that on the left is in the same red-brown shade as the main paintings, while that on the right is in black; the handles of both fade into obscurity. Sezamanja (1432 A2) Some 16 km. to the north-west of Chadiza, beyond the Nsadzu stream, lies the farm of Mr. J. Thornicroft, which has on it several rocky outcrops. The isolated koppie on which these paintings are to be found has a number of vertical surfaces on the northern face. Figure 3c shows the more easterly group where there are two fairly clear circles filled with interlacing, as well as several forms only the outline of which can be seen. In one instance the superimposi- tion of the clearer form is obvious. Close to these is a long vertical gridiron pattern with a curious appendage at the lower left-hand end. Moving some five metres to the west we find :1:1</page><page sequence="8">C . 0 4~~~~~~~~~~1 r ~ ~ ~~~d e Fig. 3. other paintings, which, like those already described, are in a faded red pigment, though where water had dripped down the walls the colour is more purple in shade. Figure 3d shows a crocodile-like figure of which the caudal end is indistinct. Some 40 cm. above the left arm of this figure is a circular gridiron that is interesting in that it seems to have been painted between two occurrences of exfoliation. The dotted line marks the limit of one such scar and the pattern continues over this, only to be broken by further flaking. A careful search among the talus failed to discover any painted spalls. Some 55 cm. farther west are other patterns shown in figure 3e where some reduction of the distance between the two designs has been made (in the original X and Y are separated by a distance of 31 cm.). The centre of the lower figure is indistinct. There are a few other lines and curves too faint to copy. If the circles with interlacing at this site are intended to represent traps, then they are well placed, as several traps and snares were found set around the hill which is clearly inhabited by varieties of small animals. A NOTE ON NSENGA GIRLS' PUBERTY DESIGNS RAYMOND APTHORPE Rock-art in Nsenga country, in eastern Northern Rhodesia, does not at present play any part in girls' puberty ceremonies. 12</page><page sequence="9">In any case the Nsenga believe rock-paintings in the country were made perhaps by the Twa or Twa-like people, long ago, about whom they know practically nothing except that they were of short stature. Nsenga for 'rock-painting' is ndembo, a word usually used for body scarifications, the results of medication, or sheer erotic ornamentation. The images in the photographs, which are essential features of Nsenga puberty ceremonies, are called vilengo. The genet cat (nsimba) is a significant symbol in Nsenga puberty ceremonies. It represents the male principle, and potency. It is shown in Plate II B, made on a tree. It is not a crocodile; 'the crocodile with ears' in Mr. Chaplin's drawing may (or may not) be a genet. Genets are meaningful not only in Nsenga ceremonies. The Luvale say 'the genet has climbed the tree' and the flesh of genet is among the meats forbidden to Luvale (boy and girl) novices. (White, 1961.) 1 do not know at present whether the Nsenga representation on a tree is significant. Plate II C shows a schematic design made on the ground, in white meal (the genet has red and white spots). The colours red and white commonly connote, roughly speaking, the female and male principles. The Nsenga perpetuate this symbolism consciously. I have seen schematics like that illustrated at all (four) puberty ceremonies I have observed. The markings, though they are made with great deliberation, by the senior officiating woman usually, do not seem to be traced according to any exact formula. Their purpose generally is as a mnemonic device, but if the design is carried out creatively it is admired for that in itself. The novice is led round the roughly circular cilengo, her feet being guided so that for the most part she does not step on any marking. In one case the instructress told me that certain parts of the design (which was in slight clay relief) represented hills (which in Nsenga puberty ceremonial are said to image the mons pubis); and other parts crocodiles, a male and a female. In another case the instructress said merely 'we make vilengo because our ancestors did so', and to my question answered that she did not know whether different parts of the schematic 'meant' anything. The lessons this design holds include that intercourse must be avoided at menstruation periods, and that the girl should beware of adulterous advances. A large repertoire of visual representations may be selected in puberty ceremonies among the Nsenga and many other central African Bantu peoples. An account of Nsenga practices and symbolism in detail will be published probably next year by the Rhodes-Livingstone Institute or Museum. Illustrations of Bemba schematics are given by Richards (1956) but of that aspect of Bemba puberty ceremonies she records no details.
