<plain_text><page sequence="1">SATAN'S FALL AND THE "QUAESTIO DE AQUA ET TERRA"* IN HIS definitive study of the authenticity of the Quaestio de aqua et terra, contained in the second series of his Studies in Dante (Oxford, 1899), Dr. Edward Moore came to this conclusion: Unless some far more conclusive evidence of forgery is forthcoming than has yet been advanced, I shall unhesitatingly believe this to be a genuine work of Dante, corrupted possibly in some of its detail, but still in all essential points the production of the same mind and pen to which we owe the Divina Commedia, the De Monarchia, and the Oonvito. [p. 3561 If Dr. Moore were alive today, he would have no reason to change his mind for having read Professor Nardi's book, "La caduta di Lucifero," the latest challenge to the work's authenticity, for it produces nothing that might be called "evidence," and its author makes no attempt to shoulder the burden of proof which, since Moore's study, necessarily rests with those who claim the work is a forgery. Instead, he finds that some of the scientific and philo- sophical principles contained in the Quaestio differ greatly from those expressed or implied in the Divine Comedy, and bases his argument completely upon this divergence. Most of the previous arguments against the work's authenticity were linked to the contention that it was in fact a forgery perpe- trated in 1508 by Giovanni Moncetti, who claimed to have dis- covered a manuscript (now lost) from which he published the Quaestio as we know it. After the cursus analyses of E. Parodi and Paget Toyn"iee, however, and the recent work of F. Mazzoni (Stud. dant. XXIV), it became impossible to believe that the work had been written after the middle of the fourteenth century. Now, on the basis of exhaustive research into the history of the scientific question (the really valuable portion of this book), Professor Nardi readily concedes that the work was written before 1350, thereby exonerating Moncetti and charging the forgery to one of the poet's contemporaries: . . mi vado sempre di pid convincendo che la Quaestio de aqua et terra sia una falsificazione bella e buona, ad opera di un filosofo im- * Bruno Nardi, La Caduta di Lucifero e l'autenticita della "Quaestio de Aqua ef terra", Lectura Dantis Romana (Rome, 1959), 67 pp. 99</page><page sequence="2">100 ITALICA bevuto di teologia, al quale premeva di rimettere in onore la teoria della gibbositas egidiana [i.e., Egidio Romano's] ormai in discredito. L'epoca del falso potrebbe fissarsi fra il 1330 e il 1350, o forse anche un po' piii tardi, ma certo negli anni nei quali la fama di Dante s'andava sempre piii diffondendo . . . attribuirla a Dante poteva essere un modo per assicurare alla Quaestio un largo successo. If this was indeed the motive for the forgery, we may add paren- thetically that the operation was singularly unsuccessful in its most crucial phase, the divulgation of the work, for the treatise all but disappeared until it was discovered by Moncetti. On the other hand, its disappearance is no argument against its authenticity; the Quaestio's publication in 1508 preceded that of the De Vulgari eloquentia by twenty-one years, of the De Monarchia by fifty-one, and of the Vita Nuova by about seventy (Moore, p. 309). Professor Nardi's argument, buttressed by discussions as subtle and profound as only Italy's foremost authority on Dante's phi- losophy could write, leans too heavily upon the rather naive critical assumption that two ostensibly conflicting theses could not have been proposed by the same man. There seems to be no doubt that there is a discrepancy between the Quaestio's account of the forma- tion of the hemisphere of land, and the account given in the last canto of the Inferno, from which one might at best insist that the question of the work's authenticity be kept open (cfr. Moore, p. 355). Professor Nardi, perhaps because his work is polemically directed, overstates his case, and seems to feel that the discrepancy is decisive for his argument. It is our contention that it is not. The argument of the treatise may be summarized as follows: given that the spheres of the four elements are arranged concen- trically outside of one another in their natural places (traditionally in the order Earth, Water, Air, and Fire), how is it that the habit- able land obviously rises above the level of the water? Is one therefore to conclude that the natural place of the land is higher than that of the water? The treatise answers in the negative in order to defend the traditional belief in the concentricity of earth and water. It seeks to explain the deviation by suggesting rather that the habitable portion of the earth (quarta habitabilis) rises in the northern hemisphere out of the water (and out of its natural place) in the shape of a hump (gibbositas). This protuberance was necessary so that there might be a place for all the elements to meet and combine into every possible form, and it was brought</page><page sequence="3">SATAN'S FALL AND THE "QUAESTIO DE AQUA ET TERRA 101 into being by the power of the stars, whose influence is greater in our hemisphere than in the other, according to God's plan for the good of man. At first glance, the account of the formation of the land given by Virgil in Inf. XXXIV differs considerably. There we read that S~atan fell from the southern part of the heavens, and that "la terra che pria di qua [i.e., the southern hemisphere] si sporse/Per paura di lui fe' del mar velo/E venne all'emisperio nostro . . ." (vv. 122-4). Were it not for the fall of Satan, in other words, the land in the southern hemisphere would have remained there, whereas the Quaestio would have us believe that there was a natural reason for the emergence of the land only in the northern hemisphere. Here, we are told, lies the "irriducibile contrasto" (p. 62). Professor Nardi insists that there was a "scientific" reason for the emergence of the land from the southern hemisphere, as the poem would have it. According to Aristotle, if the universe is a living animal, and if its "right" is by definition the place where motion begins (i.e., the East), then South must be "up," cor- responding to the head of the world's body, whereas North must correspond to its feet and West to its left. The southern hemisphere, like the head of a body, must be the place of greatest nobility, and because of this greater nobility, Professor Nardi infers, it was more fitting that the earth should arise there, and that the Satanic drama should be enacted in that region. The determining factors in choosing the southern hemisphere "sono state . . . le considerazioni che Aristotele e Averrob svolgono sulla maggior nobilth di essa in confronto a quella che noi abitiamo." For those to whom this may seem too dogmatic, Professor Nardi has a footnote which grants, somewhat grudgingly, that there might have been some other reasons for making the South "up": V'*. si, anche l'opposizione diametrale fra il monte dell'Eden e ii Calvario, e v'0 pure la diffusa leggenda che fa del legno della croce una derivazione dall'albero della vita; ma non iS dell'indole di Dante di accogliere una figurazione del mondo fisico che non abbia ii suo fondamento razionale nei principi cosmografici dell' aristotelismo. [p. 28, n.1] This footnote points up the unacceptability of Professor Nardi's argument. He would have us believe that the Aristotelian con- vention dictated Dante's cosmological scheme, and that by the merest coincidence, a few Christian legends fall nicely into place.</page><page sequence="4">102 ITALICA As a matter of fact, if Aristotle had never written, there would still be an overwhelming body of scriptural and theological tradi- tion suggesting the cosmic directions as they appear in the poem. The idea of hemispheric nobility is religious in origin and not Aristotelian, much less Averroistic; Dante's primary reason for suggesting it, as we shall see, is also religious. Nor must it be imagined that this is a minor issue, for the poet's reason for shaping his cosmos as he does, when he has a choice, necessarily implies something about the poem. It is above all a poem, and a religious one at that; if in so significant a detail as the locus of Satan's fall the theological and poetic considerations seem sec- ondary, then we are indeed faced with an extraordinary situation. Before we attempt a refutation of Professor Nardi's thesis on these grounds, however, it would be well to examine it in his own philosophic terms. First of all, it does not seem accurate to suggest that because of the Aristotelian idea of homispheric no- bility it was more fitting that the earth should have arisen in the southern lhemisphere. Secondly, Aristotelian convention has little, if anything, to do with the locus of Satan's fall. To begin with the first of these points, the word "nobility" is multivalent and must be carefully defined, as every reader of the Convivio knows. We may grant that the southern hemisphere is more '"noble;" it is however fallacious to assume that therefore the earth could not have been drawn up by the stars in the northern hemisphere. Professor Nardi has nowhere demonstrated the rele- vance of this Aristotelian nobility to the question of where the earth first arose. It would in fact seem that the relatively greater nobility of the southern hemisphere proves precisely the reverse of what Professor Nardi seems to think it proves. To believe that the South is more noble is to believe that the land was more likely to arise in the North, if it had to arise more on one side than on another, but in order to show this, we must begin by discussing the idea of hemispheric nobility in its origin. Anthropomorphic views of the earth and concomitant ideas about the relative nobility of the hemispheres are of course not original with Aristotle. There seems to be some evidence that the Egyptians, because of the great importance of the Nile and the fact that it flows North, considered the South as "up," the head of the world's body. Perhaps a remnant of this tradition, with an admixture of Greek elements, to be sure, survives in the Corpus</page><page sequence="5">SATAN'S FALL AND THE "QUAESTIO DE AQUA ET TERRA 103 Hermeticum. In one of the excerpts, Horus asks why the people who live beyond the boundaries of Egypt are less intelligent than the Egyptians themselves: "The earth," said Isis, "lies in the middle of the universe, stretched on her back, as a human being might lie, facing toward heaven. She is parted out into as many different members as man; and her head lies toward the South of the universe, her right shoulder toward the East and her left shoulder toward the West: her feet lie beneath the Great Bear, and her thighs are situated in the regions which follow next to the south of the Bear." [Stobaei Hermetica Exc. XXIV; trans. Scott, Hermetica, I, 5011 Prompted perhaps by a similar chauvinism, the Pythagoreans, in their table of opposites, attributed all good things to their own hemisphere, the northern this time, and asserted that we live "up" and "to the right" on the surface of the globe. At the same time, because of the religious importance of both the sun and the East, they affirmed that the diurnal motion of the heavens was "to the right," EPI DEXIA. Plato's Timaeus added its authority to this traditional belief, calling the motion from East to West and back to East again the "circle of the same," contrasting it with the movement of the planets and with the annual movement of the sun along the Zodiac, from West to East, which it called movement "to the left": EP'ARISTERA, "the circle of the other" (Ti- maeus 36 d). Aristotle, perhaps not altogether seriously, tries to reconcile the movement "to the right" of the heavens with the directions of his closed cosmos, and concludes that only if South is the head, looking heavenward, can it be said that the stars rise on the right, set on the left, and continue in the other hemisphere to return to the right: If this is true, that it begins from the right and returns to the right again, its upper pole must be the invisible one, since if it were the visible, the motion would be leftward, which we deny. Clearly there- fore the invisible pole is the upper, and those who live in the region of it are in the upper hemisphere and to the right, whereas we are in the lower and to the left. [De caele, 285b] For the philosopher, the discussion is mainly a refutation of Pythagorean ideas. From it, it follows that the stars, which actu- ally move to the right (the Platonic "circle of the same"), seem to move to the left in our hemisphere, whereas the planets, which move to the left, seem to move rightward. Only from the per- spective of the southern hemisphere are the movements actually as they are named.</page><page sequence="6">104 ITALICA For Aristotle, as for Plato, the movement of the stars repre- sented permanence and unity. This is the diurnal movement of the heavens, product of the intelligence "girando se sovra sua unitate" (Par. II, 13,8) as Dante expresses it, exemplar for the soul "che sh in sh rigira" (Pur.. XXV, 75). There must be another move- ment as well, however, to explain multiplicity and change-life as we know it. Aristotle explains that, in order to account for com- ing-to-be and passing away, there is also the leftward movement of the planets, the Platonic "circle of the other." This is the move- ment with respect to which we are "up": "Nevertheless in rela- tion to the secondary revolution, i.e., that of the planets, we are in the upper and right-hand part, and they are in the lower and left . . ." [285b]. Ours is the hemisphere of generation and cor- ruption, of the life-cycle itself, we may suggest, theirs is the hemisphere of permanence. Aristotle might not go so far; medieval thinkers certainly did. Before continuing, we must note that Professor Nardi has bril- liantly shown that only when medieval philosophers tried to recon- cile Aristotle with Genesis did the problem of the emersion of the land from the water pose itself: .1. il problema, inesistente per Aristotele e per Averrob . . . si pose ai filosofi, medici e cosmografi cristiani dalla fine del secolo XII in poi, per il conflitto che pareva loro definearsi fra la dottrina aristo- telica che pone l'acqua e gli altri elementi concentrici alla terra, e l'affermazione biblica che fu Dio stesso a raccogliere tutta l'acqua in un sol luogo "come in un otre," per fare emergere la "gran secca." [p. 434] When Albertus Magnus confronted the argument, he remembered the principle that we have been discussing-the northern hemi- sphere of generation and corruption, the southern is the hemisphere of permanence-taking it far more seriously than Aristotle ever did, and suggesting this as a reason why the other is the hemisphere of water: constat enim quod super inferius hemisphaerium stellae secundum diversum motum ab occidente oriuntur: vadunt igitur super illos nocte a sinistro coeli, sicut patet ex his quae in secundo libro Goeli et Mundi determinata sunt. Signa autem secundum quae moventur planetae, in eis supra ordinem naturalem disponuntur: quia in eis est Piscis post Arietem, et post Piscem Aquarius, et post Aquarium Capricornus, et sic de aliis [i.e., the reverse of ours]: et cum naturalis motus planetarum sit secundum ordinem signorum ab Occidente in Oriens, videbitur non esse ordinatus motus coeli ad esse et genera- tionem super illos. Propter quod dixit Pythagoras inferius hemis-</page><page sequence="7">SATAN'S FALL AND THE, "QUAESTIO DE AQUA ET TERRA 105 phaerium esse locum poenarum et tartari, vocans dispostionem orbis super inferius hemisphaerium orbem sub quem deprimunt hominem peccata sua: et gemere eos qui ibi sunt aquis infinitus. [Lib. de Natura locorum; I, xii; Opera IX, 553] It is precisely because the southern hemisphere is not governed primarily by the cosmic movement of generation and corruption that Albertus supposed it to be without land. Moreover he sur- mises that it is also for this reason that the Pythagoreans made it eternity's locus, the hemisphere of Tartarus. Nobility and daily life, with its cyclical change, are in this respect incompatible. Dante was no Pythagorean, but he too wrote of a place in the southern hemisphere where sin is expiated, and where mortals could travel only with divine dispensation. Statius tells us which move- ment of the heavens ruled Purgatory itself: "Cosa non o che sanza Ordine senta la religione De la montagna, o che sia fuor d'usanza. Libero 6 qui da ogni alterazione. Di quel che il ciel da se in sa riceve Esser ci puote, e non d'altro cagione" (Purg. XXI, 40,45). The only movement of which it can be said that "se in s' riceve" is the first, or outermost; all the others "di su prendono e di sotto fanno" (Par. II, 123), a principle that Dante learned from the Liber de causis. This is the movement of the "circle of the same" in a Platonic context, or of the Aristotelian first movement, or of Dante's primum mobile, the "se in sb" recalling both "girando se sovra sua unitate" and "se in se rigira". In the light of Albertus' suggestion that in the southern hemisphere "non [est] ordinatus motus coeli ad esse et generationem,y" it would seem that Dante is suggesting that here permanence, the "movement to the right," rules. Rather than say with Professor Nardi that Dante adopted an arbitrary Aristotelian convention about an ill-defined nobility, it seems more correct to suggest that South is "up" in the poem in order to guarantee the sovereignty of the "circle of the same" over the whole hemisphere, making generation and corrup- tion, mortal life, secondary in that world (and non-existent on the Mount of Purgatory) where eternity rules. Therein lies its no- bility; changes such as the author of the Quaestio suggested are less likely to occur there. Neither Albertus nor Dante nor the author of the Quaestio, if it was not Dante, would have been sur-</page><page sequence="8">106 ITALICA prised by the simultaneous affirmation of two theses that Professor Nardi thinks incompatible: that the south is the more noble hemi- sphere, and that change was more likely in the North. Science had to wait for Galileo before it could appreciate the fact that varia- tion and change have a nobility of their own. There was another reason for thinking it proper that the land should first arise in the North, and this is the reason used by the author of the Quaestio. Given (by the Bible) that there is an im- balance in the distribution of land over the earth's surface, there must be some imbalance in the heavens to account for this, since "the aspects of things below are like to the aspects of things above." The only obvious imbalance in the heavens, as far as one could tell, occurred in the starry heaven, for there seemed to be, and there in fact are, fewer stars in its southern hemisphere than there are in its northern. One might suppose that this would make for a greater nobility in the northern hemisphere, thus contradicting the Aristo- telian contention. Albertus Magnus claimed that "haec ratio movet Pythagoras ad hoc quod dixit partem Septentrionalem primi orbis esse sursum ...", and Ristoro d'Arezzo (ed. Narducci, p. 11) thought that the fact that there are more stars in the North makes it "up" and "to the right," and therefore more noble. But Pythagoras was wrong, for Aristotle had proven him wrong, and Ristoro is scarcely significant in this respect, for he never felt any particular obligation to follow Aristotle. Albertus, on the other hand, was committed to believing both that there were fewer stars in the South and that it was the hemisphere of greater nobility. He begins by granting that South is up and north down: Et sunt in ea [imaginatio] plures dubitatlones. Cum enim ad oculum videamus esse plures stellas in parte orbis Septentrionali, et plares imagines stellarum, videtur quod majoris vigoris est pars Septentrio- nalis quam Meridiana pars: et sic videtur dignius esse, quod pars Septentrionalis sit sursum quam pars Meridiana coeli. . . . Nos enim scimus quod pars coeli magis habens virtutes est ubi est stella: et ideo conveniens esse videtur, quod ubi plures sunt stellae, plus sit ibi coelestis virtutis . .. [sed] . . . dicendum videtur secundum Astro- nomos, quod . . . fons caloris est a Meridie et stellis Meridianis: et ideo est sursum coeli sicut de eo quod est sursum animalis diximus: et ad hoc quod objicitur, quod plures sunt stellae et plures sunt imagines in Septentrione, videtur esse dicendum, quod sunt septem stellae quae habent se ad alias sicut anima ad corpus, sicunt tradunt Mathematici, eo quod agunt in ipsas virtutes suas sicut anima in corpus: hae autem septem maxime sequuntur solem. . . . Solis autem vicinior viae terrae est in Meridie . . . et ideo ut opinior, pars Meri-</page><page sequence="9">SATAN'S FALL AND THE "QUAESTIO DE AQUA ET TERRA 107 diana dicitur superior, et pars Aquilonaris dicitur inferior.... Dicitur autem aliquando aliter supremum et infimum coeli secundum cursum stellarum: et sicut medium coeli in Meridie vocatur supremum, et medium in hemisphaerio inferiori quod est locus stellae in media nocte, vocatur infimum: et hoc modo mathematici vocant supremum et infimum coeli. [Lib. II, tr. I, 14; Opera IV, 137 f] The point is that Albertus managed perfectly well, by shifting the criterion of nobility, to square the Aristotelian belief with the fact that the North has more stars. We may note in passing that Aver- roes, to whom Professor Nardi gives much of the credit for the genesis of the idea of nobility, is cited by Albertus as not taking Aristotle seriously in this regard: "Dixit autem ad hoc Averroes quod distinctio superioris in caelo et inferioris non est vera nisi secundum opinionem Pythagorae .. ." (Ibid), which scepticism is in part reflected in Thomas' commentary on De caelo 285b when he concluded that "Aristoteles ... loquitur more Pythagoricum." At any rate, it is clear from this passage by Albertus that a phi- losopher could hold both to the belief that the South is more noble and to the thesis of the Quaestio that the greater number of stars is to be found in the northern hemisphere. Professor Nardi seems to suggest that Dante could not have be- lieved that the stars in the northern hemisphere are stronger than the stars in the South, as they are in the view of the author of the Quaestio: Infine, l'autore della Quaestio attribuisce alle costellazioni dell'emisfero boreale solo questo potere di fare emergere la terra; nella Divina Commedia invece le stelle hanno un potere ben maggiore: quello di trarre all'esistenza i quattro elementi, per la "virtui informante," con- cessa da Dio alle "stelle che 'ntorno a lor vanno," tanto nell' emisfero boreale che in quello australe. Di questa dottrina, che e tipica di Dante, nessuna traccia nella Quaestio che al poeta e stata malamente attribuita. [65-6] But this is either sophistry or an almost unbelievable blunder: the word "stelle" is a generic term for all of the heavenly bodies, planets and stars alike. Isidore and Bede, for instance, constantly distinguished two kinds of stellae: planetae, id est errantes, ... caeterae, quae aplanes appellantur . . ." (Isidore, PL 83, 994; cf. Bede, PL 90, 206), and the same is certainly true of Dante. In the passage quoted above, Professor Nardi misleads us into thinking that he is comparing the doctrines of the Quaestio and of the Divina Commedia concerning the power of the stars (although he does not in fact say this), whereas he is actually juxtaposing what</page><page sequence="10">108 ITALICA the former says of the fixed stars, or constellations, with what the latter says of the stars in general, including the planets, for with respect to "li elementi," the planets are surely the first "stelle che 'ntorno a lor vanno." Now it happens that the author of the Quaestio turns to the fixed stars in his search for an efficient cause through the process of elimination, not because he believes the planets to be powerless, but because he knows that the planets move over both hemispheres equally, and thus do their work "tanto nel- 1'emisfero boreale che in quello australe." They cannot therefore account for the imbalance. The starry heaven, on the other hand, pours down its diverse virtues through diverse organs (Quaestio XXI; cf. Par. II, 115 ff., esp. 121 and 139; Moore, p. 341); it alone can account for the uneven effect. There is nothing in the argument of Quaestio XXI, which abounds in Dantesque expres- sions, that need contradict anything that the poem says, or any- thing that Aristotle maintained about the nobility of the South- ern hemisphere. The poem nevertheless maintains that at least some of the land was in the southern hemisphere; that part of it recoiled from Satan when he fell: "la terra che pria di qua si sporse .. ." Professor Nardi reads into this line the suggestion that the land first emerged from the water in the southern hemisphere: E poichi la parte pifi nobile dell'universo 4, secondo lo Stagirita, I'emisfero antartico, in questo appunto, per Dante, era emersa dap- prima Ia terra, che avrebbe dovuto essere abitata dall'uomo, per la "virtit informante" delle stelle. [p. 14] We have shown that on the contrary, it was more fitting that the more noble part should have remained lifeless and covered with water. The line simply tells us that what land there was in the mixed elements of the southern hemisphere (whether a small frac- tion or a great deal, but certainly not all) came to ours soon after time began: by the very principles of hemispheric nobility which Professor Nardi claims Dante to have espoused, it becomes impos- sible to believe that the poet could have imagined the cycle of generation and corruption taking place in the South. To all of this speculation, however, it may be objected that it is not relevant to the comparison with the treatise. Nothing that happened before Satan's fall is properly speaking the province</page><page sequence="11">SATAN'S FALL AND THE "QUAESTIO DE AQUA ET TERRA 109 of natural investigation. Professor Nardi's attempt at the wedding of science and poetic theology seems particularly forced when it is directed toward those moments between the creation of the elements on one hand and the fall of Satan on the other. In the first mo- ment, he tells us, God created the angels, the heavens, and pure matter; in the second the good angels were exalted and began mov- ing the spheres so that they might cooperate in the work of creation: ... gli angeli ribelli invece non furon cosi rapidi, e Lucifero dovette perder del tempo per adescare i restii a seguirlo, come pensano alcuni teologi, specialmente i pusillanimi che avrebber voluto restar neutrali e, posti fra Dio e il diavolo, non seppero decidersi ne per l'uno ne per altro, ma "per se foro." Cosi nell'assai lunga mora fra la loro crea- zione e la loro caduta dal cielo, "ne giugneriesi numerando al venti," le intelligenze motrici, quando i ribelli precipitarono dal cielo nel- 1'emisfero antartico, avevan gih "fabbricato" i quattro elementi e tratto la terra fuori dell'acqua, come sappiamo. [p. 24-5] He is forced to this hypothesis in his attempt to interpret Virgil's words to mean that the land was already separated from the water and was entirely in the South when Satan fell, and then to square this with the belief that the circling of the good angels was respon- sible for the formation of the elements. But his own words may be turned against him-"non e dell'indole di Dante" . . . , for the legends about vacillating angels are incompatible with moral in- tellectualism: given that the choice was present to all of the angels, and that they had the ability to choose, nothing could delay that choice. The Scotists could believe in a kind of moral indifferentism, but Dante was a radical intellectualist, as Nardi himself has dem- onstrated ("I1 libero arbitrio e l'asino di Buridano," Nel Mondo di Dante, pp. 287-303), and the idea of some of the angels marking time, trying to decide what to do when they had all the facts at their disposal, is as foreign to Dante's intellectualist mentality as can be imagined (cf. Freccero, "Dante and the Neutral Angels," Romanic Review LI, 1, pp. 3-14). If we insist upon accounting for the delay between the beginning of the good angels' gyrations (and hence of time), and the fall of Satan to earth, we have a far more acceptable tradition at hand, which is purely poetic. Hesiod claimed that it took the Giants nine days to fall to earth, and some Christian writers, adapting this to the Christian pattern and a nine-sphere cosmology, suggested that it took the angels this long to fall from heaven and reach earth (Hesiod, Theogony, 722; Piers the Ploughman, b.I.119, ISkeat's note</page><page sequence="12">110 ITALICA ad loc.). But this is completely outside of Dante's poem, as is Pro- fessor Nardi's speculation in the first place. For this reason it need not detain us. We have strayed very far indeed from nature, but it is to nature that the author of the Quaestio confines himself: . . . the present treatise does not go beyond the scope of nature, for it is confined to mobile existence, to wit water and earth, which are natural bodies; and therefore we are to look for such certainty as is consonant with natural order, which is here our subject-matter . . . [XX, 10] Nature does not begin until the good angels begin to turn the spheres, after their moment of choice. Of Dante's poetical account of the formation of the hemisphere of land, all we know is that 1) there was a mass of land and water, presumably mixed, in the North as well as the South, which was our world; 2) Satan fell; 3) the land was separated from the water, the former going to the northern hemisphere, the latter to the southern. When a scientist, as opposed to a poet or theologian, approaches this subject, he must perforce begin, not with 1), but rather with 3) : the land was sepa- rated from the water. Furthermore, lie must choose a natural ex- planation: Albertus Magnus knew Genesis I, 9-10 as well as any- one else, and yet when it came to explaining why, he made no appeal to God, but rather to the stars, and their ability to "dry" the water away from the land. So it may have been with Dante, if he is indeed the author of the Quaestio: as a poet-theologian he suggests the existence of an undefined mass of water and land which is separated by Satan's fall. As a natural scientist, he maintains the mass is separated by the attraction of the stars. Nor are these contradictory: the scientist describes the phenomenon in terms of attraction, the poet-theologian in terms of repulsion, while the phenomenon remains the same. If we wished to press a com- monplace analogy (Quaestio XXI; Albertus, De natura locorum, I, v; Opera IX, 537) between the power of the stars and that of a magnet, we might say that just as the magnet attracts at one pole and repels at another, so the scientist of the Quaestio sees the emergence of the land as the attraction exerted by the northern stars, while Dante the theologian sees it as the repulsion of the fallen angel. It makes no more sense to ask of the scientist what role the devil plays in this attraction, than it does to ask of the poet theologian how earth can experience the emotion of fear.</page><page sequence="13">SATAN'S FALL AND THE "QUAESTIO DE AQUA ET TERRA 111 The polarity, suggested by our analogy, between northern stars and a fallen southern angel is not mere rhetoric, for it points the way toward a possible reconciliation of the scientific Quaestio with the theologico-poetic Commedia, to be achieved by theologizing the former. This is pure speculation, and ordinarily inadmissible in a serious discussion of this sort, but it is called for by Professor Nardi's equal and opposite sin: deducing science from poetic statement. In order to suggest a way of reconciling the two it will first be necessary to complete the rebuttal of Professor Nardi's philo- sophical argument. We have already shown it to be incorrect to say that because of the southern hemisphere's greater nobility it was more fitting that the earth should have arisen there. It re- mains now to demonstrate that the Aristotelian convention has little, if anything, to do with determining the region from which Satan fell. In our discussion of hemispheric nobility we noted that histor- ically speaking the polarity was always seen in terms of a duality: for the Pythagoreans, North=good, South=bad; for the Egyp- tians, North=inferiority, South=superiority; for Aristotle, or at least for Aristotle in the medieval reading, North=change, South= permanence. It happens that exegetes saw such a duality in the Bible too, and most often equated the South (heat, light, the Soin) with Good, while the North (coldness, darkness) came to symbolize Evil. A verse most often cited is Jeremiah I, 14: "Ab aquilone pandetur omne malum super omnes habitatores terrae," which is an excellent gloss for Satan himself: "Ben dee da lui proceder ogni lutto" (Inf. XXXIV, 36) ; an evil wind proceeds from him, freezing Hell itself, just as "Frigidus ventus aquilo flavit, et gelavit crystallus ab aqua" (Ecclesiasticus XLIII, 22). It was quite nat- ural, then, to associate Satan with the North. Moreover Lucifer in the Book of Isaiah, universally understood by medieval exegetes to be the devil, says of himself," Sedebo . . . in lateribus aquilonis " (Isaiah XIV, 13), and thereby clinches the matter. Many of the most influential commentators, from Rabanus Maurus (PL 111, 8U6-7) to Albertus associate Lucifer with the North. St. Bonaven- ture goes further, and affirms precisely that hell is in the North, symbolically speaking, while heaven is south. Commenting upon Ecclesiastes XI, 3 he says:</page><page sequence="14">112 ITALICA Si ceciderit lignum ad austrum: lignum istud, homo . . . Et auster dat intelligere calorem caritatis et statum gloriae; Cantici quarto: "'Surge, aquilo, et veni, auster; perfla hortum meum" etc. Lignum igitur cadere ad austrum est hominem in morte introduci in gloriam. ... Si ceciderit ad aquilonem, ibi erit, id est, si ad poenam infernalem; leremiae primoe: "Ab aquilone pandetur omne malum"; qui cadit in infernum ibi erit, quia inde nunquam liberabitur. [Quaracchi, VI, 881 Nor must it be imagined that this was without its impact in lit- erature. My good friend Professor R. E. Kaske has pointed out to me a note by W. W. Skeat in his edition of Piers the Plowman (1886), which contains citations from Chaucer, Langland, Milton, Clout and many others illustrating the point (II, 25). Even in the Icelandic Glyfaginning, he tells us (p. 26), "downwards and northwards lietlh the way to hell." Of particular interest, how- ever, is a passage in The Myroure of Oure Ladye (ed. Blunt [18731, p. 189): Fyrste ye shall understande that the northe wynde ys colde and bytyng, and maketh fayre flowres som tyme to fade. And therefore by the northe ys understonded the fende Lucyfer. that by coldenesse of hys malyse caused other aungels that are lykened to fayre flowres. to fall from blysse. The holy goste also ys understonde by the sowthe. for lyke as the sowthe . . . by the wynde of hys charyte. and holy inspyracion. [he] maketh the rayne of grace to falle upon bareyne sowlles. Here a polarity, or duality, is established between Satan and the Holy Ghost, between the north wind and the south wind, the former suggesting the ice of malice, the latter the heat of charity. This is not philosophically or theologically justified, of course, for duality suggests dualism, and there is no question here of opposite and equal. Poetically speaking, however, no one would deny its apt- ness; so much is this the case that Dante himself used a kind of northern wind-" Quindi Cocito tutto s'aggelava" (Inf. XXXIV, 52)-in this hideous parody of the Divine PNEUMA, or Holy Breath. We may go so far as to say that for Dante too, as for Bonaventure, to fall to the North is to fall ad poenam infernalem, to fall to the South is to be introduced in gloriam. Satan, who would sit on the side of the North, has his wish, as princeps huius mundi. The poem is staged, then, between two poles: Satan and God, the former being the center of the physical world and beyond the outermost circumference of the spiritual world, whereas God is at the center of the spiritual world and is the circumference of the</page><page sequence="15">SATAN'S FALL AND THE "QUAESTIO DE AQUA ET TERRA 113 physical, as the poet learns when he crosses the crystalline sphere. In all of this, there is precious little Aristotle. Dante would say that the philosopher, in this matter of hemispheric nobility, bears out the scriptural tradition in an obscure way, whereas the histor- ian may observe that Aristotle's argument in the De caelo is simply a reflection of the human tendency to see symbolically in the dichot- omy between north and south the dual poles of a system of values. To continue our perhaps fanciful speculation about possible ways of reconciling the poetic theology of the poem with the science of the tract, we have said that the poem views the emergence of the land as the repulsion exercised by the falling angel, almost as if the land joined Psalm 90 in its wish to be safe "A ... de- monio meridiano" (v. 6), whereas the treatise attributes the emergence to the attraction of the northern stars. It might well be that angels and stars are here equivalent, by an association as old as the Timaeus (cf. Gregory, Moralia XXVIII, 14; PL 76, 468), and that it was the fall of Satan and his followers from status gloriae, the South, that caused the imbalance in the distri- bution of the stars. We need only recall the verse of the Apocalypse, universally read as describing Satan's fall, telling us that when draco, the devil, fell to earth, "cauda eius trahebat tertiam partem stellarum caeli, et misit eas in terramin . ." (Apoc. 12, 4). When the demons (who are stars) fell to earth, did they not leave a greater number of stars (who are angels) on the other side ? If the land moved as a result of this, was the efficient cause the repul- sion of stars/angels or the attraction of angels/stars? When a magnet turns a piece of metal, does it do so by repulsion from one pole or attraction from the other ? The suggestion as to a possible reconciliation strikes us as im- possibly ingenious, and our rhetorical questions are unanswerable, precisely because it occurs to no one, except to Professor Nardi, to compare poetic theology with a scientific treatise on equal terms. Once we have established that there is no necessary and complete contradiction between the two, it is difficult to see how, and in what direction, one could go any further. It should be remembered that none of the foregoing was written to prove that Dante was the author of the Qwcaestio, but merely to suggest that Professor Nardi has not given us any reason to suppose</page><page sequence="16">114 ITALICA that he was not. The philological and empirical demonstrations offered by the great Dantists of the past will not fall so easily, and they surely deserve to be discussed by anyone who calls their results into question. This Professor Nardi does not do, and his book suffers for it. More important than this is our quarrel with Professor Nardi's methodology; there are more things in Dante's heaven and hell than were dreamt of by Aristotle or Averroes. That Dante believed there was no basic contradiction between philosophy and theology only a fool would deny; nevertheless, his philosophy is profoundly transformed, or perhaps informed, by the articulation of his poem. The laws of physics as the world knows them appear to be the same in the poet's universe, but they are conditioned, not by the law of gravity, but rather by the law of love. Earth may be the heaviest of the elements as far as Aristotle was concerned, but there was also a spiritual materiality, more Platonic in origin, about which he seems to have known nothing. For Christians, Augustine was the great physicist of love, and his doctrine was summed up in a simple phrase; "pondus meum amor meus.": Weight makes not downward only, but to his own place also. The fire mounts upward, a stone sinks downward. All things pressed by their own weight go towards their proper places. Oil poured in the bottom of the water is raised above it: water poured upon oil, sinks to the bottom of the oil. They are driven by their own weights, to seek their own places. Things a little out of their places become un- quiet; put them in their order again and they are quieted. My weight is my love: by that am I carried, whithersoever I be carried . [Conf. XIII, ix, trans. Watts (Loeb), II, 391] For this reason there can be no other point "al quale ogni gravezza si rauna" (Inf. XXXII, 74) than Satan himself. This creature, the eternal negation in the polarity caritas-cupiditas, caused a displacement in the cosmos when he fell from which the world has not yet recovered: "Ben dee da lui proceder ogni lutto." Physicists, or even Christians when they talk only physics, can know nothing about this kind of gravity. Only in a world governed by another kind of physics, the physics of love-pondus amoris- does it make any sense to say that the earth rushed away, in both directions, from a spiritual creature. A neo-platonist, an Origen, could believe in the gradual incarnation of a star-soul as it falls through the successive planetary spheres until, heavy-laden with the dross material that is the flesh, it reaches its point of exile,</page><page sequence="17">SATAN'S FALL AND THE "QUAESTIO DE AQUA ET TERRA 115 the earth. A Christian, however, could accept no doctrine equating the flesh with evil. A Christian poet, on the other hand, is free, just as Augustine was free, to symbolize that evil with a poetic materiality such as Satan actually possesses in the poem. The gravity of Satan's sin, in a cosmos which is entirely governed by love, where love determines all classifications, becomes incarnate in the poem with a material so heavy that all of creation must stand aside and make room for it. Small wonder if there should be a discrepancy between this system and that of the treatise. To say that the arguments of Aristotle and Averroes were re- sponsible for Dante's cosmography is to confuse sources with structure: it is certainly relevant to speak of Aristotle with regard to the former; with the latter he has very little to do. The poem is an itinerary, and if on such a journey the way down is the way up, it is not because Aristotle (or countless others) said that the South was "up." Rather is it because in the mystical journey of the mind to God, the ascent to truth must be preceded by a descent in humility within the self: Augustine's exhortation, " Descend... so that you may ascend," is echoed by St. Bonaventure when he tells us that the way supra nos is intra nos, and Dante's descent into hell is the dramatization of precisely such a journey. We need only remember that from the very bottom of the pit, the pilgrim's upward journey into a new world begins as all such journeys be- gin,-with a turning upside-down, a "conversion"; if we would know more about the antecedents of that crucial turning-point, of the poem's center of gravity, of the burella that it created, we would do better to turn to Plato's myth of the cave than to Aris- totle's De caelo. To put the matter another way, if the Quaestio Iooks up at the stars, it does so only with the eye of the body, while the poem turns to gaze even at the center of the universe with the eye o6 the soul. It will not do to confuse the perspectives. In the last analysis, it is perhaps a tribute to the genius of Dante (and of his age) that a complementary detail such as the Aristotelian physics should be so little distorted by the pattern of the poem that a Dantist of Professor Nardi's eminence could mistake it for the guiding principle.
