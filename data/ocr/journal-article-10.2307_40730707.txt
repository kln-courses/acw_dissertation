<plain_text><page sequence="1">International Studies Review (2010) 12, 8-30 A Socio-Political and -Cultural Model of the War in Afghanistan1 Armando Geller George Mason University AND Shah Jamal Alam University of Michigan We present a simulation model of current conflict-torn Afghanistan in which a system-dynamics model is coupled with an agent-based model. Agent-based modeling techniques are applied to model indi- vidual cognition and behavior as well as group formation processes. System-dynamics modeling is used for representing macro conflict processes, such as duration of violence and combat success ratio. The cognitive and behavioral processes are couched in a socio-cultural context and feed into the system dynamics processes. This affords us exploring the relationship between local socio-culturally-driven cogni- tion and behavior and (dynamic) macro properties of armed conflict. We demonstrate the importance of analyzing conflict-torn Afghanistan from an interplay of adapting "traditional" socio-cultural mecha- nisms, political culture and power structures, and politico-economic macro-processes. We find that variations in the conflict's superstruc- ture can be explained through variations in socio-culturally depen- dent structures. The model indicates limitations with regard to classical prediction, but is promising with regard to explanatory-driven pattern forecasting. In Afghanistan, "traditional" modes of warfare merge with contemporaneous modes of guerrilla warfare (Roy 1994)1. This does not only apply to warfare in a narrow, tactical sense, but also in a wider dimension encompassing the conflict- torn Afghan society. We argue that the socio-cultural dimension is important in creating an understanding of conflict in general and, more specifically, current Afghanistan. The aim of the research at hand is to investigate the role of socio- cultural factors in the production of conflict. For this reason we investigate the following two general questions: What are the inter-relations between socio-cultural and -political patterns and macro-properties and -outcomes of armed conflict? Can we infer from knowledge about cultural traits to patterns of future conflict outcomes? !This article significantly extends work conducted by Geller and Moss (2008).

We understand as political culture a repertoire of cognitive, behav- ioral, and normative patterns in the production of power as well as in the organi- zation of groups for the pursuit of cooperation and conflict. Whereas the sphere of the cultural has for long been of interest to both, anthropologists and politi- cal scientists that are interested in conflict (for example, Ferguson 1990; Snyder 2002), formal models of conflict taking into account the socio-cultural sphere are to the best of our knowledge non-existent. However, explanations for who interacts with whom, how, when, and why can be (partially) explained in terms of (political) culture through the idea of indi- vidual action selection. Issues of (political) culture also stand at the core of group and alliance formation as well as group interaction processes (for exam- ple, Hannan and Freeman 1977; Morrill 2008). Besides theoretical reasons to include cultural factors as explanatory variables for micro and macro social phenomena, there are imminent empirical reasons. Afghan daily culture remains to be "traditional." "Traditional" perceptions of norms and values, family relations, social cohesiveness, and the like continue to be of great importance (Azoy 2003; Dupree 2004). Warfare in Afghanistan - now and in the past - reflects the socio-cultural organizational characteristics of the Afghan society (cf. Dupree 1984). Models not taking into account culture there- fore turn a blind eye on an important explanatory factor. Socio-cultural differences can account for why conflicts take particular forms. Lubkemann (2005), for example, describes how local socio-cultural and -political idiosyncrasies lead to varying local materializations of the same conflict. A cul- ture-oriented view of conflict also implies an endogenous approach to the analy- sis of conflict. Armed conflicts in general, but non-interstate conflicts in particular do not erupt; rather they are path-dependent and evolve from existing structures. An endogenous analytical perspective of the emergence of conflict lays bare relevant organizational processes and structures on both, the micro- and macro-levels that are pivotal to the understanding of conflict. These processes and structures include issues such as recruitment, group formation, radicalization, etc. Finally, knowledge about how and why particular forms of conflict evolve puts us in a position to sketch out conflict development patterns that will allow for inferential conclusions of what to expect in the near future based on what we see today. This is, identifying and understanding relevant socio-cultural dimensions does not only support early warning efforts for conflict outbreak, but will also afford anticipation of alliance formation scenarios. The modeling framework we developed to study socio-political culture in con- junction with armed conflict consists of a macro-level system dynamics model of guerrilla warfare in Afghanistan which is couched into an agent-based computa- tional model of socio-cultural organization processes of power structures in Afghanistan. System dynamics models have been utilized in modeling guerrilla war- fare's macro properties (for example, Allan and Stahel 1983; Blank et al. 2008); agent-based models have been utilized in cultural modeling exercises (cf. Axelrod 1997; Geller and Moss 2008). Agent-based models afford explicating agent cogni- tion and behavior also by means of qualitative data. This feature is in congruence with recent research that expands on more traditional modeling schools by empha- sizing the importance of incorporating qualitative data progressively and in a problem-driven manner into statistical analysis (cf. Kalyvas 2003; Sambanis 2004), and by formalizing mathematical models also on the basis of qualitative data (cf. Weinstein 2005). Our approach combines the rigor of formal modeling with the expressiveness and availability of qualitative data. Its context-sensitivity affords the elaboration of explanations in the tradition of generative social science (Cederman 2005;</page><page sequence="3">10 Modeling the Afghan Conflict Epstein 2006). This includes the study of social mechanisms, a type of individual agent interactions that regularly lead to the emergence of similar aggregate level patterns (Hedström and Swedberg 1998). The Case: Afghanistan Although the three-decade-long conflict in Afghanistan is a multifaceted phe- nomenon, there nevertheless exist a number of recurring issues in the literature without which a description of the case and, subsequently, a model would be incomplete. In what follows, we concentrate on these necessary factors without claiming exhaustiveness. Roughly, they can be divided into endogenous and gen- eric factors. We refer to generic factors as an exogenous or a generally "accepted" characteristic of armed conflict (Table 1). Endogenous factors, by contrast, are circumstantial to the war in Afghanistan. Generic Factors Roy (1995), among many others, identifies ethnic and religious radicalization as two central developments in the Afghan conflict that have their origins in the Jihad against the Soviets (1979-1989). Actual manifestations of these two types of radicalization are of a localized nature, meaning that there exist geographical and communal differences, but their general importance for the understanding of the Afghan conflict cannot be estimated high enough. The support of differ- ent, often discordant guerrilla groups by foreign states reinforced ethnic and religious (and political) fragmentation (Rubin 2002; Shahrani 2002). The development of a highly internationalized rentier and criminalized econ- omy is a further generic factor. Conflict-related migration of several million peo- ple has torn communities apart and has inflicted a heavy burden on Afghanistan's neighbors, especially Iran and Pakistan, but gave also rise to com- mercial, labor, and information networks, which considerably influence Afghan social life (Monsutti 2005; Harpviken 2009). Military support for the Mujahedin and humanitarian aid for the civil population not only increased Afghanistan's foreign dependence, but also strengthened the rentier economy and gave rise to a criminalized state (Rubin 1992; Goodhand 2004). Nowadays, the criminaliza- tion of Afghanistan is a permanent institutionalized condition that foils recon- struction efforts (Giustozzi 2007; Rubin 2007). Table 1 .

Alternative governance structures in the form of autonomous fiefdoms exist throughout and beyond Afghanistan (Glatzer 2002; Giustozzi 2007). They are ruled by local strongmen (or "war- lords"). Many of them constitute a local security architecture in which micro- economies evolve (Giustozzi 2007). The latter are often driven by organized crime, such as drugs or smuggling, and international aid, fueling the struggle over scarce resources (Goodhand 2004). The Afghan drug economy has devastat- ing effects: its revenues flow into the pockets of strongmen and government offi- cials, are used to arm the Taliban and other local militias, and form an important source for corruption (Goodhand 2005). While the NATO-led Inter- national Security Assistance Force (ISAF) constitutes a last resort of state control, its local allies from the Afghan National Police (ANP) and Army (ANA) are part of Afghanistan's institutionalized criminalization (Rubin 2007). Endogenous Factors Social change caused by conflict has been considerable. Parts of Afghan society, especially among the elites, have become anomic (Geller 2009). A contrasting, but not excluding view is that Afghan society has remained culturally and organiza- tionally traditional (Canfield 1988:186; Roy 1995:21-25; Dupree 2004:177). qawm (see below), political parties (Giustozzi 2000), territorial groupings and Islamic sects (Canfield 1988:186-187), among others, constitute important endogenous organizational structures. We concentrate our study on the notion of qawm. qawm is an Arabic expression used in Afghanistan to describe fluid solidarity groups, qawm are intimately related with Afghanistan's political culture and through them behavior and reasoning with regard to power can be analyzed (cf. Azoy 2003). The meaning of qawm varies considerably and can denote a(n) (extended) family, tribe, descent group, ethnicity, "people like us" (Tapper 2008:101), an "occupational group" (Roy 1992:75), and "persons who mutually assist each other" (Canfield 1973:35). Basically, qawm connote complex interper- sonal networks of political, social, economic, military, and cultural relations (Roy 1995:21-25; Mousavi 1997:46-48; Tapper 2008). These meanings are not mutu- ally exclusive and qawm therefore do not exhibit defined boundaries or consti- tute mutually exclusive groups. "[A] n individual always belongs to more than one [qawm]" (Canfield 1988:194). Identities, hence, are negotiable and actions depending on these identities are opportunity-based (Glatzer 2001). Some of the categories on the basis of which an agent can decide to which group he (temporarily) belongs have already been mentioned. These are kin- ship, tribe, ethnicity, and religion. Based on Azoy's study (2003), they can be subsumed under the term hisiyat (for the following see also Janata and Hassas 1975). The attributes ascribed to an agent under the notion hisiyat describe an agent's "character." hisiyat also informs about whether an agent is trustworthy and loyal. Religion, tribe, kinship, etc. are relatively "statically" ascribed attri- butes. Trustworthiness, loyalty and the like are ascribed dynamically, since they can change over time. The other type of agent attributes mentioned by Azoy (2003) can be subsumed under the notion e'tibar, which translates into "credit." e'tibar is a meritocratic and dynamic concept, describing whether an agent is reli- able, successful, etc. A complete list of these and additional fundamental dimen- sions in which an Afghan individual potentially reasons can be found in Geller and Moss (2008:327). Generally spoken, these cultural dimensions mirror an individual's module-like cognition (cf. Sperber and Hirschfeld 2004). They also influence an individual's choices. qawm is not only an objectifying, but also an inherently social concept. It implies a variety of relational concepts such as solidarity and rivalry, qawm face competition from other qawm and internal competition among members of a</page><page sequence="5">12 Modeling the Afghan Conflict qawm (Roy 1994:74, 1995:21-22; Azoy 2003). They need to be sustained, and an Afghan leader's ability to accumulate and redistribute resources through various channels makes him powerful and, eventually, successful (Roy 1994Í74). The abil- ity to create a qawm for a particular aim is perceived as a demonstration of power (Azoy 2003:36). qawm continue to "have a powerful and pervasive effect on con- temporary political discourse and the behavior of Afghans" (Shahrani 2002:220). During the years of conflict they have also often been misused by new elites for the pursuit of conflict and criminal aims (Rubin 1992; Roy 1994; Shahrani 2002). Manifestations of such abusive behavior are for example corruption, drug production and smuggling, nepotism, massive organized violence crime, etc. (Glatzer 2002; Giustozzi 2007; Rubin 2007). Guerrilla War in Afghanistan Guerrilla wars - or insurgencies, as they are called more often nowadays - are regularly modeled as system dynamics models. Blank et al. (2008) provide a recent account of such a model of the war in Iraq; Allan and Stahel (1983) developed a model of the Afghan-Soviet War (1979-1989). The value of these type of models lies in their ability to identify and connect key, and thus neces- sary, features of a dynamic system in a (sometimes overly) simple way. Many practitioners of guerrilla wars, such as Mao Tse-tung (1961), Vo Nguyen Giap (1970), and Ernesto Che Guevara (2006), identified intangible key features while theorizing guerrilla war, two of which are recurring. The first one is the importance of the civilian population's support in sustaining a successful guer- rilla war. There exist three reasons for the population's importance: recruitment, information, and human camouflage. Unsurprisingly, counter-insurgency forces identified for themselves the civilian population as being crucial for their success in defeating guerrilla forces (or insurgents) . Second, a steady inflow of material resources is essential for a sustainable guerrilla campaign. This inflow often stems from an illicit economy and/or a private or state sponsor. In all of Afghanistan's different war phases in the last three decades (Jihad; civil war; Taliban [1994-2001]) these intangibles played - cum grano salis - an important role. The current situation is no exception, in which the protagonists, the ISAF and ANA on the one hand, and the Taliban on the other, battle for influence and control in the country also through the local population. The Tali- ban rely heavily on income from the opium business and on support stemming from groups within Pakistan's security establishment. The ANA is funded by a group of donor nations. Combat interactions between the two opposing camps resemble a cat-and- mouse game. Based partially in out-of-area safe havens, the Taliban inflict limited losses on the ANA, the ISAF, and their logistics. In case adversary military pres- sure becomes too heavy, the Taliban agilely flow into other areas and continue their operations from there. One Case, Two Models Research Design Armed conflicts and the conflict-torn societies in which they take place are social systems that can be fruitfully studied from a systemic perspective. System dynam- ics models, while often empirically founded and able to reflect a conflict's inher- ent dynamics, only inadequately represent the micro- and meso-levels. Through them, crucial macro-phenomena, such as radicaliza tion, recruitment, etc., cannot be explained from their underlying systemic foundations. Agent-based social simulation complements more orthodox modeling approaches in the endeavor</page><page sequence="6">Armando Geller and Shah Jamal Alam 13 Fig 1. A Hybrid Modeling Approach Linking a Socio-Cultural and -Political Agent-Based Model of Power Structures with a Systems Dynamics Model of Guerrilla Warfare in Afghanistan. "C" denotes casualties, "R" recruitment, and "S" support. to represent and understand the phenomena under study. In agent-based mod- els, agents interact with each other on the basis of a defined set of cognitive and behavioral rules. The execution of rules and how agents behave depends on nec- essary conditions. Sometimes these interactions can lead to (counter-intuitive) emergent phenomena. Agent-based models afford the researcher to precisely scrutinize differing levels of social behavior and organization. Integrating a sys- tem dynamics model with an agent-based model adds new analytical layers to the systemic study of conflict. We present a hybrid modeling approach, in which a socio-cultural and -politi- cal (including the endogenous factors) agent-based model of Afghan power structures is linked with a systems dynamic model of guerrilla warfare (Figure 1; cf. Bobashev et al. 2007). 2 We follow Geller and Moss (2008) and others (for example, Alam et al. 2009) in that we mix a procedural and a declarative model- ing architecture within the agent-based model. While the procedural part is stan- dard procedure for agent-based models, the declarative part and the related expert system shell is especially used to model socio-cultural and -political cogni- tive decision making. Our claim that an endogenized analytical approach is important is thus also methodologically reflected. A Socio-Cultural and -Political Model of Power Structures in Afghanistan The socio-cultural and -political exploration of the notion of power lays bare a society's fundamental modes of cooperation and conflict and affords reflecting on related issues (for example, qawm) from a behavioral as well as from a cogni- tive perspective. Introducing socio-cultural context by means of agent-based mod- eling is conducted most "naturally" on the agent level, where it can be introduced through agent behavior and/or cognition. It is assumed on the basis of reliable evidence that context shapes behavior and cognition, and that behav- ior and cognition shape context (Sperber and Hirschfeld 2004; Sun 2006). The model of Afghan power structures that is used to emulate the socio- and politico-cultural context and into which the guerrilla war systems dynamics model is couched describes the evolution of social networks, in which individuals choose their relations based on a motivation to accumulate and re-distribute material and social resources. While social resources are represented by the 2The source code can be requested from the authors.</page><page sequence="7">14 Modeling the Afghan Conflict agents and their specific types themselves, material resources are represented by some "currency" and poppies. Originally, poppies are distributed only to drug farmers. Currency is distributed to all agents according to a lognormal distribu- tion (elites tend to get a lot more than non-elites). Because Afghanistan is a ren- tier economy, there is, besides poppies and some minor return on investments, no endogenously produced value. Thus, currency is induced exogenously only to the system. Agentization - that is, the definition of the model's agent types and the behav- ior underlying and resulting from inter-agent relationships - is based on empiri- cal evidence. This evidence has been presented above in the form of key concepts, which now need to be "agentized." There are two types of agents: elite and non-elite agents. Elite agents are of the ideal types politician, businessman, commander (a meritocratic title used in Afghanistan for military and militia leaders), religious leader, and organized criminal; non-elite agents are of the types civilian, warrior, farmer, drug-farmer, and drug-dealer (cf. Glatzer 2002). The elite agent types reflect in an agentized way the key concepts elaborated above (Table 1): Politicians stand for political groups that are more often than not founded on ethnic identities and ethnic radicalization; businessmen stand for an economization of the Afghan conflict; commanders are the omnipresent leaders of armed groups; religious leaders reflect the importance of religion; organized criminals stand for the criminalized nature of Afghanistan's political economy. A comparable reasoning applies to non-elite agents. Thirty years of war created a new "profession": the warrior. Because Afghanistan continues to be a country of rural character, introducing an agent of the type farmer is necessary. The cur- rent conflict is also a drug war and introducing drug farmer and dealer agents appears logical. Civilians, finally, make up for the bulk of agents. We do not argue that this list is exhaustive, but, as with the elite agents, it would be hard to justify ignoring these agent types in an agent-based model of the Afghan conflict. Agents can engage in two kinds of relations: patron-client relationships, which materialize between elite and non-elite agents, and affiliations, which materialize between elite and non-elite agents. Affiliations are relations of a "give-and-take" nature between agents of equal status. They are based on notions such as favoritism and nepotism. Between elite and non-elite agents, patron-client relationships are established, expressing a social and material dependence of non-elite on elite agents. The patron-client relationship's ratio- nale is very different than the affiliation's one. Usually, poor non-elite agents - Afghanistan's human development record is dismal - enter a relation- ship with an elite agent to receive some material support. In return, the elite agent expects some kind of service. The content of these relationships - whether of the type affiliations or patron- client - is derived from an agent types' contextual function. For example, in an insecure region a commander's core function is to provide security. In a corrupt system a politician's core function is to act as a stakeholder and facilitator. In a poppy economy a drug farmer needs to look after the poppies, and so forth. The content of these relationships was qualitatively cross-validated on the basis of secondary research and our own field research conducted among Afghan urban elites between 2005 and 2007. If each agent type and its basic relationships with other agents are derived from the case study's empirical evidence, then we arrive at a total number of 172 agent rules. A selection of these rules is presented in Table 2. Table 2 also provides an idea of how the cognitive dimensions mentioned in the case study feed into the model and how action selection and subsequently behavior depend on them. Technically, an agent's cognition is implemented by</page><page sequence="8">Armando Geller and Shah Jamal Alam 15 Table 2.

Moss 1995; Alam et al. 2009). Endorse- ments are labels that agents use to describe certain aspects of other agents. They capture what an agent reasons about other agents. The information col- lected and processed by agents on such issues as religion, ethnicity, kin, reli- ability, loyalty, etc., is of a subjective nature. The process of choosing an agent is not only subjective, but is embedded in an agent's context, that is, the agents visible or known to an agent (cf. Granovetter 1985). As a result of the unique personal attributes each agent exhibits, for example, religion, ethnicity, etc., some agents are more preferable for affiliations or patron-client relation- ships than others, a phenomenon known as homophily. This implies that a chosen agent may not be preferable to differently embedded agents with differ- ent personal attributes. The agents' rules, to summarize, dissect a communication pattern and describe a pattern of power relations which reflects the case study's key con- cepts. The general logic underlying the agent rules has been described afore in terms of: patron-client relationships and affiliations; accumulation and re-distribution of resources. The socio-cultural and -political model of Afghan power structures represents individual interaction processes that are motivated by personal, that is subjective preferences, and that eventually give raise to qawm. There are 208 agents in the model. Pashtun agents account for 40% of the population, Tajik and Uzbek each for 25%, and Hazara for 10%.5 They populate a grid of 70 times 70 cells. The grid is divided into four regions: a Pashtun, a Tajik, an Uzbek, and a Hazara region. There are also three urban areas. Urban areas tend to be heterogeneous; rural areas homogenous. Population figures for Afghanistan are either unavailable or politicized and incorrect. The figures used by us indicate a rough but plausible estimate.</page><page sequence="9">16 Modeling the Afghan Conflict qawm in the Socio-cultural Model The structural fluidity of qawm, in reality and in our model, renders it difficult to establish qawm boundaries. However, for analytical reasons boundaries need to be defined. To do so, we apply a concept from social network analysis. Imagine a society in which each person was closely tied to all others in their own sub-popu- lation (that is, all sub-populations are cliques), and there are no connections at all among sub-populations (that is, each sub-population is a component). Most real populations do not look like this, but the ''ideal type" of a complete con- nection within and complete disconnection between sub-groups is a useful refer- ence point for assessing the degree of "factionalization" in a population (Hanneman and Riddle 2005). Factions are not tantamount to qawm, but they allow analyzing intra- and inter-group relationships. Extracting factions over time in a dynamically changing network is technically difficult and only an approximation to the concept of factions as described afore. We use the community detection algorithm proposed by Girvan and Newman (2002) to extract qawm. This algorithm results in a hierarchical clustering of nodes representing communities in a given network. A community of a sub- graph is a subset of nodes such that the density of links among the nodes within a community is higher than those across the communities. The algorithm uses the edge-betweenness method, originally based on the betweenness centrality of nodes in a network (Wasserman and Faust 1994). Betweenness centrality reflects the idea that actors who lie between the geode- sies of other actors are more central than those who are at the periphery. If more than one geodesic path exist between two nodes in an unweighted graph, all geodesies are equally likely. This centrality measure can be computed even if the given network is fragmented. In the Girvan and Newman's method, instead of trying to construct a measure that tells us which edges are the most central to communities, it focuses on these edges that are least central, the edges that are most "between" communities. The algorithm takes as input the number of edges that are removed iteratively based on the highest score for the edge- betweenness centrality. The sub-graphs resulting from the removal of these edges are termed "communities." In this article, qawm correspond to the extracted community structures. We need to know a qawm's dimensions because each qawm decides whether to support ANA, ISAF or the Taliban, qawm size varies and depends upon how the entire network is being constituted, qawm decide following their extraction from the agents' network at each time step. Each qawm chooses a side based on the majority of votes of the agents constituting it. The entire qawm then supports the ANA, ISAF or the Taliban exclusively in the "Guerrilla war" component of the model.4 A System Dynamics Model of Guerrilla Warfare The system dynamics model is linked with the agent-based model through the actors' preferences based on their respective individual characteristics and their qawm's decision to side with the Afghan National Army, Taliban, or the ISAF. The implementation of the system dynamics model follows our description given above of a guerrilla war. The Taliban, ANA, and ISAF are the main combatants. Their initial strengths are model parameters. All three depend on the civilian population. The Taliban inflict losses on ISAF and the ANA. ISAF, in collaboration with the ANA, inflict 4Note that this is not tantamount to simply implementing a majority vote, as one need to keep in mind the whole process how qawm, and thus opinions, form.</page><page sequence="10">Armando Geller and Shah Jamal Alam 17 losses on the Taliban. These losses - casualties inflicted by one combating side onto the other - are model parameters and are given by y in Equations (1-4). Whichever group is suffering from losses becomes perceived in the population as being unsuccessful. The effect on the Taliban and the ANA from this is that their recruitment rates decrease.5 In a situation as unreckonable as war the pop- ulation tries to be on the "right" side. Equations (3) and (4) express the ANA and Taliban's recruitment rate's sensitivity to the current strength of the oppos- ing side and the support they receive from the population through the qawm.6 If, on the other hand, ANA or the Taliban win battles they become perceived as being successful, as a result of which their recruitment rate increases. dPopulation ^ = -recruitmentconectives + leavingcollectives - ^collectives x collectives (1) = (techonology Factor χ external Support) - /fyTaiiban x Taliban at (2) = recruitmentANA (Population) - leave (Population) - /fyxaiiban x Taliban (3) = recruitmentTaiiban (Population) - leave (Population) - ßyANAANA at - ^Coalition Coalition + poppies (4) ISAF's recruitment process functions differently. It does not recruit from the local population and therefore is less susceptible to losses and wins with regard to recruitment. Recruitment rather depends on other factors, such as economic and political conditions in ISAF supporting countries. We do not model this and instead keep the strength of ISAF constant.7 During combat the opposing groups, the Taliban on the one side and ISAF and ANA on the other, inflict casualties upon the civilian population (Equation I).8 This is modeled as a stochastic process. For the purpose of this article it is not of importance if these losses were deliberately or accidentally inflicted. The popula- tion perceives the group responsible for the civilian casualties as being untrustwor- thy. We take this as a proxy for a group not being able to provide security, a central and recurring issue in Afghanistan and among the Afghan population. Consequen- tially, the population endorses and sides with the group that did not inflict any civilian casualties and provides security. An important parameter in the system dynamics model is the combat effective- ness parameter. The amount of losses inflicted by one group upon its adversary depends on it. Combat effectiveness at a given time is the function of the cur- rent strength of the Taliban, which depends on the recruitment of the local pop- ulation and the support/endorsement by various qawm from the socio-cultural and -political agent-based model. This support depends on the combat success ratio, which is fed into the socio-cultural and -political agent-based model. The same applies to ANA; it also applies to ISAF, but not with regard to recruitment. 5The reverse could be true too, namely that the Taliban are losing the war and that as a result of this the recruitment rate among initially more tacit supporters increases. 6Because of the distribution of ethnicities in the model ANA and Taliban are likely not to get more support in the agent population than 55%. 7Note that losses are not measured in numbers of dead ISAF agents, but indirectly as combat success rate. 8Currently a birth and death processes for the local population is not implemented in the model. Once the Taliban in the model are able to get a sizable support, it remains throughout the simulation run.</page><page sequence="11">18 Modeling the Afghan Conflict Combat effectiveness by default gets reduced for ISAF, ANA, and the Taliban by 10% in case of an untrustworthy endorsement by the population. This can occur every time step according to a stochastic parameter (equally likely for ISAF, ANA, and the Taliban) when a side loses a fight in the model. The other important parameter is the technology factor, which is a scalar fac- tor multiplying combat effectiveness. Whereas the material resources for ISAF as well as the ANA are exogenous, the Taliban's resources are only partly exogenous, as revenue from the drug business makes most of the part for their (endogenous) income. In the guerrilla war model component revenues for poppies are taken into account, which influ- ences the Taliban's combat effectiveness parameters. The Simulation Schedule The endorsement mechanism described previously is implemented in JESS (Friedman-Hill 2003). JESS is a rule-based engine and scripting environment that integrates with the procedural component of the socio-cultural and -political model. Using a rule-based (declarative) approach enables a modeler to easily trace which rules were activated, when, and under what conditions. This means that we know which agent acted when, how, and why. The JESS component is implemented into Repast, a Java agent-based social simulation toolkit with built in scheduling (Figure 2) and visualization methods (North, Collier, and Vos 2006). The Java written systems dynamics model is integrated in Repast. At the start of the simulation, different types of individual agents are created representing the actor types described earlier. Static endorsements are assigned, resulting in an initial artificial social structure. While the simulation continues inter-agent endorsements result in the evolution of small-world like qawm struc- ture (Geller and Moss 2008) representing artificial Afghan power structures. Then each individual agent endorses ANA, ISAF or the Taliban. Finally, qawm choose to support a particular side. The support qawm provide for one of the sides feeds into the model's third component, that is, the system dynamics model, and has an influence on the simulation's macro-outcome.

Results Descriptive Results To develop an understanding of the simulation's micro processes the course of a representative simulation run is described by narrating the "life" of an agent of the type commander.

He scans his proximate surroundings for neighboring agents and is particularly interested in warriors and among these in those who are of his kin and have the same religion and ethnicity. With increasing likeli- hood he endorses warriors who are more similar to him, offers to hire them sub- ject to available funds and pays those he hires. Then the commander endorses several agents for same religion and ethnicity. He continues to hire warriors and pays their salary on a daily basis. He also endorses a politician, a businessman, and a religious leader. At time step 2, the commander mainly hires warriors and pays them. At time step 3, the commander endorses a businessman and a reli- gious leader but is not able to affiliate with either of them, since they do not reciprocate his intentions. Observing the commander provides insight into how he gradually builds up his qawm, namely by constantly watching the area surrounding him for possible affiliations and patron-client relationships. If he finds a suitable agent he endorses it and decides on the basis of the factors mentioned above if he wants to establish a relationship. The ability to accumulate and redistribute resources is vital. The commander is lacking affiliations with businessmen and hence invest- ment opportunities. He soon runs out of money for he has to pay his warriors regularly. Being unable to do so will characterize him as being untrustworthy, as a consequence of which he will be able to establish and maintain less and less social contacts, eventually leading to a "social death." As a neo-patrimonial agent the commander failed. This is the fate of most elite-agents, and only a very small number of them become endowed and power- ful. This is mainly due to a preferential attachment process in which wealthy elite agents become increasingly attractive as affiliates or patrons because they are rec- ommended in a favorable way and increasingly endorsed as successful, reliable, etc. The example demonstrates the model's inherent sociability. The success of every individual, regardless of agent-type, depends on the ability to make use of social resources in ways described afore as pertinent to qawm. How qawm Influence Conflict We now turn to the aggregate level. Figure 3 depicts a snapshot of a representa- tive simulation run from the Afghan power structures model. The lines are links between agents, representing either affiliations or patron-client relationships. The three black blocks represent cities and the four large areas dividing the space represent, clockwise, Pashtun-, Uzbek-, Tajik-, and Hazara-dominated areas. Networks such as the one presented in Figure 3 afford distinguishing factions, that is, artificial qawm. Some of them consist of agents that are of same religion, Fig 3.

Number of Victories for ISAF, ANA, and the Taliban in a Representative Simulation Run. 20 Modeling the Afghan Conflict ethnicity, etc., others are highly heterogeneous. Some of them consist only of non-elite agents, but most of them include also elite agents. Based on their members, qawm make decisions whether to support the Tali- ban, ISAF or ANA. This has a significant impact on the model outcome. Figure 4 shows the number of victories for ISAF, ANA, and the Taliban in a representative simulation run. At each time step, the Taliban fight against both the ANA and ISAF forces. Notice that in the first few time steps, both ISAF and ANA win against the Taliban. This is due to the initial troop strengths allocated to the three parties and the technology factor, which gives ISAF a clear edge over the Taliban. Moreover, the negative feedback from earlier losses decreases the com- bat strength of the Taliban in these initial steps. From the moment on the Tali- ban in the model start to gain local support as a result of socio-cultural familiarity, their combat effectiveness and recruitment rate increase. In Figure 4 the Taliban not only gain an advantage due to the local support based on ethnic- ity and religion, but also based on whether they are perceived as being trustwor- thy or not. The ANA loses most of its battles (see Figure 4) . This is due to the fact that it enjoys less support from the local population, which in turn affects its recruit- ment and combat efficiency against the Taliban. However, in later steps ANA starts winning against the Taliban as a consequence of ISAF's victories against the Taliban. Increase in the Taliban losses lead to increasing untrustworthiness of the Taliban among the population. This decreases the Taliban's combat effi- ciency, which makes them lose also against ANA. Next, we explore model parameters that are related to the local support for Taliban against ISAF and ANA. Two different cases are depicted in Figures 5 and 6. In the first case (Figure 5), ISAF does not lose support from the local popula- tion due to civilian casualties. In the second case (Figure 6), ISAF loses support. Consequently there is a 10% loss of their combat effectiveness in the simulation. A summary of all configurations for Figures 5 to 9 is provided in Table 3. In the first case (Figure 5), four time series plots each representing four simu- lation configurations and their respective average outcomes over 10 simulation runs are presented. We are interested in whether there is an effect on the ran- dom reduction of the recruited Taliban, the number of Taliban remains to the Ο ι 1 Ο _ *~ - Taliban --- ISAF ANA ο 00 ~ 1 ο &lt;&lt;* - °- // ο - ^- / 0 20 40 60 80 100 Time</page><page sequence="14">Armando Geller and Shah Jamal Alam 21 ο Ι Ι ο Ι m _ . . in - . .

All other parameter values remain constant, including the technology factor, which is set to 4.0 (that is, lower than the one used in Figure 4). In Figure 5a the chance for the Taliban to lose local support is set to 25%; in Figure 5b to 35%; in Fig- ure 5c,d to 45%. In Figure 5d, we additionally increase the upper limit for local support by 30%. Figure 5 underlines the importance of local support and explains why the Tali- ban keep an upper hand over the coalition. The population endorses ISAF nega- tively, in particular with regards to kinship, ethnicity, religion, and neighborhood. Consequentially, ISAF does not get the support of a qawm. The Taliban, on the other hand, get the highest endorsements in terms of shared ethnicity (particu- larly from the agents with Pashtun ethnicity) and same religion. The ANA too receives local support in the model, in particular from agents with a non-Pashtun ethnic background. However, in absolute numbers this is less support than the Taliban get. The averages for the four configurations in Figure 5 show slight vari- ation in the combat outcomes; however the time series in each case also vary due to stochastic effects. We can conclude that, when the technology factor is kept at a low level, the Taliban in the model win the majority of the combats against both ISAF and ANA as a result of the local support they can rely on.</page><page sequence="15">22 Modeling the Afghan Conflict in _ . 10 - . .

In the second case (Figure 6), we further explore the likelihood for the Tali- ban to lose local support. We do this in order to test the sensitivity of the param- eter and its effect on the model output. In all configurations in case two the technology factor parameter is set to 4.5. The number of edges to be removed in extracting the qawm is set to 300 (default value 100). In configuration 1 (Figure 6a, top left) we increase the chances for losing support to 55%. In other words, ANA and the Taliban's size are limited. If no support is lost, nothing hap- pens. If support is lost, then a random number is drawn between the range of [5, 15]. This model parameter defines how much support is lost. In configura- tion 2 (Figure 6b) the range is increased to [15, 25], all other things being equal. Configuration 3 (Figure 6c) has the same range as configuration 2, but the chance to lose support is reduced to 45%. Finally, in configuration 4 (Fig- ure 6d) the likelihood to lose support is equal to the one in configuration 3, that is, 45%, but the range is [5, 15] as in configuration 1. Compared to Figure 6a, the average combat success ratio for ISAF increases in configuration 2 (Figure 6b). This follows from the fact that the Taliban in the model get less local support, which affects their performance against ISAF.

Figures 6c,d. Note that in these two configurations, both the technology factor and the upper bound for the Taliban's local support are kept low. The average combat success ratios for ISAF, ANA, and the Taliban show a different pattern than in the previous two configurations. On one hand, a low technology factor constrains ISAF's successes, while on the other hand lowering the upper limit for local support limits ANA and Taliban's successes in the model. How does technology influence the combat success rate? We explore three simulation configurations. In Figure 7a, the technology factor for ISAF is set to 6. In Figure 7b combat effectiveness reduction is disabled. In Figure 7c more sub-graphs (qawm) are allowed in the network. That is, when the network is split into more subgraphs by removing twice the edges based on their edge-between- ness. Figure 7a indicates that increasing the technology factor in favor of ISAF nulli- fies the Taliban's support in the population as a result of losing and empowers ISAF to outperform the Taliban with regard to most of the fighting. The losses inflicted upon the Taliban by the strengthened ISAF negatively affect the Tali- ban's combat effectiveness and their performance against ANA too. The model outcome is sensitive to the technology factor parameter.

What are the effects different qawm sizes and configurations have on combat effectiveness, and number of victories? The Taliban have a chance to lose local support, which may account for other factors such as civilian casualties, external influences and incentives for the local population offered by ISAF and ANA. qawm structures are extracted with 100, 200, and 300 edges to be removed.9 The technology factor is kept constant. Figures 8a-c show the average combat success ratios for the Taliban, ANA, and ISAF corresponding to the removal of 100, 200, and 300 edges respectively. In Figure 8a the extracted qawm does not correspond significantly with the ethnic and religious divide among agents (Table Al in the appendix). The network rep- resenting the local population is thus split into fewer components having a high degree of heterogeneity of the agents. As we progress toward the removal of 200 and 300 edges, qawm homogeneity increases, qawm start containing agents that share same ethnicity and other attributes. However, some qawm continue to °We report on the extracted qawm for the two cases and their three different inputs for the Girvan and Newman algorithm in Tables Al and A2 in the appendix, available at http://sites.google.com/site/armandogeller/files/Geller Alam20 1 0_ISR_Appendix.pdf.</page><page sequence="18">Armando Geller and Shah Jamal Alam 25 ίο - . .

This is due to spatial proximity as well as links (though few) that are formed across the grid in the model. In this case, the qawm configuration affects the macro-output. An increase in the number of sub-graphs in a network implies that agents who are otherwise a minority, for example, Tajik and Hazara, form a clique so that their preference for a side is not affected by agents belonging to the Pashtun majority. This may result in a decrease in the number of agents recruited from the local population, almost half of which is Pashtun. In Figure 9, we look at three configurations in which ANA may be more likely to receive the support from more qawm. This affects the average combat success ratio for the Taliban, in particular when further edges are removed. In the first configu- ration, Figure 9a, we set the technology factor to 6.0 and remove 300 edges in qawm extraction. For configurations (b) and (c) we removed 500 edges for extract- ing the qawm with lower technology factors for the coalition, that is, 5.0 in Fig- ures 9b and 5.5 in Figure 9c. For all three configurations, we increase the upper limit for the local recruitment of the local population by ANA from 25% to 35%. The contrasting result in the first two configurations is due to the lower technology factor, which impedes ISAF's successes in the second configuration.

This is supported by the higher number of extracted qawm resulting from the edge betweenness algorithm in the simulation. Identifying boundaries and extracting qawm in the model have implications for both the Taliban and ANA in the model as they recruit and rely on the local agent population. ISAF, by contrast, relies on its technology factor: A higher technology factor in the model gives it the decisive edge over the Taliban. In our model, a lower technology factor for the ISAF could be compensated with local support. Implications for Forecasting and Early Warning Systems Early Warning Systems should combine "multiple approaches to both collection and analysis of information [...]" (Davies and Gurr 1998:9). Of particular inter- est are integrative approaches that afford the analysis of: conditions and struc- tural contexts as well as certain event clustering that forego the outbreak of armed violence; triggers and processes that catalyze such outbreaks; particular combinations of indicators that raise a red flag (cf. Austin 2004). An inherent feature of agent-based modeling is to afford systemic explanation for such causal- ities. Of interest are not only correlations, but also underlying mechanisms. From a complexity theory perspective, it seems to be apt to be prudent with any kind of point prediction. We perhaps know what to expect (perhaps even in terms of an event's frequency), but we do not know when to expect it. By know- ing what to expect we mean that we can conclude from the existence of particu- lar cognitive (for example, radicalization), behavioral (for example, individual violence), processual (for example, recruitment), and structural (for example, group-formation) pre-dispositions a major outbreak in violence (for example, factional fighting with civilian casualties). There are nevertheless limits to early warning endeavors in the Afghan conflict (cf. Glatzer 2001:388).</page><page sequence="20">Armando Geller and Shah Jamal Alam 27 The type of modeling applied by us allows for faction analyses of groups (here qawm) involved in conflict. Potential lines of conflict can be identified across and within factions. Among factions these are: between radical factions, between heterogeneous and radical factions, and between heterogeneous factions. The reasons for conflict along these lines can be of ethnic, religious, and political nature. They may result from a resource gap between two factions or they can stem from a faction's decision to expand at the expense of another faction. Radi- cal groups can potentially play the ethnic and religious card against heteroge- neous factions. Finally, relatively more powerful factions can try to merge with less powerful factions or less powerful factions can form alliances with factions of similar socio-political structure against more powerful factions. Within qawm fault lines can emerge as a result of two competing elite actors of the same type, that is, two commanders, politicians, religious leaders, etc. Another potential fault line is that some agents within a qawm are monetarily bet- ter off than other agents. This is tantamount to a socio-economic conflict arising in a dense social network. Finally, ethnic and religious conflict within qawm of heterogeneous nature is possible too. In our simulations, we find, in congruence with circumstantial evidence, that qawm can take many forms. They can be, for example, homogeneously composed along ethnic lines. But they can also be of ethnically and religiously heteroge- neous nature. We also find evidence for such ethnic and religious diversity as well as role pluralism as prerequisites for the formation of a successful qawm. In any case, the success of an individual, regardless of agent-type, depends on the individual's ability to make use of social resources (cf. Geller and Moss 2008). The micro-level implication for early warning systems and forecasting is that likely only detailed knowledge about local power relations affords anticipation of future events. Obtaining this kind of knowledge requires long-term immersion and intimate intelligence (espionage). There is, however, a more general implication. Only inclusive strategies that embrace also relevant spoilers will work in Afghanistan. Through their qawm spoilers have a firm grip on parts of Afghan society to the point where they are able to create an alternative governance structure. Simulation results also suggest that macro-outcomes of the conflict are sensi- tive to the technology factor, support of the local population, and the underlying social structure. Given extant knowledge on guerrilla warfare and insurgencies this is not too surprising. Interesting, however, is the insight that ISAF's successes are almost insensitive to the support of the local population, but very sensitive to technology, and that the Taliban's successes are, by contrast, sensitive to local support. The finding that when technology is kept at a low level the Taliban win most of the battles while when high-tech is applied, ISAF and ANA emerge as winners may be related to Hirshleifer's (1991) paradox of power. The paradox states that the weak side wins when the strong side is engaged only half-heartedly, but gets crushed when the stakes are high and the strong side is dedicated to use its full potential. For prediction purposes the implication is that public opinion and military technology are only expressive predictors when applied in a combined manner. The policy implication would be that although a "hearts and minds" strategy seems to be important, it is of limited success and the focus should lie on a high-tech kinetic approach. The appointment of General Stanley A. McChrystal, a former commander of the Joint Special Operations Command, as the new American commander in Afghanistan on May 11, 2009, underlines this point. Our simulation results also suggest that ANA is only able to win against the Taliban on the shoulders of ISAF or if it manages to increase its support among the population. From a military perspective the former is already</page><page sequence="21">28 Modeling the Afghan Conflict practiced, in the sense that ANA and ISAF closely collaborate. How ANA can be transformed from a corrupt ragtag army into a credible security provider is another issue. Finally, simulation results suggest that as long as support for the Taliban does not decrease, a change in the qawm structure does not affect population support in general. The reason for this lies in the fact that the Taliban's main support is within the Pashtun population, who has a relative majority in Afghanistan. From other conflicts, for example, Israel-Palestine and Northern Ireland, we know about the importance of population dynamics for public decision making and forecasting. The policy implication for Afghanistan would be that whoever plays the "Pashtunistan" card will have a relative majority. Conclusions Socio-cultural and -political context is an important explanans for conflict. It is not only shaped by our behavior (anthropomorphism), but also shapes our behavior, often through cognitive processes resulting in distinct socio-cultural and -political conflict patterns, qawm, Afghan opportunistic solidarity networks, are a useful proxy of such patterns. We demonstrated that studying conflict through qawm and hence socio-cultural and -political processes and structures is not only promising, but necessary. On one hand we followed an endogenous and generative modeling approach. "qawm ontologies" are devised to codify individual actors, their behavior and relations between actors, as well as social processes and structures arising as a result of social interaction. On the other hand, we pursued an orthodox model- ing strategy by implementing guerrilla warfare in Afghanistan as a dynamic model. Simulation results suggest that conflict macro-outcomes are influenced by technology, population support, and social structure. Results also suggest that these factors are mutually dependent and unequally favoring different conflict parties through such mechanisms as homophily, preferential attachments, and the paradox of power. This research is currently in a preliminary status. Further parameter space exploration, sensitivity analyses and robustness tests need to be conducted. Fore- casts and policy implications should therefore be seen with the necessary pru- dence. Nevertheless, the type of hybrid modeling applied here can be of great use for forecasting and policy making. This is particularly the case because the type of socio-cultural and -political pattern prediction we suggest also enables explanation for why a certain outcome is likely. A desideratum remains: Future research - potentially cross-culturally - will need to focus on dissecting which socio-cultural and political-factors lead to which outcomes on the macro-level.
