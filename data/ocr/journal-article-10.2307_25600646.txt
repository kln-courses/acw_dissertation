<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SUBLIME: A FORUM PAUL H. FRY The Possession of the Sublime What is the sublime? The unexpected affirmation of an overwhelm ing moral force: that is one definition. But the other definition is equally good, which recognizes the sublime also where the force which affirms itself is certainly overwhelming, but immoral and destructive. Both remain vague and lack precision, until applied to a concrete case, to an example which makes clear what is meant by "overwhelming," and what by unexpected. (Benedetto Croce, Aesthetic) I An epigraph should stand by itself, and the present essay would go forward with greater confidence if this one could do so, but its context does require comment. Croce dislikes the sublime as much as he dislikes any other aesthetic category, and ignores it in his book apart from this passage, which concludes: "They [the overwhelming and the unexpected] are quantitative concepts, but falsely quantitative, since there is no way of measuring them; they are at bottom metaphors, emphatic phrases, or logical tautologies."1 Probably so: but it remains a question whether the "quantity" of the sublime is really a matter of mass or degree when it is so obviously, as Croce acknowledges, an unstable compound. It is a quantity, yes, but the measure involved concerns movement, a movement that is stably discernible not as a rate but as a structure of exchange, and this moreover of the special kind that arises from delusion. Not a handy form of communication or a bargain quickly agreed upon, the sublime is the happily deluded gesture of resistance to the doom of take-over that proclaims subjection to be autonomy. i.

FRY Longinus was the first to understand the "great" (megethos) or high (hupsos) kinetically rather than statically. His sublime is a quality, but it is only inferentially a transcendent one. Its special character is to appear only in its alienability and as a mode of alienation. Ekstasis typically means standing (statically) outside oneself, but in the Peri Hupsous it can only be translated as "transport," a movement from "the orator's whole power" to the receptivity of the auditor, who appropriates this power in turn: "Filled with joy and pride, we come to believe we have created what we have only heard" (chs. i: 4, vu: 2).2 We become the orator in turn and pass sublimity along, like the volatile and excited Longinus himself. Inevitably, then, as a number of modern commentators have observed,3 the Longinian sublime appears in a climate of antagonism, as a rivalry between authors most memorably exhibited in the shrewd recognition that Plato competes "for the prize against Homer" (xm: 4). Longinus interestingly exemplifies this intimation of hostility in hav ing stolen it from Hesiod: "'this strife is good for men,'" he quotes casually, as if to suggest that in saying this Hesiod had been speaking of something other than literary rivalry. But in the Works and Days the rivalry between authors is already an established theme upon which Longinus, with his splendid similitude of the Pythian priestess impreg nated through a rift in the ground, can only suggestively elaborate. Although the concept would have been at home in the Theogony, with its wars on Olympus, in Hesiod's georgic poem it appears on a down to-earth occasion. The "strife" Hesiod has in mind is already the healthy competition enshrined by modern Capitalism: 2. All quotations of Longinus are from "Longinus on the Sublime," trans. D. A. Russell, in Ancient Literary Criticism, ed. Russell and M. Winterbottom (Oxford: Clarendon, 1972), cited by chapter. Russell, it must be confessed, is the sole translator who translates ekstasis as "ecstasy." 3.

Ferguson (292) summarizes the issue involved here as follows: "While [the] overwhelming occurs as a dispossession for the speaker (the destinateur) it proceeds to yield a possession for the hearer (the destinataire) as the initial sense of being overwhelmed and scattered gives way to the listener's feeling [that he has himself produced what he has heard]."</page><page sequence="3">THE POSSESSION OF THE SUBLIME 189 So neighbour vies with neighbour in the rush For wealth: this strife is good for mortal men? Potter hates potter, carpenters compete, And beggar strives with beggar, bard with bard.4 In speaking as we shall of the sublime as a struggle for "possession," the possessor's resistance to being possessed, we cannot overlook the sense in which possession is also property, remembering that literary copyright and the fear of plagiary are the material equivalents of the anxiety of influence. There exists a sustained piece of anthropological fieldwork by Michael Taussig, The Devil and Commodity Fetishism in South America, in which the fine Marxian ambiguity of "possession" is duly explored.5 A material explanation might well be offered in response to the ques tion I wish to explore in this essay, the question how and why Edmund Burke comes so emphatically to introduce "fear," the one new element in the theory of the sublime in the period between Boileau and Kant.6 I do not propose to approach this question by discussing either Burke or his times in any detail, but if I were to do so the material explanation would be a tempting one. It could be argued that the alienation effect of terror was fundamentally social, that the empirical approach to sub lime affectivity in the Enquiry already reflects the antagonism of early Capitalist labor relations, or reflects in any case the early gestures toward social revolution in America (a cause Burke supported) and faintly in augurates the dialectic of events and ideas in rivalry that culminates in that "Terror" on which all theorists and poets of the sublime could only gaze in reproof. "Un gouvernement r?publicain a la vertu pour prin cipe," cried Saint-Just, "sinon le terreur. Que veulent ceux qui ne veulent ni vertu ni terreur? [A republican government has virtue for its guiding principle. If not, terror. What could be the desire of those who want neither virtue nor terror?]."7 Here in tandem are Longinus's "persua sion" (peitho) and "transport" (ekstasis; i: 4), Burke's Beautiful and Sub lime, played out in earnest as the alternatives of self-possession and take 4- Hesiod, Works and Days, in Hesiod and Theognis, trans.

Those who "want neither" are corrupt politically and aesthetically in equal measure. These flourishes of historical analogy are interesting, perhaps, and perhaps usefully suggestive, but my purpose in bringing in Longinus here and elsewhere is in fact to qualify the lure of period-specificity. Let us agree that the sublime is a drama of power, and let us agree also that this drama inspires not only hostility but fear, at least from Burke forward, because it reflects the existence of and resistance to exploitation in society. The problem remains that the adequacy of this thesis, or better, the range of uses one can find for it, comes into question not when one "brackets" history but rather when one reflects upon it. As a poetic trope, free enterprise, as we have seen, already exists in Hesiod? and in the poetic rivalries of rival laborers in Theocritean pastoral. Either the poets are prophets of free enterprise or else they suggest to us that the Utopian notion of pre-capitalism is itself poetry, a myth that is as ahistorical as Marx's myth of the happy Greeks. If immemorial competition has itself always engendered fear and ex ploitation, then, and the Second Discourse of Burke's contemporary Rous seau is in no doubt about the emergence of these conditions in pre history, we still have no conclusive answer for the question why this theme surfaces in discussions of the sublime only in the mid-Eighteenth Century. But we do have a partial answer, one from which the narrower investigation I have in mind should be understood to proceed. In Burke's time the concept of individualism was tightening its hold on social discourse, presenting itself increasingly as a universal. With the realiza tion of individuality comes the awareness of alienation, and in this moment the time is at hand for Adam Smith, for the rise of metaphysics with its unremitting Gegenst?ndlichkeit, for the discovery by Sir Fredrick Herschel in 1781 of an almost incommensurably estranged planet to be named for the father of all competition, Uranos?and, for that matter, for the conclusion abovementioned by Rousseau that competition is not historical but the state of society itself. Arguably, in that case, at the time when the scandal of power emerges irrepressibly from the discov ery of the "object over against" oneself, the philosophers defensively fall back on the timelessness of a poetic trope. The trope in question represents finite, temporal authority as tran scendental determinacy. The authority that in poetic discourse had al ways been ceded to the divine is now assigned by anthropological discourse to "human nature"; and it is in the guise of human nature that superstition returns to constitute the Enlightenment from which it has been banished. As the divine meanwhile loses its definite shape and contours (except for Blake, whose emphasis on "outline" and polemic against chiaroscuro are motivated by these trends), it becomes simple</page><page sequence="5">THE POSSESSION OF THE SUBLIME 191 otherness, in a sense space itself, and the idea of boundlessness comes to dominate the theory of the sublime, first in the form of objects too vast to possess and then, with Kant, in the form of the self-possessed subjective category that finds objects wanting. Thomas Weiskel has influentially characterized these two versions of the calculated failure of representation as "the excess," respectively, either of "signified" or of "signifier. "8 In Harold Bloom's rendering of this post-Miltonic phenomenon, which is the repression in either case of the spectral precursor's identi fication as the sublime, the proclaimed excess of the signified is called ascesis and the proclaimed excess of the signifier is called daemonization, the reconstitution of power as one's own voice.9 But here again one is forced to question "history." Why "post-Miltonic" only? I have argued elsewhere that the anxiety of influence, Weiskel's "semiotic discontinu ity,"10 is already theorized?and exemplified?in Longinus, not just in the conceits of impregnation and strife or in the fantasies of Demosthenes punching his audience and the magistrate's resentment of the orator, but as a system of tropes of discontinuity, a system within which the gap between self-understanding and the understanding of another is itself the "misreading" that is required for the sublime as a triumph of the signifier?of one's own voice?to appear in posse.11 It is both the con creteness and the continued presence of these rhetorical devices, espe cially hyperbaton, asyndeton, and anaphora (which motivates the nec essary structure of doubling), that inform and also authorize, for me, the readings of Milton, Keats, and Wordsworth with which I shall conclude. But first let us by all means save whatever can be saved for history. What does change in the mid-Eighteenth Century? What might there be besides the overwhelming priority of Milton in English litera ture that prompts William Collins even before Burke to exclaim, "Ah, Fear, oh frantic fear, I feel thee near" ("Ode to Fear" [1746])? The word "fear" is released from its Aristotelian moorings in the history of criticism at just the point when theological fear gives way to spiritual anxiety.

Even during the period of this decline, the proximity of the Hebrew God is never lost sight of in English thinking about the sublime, which is authorized in part by Longinus's admiration of Genesis 1.3; but I want to suggest here that that continuous topic, which gains its impetus not so much perhaps from Longinus as from the criticism of John Dennis, serves to mask another and more uneasy one.12 It is all very well for Burke and others, most notably Lord Kames, to have played on the ambiguity of such terms as the "terrible" and the "awful" to suggest the easy resolution of oppressive dread into reverent humility, the former being the "momen tary check" of the sublime, its humiliating moment, the latter being its Leibnizian function in the economy of spiritual life. But one's mistrust of this facile move, and the key to the historical part of the thesis I wish to present, can be located in the double duty performed by the single word "fear." In the very vehemence with which the "fear of God," always the Hebrew God, persists, one can suspect the suppression of the Devil, who has been exiled from the polite world as a peasant bogey and whose force indeed continues unabated only in populist religions. It is the language of fear that continues to suggest the overlap of identities one should expect?if Freud is right in Totem and Taboo and in an essay I shall consider below?from the cultural ambivalence toward the pa triarchal that results in the splitting of unified divine images into good and bad agencies.13 The degree to which this process is at work even in the most sophisticated thinking is apparent in the Meditations of Des cartes, who first wonders whether God might have "tricked" him into trusting his own cognitive powers but then recoils from that blasphemy and assigns the trickster role instead to a demon (malin g?nie).14 I shall wish to argue in what follows, in any case, that the sublime at its apogee and prior to its disappearance into the romantic concept of Imagination, is the naturalized moment of demonic possession, when the personhood of God "uncircumscrib'd retires" (Milton) and diabolical tyranny is sublimated as sheer necessity. 12.

Neil Hertz has shown that repetition compulsion in Freud, a structure rather than an object of affectivity, is invisible except insofar as it is "colored" by the appearance of its double, the uncanny.16 And so it is with the sublime, a movement that is repetitive in part because it involves the confrontation with a double? a double however that is invisible until it is troped either conservatively as an alien being, malign simply in being determinate (demon, daemon, witch, ghost, incubus), or progressively as the self-recognition (and hence, objectification) of some faculty of mind. The trend toward "internalization" one traces in the traditional history of Eighteenth-Century ideas must therefore be understood in this case more rigorously as a dialectical sequence: consciousness of the diabolical is represented as an internalization, as a being-possessed, while the suc ceeding daemonization of the mind itself externalizes mind for exhibit as an objective, perhaps transcendent power. It is Hegel's objection to the sublime of Kant that in the Critique of Judgment the full recursivity of this sequence is not registered. In leaping undialectically to the con clusion that the sublime is subjective, in Hegel's view Kant hypostasizes the constitutive moment of the subject as though it transcended its historical emergence within his own critique. (Prefiguring Croce, Hegel finds no philosophical interest in the sublime because he sees it as a merely affective phenomenon among other aprioristic illusions of his torical consciousness.) He writes: This outward shaping which is itself annihilated in turn by what it reveals, so that the revelation of the content is at the same time a supercession of the revelation, is the sublime. This, therefore, dif fering from Kant, we need not place in the pure subjectivity of the mind and its Ideas of Reason; on the contrary, we must grasp it as 15- Cited by Weiskel, The Romantic Sublime 3. 16.

FRY grounded in the one absolute substance qua the content which is to be represented.17 Thus Hegel returns the analysis of the sublime to the more traditional moment in which the signifier is defeated by the signified, having shown that it is precisely on the occasion of its triumph that the (Kantian) signifier reveals its inadequacy. "The sublime is that," Kant had fa mously said, "the mere ability to think which shows a faculty of mind surpassing every standard of sense."18 We are somehow lulled by this definition, Hegel indicates, into thinking that something, the sublime, has been defined, whereas in fact the sublime remains an unspecified object of thought, and thereby escapes back into the realm of the signified whence it came. Hegel in his turn does not name this object, being at pains chiefly to avoid confusing it with Absolute Spirit, but his location of it in his history of the arts primarily in the content of the Hebrew Bible should give us a clue. In his critique of Kant in this regard Hegel does not mention Schiller, the Kantian whose service to the master was mainly figurai, and whose coloration of the austere Kantian categories results, again concerning the sublime, in the notion of a "pure daemon. " Not a demon, to be sure, and purified of any possible chthonic residue; but in this hedging itself we may find reflected the kind of sublimation we have already noted in the linkage of the sublime to the attitude of reverence. Schiller's evasion, in recognizing which Hegel may have achieved a more concrete understanding of Kant's, becomes unmistake able if we detect the origin in the Hebrew Bible of Schiller's attempt to place the sublime on an ethical footing. "Let us imagine a man with all the virtues of which the union constitutes a fine character," he writes, and goes on to question whether we can ever quite trust the virtues of a person on whom good fortune has been showered and for whom the practice of virtue may be nothing more than an effusion of well-being. Virtue must be tested by adversity: "Let us suppose that this same man falls suddenly under misfortune. " He gets sick, his loved ones die, he is betrayed by his friends. If he remains virtuous, says Schiller, "We must then give up all natural explanation" for his character and accept the Kantian conclusion: "the sublime opens to us a road to overstep the limits of the world of sense, in which the feeling for the beautiful world 17- G.

Not only Schiller but the entire Eighteenth Century makes Job the Ur text of the sublime, but in disregarding the plot and emphasizing the wild imagery of the Voice in the Whirlwind, the characteristic reflections on Job accomplish just the evasion that is pointed toward in the historical dimension of my argument. So dynamic and sinister?so daemonic?in itself is the Voice of the creative demiurge in Job that it can at once take into itself and allow the repression of the true catalyst of Job's patience and reward, "the Satan."20 The exceptional writers who do remember the plot of Job, like Goethe, avoid the uncanniness of demonic possession in their conceptions of the Devil by looking back to the popular genres?Morality Plays, cautionary pamphlets, and the Puppentheater?in which the Devil in human dress seems ? finite and limited creature. In the Eighteenth Century the sub lime Devil disappears from literature, leaving behind him only dapper pre-Mephistophelean demons like Le Sage's Asmodeus and Cazotte's "Diable amoureux," who in turn influence the urbane dandies of Col eridge in "The Devil's Thoughts" and of Byron in "The Devil's Drive" and The Vision of Judgment. In romanticism, and in the literature that precedes it, the repressed Satan returns as the sublime. In Faust, it is not Mephisto but rather the Promethean rhetoric of Faust himself that pos sesses and deludes him. In the "Satanic" Byron, the Devil in person is by no means always a Byronic Hero. And in the copious literature on the sublime, even among the citations of Job, the Devil is never men tioned unless it is Milton's devil. Again, however, one may question whether the disruption of what Schiller calls "this beautiful world" by the sublime is as historically conditioned as it seems. The antinomy of virtue and terror that we have seen played out in unconscious analogy by the contemporaries Schiller and Saint-Just is already present in the Longinian thunderbolt (hurled as if by a patriarchal, undivided Zeus) which "tears everything up like a whirlwind" (i: 4). In Longinus as in Hegel the sublime violates form; a 19- Friedrich Schiller, "The Sublime," Schiller's Aesthetical Essays (Bohn Library: no title page) 134-35. 20.

There appears to be little difference between these observations in Longinus, together with his concluding chapter on the unavailability of the sublime to his materialistic contemporaries, and the summary passage in Schiller that concludes the ghostly Job-plot we have been following: It is not little by little (for between absolute dependence and absolute liberty there is no possible transition), it is suddenly and by a shock that the sublime wrenches our spiritual and independent nature away from the net which feeling has spun round us and which enchains the soul more tightly because of its subtle texture.21 And the stability of this topic neither begins with Longinus nor ends with Schiller. Homer's net of Hephaestus and the myriad nets of Aes chylus's Oresteia already comprise a critique of the beautiful; and for the "shock" of the sublime?although by this time it is dwindling toward the uncanny?we can read Walter Benjamin's studies of Baudelaire. Even at present, for that matter, as Ronald Paulson has aptly inferred from the view held in common by a series of articles in a special journal issue devoted to the sublime, "the beautiful has come to seem an agent of repression."22 Ill But the theme we have saved for history is the displacement of the Devil as the sublime. Why does this happen? Why is Milton's Satan the last of his kind? In order to answer these questions we shall have to say a few things more about the "dialectic of Enlightenment" to which we have earlier alluded in passing. The apothegm of Bacon, that "there is a superstition in avoiding superstition" ("Of Superstition") still bears repeating, although it is perhaps more obvious today, owing to the hindsight of Adorno and Horkheimer in particular, that the banishment of superstition is simply its introjection. What we once feared we now are. The vow to "fear myself" with which Shelley concludes his suita bly-entitled "Hymn to Intellectual Beauty" is an emblem of this tran sition. The anxiety of influence makes the self the daemon, repressing what Longinus had theorized once for all as the reciprocity of possession: overwhelmed by the power of the orator, the auditor retrenches, resists the invasion, and lays claim to that power in turn by means of the 21. Schiller, "The Sublime" 136. 22. Paulson, "Versions of a Human Sublime" NLH 16 (1985): 428.</page><page sequence="11">THE POSSESSION OF THE SUBLIME 197 illusory internalization of the other that constitutes, in Hegel's view, the Kantian sublime. From the?no doubt weaker?standpoint of dialectical interpretation, however, the assertion of the self as origin is revealed to be founded on the denial that the self has resisted the invasive demon "almost successfully" (Wallace Stevens, Adagia) by growing demonic in turn and possessing the other. To claim originality is to repress the proprietary dynamic of the intertextual economy.23 As in the genealogy of vampirism, one represses Satan by taking over his role. This view of possession parallels the historical dialectic we remarked earlier: the in vasion of the external is supplanted historically, just as it is in the individual experience, by the psychopathology, the reified alienation as object, of the internal. It is reserved almost alone for Hegel, again, to document this funda mental, saving illusion among his contemporaries as the Master-Slave dialectic; but Hegel's awareness is also preserved, surprisingly, along some of the generic back roads of literary history where the demonic never disappears. To cite a Gothic example first given in this context by Mario Praz, Lady Caroline Lamb's Glenarvon (1815), a novel written to exorcize the demon of Lord Byron from the author's breast, clearly understands that the best defense is a vampirism of one's own. As Praz summarizes the outcome, the devil who carried off Ruthven Glenarvon "for the occasion assumed the shape of the [female] victims' ghosts."24 The same ambivalence within the balance of power still characterizes the Gothic of Freud's case studies, as a recent historian of the Fantastic has remarked: "The Rat Man feels his own uncanniness only when he attributes omnipotence to his thoughts, that is, when he believes himself to be different from others."25 It is of course Freud, with his reification of the unconscious as alien, who is most alert to the mutuality of possession; and yet, as Neil Hertz has argued, Freud the literary interpreter is likely to omit those moments in which this mutuality is most obvious. E. T. A. Hoffmann's The Sandman, Freud's main exhibit in "The Uncanny," is a Gothic text in which the identity of the possessor is not repressed. The element of the lawyer Coppelius is fire, a "circle of fire," and he possesses the demonic power of metamorphosis. We know the answer then to Nathanael's 23. Neil Hertz has characterized self-awareness in the experience of "blockage," the moment of resistance to the sublime, as "the sense of containing the object, but also (with a hint of theological paradox) being filled by it" ("The Notion of Blockage" 71). 24.

FRY anguished question, "Whose horrible voice is this?" in a passage ignored by Freud and quoted by Hertz, a passage I wish to quote again as an instance of the sublime that is, at least structurally, apparent to "every body all the time" (Longinus vi: 4). In an attempt to exorcize his demons, especially the childhood memory of Coppelius throwing his father's eyes into the fire and a more recent fantasy of being thrown into the fire himself, Nathanael composes a poem: W?hrend Nathanael dies dichtete, war er sehr ruhig und besonnen, er feilte und besserte an jeder Zeile, und da er sich dem metrischen Zwange unterworfen, ruhte er nicht, bis alles rein und wohlklin gend sich f?gte. Als er jedoch nun endlich fertig geworden und das Gedicht f?r sich laut las, da fa?te ihn Grausen und wildes Entsetzen, und er schrie auf: "Wessen grauenvolle Stimme ist das?" Bald schien ihm jedoch das Ganze wieder nur eine sehr gelungene Dichtung.26 [While Nathanael was composing this, he was very calm and self possessed (besonnen); he polished and revised every line, and where he felt himself constrained by the meter, he did not rest content until it all fit together cleanly and euphoniously. However, when he was finally finished and read the poem aloud to himself, then horror and wild fright seized him, and he cried out: "Whose horrible voice is this?" But soon again the whole seemed to him merely a very successful poem.] But his betrothed, Klara, knows better, and hopes to exorcize Nathan ael's offspring, the poem, as one in the series of the demonically pos sessed, by consigning it to the fate of Nathanael's father and?in his fantasy?himself: "'Nathanael?mein herzlicher Nathanael! Wirf das tolle?unsinnige?wahnsinnige M?rchen ins Feuer ['Nathanael?my be loved Nathanael!?Throw that raving?nonsensical?insane fairy tale into the fire']" (ibid). Like the pellucid "Klara," the poem carefully composed by the self-possessed Nathanael is "gelungen," trimly first rate: she and it are "persuasion," the beautiful. But the "other" poem, the demonic subtext as readily perceived to be inimical by Klara as it would have been by Goethe's Gretchen, is sublime, and even Nathanael recognizes intermittently that its horrible voice is not his. Freud's Enlightenment analysis of this story on the other hand takes it as given that the horrible voice is Nathanael's own, the expression of the Nachtr?glichkeit that at once represses, displaces, and discloses an earlier trauma. Hence even Freud belongs within the tradition that sub 26. E. T. A. Hoffmann, Spukgeschichte und M?rchen (M?nchen: Goldmann, n. d.) 125.</page><page sequence="13">THE POSSESSION OF THE SUBLIME 199 jectivizes the mutuality of possession.27 In the 1923 study, "A Neurosis of Demoniacal Possession, " Freud begins by conceding a probable mea sure of historical bias in his and his contemporaries' spontaneous attri bution to "organic diseases" of those neuroses that were in other eras considered "demonological."28 He goes on unhesitatingly to affirm, however, the important new ground on which his science stands: "In one respect only do we not subscribe to the explanation of these phe nomena current in medieval times: we have abandoned the projection of them into the outer world, attributing their origin instead to the inner life of the patient in whom they manifest themselves" (Freud 91). Passing over the unavoidable irony in this context of the word "patient" (Patient), we may wonder whether or in what sense one may be disqualified to be a judge of "possession" by the denial that it does or can occur. The superstitious object of Enlightenment worship is, again, the autonomous self, and Freud despite his radical documentation of the self's inner division nevertheless remains sufficiently a scientific positivist never to doubt the division between mind and environment. Freud of course is scarcely alone in denying authentic existence to the structure of exchange we are calling the sublime. His outlook has been inherited by the best students of the literary genre that has come to be called "the fantastic." The main premise of Tzvetan Todorov's influential book, The Fantastic, is that the supernatural can only appear against the backdrop of the natural. It is experienced only "by a person who knows only the laws of nature," and stands out in contrast with "a world which is indeed our world, the one we know, a world without devils, syl phides, or vampires. . . ."29 The genres of the uncanny (?trange), the fantastic, and the marvellous all reflect this same contrast, but whereas 27- It is not always so with Freud. As Hertz points out, summarizing the argument of Paul Roazen, Freud refused to analyze Victor Tausk just prior to writing "The Uncanny" because he was afraid Tausk "would be likely to imagine that ideas he had picked up in his hours with Freud were actually his own" ("Freud and the Sandman" 315). Here Freud makes Tausk Hoffmann's Nathanael, a victim of possession, while casting himself in the role of the Freudian Nathanael, whose voice is always self-possessed. As plagiarist, Tausk would experience the Longinian sublime, the belief that one has uttered what one hears, while the more normative Freudian neurotic experiences the uncanny, the belief that someone else has uttered what one has said oneself. 28.

FRY the uncanny is always resolved naturalistically and the marvellous is left permanently unexplained, the fantastic is ambiguously either the former or the latter, leaving the reader in a state of "hesitation" which is, indeed, the semiotic discontinuity of the sublime.30 We recognize, then, that in discussing the sublime we have in mind the same, or much the same, phenomenon as Todorov's fantastic, and that in his work we will find the structure of our problem well delineated; yet from our perspective his premise seems breathtakingly unwary. Did Freud's Seventeenth Century "demoniacal possession" subject Christoph Haitzmann, in whose world the existence of devils was taken for granted, find the appearance of a devil to him any the less startling? And could we not suppose even Haitzmann briefly to have wondered, furthermore, whether he might merely be "seeing things"? Nothing but the supersti tion of Enlightenment can prevent analysis from recognizing that in the "hestitation" with which the sublime is encountered one might as readily toy with and reject a natural explanation as the other way around. It is the natural explanation in any case, to complete the irony, that corre sponds to and encourages the romantic illusion of the autonomous self. The interest of the "Demoniacal Possession" case for Freud was that the hapless Haitzmann was as much bedevilled by purportedly benign spirits after the exorcism was accomplished than he had been hitherto by the Devil, thus perfectly illustrating the hypothesis that the father is split by ambivalence into good and bad proxies?whose common affin ity with their prototype however makes them much less antithetical than we might expect them to be. In this insight Freud is in some ways anticipated by Robert Louis Stevenson, whose Dr. Jekyll only appears to be the opposite of Mr. Hyde and proves in the end to have distilled Mr. Hyde out of his own capacity for evil. One of the choicest post modern apperceptions, on the other hand, carrying one well beyond the question whether doubles are or are not self-projections, entails the notion that there must be persons who see doubles where there are none, who train their "eye for resemblances" (Aristotle's expression for the gift of making metaphors) on a world irreducibly comprised of differ ence. This is the thesis of Vladimir Nabokov's novel, Despair, and of Rainer Werner Fassbinder's brilliant film adaptation of it. It is a final and, it seems to me, finally shrewd turn of Enlightenment thinking that the experience of illusion is not a temporarily unresolvable mise en ab?me but is itself quite simply illusory. On this view, the other is irreducibly other and in that sense truly "alien." Perhaps it is within this 30.

On the present occasion, however, we are concerned to investigate the givenness of the double, of the semblable which whether it is "there" or not is registered affectively, registered in the analytic of the sublime, in the romantic tradition, and in the scientific Enlightenment as a simulacrum of, ultimately even as an invention of, the self. It is in such visions as these that demons appear as familiars. IV We can now attempt to show what happens to the sublime structure of exchange in the literary era that begins with Milton by interpreting a sonnet of Keats in such a way that the liaison first of Milton and then of Keats, respectively, with Satanic influence will reveal why Burke, midway between the two, introduced the psychology of "fear" into the theory of the sublime. Here is the sonnet: On First Looking Into Chapman's Homer Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold, And many goodly states and kingdoms seen; Round many western islands have I been Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold. Oft of one wide expanse had I been told That deep-brow'd Homer ruled as his demesne; Yet never did I breathe its pure serene Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold: Then felt I like some watcher of the skies When a new planet swims into his ken; Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes He star'd at the Pacific?and all his men Look'd at each other with a wild surmise? Silent, upon a peak in Darien.31 In this poem, Keats notoriously supposes that it was Cortez, not Balboa, who first stood silent on a peak in Darien, Panama, and looked out upon the Pacific. We think we know why Keats made this mistake. In Robertson's History of America, his undoubted source, Cortez is so much more prominent than Balboa that we can feel anyone would have been likely to make Keats's mistake, especially when writing feverishly 31.

FRY at dawn after a night of declaiming the Odyssey aloud. But it is hard to leave the matter there. This mistake discloses a double?a series of doubles?of the kind we have recurrently discussed, partly similar and partly contrastive. The substitution of the explorer Cortez for the ex plorer Balboa sets one thinking about the awkwardness of the title: the poet Chapman for the poet Homer, Chapman superimposed over Ho mer as his translator. Chapman's Homer has been much admired in our century by Ezra Pound among others, and I suspect many of the com mentators on this sonnet of having accepted the Poundian assessment uncritically; for it must be said that Chapman's style, while clean and brisk, is also ungainly and prosaic.32 It is not "loud and bold"; but that expression is a perfect epithet for the style of one who has since fre quently been admired for his "organ tones," and this is just one way of suggesting that at bottom Keats is not thinking about Chapman or Homer but about Milton. The doublet Homer versus Chapman sets two other doublets in place: antiquity versus Renaissance and Mediterranean world versus worlds to the west. The octave is certainly made up for the most part of the imagery and atmosphere of the Odyssey, and Keats even borrows one or two of Chapman's epithets. We could pass the interesting "western islands" in tranquillity were it not for what follows. These are at least in part the islands west of the Greek mainland, including Ithaca. It is only later that one wonders, why specifically "western"??thinking not only of the West Indies via the exploration theme33 but also, after all, of England, which mythologically-oriented bards like Keats likewise hold in fealty to Apollo. But what really carries us from the octave to the sestet (the natural doublets of the Petrarchan sonnet: similar but different), entering a new and unexpected realm, is the expression "wide expanse." Until this point in Keats's literary travels poets have been made to preside over islands and lands of riches, the ports of call in Homer's world and in Robertson's History. The new poet, however, allegedly Chapman's Homer, rules a "wide expanse," conceivably a vast island or continental tract but much more plausibly an expanse of ocean34?or even, considering the "pure serene," the deep vault of the 32. For discussions that stress Cowden Clarke's report of Keats's enthusiasm for Chap man, see John Middleton Murry, The Mystery of Keats (London: Peter Nevill, 1949) 98 99, and Bernice Siote, "Of Chapman's Homer and Other Books" CE 23 {1961-62): 257. 33.

By the sestet in any case the wide expanse has definitely become first celestial, then oceanic. In other words, then, the new poet surrounds all the others, dwarfs them to the status of gems on his own surface; and whereas their worlds were worldly?wealthy, luxuriant, and sublunary?this poet's world encompasses the entire cosmos. Accordingly, the sestet takes us beyond Olympus, though it does return us to a mountaintop in the end. Why does reading Homer make Keats feel so little Greek and so much like a man of the Renaissance, at least the contemporary of Chapman if not more recent, armed with a telescope and daring to undertake a distant exploration that imitates that of Dante's Ulysses and provincializes Homer's westernmost horizon, the Gates of Hercules at Gibraltar? We know that lines 9-10 are inspired in part by an account of Herschel's abovementioned discovery of Uranus in 1781,35 but for a poetic image of swimming in space for the purpose of planetary discovery Keats's memory would carry him back to the Renaissance. He would recall the poet whose anti-hero, Satan, "swims or sinks" toward the newly-created Earth and first sees its circumam bient universe, "this pendant world, in bigness as a star" resembling the star that resembles his own shield, "whose Orb / Through Optic Glass the Tuscan Artist views / At Ev'ning from the top of Fesole, I Or in Valdarno, to descry new lands" (Paradise Lost 11.950, 1052; 1.287-90).^ Because Galileo challenged orthodox cosmology Milton conceives him in the passage just quoted as a double of Satan,37 both watcher and strong swimmer, Herschel and stout Cortez. Milton's Galileo, an "art ist," oddly, and thus a type of himself, is placed alternately on the hilltop of Fiesole and in the valley of the Arno below?in Florence, that is, the earthly type of Dante's Hell, as Milton well knew and as Keats may have known only by report, as we cannot prove that he read Cary's Dante before 1818. Suppose then that in keeping Milton in the back ground of his sonnet?with whatever degree of awareness?Keats en visioned a scene that is the mirror opposite of the tableau stationing Cortez and his men on the peak. Galileo on the hill is like Cortez, but in Valdarno he is damned for his heretical boldness, and thus by a M?bius Strip effect that is frequent in Milton he enters the infernal scene to which the view through his telescope has been compared and becomes one of those hitherto silent beings who respond to Satan when "on the 35- See John Keats: Selected Poems and Letters, ed.

FRY Beach / Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call'd / His Legions, Angel Forms who lay intrans'd" (i.299-301). Via the telescope, we move to Satan's discovery of our planet. Via the telescope placed either on a mountaintop or by the sea below we move from Cortez and his silent men to Satan and his entranced legions. But why Hell, and why is Satan the focus? Because Keats, I would suggest, whose Spenserian imitations prior to this, his first successful poem, have lingered in the foothills of Milton's genius, has already noticed the audacity of Milton's own struggle for primacy in the Invo cation to Book Three, to which Keats's "pure serene" should guide us. In that place Milton describes the gutta serena or unchanged physical appearance of his eyes in blindness,38 his Homeric handicap. For Keats this passage would be Milton's Chapman's Homer: So thick a drop serene hath quencht thir Orbs, Or dim suffusion veil'd. Yet not the more Cease I to wander where the Muses haunt Clear Spring, or shady Grove, or Sunny Hill, Smit with the love of sacred Song; but chief Thee Sion and the flow'ry brooks beneath That wash thy hallow'd feet, and warbling flow, Nightly I visit: nor sometime forget Those other two equall'd with me in Fate, So were I equall'd with them in renown, Blind Thamyris and blind Maonides. (in. 25-3 5) Maonides is Homer and Thamyris is the bard mentioned in the Iliad who was blinded for challenging the Muses and who was said by Plutarch to have been the author of a poem about the battle between the Titans and the Olympians. Smit with the love of sacred song, Keats's Milton, on a hilltop, near water, and in a valley like Galileo, wants to emulate Homer, if not surpass him, and he does so by taking his own Satan for his model of rebellion against established authority. Addressing the Holy Light he invokes in this passage, Milton says: "Thee I revisit now with bolder wing, / Escap't the Stygian Pool, though long detain'd / in that obscure sojourn" (in. 13-15). It is impossible not to notice whose flight Milton follows in his difficult ascent, or with whom Keats atop his own Niphates, or Pisgah, or Darien, daringly identifies himself. 38.

The substitution of Homer for Milton is not fully worked through?as always, the double is not perfect?and is itself the sign of an even deeper feeling that is ironically confirmed by the sonnet. Stand ing on the beach and viewing the wide expanse from which his own self-conception has emerged, Keats feels like the father of lies, as Chris tians call Satan and as both Plato and Aristotle called Homer. The difference between the sublime of Milton and the sublime of Keats is clear enough. Milton's identification with Satan is after all only a bravura performance, at once breathtakingly heretical and superbly calculated rhetorically, and fairly warrants speculation about "posses sion" only from the standpoint of romantic misreading. Having already invoked divine aid from the site of Moses's inspiration in Book i ("I thence / Invoke thy aid" 12-13) and having then predated the author of Genesis by promising "Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhyme" (16; italics mine: the word "Prose" makes it impossible to overlook the gibe at the derivative and incomplete status of Genesis), Milton scarcely need worry about the influence of Satan, whose hectoring "We know no time when we were not as now" (vi.859) merely completes the romantic delusion effected by Milton's influence on him. In seeing themselves, not Milton, in Milton's Satan, the romantic poets were correct. It was they who believed themselves to be autonomous, knowing no time when they were not as now, at just those moments when Milton's Satan usurped their place in their own poems, as in the sublime moment when Keats stares at the "demesne" he has perforce, as an explorer, claimed for his own. In the interruption that creates an interesting asyndetic link between "Pacific" and "silent" (making the sea an extension of the silence), even Milton's Lycidas (line 153) comes flooding in with its heretical word "surmise." Keats's wild surmise, floundering without the certitude of rejection in Milton's "false surmise," is what Todorov calls "hesitation" and Burke called "fear." V It has become a tradition to end discussions of the sublime with a bow to Wordsworth's great interruptive apostrophe to Imagination in The Prelude, Book 6.39 Thomas Weiskel reads this passage intricately, while Samuel Holt Monk does little more than quote it as a fitting 0 altitudo? 39- See Samuel Holt Monk, The Sublime: A Study of Critical Theories in xvm-Century England (1935; Ann Arbor: U of Michigan P, i960) 231-32, and Weiskel, The Romantic Sublime 195-204.</page><page sequence="20">206 PAUL H. FRY and on this occassion I shall emulate the earlier scholar, having arranged the present essay from the outset as much to identify, to stage the identification of, Wordsworth's "Imagination" as to do anything else. Left temporarily without their guide, Wordsworth and his fellow Alpine traveller negotiating the Simpl?n Pass cross the summit unawares and are soon told that they are descending rather than climbing. Pre mature finitude thus disappoints the climbers' expectation of the "im measurable" in nature (Wordsworth tries to recover it at line 624), and the result is the central exhibit in English romanticism of what Weiskel calls "semiotic discontinuity." The travellers will descend, as Weiskel emphasizes, through an apocalyptic ravine, the Gorge of Gondo, so ominous in its life-threatening grandeur that Weiskel reads the preceding Imagination apostrophe as a postponement and displacement of anxiety from its source in the vertigo of nature. I am inclined similarly but with a different emphasis to read the apostrophe as a visitation ofthat which will preordain the mood of the poet's descent, which will indeed per meate everything, because it is never channeled in being securely iden tified. I quote the passage once more in full: Imagination?here the Power so called Through sad incompetence of human speech, That awful Power rose from the mind's abyss Like an unfathered vapour that enwraps, At once^ some lonely traveller. I was lost; Halted without an effort to break through; But to my conscious soul I now can say? "I recognize thy glory:" in such strength Of usurpation, when the light of sense Goes out, but with a flash that has revealed The invisible world, doth greatness make abode, There harbours whether we be young or old. Our destiny, our being's heart and home, Is with infinitude, and only there; With hope it is, hope that can never die, Effort, and expectation, and desire, And something evermore about to be. Under such banners militant, the soul Seeks for no trophies, struggles for no spoils That may attest her prowess, blest in thoughts That are their own perfection and reward, Strong in herself and in beatitude That hides her, like the mighty flood of Nile</page><page sequence="21">THE POSSESSION OF THE SUBLIME 207 Poured from his fount of Abyssinian clouds To fertilise the whole Egyptian plain. (1850 ed. 592-616)40 Wordsworth's apostrophe dramatizes the entire dialectic of mutual possession that obtains both in the individual sublime experience and in the history of the sublime as a concept from Milton to the romantic period. Influence moves from without to within, and the resulting pro claimed autonomy of inwardness reifies the mind and alienates it once again, so that the poet finds himself addressing his very self as a mys terious and by no means initially friendly stranger. Confronting his own soul, "halted" like a traveller at a gravestone, he hesitates and relin quishes power, acknowledging a "usurpation" that he can only celebrate by supposing that against all appearances it is untainted and pure. The struggle for power is over, he says, and in modest retirement he can enjoy the bliss of infinitude he imagines?as though that imagining were not in itself an inherited gift, a prophetic voice that in entering the inevitable rivalry of song becomes a public and therefore alienable pos session. Today the devil is still a peasant bogey. We can safely assume that the Bolivian tin-miners of the sociologist I mentioned earlier assign a great many more colorful misfortunes to the devil, who is their familiar, than commodity fetishism merely. It is the sociologist, not the miners, who relegates the demonic to a single function in a sphere that is securely separated from his own consciousness, supposing with Freud and To dorov that reality is a matter of existing material conditions. On reflec tion, though, it is he far more than his informants who is still squarely within the romantic tradition that has been misleadingly transumed as the scientific outlook in the present century. The evil of possession possesses him. Yale University 40. Most commentators prefer the version of this passage that appears in the 1805 edition of The Prelude, and in balance it is indeed perhaps preferable; but I have quoted here from the 1850 edition (in William Wordsworth: Selected Poems and Prefaces, ed. Jack Stillinger [Cambridge, MA: Riverside, 1965]) because of its emphasis on the failure of signification?"through sad incompetence of human speech."</page></plain_text>
