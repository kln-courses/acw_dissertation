<plain_text><page sequence="1">History of Sociology* Panos D. Bardis Toledo University, Toledo, Ohio, USA [Why do too many professors and students consider sociology a Mickey Mouse subject? Part of the answer is found in the almost 100 textbooks in introductory sociology that I have examined, as well as in the more than 400 professional reviews of these volumes that I have scrutinized very carefully. These textbooks do not really deal with a changing world. Instead, they constantly emphasize foolish fads, inane ephemerals, and tasteless trivia. The fascinating triad of past-present-future is thus truncated mercilessly. Another weakness is stylistic. Indeed, these tomes are replete with what I call "gobbledygook, terminological gymnastics, linguistic acrobatics, and transmogrifica- tion of the English language." This partly explains why The American Sociologist and ASA Footnotes have occasionally complained that statesmen, union leaders, business executives, and the like do not read sociological journals, although they do consult periodicals in economics, political science, and so forth. Then, these books pretend to stress master theories, which, in sociology, are still nonexistent. Such nonexistence is indicated by the fact that "established" theories and techniques are often "debunked" in articles published in sociological journals. Moreover, even basic issues are still being debated most amusingly. As late as April 1975, for instance, ASA Footnotes contained an altercation between two experts in methodology who could not agree even on fundamental points (p. 2). It was as if a respected mathematician were howling at another equally respected mathemat- ician: "Sir, the value of e is not 2.71828; it is 5.32601." Much more unfortunate is the tendency to emphasize emotional radicalism at the expense of objective thinking. As for unpopular issues, they are avoided systematically. Even the officers of the American Sociological Association are guilty of such shenanigans. In 1975, for example, they expressed some interest in amnesty for draft offenders, but have never uttered a single word against Uganda's bloody and deranged dictator or the heinous crimes committed by the Khmer Rouge. Similarly, the typical sociologist's heart bleeds for the criminal, although it remains apathetic when it comes to the helpless victim. As for affirmative action and quotas, the American Sociological Association has become a supporter of reverse discrimination, anti-intellectual racism, and medieval mediocrity, which have led to hilarious anec- dotes, such as the following: "An illiterate minority member signed a document with two crosses. When he was asked the reason, he explained proudly and triumphantly: 'The first cross is for my name and the second for my Ph.D.!' "Who could blame Dr. Edgar Borgatta, a brilliant and internationally known author-editor- educator, who wrote the following in the April 1975 issue of ASA Footnotes: "where is the ASA, which passes so many moral resolutions on all types of topics? . . . ASA policy is racist, and its leadership seems highly supportive of racism. The ASA program of Graduate Fellowships for Minority Students has explicit eligibility requirements. . . . This does exclude persons from India, Turkey, and Siberia. . . . Somehow, if the ASA does it, and the HEW provides the money, it is not supposed to be racism. As a small protest, I resigned my voting membership" (p. 6). Equally ridiculous is the sociological enthusiasm about campus protesters. As we all know, ° Reprinted from Society and Culture , 1976. 213</page><page sequence="2">214 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOR AUTUMN 1976 a common assumption has been that the leftist activists were emotionally and intellectually superior. Even when they displayed anxiety and impulsiveness - traits that are usually indicative of instability - too many sociologists praised such charac- teristics without searching for empirical evidence. The conclusion concerning the leftists' intellectual superiority was based on their own "modest" statements about their grades. Nevertheless, when Larry Kerpelman's major empirical study, Activists and Nonactivists (Behavioral Publications), appeared in 1972, it was shown that academic records did not support the protesters' egomaniacal claims! But did the sociologists revise their opinions? Silly question! Of course, as John Kenneth Galbraith has stated, campus unrest has resulted in lower academic standards (Time, June 23, 1975, p. 60). But why should sociologists care, since such decline means greater popularity for their Mickey Mouse subject, as the hordes of obtuse, dunderheaded, and torpid troglodytes are invading academia? Then, there is the matter of methodology, which absolutely all introductory texts neglect. In fact, even those few that deal with some tests, merely and briefly, tell the student about these techniques without showing him how they are performed. Accordingly, no reader could ever learn from these texts how to employ even a simple Pearson r test. Naturally, the pretentious sociologists assert that college students would not understand genuine sociology, which is a sublimely complex, scientific, and marvelous field! Therefore, we must simplify it until it sounds like barbershop philosophy! Poor sociologists! They forget that the students to whom they preach so condescendingly (but, perhaps, the low level of presentation is merely due to the typical sociology instructor's limited knowledge, which consists primarily of vacuous jargon and jejune generalizations exclusively about his own present-day society) are also taking introductory astronomy, biology, mathematics, and the like, which have not been naively simplified. They further forget that our students are not so stupid as most sociologists seem to think they are. At any rate, even methods and statistics courses offered by sociology departments are practically useless. Instructors disdainfully defend themselves by asserting that they do not wish to teach simple and elementary "cookbook statistics." In reality, however, that is all the statistics that the ordinary sociologist knows (anything more advanced is ghostwrit- ten for him!). As for formula derivation, virtually no sociologist is familiar with sufficient mathematics to deal with this area - even "doctoral" courses exclude this topic. And how about the philosophy of research techniques? Forget it! Most sociologists are so aphilosophical, ahistorical, and temporocentric that they neglect, and even ridicule, this level of knowledge and instruction. "Relevance" is another sociological malady. An instructor in an advanced course, which dealt with only four (!) concepts, has even suggested anarchical freedom of self-expression, show-and-tell items, fencing bouts, mobiles, collages, and choreographic acrobatics to facilitate "quick and painless absorption of the meanings of the four concepts" (The American Sociologist , November 1972, p. 21)!!! Oh Relevance! Oh Speed! Oh Painlessness and Jubilation! I can easily visualize those Lilliputian Leonardos revealing their untraumatized and blithe little psyches, and then gyrating frenetically like ecstatic dervishes in a weirdly hedonistic universe! Can you imagine an astronomy professor encouraging sociology majors in his class to assimilate his subject by means of analogous shenanigans? The Ptolemaic system, for example, could be choreographed as a gynecocratic family - if, of course, the dense dancers had ever heard of Johann Bachofen and Robert Briffault - with a coed acting as Mother Earth in the midst of pirouetting starlets. Then, all of a sudden, a Copernican male chauvinist calling himself Ra or Sir Henry Maine could spring up, dethrone Mother Earth, and force her to swirl submissively around his blazing, radiating majesty! Now, some supercilious sociologists will assert that we</page><page sequence="3">HISTORY OF SOCIOLOGY 215 need a variety of pedagogical approaches. I agree. In fact, I believe that our educational system should aim at the creation of citizens who constitute a brilliant constellation of multicolored jewels and sparkling gems, instead of a sack of dull and uniform ball bearings. But there is a great difference between academic freedom and pedagogical anarchy! One of the most unscientific chapters in introductory sociology texts is that on crime. Its emphasis usually is on "conflict criminology." Now the uninitiated (fortunate souls!) may not know that this is man's greatest scientific discovery! In fact, William Chambliss (1973) has hailed this bit of sociological idiocy as a spectacular achievement, a brilliant revolution, and a Galilean paradigm in the Western world!!! For instance, in an effort to brainwash thousands of ill-starred sociology students, it has been arrogantly and subjectively asserted that, for the same offenses, lower class criminals are punished much more severely. Since I have never seen any evidence supporting the bleeding hearts' assertion, for years I have been howling at my innocent colleagues: "Any empirical evidence?" And, for years, they have been shouting shrilly: "We don't need any evidence. We know it's true!" At last, T. Chiricos and P. Waldo published, in the December 1975 issue of the American Sociological Review , the first and only scientific study dealing with this hypothesis. As I had predicted, the "conflict criminologists" have been wrong! But, dear reader, if you expect sociologists to revise their vapid views, you will be disappointed. Incidentally, biased criminologists always attack the "thieves" and "exploiters" in the business world, but never mention the employees' offenses, which cost business $20.3 billion in 1974 and $23.6 billion in 1975. And guess who ultimately has to pay for such crimes! Finally, since almost all sociologists are rather ahistorical, absolutely all introduc- tory texts ignore the sociohistorical approach. I will not even attempt to defend the vast value of this viewpoint, which I accept axiomatically. Let me only state two things. First, there is no scientific sociology without some emphasis on the sociohistorical approach. Genuine sociology stresses both past and present and then tries to predict something about the future. Second, too many of the ideas which we naively consider modern are centuries, and even millennia, old. Below are a few examples: 1. Democritus: atomic theory. 2. Aristophanes: modern city plans. 3. Plato: Francis Bacon's "idols of the theatre," Grotius's international law, Rousseau's " noble sauvage Comte's theocratic stage, Carlyle's great-man theory of history, Bagehot's "yoke of custom," Durkheim's "solidarité mécanique" Einstein's theory of relativity, Cooley's "primary group," 20th century probability, Toynbee's cyclical evolutionism, etc. 4. Hero: steam engine. 5. Lope de Vega: Pavlov's "conditioned reflex." 6. Shakespeare: Kretschmer's types, Sheldon's constitutional types, etc. In brief, introductory sociology textbooks are characterized by countless weak- nesses, one of them being a lack of emphasis on the sociohistorical approach. Part of this serious problem may be solved by including, early in the text, a chapter on the history of sociology. This chapter may be something like the one presented below.] (P.S. The August 1976 issue of ASA Footnotes contains some new data concerning the American Sociological Association's racist, dictatorial, and anti-intellectual policies (pp. 7-8). It also includes the following statement: "No wonder sociology is flounder-</page><page sequence="4">216 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOR AUTUMN 1976 ing, its image nationwide deteriorating and its membership and market position eroding, even as adjacent disciplines such as psychology - less lunatically out of touch with reality - are booming" (p. 8). As for the Lee-Coleman affair (pp. 7,9), it has become a classic example of academic decline involving self-important, uninspired, and undiscerning "leaders" who, with amusing and self-congratulatory cuteness, like to pontificate pompously and pointlessly.) * * * "There is no new thing under the sun.

Middle Ages XII. Modern Times One of the most important branches of sociology is the history of social thought. The importance of this field is due to many reasons, including the following two: first, the study of the origins, antecedents, and development of sociology gives us some insight into the concepts of change and continuity, experimentation with ideas, and creative thinking. Second, such study ulti- mately leads to modern sociological theory and its better appreciation and understanding. Needless to add, since theory is a vital part of every science, without it there can be no scientific sociology.</page><page sequence="5">HISTORY OF SOCIOLOGY 217 Here, therefore, a brief outline of the history of sociology, from ancient times to the present, will be given. I. Japan Japanese social thought and social institutions had their origin in ancient religion and mythology.1 Shintoism (from the Japanese Shinto , "ways of the spirits") is Japan's oldest and most important religion. In reality, however, Shintoism is not a genuine religion, since it lacks a sacred book, doctrines, and a moral code. The absence of such a code is explained by the belief that the Japanese, having descended from the kami (gods), are perfect. Therefore, unlike the Chinese and Westerners, they need no ethical codes. This also means that the concepts of social change and social reform are unimportant. Shintoism thus stresses, in the simplest possible fashion, nature and ancestor worship. Since nature is personified, there are gods for everything (mountains, rivers, food, kitchens, etc.). Ancestor worship, on the other hand, refers to the sacredness of the emperor and one's forefathers, namely, the state and the family. This marriage between religion and the state is indicated by the fact that the first Shinto temple was the Imperial Palace itself. Later on, when Amaterasu's separate temple was built at Ise, which is Japan's oldest and most venerated shrine, it was an imperial princess that watched over its three sacred treasures. These were the mirror, representing the sun, the curved jewel, and the sword, which became the "Three Imperial Regalia," and "which even today are the symbols of imperial authority."2 The 10 sects of Shintoism, which stressed ceremonial purity and included only a vague idea about the afterlife, were united by a single precept: "Follow the impulse of your nature and obey your Emperor." The founder of this religion was Amaterasu ("The Heaven-shining-great- deity"), the goddess of the sun or light, now called Tensho-daijin. Amaterasu sent her grandson, Ninigi, to be Japan's first ruler. His own great-grandson, Jimmu-tenno, became the country's first emperor and the imperial dynasty's founder. This explains the monarch's divine nature and tremendous power. According to two historians, the first emperor "did not ascend the throne in 660 B.C., but Japan's imperial institution is still the world's oldest hereditary office. It has been passed down through the members of one family, seemingly without any break through adoption or usurpation since archaic times. Religious beliefs have helped to perpetuate it."3 In the fifth century A.D., Confucianism invaded Japan, but few of its ideas were incorporated into Shintoism. Nevertheless, it greatly influenced the samurai (Japanese samurau , to guard), the aristocratic caste of warriors that was formed in the 12th century A.D. Many samurai became noted statesmen and members of the imperial guard. Their main ideals were absolute loyalty and self-sacrifice, which were achieved through strict moral, mental, and physical training. In 1878, the Chinese term shizoku was substituted for samurai. Buddhism was introduced in 552 A.D. Being much more profound and philosophical than Shintoism, it gradually supplanted the national religion of Japan. But the two faiths were later combined into a fairly unified system, Ryobu Shinto . Finally, in 1868, Shintoism won over the imported Confucianism and Buddhism, thus becoming the only state religion. It is not surprising, then, that the Japanese family has also been dominated by the ideals of obedience, filial piety, solidarity, and continuity. Its patriarchal</page><page sequence="6">218 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOR AUTUMN 1976 nature gave the father absolute power and made sons more important than daughters. The wife has been confined to the home, while the husband, in more recent times, has sought the companionship of the cultivated geisha (gei, art; sha , person). Similarly, society as a whole has been regimented and individualism curtailed. The famous Suiko Code , for instance, stressed the family and the state at the expense of the individual and imposed social continuity through religious ceremonies. During the early 20th century, sociology of a philosophical nature developed under the influence of French and German scholars. The Japanese Sociological Society was founded in 1925, its official organ being Shakaigaku Hyoron ( Japanese Sociological Review ). It is the second largest sociological organiza- tion in the world - after the American Sociological Association. The fields emphasized most are sociological theory and family sociology. Methodology, however, is still poor and Japanese sociology remains sociophilosophical. II. China Ralf Dahrendorf ( Class and Class Conflict in Industrial Society , 1959) and other modern conflict theorists have seen perpetual disintegration and change in every society, and the forces of conflict and dissension in every social element. The philosophical seeds of this important theory may be found in the ancient Chinese concepts of Yang and Yin ý Yang and Yin These concepts symbolize countless opposites, including the following: Yang Heaven Good Light Energy Life Odd number Male Love Joy Reward Yin Earth Evil Darkness Inertia Death Even number Female Hate Sorrow Punishment Forces such as these are both opposed and united, separate and compie-</page><page sequence="7">HISTORY OF SOCIOLOGY 219 mentary, the goal of their eternal interaction being universal harmony. This is why the Yang-Yin circle, or creation principle, is bisected not by a diameter but by a sigmoid line which stands for a dynamic tendency. Thus, each half includes part of the other, which means that everything contains the seeds of its opposite (cf. Heraclitus, Hegel, Marx). The sigmoid line, then, represents change, metamorphosis, and continuity, while the vertical axis passing through the center is the "unvarying mean" and symbolizes absence of motion or impulse of any sort - something like the center of the Wheel of Transformations in Hindu philosophy. Another important Chinese contribution is Confucianism , which is known as Ju Chiao (Teaching of the Learned) and Ju Chia (School of the Learned).5 Confucius (551-479 B.C.), the founder of this system, was not an original thinker but a preserver and synthesizer of the past. This is partly indicated by his Analects, which means selections of literary works. His traditionalism and ritualism are further seen in Li Chi, or Book of Rites, a collection of Confucian writings which still remains one of the most influential manuals of conduct. Confucius stressed social organization on the basis of the family as the smallest unit, for which he advocated self-sufficiency, obedience, and filial piety. To him this basic social institution was so important that, when his mother died, he isolated himself for 27 months! He was against militarism, and two of his cardinal principles were the chung yung (golden mean or central harmony) and the silver rule: "Do not unto others what you would not they should do unto you," which is the same as the golden rule stated negatively, that is: "whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them" (Matthew 7:12). Taoism, perhaps founded by Lao Tzu in the sixth century B.C., was a religious and philosophical system that emphasized nature worship.6 Indeed, Tao means the Way, that is, nature, spontaneity, and simplicity, the solution to social problems being "back to nature." Such nature worship explains why paintings influenced by this system glorify nature in all her majesty, while human scenes are virtually imperceptible. Taoism also carried individu- alism to almost anarchical extremes and condemned selfishness, pride, and private property. Mo Ti (Motse or Mo Tzu), however, who flourished in the sixth century B.C., ridiculed Lao Tzu's cry, "back to nature," and the Confucian stress on ritualism. Instead, he preached universal love and utilitarianism - the Universal Good coincides with the useful. Unlike modern conflict theorists, he regarded conflict as pathological and spoke of li, namely, the promotion of general welfare through peace, increased economic production, etc. Social institutions he regarded as a result of constant efforts to satisfy human needs. Mencius (372-289 B.C.) was a follower of Confucius who, in his Book of Mencius, improved on his master's ideas. He was a humanist who considered man's nature basically good and a pacifist who accused generals of being criminals.7 Han Fei (third century B.C.) may be regarded as one of the world's first fascists. A legalistic, authoritarian, and totalitarian thinker, he believed in objective laws as the highest authority. In fact, to him laws were much more important than love. His interesting theory of social evolution postulated three stages: first, man controls disease and animals; second, man conquers nature; and third, man solves social problems. In modern times, Sun Yat-sen (1866-1925), a revolutionary leader and statesman who founded the Republic of China in 1911, formulated three</page><page sequence="8">220 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOR AUTUMN 1976 famous principles. These, as Sun Yat-sen himself admitted, are similar to Abraham Lincoln's idea of government of the people, by the people, and for the people. The first of these principles is min ts 'u or nationalism; the second, min ch'uan or democracy; and the third, min sheng or livelihood. On September 21, 1949, Mao Tse-tung, a communist leader, and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference proclaimed the People's Republic of China. As a result, four communist thinkers and leaders have been practically deified: Marx, Engles, Lenin, and Stalin. III. India Indian social thought8 began with two national epic poems written in Sanskrit, the older Ramayana , consisting of 50,000 lines and attributed to Valmiki, and the later Mahabharata. The Mahabharata consists of 220,000 lines, thus being the longest epic ever written, and is attributed to Vyasa, the Homer of India. Its sixth book contains a well-known masterpiece, the Bhagavad Gita , which is a poem dealing with theistic religion. Brahmanism , an early form of Hinduism , was based on the concept of the Hindu Trimurti (Trinity), which included three major divinities. The original and most important of these was Brahma the Creator, the other two being Vishnu the Preserver and Siva the Destroyer. The earliest sacred books of Brahmanism, which seem to be the oldest such books in the world, were the four Vedic Hymns. The first of these was the famous Rig Veda (rig, hymn; veda , knowledge), consisting of 1,028 hymns that deal with nature worship and polytheism. Unlike these poetic works, later Brahmanist writings were in prose. These were the Brahmanas , which appeared when the Brahmans were sufficiently powerful to impose the caste system on India, and the Upanishads. This last, a theological and philosophical work, was Brahmanism's final and highest expression.9 The system's leaders were the Brahmans (Worshippers), a priestly caste that had its origin in the ministers, priests, and bards attached to the royal household, and which still remains India's highest caste. This form of social stratification appears to have been based on the Rig Veda and includes thousands of castes. The main ones, however, are four: Brahmans, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Sudras . Buddhism was founded by Gautama Siddhartha (563-483 B.C.), later called Buddha (Enlightened).10 When he was 29 years old, Gautama renounced the world after taking a last look at his wife and child as they lay asleep - this is known as the "Great Renunciation." The "Great Struggle" refers to the six years that he spent in the jungle, leading an ascetic life. It was at the end of this period that, under the Bo-tree (a banyan tree), he attained Buddhahood. Buddhism's supreme goal is nirvana, a state of absolute blessed- ness, characterized by release from the cycle of reincarnations and achieved through the extinction of the self. Nirvana presupposes two important princi- ples. The first is that of the Four Noble Truths : There is suffering in the world, suffering has a cause, suffering must cease, and suffering can cease if we know the right way. The second principle states that desire can be eliminated through the Noble Eightfold Path : 1. Knowledge of the Four Noble Truths. 2. Right goals. 3. Right speech. 4. Right conduct. 5. Right means of livelihood. 6. Right endeavor. 7. Right mindfulness. 8. Right meditation. Jainism was also founded in the sixth century B.C. by Vardhamana Mahavira, known as Jina (Conqueror of passions). Jina preached abolition of the caste</page><page sequence="9">HISTORY OF SOCIOLOGY 221 system, austere asceticism, the concept of rebirth (animal sacrifices were thus forbidden, since an animal might contain the soul of a deceased human), and salvation through the Three Jewels: right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct. The belief in the transmigration of souls led to commercial activities and the disapproval of farming, since tilling the land often causes the destruction of animal life. In other words, in this case, an element of what Marx later called superstructure (a religious belief) influenced a compo- nent of the substratum (economy). And this is the opposite of what Marx would expect. Jainismi literature is incredibly vast and covers all arts and sciences - poetry, drama, novel, grammar, logic, mathematics, political science, education, etc. The Manu-Samhita, or Laws of Manu , was written by Manu , a lawgiver who seems to have lived in the third century B.C.11 The code deals with the domestic, religious, moral, social, and other aspects of the life of orthodox Hindus. Manu also mentions three main personality types - thinking, artistic, and active - and discusses four basic social institutions - family, education, government, and religion. In modern times, Mahatma Gandhi (1869-1948) contributed the concept of satyagraha, which he introduced in South Africa in 1894. This was a spectacularly successful application of soul-force based on nonviolence and truth for the sake of solving certain social problems. In other words, this was the doctrine of individual or group passive resistance, which gradually led to the sit-down strike. In 1920, Gandhi used the same idea against the British in the form of nonviolent noncooperation and civil disobedience. The ultimate result was Indian independence on August 15, 1947. Modern sociology12 began in 1917, when the first course was offered at the University of Calcutta. The founding of the Indian Sociological Society occurred in the 1950's, and the first issue of the Sociological Bulletin appeared in 1952. Internationally known Indian sociologists are S. Chandrasekhar, G. Ghurye, G. Hallen, M. Kapadia, R. Mohan, R. Mukerjee, D. Mukerji, R. Saksena, etc. According to Mohan, at the present time, "sociology in India is moving toward synthesis of traditional Indian and modern Western cultural materials as well as an awareness of sociologies developed elsewhere in various models and schools of thought. Indian sociology is a complex of traditional and modern values and systems of thought; a reflection of past and present: a synthesis of East and West." 13 IV. Persia The seeds of modern conflict theory are also found in Persia's Zoroastrian- ism }4 This religion was established by the prophet Zarathustra (Owner of Old Camels) or, as the Greeks called him, Zoroaster (born about 570 B.C.). His race was Spitama, which means white. Zoroastrianism was "a religion which aimed at replacing the pagan gods personifying natural forces and human passions with a universal system based on the unending conflict between good and evil."15 Spitama Zarathustra recognized Ahura Mazdah (Wise Lord) as the creator and supreme deity that symbolized good. Evil was represented by Ahriman, another Persian divinity. Thus, man finds himself between these forces and, having free will, chooses between good and evil. His deeds, which affect his destiny and determine sanctions in the afterworld, diminish evil when they are moral and reinforce the world of light. This concept of good versus evil, which</page><page sequence="10">222 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOR AUTUMN 1976 influences social control, is represented by the term dualism (Latin duo , two). The term appeared for the first time in 1700, in Thomas Hyde's Historia Religionis Veterum Persarum (Chapter IX). The sacred book of Zoroastrianism is the Zend-Avesta (Zend, interpretation; Avesta, text). It is a manual of liturgies, invocations, devotions, etc., and recalls India's Vedic Hymns. Among other things, it contains 10 command- ments and the silver rule. After Alexander the Great reached Persepolis (330 B.C.), Zoroastrianism began to decline. Its only remnants were later found in the provinces, where they were kept alive by the Magi priests (Wise Men). The Wise Men of Bethlehem belonged to this class of religious leaders. Zoroastrianism declined further when the Moslem Arabs invaded Persia (639 A.D.). As a result, today there are only a few Zoroastrian sects in the world, for instance, the Gabars of Iran and the Farsees of India. The latter left Persia in the ninth century A.D. because of the Moslem persecution. Today their interesting churches are known as fire temples, due to the eternal flame that burns on an altar, a flame symbolizing the divine spark found in every human being. In later Zoroastrian times, Mithra, the old Persian god of light, had become an important divinity. In fact, his cult moved to Babylon, where it incorporated many astrological elements, and finally reached Rome in 67 B.C. Mithra, now known as the god of the Invincible Sun, was then adopted in other parts of Europe and thus influenced many major cultures.16 V. Mesopotamia Mesopotamian (Assyrian and Babylonian) social thought was dominated by science, religion, and the Code of Hammurabi.17 This code seems to have influenced both Assyria and the Hebrews' Deuteronomy, which was written about 1,000 years later. Babylon, which means Gate of God, was known as Babel among the ancient Hebrews. This refers to the "babble" and confusion of tongues, since Babylon was a polyglot and cosmopolitan city, which partly explains many of its spectacular achievements. One of the greatest kings of Babylon was Hammurabi (hammu, uncle; rabi, great; 1728-1688 B.C.). He was a military genius, a developer of cities (his plan for Babylon was of the rectangular type), and a promoter of science, art, and literature. His impressive ziggurat (tower) was the same as the biblical Tower of Babel. The canals which he built and his regulation of the economy made Babylon a great and prosperous city. Also remarkable and memorable was the so-called Code of Hammurabi (1690 B.C.), which was found in 1901-1902 by French archeologists in the ancient city of Susa in southern Persia. The code, written on diorite (black stone) and now in the Louvre, is the oldest and only fairly complete ancient legal document. Its main subjects are justice, offenses against property, land tenure, trade and commerce, the family as a social institution, assault, professional services, agriculture, laborers and craftsmen, and slavery. One of the dominant features of the code was what criminologists call lex talionis , that is, the "an eye for an eye" concept. Indeed, mutilations of hands, tongue, eyes, and ears were common and the death penalty was inflicted for 34 crimes, including every form of stealing. Cruel punishments, of course, have been prevalent throughout history. In England, sheep thieves</page><page sequence="11">HISTORY OF SOCIOLOGY 223 were punished by death until 1832 and pickpockets until 1808. So one may still assert that Hammurabi's was one of the greatest ancient codes. Below are a few of its provisions: 1. "If a son has struck his father, they shall cut off his hand" (Section 195). "If the surgeon has made a serious wound in a gentleman with a bronze knife, and has thereby caused the gentleman to die . . . they shall cut off (the surgeon's) hand" (Section 218). Leviticus 24:20 states: "Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again." 2. "If a man . . . lies sexually with his mother, they shall burn both of them" (Section 157). According to Leviticus 20:11: "And the man that lieth with his father's wife . . . both of them shall surely be put to death." 3. "If a man has taken a wife, but has not set down a contract for her, that woman is not (legally) a wife" (Section 128; cf. today's trial marriages). 4. "If a gentleman's wife has had her husband killed on account of another man, they shall impale that woman on a stake" (Section 153). 5. "If a builder has made a house for a man but has not made his work strong, so that the house he made falls down and causes the death of the owner of the house, that builder shall be put to death" (Section 229). 6. "If a man has accused a man and has charged him with manslaughter and then has not proved (it against) him, his accuser shall be put to death" (Section 1). 7. "If a man kidnaps the infant (son) of a (free) man, he shall be put to death" (Section 14). 8. "If a man has broken into a house, they shall put him to death" (Section 21). VI. Hebrews One of the greatest influences on the Western world has been Hebrew social thought. The first Hebrew patriarch was Abram (Exalted Father), who was later called Abraham (Father of Multitude). The founder of the Hebrew nation actually came from Ur, a Chaldean city near the Persian Gulf, together with his father Terah. This was during the Middle Bronze Age, or about 1900 B.C. Abraham, who spoke Sumerian or Accadian, and who was seeking Canaan, the land that God had promised him, may also be considered the founder of three great religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam (Ishmael, his son by Hagar, is regarded as the ancestor of all Arabs). His main ideals were self-sacrifice, virtue, and pacifism. Moreover, the so-called Covenant of Abraham introduced circumcision for the earliest Hebrew patriarch and his descendants. The first truly great Hebrew leader, however, came in the 13th century B.C. That was Moses , son of Amram and Jochebed and brother of Aaron and Miriam, who was born in Egypt. Found as an infant by the pharaoh's daughter and brought up in the court, Moses became a leader, statesman, and, some say, the greatest lawgiver of all time. According to Acts 7:22, "Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds." Such influence by Egypt's culture involved at least five important areas: first, the art of writing; second, architecture, as is indicated by the Tabernacle, the portable sanctuary of the Hebrews; third, Egypt's</page><page sequence="12">224 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOR AUTUMN 1976 moral philosophers, especially Ptah Hotep; fourth, magic, as revealed by the copper (not brass) serpent in Numbers 21:9: "Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived"; and fifth, the solar monotheism of Pharaoh Akhenaton. When he was a young man, Moses defined the problem of slavery and then acted accordingly: he killed an Egyptian taskmaster for striking a Hebrew slave. The result was his people's exodus from Egypt, one of history's most stirring and dramatic liberation movements. The crossing of the Reed (not Red) Sea was immortalized in the sublime Song of Moses and Miriam, which glorifies freedom and monoth- eism: "I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. . . ." (Exodus 15:1). Moses thus unified the Hebrew nation under Yah weh, the God of his monotheistic system. David (Beloved), Saul's successor and second king of the Hebrews (1000-961 B.C.), was the son of Jesse of Bethlehem. Having killed the Philistine giant Goliath, he became a national hero before he was king. As a monarch, the former shepherd was an efficient administrator, competent executive, able diplomat, and brilliant tactician who thus unified his nation. David also made Jerusalem the religious and political capital of all Israelites and introduced an important musical ritual of worship - his psalms and music are legendary. The practice of polygyny, which was common at that time, explains some of David's family problems. The third king, Solomon (961-922 B.C.), was the son of David and Bath-sheba. Nathan the prophet called him Jedidiah (Beloved of Jehovah), but the name Solomon (Peaceable) became more popular because of the king's peaceful reign. Solomon is considered the father of the Hebrew Wisdom Literature, as he composed countless songs and literary proverbs. Besides his impressive public works, including the Holy Temple, he contributed substantially to the national defense through the chariot cities - the chariots and the cavalry were two major items of the budget. His fabulous wealth was primarily due to copper mining, international trade, and Hebrew control of the sea and caravan routes (Hittite horses, Egyptian chariots, and camels, which were first domesticated during the 12th century B.C.). The next major development was something unique in mankind's history. This was the teaching of the prophets , who began with Amos in 750 B.C. and lasted five centuries. These political activists organized schools of prophets in isolated areas and dealt with all types of social problems. Their functions were two. First and much less important was the foretelling of the future. Their second and chief function was to present God's will as revealed to them by him. In fact, the Hebrew word for prophet was nabi , which means a person inspired by God: "they were moved by the Holy Ghost" (II Peter, 1:21). On the other hand, the false prophets "in sheep's clothing," as Jesus called them, were uninspired and they emphasized fees for their utterances. The prophets' teaching techniques were three: writings, oral statements, and symbolic acts ( Elijah , for instance, cast his mantle on Elisha , who succeeded him). These protesters combated idolatry, injustice, immorality, ritualism, and animal sacrifices, and preached the fatherhood of God, universal broth- erhood, mercy, righteousness, and a return to pastoral life. They thus offered ethical guidance, strengthened the Hebrews' monotheistic religion, and formulated a philosophy of history that stressed God's purpose and included Utopian elements. In general, although they dealt with current social problems, they saw continuity in the past-present-future triad, which often enabled</page><page sequence="13">HISTORY OF SOCIOLOGY 225 them to predict events rather accurately. The fall of Jerusalem in 587 B.C., for example, reinforced the prophets' prestige. The Hebrew concept of sin was also unusual, its main characteristics being as follows: 18 1. Sin was defined religiously. 2. The elements of thought and deed were separated. 3. Sin was considered inborn and universal. 4. Sins were classified inadequately - serious and less serious ones, with corresponding sanctions. 5. The etiology of sin was not highly developed. 6. Emphasis was placed on the collective nature of sin, punishment, and reward. 7. Sin could upset the harmony of the cosmos. 8. Man's sins could be forgiven by God. 9. Human sacrifices in primitive times, and guilt and sin offerings later on, were aimed at purification. 10. The law of Moses stressed moral responsibility. 11. The priests placed emphasis on ceremonial offenses, and the prophets on moral sins. The family 19 of the Hebrews was patriarchal, the father functioning as a priest and powerful manager and guardian - Jesus and Paul criticized such power. The mother, however, had much lower status, although some matriarchs were highly respected. The same double standard is seen in the belief that all unmarried women should be chaste, and that sons were more important than daughters - because, the Hebrews thought, daughters were produced by the father's left testis, which was considered smaller and weaker than the right one. Similarly, when an engaged or married woman had a lover, both offenders were put to death, whereas lack of loyalty on the part of a man was not considered adulterous. Moreover, polygyny and concubinage were common, although monogamy was regarded as the ideal type of marriage. In older times, marriage by capture was not unusual. In general, intermarriage was disapproved and parents or guardians arranged young people's marriage. Before his engagement, a young man brought substantial gifts to his future bride and a dowry of usually 50 shekels to her father, while during engagement he was exempt from military service. For various reasons, great emphasis was placed on prolific reproduction and family continuity, and even priests were allowed to marry. The levirate (Latin levir , husband's brother) custom permitted a widow to marry her deceased husband's brother. If he refused, she spat in his face and symbolically removed his shoe. Finally, adultery was one of the grounds for divorce. After the Bible, the Talmud (study or learning) is the second most important source of Judaism. This literary masterpiece is a compilation of Jewish traditions about the family, law, agriculture, holidays, prayer, etc. The Palestinian Talmud was completed in 450 A.D. and the much longer Babylon- ian Talmud in 500 A.D. Both consist of two parts, the Mishnah and the Gemara.2** VII. Egypt The civilization of ancient Egypt21 was remarkably advanced. Indeed, astronomy, mathematics, medicine, pharmacy, chemistry, geography, botany,</page><page sequence="14">226 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOR AUTUMN 1976 agriculture, painting, sculpture, architecture, and other fields had made considerable progress even in very old times. Nevertheless, these arts and sciences were extremely practical and utilitarian, as the Egyptians were not interested in theory and basic research. Astronomy, for instance, was merely aimed at time measurement and calendar construction. Similarly, the still puzzling mystery of the pyramids and other forms of architecture is indicative of knowledge of higher mathematics, but, unlike the Greeks and Romans, the Egyptians never bothered to state mathematical theorems and laws. History was also practical, its chief purpose being to serve religion. Thus, history mainly consisted of lists of kings, stressed legends, and lacked a scientific chronology. Egyptian writing advanced rapidly for at least three reasons: first, the tall and rushlike aquatic plant known as papyrus - from which the word paper comes - was abundant in the land of the Nile; second, writing was necessary for religious purposes - tomb inscriptions and temple management; and third, the complex organization of government and business required written communications.22 One of the most fascinating results of this art was The Book of the Dead. This was not an Egyptian Bible or a systematic volume. It merely constituted a collection of short manuscripts on papyrus or leather, which were placed in the tombs of the rich - either in the coffin or in the wrappings of the mummy. Most of these inscriptions were hymns to the sun, magic spells, and incantations for funeral ceremonies. The first methodical edition of The Book of the Dead was that of Karl Lepsius, the German founder of modern scientific archeology, which was a volume of 190 chapters and appeared in 1842. Religion was extremely important in ancient Egypt, as the countless magnificent temples indicate. In fact, it was involved in every aspect of human life, from festivals to pilgrimages, as well as in the realm of the dead, from mummification to funerals. In the area of ethics , we find that both secular and sacred writings emphasized a mixture of etiquette and virtue that were never distinguished clearly. The Wisdom Texts , which were the oldest Egyptian documents, influenced the Near East, including the Hebrews, considerably. These practical texts, which were based on experience and sound like lectures given by a father to his son, enjoyed very high status. The earliest Wisdom book, which is no longer extant, was that by Imhotep , a legendary sage who lived about 2770 B.C. The maxims of Ptah Hotep and Ani , which we still have, appeared later on. Here are a few "declarations of innocence" from The Book of the Dead (Budge's Papyrus of Ani): "I have not committed sin. ... I have not committed robbery with violence. ... I have not stolen. ... I have not slain men and women. ... I have not uttered lies. ... I have not uttered curses. ... I have not committed adultery, I have not lain with men. ... I have slandered no man. ... I have terrorized none. ... I have not blasphemed" (CCXXV, 1-4, 8, 10-11, 18, 23, 27; cf. Deuteronomy 5:6-21). Magic was also dominant and amulets were carried by every Egyptian. The main features of magic were two: first, emphasis on the relationship between sound and object - in the creation accounts, for instance, we find that an object was created merely by uttering its name; and second, an equal emphasis on the association between image and person or object - for example, to protect a dead man, one had to destroy his enemy's image. One of the most remarkable aspects of ancient Egypt was the similarity of its family to that of the modern West rather than to the present-day Arab</page><page sequence="15">HISTORY OF SOCIOLOGY 227 family. Indeed, a small conjugal family was the norm and consisted of husband, wife, and own children, which explains why the ancient Egyptians had only eight kinship terms. Moreover, individual choice of mate was stressed and women enjoyed substantial freedom, while the masses usually practiced monogamy. Circumcision was also common and ordinarily took place at puberty. The independence of each generation is further indicated by the absence of ancestor worship and family names. Incest , however, was legal and fairly universal.23 Finally, the chief features of education were as follows: first, in view of the warm climate, classes were usually conducted in the morning; second, males typically secured more education than females did; third, at the age of four, many children were sent to boarding schools; fourth, among the masses, especially in older times, young people were instructed at home, the main subject being the father's trade or craft; fifth, elementary schools, which were nonexistent during the Pyramid Age (2780-2280 B.C.), became rather common under the Middle and New Kingdoms (2052-1778 and 1567-1085 B.C.); sixth, in general, education consisted of apprenticeship and instruction; seventh, the primary educational goals were knowledge and, through it, morality, piety, self-control, bravery, respect for parents, social responsibility, and submission to the pharaoh and the bureaucrats; eighth, the most important subjects were the three R's, while sports were sacrificed upon the altar of knowledge and music was considered too feminine; ninth, in writing, style was stressed at the expense of content - which recalls the theme of Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest; tenth, the main forms of discipline were corporal punishment and copying the first part of some Egyptian classic - this has facilitated the survival of the introductory sections of many important documents; and eleventh, students did not take formal examinations.24 VIII. Greece Greek social thought,25 which has influenced Rome and the entire West considerably, was worldly, profound, and highly intellectual. In fact, it stressed intellectuality at the expense of the affective and the supernatural. Democracy was a dominant ideal, but in reality women were not allowed to vote and, in classical times, the population of Athens was about one third of a million, approximately 90 percent of the people being slaves. Social thought itself was aristocratic and typically ignored the masses, since most thinkers came from upper-class families (aristocracy then meant rule by the best, and democracy something like ochlocracy or mob rule). The main reasons for such theoretical progress were the strategic geographical position of the city-states, urbanization, social unrest, frequent wars, and the rise of the Sophists. The Greek philosophers and Sophists differed in many respects, including the following: 1. The philosophers usually studied nature, but the Sophists examined culture. 2. Philosophical thinking was deductive (to achieve cosmic unity through universal laws), while the Sophists preferred induction. 3. The philosophers' goal was knowledge itself, which explains why they did not need students. The Sophists, however, sought practical solutions,</page><page sequence="16">228 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOR AUTUMN 1976 since their motto was to live first and then philosophize: "Primum vivere deinde philosophare." Many of them thus became great statesmen, but their emphasis on high fees and popularity among their students gradually led to their decline. Even today we speak of sophisms and sophistries , namely, plausible but misleading arguments. Typical of the Sophists' logic is the following incident: a self-confident Sophist told his law student that, thanks to his master's genius, he would soon become a great lawyer. In fact, the teacher asked the young man to pay the instructional fee only if and when he won his first case. When the student completed his training, however, he refused to practice law. Therefore, the Sophist took him to court, where he pompously declared that his victory was certain. Why? Because, if he won the case, then, by virtue of the court's verdict, he should collect the fee. But, if he lost, then, by virtue of their old agreement, he should also collect the fee, since his loss would mean that his student had won his first case. Nevertheless, the young lawyer, who had learned his lesson quite well, expressed his surprise at such nonsense and then argued: "The victory is definitely mine. For, if I win this case, then, by virtue of the court's decision, I must not pay you. But, if I lose, then, by virtue of our agreement, I must not pay you either, since I will have lost my first case!" 4. The philosophers dealt with objects, and the Sophists with both objects and abstract ideas - good, evil, justice, inequality, conflict, etc. 5. The philosophers stressed empirical evidence, and the Sophists epis- temology, asserting that knowledge is not absolute but depends on the knower. They thus discovered cultural relativism and the sociology of knowledge, the main reason for this being their familiarity with many different cultures, which the historian Herodotus had described. In education, the Sophists emphasized citizenship and the belief that all are educable. They also advocated a variety of educational methods, thus introducing the idea of liberal arts. It has been said that the Sophists discussed all major social issues, and that for thousands of years we have not added a single such issue to their list. Some of them even anticipated various modern theories - for instance, Aetius (first or second century A.D.) and the relativity of time. They further questioned all social norms - in view of the social change that prevailed in their time - and promoted all types of thinking. In fact, without the Sophists, there would have been no Socrates, Plato, or Aristotle. Three of the best known Sophists were Górgias (485-380 B.C.), who stressed the value of oratory; Protagoras (485-415 B.C.), who considered virtue supreme; and Hippias (469-399 B.C.), who emphasized the training of memory. Some ancients thought of Pythagoras and Socrates as Sophists. Before the Sophists, came the legendary Lycurgus , father of the Spartan constitution, which stressed stability and social order. Homer (about 800 B.C.) wrote the Iliad and the Odyssey , two epic poems dealing with the Trojan War (about 1180 B.C.) and describing various cultures and social institutions. The amphictionies were the first United Nations, namely, political and religious confederacies of Greek states whose goals were interna- tional cooperation and order and the formation of international law. Perhaps the earliest one appeared about 800 B.C. Hesiod (750 B.C.), another epic poet, wrote Works and Days, a farmer's almanac replete with didactic maxims and dealing with a peasant's life. His philosophy was pessimistic, as is indicated by his Hawk and the Nightingale , which recalls La Fontaine's</page><page sequence="17">HISTORY OF SOCIOLOGY 229 The Wolf and the Lamb. He also formulated a theory of social evolution covering five stages, the ages of gold, silver, bronze, heroes, and iron. In 621 B.C., Draco introduced a severe code which enabled the Athenian government to intervene in the citizen's life more than ever. Because of the code's harshness, we still speak of draconic laws and measures. Another lawgiver was Solon (639-561 B.C.), who gave Athens a new constitution (a solon today is a legislator). Solon proclaimed amnesty for the sake of peace, supported debtors, punished parents who neglected their children, and gave more freedoms to the individual. Pythagoras, the so-called father of music and mathematics, was born in 570 B.C. Still famous for the Pythagorean theorem , he is also remembered as the founder of a religious fraternity aimed at the liberation of the soul from the body through asceticism and the study of nature. He believed that "all things are numbers" and that metempsychosis , or reincarnation of the soul , is universal. This explains the Socratic method (teaching through questions), which is still popular in education today, and which was then inspired by the belief that stimulating questions would enable the student to recall the answers he knew in one of his previous lives. A member of the Pythagorean school, Archy tas, who was a great mathematician, engineer, inventor, and statesman, influenced Plato considerably. Heraclitus of Ephesus (540-475 B.C.), the forerunner of Hegel and Marx in dialectics, wrote On Nature. This book, which deals with the universe, politics, and religion, made him the father of the concept of change. Indeed, he believed that change is eternal and universal, that change and continuity are inseparable, and that there is a constant conflict of opposites that is the origin of everything, including unity, balance, and harmony. He worte: "War is the father of all and king of all. . . . Homer was wrong to hope that war would vanish." Cleisthenes, a brilliant Athenian statesman and reformer, introduced a constitution in 508 B.C. that was more democratic than Solon's. Such democratization consisted mainly of a higher number of senate members and of decentralization through more and smaller administrative units, which were similar to the French departments created after the Revolution. Pericles (495-429 B.C.) was a remarkable Athenian orator, general, and statesman whose incorruptible character made Athens powerful and prosperous. In fact, the city achieved its highest artistic triumphs under Pericles. He also advocated peace and freedom of the seas, but Sparta opposed him successfully in these respects. Herodotus (485-425 B.C.), the so-called father of history, was a great historian, human geographer, ethnographer, and descriptive sociologist. After reading everything he could and traveling for 17 years from Italy to Babylon and from Egypt to the Black Sea, he wrote his still popular masterpiece, Histories, consisting of nine books named after the nine Muses. The second book deals with Egypt and, as modern Egyptology proves, is fairly accurate. Herodotus even wrote objectively about the Persians, Greece's mortal enemies, which explains why Plutarch described him as "a friend of the barbarians." His philosophy of history is dominated by the idea of divine justice. Hippocrates (460-377 B.C.), the greatest Greek physician, is known as the father of medicine and anthropogeography. His Hippocratic Oath is still famous: "I swear by Apollo the physician. . . not to administer a poison to anyone when I am asked, nor to give such advice. Similarly, I will not give a pessary to a woman to cause abortion. . . . Whatever house I enter, I will come to help the sick, and I will refrain from all intentional injustice and harm, especially from sexual abuse against the bodies of men and women, of free persons and slaves. And whatever I see or hear. . . which</page><page sequence="18">230 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOR AUTUMN 1976 must never be mentioned outside, I will never reveal, considering such things holy secrets." The three tragedians, Aeschylus (525-456 B.C.), Sophocles (496-406 B.C.), and Euripides (480-406 B.C.), and the comedian Aristophanes (448-380 B.C.), who are still popular and influential in the West, analyzed human nature and social institutions with exceptional brilliance and insight. Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle were Greece's greatest philosophers and social thinkers. Socrates (470-399 B.C.), who wrote nothing, was the son of a sculptor and a midwife. As a young man, he studied natural science but found it inadequate. Therefore - also, because previous thinkers had overemphasized the study of nature - he decided to explore man and his culture (this is the meaning of the Socratic "Know thyself"). His war against ignorance led to his famous sayings concerning individual and social problems: "Goodness is knowledge" and "No one is voluntarily bad," that is, sin and antisocial behavior are due to ignorance. The Socratic method - investigation through questions and arguments - had actually been introduced by Zeno of Elea (born 490 B.C., author of famous paradoxes and founder of dialectic), but Socrates applied it for the first time to esthetics and ethics, thus becoming the father of formal logic. Since he encouraged young people to criticize the establishment, he was sentenced to death. But, partly because of his belief in the immortality of the soul, he refused to escape when he had a chance to do so. Instead, he remained in prison and drank the hemlock. Plato (427-347 B.C.), the first Western thinker to develop a major social system, wrote the Republic, Laws , Dialogues , etc. The Republic and Aristotle's Politics are the main sources of Greek social thought. Plato believed in eternal Ideas , common objects being merely their shadows, with the Idea of the Good reigning at the top. He considered the soul immortal and consisting of three parts, reason, bad emotions, and good emotions. His Sophist and Statesman established the art of logic. To him, virtue is knowledge and its own reward, while knowledge is recollection, since the immortal soul may remember elements from its previous lives. As for government, it should be under philosopher-kings , who should control the two remaining social classes, soldiers and farmer-artisans. Absolute justice, professional specializa- tion, and censorship of the arts should prevail. In the two upper classes, women should be emancipated and private property and the family should be abolished. Aristotle (384-322 B.C.), the son of a physician and the teacher of Alexander the Great, studied in Plato's Academy. As a lecturer and student researcher, he was so brilliant that Plato called him "the brain of the university," or "the reader," since he had read all available books and was a walking encyclopedia. His more than 400 works, which were written exclusively for his students and constituted one of the greatest encyclopedias of all time, included his Politics and Nicomachean Ethics. His Lyceum was known as the Peripatetic School because he and his students preferred to walk while discussing art, philosophy, and science. Unlike Plato, who viewed the world statically, Aristotle considered it as a dynamic and changing entity. He further spoke of teleology, which means that he saw a rational plan in the universe. To him, the supreme good is man's happiness, which may be achieved through intellectual pursuits. Moreover, virtue is the mean, while vice coincides with excess or deficiency - for example, modesty (mean), bashfulness (excess), and shamelessness (deficiency). His method included the famous typology of causes, which are four: material cause (e.g., wood, of which a chair is made);</page><page sequence="19">HISTORY OF SOCIOLOGY 231 formal cause (what the chair is essentially, namely, its form or shape); efficient cause (its creator or the carpenter's thought); and final cause (its function or purpose, that is, sitting). Aristotle also introduced the inductive method and, critical as he was of dogmatic thinking, considered all relevant facts in each issue, discussed both sides, and only then drew conclusions. That is why his method is as important as his generalizations. Epicurus (342-270 B.C.) founded his school in a garden near Plato's Academy. Thus, the four celebrated universities of ancient Athens were Plato's Academy , Aristotle's Lyceum , the Garden of Epicurus, and the Porch of the Stoics. Epicurus wrote 300 volumes, but only a few fragments have survived. To him, happiness means absence of anxiety and the supreme good is pleasure (Epicurus would say, "Enjoy thyself"; Socrates, "Know thyself"; Zeno the Stoic, "Control thyself"; and Jesus, "Give thyself"). But, although we still speak of an epicure as a person with "vulgar" hedonistic tendencies, the philosophy of Epicurus was much nobler than is often assumed. Zeno ofCitium in Cyprus (342-270 B.C.) founded the Stoic School , which flourished mainly in Rome. Polybius (205-125 B.C.) was an Arcadian historian who lived in Rome, where he was taken as a hostage. His great History stresses etiology at the expense of sensationalism and presents history as an art with two goals: to educate statesmen and to teach the masses to face misfortune. Plutarch (46-120 A.D.), a philosopher, moralist, and biographer, wrote Parallel Lives and Moralia. These masterpieces, which have influenced the entire world, deal with ethics rather than history. IX. Rome It is often asserted that Rome,26 unlike Greece, which cultivated art, philosophy, science, literature, and theory, was a mere imitator of the Greek civilization and stressed practical matters. But, first of all, both theory and application are very important and useful. Then, although Rome did not have truly great thinkers or systems, and although Stoicism was born in Athens, Stoicism was developed extensively and intensively in the Eternal City, thus facilitating the adoption of Christianity. Finally, Rome's genius was incomparable in the areas of engineering, architecture, military science, administration, and law. As early as 450 B.C., for instance, the Romans published their first major code, Lex Duodecim Tabularum (Law of the Twelve Tables). Their first notable thinker, on the other hand, was Cicero (106-43 B.C.), an orator, man of letters, philosopher, and statesman. One of his countless works was De Republica, in which he defends human rights and presents the ideal government as one based on a constitution including elements of democracy, oligarchy, and monarchy. The Stoic idea of universal brotherhood is also emphasized. Another Stoic idea is found in De Legibus, where the divine origin of law is constantly stressed. Julius Caesar (100-44 B.C.), a great general, statesman, and author, wrote De Bello Gallico. Beginning with "Gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres " ("Gaul is a whole divided into three parts"), this famous work contains much descriptive sociology and social anthropology. For instance, Caesar writes: "Throughout Gaul, there are two social classes that are important. As for common people, they are treated almost like slaves. ... Of the above mentioned two classes, one is that of the Druids and the other of the knights. The</page><page sequence="20">232 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOR AUTUMN 1976 former deal with divine worship, perform public and private sacrifices, and interpret religious matters" (VI, 13). Lucretius (96-55 B.C.), one of the greatest poets of all time, wrote De Rerum Natura , a didactic epic on the philosophy of Epicurus. This sublime masterpiece, which made Lucretius the father of anthropology, contains countless striking ideas, such as: social and biological evolution based on the struggle for existence, natural selection, adaptation, and survival of the fittest; materialism; natural explanations of various phenomena; the existence of other universes, as well as of atoms and subatomic particles; theories of conflict and revolution; and other modern scientific theories. It is no wonder, then, that Elizabeth Browning said about Lucretius: "He died chief poet on the Tiber side." Seneca (4 B.C. -65 A.D.), Nero's tutor and minister, was a Stoic philosopher, orator, financier, diplomat, and statesman. His numerous works include 10 Dialogues , nine Tragedies , and Moral Essays. Seneca's Stoicism was more practical than Zeno's, as he stressed moral teaching at the expense of philosophy. Unfortunately, from ancient times to the present, his brilliant writings have been appreciated less than they deserve simply because Seneca's private life was less noble than his teachings. Epictetus (60-120 A.D.) was a Greek philosopher who taught Stoicism in Rome. Since he never wrote anything, what we know about his ideas is based on the Discourses , which consists of his lectures as published by Arrian (96-180 A.D.), a Greek historian and one of his pupils. Finally, Marcus Aurelius (121-180 A.D.) was a Roman emperor who adopted Stoicism. His Meditations was written in Greek and consisted primarily of Stoic principles which he wrote at random for his own personal guidance. Here are some famous examples: "Men have been created for the sake of one another. Therefore, either teach or endure" (VIII, 59); "The best way to avenge yourself is not to do likewise" (VI, 6); "Make yourself shine with simplicity and modesty" (VII, 31); and "Remember that all things are only what we think they are" (II, 15). X. Christianity "Three centuries before Christ, Zeno . . . who founded the school of Stoicism in Athens, spoke of a cosmic Reason, a purposive and immanent Logos animating the entire world. This Logos was later identified with Jesus Christ, the second person of the Christian Trinity. The same Greek philospher, in a pantheistic manner, conceived of cosmic unity, which led to the concept of universal brotherhood, and which influenced the Romans considerably. In less abstract fashion, the founder of Christianity taught the brotherhood of man, one of the basic Christian doctrines, by asserting that God was the Father of all people."27 The social institution that Jesus supported most was the family - perhaps, only Confucianism surpasses Christianity in such support. "This is indicated by at least three facts: first, Christ emphasized God's fatherhood and man's brotherhood - Christianity's two fundamental principles - also employing in- numerable metaphors and similes derived from family life - of course, accord- ing to Mark 3:35, spiritual relationships are more important than biological ones. . . second, Jesus devoted most of his life to his earthly family , working as a carpenter at Nazareth; and third, even while on the cross, he was concerned with his mothers welfare."28</page><page sequence="21">HISTORY OF SOCIOLOGY 233 As for the poor , Jesus always stressed mercy, charity, and sharing. According to Luke 18:22, "sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor"; but "let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth" (Matthew 6:3). Moreover, social service in general was of great importance, as is suggested, for instance, by the institution of the "brides of Christ," the virgins who did social work among the needy. The Hebrew concept of justice was at first confined to the authority of patriarch and king and then, under the prophets, became more democratic and universal. Jesus, however, who attacked the ceremonial formalities of the Pharisees, added an affective element and stressed the golden rule: "whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart" (Matthew 5:28); and "whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them" (7:12). The old Hebrew idea of peace ( shalom ) was also expanded by the Messiah, whom Isaiah called the "Prince of Peace." Indeed, Jesus taught that peace must be combined with love and forgiveness, and that justice without peace is impossible: "Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall seethe Lord" (Hebrews 12:14); and "Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God" (Matthew 5:9). Paul , on the other hand, has contributed the greatest hymn to love. Love, he says, "Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things" (I Corinthians, 13:5-7). XI. Middle Ages Four of the greatest thinkers during the Middle Ages were Saint Augustine, Saint Thomas Aquinas, Dante, and Ibn Khaldun. Saint Augustine (354-430) was at first influenced by Manichaeanism, which stressed the conflict between good and evil. Later on, he went to Milan, where he adopted Plato's philosophy and, through this system, Christianity. His Confessions is one of the greatest autobiographies of all time - partly because the author was at war with himself, not with the world. But The City of God (426 A.D.) has been much more famous and influential. In 410 A.D., the Goths of Alaric had sacked Rome and, in the midst of the chaos that prevailed, many giants attempted to explain the decline of the Roman Empire. Saint Augustine gave his own historical arguments in his masterpiece and, at the same time, tried to win over those who still believed in pagan divinities. The first part of the book asserts that polytheism does not generate happiness. Subsequent sections describe the miserable city of this world and the Utopian City of God, where Truth is the King, Love is the Law, and Eternity the Measure. Saint Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274), the so-called " Doctor Angelicus," was a Dominican philosopher and theologian. His name derives from Aquino, Italy, near which he was born. One of the greatest influences on Thomas was Aristotle, whose ideas he applied to Christianity. His still highly regarded masterpiece, Summa Theologica (1265-1272), is a synopsis of all knowledge in three parts: The Natural, which treats theology as a science, despite its supernatural elements; The Moral, which deals with psychology and ethics, including the seven virtues - faith , hope, charity , prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance; and The Sacramental, which presents the sacraments as</page><page sequence="22">234 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOR AUTUMN 1976 the means to man's salvation. Thomas based his teaching on a distinction between faith and reason, which he considered complementary. His theory of knowledge, which was inspired by Aristotle, was that cognition originates in sense perception: " Nihil in intellectu quod non prius fuerit in sensu Saint Thomas was the greatest representative of Scholasticism , the medieval philosophical and theological system that attempts to explain revelation intellectually, that is, by both reason and faith. Dante Alighieri (1265-1321), the brilliant Italian poet, was born in Florence and studied under the Dominicans. Dante is a contraction of Durante, the name of his maternal grandfather. His love of Beatrice, the Florentine girl who married a Bardi, was immortalized in his Divina Commedia (1320). An earlier work, De Monarchia ( 1313), deals with social and political ideas. Global peace and order, here Dante asserts, presuppose a double universal monarchy based in Rome, this choice being justified by world history and the Bible. One of the two independent rulers is a divinely appointed king, who is concerned with this world and man's temporal happiness. Man's eternal blessedness in the afterlife is the domain of the pope, the other universal ruler. Ibn Khaldun ( 1332- 1406), a great Arab historian, philosopher, social scientist, and statesman, has often been regarded as the father of sociology and of the philosophy of history. The first volume of his seven-volume history of Arabs and Berbers is entitled Al-Muqaddimah ( The Prolegomena ). Even today the last two volumes are the best work on the history of northwest Africa. The first volume, however, is such an incisive philosophy of history that Ibn Khaldun became famous as the author of Al-Muqaddimah. The reasons for writing his history were three: the diminishing of Muslim power, the decline of Muslim philosophy, and the Muslim thinkers' constant effort to reconcile Greek thought with the Quran. Ibn Khaldun's answer to this decline was to employ history as a method of finding causes. Therefore, while previous Muslim authors conceived of God as the first and only cause, Ibn Khaldun stressed the discovery of historical causes through reason. This was his celebrated science of umran (civilization), which emphasized natural laws and made him both a true social scientist and a notable philosopher of history. Some of his conclusions were as follows: man is born sociable; his needs are a dominant force; the cooperation necessary for the satisfaction of these needs leads to the formation of society; and social phenomena may be explained by multiple factors. XII. Modern Times Some of the modern thinkers29 who have contributed to the development of sociology were the following: Niccolò Machiavelli (1469-1527), an Italian author and statesman, wrote The Prince (1513), a realistic manual dealing with political power and types of monarchy. Its emphasis on centralization was due to Machiavelli's dream of a united Italy, an idea which foreshadowed the modern nation-state. Sir Thomas More (1478-1535), the English author of Utopia (1516), was inspired by Plato. His work is replete with symbolic Greek names, such as these: Amaurote (Dark Place), Anyder River (Waterless River), King Ademus (King Without People), Hythloday (Talker of Nonsense), Macariens (Happy Ones), etc. Even Utopia, which he coined, means either No Place or Good Place (More used both meanings). After discussing the social problems of</page><page sequence="23">HISTORY OF SOCIOLOGY 235 his world, the author presents a perfect society. Strangely enough, some of its customs are extremely similar to those of the Incas of Peru. In Utopia there is no private property, luxury is condemned, the working day is only six hours long, city people often help in the rural areas, euthanasia is common, houses are uniform and remain always unlocked, and marriage practices include the nude inspection of one's future spouse to discover possible defects. Sir Francis Bacon (1561-1626), another English author, wrote The New Atlantis (1627), a utopia inspired by Thomas More. The island of Bensalem includes Solomon's House, a college symbolizing Bacon's emphasis on scientific thinking. Some of the inventions discussed are incredibly modern: air transportation, submarines, telephones, oxygen tanks, refrigeration, artifi- cial flavors, vivisection, advanced botanical techniques, etc. Bacon also contributed his famous four idols in scientific methodology: idols of the tribe (stressing anthropomorphic superstitions at the expense of facts); idols of the cave (personal prejudices); idols of the forum (excessive dependence on language and careless definitions of terms); and idols of the theater (blind acceptance of tradition and authority). Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679), also English, published his Leviathan in 1651. This classic deals with man, the commonwealth, a Christian common- wealth, and the kingdom of darkness. Hobbes describes human nature mechanistically and avers that, at first, conflict prevailed universally. Reason, however, led to two laws of nature, seeking peace and laying down one's rights. Thus, through a social contract, absolute power was conferred on one person or assembly. Incidentally, the leviathan was a biblical sea monster (Job 41:1). Baruch Spinoza (1632-1677), "the Protesting Jew," was the author of Ethics (1677) and many other works. His Ethics resembles a magnificent drama in five acts and deals with an ethical system which the author tries to defend geometrically. John Locke (1632-1704), an English philosopher, adopted the social contract theory, but added that power returns to the people when the sovereign becomes a despot. Giovanni Battista Vico (1668-1744), the son of a Naples bookseller, wrote Di Una Scienza Nuova (On a New Science , which, to a great extent, means sociology). Vico considered ethnocentrism universal and dangerous and advocated empirical, inductive reasoning. His theory of social change is of the spiral type, since the many ricorsi (returns) of social evolution involve constant self-renewal and advancement, which Vico calls "ideal eternal history." Montesquieu (1689-1755), a French political philosopher, jurist, and author, published The Spirit of the Laws in 1748. His emphasis on empirical, inductive thinking made him one of the greatest social scientists of all time. One of his main ideas was that geography influences a given country's form of givernment. Jean Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778), also French, wrote Social Contract , one of the most brilliant books in human history. Man is born free, Rousseau said, but finds himself everywhere in chains. His theory of the social contract, which combines ethics with politics, states that men are free when the state follows the general will. Unfortunately, the concept of the general will is nebulous and Rousseau neglected minority rights. The Wealth of Nations (1776), by Adam Smith (1723-1790), the Scotsman who founded political economy, is a masterpiece of individualism. A practical</page><page sequence="24">236 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOR AUTUMN 1976 and theoretical work, it defines wealth as the sum total of labor and the goods consumed by people. State regulation of the economy is condemned (Smith's ideas led to free trade) and history is used to prove the weaknesses of human laws. Thomas Robert Malthus (1766-1834), an English clergyman and economist, wrote a currently popular work, The Essay on the Principle of Population (1798). Montesquieu and Benjamin Franklin spoke of Malthusianism before Malthus. The latter, however, dramatized this issue by asserting that population increases geometrically (1,2,4,8,16,32. . .), and the means of subsistence, arithmetically (1,2,3,4,5,6. . .). His solution to the population problem was sexual abstinence, as well as celibacy for the lower classes. Auguste Comte (1798-1857), the French "father" of sociology and author of Positive Philosophy (1830-1842) and Positive Polity (1851-1854), distin- guished three types of thinking in social evolution, theological , metaphysical , and positive (empirical observation and systematic classification). The various sciences he ranked as follows, from the lowest to the highest: mathematics , astronomy , physics, chemistry , biology , anthropology , and sociology . He also coined the term sociology, by which he meant what he called social physics . Karl Marx (1818-1883), a German political economist and philosopher who founded world communism, wrote the most famous study in economic theory, namely, Das Kapital (1867-1895). Modern socialism has been inspired by this work. The Communist Manifesto (1847), written with Friedrich Engels, remains the most influential statement of Marxism. Its opening words are, "A spectre is haunting Europe," and its closing words, "The workers have nothing to lose but their chains; they have a whole world to gain. Workers of all countries, unite." Its central theory is economic determinism or historical materialism, and its theme: "The history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggles." The book predicts that the proletarian revolution will put an end to capitalism. Marxian evolution postulates four stages, that is, savagery, barbarism, capitalism, and communism . Such change is based on Hegel's idea of thesis (affirmation), antithesis (negation), and synthesis (reconciliation). Marx's German Ideology (1846) has recently pro- moted the study of alienation. Herbert Spencer (1820-1903), a British philosopher, sociologist, and railway engineer, wrote First Principles (1862), The Principles of Sociology (1876- 1896), etc. His theory of biological and social evolution included the concepts of natural selection and the survival of the fittest, human society thus moving from militaristic savagery through semi-industrial barbarism to modem indus- trial society . This means a change from status to contract, from slavery to freedom . Spencer also adopted Comte's division of sociology into social statics and social dynamics, but rejected the idea of planned social change. As a laissez-faire individualist, he considered the state less important than the individual. He further dreamed of a future world, without war and national boundaries, dominated by six sets of social institutions: professional, industrial domestic, ceremonial, political, and ecclesiastical. Gabriel Tarde (1834-1904), the French jurist and father of social psychology, stressed the influence of environment on human behavior ( Les Lois de l'Imitation, 1890). His laws of imitation involve a cycle of four processes: inventions, imitation of such inventions, opposition to these inventions, and the rise of new inventions through adaptation. William Sumner (1840-1910), a Protestant Episcopal priest and^ professor of political and social science at Yale University, is known as the "American</page><page sequence="25">HISTORY OF SOCIOLOGY 237 Spencer." Indeed, he was a laissez-faire individualist who advocated social Darwinism (free competition and survival of the physically and socially fittest) and opposed the welfare state. His most famous work is Folkways (1907). Another American sociologist, Lester Ward (1841-1913), was a geologist and paleontologist who opposed social Darwinism vehemently. His Dynamic Sociology (1883) made him the father of American sociology. His most famous concept is social telesis, namely, planned social change through universal education and science, an idea that influenced John Dewey. This idea is based on Ward's distinction between two kinds of social dynamics , which deals with social progress: pure sociology , the study of what is, and applied sociology, the study of what ought to be. His theory of social evolution postulates four main stages: autarchic stage (egoistic and antisocial isolation), aggregate (association for survival), government (union of tribes for protection and peace), and pantarchic stage (future peaceful society with a world government and one language). Vilfredo Pareto (1848-1923), an Italian engineer, economist, and sociologist, published Trattato di Sociologia Generale in 1915. Pareto tried to show that social behavior is usually nonlogical. His cyclical theory of social change is known as the " circulation of elites 99 which means that history repeats itself as conservative and progressive leaders acquire power in successive turns. Albion Small (1854-1926), the fourth president of the American Sociological Society and founder of The American Journal of Sociology in 1895, wrote Introduction to the Study of Society (1894), General Sociology (1905), etc. His main contribution was the theory of six interests ( health , wealth , sociability , knowledge, beauty , and rightness). Society results from a conflict of these interests, but, through socialization, cooperation ultimately prevails. Ferdinand Tönnies (1855-1936), a German sociologist and author of Ge- meinschaft und Gesellschaft (1887), wrote on two important concepts: Ge- meinschaft, or community, which is based on essential or natural will, and Gesellschaft, or society, which is the product of arbitrary or rational will. He thus emphasized ideal types as a way of locating empirical entities somewhere between them. He also predicted that the change from rural life to city life would be followed by a cooperative, socialist way of life. Franklin Giddings (1855-1931), professor of sociology at Columbia Univer- sity and author of Principles of Sociology (1896), was one of the founding fathers of American sociology. His theory of "consciousness of kind," which he later called " pluralistic behavior 99 states that, through common stimulation, suggestion, and imitation, human beings adopt similar ideals and thus organize themselves. Georg Simmel ( 1858- 1918), a German sociologist and philosopher and author of Soziologie ( 1908), conceived of sociology as the study of forms of interaction. He thus investigated numerous reciprocal relations, including play, eroticism, slavery, conversation, and conflict. Émile Durkheim (1858-1917), a French sociologist, wrote The Division of Labor in Society (1893), The Rules of Sociological Method (1895), Suicide (1897), The Elementary Forms of Religious Life (1912), etc. Durkheim, who criticized Spencerian individualism, saw sociology as the study of social facts, which are external to individuals and control their behavior (for example, laws). He thus spoke of " collective representations," namely, group symbols based on " collective consciousness 99 and having constraining power. Similarly, " religious representations 99 are collective symbols related to social norms.</page><page sequence="26">238 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOR AUTUMN 1976 God, in other words, is nothing but society itself. This explains why Australian totems are both sacred and clan symbols. Durkheim's famous theory of the division of labor states that, in primitive societies, such division is limited and the dictates of the group are obeyed unquestioningly. This he calls " mechanical solidarity ." In advanced societies, however, the division of labor is much more complex and there is "organic solidarity 99 that is, balance between interdependence and individual freedom. His also well-known concept of anomie (Greek a, no, and nomos , law) refers to lawlessness or normlessness and decline in social order. This means that social norms are either absent or in conflict with one another. Such anomie is the cause of one of the three types of suicide that Durkheim distinguished, namely, " anomie suicide ." The second type is " egoistic suicide 99 and is due to an individual disorder generated by excessive isolation (suicide is more common among Protestants than Catholics). The third type is " altruistic suicide 99 which is self-sacrifice because of conformity to one's group (for instance, soldiers and officers). Charles Cooley (1864-1929), a professor of sociology at the University of Michigan, wrote Human Nature and the Social Order (1902), Social Organization (1909), and other important books. Cooley considered society and the individual complementary, society being the sum total of interacting individuals and resembling an organism consisting of differentiated and interdependent parts. His concept of the " looking-glass self 9 refers to the individual's interpretation of himself on the basis of other persons' reactions to him. The self is thus influenced by what Cooley called primary groups , namely, groups characterized by cooperation and intimate face-to-face associa- tion (for example, family, neighborhood, and play group). Max Weber (1864-1920), a German sociologist, was a prolific author whose works include Collected Essays in the Sociology of Religion (1920-1921), Collected Essays on Scientific Theory (1922), and Collected Essays in Sociology and Social Politics (1924). Weber stressed the inductive method in the study of social phenomena, thus seeking the causes and effects of social behavior. He also emphasized the sociohistorical approach, asserting that this is the only way to understand any society and make useful compari- sons. Thanks to such methodology, his essays are replete with countless brilliant hypotheses. His concept of Wertfreiheit refers to ethical neutrality in sociological research. The Protestant ethic was viewed as one of the forces that generated capitalism, which Weber investigated in unique fashion, namely, instead of scrutinizing its development in the West, he studied those areas in which capitalism was nonexistent. His three types of legitimate authority are " legal authority,99 " traditional authority,99 and " charismatic authority99 (from the Greek charisma, divine gift), which means leadership based on unusual personal attributes. His typology of social behavior includes purpose- rational behavior, value-rational behavior (whose worth is determined by religious or philosophical criteria), affectual behavior (based on emotions), and traditionalistic behavior. Finally, his ideal types, such as perfect competi- tion, deal with extreme features which are not found in the empirical world, but which enable us to locate and study real phenomena between two opposite poles. Summary As Max Weber asserted, it is impossible to understand a given society without employing the sociohistorical and comparative approaches. In the</page><page sequence="27">HISTORY OF SOCIOLOGY 239 same way, a sociology for a changing world must view both past and present and thus facilitate insight into the future. For this reason, here has been included a brief history of ancient, medieval, and modern thinkers and systems that have influenced the development of sociology. Since every synopsis is inevitably inadequate, the reader may pursue in detail those authors and schools that interest him most and confine himself to the summaries presented here for the remaining topics. The fairly complete outline given in this chapter renders such selectivity easier. Of course, many recent sociologists have been omitted. But it is impossible to include all of them in an outline of this type. Besides, their contributions will be mentioned in subsequent chapters, which deal with basic sociological concepts. Notes 1.
