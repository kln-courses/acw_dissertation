<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Explanation of Social Behaviour. By R. HARRI and P. F. SECORD. (Oxford : Basil Blackwell. 1972. Pp. vii + 327. Price ?3.75.) The Explanation of Social Behaviour is not concerned with the explanation of all forms of social behaviour. Its relevance to economics or political science, for example, is at best indirect. But if its scope is more or less that of social psychology, the book's ambitions are large enough. In the terminology of T. S. Kuhn, which the authors very explicitly use to describe their ambitions, they are setting out to discredit an Old Paradigm and substitute a New Paradigm. The old paradigm is that which has domin- ated the social sciences in the past half century; it assumes that "only a mechanical model of man will satisfy the requirements for making a science ", that causation is only invariable sequence, and that logical positivism underpins the best scientific methodology. Anyone familiar with Kuhn's work, or, indeed, with Harre's earlier essays on the nature of theory, will not find the repudiation of these assumptions very startling. The new paradigm sees human beings as active, self-monitoring agents aware of what roles they are playing in the social " game ", " drama " or " ritual ", and it sees the role of explanation not so much in terms of finding correlations but in guessing at and investigating the properties of the generative mechanisms underlying the ob- served phenomena. As for the positivist image of theory as no more than " a set of rules for anticipating sense experience ", the authors are quick to impugn its legitimacy by ascribing its origins to " Berkeley's attempt to establish the existence of God and other spirits by denying that matter had causal powers ". The positivist image of science bears little resemblance to the practice of any developed science, and the "new paradigm " for social science involves taking the practice of the developed sciences more seriously than the philosophical misdescription of them. In insisting on the " anthropomorphic model of man ", Harr6 and Secord point to its importance in requiring an adequate grammar to account for the sequences of meaningful behaviour and in suggesting realistic hypotheses about the neuro- physiological mechanisms which provide the physical events to which meaning is attached. The similarities to Chomsky's aspirations for linguistic theory are, of course, exploited to the full in such claims. As developed here, the " new paradigm " seems to produce a rather curious mixture of genuine insight and the merely commonplace. The self-confidence with which the authors' claims are put forward induces a good deal of irritation when the mountain yields a mouse. Thus, for example, the suggestion that mental illness may be caused either by a physical breakdown in the organism or by a failure to identify the meaning of the actions of others or by "failure to know the correct rule for responding " is wholly plausible. But it is hard to think of any paradigm which admitted the concept of mental illness at all which would deny this claim. Enthusiasm is not fostered by the way this leads into a moderated account of R. D. Laing's highly politicized account of schizophrenia; the book's version of Laing boils down to the (wholly proper) claim that we ought to be very careful not to confuse "ethogenic " and "pathological" illness, since enforced incarceration may well produce physiological changes of an</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 375 abnormal kind, even though these were not the cause of the condition in the first place, and it may teach the inmate the "wrong rules ". But a more interesting question is whether the new paradigm offers any insight into Laing's claim that families drive some of their members into madness. Again, Laing's attempts to make sense out of the schizoid's apparent ravings offers the new paradigm just the puzzle it has to tackle if we are to take seriously its claimed affinities with Chomskyan linguistics. The prob- lem of what to count as " nonsensical " behaviour is clearly quite inescapable. But irritation is by no means the dominant feeling aroused by a book which is always thought-provoking and which keeps its eye firmly on the central issues; indeed, the grasp of what is central is one of the book's most admirable features. Two of the major problems of the philosophy of social science come up over and over again. The first is that of how we pick models and analogies on which to base the explanation of episodes of human interaction. The authors are enthusiastic about the work of Erving Goffman, which relies upon treating much of human behaviour as if it is a performance of a dramatic kind. Now this raises the question of whether this is merely one analogy which we might exploit for its heuristic value or whether it is a genuinely explanatory theory. It ought, on the authors' attachment to a realist interpretation of theory, to be the latter. But then we have trouble on our hands concerning the authors' insistence that we derive our empirical data by asking the participants in episodes what they are doing-an insistence strong enough to motivate an entire chapter entitled " Why not ask them ? ". For one obvious reason for not asking them is that they do not, and are not willing to, see themselves as playing a part in a drama. Goffman himself has always been inexplicit about just how stylistic and dramatic considerations interact with straightforwardly technical and functional considerations. The authors refer to Goff- man's " inspired and intuitive technique ", but it cannot be said that they make good their offer to show just how it is explicable as a methodology. It is, of course, not enough to say simply that it is a technique which is useful for " certain purposes ", as though common sense will tell us which purposes-if for no other reason than that one achievement of science is to upset common sense notions about classification and explanation. The second problem is that of checking the truth of our explanations. Here we run into something of a contradiction, with the authors' realist interpretation initially suggesting a correspondence theory of truth, and their later emphasis on " the negotia- tion of accounts " coming closer to a coherence theory. The problem in part is that the authors see that their emphasis on the way the reasons for action emerge under challenge and under demands for justification runs the risk of suggesting experiments in which the investigator does not elicit the attitudes and beliefs of the person being questioned but changes them. The authors suggest that we have to content ourselves with an account of " the facts " which amounts to saying that they are what the participants and a spectator agree on between them. This somewhat unnerving view is backed up by the perfectly proper claim that even in the physical sciences accounts of the facts are always revisable in principle-though very differently. The authors do not seem quite certain whether or not this is enough to show that there is no differ- ence of principle between the natural and social sciences. They say, " The demand for final, absolutely unrevisable truth cannot be met in either field. In ethogeny it is not even viable as a theoretical ideal." But this is to leave the problem quite unsettled, besides leaving it equally unclear whether the contrast between the unattainable and the theoretically unviable is meant to carry much weight. One could, of course, go on for ever about this contrast and the difficulty of either clarifying or dissolving it. At the very least Harre and Secord deserve the thanks of their readers for contributing an account of the problems of explaining human behaviour which any writer on the philosophy of the social sciences now has to negotiate with.
