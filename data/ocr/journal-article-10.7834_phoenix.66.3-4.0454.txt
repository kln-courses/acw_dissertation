When the evidence is not contemporary, there seems no reason to restrict the amount of change that may have taken place, or to suppose that the consulship was one static element in an otherwise rapidly developing and dynamic state. University of Wales, Trinity Saint David J. H. Richardson Religion in Republican Rome: Rationalization and Ritual Change. By JoÈrg RuÈpke. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press. 2012. Pp. vi, 336. It was during the republic that the definitive form of Roman religion took shape. We can see its formidable, unpredictable shadow cast on Augustan and imperial Rome, but the edifice casting the shadow is almost entirely beyond our line of vision. The cause is twofold: first, there is a near-total absence of a written record for the early and middle republic; and second, there is also an absence, to a quite devastating degree, of the remains of this same period’s material culture. The absence of evidence is not evidence for absence, patently so in this case, but our position in understanding the development, not to mention the physical context, of early republican religion is undeniably precarious. Jo ̈rg Ru ̈pke’s most recent volume, Religion in Republican Rome, invites a renewed and vigorous scholarly discussion of religion for this period. Ru ̈pke has adopted Max Weber’s theories, with their emphasis on “systemization” of religion, and the development of rational-legal authority, both of which predicate a social motivation for introducing changes in religious practice. This suits Ru ̈pke’s (and most Roman historians’) interest in elite control, and the “pragmatic and political aspects of the history of religion” (43). Always keeping within a larger chronological framework, Ru ̈pke approaches his subjects through innovative thematic analyses; initially, and very productively, through the theme of religion as communication. In processions and dramas performed at festivals, he argues, the religious and historical communication was from the upper class, the victors, the elite, to the passive assembled Roman citizenry. The greater part of his analysis, however, is structured around the dichotomy of pa- tricians and plebeians. It is through this dichotomy that Ru ̈pke tracks the changes in Roman religion, and Roman efforts to manage the complex inherited traditions of reli- gion in light of these changes, from the fifth through the third century. He examines poetry recited at upper class banquets: not ballads, but historical epic, which provided an elevated, Greek-influenced, and exclusive means of communication between members of the elite. From the third century on he focuses on the need of the newly integrated plebeian aristocrats to communicate among themselves as well as with the existing up- per class, and on the resultant proliferation of festivals and opportunities for religious banquets. He points out how this growing, but still exclusive, communication facilitated increasing competition, and turned it outward toward public activity. This activity can be seen as early as the fourth century, he argues, when increasing numbers of honorific statues were bestowed upon the city by ambitious men, and the triumphator made his first appearance. Ru ̈pke brings new analysis to each of these topics, and also takes particular care to situate his analysis in a social context. (He argues for instance that the triumphator’s red-painted face was an imitation of, and deliberate replacement for, a personal honorific terracotta statue; this is strikingly original, yet one does wonder about the first general who agreed to be paraded as a statue of himself in lieu of erecting a real one.) Whether </page> <page sequence="2"> BOOK REVIEWS/COMPTES RENDUS 455 one agrees with Ru ̈pke or not, it is an advantage that his Weberian approach makes religion inherently part of Roman society. Changes occurred in the world of real people, as a result of these people taking deliberate actions. Two major issues of scholarly concern—the calendar and the use of writing—he deals with decisively. He takes the calendar entirely out of the realm of religion, which reflects in part his understanding of the slow development of writing, and of writing as public communication, in Roman society. By locating Roman religion in a society that wrote, but did not use writing for public record until the third century, he codifies an emerging scholarly consensus and highlights the anomaly: just enough evidence to show that public writing was known, yet too little of it to confirm that it was actually, let alone regularly, used. Ru ̈pke rightly notes that the Capitoline temple of Jupiter, among the largest in the Mediterranean at the time, is evidence for Roman religious competition in the wider archaic world. With a population of perhaps 30,000 (and growing) at the end of the sixth century, Rome was already then emerging as a wealthy and religiously multifaceted power in central Italy. In greater or lesser numbers, Etruscans, Latins, Italians, Carthaginians, and Greeks all traded, worked, and lived in Rome, representing the nodes of various networks, as Irad Malkin argues, that allowed the flows of cultural content to proliferate.1 Philip Sapirstein’s work on the monumental archaic limestone and terracotta temple in Corfu of the seventh century suggests that the mid-Italic temple form (of which the Capitoline temple was a major example) arose through just such a network linking archaic Italy, Magna Graecia, Corfu, Northwestern Greece, and Corinth.2 Why should Rome not be part of such a network? If Miletus in Asia Minor went into city-wide mourning at the fall of Sybaris to Croton in Magna Graecia (Hdt. 6.21), how could the Romans not have been aware of this defeat? If the Persian king Darius i in Susa knew the reputation of Democedes of Croton (Hdt. 3.129–137), surely the Romans, a fortiori, will have heard about Croton, Croton’s empire, and its religio-philosophical government? Having observed the Capitoline temple as evidence of international religious network- ing, Ru ̈pke leaves the matter for others to pursue. When he turns to the problem of authoritative communication in Rome before the second century, he raises the crucial question of how traditional religion and Roman identity were publicly defined and main- tained in a society without written public documents. It is a question well worth asking. When he moves on to the later republic, he demonstrates the value of looking in new places for our evidence. He uses an inscription from Urso, the Roman colony of Spain founded under Julius Caesar’s auspices in 44 b.c., to illuminate through a list of religious laws and priestly appointments the transition from republican to Augustan/imperial reli- gion. A comparable list from the charter of the Baetican municipium Flavium Irnitanum of almost two centuries later allows Ru ̈pke to trace the change to a “court religion” at Rome. Finally, two swift but intense chapters on Varro’s and Cicero’s works about religion demonstrate that, viewed through the lens of Weberian theory, these authors fail to achieve a Hellenized rationalization of religion. The argument is formidable, and the conclusion hard to resist, but it may be that Weberian theory is not quite as helpful here as elsewhere. This will be a matter for philosophers to thrash out.

To balance Weber, we may need anthropology, in the theories of Victor Turner (liminality, communitas) and Clifford Geertz (the semiotic concept of culture); or perhaps John Searle’s theories of speech act (for the republic before public writing) and its extension to performance act (for the third century and after).3 Religion, minimally, is a way of understanding and interpreting the universe and one’s place in it. The Romans had great confidence in their religion, whether or not they individually believed in augury, anthropomorphism, or specific rituals. The understanding and assumptions that gave rise to that confidence were, precisely, the object of all that elite competition. The study of Roman religion cannot be confined to its pragmatic and political aspects while ignoring religion itself. As compelling as Ru ̈pke’s conclusions can be, they are at times in danger of doing just that. University of Iowa Carin Green Imperial Ideals in the Roman West: Representation, Circulation, Power. By Carlos F. NorenÄa. Cambridge University Press: Cambridge. 2011. Pp. xxi, 456. NorenÄa takes as his central theme the question of how the change in Roman government from republic to monarchy related to the major cultural changes that occurred at about the same time in the Roman empire and especially in the Roman west. Syme argued that the switch to monarchy drove cultural change; more recent work on the subject tends to see the advent of monarchy as a product of broader developments in society. Noren ̃a proposes an alternative to these two viewpoints, one that seeks to explain these simultaneous changes “as the product of a more general convergence of ‘social power’ in the Roman world” (10). Noren ̃a defines “social power” (a term coined by the sociologist Michael Mann) as “control over territories, resources, and persons, and . . . . the manner in which such control is organized, both logistically and symbolically”; this power “is mainly collective and institutional instead of individual, and it is situated not within societies, but rather within sets of overlapping and interconnected networks” (322). The emperor was “the critical ‘node’ ” (323) for these networks and functioned as a “symbolic glue” (324) that replaced the pure force that had held the empire together during the republic. This led to “a measure of ideological unification between the multiple actors who controlled the main power networks of the Roman world” (324) and in turn to a more stable form of government. This concept of the role of the emperor as an ethical and beneficent entity is central to the book. Noren ̃a’s main thesis is that the emperor was systematically depicted as a “moral exemplar,” who “not only reinforced the power of the Roman state . . . but also increased the collective authority of the local aristocracies upon which the empire’s social and political order was based” (1). The core of the book is an attempt to prove this thesis by studying the iconography of the imperial coinage, based on the idea that this material 3For example, V.
