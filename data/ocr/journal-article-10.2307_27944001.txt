(Reviewed by J. Wesley Robbins, Indiana University South Bend.) obert Corrington claims much for his philosophy of ecstatic naturalism. XVIt marks, he says, "a fundamental turning point within philosophy and theology" (EN, 15). It is "that moment within naturalism when it recognizes its self-transcending character" (EN, 18). Corrington portrays this momentous event in the history of philosophy as a product of the confluence of the revival of classical American pragmatism, the transformation of previous forms of naturalism into an ecstatic naturalism that recognizes the depth dimension of nature, and the emergence of postmodern psychoanalysis. In Corrington's estimation an aberrant strain, "so-called neopragmatism," infects the first of these strands. He says, "The current revival of pragmatism must return to the classical sources and avoid the misguided perspectivalism of neopragmatism" (EN, 5). Corrington cites Cornel West in this connection as a neo-pragmatist who stresses "pluralism and linguistic relativism to the detriment of the deeper metaphysical impulses that animated pragmatism and Peircean pragmaticism" (EN, 4). William Dean is another culprit. "The recent concern with showing that pragmatism is actually a form of postmodernism [a concern Corrington takes to be exhibited in various of Dean's works] is but one manifestation of the confusions surrounding the revival of pragmatism" (EN, 4). Neo-pragmatic humanists like Richard Rorty and myself are the worst offenders. We are guilty of the unpardonable sin of "glottocentrism " Our neo pragmatism is "anthropocentric and tied to the images and metaphors of one 347</page><page sequence="2">348_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ particular, and highly idiosyncratic, sign-using organism."1 Corrington proclaims that this contemporary revision of Deweyan humanism is "a metaphysical dead end, and in this sense, a hidden cousin of the postmodernist left (Derrida et. al.)."2 In this critical review I will outline salient features of Corrington's ecstatic naturalism, detail his principal objections to neo-pragmatism, and consider the merits of those objections. My thesis is that Corrington's criticisms of neo-pragmatism are ill-informed and, thus, without merit. Consequently, his claim to be the voice of a culminating naturalism that supersedes all other sorts of religiously inclined naturalism is something less than compelling. Whatever the merits of his objections to versions of theistic naturalism other than his own may be, once his misunderstandings of neo pragmatism are exposed, Deweyan humanism stands as a viable, and I suggest preferable, naturalistic religious alternative to Corrington's ecstatic naturalism. Nature, according to Corrington's metaphysical account of it, is a bifurcated messaging system. It is, on the one hand, a relatively settled system composed of more or less definite signs jockeying with one another for places in semiotic space. This is nature natured, the encompassing natural world with its innumerable orders. Nature, on the other hand, is something other than any definite sign or organized system of signs. It is an unsettled and unsettling generator of signs. This is nature naturing, the presemiotic "birthing ground" that ejects the signs which make up the natural order. Corrington populates his natural world with a zoo of momenta and vectors. These carry the principal theological weight in his system. For example, the presemiotic realm of nature naturing is "the momentum of pulsation that generates an endless stream of signs and symbols...." (EN, 27). Or, there is "a hidden vector force within betweenness that moves from the ultimate split within nature to the plenitude of the archetypes" (EN, 158). Yet again, the spirit "is not an intentional agent. . . [but] one of nature's most important momentums "3 It is "a field of enabling energy" that "provides for 1 Robert Corrington, "Beyond Experience: Pragmatism and Nature's God," American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy 14/2 (May 1993), 159. 2 Ibid. 3 Robert Corrington, Nature's Self: Our Journey from Origin to Spirit (Lanham: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 1996), 52.</page><page sequence="3">_Vol. 17, No. 3, September 1996 _349 an enhancement of all sign systems and all conscious sign users."4 These vectors conspire "to increase the plenitude of the semiotic world" (EN, 158). The upshot of all of this is that "While finite meanings come and go, the ultimate directionality of world semiosis is toward a gradual increase in the 'amount' of meaning in the world" (EN, 174). Human sign users thus operate in a natural world that is already in the messaging business. "The human process actualizes semiotic processes that it did not make and that it did not shape. Our cultural codes ... are what they are by riding on the back of this self-recording nature" (EN, 180). Consequently, human sign users need to be oriented properly to the antecedent messaging system in which we are located. Speaking of his agreement with Robert Neville in this regard, Corrington says that both of them acknowledge "the status of the world as a kind of ultimate dynamic object compelling human interpretative acts toward a measure which is extrahuman" (EN, 24). Further, Corrington claims that "no answer to our queries remains compelling ifit is not attuned to the perennial rhythms of world semiosis and to the sheer scope of a nature that has no obligations to the human process" (EN, 64). Our highest calling as sign users is "attunement with the depth rhythms of world semiosis" (EN, 60). As Corrington sees it, his philosophy of ecstatic naturalism is the instrument whose ultimate purpose is "to realign the human process with the depth structures and potencies of nature."5 To the extent that ecstatic naturalism successfully focuses our attention on the ontological bifurcation in nature, Corrington says, "it will realign thought so that the return of ultimate meaning can come out of the elusive spirit at the heart of nature" (EN, 15). In Corrington's account, humans are not devices whose greatest accomplishment is the formation of accurate internal representations of the formal structure of the world. Our higher calling is participation. Humans are devices "designed," as it were, to pick up and resonate with rhythms emanating from the depths of nature so that our lives will follow the course of the "ultimate directionality of world semiosis" (EN, 175). Whether representing or participating, Corrington agrees with the classical philosophical tradition that the greatest human accomplishment is to 4 Ibid., 144. 5 Ibid., 136.</page><page sequence="4">350_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ be properly oriented to the antecedent originating principles of nature. In Corrington's version, our lives derive whatever real significance they have, and whatever salvation there is available, from being properly adjusted to the antecedent messaging system of nature, particularly its depth dimension and the momenta generated from there. Apart from this "ultimate dynamic object," we are lost. Corrington's ecstatic naturalism is a contemporary example of what Dewey called Europe's "regnant philosophy for the past two thousand years." The depths of nature is Corrington's replacement for the Platonic Good. It is the condition of possibility that lends compellingness to those of our practices, scientific and moral, properly attuned to it and its rhythms. As in traditional Platonic-Christian philosophy, the same principle grounds both our science and morals. This philosophy and its view of human mentality, as the capacity that is to properly orient us to the antecedent order and/or rhythms of nature, is the one that Dewey himself and his contemporary neo-pragmatic followers want to replace. In an attempt to separate Dewey from contemporary neo-pragmatists, Corrington claims him, along with Peirce, as "metaphysicians first and last" (EN, 5). Peirce aside, the Dewey who extended the logic of Darwinian biology into philosophy and applied it to human mentality, morals, and religion was not Corrington's kind of metaphysician. That Dewey rejected the notion that philosophy's chief role in society is to provide wholesale guarantees for the value of human practices by delineating their connection to nature's originating principles. Whatever else he may have meant by "metaphysics," Dewey most assuredly did not mean, as Corrington does, the discipline whose goal is the proper orientation of human practices to the originating principles and powers of nature so that ultimate value gets transferred from the latter to the former. That Dewey also rejected the traditional philosophical notion of human mentality as a tracker of antecedent reality in favor of an anticipatory, interest driven, problem-solving conception. There is no place in this conception of the human mind for Corrington's notion of differences in kind between thinking that attends to nature's determinate orders, on the one hand, and thinking that plumbs its primordial and indeterminate depths, on the other. Dewey explicitly disavowed any such hierarchical distinction between superficial and depth knowledge in favor of a temporal distinction between</page><page sequence="5">_Vol. 17, No. 3, September 1996_351 what passes for knowledge before and after the intervention of intelligent action, i.e., experimentation. This same Dewey also observed that the intelligent action interposed between older opinion and newer knowledge takes place most notably, so far as we know, on the part of human beings. Consequently, he counseled that we should recognize and celebrate our connections with the surrounding natural world. But, at the same time, we should pin our hopes for salvation on our own ability to act upon existing conditions in behalf of imagined ideals, rather than relying on powers located in the extra-human natural world to unify actuality with ideal values. The only way for Corrington to claim the Dewey I have just described as his kind of metaphysician is either to ignore these central themes of Dewey's work from his 1909 Darwin essay through A Quest for Certainty to A Common Faith or else to suppose that Dewey subsequently recanted them. Corrington says nothing to suggest that he subscribes to the latter supposition. Contemporary neo-pragmatists revise Dewey's humanism in one way. The mentality that he describes is linguistic through and through. The ability of humans to manipulate sounds and marks into sentences in a language evolved naturally by the same processes responsible, e.g., for producing the ability of birds to manipulate mud and twigs into nests. The meaning of what we say and think is a function of regularities in these manipulations of sounds and marks. Our mentality so construed is causally connected to the rest of the world. At bottom it is a matter of our being conditioned to be caused to hold certain sentences true when presented with appropriate things in our environment. Dewey was right. Our beliefs are true or false. But not because they represent, or resonate with, anything. Neo-pragmatists, like Dewey, take intellectual progress to be a temporal, not a hierarchical, matter. It has nothing to do with closer approximation either to the heights or to the depths of nature. Intellectual progress occurs, when it does, by the creation of new language, not by language more closely participating in antecedent principles or powers of nature. As with Dewey, contemporary neo-pragmatists observe that, so far as we know, the manipulation of sounds and marks into meaningful discourse occurs most notably on the part of human beings. We can and should recognize, and celebrate, our connections with the surrounding natural world.</page><page sequence="6">352_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ But there is no reason to suppose that those connections include likenesses between our linguistic abilities and the rest of the natural world, such that the latter lend authority to the former. In that respect, we are better off depending on our ability to generate new ways of talking and thinking than looking to extra-human natural powers to save us. This, of course, is the view of human relationship to the rest of the natural world that Corrington despises. The following quotation summarizes his disagreement with neo-pragmatism. Most semiotic perspectives assume that meaning is in and of human cultures and that it is tied directly to specific arbitrary codes that carry their own formal principles for encoding and decoding along and through specific channels of transmission. . . . Ecstatic naturalism is unrelenting in its drive to overcome the privileging of the human standpoint (a particular curse of postmodernist and structuralist forms of semiotic), while honoring the ways in which nature encompasses and enables the human process. At the same time it insists that meanings are in and of a self-transforming nature and that human cultural codes are merely one extreme manifestation of meaning. It is far more anthropocentric or anthropomorphic to confine meaning to culture than to probe into the innumerable enabling conditions within nature that sustain and generate meaning. (EN, 160) Apart form the reference to formal principles for encoding and decoding, Corrington is right about one thing. Neo-pragmatists do "confine meaning to culture." As I have already indicated, our account is explicitly anthropocentric, equating meaning with certain behavioral regularities found to occur most commonly among human beings. Unfortunately, Corrington systematically mistakes the implications of this account of meaning. He concludes, for example, that neo-pragmatism is a version of idealism which makes signs out to be free from nature. Neo-pragmatists insist that the ability of humans to manipulate sounds and marks into meaningful sentences is the product of exactly the same sorts of physical, chemical, biological processes responsible for the behavioral</page><page sequence="7">Vol 17, No. 3, September 1996 353 capacities of other organisms. We further maintain that humans exercise our linguistic abilities in constant causal interaction with the surrounding natural environment. Clearly, on this view, human sign users and interpreters are located in a surrounding natural world which we did not create. The fact that our linguistic signs have no precedents to follow in the natural world does not make them unconnected to that world. It makes them something other than representations of, or forms of participationin, the natural world, tools perhaps? Corrington assumes that any philosophy which denies that the natural world is already in the messaging business must, as a result, carry with it an idealistic denial of the supremacy of nature over history. Why suppose that? Why suppose, appearances to the contrary notwithstanding, that the natural world is in fact a system of signs antecedent to human language use? Because otherwise, Corrington believes, the successfulness of our language use would be inexplicable. "Our success as interpreters is made possible by the ancient semiotic processes of a self-recording nature that keeps many of its past signs alive in present configurations" (EN, 180). This is not naturalism. It is transcendentalism. Both James and Dewey explicitly renounced transcendental explanations of human mentality and its successes in terms of conditions of possibility in favor of a Darwinian explanation in terms of actual causal interactions between organisms and their environment. The latter, of course, explains our success as interpreters in terms of advantages that our linguistic abilities give us in coping with our environment rather than in terms of presumed likenesses between our language use and processes occurring in the rest of the natural world. Imagine a race of birds some members of which become interested in explaining the success of their ability to manipulate twigs and mud into nest. The transcendentalists among them insist that were the natural world not already in the nest building business, there would be no accounting for their successes. One such transcendentalist philosopher bird contends that when members of their race manipulate twigs and mud into nests, "the bird process" is actualizing nesting processes already pervasive in the natural world, processes that it did not make. Our nest building, he says, is what it is in virtue of its "riding on the back of the natural world's antecedent nest building. If pragmatism stands for anything philosophically, it is that transcendental</page><page sequence="8">354_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ explanations of this sort are as pointless in the human case as they are in the bird case. The fact that the neo-pragmatist view of human mentality and its relationship to the rest of the world is utterly Darwinian does not deter Corrington. He still accuses us of the twin sins of denying "the supremacy of nature over history" and of fostering an imperialistic attitude by writing the unique features of human beings "too large on the face of nature," thus overprivileging "human forms of manipulation and control" (EN, 54). In Corrington's book, Dewey was already guilty of these things. He erred, says Corrington, "in driving instrumental and anthropocentric categories too far into the orders of nature?" (EN, 20) Given Dewey's explicit denial of hierarchical notions of the relationship between human mentality and nature, it is difficult even to make sense of this charge that his instrumentalist account of this relationship drives something "too far into" nature. Take Isaac Newton's experiments with light as an example. In Dewey's account of this episode in the history of science, the difference between common sense opinions and scientific knowledge about light is a temporal one, with Newton's experimentation sandwiched in between the earlier and later states of human belief. Clearly, this difference and the gains enjoyed in consequence of it has nothing to do with Newton's ideas about light more closely plumbing the depths of nature than preceding ideas did. Human mentality goes no further into the natural world, in either the common sense or the scientific case, than the actual effects of human experimental behavior. And that is the point. When Dewey portrays human mentality in instrumental terms, the idea is not that we somehow make the rest of nature over into a reflection of ourselves. It is that our thinking and talking are special cases of behavioral interactions between ourselves and the natural environment. The reach of human thought, understood in these neo-pragmatist terms, does not and cannot exceed the grasp of the actual effects of our behavior. Corrington might as well say, in the bird case, that their nest building needs to be limited by nest building processes already pervasive in the natural world. Otherwise, their manipulation of mud and twigs into nests would be free to remake the natural world over into a reflection of themselves, unchecked by anything that they had to answer to. This makes no more sense</page><page sequence="9">_Vol. 17, No. 3, September 1996_355 in the human case than it does in the bird case. Humans cannot drive anything "deeper" into nature by our linguistic behavior than birds can by their nest building behavior In the neo-pragmatist view, the nest building abilities of birds and the linguistic abilities of humans are no different from one another when it comes to the relationship of those abilities to the rest of the world. Both involve causal interactions between behavior on the part of the respective organisms and their environment, no more, no less. The Kantian view of meaning provides one of the clearest examples of the imperialistic attitude that Corrington wants to avoid. If we were to suppose that the natural world is, as Kant claimed, a phenomenal realm constituted by our imposing an organizational scheme on a given experiential content, then it would make some sense to claim that this intellectual self image carries with it a dominative "master of the universe" attitude. Unfortunately for Corrington's purposes, neo-pragmatists explicitly deny that the relationship of human mentality to the rest of the world involves any such imposition of an organizational scheme on a content. If, as we say, meaning is nothing more nor less than regularities in our linguistic behavior, then when we think and talk there is no constitutive activity on our part a la Kant by which we impose a world order. There is only one species using the behavioral resources at its disposal to get along as best it can. For anyone who holds this intellectual self-image, a "master of the universe" attitude on our part toward the rest of the world is a joke, and a bad one at that. We neo-pragmatists have to admit that the effects of human behavior on the natural environment may be, and have been, devastating. We do not have to admit that our view of mentality has humans imposing order upon, or exercising dominion over, anything. There is no connection between the neo-pragmatist anthropocentric account of meaning and "the imperial self." I conclude with two objections of my own to Corrington's philosophy of ecstatic naturalism. The first is that it is a form of metaphysical dualism papered over by applying the term "nature" to both sides of the so-called ontological difference. By his account, the natural world comes from something, its presemiotic ground, that itself has no physical description. This is not significantly different from the classical supernaturalist claim that the physical world comes from a God who has no physical description. By my count, if the natural world of physical objects and processes located in space</page><page sequence="10">356_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ and time originates from something that itself has no physical, spatio-temporal characteristics whatever, then we are dealing with two distinct worlds, not one. My second objection is to Corrington's repeated references to humans as "the human process." This is an affectation. Its purpose is to emphasize the purported disinterestedness of his portrayal of human beings as just one more order within "the innumerable orders of nature." Corrington's claim to portray nature itself and our place in it in a way that transcends human interests is less than convincing. He describes a natural world that just so happens already to have one of the most distinctive features of human beings, the ability to come up with and manipulate signs. Corrington's ecstatic naturalism serves a fear that lies behind all idealistic philosophies. This is the fear that something we humans have gotten to be quite good at in the course of evolutionary history, sending and receiving messages in this case, would lose its value unless the natural world itself were already good at that. Not all of us have this fear. Some of us are committed to living in fruitful harmony with nature, unconcerned whether our intellectual abilities mimic processes that are already operative in the natural world. Our concern is to prize linguistic innovation in the course of human interaction with the natural environment. Our practiced ways of coping with the environment started with linguistic innovators in our past. Future improvement of those practices will come, when it does, from other such innovators. For we humanistic naturalists, Corrington's ecstatic naturalism is a relic, ingenious perhaps, but a throwback nonetheless to philosophies that prize linguistic recording over linguistic innovation.</page></plain_text>
