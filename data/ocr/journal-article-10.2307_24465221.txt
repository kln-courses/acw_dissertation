<plain_text><page sequence="1">72 MILTON QUARTERLY Reading God Reading "Man": Hereditary Sin and the Narrativization of Deity in Paradise Lost, Book 3 J. Allan Mitchell It is natural that hereditary sin should be at issue in John Milton's Paradise host vis-a-vis the poem's apologetic concern. Notable is the fact, however, that the ontological question remains inexplicit throughout the poem. Milton is prin cipally focused on the immediate "cause" that "Moved our grand parents" "to fall off / From their Creator" (1.28—31), not on the effects of that transgression upon future generations. Milton sought to explicate sin as an historical event first, in other words, and only thereby does he address original sin as the universal legacy of the human condition. The poet is accordingly preoccupied with demonstrating the individual responsibility of the first human couple, within a specific histor ical moment, on the more or less credible and eminently traditional assumption that the Fall story in all its narrative particularity will explain human history in general. Yet we are liable to come away from the poem feeling that with res pect to the damning hereditary condition the de facto effect does not follow self-evidently or justifiably from the cause, since as we know indi vidual responsibility is not predicable of the inborn corporate sin future generations fall heir to. The manifestly irresponsible behaviour of the Miltonic deity intensifies the problem, leaving readers of the poem uncertain as to the ultimate soundness of Milton's ontology on dramatic grounds, if no other. We are apt to be surprised by sin in this context, yet inadvertently so on Milton's part. I intend to investigate the issue of hereditary sin in Paradise Ij&gt;st by focusing my discussion on the presentation of deity in lines 56—415 of Book 3, wherein Milton's characterization and sequen tial narrativization of the Godhead puts in high relief the determination of the destiny of the human condition. It is the only book that allows the reader sustained access to God's omnific point of view, in his self-justification; it also con tains passages in which the consequences of the Fall for human ontology at large are in dispute. The Father, in dialogue with the Son, reaches a theological position on hereditary sin there, calling for reparatory grace, which putatively represents a proper providential response to the original sin he foresees. A fair way of assessing Milton's theo dicy is to compare the Father's forecast of events (the schematic outline of human history which forms the propositional or theological horizon of the narrative), upon which the deity bases his judgements and his authority, with the history the poem eventually transmits us (the fleshed-out details of Milton's Fall story). Reading God reading human history will permit us to regard Milton's approach to the problem of hereditary sin, and subsequently enable us to expose the demonic side of the deity which contaminates the views Milton would have his readers approve. My reading locates an instance of the funda mental fissure in the text between ideological design and aesthetic achievement, or between what critic C. Q. Drummond, in an excellent but little known series of articles which follow up on A. J. A. Waldock's famous assessments, has aptly called "theological demands" and "narrative de mands" (11.50).1 In other words, the narrative</page><page sequence="2">MILTON QUARTERLY 73 texture and mimetic quality of the poem con sistently confound and not infrequendy disqualify the ideological structure which subtends it. As I will indicate, a critical instance of the fissure manifests itself in Milton's representation of God: the Father is presented as a peculiar personality, behaving, and I think misbehaving, in a time bound narrative medium suitably biblical in its literalism. Milton's God has been conferred a bio graphy and a psychology, as well as a voice, and such particularizing characterological traits tend to undermine idealist and ideological claims that pertain to providence. In effect, by presenting his deity in propria persona as a kind of Old Testa ment almighty God, or a Homeric champion, rather than as a distant and numinous presence, "Milton opens the door to attitudes other than those relevant only to omnipotence and omni science" (Drummond 11.53). Such is the result of reading God in narrative context; the decisive complex of problems will reveal itself upon observing God reading "Man." This term, used inclusively by the Father in reference to archetypal action or to the general theological facts of the human condition, delineates the scope of his understanding of the historic Fall. Yet such in clusivity and univocity of reference is rendered extremely problematic in view of the indivi duation of one man and one woman in the narrative event, thus impugning the theological substructure presupposed by categorical God-talk of "man." In short, Milton's God, due to his own devastating misprision, betrays interests and atti tudes that imperil those theological proprieties he otherwise embodies. Now such a problematic state of affairs was surely achieved in Milton by default and not by design. Consequently, the larger problem I diagnose here centers on the now critical commonplace disjunction between intention and effect in Milton's work, for as many critics before me have noted the poet's aesthetics is not invariably consonant with his apologetics. The problem is I think essentially representa tional, to the extent that the literal narrative Milton recounts exerts unforeseen pressures upon the intended polemical function of his under taking. In any case, the question of hereditary sin can hardly be answered without due consideration of the matrix of problems affecting Milton's literary practice. It is right to start by reassessing what sort of deity Milton's God is, or is meant to be. Is the Father of Paradise Last a kind of pure spirit: Is he "Total Being, the Primal Energy, the Voice of Reason, the Moral Law ... the Creator who by intention brings into being others who act of themselves, and consequently the Intelligence that comprehends the universe" (234), as Irene Samuel long ago claimed? When first we meet him in Book 3, the Father indeed appears as the unfathomable and unlimited deity of the philoso phers and the mystics, magisterially ensconced like Neoplatonic Oneness itself in secrecy beyond human comprehension. God, impressively bend ing down "his eye, / His own works and their works at once to view" (3.58—59), is first pre sented commanding the temporal world from his unique otherwordly perch. Critics besides Samuel have tried to maintain such an elevated view of the deity, as invisible and inaccessible, throughout (Swaim 466; Lieb 234). But that is not nearly the whole story, for as we read on we encounter a deity neither inaccessible nor abstract, but dis tinctly anthropomorphic, individual, vocal, and to all appearances mutable. So while the deity does boast the impersonal, diagrammatic qualities the narrator and the critics ascribe to him, the Father as epic character turns out to be much more (or less) than an assembly of abstract functions, religious platitudes, or articles of faith. Indeed, that the Miltonic God boasts about himself at all might tend to compromise his metaphysical purity. In a similar vein, as one critic remarks, "it demeans the godhead to be delivering his own communiques and running commentary" (Hale 60). Yet Milton does not forbear to describe God in purely conceptual terms. Milton has the angels sing God "Omnipotent, / Immutable, Immortal, Infinite, / Eternal King ..." (3.372-74). Now how does the formal side of Milton's theology represented by the angels cope with a God who is immanent in narrative, incarnate in epic character? On the other hand, how does the characterization of God consist with abstract propositions that require him to maintain his notional integrity? I want to contend that Milton's anthropomorphism, legitimate though it is ac cording to the theory of accommodation, ends up scandalizing the venerable conceptual accouter ments the poet inherits from systematic theology,</page><page sequence="3">74 MILTON QUARTERLY putting in jeopardy his apologetic design in particular where it touches the demonstration of a credible human ontology. A consideration of the debate in heaven shows us where the problem arises most acutely, for over the course of the debate the reader witnesses a rather severe and pitiless deity coming to incorporate the sym pathetic entreaties of his benevolent Son, based on an understanding of historical events which have yet to transpire. The structure of the episode invites a literal interpretation that takes into account both the processual, educative nature of the debate and its hermeneutic relationship to the complicated Fall story which follows it. But an objection to a literal reading has to be answered before proceeding further in this interpretation. The objection has to do with the manner of reading God. According to both the Father and the critics who would defend him, salvation was the deity's plan all along: it was after all his "Eternal purpose" (3.172) to offer grace to the couple and to their progeny. Now if we believe in this eternal purpose, then the Father is and always has been as compassionate as the Son. Should we not then rule out in advance any reading of the debate qua argumentative process or dramatic unfolding because it is presumably not a literal depiction of a divine determination anyway? The narrative, in this view, would need to be de mythologized, anthropomorphism derhetoricized. Traditionally, critics who defend Milton's God press hard on the point claiming that the Son's probing questions merely provide the occasion for the Father to vocalize his gracious, immutable intention. Yet such critics are, in effect, presum ing to occupy an omniscient vantage outside and above the current of discourse that is constitutive of Milton's narrative presentation of deity.2 God is vindicated thereby only by ignoring the force and texture of the narrative, invalidating the authenticity of our reading experience and the evidentiary nature of the debate. This last point is crucial, and will require some further elaboration, for it is by the very means of mimesis and sequential, dialectical process that Milton has sought to persuade us. Certainly, in Milton's work the processes of coming-to-meaning are not to be subordinated to a prior faith in an eternal perspective, a perspec tive proffered by a single character (even if he is God) at a specific juncture in the narrative. It is important to realize that the Father can only have the first and last word if the integrity of his character is already taken to be axiomatic, that is, we would have to be assured of his "eternal purpose" before we could be certain his speeches presuppose it. But that would be to concede far too much, namely the very Christian faith readers are not yet supposed to be in full possession of. Another way of pointing up this question-begging paradox is to say that if we postulate God's goodness in advance of Milton's depiction of the deity, then the poet's particular theodicy is made otiose; there is no need for arguments. The strangeness of the situation is indeed instructive, though it is probably one that Milton's defenders would nevertheless sanction. Granted, it is not unreasonable to suppose that Milton himself wished to install such an axiom in the text. It is just that, in this debate scene as throughout the whole poem, Milton's theological axioms are being put to the test, as indeed it is precisely the Father's intentions and his integrity which are in dispute at the beginning of Book 3. It is ana lytically presumptive, not to say somewhat dis ingenuous, to appeal to foundational theological categories and divine attributes external to the narrative itself, unless of course the integrity and eternity of God's intentions are already pre determined by dogma.3 The truth of the justice of God, far from being a doctrinal datum in the poem, must rather be achieved on Milton's part by deliberate persuasion. If we can succeed in laying aside theological biases, such as the assumption that God must be good or that his word safely transcends the contingencies of narrative and time, then a priori propositional statements (such as "my Eternal purpose") may properly be left open to complex qualification according to their various contexts. Since Milton's God dwells with us in the temporal flow of narrative, it is within that medium that he should have to be justified. In his effort to justify the ways of God to men, Milton himself would be the first to recognize the human, cognitive exigency and thus avoid the vicious circle alluded to in the previous paragraph: Immediate are the acts of God, more swift Than time or motion, but to human ears</page><page sequence="4">MILTON QUARTERLY 75 Cannot without process of speech be told, So told as earthly notions can receive. (7.176-79) The integrity and immediacy of the divine purpose is complicated but also made intelligible only by means of its setting in the "process of speech," the time-bound medium of narrative, where it accommodates human understandings. Thus our "earthy notions" are not illegitimate.4 This brings us back to the original question of how to read God in the narrative event. As Milton says elsewhere: It is safest for us to form an image of God in our minds which corresponds to his repre sentation and description of himself in the sacred writings We ought not to imagine that God would have said anything or caused anything to be written about himself unless he intended that it should be a part of our con ception of him. On the question of what is or what is not suitable for God, let us ask for no more dependable authority than God himself. (CD 133-34) We have good reason to embrace the dramatic level of the poem, and therefore to respond direcdy to the voice of Milton's anthropo morphic deity, who would never "ascribe to him self any property if he did not wish us to ascribe it to him" (CD 136).5 The poet goes on to reproduce many of the same anthropomorphic characteristics in the epic.6 The grounds for a literal interpretation of God in Paradise Lost having been made clear, it is time for a reading of the deity in situ. The Father, though he seems to some to be but a mouthpiece of "straightforward doctrine" (Danielson 105), is peculiarly placed by means of characterization and action in a narrative context, and this unique mimetic rendering in turn situates and infects the doctrine he communicates. In Book 3, Milton has the Father debate the particulars of divine providence with the Son.7 Specifically at issue in the colloquy is the relative applicability of mercy and justice to fallen Adam and Eve. The two disputants, the Father and the Son, appear to be on opposing sides of the issue: the Father makes a case for the severity of the law, the "rigid satisfaction" (3.212), while the Son pleads for redemption through grace. The Son daringly but diplomatically challenges the Father to be more compassionate, reasoning that it is "only right" (3.155) to extend absolute mercy to the beleaguered human couple and their progeny. Admittedly, the Father is the first to anticipate the possibility of Mercy: "in Mercy and Justice both, / Through Heav'n and Earth, so shall my glory excel, / But Mercy first and last shall brightest shine" (3.132—32). "Nevertheless," observesj. M. Evans, "the Father and the Son do still preserve the characteristics of their allegorical predeces sors. The demands of Justice are voiced primarily by the Father [quoting 3.210—12]. And the arguments of Mercy are given almost exclusively to the Son" (235). The critic thus reasons correctly: "the Father may assert that His mercy will eventually triumph and that Man will find grace, but it is in His Son that 'Divine compas sion visibly appeerd, / Love without end, and without measure, Grace'" ([3.141—42] 236). In these vestiges of allegory, inherited from a medieval tradition of representing the daughters of God arguing over the advisability of human salvation, we are apt to favour the Son over the Father. This is the usual modern response (Hughes 111). But related details converge to direct our sympathies away from the Father, unyielding in his desire for putative justice, the "rigid satisfaction," towards the compassionate but also more astute Son. The Father's self-justification is constituted by a number of propositions—for example, metaphysical claims, descriptions of history, and statements of intention—that jar with the primordial events as they are actually experienced and narrated.8 One observes, first of all, the Father's description of creaturely freedom and self-determination. Adam and Eve are supposedly Authors to themselves in all Both what they judge and what they choose; for so I form'd them free, and free they must remain, Till they enthrall themselves. (3.122-25) The Father is disclaiming responsibility for the Fall here, and it is revealing that he renders the</page><page sequence="5">76 MILTON QUARTERLY issue in terms of "authorial" mastery even despite his reference to his own formative influence; the deity positions himself as reader, implicitly dis avowing his own authority to become the mere recipient of a text produced by individuals with all the benefits of human agency. Yet closer scrutiny reveals that the abstract proposition about human autonomy depends upon the suppression of significant narrative details. There are in fact major discrepancies between the divine synopsis and the concrete narrated events of history, and this fact must reflect unfavourably upon the deity's character, as we shall see. The Father's theoretical pronouncements and historical judg ments, in other words, are in an interestingly complex but also seriously compromised rela tionship with his personality and the dramatic context he is responding to. In fact, God can be shown to be both an unreliable and an unin formed reader (or historiography), and not a little devious to boot.9 Late in the first speech, the Father's propo sition about autonomy is rightly qualified with reference to mitigating circumstance: one-third of the angels "by thir own suggestion fell, / Self tempted, self-depraved: Man falls deceiv'd / By th'other first," a very crucial distinction as it turns out, since based on that bit of circumstantial evidence the Father concludes, "Man therefore shall find grace, / The other none" (3.129-32). Human culpability is, as the discerning reader knows, thrown radically into question by the contexts that impinge on the peculiar Miltonic version of the Fall. One inevitably asks oneself whether Adam and Eve, if deceived by spiritual super-powers, were actually authors to themselves in all? In the dire event, could Adam and Eve have judged and chosen rightly? Milton's ren dering invites further queries about the dif ferences between Adam's and Eve's experiences, and whether distinctions ought to be made with respect to each individual's agency and culpability. I take it that Father's qualification alludes, if only inadvertently, to these same probative difficulties. Yet the Father's discourse ultimately evades evidentiary refinements such as those I would wish to introduce into any serious discussions of Milton's Fall. The Father willfully reduces the story to its most schematic outlines. He speaks like a competent theologian perhaps, but by no means as an informed reader of the story our poet tells. Though, to start with, it is notable that God does not even have his theology straight: Adam actually was "not deceived" (9.998), though Eve was (cf. I Timothy 2.11—15). But the Father prefers to generalize in his spurious account, eliding significant differences between Adam's and Eve's transgressions by means of what we might call an archetypal imposition of unitary meaning on divergent circumstance. The sub sumption of individual sins into one prototypical Sin is conventional enough (even if not strictly Pauline, or, for that matter, wholly Miltonic!), but it is a highly reductive response to this poet's narrative presentation of the Fall. This points to the aforementioned fissure that runs throughout Milton's poem, and which Drummond cogently critiques: "The Genesis myth says Man fell, that mankind is fallen, mankind embodied in its symbolical, representative first man. But this is a conception Milton denies himself by treating Adam and Eve as elaborately delineated charac ters in a complicated narrative" (III. 55). The Father, in his repeated use of the inclusive "Man" (3.90,129; 10.41) thereby takes for granted an abstract dogma and imposes an archetypal interpretation on the Fall that subsequent books go on to challenge and qualify in great detail.10 Ought we to trust a reader—even, or rather especially, if that reader is God—who interprets a story without a fair grasp of the details? Or to use an immediately pertinent metaphor: Is a just sentence possible if the correct evidence has not been admitted for inspection? Adam and Eve are, I contend, deprived of justice before their trial begins. The Father attempts to disavow responsibility for the Fall throughout, but because he blurs major distinctions pertaining to the actions of Milton's principal characters, he is apt to raise our suspicions. The special pleading begins eady in the first speech: the Father, foreknowing the results, promises that Satan "shall pervert" the human couple, "For Man will heark'n to his glozing Res" (3.92—93). One wonders what moti vations lie concealed behind such a blatant mis representation of the facts. Granted, Milton is again only answering to the theological imperative by having his God speak like a capable Christian</page><page sequence="6">MILTON QUARTERLY 77 dogmatist, yet the obfuscation of the facts is fi nally counter-productive. The periphrastic "Man will heark'n to his glozing lies" is insufficiently reductive, overly diagrammatic, given the com plexly contextualized account which lies before us. What is more, Satan's self-aggrandizing pre varication—"Man I deceived" (10.496), he boasts to his demonic cohorts—utilizes the same attenu ated rhetoric. That God and Satan similady misread the Fall, that a divine typological reading sounds the same as a satanic swagger, will not reassure us. Why is God corroborating his en emy's exaggerated rhetoric here? What reason does God have for promoting demonic propa ganda? One answer is that God is beneficently coopting Satanic rhetoric to turn it to good ends. Philip J. Gallagher argues as much when he says the Father is actually attributing deception to Adam only nominally, in a gracious gesture that includes man in woman's deception so that the man too will "find grace." "God," explains Galla gher, "condescends to verbal ambiguities to accuse Adam of falling deceived—but, unlike Satan, preveniently, for redemption's sake" (121). In this way, argues the critic, Milton (through God) generously ameliorates Adam's "heinous undeceived transgression" (120). This reading is doubtful for at least two reasons. First, if Adam can be promoted arbitrarily like this, then why are not the fallen angels shown the same mercy? Yet my query gives up too much ground, namely, the assumption that Adam's sin is in fact graver —somehow more "heinous"—than Eve's. I do not see how this is so. God is neither a very gracious nor sagacious reader if he can find no reason to extenuate man's guilt on the basis of Adam's behaviour alone. Whatever unhappy sig nificances may have been attached to it postmortem, Adam's behavior is from one com pelling point of view a "glorious trial of exceeding love" (9.961).11 A nominal predication of decep tion in Adam's case therefore seems unnecessary, even inequitable, given that an ameliorative element is already inherent in his singular "sin." One can go further. Disobedience is only incidental to both Adam's and Eve's transgres sions because each is trapped by the exigency of a circumstance not of their own devising. Surely, neither Eve nor Adam were—-to use the deity's heavy-handed ex cathedra description—"Affecting God-head" (3.206) when they fell; nor were they directly expressing ingratitude (3.97) to God in their respective actions. On the contrary, Satan is the real "ingrate" (5.811)—and the recurrence of the word here activates the comparison. Why does God conflate two highly indivi duated instances into a univalent exegesis? An explanation that is in keeping with Milton's characterization of God as a poor reader is that, in order for the deity fully to acquit himself as Creator of sinful creatures, he must represent Adam and Eve as prima facie free and self determining. Expedience requires tendentious generalizations such as these, hence talk of agency and autonomy in terms of "authorial" mastery. But like the term "ingrate," the word "author" recurs as well in various other complicating contexts, muddying the waters as to the question of who has ultimate mastery in the narrative of the Fall. The Father says Adam and Eve were "Authors to themselves in all / Both what they judge and what they choose." However, we know—and God admits this in the end—that Eve falls prey to a sophisticated programme of deception, devised and implemented by Satan, "the author of all ill" (1.381). Was Eve then really an author to herself both in what she judged and what she chose? Was she not rather the victim of Satan's "authorial" guile, diabolical mischief, and invincible hypocrisy—the latter of which neither angel nor human can penetrate (4.682—89)? Though Eve retained the power of choice to the end, we must, I think, remain ambivalent towards the value of free-will in a circumstance in which judgement is so impaired. Satan wove a persua sive story about the efficacy of the fruit, and this deprived Eve of right judgement; without right judgement, there can be no right choice (except fortuitously). Eve is thus deprived of meaningful agency by a superior author-figure who wrote the context of her Fall. So again, God is found to be misrepresenting, or at least ungenerously simpli fying, the specific facts of the case. Satan, if not entirely the "author and prime architect" (10.356) of the Fall (this according to Sin, whom we would expect to know) is nevertheless a major force that ought to be more fully reckoned in the divine accounting of Eve's "sin." God does allude to the satanic deception, yet overall the Father's im</page><page sequence="7">78 MILTON QUARTERLY perious, condemnatory rhetoric overwhelms studied consideration of context and intention. It seems the Father is not really interested in the events as they happened or in the complexity of human motivation; the Fall narrative is instead made palimpsestic to his prejudices. From the reader's point of view, then, the poet's iteration of the term "author" is capable of undermining the Father's version of history. The poetry indeed goes some way toward destabilizing the certainties of human authority and freedom and, consequently, of culpability. If Adam and Eve are "authors to themselves," yet Satan is called "author of evil" (6.262), and God is both "author of all being" (3.374) and "Author and end of all things" (7.591), then the whole question of human agency and autonomy threatens to slide into a state of indetermination, as indeed it does in Milton's magnificendy tensile recension of the Fall story. The verbal repetition invites us to make comparisons and to ask the difficult question: Who "scripted" the Fall? The Father is a chief suspect, given his "foreknowledge" of the event and his all-encompassing providence that super intends the "end of all things"; hence the neces sity of his own self-defense. Now it is just these sorts of casuistical dimin ishment of historical fact that the Son takes up in his tactful response to the Father in Book 3. As a representative of "Love without end," this figure of compassion will respond unfavourably to the Father's oppressively narrow view of jus tice—which is a false justice. In the Father's view, we recall, Justice and Mercy are separate issues; grace is not a juridical issue at all, but is wholly supererogatory to justice. The only purpose of Mercy is, in the Father's words, "my glory [to] excel" (3.133). This is the view he will hold to the very end, and it is one the Son will eventually be forced to comply with and accommodate his compassion to by volunteering to redeem human kind. For the moment, however, the Son aims at a radical revision of the divine jurisprudence by quietly redescribing Mercy as Justice: For should Man finally be lost, should Man Thy creature late so lov'd, thy youngest Son Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though join'd With his own folly? that be from thee far, That far be from thee, Father, who art Judge Of all things made, and judgest only right. (3.150-55) As Danielson puts it, the Son's "question is as blunt a challenge to divine benevolence and omnipotency as any posed by Empson" (84)! We observe, first of all, that the Son reemphasizes the at least partially extenuating presence of "fraud" in the Fall. In doing so, the Son strategically appropriates the Father's univocal rhetoric about "Man's" general deception to make a point about the genuine nature of Adam and Eve's plight: both man and woman, the Son subtly implies, have become archetypal casualties of spiritual warfare. The only just thing would be to recover the hostages. Indeed, what is summoned to the foreground of the Son's speech is an over whelming sense of human powerlessness in the face of cosmic conflict; humans are subject to the caprice of higher beings. The Father may, for example, lose "the whole Race of mankind" (3.161) to the Devil, or the deity may choose to "unmake" (3.163) the creation. But in either case, argues the Son, "So should thy [the Father's] goodness and thy greatness both / Be question'd and blasphem'd without defense" (3.165-66). What is plainly indefensible is the thought that God, who has the power and prerogative to save humankind, should exterminate humankind or fail to extricate humanity from the clutch of Satan. The Son's contextualizing of the Fall may also be taken to apply retrospectively to events leading up to it. Because God, knowing the con sequences, permitted Satan certain freedoms and a range of action, the onus is on the deity to remedy the situation. Again, Adam and Eve are presented as unwitting victims caught in the crossfire of someone else's feud. As we have just come through two books of Hell, in which were exposed the origins and preconditions of the Fall (i.e., we witness the devils urgently conspiring, as their "last hope" [2.416], to sabotage God's newest creation), we are as readers acutely aware of the cosmic backdrop to the Fall, and are primed to share the Son's views. If God does not save Adam and Eve (to say nothing of their innocent progeny), the deity will be censurable. The Son is in effect taking issue with the Father's earlier self-exculpating assertion ("nor can [Adam</page><page sequence="8">MILTON QUARTERLY 79 and Eve] justly accuse / Their maker, or their making, or their Fate" [3.113—14]): the Son boldly diffuses responsibility for the Fall among the empyrean participants in the war, blaming the maker, the making, and fate all at once. His trenchant reappraisal thereby ultimately collapses the Father's cherished distinction between Mercy and Justice. In the final analysis, it is "only right" that "Man should find grace" (3.145). This astonishing criticism of the Father's law cuts to the heart of the theological matter of Milton's poem: are God's ways going to be defensible? What is of greatest interest for the purposes of my argument is how the question hinges precisely on the determination of the fate of human nature: is original sin as a universal human condition a just outcome of the original transgression? According to the Son, God's ways are just if and only if universal salvation is extended to "the whole Race," for all of humanity are in reality held hostage by spiritual powers. The Son is thus made to suggest that Original Sin as a primal condition never should have been ascribed to human creatures: "For should man finally be lost," queries an exasperated Son, "should man / Thy creature late so loved, thy youngest son / Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though join'd / With his own folly?" The implication, not difficult to draw from the speech, is that the Fall should not be predicated of the behaviour of Adam and Eve at all. Either they and their progeny should be exonerated, or universal salvation should auto matically apply. The use of the inclusive "man" here assists in the equivocation, and now it is in humanity's favour. In any event, one observes that nothing has yet been said about limiting grace to those "who will" (3.173)—thatvri!\ be the Father's stringent proviso, a compromise with and an innovation on the Son's original uncon ditional soteriology. From the Son's vantage point, though, given what he has said so far, the Father's innovation regarding election will have to seem like a compromise of justice itself. Are we then to conclude, then, that the Father's justice is no justice at all? Or, at least in particular, that hereditary sin is unjust? The Son has made a compelling case on juridical grounds for absolute mercy as justice, a yardstick against which all subsequent positions may I think be measured. The Father, for all the commendatory rhetoric of his response, does not seem to notice the Son's substantive redescription of Mercy, nor does he seem to have understood the Son's vigorous stand on salvation. Or if he does, then the deity recognizes only those elements that suit him: "All hast thou spok'n as my thoughts are" (3.171), intones the Father, which shows just how bra zenly self-absorbed he can seem to be. He has not registered the Son's radical position, as sub sequent behaviour indicates. The Father's eternal purpose turns out to be quite different from, and far less charitable than, the Son's original pro posal, though the deity evidently incorporates some elements of the other's soteriology into the final scheme. Yet I finally want to suggest that he incorporates the Son's beneficence only in appearance, to camouflage what may well be quite baneful motives and a savage appetite for destruction. The Father sets up a totalitarian system of redemption, one that is by theological standards quite orthodox and perhaps even sensible in the abstract, but that looks conspicuously like a cruel shell-game in the particular narrative context and among the personages involved. The system necessitates the utmost in human effort— creatures must "pray, repent, and bring obedience due" (3.190)—while it denies human beings the efficacy of their effort So far, standard Calvinist dogma. Yet by equivocating on the place of the "will" in salvation ("Man shall not quite be lost, but sav'd who will, / Yet not of will in him, but grace in me" [3.173-74]), the Father, because he is not merely a neutral or dispassionate mouth piece, sounds authoritarian.12 It appears as though he wants to have it both ways, demanding strict devotion from his subjects even while he takes all the credit for the fidelity of the relationship. Perhaps the Father has built into his soteriological scheme an ego-boosting mechanism that makes tolerable (what is for him) an unwilling sus pension of full justice; perhaps what gratification this deity forgoes by not executing the death penalty he regains by humiliating his creatures. Such conjectures are borne out by the foregoing characterization of the Father, as he is at once unyieldingly severe in respect to justice and blithely self-indulgent in respect to mercy. The Father's psychology surfaces quite clearly in the middle section of the second speech:</page><page sequence="9">80 MILTON QUARTERLY Upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand On even ground against his mortal foe, By me upheld, that he may know how frail His fall'n condition is, and to me owe All his deliv'rance, and to none but me. (3.178—82; emphasis added) Apart from the Father's betrayal of a relentless self-regard, what makes his speech suspect here (as opposed to if it were rendered as an expos itory passage in a treatise de doctrina Christiana) is the fact that the Son has just exposed as falla cious, or at best immaterial, the mercy vs. justice dichotomy. The Son took much if not all of the lustre away from grace, implying that redemption is nothing to boast about. Yet the Father does just that, remaining fanatical about his own munificence, which of course almost by definition makes any such claim dubious. The egomaniacal nature of the Father's arrangement is made most apparent in the discussion of what he will do to those who "will" not be saved (even where salvation does not depend on the individual will!): "... hard be hard'n'd, blind be blinded more, / That they may stumble on, and deeper fall; / And none but such from mercy I exclude" (3.200—03). Why such vindictiveness? God evidently has a deeply personal-interest in, and is seriously affected by, his creatures' attitudes toward him. This is indeed Milton's view of divine passibility (Lieb 223 et passim). The Father is an "incensed Deity" (3.187), a God of "anger" and "wrath" (3.263 64). But insofar as he has these familiar emotional responses, it is fair to inquire further into the psychology that generates this latest retaliatory impulse. And it can only be a troubled psychology that invents such barbarous punishments which serve to deprive dissidents of their capacity even to make amends; the offense is the more egre gious for being divine. The Father's merciless bullying of the damned (damned by God's will, not by their own) seems thus to be a kind of childish fury directed against those who refuse to fix their attention on him. If Milton's God is a jealous God, then he is a tyrannical adolescent with just enough intelligence to figure out how best to gratify his desires. How else explain "He with his whole posterity must die, / Die hee or justice must" (3.209-10) except as an evil plot engineered to keep generations of humanity in thrall to the deity's voracious ego? There is some thing about human guilt that, from God's point of view, contributes to the most favourable, providential state of affairs. The now arbitrary attribution of guilt evidently fuels a system of exploitation that gratifies the deity's ego-ideal; humanity's penal condition contributes to God's well-being. But there is one more way in which the Father obtains his "rigid satisfaction," even while claim ing to hand out grace freely, and that is by subjecting the Son to torture, a sadistic trick that again allows the deity to exercise "justice" at the very moment that he appears most gracious. For the Son's voluntary intercession looks like the Father's grace, when it is actually an expression of his vengeance. Things would probably have been different were Milton an orthodox trinitarian. But as William Empson pointed out long ago, Milton's antitrinitarianism vitiates the sanctity and simplicity of the crucifixion, transforming it from a kenotic self-sacrifice to a delegated sacrifice.13 The Son, not identical to the Father in Milton's heterodox Arian view, is deputed to mediate on God's behalf. Consequently, the mediation does not involve the deity himself in suffering as it would have had the Father been coessential with the Son.14 In effect, the heroism or humiliation of the crucifixion is now displaced from the deity to one of his subordinate creatures, the Son; the atonement is therefore not necessarily an expres sion of the deity's condescending grace. At the very least, what Milton's heterodoxy opens up here is the possibility that the Father's motives are not identical to the Son's. Such are the perhaps unforeseen implications of antitrinitarianism, but they are not confined to the pages of the theo logian's treatise; they are reflected on the mimetic level of Milton's poem, in which Father and Son are presented as individuated characters and not as an abstract or hypostatic unity. The Son is finally coerced into accepting the mercy vs. justice dichotomy, a false dichotomy that as we have seen enables the Father to compel his creatures to worship him on the one hand, and, on the other, to receive all the credit for an allegedly supererogatory redemption. The Son therefore sacrifices himself to save humankind (or those whom the Father will admit) from Death.</page><page sequence="10">MILTON QUARTERLY 81 Interestingly enough, the Son identifies Death as both a Satanic offspring and a divine judgement: Death is an hypostasized evil ("Death his death's wound shall then receive" [3.252]) and an expression of God's wrath ("life for life / I offer, on mee let thine anger fall" [3.237]). It is a telling ambiguity: the Son's last speech shuttles back and forth between a divine and a satanic attribution of evil, equivocally referring the death-penalty to the Devil and to God—or, let us now say, a devilish God. Milton's God has become rather more nefarious—to paraphrase Exodus 20.5: He is a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate him—than ever he was as Alexander Pope's "School-Divine." The Father finally praises the Son's voluntary commitment: So Heav'nly love shall outdo Hellish hate, Giving to death, and dying to redeem, So dearly to redeem what Hellish hate So easily destroy'd, and still destroys (3.298-301) But despite what he says here, one cannot be sure which side the Father represents. Heavenly love is manifest in the Son's self-sacrifice, sure enough, but it is not obviously the Father's to claim. The Son is overcoming hellish hate in the form of death, but death is pardy an expression of God's severe justice. And hellish hate still perdures in the form of hereditary sin, an ontological curse which is the deity's own lunatic contrivance. All this may lead us to conclude that the Son is saving humankind from the hellish hate of the Father as much as from that of Satan. The Father has the last word in the debate, and it is perhaps easy to let his orthodox descriptions of salvation prevail. The Father persists, for example, in his imposition of an archetypal inter pretation on the experiences of Adam and Eve; he also assumes it is natural that Adam's "crime makes guilty all his Sons" (3.290); and, of course, the deity supposes throughout that death is a just punishment for the sins of all people everywhere, whatever individual circumstances and intentions attend them. The Father, as I have tried to show, has by this point lost credibility, and so his doctrinaire pronouncements sounds rather more like deceit or self-delusion than expressions of genuinely commensurate justice. As Drummond shrewdly puts it, "nothing that has happened anywhere in the action necessitates the fall of the progeny Milton fails to understand that this dogma, an article of faith in theology, when it is cast into narrative ceases to be an article of faith and remains only an inexplicable dogma in the midst of explicable motives and therefore gathers around itself the most horrifying doubts" (III.57); we can only explain the damning of the sons and daughters with reference to a demonic mind.15 At best, Milton's God remains a poor reader of the narrative he inhabits, for no narrative evidence exists that would require a sensible reader to approve of the doctrine of hereditary sin; at worst, the deity is demonic for insisting on the guilt of the progeny, since the Son has proposed excellent reasons to conclude that it is "only right" that "Man should find grace." Two hundred years earlier, in an English poem of a very different kind of eminence, William Langland's laymen were made to protest, "Why sholde we that now ben, for the werkes of Adam / Roten and torende? Reson wolde it nevere! / Unusquisque onus suumportabit [For everyone shall bear his own burden, Galatians 6.5]" (10.114— 15). They had reason and revelation on their side in their cavil with the clerical abstruseness they encountered. Milton might have answered the lay dissenters in the manner of Langland's Ymagi natif, who brusquely dismisses the question out of hand—"For alle that wilneth to wite the whyes of God almyghty, / I wolde his eighe were in his ers and his fynger after" (10.124— 25)!—instructing the laity never to question the ways of God, but to "bileve lelly in the loore of Holy Chirche" (10.121). One could be led to suppose that the dictate "just believe" represents a typically medi eval response of a pre-Reformation era, with its conformist forces at work in the ecclesiastical institution generating a consensus of belief. Lang land's own shrewd questioning should be suffici ent evidence to debunk that period stereotype, and it would be far better to think of the injunction derived from authority as one which in any era coexits alongside—or rather, a priori against—more skeptical attitudes and refractory forces. Such is finally the case in Milton. It was typically this poet's exegetical purpose to submit</page><page sequence="11">82 MILTON QUARTERLY a rationale that could hold up to scrutiny in dependently of what authority says; Milton was one to supply evidence and then reason from it, or to attempt to make a doctrine follow inevitably from myth. Thus his work is supposed to be able to address the skeptic or the unbeliever. Yet Milton's Reformist apologetics must ultimately rely as much upon presumptive authority as har dwon inductive inference if it is to remain intact with respect to the inevitability of hereditary sin. To my mind, then, the deity's self-defense is a dramatic failure on literary grounds, and perhaps Milton half-consciously recognized as much when he composed the angels' hymn in lavish adulation of the Omnipotent, Immutable, Immortal, Infinite, Eternal King; thee Author of all being, Fountain of Light, thyself invisible Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit'st Thron'd inaccessible (3.372-77) to cap off the debate in heaven. It is as if the poet were retreating from drama to the safe-haven of dogmatic abstraction, attempting to recuperate a manageable simplicity by raising the Father back up the systematic, non-narrative metaphysical plane.16 Yet no list of superlatives is able to alleviate the problems of the preceding presenta tion of embodied deity, who is hardly "invisible" or "inaccessible" to us. On the contrary, as Hale puts it, "the God whom by definition no one has seen is here seen too clearly, humanly; in short, shrunken" (69). Only an exegesis that strips the Father of his biblical-sized anthropomorphism can hope to restore him to a purer conceptual condition, and only a critical reading that idly withdraws from the sophistication of the mimetic narrative can make it into a defense of hereditary sin, but of course such egregious malpractice would be tantamount to imitating the Father in his violation of Milton's better art. Dalhousie University Notes I wish to acknowledge my happy debt to John Baxter for introducing me to the narrative perplexities of the poem, and I hope that my article goes some way toward bringing the late C. Q. Drummond's contributions to the subject the wider recognition they deserve. 1 It is worth noting that the interpretive tradition 1 am indebted to is the one which observes Waldock's once revolutionary but rudimentary, and frequently neglected, assumption: "in reading Paradise Lost we must not always expect to find that Milton's intention is perfectly matched by his performance—that what he meant to do in any given case has always its exact counterpart in what he did" (25). 2 For instance, Irene Samuel stated that "the quick, terse, unplanned scene in Heaven arrives by tremendous leaps at a resolution unimaginable except to Omniscience at the outset" (241). Importantly, Samuel begins by acknowledging that the audience feels as though they have been led through a dialectical process; there is a sense of progression, adjustment, arrival, and resolution to the argument. Yet the critic concludes that ultimately we must be mistaken about the ap parent contingency of the dialogue: where it concerns the Father, any sense of dialectical movement must finally be discounted, for in the face of a once-and-for-all divine determination there is no possibility of an evolving divine perspective. More recendy, Dennis Danielson, arguing along similar lines, claims that the Son's powerful challenge in the midst of the debate merely provides "the opportunity for the divine plan to be revealed. It is as if God replies: 'I was hoping you would ask me that'" {Milton's Good God 108). This explanation, like Samuel's, tends to explain away the reader's sense of dynamic de velopment in the narrative in favour of an a priori formulation of static intention and fixed meaning. Danielson and Samuel both assume that, at least from the divine perspective if not also from Milton's, nothing was at stake in the debate.</page><page sequence="12">MILTON QUARTERLY 83 3 C. S. Lewis has said that "the sound course is to judge the poem on its merits, not to pre-judge it by reading doctrinal errors into the text. And as far as doctrine goes, the poem is overwhelmingly Christian" (92). I would press further, against Lewis, in urging that reading the poem on its merits means evacuating all doctrinal prejudice whatsoever. 4 For background and further exposition of the accommodative hermeneutic as it relates to Milton see C. A. Patrides, "Paradise Lost and the Theory of Accommodation;" H. R. MacCallum, "Milton and Figurative Interpretation of the Bible." 3 For biblical and theological antecedents of Milton's anthropomorphism see Gordon Cam pell, "Popular Traditions of God in the Renais sance," pp. 509—13;MichaelLieb, "ReadingGod: Milton and the Anthropopathetic Tradition; and for a survey of criticism and further contextuali zation see Hilda M. Bonham, "The Anthropo morphic God of Paradise Lost." C. S. Lewis famously expressed discontent with Miltomc anthropomorphism (130-31). In a fine recent article, "Voicing Milton's God," John K. Hale postulates various reasons including in particular epic and biblical anthropomorphism as consti tuting the limitations of Milton's God the Father. For an interesting contrast to Milton's usual embrace of biblical literalism see Christian Doctrine VI.ii, where he discusses the verse "Jehovah repented that he had created man, Gen. vi. 6" (CD 134). Here the theologian's rigorous rationalism comes into conflict with scriptural revelation where God's own representation of himself does not comport with the demands of logical possibility and the dogma of an immutable God. One can some times find Milton in his systematic theology overhauling biblical language to suit the require ments of a rationalist epistemology (e.g., the rale of non-contradiction and the anthmetic unity of God). Such examples doubdess point to Milton's occasional "distrust of metaphor as an instrument of religious knowledge" (MacCallum 400). 6 But one may ask whether the accommodative assumption can be imported into a non-scriptural text such as Paradise Lost. Primarily, I think accommodation gives us scope for arguing that Milton's depictions of the Father are meant to be taken literally, especially in cases where the poet's epic figures are replications of inspired biblical ones. Milton regularly invokes stock biblical tropes, such as the extended metaphors of fatherhood, kingship, and the legal proceedings. If such figures are sufficient in the Bible, then we may draw the inference that they are sufficient outside the Bible as well. Of course, the differ ence is that Milton's poem does not have the same guarantee of divine intentionality that the Bible does. As Michael Lieb argues: it is one thing to argue for an authorized representation of deity on the basis of scrip tural self-sufficiency; it is quite another to make the same claim on the basis of poetic reenactment. Milton's epic, after all, is not the Bible, nor can it be said that God authorizes his presence in Paradise host in the same manner that he does in Scriptures The question remains, then, in what manner the accommodative formulation of deity is to be understood in Milton's epic. (232) In answer to his own question, Lieb argues that we cannot read Milton's God under the rubric of accommodation. God is instead "inaccessible"; we must look to the Son for an embodiment of "all that is otherwise unknowable in God" (234). Lieb recommends that we refer our under standing of the deity (in particular, his passibility) to the Son, "Divine Similitude, / In whose conspicuous count'nance, without cloud / Made visible, th'Almighty Father shines, / Whom else no creature can behold" (3.383—86; cf. 6.680—83). As the narrator indicates, we are to behold the Father in the Son. Critics commonly acquiesce to this in-built accommodative postulate; see, for example, Marilyn Arnold, "Milton's Accessible God: The Role of the Son in Paradise hosf'; Kathleen M. Swaim, "The Mimesis of Accommodation in Book 3 of Paradise Lost," p. 466; Isabel G. MacCaffrey, "The Theme of Paradise host, Book 3," passim. To use Lieb's terms, the Son stands in as a kind of surrogate "reader": "Like those who 'read' God in Scriptures," argues Lieb, "the Son reads his Father in the text of his 'beingness'"</page><page sequence="13">84 MILTON QUARTERLY (235). Lieb concludes that "the Son is the only one who can read his Father in this manner" (235). What is notable about this account is that it places Milton's God beyond critique by positing an unknowable divine essence in the Father's place. The notorious characterological cruxes that have plagued Milton's presentation of deity are thereby conveniendy eschewed. Yet this approach contradicts Milton's own sense of the applicability of biblical figures to the divine person, and, still more significandy, would have us ignore the very direct and spectacular access to divinity that the poem in fact gives us. For we do not have to de pend on the Son for mediation of God, whatever theology demands in this regard. Milton, having embodied divinity in the character of the Father and in the medium of narrative, makes us de facto readers of God too. What is more, it is just these facts of divine immanence and providential inter vention (in the text, in human history) that the poet is attempting to justify and make intelligible. 7 Background to the dialogue can be sought in Albert C. Labriola, '"God Speaks': Milton's Dia logue in Heaven and the Tradition of Divine Deliberation"; see also Merritt Y. Hughes chap ter, "The Filiations of Milton's Celestial Dia logue," in Ten Perspectives on Milton. 8 Incongruities previously noted by another critic include the following: the Father observes that Satan has broken loose from Hell (3.80ff.), which is a half-truth, given that "high permission of all ruling Heaven / Left him [Satan] at large to his own dark designs" (1.212—13). As Drummond puts it, "here is the warden who removed the chains and is now riled because the prisoner is following the warden's plan and has escaped" (III.56). This is an important point about relative autonomy of God's creatures, an issue that I will go on to explore in a different case. 9 Marshall Grossman offers a very different assessment of human authorial autonomy in "Authors to Themselves": Milton and the Revelation of History, "Introduction," pp. 1-25, et passim. From this critic's point of view, individuals with a propedy "regenerate heart" (4) will attempt to conform their lives to the revealed, typological design of history: "To judge and chose well, it is necessary to match the story one is writing to a revelation of providence's story of all things" (8). Fair and good, except that as we shall see Milton's God's "story of all things" represents a dramatic misprision of truly epic proportions that reduces singular events and persons to "types," thus denying individuals of substantive autonomy where it touches the question of their specific sins. 10 And as Philip J. Gallagher's Milton, the Bible, and Misogyny shows, this is not just a quibble over the exclusivity of sexist language: Eve's "sinless deception," the critic thinks, makes her sin less serious than Adam's, and this entails a radical revisionary critique of 1 Timothy 2.1115. Milton was grappling with serious issues with respect to gender politics that the Father's elision sorely passes over. 11 Waldock, in chapter three of Paradise Lost and its Critics, makes the famous and persuasive case that Adam fell through love and was not, as the narrator dubiously construes it, "fondly overcome with Female charm" (9.999). See Drummond, "An Anti-Miltonist Reprise, IV: Adam and Eve: or, God Hates Love," passim. 12 See Hale's comments on the tone and idiom, the "staple starkness" (64), of the Father's voice. 13 For Empson's assessment see Milton's God, pp. 207-8, 243—45. He conjectures jocularly that "what Milton is thinking has to be: 'God couldn't have been satisfied by torturing himself to death, not if I know God; you could never have bought him off with that money; he could only have been satisfied by torturing somebody else to death.' Until I tried to follow the mind of Milton, I did not realize why the doctrine of the Trinity had been considered so important" (208). For a view of the near logical necessity for the incom mensurability of Father and Son in Milton's atonement, see Kolbrener's discussion of Arian ism in Milton's Warring Angels, p. 150—51. 14 Milton's unrelenting and prolix dissent from orthodox theology of the Godhead is found in the Christian Doctrine, Book 1, Chapter V: e.g. "The God to whom we were reconciled, whoever</page><page sequence="14">MILTON QUARTERLY 85 he is, cannot, if he is one God, be the same as the God by whom we were reconciled .... [T|he Father alone is a self-existent God" (218). Mi lton's position has variously been described as "Arian," "antitrinitarian," and "subordinationist"; on the critical vocabulary see John P. Rumrich, pp. 79—81, who argues against Patrides and others for the pertinence of Arianism in Paradise host. 11 As indeed, coincidental^, the very same idea—i.e., the anticipation of corporate hereditary sin—originated in the mind of the "author of all ill" (see Drummond, 111.55). 16 According to John Carey, a very similar "retreat" from drama to dogma—this time by way of allegorical abstraction—characterizes Milton's treatment of the origination of sin as such in Book 2. Milton has Sin spring personified out of Satan's head instead of having sin's formation witnessed and plausibly explained "in the poem's usual narrative mode" (143). Works Cited Arnold, Marilyn.
