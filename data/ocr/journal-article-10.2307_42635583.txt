González Morales Published online: 24 January 2013 © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013 Abstract In this article we review the history of the terms and ideas that have been used to conceptualize Paleolithic art since the end of the 19th century. Between 1900 and 1970, prehistoric representations were typically divided into two main groups: parietal art (including rock and cave art) and portable (or mobiliáry) art. This classification gave rise to asymmetrical attitudes about Paleolithic images. In particular, many portable and nonfigurative representations were overlooked while a small number of cave paintings were praised for their realism. Although the por- table/parietal division has remained a popular divide among archaeologists, in the last 30 years increasing numbers of specialists have crossed the boundaries estab- lished by these categories. They have developed new frameworks within which more kinds of images are meaningfully approached and incorporated into the analysis of Paleolithic art and symbolism. The emergence of new approaches to Pleistocene imagery is the result of a number of interrelated processes, including the globalization of Paleolithic art studies, the impact of new discoveries, and the development of new approaches to art, images, and symbolism.

Paleolithic art, the art of the last Ice Age, is usually divided into four groups: (a) portable or MOBILIÁRY ART [...] (b) deep engravings or bas-reliefs on large blocks of stone in rockshelters [...] (c) art on rock in the open air [...] (d) cave-art or PARIETAL ART (Bahn 2001, p. 344). These two ways of arranging Paleolithic representations certainly foster different reactions among readers. The opening list, inspired by a famous short story by Borges (1996, pp. 85-86), will likely be considered a bizarre way of grouping prehistoric images. Paleolithic representations here are classified in a random fashion and grouped into a strange set of categories. The classification is unreasonable and illogical in reference to current standards. The absurdity of the Borges-inspired system contrasts with the feeling of familiarity associated with the second typology, proposed by Bahn (2001) in the Penguin Archaeological Guide. Most readers will find Bahn's approach a more useful way of ordering Paleolithic artwork. After all, archaeologists, anthropologists, and art historians have used categories such as mobiliáry art, engravings, rock art, and cave art for more than a century. This example illustrates how scholars operate within traditions that define appropriate and inappropriate ways of thinking and, of course, acceptable and unacceptable classifications. In this article we examine the history of the terms and ideas used to conceptualize Paleolithic images. We begin with a detailed study of the language employed by archaeologists to describe Paleolithic representations. Textual analysis reveals that since the beginning of the 20th century, Paleolithic images have been primarily divided into two main groups: parietal art (including rock and cave art) and portable (or mobiliáry) art. The prevalence of this classification relates to a number of factors. First, the parietal/portable dichotomy is a technological classification based on an objective division of Paleolithic artwork; one form of art is movable and the other is not. Second, these categories are firmly rooted within the modern system of art, i.e., the system of ideas, practices, and institutions that have determined Western understandings of art throughout the last two centuries. This system has influenced the interpretation of Paleolithic images in many ways. In particular, we argue that the parietal/portable division is reminiscent of the modern distinction between arts and crafts. A survey of the terminology sets the stage for further exploration of the complex and multiple ways in which Paleolithic representations have been conceptualized during the last century. We examine the period during which the parietal/portable division became the prevalent way of classifying Paleolithic representations (c. 1900-1970). At that time, French specialists Henri Breuil and André Leroi-Gourhan dominated the field of Paleolithic art studies and publications focused on the Franco-Cantabrian region. Furthermore, the interpretation of Pleistocene images Ô Springer</page><page sequence="3">J Archaeol Res (2013) 21:269-306 271 was subject to the authority of art history. For instance, Paleolithic art specialists borrowed some of their working concepts (such as style, perspective, and realism) from art historians. Similarly, the "naturalistic" ideal, prevalent in art theory since the Renaissance, guided the interpretation of prehistoric images. In this setting, the most realistic cave paintings and statuettes were generally praised for their accuracy and truthfulness and nonfigurative artwork was largely ignored. The main effect of the repeated use of the parietal/portable distinction at that time was that most specialists focused on cave paintings and underestimated the importance of thousands of portable artifacts and personal ornaments. While terms such as cave art, rock art, and mobiliáry art have passed into the common parlance of Pleistocene art specialists, modern research has ceased to be driven or conditioned by a broad acceptance of the portable/parietal dichotomy. As we discuss below, in the last 30 years (c. 1980-2010) innovative approaches that integrate new kinds of images into analyses of Paleolithic imagery have emerged. This process is the result of new discoveries (such as Grotte Cosquer, Fig. 1), new methodologies, and certain changes in a number of disciplines concerned with prehistoric images, including archaeology, anthropology, art history, and visual studies. In the last three decades an increasing number of Paleolithic representations have been reported in Africa, America, Asia, and Australia. These discoveries have made clear that European cave paintings are among hundreds of depictions that constitute Paleolithic visual cultures, including cupules, geometric marks, dots, and finger markings. In addition, since the 1970s archaeologists have shifted their focus from the study of Paleolithic art (mainly cave paintings) to the analysis of all kind of Pleistocene images. This shift parallels similar developments in the conceptu- alization of art and images in anthropology, art history, and visual studies. The broadening of the concept of Paleolithic art has thus entailed a rapid diversification of approaches to Pleistocene imagery and symbolism. In this setting, different kinds of specialists have approached Pleistocene visual cultures from diverse viewpoints and perspectives, including hunter-gatherer material culture, the origins of modern human behavior, and the relationships between art and technology. In short, the parietal/portable distinction has ceased to play an encompassing role in modern Pleistocene art research. We conclude by raising the question of whether the above- mentioned developments reflect a paradigm shift in the conceptualization of Pleistocene images. The conceptualization of Paleolithic art To determine the origins and meanings of the main categories used by Western scholars to classify Paleolithic images, we examine a select corpus of English and French publications that have appeared since the 1960s. Our analysis consists of three levels. First, we analyze archaeology and prehistory textbooks. Rarely written by specialists on Pleistocene art, these books are marketed as comprehensive reviews for archaeology students. Second, we focus on dictionaries and encyclo- pedias in which archaeologists provide comprehensive coverage of the main concepts used in archaeological research. These reference works are generally â Springer</page><page sequence="4">272 J Archaeol Res (201 3) 2 1 :269-306 Fig. 1 Grotte Cosquer (photograph by and reproduced with Jean Clones' permission) written for teachers, students, professional archaeologists, and archaeology enthu- siasts. Third, we examine books and papers written by Paleolithic art specialists that are addressed to a more specialized audience. Here we focus on works in which the conceptualization of Paleolithic art is explicitly addressed. The picture that emerges from this textual corpus is homogeneous. Analysis of these publications demonstrates that Paleolithic representations are first and foremost divided into parietal and portable categories. The former includes engravings, bas-relief sculptures, paintings, drawings, stencils, and prints found on the walls of caves (cave art) and on open-air stone surfaces (rock art). The latter refers to a heterogeneous range of portable items, including statuettes and ivory carvings, engraved bones and stones, personal ornaments, and slightly modified natural objects. Archaeology textbooks typically divide Paleolithic artwork into cave art and portable art (Crabtree and Campana 2006, p. 149; Renfrew and Bahn 2000, pp. 392-394), rock art and mobiliáry art (McDonald 2006, p. 59), mural art and portable art (Price and Feinman 2010, p. 131), cave paintings and carvings and engravings (Feder and Park 2007, pp. 369-376), or art mobilier , art pariétal , and art rupestre (Otte 1999, p. 216). Dictionaries and encyclopedias that appeared before 1990 often distinguished between cave/parietal art and mobiliáry art (Bray and Trump 1970, p. 51; Brézillon 1969, p. 35; Leroi-Gourhan 1988, p. 70; Whitehouse 1983, pp. 92, 331, 332). The dictionaries published since the mid-1990s, however, differentiate between cave art, rock art, and portable art (Bednarik 2003, pp. 6, 12, 16; Darvill 2002, pp. 266, 636; Fagan 1996, pp. 593-595; Vialou 2004, pp. 242-246). Other dictionaries include deep engravings and bas-reliefs in this classification (Bahn 1992a, p. 378, 2001, pp. 297, 344, 348; Kipfer 2000, pp. 418, 483). The parietal/portable distinction also is the primary way in which specialists order Paleolithic representations. Most French scholars endorse a distinction between Vart pariétal et rupestre (sometimes called Vart des parois) and Vart mobilier (Brézillon 1984, p. 30; Delporte 1979, p. 12, 1990, p. 32; ô Springer</page><page sequence="5">J Archaeol Res (2013) 21:269-306 273 Laming-Emperaire 1962, pp. 21-22; Leroi-Gourhan 1970, p. 206; Lorblanchet 1995, pp. 13-25, 2004, p. 13). In English-speaking countries, the notions of rock art, cave art, and portable art are clearly dominant (Bahn 1997, p. 41; Bahn and Vertut 1988, pp. 17, 18, 34; Bednarik 2001, pp. 194, 199-201; Bradley 1997, pp. 4-5; Dickson 1990, p. 96; Sieveking 1979, p. 7; White 1986, p. 7). The presence of these categories in the titles of a number of seminal works corroborates the widespread use of the parietal/portable system (e.g., Chippindale and Taçon 1998; Clottes 2008; Delluc and Delluc 1991; Lewis-Williams 1983; Sauvet and Wlodarczyk 1995; Vialou 1986; Whitley 2001). In short, rock, parietal, cave, and portable are pervasive distinctions in Paleolithic art studies. The main question is why prehistoric representations have been recurrently arranged in such a manner. To begin, the parietal/portable dichotomy refers to an objective classification based on certain features that are part of Paleolithic works of art, such as their media and portability. This classification is about the difference between human-made representations that are fixed in a cave (or in the landscape) and those that are movable. In this sense, parietal and portable images provide archaeologists with different kinds of information. As many researchers have pointed out, portable objects have the potential to move great distances and to express the social statuses of groups and individuals (Farbstein 2011; Joyce 2005; Vanhaeren 2005; Vanhaeren and D'Errico 2006; White 2003). For this reason, they are considered good indicators of social and individual identities (White 1999; Zilhão 2007), economic networks (Alvarez Fernández 2002; Kuhn and Stiner 2007), and techno- logical choices (Vanhaeren and D'Errico 2006; White 1993, 1995, 2010). On the other hand, parietal images fixed on the walls of caves (or on the surface of land) might serve as markers of the landscape (Bradley 1991, 1997, 2009; Chippindale and Nash 2004), ritual spaces (Dowson 1994; Ouzman 1998, 2001), and symbolic systems for transmitting social values and information (Barton et al. 1994; Conkey 1984). Although the portable/parietal dichotomy is a technological classification that does not explicitly judge the quality of art, these categories have been prejudiced and biased in their use. Paralleling other disciplines, Paleolithic art specialists have historically imposed additional meanings, values, and connotations onto their technical terms. The very meaning of these concepts has significantly changed in the last century. For instance, while personal ornaments were typically ignored during the first half of the 20th century, these items are now considered valuable for accessing the social universe of Paleolithic groups. We argue that art history and art theory became the main sources of influence in the conceptualization of Pleistocene art during the first half of the 20th century. Thus, some of the preconceptions and views associated with the terms used to describe Paleolithic images are embedded in contemporary understandings of art. For this reason, we briefly summarize the main traits defining the modern system of art (Kristeller 1951, p. 496; Shiner 2001, p. 14). As several authors have pointed out, from classical Greece to the end of the 17th century, what we call "the arts" were classified together with crafts and analyzed in terms of the "construction paradigm" (Abrams 1985a, p. 10, 1985b, p. 19; Kristeller 1951, p. 498; Shiner 2001, p. 19). According to this perspective, a work of art was primarily an imitation based on rules, something made according to a techne or ars (Abrams 1985b, p. 17; Kristeller 1951, p. 498; Shiner 2001, p. 19; Tatarkiewicz â Springer</page><page sequence="6">274 J Archaeol Res (20 1 3) 2 1 :269-306 1963, p. 231, 1970, p. 49). This model assumed the maker's stance toward a work of art (Abrams 1985a, p. 10). It took for granted that the making of art was the essential artistic experience. Over the course of the 18th century, however, this traditional concept of art split into new categories of "the fine arts" - poetry, painting, sculpture, architecture, and music - and "crafts or popular arts," including jewelry, pottery, and embroidery (Abrams 1985a, p. 13; Kristeller 1951, p. 498; Shiner 2001, p. 5; Summers 2003, p. 31). This division entailed important changes in the definitions of art and artist. First, the construction model was replaced by the contemplation model, according to which the genuine artistic experience was "one in which a perceiver confronts a completed work of art, [defining] the way he perceives that work as 'contemplation,' that is 'disinterested' or 'detached' " (Abrams 1985b, pp. 19-20). Second, artists and artisans became opposed. Whereas the artist was considered a genius who was able to create an object of refined pleasure by means of his/her imagination, the artisan was said to be a skilled craftsperson who applied mechanical rules to the making of standardized products (Shiner 2001, p. 115; Summers 2003, p. 31). This shift from the traditional idea of ars to the modern system of arts began during the Renaissance and culminated in the 18th century in response to new social circumstances. The 18th century saw the emergence of a new mode of life in several European countries: connoisseurship (Abrams 1985a, p. 14; Whitehead 2005, pp. 3-37). The term "connoisseur" was coined to refer to gentlemen who were especially competent in critiquing art pieces, particularly those in the fine arts (Read 1942; Simpson 1951; Summers 2003, p. 550). Interest for objects of fine taste similarly grew steadily among the European upper-middle classes. This bourgeon- ing demand encouraged the appearance of a variety of institutions that "for the first time gathered together [...] an entirely distinctive class of things called 'the fine arts' " (Abrams 1985a, p. 26). Some examples illustrate this institutional revolution. The emergence of a large middle class that read literature fueled the establishment of circulating libraries and the development of periodical publications (Abrams 1985a, p. 18; Shiner 2001, p. 88). Similarly, over the course of the 18th century numerous institutions began to offer public concerts (Shiner 2001, p. 92). This period also witnessed the opening of nearly all the most important Western public art museums. The British Museum opened in 1753, the Louvre palace was converted into Le Muséum Central des Arts in 1793, the Spanish Royal Museum of Painting and Sculpture (Museo del Prado) opened to the public in 1819, the National Gallery of London was created in 1824, and the Alte Pinakothek was inaugurated in München in 1836. In short, in the span of 100 years (1750-1850) the foundations of the modern system of art were firmly established in Europe. The side effect of this new way of understanding art was the "denigration of craft [...] by both industrial capitalism and the Academy" (Bermingham 1992, p. 162). With the rise of aesthetics, crafts were stigmatized as mere technical activities. Craftworks were characterized as the products of a mechanical and repetitive reproduction of models (Smith 2006, p. 91) and, in this sense, were opposed to the fine arts (seen as the result of spontaneous creativity). Crafts also were assumed to depend on rules and imitation; the artisan was considered a skilled craftsperson relying on practical knowledge rather than on innovation and inspiration. Springer</page><page sequence="7">J Archaeol Res (201 3) 2 1 :269-306 275 The institutional changes associated with the appearance of "fine art" took place along with a fundamental shift in Western representationalism. Since the 15th century, art and especially paintings were highly influenced by naturalism, a doctrine establishing that the artist's main aim was "the imitation of visual experience and, as far as painting was concerned, the representation on a two- dimensional surface of a three-dimensional world" (Penrose 1973, pp. 247-248). The Renaissance witnessed the emergence of a new mode of representation in which the elements of art were "presumed to coincide with the elements of optical experience" (Summers 1987, p. 3). The system of naturalism (Summers 1987, p. 6) became prevalent together with the invention of a number of technical innovations, including modeling (the systematic gradation of surfaces from light to dark to create virtual forms), foreshortening (distorting or reducing parts of figures in order to obtain three-dimensional effects), and optical perspective. The naturalistic ideal remained prevalent in art theory from the Renaissance until the end of the 19th century. For this reason, the history of art during this long period was described as "the forging of master keys for opening the mysterious locks of our senses to which only nature herself originally held the key" (Gombrich 1960, p. 289). It was only at the beginning of the 20th century that a number of artists reacted against the importance given to the imitation of nature in Western art. As we seek to demonstrate in the next section, the influence of the modern system of art on Paleolithic art studies was particularly important in the formative years of the discipline. In the first place, the parietal/portable dichotomy that became popular among archaeologists at the beginning of the 20th century was reminiscent of the fine arts/crafts distinction. This parallel does not mean that Pleistocene art specialists established a direct link between parietal art and the fine arts and between portable art and crafts, but important analogies between these categories were established. For instance, Paleolithic art scholars inherited the modern fascination for the fine arts and, in particular, paintings. Similarly, if art theorists and historians denigrated crafts, archaeologists paid little attention to certain portable pieces (such as personal ornaments). In the second place, the naturalistic ideal prevalent in art theory until the 20th century also determined archaeologists' evaluations of Paleolithic artwork. This explains why the paintings of Altamira and Niaux (Fig. 2) were initially celebrated for their realism, whereas thousand of nonfigurative representations were ignored in most Paleolithic art accounts. Paleolithic art divided: The parietal/portable dichotomy Here we describe the great division in conceptualizations of Paleolithic art that occurred over the course of the first half of the 20th century, when Pleistocene images were categorized into parietal and portable. We identify the roots of this division in the recognition of Paleolithic art at the end of the 19th century and examine the processes through which the parietal/portable dichotomy became the main way of classifying Paleolithic representations in the first years of the 20th century. We also explore the impact of this division on interpretations of Paleolithic art from 1900 to 1970. In particular, we suggest that the main consequence of the ^ Springer</page><page sequence="8">276 J Archaeol Res (20 1 3) 2 1 :269-306 Fig. 2 Niaux (photograph by and reproduced with Jean Clottes' permission) systematic use of these categories during this 70-year period was that archaeologists tended to overemphasize the importance of cave paintings to the detriment of portable objects. The recognition of Paleolithic art has been the subject of a great deal of scholarship (e.g., Bahn 1992b, 1997; Bahn and Vertut 1988; Freeman 1994; Moro Abadía 2006; Moro Abadía and González Morales 2004), so we limit ourselves here to a brief summary of how this authentication determined Western conceptualiza- tions of prehistoric images. The existence of Paleolithic art was first established in the 1860s through the discovery of engraved and carved bones associated with prehistoric tools in southwestern France (Lartet and Christy 1864). In subsequent decades, a considerable number of similar objects, including statuettes and carvings, were found in caves and rock shelters in France and Spain (e.g., Piette 1873, 1894, 1902, 1904). In L'art pendant l'âge du Renne , the first catalog of Paleolithic portable artwork, Piette (1907) reproduced 100 plates containing hundreds of statuettes, engraved bones, and decorated objects. While portable art was authenticated in a relatively short period of time, the archaeological establishment initially neglected the discovery of the caves of Altamira (Sanz de Sautuola 1880) and Chabot (Chiron 1889). It was only after the discovery of La Mouthe, les Combarelles, and Font-de-Gaume at the turn of the 20th century that the authenticity of parietal art was established (Capitan 1902a; Cartailhac 1902). Two central lessons can be drawn from this process of recognition of Paleolithic art. First, the delay in the authentication of cave paintings reveals the different statuses that paintings and carvings had in the minds of late 19th-century archaeologists. As Conkey (1997, p. 175) notes, "the portable art, the crafts of 40 Springer</page><page sequence="9">J Archaeol Res (20 13) 21 :269-306 277 carving were more readily accepted, whereas the sometimes polychrome and 'naturalistic' paintings in cave 'galleries' were unlikely products of distant beings who had barely been admitted into the human family." In other words, cave paintings were considered too advanced to have been created by primitive people. For this reason, the prehistoric antiquity of Altamira was not accepted until the beginning of the 20th century. Second, the naturalistic ideal that had oriented art history since the Renaissance conditioned the interpretation of Paleolithic portable objects at the end of the 19th century. At that time, most archaeologists conceptualized portable art according to a double standard. On the one hand, they tended to celebrate elegant or finely crafted pieces, such as those from Brassempouy (e.g., Piette 1894, 1907). On the other hand, thousands of less realistic items were characterized as mere decorative pieces. This double standard remained prevalent during most of the 20th century. Furthermore, with the notable exception of Piette, the most important 19th-century prehistorians tended to conceptualize Paleolithic portable art as minor art. Paleolithic representational objects were often regarded as luxury pastimes (Cartailhac 1889, p. 78; Mortillet 1897, p. 241; Reinach 1889- 1894, p. 170), ornamental or decorative pieces (Evans 1878, p. 448; Wilson 1898, pp. 351-352), and naïve and infantile artwork (Dreyfus 1888, p. 224; Mortillet 1883, p. 416). Not surprisingly, Paleolithic artists were depicted as lacking reflection and foresight (Cartailhac 1889, p. 68; Mortillet 1883, p. 420), as artists incapable of creating complex compositions (Mortillet 1883, p. 416, 1897, p. 242), and as artisans particularly attached to ornaments (Dupont 1872, p. 155). The beginning of the 20th century witnessed a period of intense research that led to the discovery of numerous sites with prehistoric art, including Le Mas d'Azil in 1901, Bernifal and La Ferraise in 1902, El Castillo, Covalanas, Hornos de la Peña, and Teyjat in 1903, El Pendo in 1905, Niaux in 1906, Le Cap-Blanc in 1910, La Pasiega in 1911, Le Tue d'Audoubert and Les Trois-Frères in 1912, and Santimamiñe in 1916. Classic taxonomies of Pleistocene art were established during the first 15 years of the 20th century. Following a long-standing tradition, prehistoric art was often divided into engravings, sculptures, and paintings (e.g., Capitan 1902b, p. 1; Luquet 1926, p. 12; Reinach 1913, p. 7; Wilson 1898, p. 372). Each category was further subdivided into several groups. For instance, engraved representations were classified into engraved bones (Capitan et al. 1906, p. 429), engraved stones (Capitan et al. 1906, p. 435), and cave engravings (Capitan and Breuil 1902, p. 527; Capitan et al. 1902, p. 202, 1903, p. 364). Another popular classification among Paleolithic art specialists distinguished figurative and nonfig- urative art. The former referred to artwork in which recognizable figures were portrayed; the latter included artistic forms that did not retain a clear reference to the real world (Breuil 1906, p. 1; Luquet 1926, p. 12). In this context, early 20th-century archaeologists retained the commitment to resemblance and verisimilitude prevalent in art theory at that time. Paleolithic works of art were judged according to standards of representational accuracy, assuming that this skill had necessarily progressed from rude beginnings to three-dimensional representations. In this setting, the paintings of Altamira, Niaux, and Lascaux were considered genuine masterpieces (e.g., Breuil 1905, p. 120, 1941, p. 375; Cartailhac 1906, p. 535), and they were Ö Springer</page><page sequence="10">278 J Archaeol Res (20 13) 21 :269-306 compared to Renaissance frescoes (Breuil 1941, p. 375) and the Sistine chapel (Déchelette 1908, p. 150). The parietal/portable dichotomy was the third classification put forward by early 20th-century archaeologists (Breuil 1907, 1909, pp. 33-34; Capitan et al. 1913, p. 1; Cartailhac and Breuil 1906, pp. 123-143). Paradoxically, this was the last taxonomy to be coined and the most successful in the long term. The emergence of this division did not imply, however, that the above-mentioned typologies were completely substituted by the terms "parietal" and "portable." In fact, these taxonomies constituted complementary systems of classifying prehistoric represen- tations. For example, Capitan (1931, p. 96) pointed out that "there are three kinds of primitive graphic arts: sculptures, engravings and paintings and they are found either in portable objects (bones, deer wood, ivory, stone) or fixed ( immobiliers ) objects." Similarly, Goury (1927, pp. 264-268) distinguished three main kinds of artistic manifestations: sculptures, engravings in mobiliáry objects, and parietal engravings and paintings. In other words, Paleolithic figures were often described according to several criteria. That being said, the terms parietal and portable became increasingly popular over the course of the first half of the 20th century. Examination of the most popular French manuals of archaeology and prehistory at that time illustrates this point. In his Manuel d'archéologie préhistorique celtique et gallo-romaine , Déchelette (1908, p. 239) distinguished between parietal engravings and paintings and between ornaments, sculptures, and engravings. De Morgan (1909, p. 132) proposed a similar classificatory scheme in Les premières civilizations. Some years later, Peyrony (1914, pp. 52, 86) classified Upper Paleolithic artwork into portable art and parietal art. Boule (1923, p. 259), in Les hommes fossils , and Capitan (1931, p. 96), in La préhistoire , used the same distinction. By the 1950s and 1960s these concepts had become very popular among Paleolithic art specialists (e.g., Breuil 1952a; Breuil and Lantier 1959; Laming- Emperaire 1962; Leroi-Gourhan 1970, p. 206; Raphaël 1945; Ucko and Rosenfeld 1967). Although some specialists called for the unity of mobiliáry and cave represen- tations (Cartailhac and Breuil 1906, pp. 137-143), the parietal/portable dichotomy established a major division in the understanding of Paleolithic images. In the case of portable art, this notion made reference to a heterogeneous corpus of transportable visual images, including statuettes, figurines, contours découpés , engraved implements, plaquettes , rondelles , perforated antler batons, and personal ornaments. Despite this diversity, during the first half of the 20th-century portable objects were judged in terms of their naturalism (or their lack of it). Breuil's work illustrates this point. In 1905, Breuil wrote a short thesis on prehistoric ornamentation to become professor (privatdozent ) at the University of Fribourg. In this paper, Breuil (1905) distinguished between two kinds of portable art. First, he praised the realism of some "animal representations engraved or sculpted in bone and ivory" (Breuil 1905, p. 105). He considered these carvings as genuine masterpieces that attested an extraordinary capacity for observation (Breuil 1905, p. 120). Second, Breuil examined a number of nonfigurative engravings in portable objects. He suggested that these ornamental designs were the result of a process of degradation (un procédé de dégénérescence) of naturalistic representations. He Springer</page><page sequence="11">J Archaeol Res (2013) 21 :269-306 279 argued that figurative representations might, through lack of skill, be reduced "to the miserable role of ornamental motifs" (Breuil 1905, p. 120). Breuil's scholarship is not the only instance of the definition of certain portable pieces in terms of ornamental and decorative arts. During the first half of the 20th century, portable works of art were often described as decorative elements (Breuil 1905), objets d'ornements (Capitan 1902b, p. 10; Capitan and Bouyssonie 1924, p. 30; Peyrony 1914, p. 55), and items primarily devoted to embellishment (Luquet 1930). Psychologist and art historian Georges-Henri Luquet, for instance, divided Paleolithic art into two categories: decorative art, including carvings and statuettes, that "reposed on the idea or the sentiment that artificial modifications of pre- existing objects render them more beautiful, more agreeable to the eye" (Luquet 1926, p. 39); and figurative art, involving the creation of a form on a surface that was not there beforehand (Luquet 1930, p. 2). Whereas Luquet considered prehistoric paintings the result of a genuine creative act, he regarded portable pieces as mere transformations of previous forms. This depiction of portable artwork contrasts with the definition of parietal art prevalent during the first three-quarters of the 20th century. At that time, most archaeologists assumed that painting and drawing required higher technical and cognitive skills than those involved in making portable pieces. Ironically, this idea can be traced back to Piette's work. While Piette (1873, p. 38) held Paleolithic figurines in high esteem, he suggested that "humans had to make a considerable effort of genius in order to create the art of drawing: to represent three-dimensional objects on a flat surface by means of lines is not something that occurred to the human spirit from its origins; the art of sculpture led to bas-relief starting in the Solutrean; and the art of bas-relief developed into that of engraving and drawing in the following period." Mortillet and Breuil supported Piette's argument. In the second edition of Musée Préhistorique (Mortillet and Mortillet 1902, planche XXVIII), Mortillet argued that "the art of sculpting preceded that of engraving. This is something absolutely natural since engraving, i.e., representing three-dimensional forms on a flat surface, is a conventional art." Breuil (1909, p. 34) also adhered to Piette's idea that sculpting had preceded engraving ( sculpture d'abord, gravure ensuite). This idea remained popular among 20th-century archaeologists. According to de Morgan (1909, p. 133), "figurative art on the wall of the caves is even more interesting than the engraving or sculpting of small objects for it involves the making of full-scale representations. These images are much more difficult to create [than portable objects]." Capitan (1913, p. 705) also suggested that "the arts of drawing are in fact extremely complex [...] they involve a number of steps: perception of the object (including the perception of its form, its dimensions and its exact proportions); understanding of the object as a whole; and encoding of this information in the memory system." Supporters of the structuralist approach also implicitly assumed the technical superiority of parietal art. In fact, scholars such as Leroi-Gourhan (1982) and Laming-Emperaire (1962) devoted important treatises to Paleolithic artistic techniques. Significantly, they limited their analyses to parietal art. The preeminent role of rock images in Paleolithic art research is best illustrated by the fact that before 1970, most theories purporting to explain prehistoric art were ^ Springer</page><page sequence="12">280 J Archaeol Res (2013) 21:269-306 founded on cave paintings. Specialists rarely took into account portable represen- tations in considering the meanings of Paleolithic visual cultures. For example, leading archaeologists and art historians, including Reinach (1912), Bégouën (1929, p. 8), and Breuil (1949, p. 79), proposed hunting-magic explanations during the first half of the 20th century; these theories suggested that Paleolithic images were part of sympathetic rituals designed to guarantee success in the hunt. Significantly, the images selected to support these hypotheses were invariably cave paintings, including arrows superimposed on animals (such as in Les Trois-Frères and Niaux), triangular signs interpreted as throwing sticks, and images combining animal and human features (such as the "sorcerers" in Le Gabillou and Les Trois-Frères). Portable objects were typically excluded from hunting-magic explanations. Only certain statuettes, such as the "Venus" from Laugerie-Basse and Willendorf, were considered instances of a cult of fertility seeking to guarantee the group's reproduction. Even the monographs that allotted more importance to portable art, such as those of Zervos (1959) and Graziosi (1960), focused on parietal art to explain the meaning of prehistoric images. By the 1960s, art-as-magic interpretations were replaced by structuralism, a theoretical framework that regarded Paleolithic images as symbols that reproduced an underlying mythogram (e.g., Laming-Emperaire 1962; Leroi-Gourhan 1965- 1995; Raphaël 1945). These authors suggested that Pleistocene representations were part of structured systems that reproduced a male-female binary structural principle. In several papers, Leroi-Gourhan (1970, p. 206, 1976, pp. 5-6) admitted that his work was based on cave paintings rather than on mobiliáry objects. He provided two main reasons. First, "unlike mobiliáry artwork[s] which have lost their connections with their material context, parietal works guarantee a complete understanding of their spatial disposition" (Leroi-Gourhan 1970, p. 206; see also Leroi-Gourhan 1976, pp. 5-6). In other words, Leroi-Gourhan stated that the contexts of parietal art are primary and those of portable art are secondary. While this is true, the irony is that mobiliáry pieces can be easily dated in those secondary contexts and parietal paintings can be dated only with difficulty. Second, he argued that the study of rock art had been dominated by a "need to explain" the meaning of prehistoric representations (un besoin d'expliquer, Leroi-Gourhan 1970, p. 206); for Leroi- Gourhan, in viewing these paintings scholars experience an "aesthetic feeling" that requires an explanation. Significantly, Leroi-Gourhan associated this aesthetic feeling only with rock art and not with portable pieces. In short, structuralism was based mainly on the analysis of cave paintings, including the definition of different areas within the cave, the position of animals on the decorated walls, and the association of certain representations. Portable objects were generally evoked to confirm the main hypotheses about the chronology, the distribution, and the meaning of parietal representations. In sum, we distinguish a number of traits that define Paleolithic art research from 1900 to 1970. First, most specialists were French, including Capitan, Reinach, Breuil, Luquet, Leroi-Gourhan, and Laming-Emperaire. Scholars from other countries played a minor role in prehistoric art studies. Second, nearly all publications on Pleistocene art heavily emphasized the Franco-Cantabrian traditions of South-Western Europe or restricted their coverage to this small geographic region â Springer</page><page sequence="13">J Archaeol Res (2013) 21 :269-306 281 (Bednarik 1996, p. 123). Paleolithic art was believed to be a European (mainly French and Spanish) phenomenon. Third, prehistoric art specialists were highly influenced by art history. Breuil (1907) and Leroi-Gourhan (1965-1995) suggested that prehistoric art had evolved from primitive to naturalistic representations. This idea had its origins in the interpretation of art history as progressing toward naturalism (Carrier 2008, p. 37; Elkins 2002, pp. 59-60). Fourth, Paleolithic art was systematically divided into parietal and portable representations. While this classification did not distinguish the significance of art, cave paintings were generally overemphasized relative to portable representational objects. A consid- erable number of Paleolithic representations (nonfigurative images, marks, personal ornaments) were disregarded in the analysis. As we show in the next section, however, vigorous signs of resistance to the parietal/portable dichotomy and, in particular, its effects on interpretations of Pleistocene visual cultures have emerged over the last 30 years. Recent developments in the conceptualization of Paleolithic art The parietal/portable dichotomy is still the most common way of classifying Paleolithic art among specialists, archaeologists, and the general public. This divide is a basic and useful typology, since movable and fixed forms of art are distinct media that reflect different aspects of Paleolithic art and symbolism. Furthermore, these technical terms have been used and accepted for so long that they are now difficult to replace (Bradley 1997, p. 5). The pervasiveness of the parietal/portable dichotomy does not mean, however, that the dichotomy is without critics. In the last 30 years several authors have explicitly called into question this "unjustifiable split within Paleolithic art" (Vialou 1998, p. 269). In particular, scholars have criticized the disdain for portable objects associated with this arrangement of Pleistocene representations (e.g., Clottes 1990, p. 5; Conkey 1997, pp. 174-175, 2010, p. 275; Nowell 2006, p. 245; White 1992, p. 541). Furthermore, recent developments in Paleolithic art studies have generated new avenues of research in which the parietal/ portable dichotomy is becoming less and less relevant. Here we consider three interrelated processes that explain, up to a point, recent developments in Paleolithic art research: the globalization of Pleistocene art studies, the broadening of the concept of Paleolithic art (best exemplified by the shift from the term "prehistoric art " to that of "Pleistocene images"), and the diversification of approaches to Paleolithic imagery and symbolism. The globalization of Pleistocene art studies Globalization has become a key concept in many social and human sciences (Ritzer 2010; Turner 2010; Waters 1995). As several authors have pointed out, this term refers to the intensification of worldwide social, economic, and cultural relation- ships (Giddens 1990, p. 64; Robertson 1992, p. 8). In the case of Paleolithic art studies, the impact of globalization has led to a number of important changes. First, in last 30 years archaeologists have effectively demonstrated that Paleolithic art is a Springer</page><page sequence="14">282 J Archaeol Res (201 3) 2 1 :269-306 worldwide phenomenon. Although today we take this for granted, it is important to keep in mind that as late as the 1960s leading specialists were persuaded that "beyond Europe, documents [were] few, very strange and insufficiently dated" (Leroi-Gourhan 1965-1995, p. 277). This belief had more to do with the Eurocentric bias that oriented prehistoric research than to a lack of evidence. The case of Namibian and South African rock paintings is a paradigmatic case of this ethnocentrism. Western scholars, including prehistoric art specialists, have known of the existence of this sophisticated rock art since the beginning of the 20th century (e.g., Cartailhac and Breuil 1906, pp. 173-199; Obermaier et al. 1930; Tongue 1909). Persuaded that the ancestors of African aboriginal peoples could have not created such advanced paintings, prestigious archaeologists and ethnologists like Dart (1925), Frobenius (1928), and Breuil (1952b) attributed these representations to travelers from Europe and Asia. The most notorious instance of this interpretation is the so-called "white lady of Brandberg." Discovered by Reinhart Maack in 1917, Breuil (1952b, p. 236) described this painting as "that of a young woman with a typically Mediterranean, perhaps Cretan profile" and that "her flesh is white and her hair dark reddish-brown [...] there can be no doubt about the Mediterranean character of the profile." Some years later, a less biased interpretation has led archaeologists to identify the white lady of Brandberg as a San painting depicting a man, probably a shaman, performing a ritual dance (Lewis-Williams 2000, pp. 69-71). The Eurocentrism of Paleolithic art interpretations remained largely unchal- lenged until the 1970s. At that time, a number of political and cultural changes - the rise of postcolonial studies, the increasing resistance to racial segregation, and the entering of aboriginal groups into the political arena - promoted less Eurocentric views of non-European art. Furthermore, the worldwide expansion of systems of higher education after 1970 (Benavot 1992; Meyer et al. 1992) entailed the creation of departments of archaeology, anthropology, and art history in virtually all countries. As a result of these developments, an impressive number of sites with Paleolithic art have been discovered in Africa (Coulson and Campbell 2001 ; Deacon 2007; Le Quellec 2004; Lewis-Williams 2000, 2006), America (Loendorf et al. 2005; Whitley 2001), Australia (Bednarik 2010; Taçon 2010, 2011; Taçon et al. 2012), and Asia (Bednarik 1994; Olivieri 2010; Taçon et al. 2010). New institutions devoted to the documentation and preservation of sites with prehistoric art around the world have been created, including AURA (Australian Rock Art Research Association), IFRAO (International Federation of Rock Art Organisations), ARARA (American Rock Art Research Association), and the Bradshaw Founda- tion, a nonprofit organization based in Geneva. As a result of this globalization of knowledge production, the profile of prehistoric art specialists has significantly changed in the last decades. If until the 1960s most Paleolithic art specialists were French scholars mainly interested in European cave art, since the 1970s the study of Pleistocene art has attracted an increasing number of scholars from around the world. Moreover, since at least the 1960s, studies of Paleolithic art in most parts of the world have followed trends in anthropology, not art history. This anthropolog- ical turn explains recent developments in the conceptualization of Paleolithic images. Springer</page><page sequence="15">J Archaeol Res (2013) 21 :269-306 283 Recent developments in the conceptualization of Paleolithic images In recent years, important changes in the terminology used to classify Paleolithic art have taken place. We distinguish two main processes that explain recent developments in the conceptualization of Pleistocene images. First, former concepts such as parietal and portable have taken on new meanings. Second, recent decades have witnessed the broadening of the concept of Paleolithic art beyond the parietal/ portable dichotomy. In this setting, prehistoric art specialists have incorporated new kinds of images, including abstract and nonfigurative depictions, into the analysis of prehistoric visual cultures. The revalorization of portable art As described above, the parietal/portable dichotomy engendered pejorative attitudes toward Paleolithic mobiliáry art. From 1900 to 1970, most specialists supported the idea that the manufacturing of portable items demanded less cognitive and technical skills than those required to paint or draw an animal on a rock surface. Second, scholars also tended to assume that certain portable items, such as ornaments or engraved pieces, were bagatelles or trifles of little value. Since the 1970s, however, this twofold prejudice concerning the manufacturing and the meaning of portable objects has been reexamined. Several archaeologists have demonstrated that the artistic skills involved in making Paleolithic figurines may be as complex as those required for cave paintings (e.g., Bosinski 1982; Clottes 1996; Conard 2003; Hahn 1986; Marshack 1985; Reinhardt et al. 1994; White 1992, 2006). The publication of Marshack's The Roots of Civilization in 1972 reawakened an interest in portable statuary. The sophisticated photographic techniques he used enabled specialists to see portable pieces with new eyes (Marshack 1972a). Some years later, the systematic application of optical and scanning electron microscopy led archaeol- ogists to fully appreciate the complexity of certain portable pieces (e.g., D'Errico and Villa 1997; White 2006, 2007). Use of this technology has documented an impressive number of manufacturing procedures used in making prehistoric statuettes, including grooving, hammering, incising, pecking, scraping, polishing, and hacking (White 2006). Archaeologists also have questioned the minor role of mobiliáry materials in interpretative theories. Whereas the potential social meanings of many forms of portable art (including decorated objects, engraved tools, and portable ornaments) were overlooked during the first half of the 20th century, since the 1970s numerous studies have demonstrated that portable pieces may possess highly symbolic value. These new characterizations of mobiliáry art have been influenced by the innovative approaches to the body that appeared after World War II. Although anthropological reflections on this topic can be traced back to Hertz (1928) and Mauss (1934), an "anthropology of the body" stricto sensu appeared in the 1970s. At that time, Douglas (1970), Blacking (1977), and others (e.g., Benthall and Polhemus 1975; Boltanski 1971; Polhemus 1978; Turner 1984) depicted human bodies as media of social and cultural expression. In this context, anthropologists became interested in the role played by bodily decorations in the transmission of social roles, statuses, Springer</page><page sequence="16">284 J Archaeol Res (2013) 21:269-306 and memberships. They suggested that tattoos, hairstyles, engraved items, and personal ornaments were powerful means of expressing individual and collective identities (e.g., Schneider 1966; Turner 1980). Anthropological literature inspired an "archaeology of the body" that since the 1990s has conceptualized the body both as a surface of inscription that reflects the identity of past people (e.g., Fisher and Loren 2003; Hamilakis et al. 2002; Joyce 2005, 2008; White 1992, 2007) and as a site of embodied agency that articulates the relationships between the individual and his/her society (e.g., Boric and Robb 2008; Csordas 1994). In this framework, archaeologists have increasingly recognized the social and cultural significance of portable materials (e.g., Conard 2003; D'Errico et al. 2003; Farbstein 2006; Farbstein and Svoboda 2007; Nowell 2006; Taborin 2004; Vanhaeren and D'Errico 2006; White 1992, 1997, 2006, 2007). Broadening the concept of Paleolithic art If during the first half of the 20th century analysis of prehistoric art was restricted largely to cave paintings and the most spectacular carvings, during the last 40 years Paleolithic art studies have expanded to incorporate a wide variety of representa- tions, including marks, abstract images (parietal or portable), and prehistoric ornaments. In this setting, authorized voices have proposed to replace traditional views, centered mainly on Paleolithic art , by new approaches interested in all kind of images. The current revalorization of nonfigurative representations illustrates the expansion of Paleolithic art research beyond traditional categories. There are a number of factors that explain the incorporation of nonrepresenta- tional images into the analysis of prehistoric imagery since the 1970s. First, generally speaking, archaeological interests in nonfigurative representations have been fueled by the rise of abstract expressionism, where abstract images were understood to be as meaningfully constituted as representational art. This view had its origins in the early years of the 20th century, when a group of artists reacted against the predominant role of figurative forms in the history of Western art (Elkins 2002, p. 59, 2005, p. 62; Penrose 1973). Painters like Cézanne, Picasso, and Mondrian (or, more broadly, post-impressionists, cubists, and neoplasticists) explored new forms of art in which references to the real world were eliminated. These developments, however, were not fully incorporated into art history until the 1970s. At that time, the proliferation of visual studies helped ground understanding for many different kinds of images, including nonfigurative representations, geometric configurations, and "images that are not art" (Bal 2003; Elkins 1995; Mitchell 1986). Second, anthropological studies, especially where they were strongly aligned with archaeology (like in the US), gave rise to a greater understanding of non-Western art that included nonfigurative imagery that was highly symbolic. For instance, Boas' Primitive art (1927) examined a considerable number of nonrepresentative images in the context of small-scale societies, including symmetrical designs, geometrical forms, conceptual images, and many other formal elements. In the 1970s and 1980s, semiotics influenced relevant developments in material cultural studies, including the studies of Faris (1972) on Nuba, Seeger (1981) on the Suya, and O'Hanlon (1989) on the Wahgi. In sum, by â Springer</page><page sequence="17">J Archaeol Res (201 3) 2 1 ¡269-306 285 the 1980s numerous sociological and anthropological studies had demonstrated the highly symbolic value of nonfigurative representations in hunter-gatherer societies. The revalorization of nonfigurative art in the West set the ground for new approaches to nonrepresentational images in Paleolithic art research. Current interests in geometric and abstract imagery can be traced back to the 1960s when structuralist authors interpreted nonfigurative images as signs that played an important role in Paleolithic symbolic systems. Leroi-Gourhan (a pupil of Marcel Mauss who completed his doctorate on the archaeology of the North Pacific) attributed masculine/feminine values to Paleolithic representations on the basis of their association with certain nonfigurative signs. Furthermore, Leroi-Gourhan (1993, p. 190) suggested that "abstraction was the source of graphic expression." He argued that "graphism [graphisme] certainly did not start by reproducing reality in a slavishly photographic manner. On the contrary, we see it develop over the space of some ten thousand years from signs which, it would appear, initially expressed rhythms rather than forms" (Leroi-Gourhan 1993, p. 190). Under the influence of structuralism, semiotics, and anthropological studies, new perspectives on Paleolithic imagery emerged in the 1970s and the 1980s in the Anglo-American world (e.g., Conkey 1978, 1984, 1985; Marshack 1972a, b, 1976, 1979; Marshack and Mundkur 1979; Wobst 1977). According to some of these authors, Paleolithic images were not a homogeneous unitary phenomenon but "systems of visual representation in permanent archaeologically visible media" (Conkey 1984, p. 262). These systems varied over time and across space, reflecting differences in their contexts of production. The formal variability of media, techniques, and symbolic repertories in Paleolithic art was interpreted as different ways of transmitting valuable information within or among hunter-gatherer groups. Debates about style and function illustrate this interpretation. The concept of style was used extensively in Paleolithic art research until the 1970s to refer to the different periods that define the formal development of Paleolithic art. For instance, Leroi-Gourhan (1965-1995, p. 51) suggested that cave paintings have evolved through five styles that correspond to five chronological periods. Since the 1 970s, however, a number of authors have used this term in a different way (e.g., Brantingham 2007; Conkey 1978; O'Brien and Lyman 2003; Sackett 1977, 1982). Wobst (1977, p. 335) interpreted stylistic behavior as "that aspect of artifact form and structure which can be related to processes of information exchange." Style was no longer understood as each one of the periods defining the formal evolution of Paleolithic art but as a conventional way of exchanging information within hunter-gatherer groups (Barton et al. 1994, Pfeiffer 1982; Wiessner 1983). The definition of Paleolithic images as conventional systems opened the door to new understandings of Pleistocene art. After all, if prehistoric images were nothing more than conventional visual schemes for exchanging information, then there was no reason to consider any particular mode of representation (figurative art) as being superior to any other. As a result of these developments, since the 1980s archaeologists have increasingly accepted that nonfigurative signs might have been of equal importance as figurative cave paintings to hunter-gatherer groups. The engraved ochre pieces discovered at Biombos cave (South Africa) in the 1990s are the best example of how nonfigurative images have become theoretically important (Fig. 3). Two of these â Springer</page><page sequence="18">286 J Archaeol Res (201 3) 2 1 :269-306 pieces were deliberately engraved with a geometric cross-hatched pattern and have been securely dated at about 70,000-77,000 years ago (Henshilwood et al. 2002). Notably, many scholars consider the Biombos ochres as the most ancient instances of Paleolithic art and symbolism (D'Errico et al. 2003, p. 4; Henshilwood et al. 2009; Knight 2010; Zilhão 2007). Parallel to the reassessment of nonfigurative images is the réévaluation of figurative art. As we argued above, during most of the 20th century figurative cave paintings were placed at the crown of Paleolithic art. It is not just that most attention was paid to cave art but that realistic cave paintings were interpreted as the culmination of prehistoric art. Breuil, Laming-Emperaire, and Leroi-Gourhan suggested that Paleolithic art had evolved from simple beginnings to very realistic forms. In this schema, the highly figurative images of Altamira and Niaux were considered the end of a long history of attempts to create naturalistic depictions. Recent discoveries, however, have demonstrated the existence of very sophisticated figurative art since the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic. In particular, the dating of the Grotte Chauvet has provoked a revolution in the study of cave art (Fig. 4). This French site was discovered in December 1994. At the end of the cave, there is an area decorated with realistic black paintings of felines, horses, rhinoceroses, and other animals. On the basis of stylistic criteria, these representations were initially assigned to the Solutrean (i.e., 17,000-21,000 years BP, see Clottes in Leroi- Fig. 3 Biombos ochres (photograph by and reproduced with Chris Henshilwood and Francesco D'Errico' s permission) Ô Springer</page><page sequence="19">J Archaeol Res (201 3) 2 1 :269-306 287 Gourhan 1965-1995, p. 572). In this setting, the AMS radiocarbon dating of two rhinoceroses (32,410 ± 720 BP - Gif A 95132 and 30,940 ± 610 BP - Gif A 95126) and a bison (30,340 ± 570 - Gif A 95128) surprised many specialists (Chauvet et al. 1995; Clottes 1996; Clottes et al. 1995; Pettitt and Bahn 2003; Valladas et al. 2001; Züchner 1996). After all, these dates made Chauvet the earliest cave art known in Europe. Although AMS radiocarbon dating is not without problems (Pettitt and Pike 2007), the numerous dates published since the discovery of the cave confirm an age of about 32,000 years BP (Cuzange et al. 2007; Clottes and Geneste 2012). The main corollary of these dates is that Paleolithic art did not progress toward figurative art. On the contrary, figurative art was one representa- tional system among others, including personal adornments, symbolic systems produced on perishable materials (such as clothing or body paintings), ethnic markers, and geometric signs. The current reexamination of figurative and nonfigurative images illustrates recent developments in the conceptualization of prehistoric images. Related to these changes are "the regular and repeated attempts to consider the image-making of Upper Paleolithic periods as being beyond art" (Conkey 2009, p. 174). In the last 30 years, an increasing number of authors have criticized the use of the term "art" to define Pleistocene representations. They have argued that this category, so intrinsically linked to the Western ideas of aesthetics and beauty, cannot accommodate the great diversity of media, subject matter, images, techniques, and visual conventions that make up Paleolithic visual cultures (e.g., Conkey 1987, p. 413; Layton 1991, pp. 1-6; Odak 1991, 1992; Soffer and Conkey 1997, pp. 2-3; Tomášková 1997, pp. 268-269; White 1992, p. 538). They have proposed to replace the label of "art" with other terms (such as visual culture, imagery, and material representation) that may incorporate more kinds of images into the analysis of the material and social life of hunter-gatherer groups. Whereas some scholars (mainly art historians) still consider "art" a legitimate word (e.g., Blocker 1994; Heyd 2005; Lorblanchet 1992; Whitley 2001), modern research has integrated an impressive Fig. 4 Grotte Chauvet (photogaph by and reproduced with Jean Clottes' permission) Springer</page><page sequence="20">288 J Archaeol Res (20 13) 21 :269-306 variety of representations in the study of prehistoric artistic and symbolic systems, including colorants (Barham 2002; Guineau et al. 2001; Hovers et al. 2003; Zilhão et al. 2010), finger flutings (Sharpe 2004; Sharpe and Van Gelder 2006), portable representational objects (Farbstein 201 1; Tosello 2003; White 1992, 2006), negative hand prints (Clottes and Courtin 1994; Von Petzinger and Nowell 201 1), ornaments (Vanhaeren and D'Errico 2006; White 1999, 2007), nonfigurative signs (Cole and Watchman 2005; Henshilwood et al. 2001, 2009; Sauvet 1990), and cupules (Bednarik 2008). The diversification of approaches to Paleolithic imagery and symbolism The globalization of Paleolithic art studies has thus revealed an enormous diversity of designs, marks, themes, material forms, symbolic repertoires, and visual devices associated with Pleistocene societies. Furthermore, the operating concepts for analyzing and interpreting Paleolithic art have expanded, enlarged, and become more complex. As a result of these processes, approaches to Paleolithic visual cultures also have diversified in the last decades. As more and more images and objects are grouped together under the label of Paleolithic art, the number of scholars interested in Pleistocene artwork has significantly increased, as has the number of discussions and debates about Paleolithic representations. Here we consider how new approaches to Paleolithic art reflect current theoretical debates on hunter-gatherer material culture. Few areas have generated more discussion in Paleolithic art than paleoanthro- pology and human evolution. In particular, personal ornaments have played an essential role in contemporary debates on the origins of modern human behavior. Until very recently, behavioral modernity was unanimously linked to the arrival of anatomically modern people to Europe at the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic (e.g., Bar- Yosef 2002, 2007; Jelinek 1994; Klein 1994, 2000; Mellars 1989, 2005; Noble and Davidson 1993; White 1982). According to this model, known as the human revolution, Homo sapiens was the only hominid species with the cognitive hardware necessary to create and develop modern cultural innovations. Since the 2000s, however, a number of archaeologists have proposed the multiple-species model for explaining the origins of behavioral complexity (D'Errico et al. 1998, 2003; Soressi and D'Errico 2007; Vanhaeren 2005; Vanhaeren and D'Errico 2006; Zilhão 2007). This model suggests that Neanderthals were able to develop most of the features defining cultural modernity, including art and symbolism. According to these authors, the primary evidence for Neanderthals' artistic abilities lies in the presence of ornaments in a number of archaeological strata containing Neanderthal remains (D'Errico et al. 1998). Although there is no consensus about whether Neanderthals created artwork, this debate highlights the current revalorization of personal ornaments. During most of the 20th century, these items were regarded as trinkets merely devoted to embellish their owners' appearance (White 1992, p. 539). As a result, personal ornaments were typically excluded from most explanations concerning art and symbolism. This situation began to change in the 1990s when due to the influence of the literature on the archaeology of the body and anthropological views on ornamentation, prehistoric ornaments began to be â Springer</page><page sequence="21">J Archaeol Res (2013) 21 :269-306 289 considered differently. Newell et al. (1990) published a pioneering study on the ethnical dimensions of Mesolithic ornaments. Davidson and Noble (1992) showed that in a context in which communication involved the use of arbitrary signs, beads might indicate membership within or among hunter-gatherer groups. Taborin (1993) published a monumental study on Paleolithic shell ornamentation. In the same period, White (1992, 1993, 1995) devoted several studies to the technical bases of Upper-Paleolithic ornamentation. At the turn of the 21st century, Kuhn et al. (1999, 2001) and Stiner (1999) published their work on beads from the Riparo Mochi and Ûçagizli cave. These works have stimulated a rich literature on the many social, symbolic, and cultural dimensions associated with personal ornaments (e.g., Bvocho 2005; Hill et al. 2009; Kuhn and Stiner 2007; Soressi and D'Errico 2007; Taborin 2004). In this context, personal ornaments have been described as artifacts that define exchange networks (Alvarez Fernández 2002; D'Errico and Vanhaeren 2002; Vanhaeren et al. 2004), conveyors of ethnic, social, and personal identity (Vanhaeren 2005; Zilhão 2007), ethnic markers (Boyd and Richerson 1987; McElreath et al. 2003; Nettle and Dunbar 1997), and items that reflect changing technological and economic conditions (Kuhn and Stiner 2007; White 1995). Discussions of prehistoric imagery have equally played an important role in cognitive archaeology. This field emerged in the 1980s as the branch of archaeology that aspired to deal with the development of human cognition in a scientific manner (Renfrew 1998, p. 2). Although cognitive archaeology was not far from certain postprocessual approaches to symbols, the discipline was founded on an evolutionist-processual approach to material culture (Donald 1991; Renfrew 1982; Renfrew and Zubrow 1994; Renfrew et al. 1993). Since it is widely accepted that images constitute the best archaeological evidence to explore human cognitive evolution (Malafouris 2007, p. 291; Renfrew 1998, p. 2), much of the recent discussion on this topic has centered on the development of the human capacity to create artistic and symbolic representations. Although there is no consensus about when and why this faculty first appeared, there is widespread agreement that Pleistocene images are precious for exploring the origins of human creativity (Mithen 1998; Turner 2006; Whitley 2009), symbolization (Henshilwood et al. 2001; Meilars 1996; Reuland 2005), language (Botha 2007; Davidson 1996; Deacon 1997; D'Errico 1995; D'Errico and Vanhaeren 2009; D'Errico et al. 2003; Henshilwood and Dubreuil 2009; Layton 2007; Mithen 2005), memory (Coolidge and Wynn 2005; D'Errico 1998; Wynn and Coolidge 2010), perception (Davidson and Noble 1989; Hodgson 2000; Ouzman 1998), imagination (Mithen 2000; Renfrew and Morley 2007), and musicality (D'Errico et al. 2003; Morley 2009). In addition, different kinds of prehistoric artwork have recently been examined through the lens of cognitive archaeology and neurosciences, including rock art (Whitley 1998), cave paintings (Hodgson 2008; Malafouris 2007; Onians 2007), statuettes and carvings (Wynn et al. 2009), anthropomorphic images (Svoboda 2007), animal representations (Hodgson and Helvenston 2006), and beads (Malafouris 2008). Technological studies also have benefited from a greater attention to Paleolithic images and representations. Advances in technology have been linked mainly to recent developments in lithic studies. In this field, a new generation of scholars has raised serious doubts about traditional morphological approaches to lithic Springer</page><page sequence="22">290 J Archaeol Res (2013) 21:269-306 assemblages based on the construction of cultural taxonomies (e.g., Bar-Yosef and Van Peer 2009; Boëda 1995; Pelegrin 1990). These researchers have argued that the many social, cultural, and economical dimensions of lithic technology can only be understood from a more theoretically oriented approach. For this reason, they have examined the cognitive processes involved in tool making (Ambrose 2010; McPherron 2000; Nowell 2010; Nowell and Davidson 2010; Schlanger 1996; Stout et al. 2008), the links between Paleolithic technology and human evolution (Ambrose 2001; Gibson and Ingold 1993; Stout and Chaminade 2009), the study of how stone tools were produced (Bar-Yosef and Van Peer 2009; Hopkinson 2011), and the social and cultural dimensions of lithic technology (Dobres 1999, 2000; Sinclair 2000). Since the making of prehistoric artwork is situated within particular technologies, similar kinds of questions have been extended to the analysis of Paleolithic imagery. In fact, it is not by chance that archaeologists have applied concepts and methods first developed in lithic studies to the analysis of Paleolithic representations. They have analyzed Paleolithic portable imagery through the lens of the chaîne opératoire approach (Farbstein 2011; White 1995) and have used optical and scanning electron microscopy for understanding the making of personal ornaments (e.g., D'Errico and Villa 1997; White 2006, 2007). Furthermore, technological studies have examined cave images and portable representations from new perspectives, including the technological processes involved in the making of Paleolithic images (Álvarez et al. 2001; Chalmin et al. 2003; Dobres 2001; Fritz 1999a), the links between materiality and the making of meaning (Conkey 2009; Dobres 2001), and the social processes influencing Paleolithic artists' choices (Dobres 1999; Fritz 1999b; Soffer 2000; Soffer et al. 2000). Together with these new perspectives, more conventional approaches are still playing a significant role in Paleolithic art research. Regional studies (Corchón Rodríguez 1997; Delluc and Delluc 1991; Delporte and Clottes 1996; González Sáinz 1989; Vialou 1986), new discoveries (Arias et al. 1999; Bahn 1995; Clottes 1995; Clottes and Courtin 2005; Conard 2003, 2009; Geneste 2005; Pettitt et al. 2008), new perspectives on old sites (Aujoulat 2004; Bégouën et al. 2009; Clottes 2010; Delluc and Delluc 2003), methodological advances in the recording, analyzing, and dating of Paleolithic images (Bahn 2003; Fritz and Tosello 2007; Lorblanchet and Bahn 1993; Pastoors and Weniger 2010), and studies on the geographical and spatial distribution of Paleolithic art (Chippindale and Nash 2004; Fritz et al. 2007; Gamble 1986; Ross 2001) all continue to enrich the field of Paleolithic visual cultures. As a result, Paleolithic art studies are a dynamic and multidisciplinary area that has incorporated many activities, practices, and ideas from other disciplines. The challenge is to determine whether these recent developments are defining what could constitute a paradigm shift in the conceptualization of Paleolithic images. Conclusion The question of whether we are moving toward a new conceptualization of Paleolithic images is complex, since there are signs indicating both the persistence â Springer</page><page sequence="23">J Archaeol Res (20 13) 21 :269-306 29 1 of traditional categories and the impact of new explanatory models. As textual analysis demonstrates, concepts such as rock art, cave art, and portable art are still the primary ways of classifying Paleolithic artwork in dictionaries, encyclopedias, textbooks, and specialized books. After many years of use, these terms have become widely accepted by scholars and the general public. In this heuristic and practical sense, these categories are sanctioned-by-tradition ways of referring to prehistoric art that have proved to be useful in many ways. At the same time, we are entering a new period marked by a rapid diversification of approaches to Paleolithic visual imagery, a growing self-consciousness concerning the underlying assumptions involved in our interpretations, and new ontological and epistemological issues about the multiple meanings of prehistoric representations. The increasing globalization of the field, the impact of recent discoveries, advances in technical methodologies, and the emergence of new approaches to art, images, and symbolism are defining new frameworks in which a single classification, such as the parietal/ portable dichotomy, does not play an all-encompassing role. In fact, contemporary research on Pleistocene visual cultures is so global and fragmentary that it is difficult to foresee the emergence of a new unified program or paradigm. As has happened with many other disciplines, Paleolithic art studies have entered an age marked by the diversity and multiplicity of approaches and perspectives. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that an increasing number of categories, terms, concepts, and ideas will be applied to the description, analysis, and interpretation of Pleistocene images in the coming years. In this fluctuating context, the history of archaeology can contribute to modern research by reminding scholars that their ways of conceptualizing Pleistocene images are not timeless classifications. The main categories involved in the understanding of prehistoric images are always the product of social universes that are historically situated and dated, whether the universe is the social context of the bourgeois society at the end of the 19th century or the technological and globalized world at the beginning of the 21st century. Archaeologists, like other scientists, tend to forget the historical origins of their concepts. This is what Bourdieu (1996, p. 297) calls "genesis amnesia," i.e., the transformation of social and cultural distinctions, such as the parietal/portable dichotomy, into natural ones. Against amnesia, scholars need to be acutely aware of their own subjectivities and influences in their interpretative strategies. In this sense, the history of archaeology can help scientists better understand the social mechanisms that orient their practices. It was in the hope of contributing to this reflexivity that this cultural history was written.
