<plain_text><page sequence="1">Origin of the Punnett Square Lawrence C. Davis W HEN we teach material directly from stan- dard textbooks, we and our students often miss out on some of the most interesting aspects of the scientific process. How things came to be the way they are is an intriguing part of science. When I was in school, what is now called the Punnett square was called the checkerboard or chessboard method. Curious about how it came to be called a Punnett square, I did a little digging into old text- books. I found that the original description of the method by Punnett was clearer than the usual pre- sentation and that in addition, Punnett, following earlier sweet pea breeders, provided some marvelous imagery that facilitates remembering phenotypes. This in turn should help the learning process. The studies of Bateson and Punnett, described here, also provided the first clear example of linked genes. Reginald Crundall Punnett was born in 1875 and, after a classical education, went to work with William Bateson at Cambridge University about 1903. To- gether with Miss E.L. Saunders, Bateson and Punnett provided much of the earliest evidence for Mendelian inheritance in animals and plants other than edible peas. Punnett became the first Professor of Genetics at Cambridge (1912) and was an expert in poultry genetics. He wrote a number of papers and books on genetics and was a strong supporter of Mendelism, a position which says that all observed traits are caused by heritable characters (genes) that are not acquired as a result of experience but are directly transmitted through germ cells to yield gametes. Punnett clearly saw the implications of Mendelism for all higher organisms as shown by the following quote from his book, Mendelism. People generally look upon the human species as having two kinds of individuals, males and females, and it is for them that the sociologists and legislators frame their schemes. This, however, is but an imperfect view to take of ourselves. In reality we are of four kinds, male zygotes and female zygotes, large gametes and small gametes, and heredity is the link that binds us all together. Further elaboration on this theme led Punnett to a position very like that of modern proponents of "the selfish gene." In closing his book he said, ... there can be little doubt that the future of our civiliza- tion, perhaps even the possibility of a future at all, is wrapped up with the recognition we accord to those who live unseen and inarticulate within us-the fateful race of ga- metes so irrevocably bound to us by that closest of all ties, heredity.

I suspect that he appreciated the anthropomorphic imagery used by the sweet pea breeders. Actors in the Play What do you expect for the offspring when the mother is a Painted Lady and the father is a Duke of Westminster? As a clue I should tell you that the phenotype of the Painted Lady is erect red and the Duke is hooded purple. Erect is dominant to hooded, and purple is dominant to red. So the offspring must be Purple Invincible, right? Now what happens if two Purple Invincibles are crossed? As a further clue I should tell you that all the above names apply to strains of sweet peas, and that the color and standard shape are traits controlled by single genes (Figure 1). To solve this problem it is easiest to construct what is commonly called a Punnett square. Why call it a Punnett square? In order to think about the independent assortment of characters in the gametes, Punnett devised for the 3rd edition of Mendelism a compact method of writing out all the possible combinations of gametes. He called it a "chessboard," but we call it the Punnett square, in recognition of his contribution. However, about the time that it got its new name (1950-1960), it lost its best feature, which is to directly transcribe the exact gamete type into every cell (=zygote) of the square. Lawrence C. Davis, Ph.D., is professor of biochemistry at Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS 66506. PUNNETr SQUARE 209</page><page sequence="2">Punnelft's Original (1911) Method Figure 2 illustrates Punnett's method for the two traits mentioned above. Purple is produced by a dominant blue factor in flowers with a red back- ground so the symbol is B. Erect standard is domi- nant over hooded so the symbol is E. In a double heterozygote there will be four possible gamete types, making 16 cells in a 4x4 array. Write the gamete types in the same order on both the horizon- tal and vertical of the square, and put the dominant genotype(s) to the upper or left position. This is convenient for keeping track of what you are doing but it is not required by any mathematical law. It has the virtue of making the double recessive and the double dominant show up far away from each other, with the mixed forms in-between. Once you have set up the square, copy the gamete types into the appropriate row or column to give two gamete types, one from each parent, in each of the cells (=zygotes) of the square. If you want you may use two colors of pencil for the copying, one to represent the rows (one parent) and the other the columns (the other parent). Now you should be able to read off the expected phenotype of every cell in the square, based on what you know about the dominant or recessive nature of the two loci. Even if you don't know what phenotype to expect for each combina- tion, at least you can make a summary of the number of each zygote type that is expected. This predicted frequency can be compared with an observed pheno- typic frequency to test a model. A chi squared test is a common way to do this. Punnett's approach of directly copying gametes into the square requires a bit more work than the usual textbook illustration, which simply strings all the alleles one after the other, but it leads to a better understanding of what is going on. If more than two symbols or traits are being considered, the advantage is more obvious. When there are multiple alleles at a single locus as with blood types, carefully following these instructions for the Punnett square will let one read out the possible genotypes accurately. There are at least five unlinked factors for flower color in sweet peas. Having to fill in cells simply by just looking at row and column headings is a big stumbling block for students who are not confident of the math concept that explains why the square should work. Punnett's original method shows the exact expected genotype of each expected progeny, which makes it easy to compare with the original parental genotypes. (For work with yeast, the notation of over and under for the gamete types also corresponds to the way that yeast geneticists express genotypes. Sticking with the same notation makes one less thing for students to worry about in solving a problem). Almost every student could be trained to do the operations given in the instructions. Understanding what it means about heredity and why certain ratios of progeny numbers show up is much harder, but making the operations easy allows more time for working on concepts. The Concept of Linkage, How Traits Travel Together Getting back to the original question of what you get in mating a Painted Lady and a Duke of West- minster, the answer is not what you might think. It turns out that the two traits, standard shape and color in sweet pea flowers, are tightly linked. If particular alleles for two traits of interest are close together on the same chromosome, Punnett said they are "in coupling." If they are found on opposite chromosomes of a pair, they are said to be "in repulsion." The genes are "in repulsion" in the pedigree described here so that the Figure 2 offspring are pure Painted Ladies, Purple Invincible and pure Duke of Westminster in a ratio of 1:2:1. Purple Invincible continues to give rise to the other two in every generation. That implies that each parent has a homozygous pair of chromosomes, each with either eB (Duke of Westminster) or Eb (Painted Lady). The Figure 1 Purple Invincible is the heterozygote with one chromosome each of eB and Eb. This linkage effect makes for a much smaller Punnett square, just 2x2 (Figure 3). Once in a long while the linkage is broken, but Bateson and Punnett never found such separation in this pedigree over the course of several years of work with several thousand plants. For two other strains of sweet peas with the same traits initially "in coupling," they found a breaking of that linkage at about 1/128 frequency. So the product of two independent gametic crossover events each yielding "coupled" recessive traits in the present pedigree would be found only once in 15,000. They didn't analyze enough plants to find such a rare occurrence. For other factors such as pollen shape they did observe partial linkage, ranging from fully linked to completely unlinked. Bateson and Punnett were the first workers to analyze linkage, but it was T.H. Morgan, working with fruitflies, who explained what causes it (chro- mosomes). Still, it is a fitting tribute to Punnett that we call the method that he developed for comparing gametes and zygotes a Punnett square. If the two traits, purple and erectness, were inde- pendently assorting, one would expect that 1/16 of all offspring of Purple Invincible would be hooded red. We could use a chi square test to predict the likeli- hood of not finding this class among 5789 plants observed by Bateson and Punnett. They got 1379 hooded purple (2eB), 1441 erect red (2Eb) and 2969 erect purple (eB, Eb). The chi square will let us test these numbers against a model of 9:3:3:1 assortment 240 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, VOWME 55, NO. 4, APRIL 1993</page><page sequence="3">EB Eb eB eb EB EB Eb eB eb EB EB EB EB Eb EB Eb e7 EB eb Eb Eb Eb Eb eB EB Eb eB eb_ eB eB eB eB eb EB Eb. eB eb__ eb eb X eb eb 41 Figure 2.

For a model of complete linkage the chi squared is just 5.1, which predicts a distribution of offspring cited here happens about 5 percent of the time. For a 9:3:3:1 model the chi squared is more than 500, indicating essentially no chance that it is a realistic model. Notice that in this case even the presumably correct model does not fit the results very well. Indeed such a distribution only occurs one in 20 times. I think the answer may be that there is a slight chance of misclassification of the hooded purple as erect pur- ple. The expected numbers are 2895 and 1447 for erect and hooded respectively. So if 5 percent of the hooded purples were mistakenly called erect, we could account for the observed results almost per- fectly. There is also a possibility that gametes or seeds carrying the hooded trait are somewhat less viable. We know from the work of Bateson and Punnett that pollen shape is linked to the color genes. There could be other genes for pollen function also linked, be- cause Bateson and Punnett found some irregular and inconsistent results when studying linkage of pollen shape and flower color with some classes of progeny being deficient in some pedigrees. Other Members of the Family In case you are interested, the hooded character was inherited from a white flowered Blanche Burpee which has some essential color factors absent while complementary color factors were introduced by the white flowered Emily Henderson. These two give rise to the Purple Invincible directly, along with the Painted Lady and some whites. (We now understand that white is the recessive absence of any one of several enzymes in the path to make colors; presum- ably Blanche Burpee and Emily Henderson lack dif- ferent enzymes of the pathway.) The Duke of Suther- land, hooded purple with dark wings, and Miss Hunt, erect red standard with red wings, were also part of the family, expressing factors for intense color and color in the wings. The missing member is what we might name Little Red Riding Hood, a hooded red. Eb eB Eb Eb eB Eb Eb eB Eb eB eB eB Figure 3.

Even the term "cell" is the same. If you feel ambitious you could write a pro- gram that would identify the phenotypes for you based on the genotypes entered into the cells. This would save a lot of work in a tetrahybrid cross, for instance. For most purposes though, it is hard to beat Punnett's original method using pencil and paper.
