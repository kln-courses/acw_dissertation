Leuven and Dudley, MA: Peeters, 2003. isbn 90 429 1283 9. €65. The great merit of this study is its careful attention to exactly what Chrysostom was doing in his homiletic exegesis of Noah and the Flood, and its remarkable trawling of other early Christian exegetical treatment of this narrative in order to trace similarities and differences in traditions of interpretation. The book is the published version of an Oxford D.Phil, thesis presented in the sub-faculty of Ancient History. The author rightly contends that 'patristic literature is not only the business of theologians, but of all who are interested in the propagation of ideas in late antiquity' (p. 3). He also stresses the important point that Christian rhetoric evidences not only the impact of the classical corpus, but also that of an 'additional set of rules, defined by the unique framework of the Scriptures' (p. 4). Other interesting features of the book are: (a) the demonstration that the homilist was as much the scholar as the commentator (pace Theodore's well-known comment); (b) the reaction against audience-oriented readings of Chrysostom. The book is divided into two parts, and it is the second part which most impresses. Three chapters (6-8) each take one of Chrysostom's Homilies on Genesis (22-4): the content of each is surveyed through paraphrase, and then there follows verse-by-verse discussion, pursuing the details of the text and how they are treated, first by Chrysostom, then by other 'Antiochenes', then by 'Alexandrians'. Brief concluding chapters follow on 'The Rhetorical Application of Scripture' and 'Biblical Exegesis in its Historical Dimension'. Part I surveys a range of introductory questions: 'Chrysostom and his Time', 'Ancient Exegesis and Scholarship', 'The Texts', and 'Chrysostom's Bible'. In the three core chapters the careful and meticulous examination of the texts enables some fascinating observations. A few examples will illustrate this: i. The nature of the 'sons of God' and 'daughters of men' in Gen. 6:2 was a matter of debate. Chrysostom follows a tradition traced back to Julius Africanus and found in Eusebius of Emesa, Theodore of Mopsuestia, Theodoret of Cyrrhus, and Gennadius that the 'sons of God' are human beings and descendants of Seth. ) The Author 2006.

By contrast Origen, along with Philo, Didymus, and Eusebius of Caesarea, identify the 'sons of God' as angels, demons, or souls, and this leads to a very different reading with different problema tics. This example demonstrates variant Antiochene and Alexandrian traditions of identifying the reference; one wonders how far these variant traditions reflect differing reactions against the Sethian Gnostics, but the author never raises that issue. 2. The question of the identity of the giants in Gen. 6:2 suggests a large range of possibilities—too many to summarize. Suffice it to say that the Antiochenes present a number of different ideas, many found also among Alexandrians; while Origen stands out from the other Alexandrians in suggesting their supernatural character. All alike focus on pedagogical and moral lessons to be drawn. Where the first example would largely fit the standard contrast between schools this does not. 3. Gen. 6:6 mentions God's anger, and here we have an example of the anti-anthropomorphic exegesis of all players; and several, across the conventional divide, find Gen. 6:7, the decision to destroy man and beast, raising the question of God's providence. Here as elsewhere the documentation of traditions of biblical cross-reference is particularly interesting. These examples reinforce the point that the perceived reference of the text and biblical cross-references are funda mental to patristic exposition. Furthermore the material reminds us that there was actual debate about meaning and reference, even between members of the same 'school', as well as consistent traditions of associating one biblical text with another. As hinted, the main weakness of this book is its reliance on the contrast between Antiochene and Alexandrian schools. The author admits that a sharp contrast has been contested of late, but insists that they themselves differentiated their position. Of course, we do find among the Antiochenes a polemic against allegory as such, certainly as practised and justified by certain Alexandrians, notably Origen; but continuing to characterize the Antiochenes as distinctively interested in history, or the literal or plain sense of the text, is not only problematic in the light of recent discussion but is often not borne out by the author's own detailed discussions when the texts are examined. A few examples should make the point: i. Cyril of Alexandria is classed as an Alexandrian, but on a particular point proves an exception to the rule (p. 93). It has long been noted that the contrast between the two 'schools' fails</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 295 to provide an account of Cyril's exegesis, as of that of the Cappadocians. Both are sometimes called 'hybrid'; but a better way of dealing with this is to recognize there is a common 'philological' basis to ancient exegesis within which there were debates about particular reference. 2. It is acknowledged (p. 230) that there are 'numerous examples of exegetical common ground between Didymus and Chrysostom [which] cannot be attributed to accidental circumstances'. The possibility of a common source points to Origen. So 'the overall impression which one gets from the comparative study of both Antiochene and Alexandrian texts is that the Antiochenes may have been exposed to the work of rival exegetes far more than is usually assumed'. 3. Both traditions of exegesis had an anti-anthropomorphic and pedagogic thrust. This is shown time and time again, as is the common concern to deal with heretics such as the Marcionites. It was vital for all to defend God's providential action and deduce morals from the text. 4. The actual material forces the conclusion that the Antiochenes too manipulated the text, rather than taking it literally (e.g. p. 196). Despite this, the book is a valuable contribution to an increasingly important area of research. Unfortunately, there are a number of misprints. doi:10.1093/jts/flll58 FRANCES YOUNG Advance Access publication 21 November 2006 Birmingham fmyoung@lineone.net Frances Young</page></plain_text>
