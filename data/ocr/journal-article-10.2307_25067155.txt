<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Pictures (the Most Part Bawdy)": The Anglo-Japanese Painting Trade in the Early 1600s Timon Screech A most curious experiment was undertaken in the early sev enteenth century by the English East India Company: it de cided to deal in pictures through some of its Asian factories (or trading stations). The company, founded in 1600, was anxious to find appropriate items for sale in its newly ac quired outlets. Pictures appeared to be a propitious commod ity. This paper can examine the case of only one factory in detail, that in Japan, although, as will be proven below, the largest shipment taken there went via India, and the rever berations in that country's station must also be addressed. The English East India Company had received its trading rights to India in 1612 and to Japan in 1613. The arrival of pictures from England did not mark the first Japanese en counter with European art. Portuguese and Spanish mission aries, and accompanying traders, had come in the 1540s; the Dutch had followed in 1600, their presence formalized nine years later after the creation of the United (or Dutch) East India Company, known from its Dutch acronym as the VOC. The Iberians imported religious works for proselytizing pur poses and also established a Western-style studio, grandly named the Academy of St. Luke, run by a Venetian, Giovanni di Niccolo.1 In addition, a Jesuit press in Japan turned out books and prints. But these would have had little function beyond the spaces of public and private piety, and few non devotional paintings or prints were imported or produced locally. Hybrid forms evolved (known today as nanban art), often secular, but these shared little with actual imports. The VOC did not deal in art at this point in its history. Thus, the pictures from England were the first items of their kind to be seen in Japan. The company's flirtation with pictures may seem perverse, and it proved to be unprofitable. However, if the story that follows would not merit telling under the rubric of England's rise to mercantile supremacy?in which the whole Japan episode, though not, of course, the Indian one, was negligi ble?it is nevertheless fascinating when viewed from other standpoints, notably that of the history of art. Nevertheless, the experiment has not been comprehensively discussed un til now?indeed, it has been totally forgotten. That pictures from England were in India is better known, and this has been referred to as "one of the most intriguing artistic ex changes of early modern history," yet the case of Japan has been utterly excluded.2 This paper retrieves a lost moment in the history of art exchange. But it seeks to go beyond the merely archival. Our larger theme is the meaning and serviceability of visual rep resentations across cultures, in an early period of interna tional awareness. Relevant questions include how consciously the English were presenting themselves via their exports, and what visual or political points they were trying to achieve. Conversely, on what grounds were Japanese pieces selected for import? Beyond the commodity items, several pictures privately owned by company staff were taken to Japan and shown there. And Japanese potentates, responding to pres ents, sent gifts of paintings to English nobles, too. It is by laying out this evidence, and by broaching issues of represen tation and self-representation, that the painting-trade exper iment, despite its swift abandonment, can lay claim to impor tance within the current discipline of art history. The Company The English East India Company's stock-in-trade was broad cloth, that is, thick, lower-grade woolens; to a lesser extent, in Japan at least, it also purveyed military supplies. Given the severity of Japanese winters, the wool ought to have sold, and the company officers were perplexed that it did not. Perhaps the quality was poor; perhaps the colors were wrong; perhaps the problem lay in fashion (a concept the English were little prepared for), as things might sell one year but languish the next.3 Warfare had been endemic in Japan since the close of the fifteenth century, which allowed for trading opportunities in armaments. In 1603, the Tokugawa family succeeded to the defunct title of shogun, under their patriarch Ieyasu, al though they remained no more than primus inter pares of competing daimyo (warlords) when the English arrived. Just two years later, in 1615, the Tokugawa destroyed their prin cipal rivals, the Toyotomi. This rout was achieved in large measure with gunpowder and lead shot sold them by the English, and the company records become briefly elated at the filling up of its coffers.4 Peace killed off the other half of the English trade, though, and further importation of weap onry was discouraged as destabilizing. Both mainstays of busi ness fell into the doldrums. However buoyant the painting market had been, it could never have carried the whole factory. After a decade of strug gle, the station closed. Its head factor, as he pulled out in 1623, wrote optimistically, "if the next yeare shall produce any better encouragement, maybe then [we will] returne againe."5 But Oliver Cromwell and the Civil War interposed, precluding further efforts. In London, the English East India Company was based in Philpot Lane, off Fenchurch Street. A sailing to Japan had been first proposed at a meeting of its governing body, called its Court, in 1611. This was to be part of the eighth company expedition eastward, then being prepared, in three vessels, under the lead of the brand-new, eighty-one-man Clove. Little of the shogun's realm was known in London, and not much more in the company's intervening Asian factories. The Court, however, had in its hands a memorandum entitled "Observations of Commodities to be Bought and Sold in Japan," written by John Saris (pronounced sair'iss), an agent recently returned from four years' residence at Bantam, on Java, the company's chief overseas base. It is uncertain how</page><page sequence="2">THE ANGLO-JAPANESE PAINTING TRADE IN THE EARLY 1600S 51 he came by his opinions, but Saris recommended an array of items, from the wool and lead without which no English enterprise could function to velvet, gilded leather, women's makeup, tapestries, and "painted pictures."6 With this infor mation, the company felt emboldened to enter into compe tition with the Iberians and with the VOC, and thus make its first sailing to Japan. It so happened that a top VOC merchant in Japan was English. Formerly of the London Levant Company, William Adams had relocated to Amsterdam, where skilled English mariners were in demand, and arrived in Japan on the first Dutch ship, the Liefde (Charity), which entered (in wrecked condition), in 1600. Adams never returned to Europe. His story has often been told and is famously fictionalized in the novel, film, and video game Shogun? As a Dutch employee, he could not be overly enthusiastic toward his compatriots, but in January 1613, already an old Japan hand, and even on terms of some friendship with Ieyasu, Adams wrote to Bantam to encourage the English to come: "I boldly say our country men shalbe so welcom and free in comparissonn as in the river of London."8 Welcomed by the Japanese that is, not by the Dutch or Iberians. When the letter arrived, the Clove had already left Bantam and was speeding to Japan. It docked in mid-June 1613, crew and cargo safe and sound. That the Clove came on alone of the three ships, notwithstanding fables of mountains of Japanese gold, reveals that expectations were none too high. In fact, the real objective was to find a foothold to trade with the Great Ming (China). Until such time, there was hope that a Japan factory might pay its way. The Cloves captain was James Fister. Its cape-merchant, or head of expedition, was none other than Saris, who had positioned himself in the running with his "Observations." Saris had been directed by the Court to investigate Japanese market conditions for wool, lead, "and such other of our native commodities as by your observaci?n you shall finde most vendible there."9 The Cloves cargo invoice does not survive, but it appears the company officers played safe in what they took out, bringing wool and lead, but little more. They wanted confirmation before dispatching value-added items of the kind that Saris had recommended. Fister and Saris stayed five months before leaving for En gland again. They docked back in Plymouth, in September 1615, leaving behind a team of some dozen men under Richard Cocks, as chief factor, described (to James I, no less) as "though not lettered yet a man of honesty, years and judgment."10 The evaluation turned out to be wide of the mark, but Cocks controlled the show for the entire period of the factory's existence. Business had been set up on Hirado, a small island off the coast of Kyushu, in southern Japan. This was far from Edo (modern Tokyo), the Tokugawa base, or Osaka, the base of the Toyotomi. Hirado was chosen on the curious grounds that the VOC was already there. The Dutch were doing well enough, and far-from-home mutual assis tance was expected among reformed Christians. Adams, how ever, had argued for a location closer to the center of sho gunal power. For a period of months the cheek-by-jowl companies amalgamated and worked as one.11 Mostly, though, they were rivals, their countries intermittently at war.12 Goods for Japan Back in England, Saris was not permitted to disembark at once, having been indicted on charges of tyrannical behavior toward subordinates and excessive private trade, or, to give it its rightful name, smuggling. Cocks was to be arraigned for the latter, too, a charge often leveled at men in their posi tions. As he lay in Plymouth Sound, Saris wrote up his sug gested goods "vendible" in Japan. He had evidently not used his time there very investigatively, for mostly he just repeated what he had listed in the "Observations," although there is one notable addition: delftware (then called gallipots); its production had only just begun in England, at the Pickleher ring Pottery in Southwark. On arrival in London, Saris went to choose pieces at the site, still known as Potters Fields and now home to City Hall.13 This addition may be of interest to historians of the ceramic trade. Importantly for this paper, the Plymouth list reiterates the recommendation to send paintings, and on the subjects given before. The return of Saris from Japan aroused great excitement. The "contynueall and true journalls" he had been required to keep, initially kept secret for commercial confidentiality, were published, with others of their kind, in the best-selling anthology of travel writing compiled by Samuel Purchas, Purchas His Pilgrimes, of 1621-24. Purchas enthused at how Saris had gone beyond "all justnames of Indian and Asian, penetrating by a long journey the ilands, cities, court of the Japonian Empire; there setleth an English Factorie, and after safe returne, is readie to render thee the pleasure of his paine."14 But Purchas was an editor rather than a transcriber, and he made many changes. His version of Saris's journal differs from the holograph manuscript, which survives, in small but often relevant ways. Yet it was through Purchas, until the modern period, that Saris's writings were circulated. James I is reputed to have read the multivolume work six times; if true, this was quite a feat, as the king died within a year of its completion.15 Purchas also included Saris's "Ob servations," and this is the only evidence for its existence, no manuscript surviving. However, here, too, Purchas edited and, in the process, clearly garbled passages, among them the one recommending pictures.16 When he suggested sending "painted pictures," Saris did not specify what they should look like nor who should pro duce them. It is not possible to do more than speculate about to whom commissions might have been assigned and, thus, the visual appearance of the pictures sent. London was not an especially important picture-making center, though it en joyed a reputation in some types of work, notably, portraits. Painterly talent that was able to address a wider array of themes was largely foreign, generally Netherlandish. Two such painters, Paul van Somer and Daniel Mytens, established their reputations soon after their arrival in the later 1610s, too late for our purposes.17 The king's sergeant-painter, the Dutchman John de Critz, was active, though probably re placed about this time with his fellow countryman Marcus Gheeradts.18 Cornelius Johnson, although English-born, re garded himself as Dutch. The only genuinely English painters whose names are familiar today are John Souch, Nathaniel Bacon (a fine painter, but an aristocrat who painted for amusement), and the elderly Robert Peake, who also worked as the king's painter; Isaac Oliver, also elderly, was well</page><page sequence="3">52 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2005 VOLUME LXXXVII NUMBER 1 known but limited in production to miniatures. As will be seen below, one other name can be advanced. London's monopoly artists' guild, the Worshipful Com pany of Painter-Stainers, established in 1502, was a not-insig nificant entity, and the East India Company can be expected to have referred to it, not least as, since 1532, the guild had operated out of Little Trinity Street, a stone's throw from Philpot Lane (where it remains to this day).19 The Painter Stainers' master was George Hethe; another member, Wil liam Frizelfeild, was designated "the cittie's painter," though no work by either survives.20 On other matters relating to the pictures, Saris was quite specific. He stipulated size, value, and theme. The "Observa tions" suggested pictures be "the larger the better, worth one, two to three hundred";21 the Plymouth list renders this more tightly, and inserts a unit: "the larger the better, worth 2-300 mas."22 The sums would more normally be written one order of magnitude lower, as 10-30, or 20-30, taels. This is money on account, not specie, with a tael made up of 10 mas, or 100 candereen, and valued at about 5 English shillings. Saris's recommendations thus compute to pictures of a minimum of ?2 10/- (two pounds ten shillings) and a maximum of ?7 10/-. As a comparative measure, Saris earned ?40 per annum, while a ship's captain might receive ?75; a company boy could expect only ?5, though that was not a living wage.23 As for the prices paid at the time, there is evidence that a good painting would sell for up to about ?10; at just this period, the earl of Salisbury paid ?33 for a set of four depic tions of the Apostles and Prophets for his chapel, at Hatfield House (these are extant) ; some years later, the same earl paid George Geldop, a Cologne artist resident in London, ?30 for two portraits, one of himself and one of his wife, but these were fine and extremely large.24 A royal commission of 1620 saw James I giving ?26 to Mytens for a portrait.25 Anthony Van Dyck received ?444 for nine portraits, or not quite ?50 each, but that was under the art-loving Charles I, bent on bringing London up to European standards, and probably causing inflation in the process.26 Among lesser artists, we have only post-Civil War evidence: in 1668, Samuel Pepys commissioned two portraits from John Hayls at a cost of ?14 each (plus ?2 10/- for the frames); two years later he ordered a work by the better-known Samuel Cooper (who had painted Cromwell, "warts and all," and was praised by Van Dyck) at ?30.27 In 1625, the fine for undertaking painting without being a Painter-Stainer was ?5, perhaps equivalent to one moderately good picture.28 Saris was clearly arguing for low to goodish-level work. For themes, the published "Observations" informs that the Japanese "delight in lascivious stories of warres by sea and land."29 This must be Purchas's conflation of what reappears more reasonably as two themes in the Plymouth list: Saris recommends pictures "som laciuious, others stories of warrs by sea and land."30 Though little English battle art exists from the early seventeenth century, its general appearance can be imagined. "Lascivious" pictures, in the Jacobean period, probably meant classical nudes. The issue of why eroticized pictures should seem appropriate for Japan is intriguing. Although he had written his "Observations" before going to Japan, Saris had taken a fine specimen of "lascivious" Euro pean art with him on the Clove; this was for his own enjoy ment, not for sale, but in his journal Saris dwelt on the positive reception it enjoyed, surely to give empirical backing to what he had written on a hunch years before. Sending battle pictures to a country at war required less extenuation. Saris's "Lascivious" Painting Saris stated unapologetically that his picture was a Venus "sett in a great frame" and "verye lasiuiously sett out."31 Purchas alters this to "Venus, with her sonne Cupid . . . somewhat wantonly set out in a large frame."32 As cape-merchant, Saris would occupy the roundhouse, or luxury suite beneath the rooms of the captain, looking sternward and well lit with glass windows. The painting was intended to hang in a grand position and was probably new, like the Clove itself, commis sioned in preparation for the voyage, thus likely produced in 1612.33 No similar English piece of the period survives, though a deftly rendered naked Venus appears rather earlier, in a large mythological work of 1569.34 Closer in time may be paintings in the earl of Somerset's collection, now lost and undated in themselves but inventoried in 1615 as Venus and Cupid, Bacchus, Ceres and Venus, and Venus and Adonis.35 It is usually assumed that Somerset's paintings were Dutch, and if Saris's Venus was, too, there are more contenders, most ex citingly Peter Paul Rubens, who often applied his voluptuous manner to mythological subjects, and by whom Venuses (with and without Cupids) from precisely this time are known (Fig. I).36 Rubens's close association with England came later, when Charles I invited him to produce wall and ceiling paintings for his new palace at Whitehall, but he was already known widely.37 Rubens was expensive, but equipping the roundhouse of the cape-merchant on an East India Company voyage was no small commission. If Saris was not the hugely wealthy man he would become on his return from Japan, he was rich enough from his previous stint at Bantam to buy a good painting, if he chose. Ships could sink (though the Clove did not), and the installation of a true masterpiece might be foolhardy. In that case a second-tier Rubens follower can be proposed, such as his former assistant, Jacob Jordaens, fully graduated only in 1615, so modestly priced in 1612. A notch down again would be the work of fellow students of Jordaens with lesser skills, whose names are no longer known.38 Newly docked in Japan, Saris allowed a tour of the Clove by the entourage of the daimyo of Hirado, Matsura Takanobu.39 "Diuers of the better sort of women," he wrote, came aboard; later, the retired daimyo, Matsura Shigenobu, Takanobu's grandfather, did so himself. Shigenobu had been a cele brated warrior in his day and at age seventy-one was still holding the reins of state for his ineffective grandson (his son, Hisanobu, had predeceased him) .40 Intercourse was nec essarily stilted. Although there was one English-speaking Jap anese, engaged by Saris at Bantam and referred to as John Japan, he was apparently not present to help in explicating the painting.41 A singular misunderstanding occurred. The sequestered ladies took the Venus for the Virgin Mary. Pur chas, having given the subject of the painting as Venus and Cupid, glosses that the women mistook it for a Virgin and Child; he also inserted the comment, which both explains and compounds the error, that the women were Christians. This was not impossible, though it is not what Saris had written, and there is little other evidence of converts at the Hirado</page><page sequence="4">THE ANGLO-JAPANESE PAINTING TRADE IN THE EARLY 1600S 53 1 Peter Paul Rubens, The Toilet of Venus, oil on canvas, ca. 1612. Madrid, Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza (photo: ? Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza) ML court.42 Unrecorded are the reactions of Shigenobu, regret tably, as he enjoyed a reputation for lusty behavior; the English would later nickname him Lucullus, after the orgy going Roman statesman.43 This Venus would have left with Saris, and the two short tours of the Clove may have been the only times it was viewed by Japanese people. After the Clove returned to England, it went once more to Bantam, but not on to Japan, and anyway, the painting would no longer have been aboard.44 But the encounter was not forgotten. It was returned to memory during a surge of Japanese Europhilia at the turn of the eighteenth century. The curious and exiguous route of its reemergence, though technically outside our period, should be traced. Much of Purchas's work was reanthologized a century later, in 1745-47, by John Green, in his four-volume New General Collection of Voyages and Travels. This compilation came to the attention of the flamboyant French priest Antoine Pr?vost d'Exil?s, who had won fame some decades earlier with Manon Lescaut Pr?vost used Green as a source for a twenty-volume anthology, Histoire g?n?rale des voyages, of 1746-61. This opus by Pr?vost was republished in the Netherlands in French and then translated into Dutch, as Historische beschrijving der reizen (Historical Description of Travels), in 1747-80, in which fourth-hand form Saris's journal returned to Japan.45 Not long after publication, a copy was in the collection of the daimyo of Fukuchiyama, Kutsuki Masatsuna, a keen Western</page><page sequence="5">54 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2005 VOLUME LXXXVII NUMBER 1 ist. Masatsuna lent the Dutch volumes to Matsura Kiyoshi (also called Seizan), a descendant of Shigenobu and Ta kanobu, and the incumbent daimyo of Hirado.46 After the English in 1623 (and later the Dutch, in 1639) had quit the small island, Hirado had slumped in wealth and power. Kiyo shi, fascinated by his wealthier ancestors' vital role in history, obtained a portrait of James I (a hand-colored copperplate), which he framed and kept beside him to remind him of the entwined Matsura and English pasts.47 But Kiyoshi could not read Dutch. He arranged for relevant sections of Saris's jour nal to be put into Japanese for him, engaging the scion of a hereditary translator family, Motoki Ry?ei. Among the ex cerpts culled was the fundamental one of the arrival of the Clove and the viewing of the Venus [and Cupid]. Ryoei did not well understand the painting's theme, so he resorted to pho netic transliteration, but he got the gist of the story. Follow ing Purchas, he transposed parts of the text into the third person. Ry?ei's rendition: "Saris permitted several women to enter his cabin, where was hanging a painting, Heeniyusukipi dou, rendered in a coarse [biro] way. A mother was cradling her child. The women fell down before it and prayed."48 Already flummoxed by the Dutch ''Venus en Kupido, " Ry?ei was utterly defeated by the laconic phrase used to denote Mary and Jesus: "O.L.V. met haaren Zoon" (Our Beloved Lady and her Son). Perhaps in deference to Kiyoshi, Ry?ei excised the fact that the blunder was made by the daimyo's own ladies. He also toned down the reference to Christianity, which by then was proscribed, and Ry?ei also added, for safety's sake, "most of [the women] would have been Bud dhists, but perhaps there were some Christians among them."49 These translations were made for Kiyoshi's private interest and were not published. As they were kept in his Edo man sion, not in distant Hirado Castle, however, they could be seen by those who came to use the daimyo's extensive library. The townsman scholar and artist Shiba K?kan wrote of read ing the Dutch Pr?vost there. He did not date the event, but it appears in his commonplace book (zuihitsu) of 1811. There are problems with K?kan's account, for he claimed to have talked to Kiyoshi directly, which is implausible given their difference in rank, and even has it that the daimyo obtained the Dutch volumes from Masatsuna for his (K?kan's) benefit, which cannot be believed. Nevertheless, K?kan noted the confusion over the subject but did not refer to the picture as Venus, either with or without Cupid, perhaps to hide his inability to untangle the title any better than Ry?ei. Further, K?kan confused the title of the book and also that of the retired daimyo and twisted other details. He seemed to be retelling an oral account and fraudulently giving out that he had read the actual book. Still, his reference reveals a con tinued interest in the encounter. K?kan's narrative began with his inquiry about the volumes, then reported Kiyoshi's supposed reply: Lord Matsura, the Marshal of Iki, addressed me and said, "Kutsuki, the Marshal of Oki, possesses the European book you wish to consult, which is Ueirerudo beshikereihingu [wereld heschrijving, "description of the world"?not the correct title]. I shall accede to your request and speak to Lord Kutsuki about it." The work was duly sent to Lord Matsura. It contained the story of the arrival of the English ship at Hirado. At that time government was under the control of Matsura H?gen [actually, H?in, or Shigenobu], though he was nominally in retirement. On one occasion he took his ladies aboard the English vessel, where many framed pictures were hung. One was a shunga [see below]. The ladies stared at it intently, and worshiped it. The English thought to themselves, "Now, Buddhism arrived in their country of Japan some while ago, so how peculiar that they should venerate shungaV'50 K?kan deleted all mention of Christianity. Shunga means what we would now call pornography.51 Pictures for India Notwithstanding Saris's "Observations," as we have seen, no paintings were sent out on the Clove, but if any were shipped in response to Saris's Plymouth list, they would have just missed the next sailing, which by bad luck departed two weeks after his return to England.52 Opportunity came the following season, in 1616, when the Clove made its return to Bantam, with the Defence, under Samuel Castleton, but they did not convey pictures nor sail as far as Japan. The Japan factory ledgers log in a large consignment of paintings, and also prints, in the summer of 1616, and it is therefore neces sary to find another sailing to account for their arrival. This will introduce the Indian context.53 As early as January 1613, the English East India Company had received from its new factory at Surat, in Gujarat, a report that wool and other cloth were good trade items but recommending for presents knives and mirrors and "a good store of pictures, espetially such as discover Venus and Cupids actes."54 Having mulled over the opinions from India, together with Saris's "Observations" relating to Japan, the company decided to act and send paintings without waiting for Saris's return. The Plymouth list and the anecdote concerning Saris's own Venus are therefore not what actually prompted the export of pictures. It was in February and March 1614, while Saris was still heading back from Japan that four ships sailed out from the Downs, near the mouth of the Thames, under the charge of Nicholas Down ton: the New Year's Gift, the Solomon, the Hector, and the Merchant's Hope.55 Twelve separate stock sailings (in which merchants put up their own stock) had been made since the foundation of the company (Saris's had been the eighth), but it had now formed a joint stock (in which merchants invested in the company, which was responsible for all the stock), allowing a one-third expansion in capacity, with four ships dispatched instead of three; this was the second such expedition. Down ton sailed via Africa to Surat, the site of the English factory and the main port of the Mogul empire. Crucially and unusually, the cargo invoices survive.56 The New Year's G?/?was the chief vessel, brand-new, 650 tons, and its invoice mentions 117 oil paintings, specifying price and (intermittently) themes, though not sizes.57 These are the works that ultimately arrived in Japan. In October, the flotilla arrived in Swally, on India's western coast. The ships sailed up the Tapu River, to Surat, where they unloaded such goods as were destined to be left there, for the Indian market, and prepared for the next leg of their voyage, to Bantam. The discharging very nearly did not hap</page><page sequence="6">THE ANGLO-JAPANESE PAINTING TRADE IN THE EARLY 1600S 55 pen, as ships under the Portuguese viceroy of the Indies attacked them in port, "seeking to interrupt the peaceable and quiet trade of the English," wrote an outraged Down ton.58 The Gift, being the biggest, was the focus of attack, and "had not the Gift let slip one cable and veered another, it would have gone hard with them." The battle raged for ten days, with eleven English killed, until the viceroy, "seeing God crossing him in all his injurious attempts," took his "saucy governed, bragging frigats" out, allowing unloading to com mence. The ships remained in Surat until the following March, 1615, when the Merchant's Hope returned to England, leaving the other three to go on to Bantam. Down ton died en route, and command passed to Thomas Elkington, who, in terestingly, records that the flotilla now had two Japanese aboard, being "persons brought out of England";59 these must be Cosmo and Christopher (prebaptismal names un known), the first Japanese to get there, who came in 1588 with the rest of the booty seized by Thomas Cavendish's Globe from the Spanish Santa Anna. Whether their local knowledge was tapped by the company and their views on war pictures and "lascivious" ones solicited prior to the voyage or during the sorting in India goes unrecorded. Of the Gift's paintings, some did remain in India, but most went on to Bantam. The initial London invoice gives two sets of works: seventy-eight, overwhelmingly portraits, predomi nantly of English sitters, including members of the royal family and court, and also two foreign monarchs, "the Tam berlaine" (the great thirteenth-century Mongol khan, Tim?r, known by that name after Christopher Marlowe's play of 1587), and "the Great Magoll" (the reigning Mogul emperor, Jah?ng?r). And, secondly, "seven cases and chests" of paint ings, to a total of thirty-nine; of this group, all have titles given, the breakdown being twenty-five classical gods, god desses, and similar; six Christian themes (New and Old Tes tament, though mostly narrative, and only one unambigu ously entitled "Our Saviour"), three generic figures; and a set of five of the five senses. There are no war paintings, but the "lascivious" ones are clear enough. There is no complete list of what was left in India, but Downton recorded making a present to the local Mogul nabob (governor) of "one picture of Mars and Venus [and] one picture Paris in judgement," and also to the nabob's emissary, "one picture of Moses."60 Precisely these figure in the Gift's invoice in the second group, where we find "1 of Maree and Venos," "1 of Moyses," "1 of Parris Judgment," priced at two to four pounds. There are few more details, although Thomas Keridge, an English merchant attached to the Surat factory, thought up to eighty paintings could be sold there, and he asked for more to be sent in the next shipment, to include "different fictions of feigned gods," but not portraits, "for they esteem not the ladies pictures according to their value"; he also asked for "some two or three hundred pictures which are cheaper," probably meaning prints.61 This may have affected what was left there. Note that already English painters were working in India, the first having arrived in 1593: James Story, sent by the London-based pretender to the Portuguese throne, Prince Antonio, "to draw the plats [make the pictures] of castles and fortesses." After briefly entering the Jesuit order, to escape incarceration by the Portuguese, he painted the church of St. Paul in Goa, then took "an house without the cloister and opened shop."62 His success was such that he "made his account to stay there while he lived," and this may have even first prompted the English East India Company to think of exporting pictures. However, other records show that some of the Gi? s portraits did remain in India, though these were a special category, claimed by Keridge himself to be "presents from our King's majesty's own hand for the Mogul and not from the merchants as heretofore."63 This royal present com prised likenesses of James I, Queen Anne, and Tamberlaine, for the English knew Jah?ng?r traced himself back to Timur. It is likely that the portrait of "the Great Magoll" was intended to be presented along with these were it not that, as Keridge noted, "the Mogoll's picture, drawn in England, is nothing like him so will serve no use at all."64 William Edwards, who presented the three acceptable items, substituted one Princess Elizabeth and wrote that Jah?ng?r "esteemed [them] much."65 The chronicle of this reign, the JaK?ngirnama, contains a reference to the Tamberlaine sent to Jah?ng?r, as "in the belief of the Franks . . . [it] was T?m?r" (all Europeans were re ferred to as Franks), though the Moguls thought he looked quite different.66 At least seven pictures were, therefore, left in India by the Gift, but before continuing with the Gift to Bantam, more information on what was deposited at Surat can be gleaned from the documents pertaining to the fifth voyage of the joint stock, which left the Downs almost exactly a year later, in the spring of 1615 (the one that left within weeks of Saris's return). The four ships this time were the large Lion and Dragon and the smaller Peppercorn and Expedition, all com manded by William Keeling. They were bound for Surat, and no further. Data are rich because this mission had a political, as well as a trade, function, since Keeling was taking an ambassador to Jah?ng?r.67 James F s legate was Sir Thomas Roe, courtier, grandson of a lord mayor of London, and friend of Ben Jonson (later also of John Donne) .68 This flotilla did not carry paintings, though it took a painter, Robert Hewes, whom Roe introduced to Jah?ng?r and who was employed at the Mogul court.69 On arrival in Surat, Roe referred to obtaining pictures "to use on occasions, and dispose as my businesse required," which must mean items from the Gift still remaining, though the ship had sailed on.70 Implied is that in India, paintings were intended only as gifts and not, as those sent on to Japan, as commodities. Roe mentioned giving Jah?ng?r seven likenesses of English wor thies, including James I and Queen Anne (though he already had a pair of these), Sir Thomas Smythe, governor of the company, and the countess of Somerset (whose husband owned some of England's most conspicuous "lascivious" paintings, as seen above).71 All the portraits mentioned by Roe figure in the Gifts cargo. Jah?ng?r hung them around his throne as part of the decorations for New Year, which was then under way.72 Jah?ng?r, no fighter or administrator, as his dynasty-building father, Akbar, had been, was well known as an aesthete, and it has been judged that "patronage of the arts remains the outstanding achievement of his reign."73 When he saw a Portrait of a Lady, by Isaac Oliver, in Roe's possession (like Saris's Venus, this was for his private use, not for presentation or sale), Jah?ng?r offered 10,000 rupees for</page><page sequence="7">55 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2005 VOLUME LXXXVII NUMBER 1  2 Rowland Bucket, The Annunciation, oil on canvas, 1608. Hertfordshire, United Kingdom, Hatfield House (photo: courtesy of The Marquess of Salisbury) it, some sixty times what Roe said he had paid in London.74 At least fourteen paintings were therefore left in India. It seems clear that the first group of paintings (mostly portraits) must have been made in England, as they show English figures, except for those fictionalized. A memoran dum prepared for the Gift's master, Martin Pring, indicates these were newly made for sending and not bought already made in London. Written by Rowland Bucket, a member of the Painter-Stainers, this is a critical piece of evidence, for it is the only name associated with the shipment.75 Bucket enjoined care "in regard that thay are newes," and he advised that if the pictures were tacky, or became so (in the tropical heat), they should be placed in the sun for drying, and, if they were stuck together, "you may wash of[f] the linte or paper with a spung and faire watter." Although forgotten today, Bucket (sometimes written Poquet) was a person of some consequence in his own time, and his career must be briefly outlined.76 He was born in London of German parents in about 1570. He is first heard of as an artist at the beginning of the new century, in Istanbul, where he had accompanied an English mission and where he is said to have painted a portrait of Elizabeth I for the sultan's mother. By 1605 he was in England and working for William Cecil, earl of Salisbury, who had patronized the well-known miniaturist Nicholas Hill iard but after taking an early version of the grand tour had succumbed to the Italianate preference. Through the English ambassador to Venice, Sir Henry Wotton, Cecil obtained a stream of good Italian paintings and determined to create a mansion in a suitable modern taste to display them, to which end he remodeled Hatfield House. The Hatfield project</page><page sequence="8">THE ANGLO-JAPANESE PAINTING TRADE IN THE EARLY 1600S 57 stunned London, and, as Henry Peachman wrote in his Art of Drawing of 1606, Cecil was engaging "excellent artistes" spe cifically of English birth in "the beautifying of his houses, especially his chappell at Hatfield." The work, ongoing as the Gift left, was completed in 1617. The chapel (including the Apostles and Prophets) is largely the work of Bucket, and as it was never remodeled again that makes him one of the visible painters of the period, albeit seen only in religious pieces; the Annunciation painted for the chapel in 1608 is now regarded as his finest work (Fig. 2). For the full suite of pictures, Bucket received unspecified "large sums." It is clear that the well-traveled Cecil regarded the similarly well-trav eled Bucket as a cut above his peers. The diarist Richard Symons thought Bucket "the only man that doth understand perspective [probably meaning simply the new Italianate style] of all the painters of London," and Bucket's entourage was flourishing, too, with his best pupil, Edward Pierce, work ing with Inigo Jones. Here was clearly the person for the East India Company to turn to for advice about?or even for production of, though Bucket himself was not cheap?fash ionable work with an international flair for sending to impor tant figures abroad. Bucket's career peaked in the next de cade when he was twice made master of the Company of Painter-Stainers (in 1626-27 and 1630-31), and deemed consequential enough to have his coat of arms "placed in the windows before the fire" in the company's hall, an honor accorded to only two others.77 Bucket is last heard of in 1639, when he was living in a house belonging to the Cecils (rented for sixteen shillings per year) near St. Martin-in-the-Fields. The Gift's invoice gives no name with the second group (including the classical themes) but refers to them as "pic tures received from Roane," which was the English name for the French city Rouen. Relevantly, on the only occasion that Roe refers to the provenance of the "business" paintings (as distinct from gifts) that he had at his disposal, he describes one of them as "a French picture but excellent woorke."78 The first group can be associated with Bucket, and if the "lascivious" paintings were made in Rouen in the winter or spring of 1614 (so as to be still wet at sailing in March), then certain clues exist as to their probable makers. Rouen was a city of over seventy thousand souls, in France second only to Paris, and though ravaged by the Wars of Religion, it had regained its commercial status as entrep?t for the French capital and interior, and for the Low Countries as well.79 Though some thirty miles inland, it could (like Surat) be reached by oceangoing ships, along the navigable Seine; Rouenese vessels regularly plied to Africa and North and South America. The city was famed for its sailcloth, a com modity that brought the English there in numbers.80 Con tacts with London were close, and much of Rouen's financing was secured not in Paris, or in Amsterdam, as one might suspect, but in London.81 Rouen's main export was cloth, not rough sailcloth but fine linen, but its secondary one was painting, though not of a particularly exalted type?to wit, of picture playing cards; England was one of its biggest mar kets.82 More substantial pictures were produced, too, though not for export, at the Jesuit College, which from 1615 was headed by Etienne B?net, a significant art theorist.83 Rouen, like anywhere else, also had town painters, though here known for their unusual coupling of indigenous northern Mannerism with an Italianate style recently introduced by Martin de Vos, a student of Tintoretto.84 If the English fol lowed up on their playing-card contacts to seek producers of higher-level works, it would have been to the town painters (not the Jesuits) that they turned. The names of few are recorded, but prominently active since the mid-sixteenth century was the Jouvenet family, No?l being their leading master in the 1610s.85 Nicolas Poussin, who was born and raised nearby, is believed to have studied in Rouen in about 1612, and it is possible he was still there in early 1614. Two generations later, the Parisian master Jean Jouvenet allowed it to be thought that No?l, his grandfather, had actually taught Poussin, though as Jean was himself a pupil of Poussin, he may have been trying to establish some specious priority over the acknowledged star of French painting.86 No work by No?l Jouvenet survives, nor any by Poussin from this juvenile period.87 However, whatever the specifics, Rouen was cele brated for its artistic diversity and freedom, and was not a bad place for the English, given their established trade links, to look for paintings.88 The Gift, Hector, and Solomon arrived in Bantam during May and June 1615. There they met the Thomas and Advice, also company vessels, under captains Richard Rowe and John Totten, which had left England some two months after, with the third and fourth joint stock expeditions, but arrived before, not going via India. Rowe (not to be confused with Roe) had brought a letter from Smythe to the effect that any items from the Gift or the other vessels deemed useful for Japan should be transshipped; the Thomas and Advice were bound there, whereas the earlier three would not go beyond Bantam. A company representative, Robert Youart, wrote back to Smythe that he and Elkington "well perused" these instructions and "presently proceeded according to your or der."89 Among items moved across would have been the remaining London and Rouenese paintings. The Hector was now abandoned as rotten; the Solomon and Gift departed again for England, just before Christmas, and were back at the Downs the next summer. The Thomas and Advice arrived in Japan in June and July 1616, respectively. Since the Hirado factory accounts list the paintings as coming in June, it was the Thomas that carried them. Paintings for England Before continuing with these pictures exported to Japan, the Japanese pictures that traveled to London with Saris in the Clove should be considered. There were three sets: commod ity pieces for sale, gifts, and some items that Saris had ac quired for himself. Saris not only carried a "lascivious" work with him for the outbound voyage, but he also took some home, and, as these are the first Japanese images ever re corded in England?for even before the commodity paint ings were put on sale or the gifts distributed, Saris's own purchases were displayed?their story needs to be told. Saris passed his personal imports about in London's main business center, the Royal Exchange, and when not doing so, he stored them in the company's offices in Philpot Lane, which were, in fact, two rooms at the back of Smythe's family house.90 When this little trove was discovered, the company felt obliged to act. Court minutes for January 1615 bristle at "imputations and aspertions beeinge cast upon Captoe Saris</page><page sequence="9">58 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2005 VOLUME LXXXVII NUMBER 1  3 Kano School?, erotic scenes, handscroll, ink, color, gold, and silver on paper, ca. 1600. London, The British Museum for certaine lasciuious bookes and pictures brought home by him and diuulged," the result of which was "a greate scandal unto this Companye and unbeseeminge their grauitie to permitt." Smythe announced he "purposed to gett them out of his [Saris's] haunds, yf possiblie he could, to be burnt or otherwise disposed of ... or else to free his house of them and of him both."91 Saris had not seen his earlier indictments dropped to destroy his career now, so he turned the collec tion over. Smythe "brought them forth that such as haue heard derogatorye speeches used vpon the Exchange and elsewhere should now likewise be eye witness of the consum inge of them in the fire," which "would give satisfacci?n to any honestlie affected." Thereupon the "wicked spectacles" were pitched in and "contynued till they were burnt and turnd into smoke."92 This is a pity, as little Japanese erotica, or shunga, from so early a period survives. Most extant items are painted handscrolls, though it is unclear whether the term "books" used here would cover that format (Fig. 3). The earliest printed shunga appears only some seventy years later, and bound volumes concomitantly with them.93 It may be wondered how the Court reconciled this destruction with its recently sent "lascivious" paintings, for the same term is used of both sets of images, but a firm line was no doubt placed between nude gods and goddesses, however friskily cavorting, and copulation. Saris, back in the fold, was praised for his work and given a gratuity of 500 marks.94 News of his ultimately good recep tion arrived in Japan the following year, and the chief factor, Richard Cocks, wrote to a colleague, "Generall Sares is ar rived in England and most esteemed of"; the Hirado contin gent expected him back the next season "with the best fleete of ships that ever came to the Indies."95 But Saris never sailed east again. He married and moved to the plush village of Fulham, where he died in 1643, leaving a sizable estate.96 His grave can still be seen in the parish church.97 Saris did not record how he came by his Japanese erotica, for these works were bought with private funds, and it was not necessary (or advisable) to record them. He gave more infor mation on the works purchased as commodities with com pany assets. In September 1613 he found himself at Uraga, near Edo, and there bought eight Japanese paintings from a Spanish merchant whom he had met on William Adams's introduction.98 Saris did not give the names of artists or ateliers, nor prices or subjects, but he identified the works as "skrenes" (screens). This was a standard format, some five and a half feet high by twice as long, made with either six or eight hinged leaves, to stand directly on the floor, in a zigzag manner, known in Japanese as byobu. Such screens came in left and right pairs, so Saris either bought eight pairs (sixteen units) or four pairs (eight units), probably the latter, since throughout the records the English refer to a pair of byobu as two paintings, though the Japanese would consider them one. Saris noted that the screens came from Miyako (modern Kyoto),99 a city famous for its quality of craftsmanship, far beyond the capabilities of the garrisonlike shogunal capital. The first sale of goods from the Clove took place in London in December 1614. It was of applied art objects, outside the purview of this paper, but which may in passing be noted as mostly lacquer ("varnish"); the best pieces went for as much as nineteen pounds, though most fetched around five pounds.100 Ceramics were not imported, though porcelain later became a staple of East-West trade. A screen sale was held the following March, and although Saris referred to only the one purchase, a dozen items (likely six pairs) now went under the candle (precursor of the hammer). The auction record states: Lot 1, "A biobee or skeene guilded and painted with some resemblances of warfare." Sold for ?6 2, "Another biobee . . . portrayede full of horses."

Subjects are given: warfare is the most common, with four units; next comes hunting, with three; then horses and fowl, with two each. The subject of the last screen is unstated but must be the pair to one of the (otherwise odd-numbered) hunting scenes. Left and right elements were sold separately. Only merchants who had bought the freedom of the com pany (that is, those who had contributed to its stock) were permitted to bid at sales. Although all purchasers' names are given, these do not therefore necessarily indicate the final buyers, nor can all the names of purchasers be traced: the first three lots went to Smythe himself; lots 4 through 8 went respectively to Abraham Chamberlain (an East India com modity broker), Robert Bell (a founder-member of the En glish East India Company), Mr. Ward (unknown), Ralph Hamor (a founder of the company), and Hugh Hamersley (a member of the Court from 1601). Robert Johnson (un known) was narrowly edged out by Bell for lot 5 but obtained instead lot 9; lots 10 through 12 went to William Palmer (a "French m'chant"?perhaps involved with the Rouen trade), Edward Plummer, and Thomas Plummer (unknown, perhaps brothers).103 The screens were evidently treated seriously, for they fetched the same sum as a moderately good European painting, though none was as highly valued as the best articles of "varnish" (which were large trunks).</page><page sequence="11">50 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2005 VOLUME LXXXVII NUMBER 1 6 Tethered Horses, six-fold screen (left of pair), ink and color on paper, monochrome print, ink on paper, early 17th century. London, The British Museum The third group of items was part of an important gift exchange between the English and Japanese rulers. Saris had gone to Edo in September for a formal audience with the shogun, Tokugawa Hidetada, Ieyasu's son, to tender James I's letter of accreditation. He presented the shogun not with paintings, as he would the Mogul ruler, but with a sumptuous Turkish carpet. He then went to Ieyasu's castle at Sunpu, two days' march from Edo, where he proffered a gilt-silver "pro spective glass" (telescope) and other objects, but no paint ings.104 Shogun and ex-shogun were obliged by protocol to make reciprocal gifts, and Hidetada presented two suits of armor (which survive) and some swords (inextant) (Fig. 7). Parade hardware was always laid by for giving, as it was the norm of interwarrior exchange. As Ieyasu was retired and no longer in military training, he gave James cultural pieces? paintings. He did not have examples of the requisite quality with him, so he instructed Saris to collect the gift, five pairs of screens, in Miyako, which the English entourage would have to pass on their way back to Hirado.105 Miyako screens again outclass Edo ones. The Tokugawa did not yet control Miyako, for it was still held by the Toyotomi. Many of Miyako's best artists were (or had to be) aligned with that faction, and it is unlikely they would (or could) respond to a Tokugawa call. Yet surely Ieyasu would have applied to celebrated artists of the kind whose names survive and whose work can be iden tified. The biggest Miyako atelier was run by the Kano school. After the Tokugawa destroyed the Toyotomi in 1615, part of this school would relocate to Edo and come into shogunal employ. The great master Kano Mitsunobu had died in 1608, but his adoptive brother, Mitsuyori, was active, although he is known to have been a particular Toyotomi loyalist; on their eradication he took the tonsure and adopted the recluse's name Sanraku, by which he is generally known today. "San raku" did work for Hidetada in 1619, but he probably would not have embraced a Tokugawa commission in 1613. Other probables are the host of Kano-trained independents, though of the two most admired, Hasegawa T?haku had died about 1610 and Kaih? Y?sh? was almost eighty.106 The shogunal annals contain references to Ieyasu's gift. It is confirmed that there were five pairs of screens, said to be of the proper ceremonial type, on gold grounds.107 Artists and themes are not stated. It was about eight days' steady march from Sunpu to Miyako. Either a posthaste messenger was sent to expedite Ieyasu's commission, or paintings already in production, but destined elsewhere, were appropriated. When Saris arrived on October 16, the screens were not ready. He spent his free time viewing famous spots around the city, such as the Roman Catholic church (nanbanji, soon to be demolished) and the Great Buddha Hall (daibutsuden, which he calculated to be as "long as the Westerne end of Saint Pauls in London"? meaning the medieval cathedral, destroyed in 1666). Finally, the screens appeared, "delivered to me out of the Castle, being ten Beobs, or large pictures to hang a chamber with."108 The pairs are counted as ten separate items. Delivery was from Nij? Castle, the city's shogunal stronghold.109 A message came through that Ieyasu desired ninety-nine bar rels of gunpowder in return: assault on the Toyotomi was looming, and it may have been a subterfuge that he, not Hidetada, placed this devastating order. A company em ployee, Richard Wickham, somberly wrote from Edo at this time, "warr or Revolution is stirring the Empire."110 When it broke out, Saris was gone. On return to Hirado, Saris had about one month to pre pare for sailing home. On November 10-11 he recorded, "the Emperor's [ex-shogun's111] present to the King of En gland was laden aboard, being 10 beobes or pictures after the countrye fashion."112 The commodity screens would have been laden, too, and Saris's own objects secreted aboard. The Clove then sailed to Bantam; by summer 1614, it was at the Cape of Good Hope, where Saris wrote to Ralph Coppindale, designated to lead the second voyage to Japan and then at sea with the third expedition of the Joint Stock, informing him that his "Japan wares," including "items of most excellent</page><page sequence="12">THE ANGLO-JAPANESE PAINTING TRADE IN THE EARLY 1 600S ?\ varnish" and "beoubes," were intact and "for 100 or 2000 railles cannot be amiss att returne": that is, he was expecting over ?666.11S At Bantam, Coppindale transshipped to the Hoziander and led its rabble of a crew ("truly I never saw a more froward and bad leawd company than most of them are," wrote Cocks) to Hirado for the next mission, but as we have seen, he did not take paintings, nor buy any to take home.114 Once the Clove's goods had arrived in London, the military gifts were sent to the Royal Armouries in the Tower, for the admiration of posterity (though they were soon mislabeled as Mogul, under which error they languished until the late twentieth century). But fault was found with Ieyasu's screens. An aesthetic somersault occurred. In December, before the screen sale, the Court declared that "the skrenes w'ch are sent unto His Ma'tie from Japan (beinge h?lfe a score in number) are not soe good as some of those w'ch the Com pany have," meaning Saris's tentative purchases from the Spaniard outshone Ieyasu's superlative pieces.115 A process of swapping thereupon took place: the company wished that "nott above 2 or 3 should bee presented to His Ma'tie" from Ieyasu's sets, and they substituted "some of the best of the Companie's in stead of them." It was Smythe who divided the groups. Assuming all references are to units, not pairs, a total of eighteen paintings came to London. As we know twelve were auctioned, just six made their way to the king, though Ieyasu had sent him ten. There is no further documentation of these, and none survives in the English royal collection; they were surely lost in the fire of Whitehall Palace (the Banqueting House, with its Rubens ceiling, alone surviving) in 1698. The mixing of the two sets may account for the wide disparity of prices at auction, with eight units fetching four to six pounds and four twice that, or eight to ten pounds. Theme may also have been relevant, however, for across the board hunting screens yielded most, warfare second, and natural history a distant third?a hierarchy not unexpected in England of the period. Saris says no more about buying paintings in Japan, and the Court documents are silent about importations. Cocks's diary offers further evidence of screen purchasing by the company, although it seems that in the end nothing was sent to En gland. Unfortunately, Cock's journal is not integrally pre served, beginning only in June 1615 (with destruction of the Toyotomi castle in Osaka, Cocks appalled at how 120,000 people "should be so soone overthrowne"); this is six months after Saris's departure, and so no information on the Clove's exports can be expected. But Cocks referred to other works. He noted that a pair of screens was given him by the governor of Nagasaki, Hasegawa Gonrokur? (and that the same official gave Cocks's opposite number in the VOC a pair).116 Other screens came into the factory's possession somehow, and, intriguingly, Cocks loaned them out, to people requiring a visual splash but lacking their own fine imagery. In early 1616, for example, Cocks lent a "paire of bubes" to the daimyo of Karatsu, Terazawa Hidetaka, traveling without screens on a visit to Hirado to congratulate Takanobu on a shogunal gift that doubled his stipend.117 On another occa sion, the daimyo of Omura, Omura Suminori, passed through Hirado and was required to feast Takanobu, so he sent "to borrow bubes" from the English. Cocks confessed 7 Iwai Yozaemon, armor, lacquered iron and leather, silk and gilt bronze, ca. 1612. Leeds, Royal Armouries Museum himself a little mystified by this "singular uuse they have in Japon (nifon katange)," that is to say, by the singularities of Japanese banquets (nihon katade), which could not take place without screens.118 These screens were probably still in Hirado at the factory's closure and formed part of the goods dismissed at the final stocktaking as "trash and lumber"; the company, "exceedinglie pestered therew'th," severely up braided Cocks for buying goods that did not sell and then failing to send them to London.119 In Japan No cargo invoice survives for the Thomas's passage between Bantam, where it took on cargo from the Gift (and possibly from the Hector and the Solomon), including many paintings, and Nagasaki, but assessments can be made from the Hirado factory accounts. These are fully preserved, although they were never properly kept. When the English quit Japan, Cocks's documentation was so muddled that the company professed it "never saw greater confusion," referring to his ledgers (just two books filled in a decade) as "2 waste books . . . confusedlie entred." Cocks would have been prosecuted for dereliction had he not died at sea.

London, The Worshipful Society of Apothecaries of London over the "debaust carriage . . . and the evill seruices" of Richard.120 Thus, the documentation relating to paintings and prints arriving in Japan quite literally fails to give the whole picture. Many military themes are apparent in the muddled ac counts. None such was on the New Year's Gift, and, indeed, William Edwards had written to London when the ships arrived in Surat, that this was regrettable and some should be sent.121 It must be that either the Thomas or the Advice, probably the former, bore another batch of pictures. After Saris's return, the Court had mulled over his suggestions. It was on Valentine's Day 1615 that Saris first bearded the company in Philpot Lane. The Court minutes discuss export matters and dwell on "pictures of warres," but make no comment about "lascivious" pieces.122 True, this was after the Thomas and Advice had left England, but it shows that the company preferred to send these themes rather than "lasciv ious" ones. Perhaps recognizing the lack of military images in the Gifts cargo as an unfortunate omission, they sent some on the Thomas and the Advice and planned to send some more. These, however, if sent, never got as far as Japan. The Hirado accounts, following the arrival of the Thomas, have just one entry for a land battle, referred to as "1 fight," costing 2 taels 4 mas.123 Presumptive resale value in Japan is generally given, but only rarely the purchase price in Lon don, so the profit cannot be calculated. Since the cheapest painting for which evidence has been adduced here is about two pounds, this fight, at about twelve shillings, may be a print, though paintings priced under a pound did exist. On the other hand, a good print would not sell in London for above a shilling or two.124 This picture therefore might be a very poor painting or an extremely good print, or the price might represent a severe markdown of an original painting to make it salable in Japan. Naval engagements are in greater abundance. The Neth erlandish tradition of seascape art was influential in England, which made procurement easier. The company may also have hoped to emphasize English maritime strength, possibly at the expense of the Dutch, which was a habit with them: in 1625, they were officially reprimanded by Charles I for com missioning insolent paintings of VOC waterborne uncouth ness.125 A third rationale may have been to offer instruction in an area of shogunal weakness, for the Tokugawa were proficient in war by land but scantly informed about naval engagements. The accounts give three pictures listed as "seafights in a'o 88," one for 2 taels 6 mas, one for just 12 mas, another even cheaper at 4 mas. The subject is the Spanish Armada of anno 1588. The third is surely a print. Similar in orientation is a depiction of the Ark Royal, the greatest vessel of its age (called the "odd [most unique] ship in the world," by its commander), bought from Sir Walter Raleigh in 1587 for five thousand pounds and used the following year as the flagship against the Spanish fleet. The Ark was decommis sioned in 1606, renamed the Ann Royal, and sent to Asia, from where it was used to take Cocks home. On his death, it was diverted and stayed near India, seeing battle against the Portuguese.126 This picture cost just 4 mas. Imagery of the armada was once extremely abundant, and prints and paint ings continued to be made well into the seventeenth century, not only by England but also by other Protestant countries, though few survive (Figs. 8, 9). A contemporary English print of the Ark Royal exists (Fig. 10). A fifth image is of "the English and Spanish flee te," probably also showing the ar mada, with no price given.127 Another topic in this vein is a "Cales Voyage," valued at 6 taels, the same theme as the later "4 Cadiz voyages," given with the price of three pounds;128 Cadiz (Cales to the English) was pounded from the sea by the earl of Essex and Lord Thomas Howard in 1596, which provoked the action of the armada.129 Six months later, there is suddenly an entry for "1 sea fight in a'o 88," at 2 taels 4 mas; this is either a repeat of the 2 tael 6 mas work incorrectly written or the same marked down further after failing to sell.130 The absence of other reentries suggests the pictures had found their market.</page><page sequence="14">THE ANGLO-JAPANESE PAINTING TRADE IN THE EARLY 1600S 53 9 W. H. E., The Spanish Armada, Flemish school, gouache on vellum, ca. 1605. London, Rafael Vails Limited That autumn, Wickham wrote to the merchant John Jour dain in Bantam that "a great store of English commodities" had been received, "amongst the rest . . . pictures (the most part bawdy)."131 Jourdain had met Saris when the Clove docked in Bantam on its way home.132 Saris had "much stormed" at a perceived lack of respect accorded him there, which had necessitated Jourdain 's paying him a courtesy visit aboard, where, received in the roundhouse, he surely saw the Venus, and perhaps heard the story of its reception and that Saris intended to recommend such works for export. More important, beyond these military images, Wickham's comment shows that it was the "lascivious" paintings that most aroused the interest of the English factors and were the most numerous.133 The number of these "lascivious" pieces to arrive in Japan cannot be any more accurately reported than for the military works. But they do appear in some abundance. There is a Venus and Adonis, specified as a painting "in oil," valued at 2 taels 10 mas, a Venus Sleeping with Two Satyrs, valued similarly, a Venus and Cupid at 2 taels, a Venus, Bacchus and Ceres, "very lifelike," at 3 taels, An Offering to Venus "in oil," unpriced, a Venus and Mars, at 2 taels 10 mas, and a Goddess Diana, ditto, making seven paintings.134 These are close to the Gift's com plement in subject, though none is identical; the discrepancy is probably owing to the factors assigning their own titles and/or carelessly copying from the cargo invoice. The Gift's bill, however, includes depictions of Venus, Bacchus, Ceres, Mars, and Diana, though somewhat differently entitled in specifics; it also records those of Callisto, Paris, Vulcan, the Muses, Susanna, Acteon, Adam and Eve, and Hector,135 which are not listed in Japan; of course, the Hirado accounts are incomplete. The accounts for one month later reenter only two "lasciv ious" works: Venus and Cupid (now specified "in oyle") and Venus, Bacchus and Ceres.136 Three months later, in December, there is an entry for a new work, whose sudden appearance emphasizes the incompleteness of the records. It is also a Venus and Cupid, said to be in oil, worth 6 taels, the highest price yet, though still only ?1 10/-.137 Beyond warfare and "lascivious" pictures were several themes not specifically recommended by Saris, and in fact they compose the majority. Twenty-five landscapes are re corded: six at 3 taels 6 mas; three at 6 taels 6 mas; and three 10 The Ark Royal, monochrome print, ink on paper, ca. 1600.

London, The British Museum more, "one framed," at the same; plus a further thirteen "on frames." This last group, entered with purchase cost in Lon don as well as expected value in Japan, for the first time allows a computation of estimated profit. The works were rudimentary enough to cost just 11 shillings each to buy and were priced in Japan at 2 taels 9 mas 6 candereen, or about 15 shillings, denoting a markup of 30 percent, which was meager.138 Several pictures giving views of London are listed, some identified as "with Aldermen," some without, prices ranging from 1 to 5 taels. How these would have looked is uncertain, for there are only three pre-Civil War paintings of London in existence, the earliest dated to 1630. The famous printed view by Claes Visscher, taken from Southwark, may be close; it was not published until 1616, but although regarded as a water shed, it may have had antecedents (Fig. II).139 Another, fourth, theme was depictions of the king in Parliament, of which there were five, ranging in price from 4 to 8 mas. This was a topical subject since the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, when Guy Fawkes tried to blow up the Houses of Parliament with James and his nobles in them. No painting of this is known today, but a print entitled James I in Parliament by the impor tant engraver Renold Elstrak survives, though it predates the plot (Fig. 12).140 Keridge had written from India, after the arrival of the Gift, that the next shipment should bring for Jah?ng?r "some courtlike pictures, as the runing at tilt, the king and nobility spectators; the king in parliament, and suchlike."141 The Court had seen ahead and already dis patched them. Since Fawkes was Catholic, the first event was interpreted as popish. These images may have been sent to Japan in an attempt to point out that in England Catholics were viewed as dangerous, and that Anglicans considered themselves different from them. Anti-Catholicism was already a powerful force in Japan, and it was crucial for the English (and the Dutch) to distance themselves from Rome. Armada pictures would have had a similar effect, and the two Japanese converts Cosmo and Christopher, having disembarked from Cavendish's ship in Plymouth just eight weeks after the defeat of the Armada, were well situated to relate how England had been saved from the Catholics at that battle by a kamikaze (divine wind).142 It is noteworthy that with the same ship ment Cocks received a book on the history of England, "from Brutt until the Gunpowder Treason," to assist in his debates with Japanese people in authority.143 Cocks went out of his way to draw on the Gunpowder Plot; he warned the secretary to one of the chief ministers that "it were good he advised the emperor [shogun] to take heed of them [Catholics], lest they did not serve him as they had donne the Kinges of England, in going about to kill and poison them or blow them up with gunpowder. . . ."144 In imagery of the king and aristocracy mercifully saved from papist murder, the English had a per fect theme to allay Japanese suspicions, just as armada imag ery showed them as not merely passive in their own defense. The idea of England as powerful and, more particularly, well-governed and stable was furthered by the export of royal images. The Stuart portraits had been left in India, but the Thomas contained a large number of their family trees (priced at 10 to 17 mas), of their arms (5 mas each), and twenty-seven "'picktures of all the kinges ct' iii shistes," that is, triple-sheet depictions of the entire court, probably showing the lords and Stuart family gathered in Whitehall. These last were bought in London at nearly 2 shillings each and were valued in Japan at just under 3 taels, which is either an astonishing expectation of a 700 percent profit or a book keeping error. Such themes would have allowed the English to claim superiority over the Dutch, for they were at pains to point out that "the king of England had vassals much greater than the prince (or country) which governed the Holland</page><page sequence="16">THE ANGLO-JAPANESE PAINTING TRADE IN THE EARLY 1600S 55 mM^ .mj'% j! ?&amp; ':M.x?.

London, The British Museum ers," whose polity, they said, subservient to Spain, was not a proper nation at all.145 On the arrival of the Thomas (before the Advice vms in), Cocks gave Matsura Takanobu a tree of the "monarky Brittan," a genealogy of "all kings from Brute" (which may have been a version of Giles Godet's often re drawn print of 1562),146 and "1 map [perhaps meaning no more than a seating layout], king in parliament"?politically loaded presents. Courtly and armorial paintings were treated with great care, and it is relevant that the guild of Painter Stainers was embroiled at this moment in a legal dispute with the College of Heralds over production, the latter complain ing that the "foule abuses and wrongs" of illegitimate pro duction was "daily perpetrated." The case was not resolved until 1621, when it was determined that eight nonherald Painter-Stainers could be nominated to make coats of 147 arms. Beyond the above was a series of one-off works and sets: four comprising the four seasons, at 2 taels 6 mas 3 can dereen together, and a group of five of the five senses, at 7 taels. Senses and seasons are not uncommon in northern European prints and paintings, sometimes rendered anthro pomorphically (Fig. 13). Moreover, the Gift had carried "5 picktures of the 5 Senses," valued at 6 pounds, although the Hirado set are less than half that price, perhaps marked down. Another item in the Hirado ledger is a Planet Venus, at 3 taels, which appears in a later entry as a set of all the planets, which would mean five (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupi ter, and Saturn), perhaps anthropomorphic. More obscure are four "of the 3 elements," at 5 taels 6 mas, perhaps showing three out of earth, air, water, and fire, perhaps also anthro pomorphically. A similar set had gone to India, for although not listed in the Gifts invoice, Roe recorded finding there "fower pickturs of the fower eliments," which he gave to Jah?ng?r; thus at least two sets had left England.148 Finally, there were two exceptional items. One is a portrait, "S'r Thomas Smith in oyle." This was no doubt similar to the Sir Thomas ?f Sonns from the Gift that Jah?ng?r had received. It is the only portrait of a named person recorded in Japan. The Hirado accounts list it as costing ?8 10/- in London; the Gifts invoice gives its portrait of Smythe and sons at ?12; perhaps the inclusion of extra figures raised the value. Though Jah?ng?r liked his version enough to display it at New Year, in Japan, disastrously, the portrait's value is given at just 12 taels, indicating this flight of vanity on the part of Smythe was repeated once too often and would have to be dumped there at about one-third its worth. The second exceptional item is a Conversion of Saint Paul, entered in the Hirado accounts at no less than 60 taels, that is, ?15, making it easily the most precious painting taken and the only one to significantly overshoot Saris's suggested price</page><page sequence="17">56 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2005 VOLUME LXXXVII NUMBER 1 13 Winter, from the series Four Seasons, monochrome print, ink on paper, 1623-32. London, The British Museum range.149 A uCondision of Paule" was on the Gift, but as it was valued at ?7 16/-, it was undoubtedly a more modest variant, akin to the two-tier representations of Smythe. These anom alous devotional works may have been intended as references to the patron saint of London or, indeed, of Goa. In India they would cause no problem, for Jah?ng?r took an interest in Christian imagery, even commissioning it for himself, and he actually owned a Saint Paul (not specified as his conversion, though Paul was rarely shown any other way), which he received later, however, so it had not come from the Gift.150 But in Japan these subjects were imprudent. Christian pieces were likely to undo the goodwill engendered by other imag ery. The possible look of such works can only be guessed at, although Bucket's painting (Fig. 2) is surely close?if indeed these Saint Pauls were not by him. Among Conversions of Saint Paul, Caravaggio's epoch-making representation of 1601 was widely influential, although Carravagism did not arrive in London until some time later. Paintings Sold and Not Sold Back in Philpot Lane, the English East India Company waited for news of Japanese reaction before sending anything more besides the three groups on the Gift and another batch on the Thomas (and the military ones sent as a result of the Valen tine's Day meeting, which, however, did not go on to Japan). The minutes of the Court for September 1615 note, "For pictures, they resolvd to send none this yeare untill they may receyve intelligence from thence of what esteeme those are w'ch have bene already sent."151 In 1617, Roe dispatched information back to London in the form of a missive entitled "Advice from Sir Thomas Row of Goddes for Presents for Surratt," specifying as appropriate for presents (not as commodities) jewels, fine cloth, weapons, and "pictuers of all sortes, if good, in constant request, some of large storie." Narratives had the upper hand over portraits, despite the more or less even split of the Gifts cargo. Roe went on, "Diana this yere gave great content."152 The Gift had evidently taken at least two pictures on the theme of Diana, this one and one recorded as arriving in Japan. However, Roe warned that works should be of high quality (which most of these were not), for the Moguls had many "rich pictures coming out of Italy ouer land."153 Shortly before this advice reached London, word had come from Japan of reactions to the pictures there. Some had sold, as we have seen, but on the whole, reactions were not good, and for several reasons. The paintings would have been rigid wooden panels and framed canvases, which did not conform to the collapsible screens or rollable scrolls of Japanese ex pectation. Worse would have been the recondite nature of some of the subjects. The Moguls may have, as Roe held, liked "large storie," but in Japan, where international ex changes were less intensive, elaborate themes made no sense at all. On January 14, 1617, after six months of engagement with the paintings, and despite lack of reentries in the accounts, indicating that sales had been made, Cocks wrote to London, "no man ofreth to buy them." He did not intend to give up, however, and continued, "what they will doe hearafter I know not."154 Two weeks later, on January 27, he confirmed that the subjects were the cause of the problem, and referred to pictures of the planets, that is, the set that included the Planet Venus, though not previously mentioned as a set. Planets, whether shown anthropomorphically or as heavenly bodies, had no place in the Japanese pictorial realm, other than in the occasional esoteric Buddhist m?ndala. The one excep tion would be the depiction of a full moon (if considered as a relative to a planet), which can be found not infrequently in Japanese painting, often as an autumnal motif. It is relevant, then, that a European painting known as Full Moon unequiv ocally has been in Japan for centuries (Fig. 14). Although devoid of much surrounding data, it is without doubt a seventeenth-century European oil on canvas.155 There is no English record of a 'Full Moon, " but if it was among the set of planets done as such, not anthropomorphically, it would be ironic that the one painting left today should be from the group Cocks thought particularly unmarketable. A more than casual inspection of this painting reveals that it is not the full moon at all, though called such in Japan, purely so as to make it displayable: it shows the planet Jupiter. Regrettably, the painting is now untraceable, but it is surely the sole sur vivor of the English shipment. No such renditions of the plan ets exist in England until after the Civil War, toward the end of the seventeenth century.156 Cocks wrote that "the picktures of the plannettes &amp; other of hie price w'ch came in these shipps and cost 3/?st'r' (?3 sterling) per peece each . . . would never have sould heare for a quarter part of the money they cost in England."157 Three pounds would place the Planets at</page><page sequence="18">THE ANGLO-JAPANESE PAINTING TRADE IN THE EARLY 1600S 57 the lower end of Saris's suggestions and well below the mid dle range of those taken on the Gift. Cocks advised that "it is noe sending such matters to these partes, for they esteem a painted sheet of paper w'th a horse, shipp or a burd more then they doe such a rich pickture." And he added, starkly, "nether will anyone geve 6d [pence] for that fayre pickture of the Convertion of St Paule." A Conversion of Saint Paul would include the horse from which he fell, and ship pictures had also been taken out and put up for sale in Japan (the armada imagery). But Cocks's claim was generally valid. It should have prompted commissioning of paintings on topics (such as animals and birds) and in materials (paper) that the Japanese market could support. Cocks's words did not have that effect. Apart from Saris's reported reception of his Venus, none of the English records gives details of Japanese reactions to the imports. It would be dangerous to draw analogies between Japan and India, but it is instructive to recount Roe's one extended comment on Jah?ng?r's views?not Jah?ng?r's stated opinion but Roe's inference of them. After landing, Roe traveled some 500 miles to Ajmir, where he encountered Jah?ng?r in a hunting lodge (the court was mobile at this time). Roe's original manuscript is lost for this section, which is February 1617, so we must rely (for all his faults) on Purchas, who anthologized Roe as well as Saris (and, indeed, Cocks, and much else). Roe's stock of gifts had been im pounded by Prince Khurram (later Shah Jehan), Jah?ngTr's son, "to fulfil his base and greedy desire"; the principal item seized was a velvet-upholstered four-horse carriage, under the care of William Hemsell, coachman to the bishop of Coven try, who traveled with Roe in order to drive it, but also seized were the paintings.158 Jah?ng?r told Roe, "be not sadd; hee shall not touch nor open a seale or lock."159 A few days later, Roe and the embassy chaplain, Edward Terry, of Christchurch, Oxford, were received in audience, and Jah?ng?r, who had not only opened the locks but also rooted through the gifts, showed some pieces to them, soliciting explanations.160 He dismissed as "very meane and ordinary" two glass chests, but when it came to the paintings, Roe states, producing three, he "required my judgements of them." Two were portraits of women, surely the "two countesses" (eigh teen pounds the pair) taken out on the Gift; elsewhere, Roe refers to having paintings of Lady Montague and Lady Moly neux, which must be the same.161 The third was Venus and a Satyr?a typical "lascivious" work?which apparently Roe had not seen before, as it had never been unpacked. Jah?ng?r "commanded my interpreter not to tell me what he said, but asked his lords what they conceived should be the interpre tations or morall. ..." The courtiers offered their specula tions before Jah?ng?r asked Roe for the European analysis of what a naked woman with a half-man, half-goat might mean. Roe evaded the question, claiming it was just "an invention of the painter to shew his arte, which was poeticall." Terry equivocated similarly, replying "hee knew not." Jah?ng?r asked why they had brought a painting whose interpretation they themselves did not understand, and Roe ventured his notion of Jah?ng?r's own private reading: "I suppose he un derstood the morall to be a scorne of Asiatiques, whom the naked satyre represented, and was of the same complexion, 14 Full Moon, oil on canvas, possibly 1614. Location unknown and not unlike." The satyr was being held by Venus, "a white women, by the nose, it seemed that shee led him captive." Whether this racial interpretation was remotely on Jah?nglr's mind or not, Roe was relieved that the emperor seemed to enjoy the work anyway, and likewise the count esses, and "revealed no discontent." Jah?ng?r even took all three into his collection, as well as another group of repre sentational items, carvings of animals, which Roe, however, thought "very ridiculous and ill shaped creatures, the varnish off, and no beauty other then lumpe of wood." After the interview, Roe wrote to the company to be more careful with pictures on difficult themes, as "what they send may be subject to ill interpretation; for in that point the king and people are very pregnant and scrupulous, full of jealiousie and trickes."162 Thereafter, the company limited itself to military themes. Later, however, the Dutch merchant Francisco Pelsaert was to sum up his seven years' experiences at the Mogul court in a letter advising the VOC authorities that the best way to make up ground lost to the English was by sending "nude figures" and also, to cover all bases, "two or three good battle-pictures, painted by an artist with a pleasing style."163 In Japan, for whatever reasons, the conclusion was soon reached that many of the paintings could not be disposed of.</page><page sequence="19">58 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2005 VOLUME LXXXVII NUMBER 1 William Eaton, an employee (whose son by a Hirado woman was to be the first Japanese to study at Cambridge Univer sity),164 wrote to Smythe, "you have sent us in this cargason of goodes divers commodyties that will never sell in Japon, as . . . pictures, cunnie [rabbit] skins, galleypottes, tabel bookes [bound prints], looking glasses, speaticles."165 George Ball, company representative in Bantam and the top Englishman in Asia, wrote to London the following year in a wider analysis of reasons for the poor performance of the Hirado factory, "albeit wee approove no great benefitt by any retornes made there, yet are wee of the opinyon that were it supplyed as it should be . . . yt would prouve none of the worst fatoryes." Ball felt English-made goods should be aban doned in favor of Asian items, the English becoming middle men. He singled out as the kind of "trumpery" they should stop sending from London "gallypottes, pictures, looking glasses, table bookes, threed and spectacles," and Ball summed up that these items merely "lye by the walls untill they consume to nothing more then disgrace to the ware house, discredditt to the factors, and disanymating to their negotiations."166 Ball knew a bit about making money, for he was later recalled to London on the charge of private trading to the tune of seventy thousand pounds.167 A further problem emerged, as Eaton informed London. Bucket's instructions had not been followed. The result: the pictures "weare all spoyled by putting them face to face w'thout oyle papers betwene them, that wen wee came to open them they weare all spoyled."168 Edwards had already written from India on this subject, that "pictures of all sorts are much requested for presents . . . but those on boards will be defaced by the heat of the weather, as these now sent, in warping and splitting."169 The paintings deemed presentable were given in India, and those not so, it appears, were taken on to Japan, for sale, marked down if necessary; they could also have been damaged in this second leg. Cocks also re ferred to the damage: the pictures were "wropped together face to face &amp;, as it seemeth, were not drie. Soe that in openyn of them one spoil'd another. . . ."17? They were "not all of them together worth a peny, being utterly defaced." This so annoyed Cocks (who rightly reckoned he would be held at fault if the factory failed to turn a healthy profit) that he could not stop harping on it. He grumpily proposed that "yf your Wor[ship]s send such thinges for these partes it were necessary to have a man to keep them cleane &amp; put them in order, 8c then would they be vendable."171 Four days earlier he had already written to London that the works "came so torne, broaken 8c defaced that they are not worth anything, and the pictures in oyle (to the life) were clapt wet togeather, that in openying of them all are defaced 8c noe remedy to amend it."172 In conclusion, Cocks thought, the pictures would remain in the storehouse "whiles I &amp; a yonger man then myselfe are likely to live &amp;c." The last word can be Wickham's: "there shalbe no need of sending any more such p'cell of comodytys for 20 yeares after."173 Paintings Given and Left The matter was not quite so bleak as it sounded. Cocks noted that he and his colleagues did salvage many of the paintings, though "it costest much to make them cleane."174 After res toration, many were certainly sold. The presumptive evidence of the Jupiter and the disappearance of the paintings from the accounts suggest that at least some were dispensed to owners who admired them and even treasured them over the gener ations. It was in the interest of traders to claim damage to cargoes en route (and not only to pictures), for it allowed them to reduce prices in the ledgers, sell the items for their original worth, and pocket the difference. Everyone did as much. Cocks's diary also mentions includes giving imported pic tures away as gifts, and these must have been in pristine state. They made good presents, being exotic and light to carry. We have seen that Jah?ng?r, the nabob and his representative, and Takanobu, daimyo of Hirado, received imagery from the English in this way. But many other people did, too. In October 1617, for example, soon after the arrival of the shipment in Hirado, Cocks, then in Miyako, referred to send ing a picture to William Adams's Japanese wife (as distinct from his English wife, Mary, at home in Kent), plus one each to their mixed-race son and daughter.175 On his way to Edo the following year (the trip from Hirado to the shogunal seat had become annual), Cocks handed out pictures, perhaps after twelve months despairing of further sales. Staying at Bingo no Tomo, near Hiroshima, he gave gifts to those who offered him hospitality: " [to] our hostis a picture and 2 musk coddes [bags of musk] ; her doughter in law a pictur and 1 musk cod; her doughter a musk codd; to her doughter in law's father a pickure and ij musk coddes."176 A few days later, near Fushimi, he "gave our hostis ij [2] pickturs, and ij musk coddes; and to Women Dono [unknown]177 1 pickture and 1 musk cod."178 A couple of days later, in Miyako, his hosts received "2 pictures and 2 musk cods."1 9 At Suruga, his host received "a picture and a musk codd."180 Interestingly, on the return journey Cocks does not mention giving imagery away, so perhaps his supply had run out. Regrettably, in all cases subjects are unstated, so matching cannot be made against the Gifts invoice or the company account pieces from the Thomas. Cocks recorded giving out pictures with named themes on only two occasions: the Stuart propaganda for Takanobu referred to above, and another gift to Mrs. Adams. On his 1616 trip to Edo, he gave the latter a mirror and "1 pikture of Solloman," most likely a Judgment of Solomon (or possibly a Solomon and the Queen ofSheba, the Israelite king's second most common pictorial situation).181 Though religious, a Solomon was easy to integrate into notions of upright rulership, an iconography extensively deployed by Japanese elites, who adorned their spaces with multiple paintings of wise mon archs and loyal subjects.182 More to the point, Solomon was an alter ego for James I, who was frequently depicted in that guise.183 One of the ships that accompanied the Gift was named the Solomon for this reason. Mrs. Adams may or may not have been informed of that layer of meaning, although a picture of a man with drawn sword holding a baby aloft (if this was a Judgment of Solomon) would warrant some elucida tion. The 1615 sailing that had left England without pictures was to be the last. No cargo departed again from London in tended for Japan.184 Following Ball's recommendation, En glish goods were largely removed in favor of regional items,</page><page sequence="20">THE ANGLO-JAPANESE PAINTING TRADE IN THE EARLY 1600S 59 and the company occupied itself thereafter with inter-Asian runs, leaving Cocks and his colleagues to their own devices. There was only one more trading voyage even from Bantam to Hirado, made again by the Advice, in the summer of 1617, followed by no more than sailings with the tiny Hirado fleet of junks to and from nearby Asian ports. Finally, the Bull came to pull the plug on the factory and take all company men and goods out, which was done on Christmas Eve 1623.185 No pictures?or anything else?left London for Ja pan again. The only subsequent reference to the import of pictures by the English East India Company appears in 1618, when Cocks requested a portrait of James I as part of a set of high-quality presents. He sent to Smythe for "the Kinge's pickture, w'th other picture 8c h?lfe a peece scarlet clo[th]." These were intended as presents for the emperor of China; they never arrived.186 In about 1800, Shiba K?kan, the person who later claimed that he saw the Dutch book dealing with Saris's arrival, was traveling along the Japan Sea coast. He stopped at the port of Kanazawa, where he was lodged by a wealthy merchant named Zeniya Gohei. Here, in Gohei's possession, he came across our painting of Jupiter, probably already classified as a Full Moon.187 How it came there is nowhere explained, but G?hei was in the shipping business, with far-flung connec tions and had perhaps obtained it from the original owners in Hirado. He took advantage of the presence of a famous Edo artist to solicit a written remark. With some self-confidence, K?kan signed his name to a document attributing the piece to Rembrandt. K?kan had no inkling of an English pedi gree?and how could he? It is germane, though, that he knew something of English art and had seen several pieces im ported by the Dutch Company long before.188 K?kan es teemed London the main center of European painting and printmaking (an error, though less egregious in 1800 than it would have been in 1615), and he had admired what he took to be a group of English sculptures of the Hirado factory period near Nagasaki, which he had sketched.189 K?kan also owned a European painting?just one, and not extant. He referred to it as very old and done in oils, and he understood the theme, saying it represented Saint Paul.190 Could it have been the English Conversion? The English painting exchange with Japan came and went in a few years. Yet its importance was more than the visual legacy remaining today. When the eighteenth-century gener ation of Masatsuna, Seizan, K?kan, and others looked back in an attempt to bring Japanese culture into closer dialogue with that of Europe, Saris and his Venus and the sending of paintings to James I were some of their points de repaire. In England erasure was more total, in the deliberate burning of the shunga and in the accidental fire of Whitehall, but in this peculiar experiment a history of understandings and misun derstandings, of attempts to gauge and predict wildly foreign and disparate markets, can be read.

Ibid., viii; and Farrington, English Factory, vol. 1, 284 n. 4, 880 (the boy concerned was Richard Hudson, son of the "discoverer" of Hudson Bay). The English currency was sterling: 12 pence (d.) = 1 shilling (s.); 20 shillings = 1 pound (?). A pound-shilling-pence sum is writ ten as ?x x/x or, if there are no pence, as ?x x/-. An English mark was 6/8. The English East India Company used money on account, that is, for computation and not for circulation as specie, in units of 10 candereen (or condrin) ? 1 mas; 10 mas = 1 tael (or thais). One tael was generally valued at 5 shillings; thus, 4 taels = ?1. Other units were the rial (spelt by Cocks "raille"), also called a Spanish dollar, or, romantically, a piece of eight, technically equal to a tael but in prac tice valued some 20 percent lower. 24.

Mercer, English Art, 145. 36. Mercer, ibid., estimates Somerset's paintings were "most unlikely" to be English and suggests they were Dutch, but without offering possi ble artists' names. 37. Rubens came to London in 1629. Only the Banqueting House of the new palace was built and painted (it is extant); see John Charlton, The Banqueting House, Whitehall (London: Her Majesty's Stationery Of fice, 1964). 38. There are no paintings by Jordaens on this theme until later in his career; best known is his Offering to Venus (also called Homage to Ve nus), ca. 1640, now in Stadtmuseum Dresden; see R.-A. d'H?lst, facob fordaens, trans. P. S. Falla (London: Sotheby's Publications, 1982), 212. 39. The family name is sometimes mistakenly romanized as Matsuura or Matsura. 40. Saris, Voyage of Captain Saris, 83. Shigenobu retired in 1601, and his grandson, Takanobu, was daimyo during the English period (the skipped generation, Hisanobu, had ruled for about eighteen months in 1601-2 but was long deceased by the time the English arrived). Until his death in 1614, Shigenobu continued to exercise a high de gree of control, using the recluse's name of Horn, which the English garbled as Foine. 41. Farrington, English Factory, vol. 1, 115 and passim. 42. The only reference to Christianity in Hirado is Saris's claim that Mat sura Nobusane (uncle of the daimyo; he calls him "Bongo samme") was a convert; see ibid., 201. 43. Ibid., 201. 44. For the second voyage of the Clove, see, ibid., vol. 2, 1580. 45. The Dutch-published French-language version had begun before the French-published one (1745) but was overtaken, as it was not com pleted until 1767. The Dutch translator is unnamed. 46. Matsuda Kiyoshi, Ydgaku no shoshiteki kenky? (Kyoto: Rinsen Shob?, 1998), 31-38. Matsuda notes that the copy extant in the Matsura col lection is signed by the famous translator Narabayashi J?bei, casting doubt on the provenance; however, Matsuda accepts it, and there is corroborative evidence; see Shiba K?kan, "Shunpar? hikki," in Naruse Fujio et al., eds., Shiba K?kan zensh?, 2 vols. (Tokyo: Yasaka Shob?, 1994), vol. 2, 92-93. Matsura Kiyoshi is generally known as Seizan, although he took that name only in 1805, after retirement. 47. For a discussion, with colorplate, see Matsuda Kiyoshi, Ydgaku no shoshiteki kenky?, 343-44, pi. 1.

K?kan gives Kiyoshi's title, Iki no kami, and Kutsuki Masatsuna's, Oki no kami; he refers to Shigenobu by a mistaken version of his retirement title, H?in (H?gen is equivalent, but lower) ; see n. 62 below. 51.

Kyoto was only infrequently known by that name before the nine teenth century. Miyako was the standard name at the turn of the sev enteenth century, and thereafter it was Ky?; Richard Cocks occasion ally used this name, written "Kyaw" or "Cyaw," see Cocks, Diary of Richard Cocks, Cape-Merchant in the English Factory in Japan, with Corre spondence, 1615-1622, ed.

Cocks refers to Gonrokur? as Gonrok Dono; dono, here and below, is an ungendered honorific. The screens were accompanied by two lacquer chests. The Dutch recipient was Jacob Specx, who sent his to John Dickinson Lamb (who, despite his En glish name, was general of the VOC in Batavia). 117. Ibid., 97. The daimyo is referred to as "Semidono king of Crates," from his title, Shima no kami. The claim that the event was the dou bling of Takanobu's stipend (from 500 to 1,000 koku; 1 koku equals about 5 bushels) is Cocks's, but this cannot be true, as even 1,000 koku is far too little for a daimyo (who would have received at least 10,000, and in fact Takanobu had 63,200 koku); moreover, the histor ical records of the Matsura house give no stipend increase during this period. See Hanshi daijiten (Tokyo: Y?k?kaku, 1988), vol. 7, 181. 118. Cocks, Diary, vol. 2, 30. The daimyo is referred to as "Sugean Dono of Umbra"; the origin of "Sugean" (Sugien?) is obscure. 119.

Mercer, English Art, 146. The painting depicted the Dutch defeat of the English at the Battle of Amboina (in modern Indonesia) in 1623, which drove the English Company from there to a new base in Ben gal; the VOC had lodged a complaint with the English crown on the grounds that the Dutch were shown basely engaged in a massacre of the unprotected English (which had in fact occurred). 126. The Ark Royal, originally the Ark Raleigh, was thus referred to by Lord Thomas Howard; see Howard to William Burghley, reprinted in John Laugh ton, ed., The Defeat of the Spanish Armada, 2nd ed. (London: Publications of the Navy Records Society, 1895), vol. 2, 185; for the ship's price, see ibid., n. 5. The ship was renamed the Ann Royal on its decommission, and it sailed until 1636, when it was broken up; see Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopedia, http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/ HMS_Ark_Royal. A ship named the Ann Royal was sent to Southeast Asia in 1617, and Cocks died aboard it on March 27, 1623, en route to England; the ship was then diverted and never returned home. See Farrington, English Factory, vol. 2, 1257 and n. 2, 1580. Although it cannot decisively be stated that the two vessels named Ann Royal are the same, such names were seldom shared, and note that the Ann Royal Cocks rode in was a battleship, not a merchantman. 127.

Bingo was the old province centering on Hiroshima; most likely, the place was actually Bingo no Tomo Ura (that is, Bingo no Tomo Beach), where Cocks would have landed; see Nihon chimei jiten (Tokyo: Asakura Shoten, 1976), vol. 2, 321-32; Cocks spelled the place name Binganatomo. 177. Perhaps a female called O-men. 178. Cocks, Diary, vol. 2, 74. 179. Ibid., 76. 180. Ibid., 80. Cocks mistakenly calls the place "Surugawa." 181. Ibid., vol. 1, 193. 182. For an introduction to Tokugawa political iconography, see Karen Gerhart, Eyes of Power: Art and Early Tokugawa Authority (Honololu: Ha waii University Press, 1999). 183.

The Advice made one final trip to Japan, under command of John Totten, in 1617, but from Bantam, and there were no goods brought from London; see Farrington, English Factory, vol. 2, 1583. 185. In the interim, ships sailed to and from Hirado to Asian ports, but without linking up with Bantam or, after 1619, when the English base relocated, with Batavia. 186. Ibid., vol. 1, 656. 187. See n. 155 above. 188. See Shiba K?kan, "Oranda ts?haku," in Nihon koten bungaku taikei (To kyo: Iwanami, 1963), vol. 64, 517 (on English prints); and idem, Saiy? nikki (Tokyo: Heibonsha T?y? Bunko, 1986), 105 (on paintings, though these are glass paintings, not panels or canvases). 189. For his judgment of European art, see Shiba K?kan, "Oranda ts?haku," 509, 511-12, 516. For the sculpture, see idem, Saiy? nikki, 101, which was then illustrated in Shiba K?kan, Saiy? ryodan, 5 vols. (Edo, 1794); for a convenient reproduction, see Naruse et al., Shiba K?kan zensh?, vol. 1, 48; the sculptures were an open-air set of images of the Buddha, carved into the rock face and so made on-site, not imported; the attribution is implausible. 190.
