<plain_text><page sequence="1">COMMUNICATIONS EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES TO VOTE-COUNTING THEORY IN NOMINATING CHOICE To THE EDITOR: Professor William H. Riker's essay on "Voting and the Summation of Preferences" (this REVIEW, Vol. 55, December 1961, pp. 900-11) is a most useful contribution. It needs to be supplemented by some comment on the applicability of this material in the field of nominating choice; also on the applicability of experimental approaches to ascertain the fre- quency with which the problems that concern Riker may in fact occur in nature. The best-known elections in the United States in which a choice among three or more alternatives is likely to occur are those in- volved in making party nominations. In either one party or the other, almost every presiden- tial year has seen three or more candidates competing for a presidential nomination. Situa- tions involving as many as six or seven candi- dates have been relatively common in state primaries, as for example those involving the gubernatorial candidates in Alabama and Texas in 1962. If the work by Duncan Black and his prede- cessors to which Riker calls attention had been known fifty years ago, the evolution of primary elections in this country might conceivably have taken a somewhat different form. Black seems, in fact, to have produced a fundamental discovery showing why either plurality choice without a majority, or a run-off between the two leading first-choice candidates, can easily result in the selection of the "wrong" candidate if the candidate or candidates at the center of the spectrum happen to be weakest in first- choice strength, although strong in second- or third-choice strength-an event which one could suppose must be relatively common. A simple illustration of a familiar kind will' make the point. Suppose three candidates, A, B, and C, of whom A and C are leading, but are strongly opposed to each other. The supporters of each reject the other, but would be willing to accept B, the man in the middle. In this case, the distribution of the voters in terms of their preference orders might be about as follows: Per Cent of Voters Preference 40 15 10 35 1st A B B C 2d B A C B 3d C C A A Black argues that in such a case, that can- didate should be chosen who could defeat each of the others when paired against them one at a time, as B could do in the present case. Yet B would be defeated in any primary election decided on the basis of an initial plurality or of a run-off between the two first-choice leaders. Such a plurality defeat is exactly what hap- pened to Governor Thomas E. Dewey in the 1948 Wisconsin primary, when the Republican vote divided Stassen 40 per cent, Dewey 24, and MacArthur 36-a situation, moreover, in which Dewey was undoubtedly the candidate of the center and could probably have defeated either of his opponents in a two-way test. We used Blacks' work to some extent in The Politics of National Party Conventions (p. 315, n. 24, and p. 489. n. 7), but if it had come to our attention sooner and we had assimilated it more fully, our treatment of the alternative vote and of the hazards of plurality voting would have been somewhat different. In a more recent study, I applied Black's criterion directly in attempting to assess the results of the Democratic convention of 1960, and con- cluded, on the basis of the Gallup poll data, that Kennedy probably could have defeated each of the other candidates in a two-way test and could therefore be regarded as a majority choice of his party (David et al, The Presidential Election and Transition 1960-61, pp. 18-19). In this particular instance, there was no evi- dence of nontransitivity of social choice. The "Arrow problem" to which Riker devotes so much attention apparently did not arise, al- though on a prior grounds, the situation was especially conducive to nontransitivity be- cause of the cross-cutting effect of the religious issue. The Arrow problem is so intriguing intellec- tually that it is easy to overlook the paucity of empirical data demonstrating cases in which it actually occurred, despite the extensive dis- cussion the problem has received over a ten- year period. If I understand Riker's essay correctly, he does not cite a single case of non- transitivity of social choice in an actual situa- tion involving real people, although he refers at pages 909-910 to various types of experi- mental work leading to somewhat conflicting results. Gordon Tullock of the University of Virginia, co-author with James M. Buchanan of The Calculus of Consent (1962), tells me that he not is aware of any documented cases in the 673</page><page sequence="2">674 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW literature, and furthermore seems to be in at least partial disagreement with Riker on the frequency with which such cases might be expected if there were enough experimental work to provide a basis for a conclusion. On a priori grounds arising out of theories of his own, Tullock believes that actual cases would be quite infrequent in situations involving only three or four alternatives, although they would occur; while Riker seems to think they might occur rather often. The subject is one that lends itself readily to classroom experimentation, as well as to use of sample surveys; and the problems involved in a simple lack of majority preference on a first- choice basis will always be important, what- ever happens to the Arrow problem. In hopes of finding a factual example of nontransitivity on a legislative issue, as well as other potential results, I made up a ballot offering three alternatives, as follows: A. Federal aid for public schools only B. Federal aid for public and private (in- cluding parochial) schools C. No federal aid for either schools Each respondent was also asked to indicate whether he considered himself a Democrat, Neutral, or Republican. This ballot was presented to a class in an in- troductory course in government and 68 usable ballots were obtained. The party split proved to be 24-D, 21-N, and 23-R. The numbers of students in the total group voting each prefer- ence order were as follows: 32 11 12 1 11 1 A A B B C C B C A C A B C B C A B A Policy A was thus a heavy majority prefer- ence on a first-choice basis, with 43 votes to 13 for B and 12 for C. Policy A was also the majority first-choice for each party group counted separately, although most of the minorities who preferred Policy B as their first choice were Democrats and most of those who preferred Policy C as their first choice were Republicans. Nothing approaching nontransi- tivity of choice could be found by taking any of these groups separately. Repeated further use of this ballot with other and varying types of groups might find some actual case of non- transitivity, but it doesn't look as easy as it did before the first attempt was made. A similar experiment was made with a ballot offering four potential candidates for the Re- publican presidential nomination of 1964, namely, Nelson Rockefeller, Richard Nixon, George Romney, and Barry Goldwater. With four candidates, 24 different preference orders are possible. In a group of 70 usable ballots, 21 of these possibilities occurred at least once, 16 at least twice, and 10 at least three times; hence only summaries of the voting can be presented. The preference distributions were as follows: Rocke- Gold- Preference feller Nixon Romney water 1st 26 18 6 20 2d 21 24 16 9 3d 11 18 29 12 4th 12 10 19 29 In this group, no one had a majority as either first choice or last choice. Rockefeller would have been the winner on a first-choice plurality basis; a run-off would have occurred between Rockefeller and Goldwater. In this group, Rockefeller would win the run-off by 41 to 29- assuming no vote-shifting-and in this case a run-off would also produce the "correct" out- come, since Rockefeller could defeat each of the other candidates in a two-way race. Nixon, however, would have defeated Goldwater in a two-way race, 42 to 28, and it could be argued that if there is to be a run-off, it should take place between Rockefeller and Nixon rather than Rockefeller and Goldwater. On a Borda count according to the method of marks (see Black), by which 3 marks are given for each first choice, 2 for each second choice, 1 for each third choice, and 0 for each fourth or last choice, Rockefeller's count was 131, Nixon's 120, Goldwater's 90, and Romney's 79. In a two-way race, however, Romney would have defeated Goldwater by 37 to 33. The results just given for outcomes in the various two-way combinations were derived from the original counting chart, set up as a series of tree diagrams in which each of the four first-choice possibilities is followed by its three second-choice possibilities, those in turn by their two third-choice possibilities, and those in turn by the corresponding fourth-choice pos- sibilities. Use of such a chart greatly facilitates the original ballot counting and thereafter. makes it possible to assemble results on any desired basis with a minimum of retabulation. When the 23 Republican ballots in this group were tabulated separately, the prefer- ence distributions were as follows:</page><page sequence="3">COMMUNICATIONS 675 Rocke- Gold- Preference feller Nixon Romney water 1st 5 7 2 9 2d 7 8 6 2 3d 5 4 9 5 4th 6 4 6 7 In this group, again no one has a first-choice majority, but Goldwater would be the winner on a plurality basis. In a run-off, however, Nixon would have his chance and would defeat Goldwater 13 to 10. On a two-way basis, Nixon defeats each of the other candidates, Goldwater defeats Rockefeller and Romney, and Rockefeller defeats Romney; there is no evidence of nontransitivity. The Borda count is Nixon 41, Goldwater 36, Rockefeller 34, and Romney 27. The four candidates were arranged from left to right in the previous tabulations on the basis of commonly held opinions about their positions in relation to each other. The voting distributions on the tree diagrams, however, provide empirical evidence for an ordering in which Rockefeller and Goldwater occupy the polar positions, with Nixon nearest to Rocke- feller and Romney nearest to Goldwater. Evi- dences of these relationships are apparent in all the diagrams, but especially in those for the 23 Republican voters, where Nixon was the second choice of all the Rockefeller voters, Romney was the principal second choice of the Goldwater voters, and Rockefeller was the second choice of most of the Nixon voters. Goldwater and Romney divided the last choice positions for the Rockefeller and Nixon voters, while Rockefeller and Nixon performed this office for the Goldwater and Romney voters. All of this suggests that the actual voting re- sults can be used to array a group of candidates along a spectrum in the absence of other evi- dence, if the voting process provides a complete array of preference data, as it could at least in classroom experiments or sample surveys. These experiments have been reported in part because the results have some intrinsic interest, but primarily to illustrate a method of experimentation that can be used either in the classroom or in sample surveys. This in turn suggests a number of conclusions of some potential interest to the profession: 1. An experimental method is available to demonstrate to students the complexity of preference structures in situations of multiple alternatives. Such properties of opinion as con- flict and consensus or the lack of it can be studied. With the addition of other scaling devices, intensity could also be studied. 2. Used repeatedly, such experiments could be used to demonstrate some of the other properties of opinion, notably stability, insta- bility, and latency-properties of special im- portance in the development of a presidential nominating choice. 3. Such experiments can be used to demon- strate the difficulties inherent in arriving at valid majority decisions in situations involving a choice among multiple alternatives of can- didates or policies. This is the classic problem of the national party conventions and of any primary election where there has been no effective pre-election screening of the candi- dates. 4. Sample surveys along these lines, used effectively with adequate publication of the results, could do much to create a more in- formed public opinion in situations involving multiple alternatives, including preconvention proceedings on presidential nominations and primary elections in states where multiple candidacies are typical. 5. If some method of accumulating the re- sults can be devised, it would be possible to obtain empirical answers to at least three questions on which answers are needed, namely, (a) whether existing primary election systems involving mere plurality choice or a run-off tend frequently to select nominees who are not in fact the majority choice of their party on any basis; (b) whether such systems tend to select from the extremes more often than from the center in situations of multiple candidacies, as Black implies at page 75 of his book; and (c) whether the problem of non- transitivity of social choice exists in nature with sufficient frequency to deserve considera- tion in the design of electoral systems. 6. In future election years, substantial re- search funds could appropriately be invested in sample surveys during the intervals preced- ing the holding of primary elections in a con- siderable number of situations involving mul- tiple candidacies. It would be desirable to pre- test situations involving three or more candi- dates that will be settled by a plurality as well as those that will be settled by a run-off. Sample surveys in as many as fifteen or twenty primary election situations in the same year could do much to clear up the questions raised in the preceding paragraph. 7. Finally, after the steps indicated, pre- sumably it would be possible to develop a vote- counting theory in nominating choice, as well as an improved system for holding primary elections, that would not only rest on a sounder empirical foundation than is presently avail-</page><page sequence="4">676 THt AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW able, but could be understood by teachers, students, and opinion leaders after it had been produced. If it is true that the existing plurality and run-off systems select from the extremes more often than from the center in situations of multiple candidacies, as Black's theories sug- gest, the result may be a type of instability or of adverse selection that complicates any move- ment toward a more effective two-party system in states where multiple candidacies are com- mon. On the other hand, it is probably one of the virtues of the national conventions that they tend to move toward the center of each party in the search for a presidential candidate who can be nominated. The reasons why this is both true and necessary can probably be dem- onstrated if the appropriate kind of sample survey evidence is obtained in future years; and classroom experiments may be useful for the same purpose in the meantime. At any rate, an exploration of Black's theories has tended to confirm my own faith in the national conven- tion system of presidential nominations.' PAUL T. DAVID University of Virgina 1 An article of mine on the presidential nominat- ing process, in the Spring 1962 issue of Law and Contemporary Problems, deals more fully with some applications of the notions discussed here. ON BRZEZINSKI'S USE OF HISTORY TO THE EDITOR: May I comment on some aspects of the article on "Deviation Control" in your March issue? Since differences in organizational purposes may condition methods of action and the kind of organizational unity that is required, I ques- tion whether "the most vital and distinctive aspect of the activities of the Church," the "spiritual" aspect "which defines its unique character," "can be altogether excluded from consideration" in a discussion of tactics toward deviation. The role of concentrated force, the rationale of command and obedience, the methods through which cohesion is best at- tained may very well differ for an organiza- tion that hopes to achieve an external re- modeling of institutions, through revolutionary seizures of power and through techniques of control preceding general consent, and for an organization that conceives its goal as a con- tinually repeated process, inherently un- coercible, occurring within individual men. The Church has always been aware that diverse and spontaneous movements of thought and action initiated by persons apart from the hierarchy have been a major factor in its suc- cess (insistence on conformity of thought and method would have decimated the roster of saints-eliminating Aquinas, among others). As a matter of historical fact, the conditions within which the Church developed gave it no chance to become "a single homogeneous unit" in which "the center" could exercise a degree of control remotely comparable to that of Stalin in the Party. Both its purposes and its pos- sibilities have required it to depend heavily on persuasion, reasoning, tradition, the rule of law, and diplomatic compromise; it has always had to combine an insistence on some fixed principles and procedures with an acceptance of a considerable degree of internal diversity and autonomy, open debate, and unresolved disagreement. Thus the conception of organiza- tional unity within which issues of deviation are to be considered has never, I suggest, been the same for the Church as for the Party. Moreover, the relation of doctrine to action differs for the two institutions. The dogmas on which the Church insists do not purport to be determinative of organizational policy in rela- tion to the course of history; they deal with relationships presumed to be invariable; and the maintenance of the faith, believed to be divinely revealed, is itself an intrinsic part of the Church's goal. The concrete applications of the faith to moral conduct and organiza- tional action are understood to be to some degree contingent on shifting circumstance, open to dispute, and subject to merely positive determination; but wherever conceptions of the ultimate, invariable relations of God and man are at issue, the Church is inherently com- mitted to seek consistency and to insist on conformity. In principle, this means that the condemnation of a statement clearly incom- compatible with dogma already defined can not properly be subordinated to any tactical consideration; to suggest that the Church could maintain its unity through ignoring such a deviation is to suggest that it should abandon what it has always conceived to be its role. But the authoritative definition of doctrines not yet clearly defined must necessarily pro- ceed with great caution and take into account the system of previous commitments and the consensus-or lack of consensus-of theo- logians. These distinctions, I suggest, are</page><page sequence="5">COMMUNICATIONS 677 highly relevant to the cases of deviation that Professor Brzezinski treats. Descending from principle to historical fact, I would also suggest that the Church's policies have always been conditioned by some major differences between its relations with other systems of power and those of the Party. It has never controlled much of the world's physical force; its economic resources have al- ways been widely dispersed and hard to protect from the acquisitive interests of outsiders; there is a measurable difference between the Soviet Union and the Papal States as a base of operations and a concern of policy. Thus the activity of the Church has been generally dependent on a policy of peaceful co-existence; and, since the nature of its goals does not com- mit it to an ultimate antagonism to any system of political and economic organization as such, it has a superior capacity for compromise and stable alliance with other centers of power. Such alliances may compensate for, but do not abolish, its intrinsic vulnerability; in practice, such alliances have often been very entangling; and, obviously, the exact state of its relations with other forces at any given moment of his- tory may be highly significant for the prospects of "deviation control." Aside from these basic differences between the Church and the Party, other differences apply to the Church on the eve of the Reforma- tion. Professor Brzezinski's summary of the Church as, like the Party, a proselytizing and "expansion-oriented" institution, in which "the success of any one unit of the movement" is "the source of satisfaction to the entire mem- bership," is strikingly inappropriate to the Church of that period. It had then, as has often been observed, the characteristic pattern of an ancien regime. Except in Spain (and there, under monarchic impetus), it was not prosely- tizing nor oriented toward expansion. Its var- ious institutional units (including the papacy) were engaged, with considerable mutual jeal- ousy, in the pursuit of particularist interests to a degree that effectively prevented concerted action on the common problems commonly recognized as serious: internal corruption, the century-old Hussite heresy, the advance of the Turks. Its financial resources were under strain, maldistributed, and very noticeably often misspent for non-organizational purposes. Powers once demanded as essential to its operation-especially, control over the appoint- ment of its own officers-had been, in large areas, relinquished. Its officials (including in- cumbents of the papacy) were too often ill- suited to and uninterested in the organizational functions and insensitive to new movements of public opinion. The trahison des clercs was well under way; popular respect for the 6lite was at an all-time low. Reform movements were still rudimentary. Is the problem of deviation in an ancien regime comparable to the problem of deviation in a revolutionary movement on the make? Early Protestantism could perhaps have provided case-histories somewhat comparable with the case of Titoism; but if one must seek a twentieth-century analogy to the situation of the sixteenth-century Church, some of the dilemmas of "capitalistic democracy" are at least as relevant as those of international Communism. Aside from my distrust of Professor Brzezin- ski's premises, I am bewildered by his presenta- tion of the case of Luther and the inferences he draws from it. I should have expected an assessment of tactics toward a doctrinal devi- ant to be based on a careful examination of available alternatives in the light of the total situation at the time: the immediate pattern of interests, purposes, antagonisms, loyalties; the immediate and potential resources of the organization and the deviant, including their immediate and potential allies; the content of the deviant doctrine, its implications, its com- patibility or incompatibility with previous commitments, its potential appeal to others. Professor Brzezinski's resume of factors that had in the remote past been useful to organiza- tional unity and papal leadership is no sub- stitute for an analysis of the instruments available in 1517. The Crusades and the military orders are as irrelevant to considera- tion of Leo X versus Luther as Danegeld and the Domesday Survey would be to considera- tion of the Stuarts versus Parliament. The mendicant orders and the universities were not the assets they once had been; one cold plausibly argue that they had become liabili- ties. One wonders why Professor Brzezinski explains the theory of episcopal equality rather than the current theory and status of conciliar- ism; why he ignores such a vitally relevant topic as the current structure of ecclesiastical finance; why, disregarding the effects of the concordats and their English equivalents, he supposes that the transformation of the Church into a composite of national units was occurring only "underneath the surface" (and why he regards this as analogous to a transformation in the Communist Party, whose officers, I believe, have not yet been appointed by fellow-travel- lers); why, except for a vague allusion to "national power" (the Elector of Saxony?), he has nothing to say about the religious, political, economic, and intellectual situation in Ger- many.</page><page sequence="6">678 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW His conception of the late-medieval Inquisi- tion as an instrument of papal control and a parallel to the Stalinist purges is remarkable. Control of the Spanish Inquisition had been ceded to Ferdinand; it was an instrument of national unification and of reforming piety. Elsewhere, pre-Reformation applications of the Inquisition were typically sporadic and hap- hazard, largely dominated by local antago- nisms, fears, and avarice, or by the local In- quisitor's professional zeal, and dependent on the collaboration of secular government. (In- cidentally, there was an authentic campaign against witchcraft as such.) Professor Brzezin- ski's assurance that the Inquisition "doubtless" increased papal power is oddly at variance with the actual preoccupations of the Renassiance popes, notably tolerant of free-thinking and not greatly concerned with general leadership in the Church, which they regarded chiefly as the source of certain kinds of income to be spent on the local projects in which they were en- grossed. Sixtus IV, in fact, had been willing to jeopardize the universal role of the papacy to transform it into an hereditary monarchy in the Papal States; this abortive project was not, I must add, an ecclesiastical version of "social- ism in one country." Professor Brzezinski's summary of the Stalinist spiral ("the result of the purges was a further concentration of power at the center. The fear of violence intensified the violence, and the violence . . . intensified the fear") scarcely applies to the pre-Reforma- tion Church, in which the ultramontane influ- ence of the papacy was diminishing and was exerted largely through financial and political deals; in which doctrinal debate was carried on with more than usual freedom, and wide- spread, devastating criticism of every facet of the organization, including the papacy, went on unchecked; in which the most important interplay of fear and violence was connected with the activities of quite unpurgeable armies in Italy. The Lutheran movement was not, of course, "the first major crisis of unity" that the Church had faced. It had struggled for centuries with Arianism; it was still vainly attempting to heal the centuries-old schism of East and West; it had successfully dealt with widespread popular heresies through a major effort requiring a variety of techniques; more recently, it had resolved a quarter-century schism, but was still unable to muster up sufficient resources of force or persuasion to counter the Hussite heresy. Moreover, when Luther first attracted notice, no one imagined that his theological statements, neither novel nor clearly heretical, would lead to "a crisis of unity"; his main teachings had been expressed a few years earlier by the French theologian, Lef evre d'Rtaples, with no effect on the popular mind. And, as between Luther and Friar Tetzel, it was Tetzel who talked heresy. Initiative in opposi- tion to Luther did not come from "the center" (that easy-going connoisseur, Leo X, scarcely fits the role of Stalin), but from the Archbishop of Mainz and the Dominicans, whose zeal to get Luther silenced was directly motivated by his effect on their lucrative racket. Leo X had to be prodded into taking an interest in what he originally, and with fifty per cent accuracy, regarded as a "squabble of monks." Far from "precipitously" following a routine technique with Luther, Leo, bedeviled by conflicting pressures, had great difficulty in making up his mind what to do about him; the order of arrest of August, 1518 (based on an indictment, not a judgment) followed months of indecision and was quickly withdrawn; the subsequent pro- longation of debate, which gave Luther wider publicity and assisted him to clarify his thoughts, was partly due to the influence of his various defenders, partly to the difficulty of catching him in any statement that could with assurance be "branded heretical," and partly to some political strategy with regard to the imperial election, which Leo, unlike Professor Brzezinski, considered worth taking into ac- count. Granting that the tactics adopted were un- successful, I remain unimpressed by the alter- natives Professor Brzezinski proposes. His suggestion of a "quiet liquidation" of Luther, without "personalizing the conflict (!)," with a subsequent "open condemnation" (by whom?) "of the improper views" (which?) is quite enchanting, but not quite convincing. I assume that Professor Brzezinski does not mean that preventative assassination of every critic who might later have become a heretic or schismatic should have been adopted as a general Refor- mation-averting policy: aside from the sizable administrative difficulties it would have en- tailed, and some incompatibility with the Church's professed goals and habitual pro- cedures, such a wholesale assault on the popu- lation of Europe could scarcely have been kept quiet and might, indeed, have contributed to the result it aimed to prevent. Assuming that he contemplates the preventative assassin- ation of Luther only, I can only inquire how anyone could possibly have known, before the' debate developed, that it would be Luther's "improper views," rather than those of numer- ous other people, that would spark an explosion --especially as no one had reason to think that an explosion was imminent. His alternative</page><page sequence="7">COMMUNICATIONS 679 recommendation, that Luther should have been "ignored," may seem superficially more feasible; however, even if "the center" had "refused to engage in open debate," it could not possibly have silenced other debaters (I suspect that Professor Brzezinski is visualizing the Stalinist dictatorship rather than the pre- Reformation Church); and if Luther's views had developed under this stimulus, could the pope have continued to ignore them? Professor Brzezinski's confidence that, if Luther could have been eliminated or ignored, the Protestant split would probably have been averted is gratuitous. It tacitly assumes a number of highly controversial theses-about the causes of the Reformation, the indispensability of Luther's role, his mental processes, the reasons for his influence, the potentialities of alterna- tive movements-that can not be taken for granted in this fashion. There is a mass of historical discussion on the difficult questions that Professor Brzezinski glides over here; apparently he is unfamiliar with the literature on the topic and unaware of the terms in which the discussion is, and must be, carried on. The fact that Jansenism was successfully contained by somewhat different tactics is no indication that these tactics could have been successfully applied to Lutheranism. Professor Brzezinski's analysis ignores significant differ- ences in the situations in which these two doctrinally somewhat similar movements ap- peared-differences that undermined the po- tential appeal of Jansenism, regardless of the tactics used. France was not Germany, with its special problems and frustrations; Jansenism lacked the significant political and economic connotations associated with Luther's religious teachings; the French kings had long since been entrenched, through generally satisfactory con- cordats with the papacy, in ecclesiastical rights that German princes gained only by going Protestant; even at the height of Reformation fervor, Calvinism had captured only a fraction of Frenchmen and, in the seventeenth century, the Huguenots were declining in numbers and zeal. Moreover, Lutheranism and Jansenism are separated by a period in which, unobserved by Professor Brzezinski, the Catholic Church had successfully remodelled and tightened its organization, cleaned up its scandals, rear- ranged its budget, improved the quality of its personnel, clarified many of its doctrines, de- veloped new techniques of control and persua- sion to fit the needs and temper of the time, regained the respect of its continuing members, intensified their religious earnestness, and em- barked, with notable success in France and elsewhere, on a program of proselytization and expansion. (It had, one might say, adapted itself to the Cold War through ecclesiastical equivalents to, e.g., the Dennis Case, NATO, the Common Market, and the Ford Founda- tion.) Professor Brzezinski's thesis that experience with Luther had made the Church "deviation- conscious" and thus prepared it for a more moderate handling of the Jansenist problem slides over the fact that the Church had met many cases of "deviation" since the time of Luther and handled them in various ways, though usually with greater decisiveness and harshness rather than greater moderation. His account of the Jansenist controversy is dis- torted by his failure to notice that the Gallican- ism of the French episcopacy and that of the French monarchy were by no means identical nor even, usually, allied; that the papal treat- ment of Jansenism was conditioned by several considerations besides a hope to keep the Jansenists in the fold; that when the Jansenists focussed their attacks on the Jesuits they quite accurately selected their actual opponent; that the French monarchy (i.e., in effect, Richelieu, Mazarin, and Louis XIV) was actively anti- Jansenist; that Mazarin and Louis XIV were, in fact, instigators of repeated attempts to secure more thorough-going papal condemna- tions. The chance that "France might be lost" had its roots, not in Jansenism, but in epis- copal Gallicanism-which actually "became defiance" as a result of Innocent XI's intran- sigence on the quite undoctrinal issue of the r6gale, which temporarily allied the king and the Gallican bishops. The schismatic move- ment, however, quickly collapsed, since Louis had been playing for a limited objective and was thoroughly averse to heading a schismatic and potentially anti-monarchic church. There is no reason to think that Jansenist defiance could ever have had a greater effect. Historical comparison can be valuable, but it is always dangerous-history is so annoyingly specific. I have argued that Professor Brzezin- ski's analogies and inferences are based on some serious misconceptions of the situations that he discusses. I have not commented on some in- cidental errors, not crucial to his theses. EWART LEWIS berlin, Ohio</page><page sequence="8">680 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW ON METHOD, ANALOGY, AND DETERMINISM To TIL, EDITOR: Much, if not all, of the disagreement between Mrs. Lewis and myself involves ways of looking at the world, of approach and method. She is concerned with making certain that the im- mensely complex pattern of reality is not dis- torted or oversimplified by theoretical analysis. I am concerned lest this admittedly complex reality does not obstruct entirely any theoreti- cal analysis or suggestive generalizations. Thus in comparing the Church and the Party it is not sufficient merely to list a series of factual parallels or differences. It is also essen- tial to compare the two organizations in terms of their dynamic relationship to the world around them, the degree of homogeneity and doctrinal commitment relative to that world in different times, and not just one organization with the other. In this connection, two simple definitions are in order: "Analogy: A relation of likeness between two things or of one thing to or with another, consisting in the resemblance not of the things themselves but of two or more attributes, circumstances, or effects"; "Iden- tity: Sameness of essential character. Sameness in all that constitutes the objective reality of a thing; self-sameness; oneness." (Webster Col- legiate Dictionary, 1946, italics in original.) Mrs. Lewis' comments, sometimes quite acute, might have been a great deal more rele- vant had she been more observant of these dis- tinctions. Unfortunately, she did not. Thus much of her effort to prove that the Catholic Church is not the Communist Party is superfluous. I agree that it is not. However, to prove that it is not (i.e., non-identity) is not to prove that there are no pertinent resemblances in orienta- tion, function and organization (i.e., analogy). To assert simply that there were, and are, significant differences, or that the Church's "conception" of unity "has never . . . been the same" as for the Party, or that the Papacy did not have the same power as Stalin, is to suggest that the only basis for making compar- isons is a complete identity in experience and behavior, which is simply bad logic for then there would be nothing to compare. Furthermore, my purpose was not merely to describe a certain similarity in events or pat- terns although I am pleased that Mrs. Lewis' delightfully specific historical treatise does not shake the factual basis of my effort. I was con- cerned with attempting some generalizations concerning deviation-control on the basis of the analogous organizational experience of two international, doctrinal movements which are "action-oriented." Mrs. Lewis, in her effort to demonstrate what appeared to me to be obvi- ous differences between the Church and the Communist Party, may or may not be right when she states categorically that the Church conceived its "goal as . . . inherently uncoere- ible" but the fact is that coercion was- used; and it was with organizational behavior, and its consequences, that I was concerned. It is also quite true that in the time under discussion the Church was not actively engaged in prose- lytization. I did not say it was. However, it did before and after the period under discussion; at a certain stage the Communist movement also was not actively proselytizing or expanding. That, however, does not prove that either movement is not "inherently committed to proselytization" and extra ecclesiam, nulla salus was taken literally for a long time, with certain operational consequences. (Incidentally, Mrs. Lewis' description of the inner decay of the Church on the eve of the unity-crisis bears striking resemblance-I hope she will forgive me-to the inner corruption of the Kremlin in the years 1945-1948, so well described by Djilas in his recent Conversations with Stalin.) Her defense of the Inquisition as an instru- ment of "reforming piety" is quaint although not central to the issue at hand. (From the point of view of the orthodox Stalinist, the purge was also a "reforming" instrument of purification.), However, even her generous version of it does not contradict the proposition that its effect was the dogmatization of the movement and centripetal political pressure. Furthermore, in her effort to depict the late medieval Church as a pluralist, tolerant com- munity of prayerful pacifists practising "open debate and unresolved disagreement," Mrs. Lewis ignores such minor details as the burn- ing of John Huss and Jerome of Prague by the Council of Constance or the little military expedition led by Cardinal Cesarini, the Papal legate, to suppress the deviants in Bohemia. Nor were the Crusades as anachronistic to Papal ?ower as she alleges; as late as 1459 Pius II organized a Congress of European princes in order to prepare one. Mrs. Lewis is somewhat too hasty in alleging that I consider the factors which made for the growth of Papal power to be the factors of power available to the Papacy for dealing with Luther. They were not. In the course of a very brief summary I had no intention of exploring all the ramifications of the relationship between the Papacy and Luther-as I also did not when</page><page sequence="9">COMMUNICATIONS 681 dealing with the Stalin-Tito conflict. Instead, I wished to point to certain specific errors of judgment in the center's handling of the crisis. That Luther was not taken seriously in the beginning is quite true but it is not much of an argument. Neither was Tito-but so what? Her subsequent comments, designed to demon- strate that other means also would not have been very effective (although she does find the thought of assassinating Luther "enchanting" !) strongly imply that the Reformation was in- evitable, irrespective of what the Papacy did with regard to Luther. Contrary to this rigid notion, H. Jedin in his authoritative A History of the Council of Trent indicates clearly that errors in handling Luther were of some im- portance. I suppose a determinist could argue that National Communism was inevitable, ir- respective of Stalin's handling of Tito. Deter- minists have always the advantage of arguing backwards from events which did happen, but that does not necessarily establish the true causes of the events or the degree of probability of alternatives. Contrary to Mrs. Lewis, the Luther case was "the first major crisis of unity" which the Church, as the type of doctrinal, international organization defined in my paper, had faced. So was Tito with respect to the Communist movement, irrespective of Trotsky, Bukharin, the Mensheviks, etc. Conceding Mrs. Lewis' superior knowledge of medieval history (which with justification she explicitly stresses) I am not unaware of Arianism, the East-West schism, etc. My point is that both Christianity and Communism have experienced organiza- tional transformations in relationship to new forms of social-political organization as well as their own expansion. Lastly, Mrs. Lewis' argument that the Church was more effective against Jansenism because it "had successfully remodeled and tightened its organization . . . clarified many of its doctrines, developed new techniques of con- trol and persuasion . . . " etc., simply elabo- rates some of my own points. (Mrs. Lewis describes these as "ecclesiastical equivalents to, e.g., the Dennis Case, NATO, the Common Market, and The Ford Foundation." Might we have avoided our disagreement had I used the word "equivalent" instead of analogy?) The Church had learned its lesson, it became more effective, finally it succeeded. However, here too, Mrs. Lewis falls victim to a propensity to substitute determinism for explanation. Thus in a curious contradiction to her perfectly sound and apt observations cited above, Mrs. Lewis concludes by flatly asserting that "There is no reason to think that Jansenist defiance could ever have had a greater effect." Either her first point quoted above is quite irrelevant or her second quote is quite untrue. To sum up: Mrs. Lewis' criticism suffers from a confusion of analogy with identity which makes it difficult for her to understand a comparative study; from a consequent mis- understanding of my purpose, which was to generalize some principles of deviation-control and not merely to establish factually descrip- tive symmetry; and from implicit determinism. ZBIGNIEW BRZEZINSKI Columbia University TO THE EDITOR: I agree with Professor Brzezinski that the difference between us is partly one of approach and method. But may I restate that difference? There are of course no identities in history; but I would argue that cause-and-effect con- clusions drawn from a comparison of non-iden- tical historical situations can be safely made only if one examines, for each instance, the dif- ferences as carefully as the resemblances. How otherwise can one know whether the differ- ences were not crucial to the outcome? And if one does not examine equally the context of differences, how can one be sure that what ap- pear to be similarities are really similar?-My position is certainly "determinist," in the sense that I am accustomed to think that historical processes are determined by the interplay of many factors, and that I can conceive of no way to establish what might have been the effect of changing any single factor except through examing its role in relation to the whole situa- tional context. I consider it debatable whether a different tactic toward Luther could have averted the Protestant Reformation; I see no reason to believe that Jansenism, however de- fiant, could ever have induced the splitting off of the French church; but I think that the burden of proof is on Professor Brzezinski, and that he has failed to shoulder it. But our difference is also, I think, a dispute on questions of fact; we apparently disagree widely as to the analogies between the Church and the Party "in terms of their dynamic rela- tionship to the world around them, the degree of homogeneity and doctrinal commitment rel- ative to that world," in the periods under con- sideration. It was, I thought, precisely from this viewpoint that I criticized Professor Brzezinski's opinions about the state of the Church on the eve of the Reformation; and an assessment of "the dynamic relationship" of the seventeenth-century Church "to the world around it" seems to me rather significantly af-</page><page sequence="10">682 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW fected by our differences of opinion as to whether it was still "seeking new formulae for doctrinal and organizational unity" or had al- ready found them; whether its post-Reforma- tion adjustments had tended toward less or greater doctrinal rigidity; and what was the actual posture of "the most influential Catholic monarchy in Europe." Two specific points in his reply require some comment. I apologize to him for having misin- terpreted his phrase, "its first major crisis of unity." His assumption that the stages of Church and Party history can be made com- parable through the use of extremely different time-scales confused me; and, since the Church had been, in many important respects, "a composite of nationally-based units" ever since the break-up of the Roman Empire and the conversion of the barbarian kingdoms, I failed and still fail-to understand where in its history Professor Brzezinski locates an "inter- nationalization" of the Church that both cor- responds to the Party's conquests of the states of Central Europe and also enables him to de- fine the case of Luther as a subsequent "first." Second, without any wish to "defend" the Spanish Inquisition, to discover "pacifists" in the pre-Reformation Church, or to ignore the burning of Huss and the Cesarini expedi- tion, I continue to wonder just how "the power of the center" had been increased by applica- tions of violence that were made by an institu- tion it could not control, were guided by pur- poses distinct from its own, and that failed to accomplish their intention. The effective "pluralism" of the structure of power in the pre-Reformation Church, the comparative doctrinal tolerance of the Renaissance papacy, and the conspicuous existence of "open debate and unresolved disagreement" are, I believe, commonly recognized features of the Church of this period; it cost me no "effort" to state them. EWART LEWIS Oberlin, Ohio TO THE EDITOR: While Mrs. Lewis is right that the issue is primarily one of method, her argument that it is incumbent upon me to examine all the simi- larities and all the differences between the me- dieval Church and the Communist movement before generalizing about deviation-control is absurd. That she really does not mean it is shown in her listing of several "ecclesiastical equivalents to NATO, the Ford Foundation, etc." without once troubling to point out cer- tain obvious differences. Her request is tanta- mount to requiring every medical researcher engaged in cancer research on mice for the purpose of discovering a cure for human cancer to qualify any findings by a statement that he realizes that a mouse is not a man, certain organic similarities apart. - For her flat assertion that Lutheranism had to come and Jansenism had to fail, her only argument is the deterministic one that this is how it turned out. My point was to suggest that methods used in handling these crises had some bearing on their outcome. Whether they might have succeeded in preventing a rupture is a matter of speculative judgment, and the demand for "proof" is simply unrealistic. On the "internationalization" of the Church, my point was and is that this process was con- nected with the emergence of effective, homog- enous political units with a sense of national identity. Her dating of this process is wrong. Finally, the center's power was both expressed and then maximized by initiatives such as the attempted crusade or the Cesarini expedition, a cumulative process, involving the dynamic interaction of the right to initiative and the consequences of such initiative, quite familiar to students of political power. The reader can judge whether her description of the pre-Refor- mation Church as tolerant of "open debate and unresolved disagreement," and her refer- ence to the burning of Huss and to the Cesarini expedition against deviants are compatible. ZBIGNIEw BRZEZINSKI Columbia University REJOINDER TO CROPSEY TO THE EDITOR: Cropsey in his reply to my article (in the June issue, pp. 353-359) argues that in order to make my case I must refute certain of Strauss's assertions as to the implications of positivism and historicism, viz., that positivism leads logically to historicism and that both positivism and historicism are vitiated by the application of each to itself. This, of course, is neatly to shift the burden of proof. I was only required to demonstrate that Strauss had not made his case. Cropsey deals with my argu- ment concerning the relation between positiv- ism and historicism by ignoring it. However, later in his essay he asserts that I admit the historicist implications of positivism because I</page><page sequence="11">COMMUNICATIONS 683 refuse to argue that science itself is "more worthy than other pursuits." (p. 356) I still reply, as, indeed, I wrote in my original essay: it is not a contradiction to assert that the method of science is the only way in which to discover truth, and at the same time to recog- nize that there is nothing in the structure of the universe which justifies acquiring knowledge.' Cropsey also rejects my characterization of Strauss's efforts as an attempt to fuse norma- tive and descriptive judgments. I may mis- understand both Strauss and him here, but the following observations seem in order: A. The proposition that one cannot describe without evaluating must mean, it seems to me, one of two things. Either it is psychologically impossible to do so, or, given the structure of reality, it is logically impossible to do so. Since, I gather, Strauss is not making a psychological case, he must be developing an ontological argument. To me such an argument involves the fusion by which I characterized it. B. It is true that Strauss (as I indicated in my original essay) qualifies his argument by the word "important." Again, however, it seems to me that only two alternatives exist. Either it is possible to describe social phenomena with- out evaluating or it is not. Certainly Strauss offers us no coherent reason for limiting his claim to "important" phenomena only. C. In his rejoinder Cropsey characterizes Strauss's position as simply that " . . . judg- ments of value are not to be excluded from the class of judgments as to fact, and that such judgments as to value cannot be excised from social science without sterilizing it." This argu- ment seems to constitute a retreat from Strauss's original position. However, it does not strengthen his argument, for if judgments of fact and judgments of value are indeed differ- ent, although of the same class, it is not im- possible on the face of it to make important 1 Because I argue that the direction of a scientist's efforts may be determined by his in- terests or commitments, Cropsey builds up a fanciful case, whereby I am supposed to mistake Nagel's critique of Weber for his critique of Strauss and at the same time really to take Weber's position. Since any comparison of my position with Nagel's will reveal that the two are almost exactly the same, I can be confused on this point only if Nagel is. And the remarks made are only irrelevant to a rounded discussion of the relationship between science and values if one assumes the correctness of Cropsey's posi- tion. Compare p. 344 of my essay with pp. 486-7 of N. Nagel, The Structure of Science (New York, 1961). judgments of fact without making judgments of value.2 Cropsey, incidentally, reverses my charge against Strauss and accuses me of confusing moral with other value judgments. Readers can verify this for themselves, but it still seems to me that when Strauss offers as examples of evaluation the terms "noble" and "base" and "prudent" and "imprudent," without dis- tinguishing between them, in an attempt to prove the "objectivity" of value judgments, he is involved in a confusion of some sort. Next, and most important, Cropsey denies that Strauss has shifted his position as to the dependence of natural right upon classical cosmology. (He does not, incidentally, deny my point as to Strauss's shift from Hobbes to Machiavelli.) His argument here is in two parts. First, he asserts that, in the passage I quote from Natural Right and History, Strauss is merely stating the conventional position, a position which his writing transcends. Second, Cropsey offers some positive arguments to demonstrate that, in fact, natural right is not dependent upon classical physics or classical cosmology. As to the first, the passage I quoted from Strauss concludes as follows: The fundamental dilemma, in whose grip we are, is caused by the victory of modern natural sci- ence. An adequate solution to the problem of natural right cannot be found before this basic problem has been solved. Needless to say, the present lectures cannot deal with this problem. They will have to be limited to that aspect of the problem of natural right which can be clarified within the confines of the social sciences.3 2 It is conceivable that Strauss and Cropsey are merely asserting that social scientists are forced to make judgments of significance. I con- sidered this possibility while writing my original essay but rejected it because, frankly, I regarded such an argument as essentially trivial. No reputa- ble social scientist in the empirical tradition would deny the point, but to use the term "value judgment" so broadly as to include under one rubric both these kinds of judgments and moral judgments proper is to prove one's case by defi- nition and to obscure the issues involved. Par- ticular judgments of significance are compatible with a variety of value systems, as is evidenced by the fact that many people who agree as to the relevant facts still disagree as to which course of action is morally correct in a given situation. 3 Leo Strauss, Natural Right and History (NRII) (Chicago, 1952), p. 8.</page><page sequence="12">684 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW I defy any reasonable man to take these words as a summary of the views of others. One can find additional support for my analysis on pages 78-9, 166, and 172 of Natural Right and History, but I should like, at this point, to quote from a review which Strauss wrote for Social Research somewhat earlier (in 1946) and which is reprinted in What Is Political Philosophy? (pp. 284-286). The review is of Anton C. Pegis (ed.), Basic Writings of Saint Thomas Aquinas. Strauss criticizes Pegis's introduction to the volume as follows: An introduction to the work of Thomas must point the way toward overcoming the typical present-day obstacles which prevent its genuine understanding. These obstacles are the two forces that dominate all present-day thought-science and history. With regard to science Pegis simply capitulates; he grants that there is "much bad science" in Thomas, yet he holds that this does not affect the value of his philosophy. Can one as easily as that get rid of the enormous difficulty presented by the inseparable connection between Thomas' physics and his natural theology? It would have been more fruitful to indicate why and how far the questions raised by Thomist, or Aristotelian, physics retain their full significance regardless of any progress that modern science has achieved by raising questions of an entirely different type.4 The passage speaks for itself. As to the second, Cropsey offers two argu- 4 It is true that at one place in NRH (not the passage Cropsey cites, but rather a passage on p. 94) Strauss does imply that classic natural right may not be logically related to classical cosmology. However, given the other evidence, all we can assume from this is that Strauss was of two minds on the question. I should say here that in summarizing Strauss's historical discus- sion I have, in one sense, been unfair. As far as I can determine Strauss's presentation of the views of the classics is in itself a demonstration of the reasonableness of these views, just as the use of the dialogue form in Plato's Republic is, through the example of Socrates, a demonstra- tion of the virtues of philosophy. My failure to summarize the classics (as Strauss views them) in more detail is based on my conviction that no matter how reasonable some of these views seem, the systematic issues are paramount. Incidentally, Cropsey's remarks as to the relevance of indeterminism (his statement of the principle is incorrect or at least one-sided) to a full discussion of the implications of contem- porary physics do not, then, touch on the issues involved. ments designed to demonstrate that the natural right position does not depend upon classical physics. In the first he tells us that the natural is good essentially because it simply makes sense to call each thing "excellent" "in the de- gree to which it can do the things for which its species is naturally equipped." (p. 356) It follows from this that, since man is most naturally defined in terms of reason, both his natural end and his "excellence" are to be de- fined in these terms. Of course, most contemporary empiricists would agree that it makes sense to characterize man (in contradistinction to other animals) by his ability to reason. Cropsey's statement of the classical position, then, does not differentiate it clearly from the modern. The real differences between the classical (and I assume Strauss's) and the modern posi- tions lie (1) in the analysis of what is meant by the word reason, and (2) in the implications of the classification. A definition of man as a reasoning animal does not logically entail the assumption of one "natural end" as against any other unless it can be demonstrated that it is impossible to say anything meaningful about men except in terms of the "natural end" or standard which is accepted. (One can, for exam- ple, agree as to the uniqueness of the capacity to reason and argue for an aesthetic life or a life dedicated to the acquisition of power.) I am convinced that Strauss recognizes this, and that his attack on what he calls the reduction- ism of modern science, and his insistence that neither man nor society can be understood ex- cept in terms of its "end," is based on this recognition. Strauss can demonstrate this assertion in either one of two ways. Either he can argue that contemporary science, contrary to con- ventional belief, is teleological, or he can argue that while other natural objects can be ana- lyzed non-teleologically man to be understood, must be examined in terms of a "natural end." Strauss does not attempt the first task, and, in fact, Cropsey now denies that he has to do so. The second involves tremendous difficulties, for somehow one must demonstrate that in some decisive way man is different from other natu- ral objects. All that Strauss ever offers us here are remarks about man's reason and conscience. But both "reason" and "conscience" can be dealt with by a social science which (broadly), takes it s bearings from natural science. The second argument involves an attempt by Cropsey to justify understanding provided by "the light of nature." This argument also in- volves an attack upon the verification princi- ple. The statement that propositions must be</page><page sequence="13">COMMUNICATIONS 685 capable of -empirical verification to be meaning- ful, Cropsey argues, is not itself an empirical proposition, but rests on certain assumptions. He then suggests "intelligibility" as a criterion for knowledge and offers the example of the "unmoved mover." Cropsey is, of course, care- ful to disassociate himself from the example which means, presumably, that he cannot be held responsible for it. Let us examine the posi- tion and the example anyway. The assertion that knowledge must be re- lated to observation is much more compelling than any particular empirical proposition. It is implicit in the very definition of knowledge it- self. Unless we insist upon this assumption there is no conceivable way of differentiating fact from fantasy, of differentiating "intelligi- ble" little green devils from "intelligible" auto- mobiles. The requirement does not rule out propositions which, it is claimed, may consti- tute a necessary base for any particular set of statements or, indeed, for all of science. Un- fortunately these tend, on the whole, to be ex- tremely difficult to handle in any meaningful way. The assumption of an unmoved mover is neither more nor less self-contradictory than the assumption of a universe infinite in time and space, and neither of these (except for some comforting anthropomorphic elements in the first) is more or less contradictory than the assumption that the universe is its own un- moved mover.5 5 Cropsey asserts that the verification prin- ciple rests on the assumption that "to be is to be sensible," and suggests as an alternative the as- sumption that "to be is to be intelligible." If I understand him correctly the following remarks are in order: First, the statement is simply not true. One may accept the possibility of the exist- ence of objects which, by definition, cannot be "sensed," and still argue that we can only have legitimate knowledge of that which can in some way be related to sense experience. Second, the statement is inaccurate. The principle should be stated as: "to be is to be sensible or capable of being related to things sensed in certain deter- minate ways." Scientists believed in the existence of atoms before they had observed them or even were sure they could be observed. Third, the dichotomy is a false one. Contemporary em- piricists would agree that "to be is to be in- telligible," i.e., capable of being related to a general body of knowledge and explained in terms of general scientific laws. The real difference between Cropsey and me lies in our views as to what constitutes "intelligibility." To the con- temporary definition, Cropsey would add under- standing in terms of some "end" or "essence." Finally, in my essay I argued that while Strauss cites America as the only country founded on the basis of an anti-Machiavellian tradition, the whole thrust of his analysis is to the effect that the American tradition is based on Locke, and, hence, represents "respectable" Machiavellianism. Cropsey's reply cites Strauss's chapter on Rousseau in Natural Right and History to prove that this interpretation is incorrect. However, there is no evidence in Strauss's writing that he regards Rousseau as having exercised any significant influence on the American experience. Thus, Cropsey's rejoinder is clearly irrelevant. Further, since Rousseau is regarded by Strauss as the source of modern totalitarianism, his remarks actually suggest that Strauss's critique of American values may be even more fundamental than I originally contended. Just one minor point. Cropsey argues that my characterization of scientists as being moti- vated by their commitments and interests "in- criminates" scientists and social scientists. His point is that by interest I must mean "self- interest." In my use of the term I was thinking primarily of "curiosity," but I accept Cropsey's expansion of it. Only a very sanctimonious per- son would refuse to admit that scientists and social scientists are motivated, in part, by the desire for professional advancement and recog- nition, or even by the feeling of power which comes from mastering an element of reality. It is indeed a bloodless morality which denies a role to legitimate self-interest of this type. STANLEY ROTHMAN Smith College TO THE EDITOR: The exchange between Professors Rothman and Cropsey on "The Revival of Classical Political Philosophy" (June, 1962) turns in one important instance on the well known remarks of Professor Leo Strauss at pp. 7-8 of his Natural Right and History. There Strauss speaks of the "victory," not the successes, of modern natural science. This victory "would seem to have" destroyed the teleological view of the universe, "of which the teleological view of man forms a part." The victory, in turn, poses a "fundamental dilemma": on the one hand men today can accept both a non-teleo- logical moral doctrine and a non-teleological science, or they can accept a teleological moral doctrine and a non-teleological science. The statement "to be is to be intelligible" In Cropsey's terms requires the existence of such essences or ends.</page><page sequence="14">686 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW Here-and this is the only instance if I may say so-I have some sympathy for Professor Rothman. This is not the best example of Strauss's clarity nor is there anything "per- fectly obvious" about the position he adopts. Cropsey might better honor his mentor by acknowledging that the latter's work is not free of difficulties. And whether Cropsey would want to say so or not, I should venture to sug- gest that these difficulties stem essentially from the fact that Strauss has not worked out a metaphysics for himself. Indeed, this is the fundamental distinction between him and the "Thomists." Finally, Cropsey should be aware that "Thomists" (they are not Straussians, after all) do not find themselves impaled on the "teleological moral doctrine"- "non-teleolog- ical science" horns of Strauss's dilemma. The exclusion of finality from the considerations of modern science is a "methodological require- ment" of modern science-the necessary con- sequence of its empirico-logical structure. What is settled about the reality of final cause by the silence of the natural sciences? This silence points to the relationship between metaphysics and the modern sciences and to the resolution of the "dilemma." JAMES M. ROHERTY Mount Mary College</page></plain_text>
