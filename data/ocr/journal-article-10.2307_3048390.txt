<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kirchner in Dresden 335 DONALD E. GORDON With its national groups and movements and its international exhibitions and manifestos, the decade from 1905 to 1914 appears in retrospect to have been one of the major turning- points in post-Renaissance European painting. The artistic styles, the attitudes and aesthetics established then have re- mained relevant, in their basic essentials, to artists of later twentieth century generations (including our own). Yet we possess surprisingly little concrete knowledge of the art of the period outside of Paris. The Kiinstler-Gruppe Briicke, for ex- ample, was founded in Dresden more than sixty years ago as one of the first of these consciously modern groups; yet until recently little has been known with documented certainty about the Briicke's early art. In part this has been due to the chronological ambiguities surrounding the early development of the Briicke's central figure, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner.' Despite important European research and publication in the past dec- ade,2 the major documents pertaining to Kirchner's develop- ment have remained largely inaccessible-in the Kirchner Es- tate and related Archive," and especially in the city of Dresden itself.4 With the recovery and correlation of these documents, we can hope to establish at least what happened in Dresden and when, thus providing a chronological framework for the origins of modern painting in Germany. Yet chronology is but a means to the end of understanding the history of style-that total context in which creative acts are performed.r Style does not arise outside of historical con- text even though, in the appraisal of much twentieth century art, "originality" is placed at so high a premium that roots in the art of the past, when not immediately obvious, are some- times ignored. Particularly in a period of such rapid change as the 1905-1914 decade (when "the past" meant often "last year" or even "last month"), style and dating are inextricably interrelated in a web of linked derivations, of pictorial sources and their (often unexpected) sequels. So it was in Kirchner's early development. It can now be shown that Kirchner pos- sessed a retentive pictorial memory, which allowed him to incorporate into his own work motifs from other art seen a few weeks or months previously. These derivations, first of all, are useful for the establishment of a reliable chronology. We will be able to date the derivative Kirchner works (at least with termini post) whenever we can determine the time when their models were first seen. But the derivations, significantly, are only partial. In no case before the last year in Dresden do we find real copies, in the sense that the earlier source is adopted entire. Instead we find translations, where borrowed themes and compositional ideas comprise but the initial stimuli for works painted in an increasingly personal language. Kirchner's relation to earlier art, in sum, was not unoriginal; in gradually transcending his sources, he used them as vehicles for the at- tainment of personal style. During his lifetime, however, Kirchner did not admit de- pendence upon earlier non-German art. Following a period of severe mental illness and prolonged hospitalization during World War I, he was, in fact, directly or indirectly responsible NB A bibliography of frequently cited sources, given in short form in the footnotes, will be found at the end of this article. I The writer's preliminary research, including study of the Kirchner Estate in Basel (September, 1953) and in Biberach/Riss (January, 1954) and six interviews with Professors Heckel, Schmidt-Rottluff and Pechstein between January and July, 1954, was supported by a Fulbright student grant in that academic year. The result was a doctoral dissertation on Kirchner's early chronology and graphic development. A Fulbright research grant (1964-65) made possible the conclusion of the present study, which in turn is conceived in support of a catalogue raisonn6 of Kirchner's paintings, currently nearing completion. Appreciation is here expressed for a Dick- inson College faculty research grant and for advice and comments received, during the study's long gestation, from Charles Kuhn, Sydney Freedberg and Mark Ros- kill, Harvard University. 2 On the basis of unpublished Kirchner letters H. Bolliger published a biographical outline in 1960, slightly modifying and expanding an earlier chronology published in 1950 and 1952 (see Bibliography). In 1956 and 1961 respectively, L.-G. Buchheim and Dr. H. Wentzel published portions of interviews with Fritz Bleyl. Also in 1956 the first doctoral dissertation devoted to Kirchner was completed by Dr. A. Dube-Heynig (nee Heynig), who drew upon interviews with Erich Heckel and other eyewitnesses; her book in 1961 was on Kirchner's graphic development, anticipat- ing the forthcoming publication of a revised graphic catalogue raisonne. Newly assembled Bricke announcements, portfolios and exhibition documents enabled Dr. M. Urban to publish a documented Briicke chronology in 1957, expanded in 1958. In 1957 Dr. G. Wietek compiled information on the Briicke artists' summer activi- ties; he published and exhibited in 1958 and 1962 drawing-postcards and other cor- respondence from the later Briicke years. In 1960 the organizers of the 377-item Kirchner retrospective exhibition in Diisseldorf first catalogued works without re- gard for dates provided by the artist: a precedent sometimes followed in more recent exhibitions elsewhere. Also in 1960 Dr. E. Roters first published a Dresden newspaper review of an early Briicke exhibition, that of 1907. Dr. G. Kriiger in 1965 began publication of materials from the Max Pechstein and Paul Fechter es- tates. 3 Following the death of Kirchner (in 1938) and of his common-law wife (in 1945), the Estate entered the custody of the Basel Art Museum, pending the conclusion of international reparations agreements. During the 1953-54 winter the Estate en- tered the possession of the late Walter Kirchner and other heirs, in Biberach/Riss, Germany. Reparations payments required the forced sale of a portion of the Estate, primarily through the Stuttgarter Kunstkabinett, beginning in 1954. As agent for the Kirchner heirs, Roman Norbert Ketterer has, since the middle 1950's, succeeded in reassembling many documents, photographs and photograph albums dispersed in the years since 1938; as supplemented by materials retained in the Estate, these documents comprise the Kirchner Archive, located in Campione bei Lugano. The cooperation of Mr. Ketterer and of Mr. Wenzel Nachbaur, primarily responsible for the exhaustiveness of the Archive, is hereby gratefully acknowledged. 4 Permission for scholars to enter the German Democratic Republic can sometimes be secured upon personal invitation, following proper application to governmental authorities; such permission is granted infrequently to citizens of the German Fed- eral Republic, and not at all to persons who formerly resided in the eastern terri- tory. The process of application requires two months, if successful. For their as- sistance in facilitating my visit to Dresden in January, 1965, I am indebted to Dr. I. Stolzenberg, Berlin, and the Drs. W. Schmidt and A. Deckert, Dresden. 5 J.

An impression of Kirchner's color woodcut, Still Life with Flowers and Pitcher, in the Kestner-Museum in Hanover, is signed and dated "07" and was included in a port- folio sent to Briicke "passive members" early in 1908; but the print is dated in the 1898-1902 period in the graphic catalogue authorized by the artist in 1926.7 The oil painting Czardas Dancers in the Community Museum, The Hague, was illus- trated in a monograph upon which the artist collaborated and was there dated "1905"; the painting is today signed (in black paint) and dated "07" (in blue paint); but the same work is given the date "1908" by the artist in one of his personal pho- tograph albums now in the Kirchner Archive.8 Or, finally, we may point to stylistically dissimilar paintings both carrying the same dates, such as Lake in Dresden Park, in the Teltsch col- lection, London (Fig. 1) and Girl under Japanese Umbrella, State Art Collection, Diisseldorf (Fig. 2). Even the most cur- sory analysis reveals a stylistic discrepancy so vast as to pre- clude any possibility that both works were executed in the same year of 1906; one depends upon Neo-impressionist color divisionism and an impasto streaklike stroke akin to Van Gogh's, while the other displays a drastically flattened space and sketchlike application of pure hues not unlike Matisse's Fauve manner. One or the other of these dated works is clearly misdated, but there has heretofore been no way to determine whether the Girl was executed later than its date indicates or, as has been suggested,' whether the Lake was painted earlier. Upon this question might depend, for example, whether Kirch- ner's Fauve-like style occurred later than Matisse's or whether it was essentially contemporary. In order to distinguish the reliable date from the erroneous one, it is necessary to examine the difference between the signatures of the two works. The signature type of the Lake (Fig. 4) embodies some vestiges of the deutsche Schrift, tradi- tionally taught in German elementary schools until relatively recently. Particularly the initial "E" is formed as in this script: a long vertical curling below the level of the other letters, and a separate short stroke used for the horizontal cross-bar. The signature of the Girl (Fig. 5) is entirely in Lateinschrift,lo with the one-stroke initial "E" placed on the same level as the suc- ceeding letters. Both signatures are authentically those of the artist. But an extensive examination of the vast majority of original works from Kirchner's Dresden oeuvre reveals the salient fact that the deutsche Schrift initial "E" is found on no work dated by the artist after 1910. Further, a study of dated Kirchner letters and postcards written between 1909 and 1912 proves that the signature change from deutsche Schrift to Lateinschrift initial "E" occurred suddenly between late July and early September, 1910.11 The conclusion is inescapable that the signature (and with it of course the date) presently on the Diisseldorf painting were actually added by the artist at some time after mid-1910. How long after? An answer is provided by the fact that Kirchner took a photograph of the Girl before the signature and date were applied (Fig. 3). The photograph depicting the Girl in its original state, like dozens of similar photographs in the artist's estate, was taken early in the period of Kirchner's Swiss residence, demonstrably in 1920 or later.12 Thus the sig- nature and date now on the Diisseldorf painting were applied more than a decade after the time of the work's execution, for this reason alone casting doubt on the date's accuracy. Stylistic evidence to support a later date for this painting will be con- sidered in an appropriate place below. The fact that Kirchner's photographs reveal dozens of cases where a painting's present paint surface differs from that of an earlier state, as in the comparison between Figures 2 and 3 for the Diisseldorf Girl, 1 presents an unique opportunity for doc- umenting an artist's methods of reworking earlier composi- tions in later years. This aspect of Kirchner's art, however, must remain beyond the scope of the present discussion. Generalizing the conclusions drawn from this investigation, it is clear that works whose dates are simultaneously applied with a signature characterized by a deutsche Schrift initial "E" are the only ones whose dates may be considered reliable for the purpose of chronological documentation. Not only may we therefore accept the Lake's date of 1906 as being reliable, we may also consider all other such works as representing the only reliably dated works in the Dresden oeuvre available to us today. Their number is extremely small, as is only to be ex- pected."4 From a Dresden production encompassing more than 250 oils, over 450 graphic works (most in numerous impres- sions) and well over two thousand drawings, a fairly exhaus- tive study reveals only thirty-six works whose dates satisfy 6 (Catalogue) Diisseldorf, 1960, passim; see note 2 above. There is no evidence that Kirchner misdated works prior to his wartime illness. On the contrary his un- published correspondence shows that his earliest "cataloguing" of his prior works occurred during his severest mental crisis, during the 1917-18 winter, and implies that both illness and misdating were related to a war-induced persecution complex. It should be noted, in this regard, that in Berlin from 1910 onwards (beginning with Pechstein's leadership of the Neue Secession) contemporary critics without exception minimized Kirchner's art while extolling Pechstein's. By 1914 the two leaders of German expressionism were considered to be Kandinsky and, not Kirch- ner, but Pechstein: see Fechter, 1914, 24-28. 7 Schiefler, 1926, woodcut number 43. As is customary, catalogue indications for Kirchner graphic works cited below (i.e., Sch. 43) refer to this publication. The fact that Kirchner was alone responsible for the catalogue dates is verified in Schiefler, 1927, 62. 8 Grohmann, 1926, pl. 56. Kirchner's responsibility for dates proposed in this book is attested by Prof. Grohmann, Berlin, in interviews in January, 1954 and March, 1965, and corroborated by unpublished Kirchner letters from 1924 through 1926 kindly placed at my disposal by him. 9 Grohmann, 1961, 34; Urban, 1964, 36. 10 For illustrations of the two scripts, see Der grosse Brockhaus, 16th ed., Wiesbaden, 1956, x, 477. 11 According to postcards in the Altonaer Museum, Hamburg, the deutsche Schrift "E" is used for Kirchner's signature without exception through June 30, 1910. The first postcards with Lateinschrift signature are postmarked September 18 and</page><page sequence="3">KIRCHNER IN DRESDEN 337 our requirements. As listed elsewhere (see Appendix I), the thirty-six include no oil paintings from before 1905, from 1907, or from after 1909; no drawings, etchings or lithographs from before 1908; and no woodcuts after the latter year. Nevertheless the small corpus of works reliably dated by the artist between 1905 and 1910 must support, and in turn be supported by, any Kirchner chronology proposed for the Dres- den period. The new documentation, in part recently discov- ered in Dresden and here published for the first time, appears to answer these needs. Pre-Briicke Apprenticeship In the years just preceding the founding of the Briicke, the city of Dresden was, after Berlin and Munich, one of the leading artistic centers of Germany. Feuilletonists in the Dresden daily newspapers regularly devoted prominent coverage to major (as well as trivial) cultural news from their own city, as well as from the national, Bavarian and Austrian capitals; Dresden art news was in turn reported by monthly art magazines in Berlin, Munich and Leipzig. The art collections in Dresden had for centuries been under royal patronage and were to remain so until 1918; the exhibition of more contemporary art was spe- cifically entrusted to the "Court Art Dealer" who during the early twentieth century was Ludwig Gutbier. Gutbier directed the Ernst Arnold Art Salon in the Old Market (beginning in November, 1906, in new quarters on Schloss Strasse, renamed Arnold Gallery) which, through its links to the Saxon nobility, was the center for Dresden's more traditional and conservative art life. Although the city witnessed no organized Secessionist movement among younger artists, it did support two addi- tional showplaces for modern art: the Saxon Art Association and the Emil Richter Salon. The Art Association, located near the Royal Palace on the Briihlesche Terrasse overlooking the Elbe, provided an enlightened forum for the exhibition of the work of selected contemporary artists of local, national or in- ternational prominence. Although not equipped for very large exhibitions and quite often limiting itself to the showing of graphic art, the Art Association nevertheless conducted an active purchase policy in support of its program. The Richter Salon, on the other hand, was a private enterprise. Its art exhi- bition rooms on the fashionable Prager Strasse were but an adjunct to its primary quarters, which were devoted to the sale of men's and women's clothing. Richter's willingness to display the most radical of modern and contemporary trends fulfilled a necessary function in the Dresden art world. Into this environment the Briicke was born. The circum- stances surrounding the group's formation have often been described but never documented, nor has the existence of the name "Briicke" been recorded before early February, 1906.15 But it is now generally accepted that the group was formally named in the latter half of 1905, following Kirchner's comple- tion of eight semesters' architecture study at the Dresden Technische Hochschule. All four founders were in fact stu- dents or recent graduates of architecture: Fritz Bleyl and Kirchner, both born in 1880, earned their degrees of Diplom- Architekt on July 1, 1905; the considerably younger Erich Heckel and Karl Schmidt, born in 1883 and 1884 respectively, gave up their schooling after only a few semesters at the Technische Hochschule. The double role of Hochschule Pro- fessor Fritz Schumacher in fostering both the professional and creative training of the young student-artists is of special sig- nificance."' Although it was the youthful Schmidt who pro- vided the name "Briicke," it was the twenty-five-year-old Kirchner who at the outset exercised primary leadership. Not only was Bleyl already pursuing that nascent architectural career which eventually led to his formal withdrawal from the group (in 1908), but Kirchner was the only one who had had the benefit of new stimuli and an extended period of study out- side of Dresden: specifically in Munich in 1903-1904.17 Although the exact nature of Kirchner's artistic apprentice- ship before the founding of the Briicke remains to be estab- lished, one widely published document may be singled out here for its chronological significance. This is a caricature-head woodcut, mailed as a postcard to Bleyl from Munich on March 18, 1904, and carrying the message: "Dear Fritz, Sending you with my first original woodcut the best regards. / Your friend Ernst."s18 Not only does this message invalidate the dating of the first hundred-odd woodcuts listed in the Schiefler graphic catalogue, but it underlines how late Kirchner's graphic debut actually was when compared, for example, with the initial work in painting by such exact contemporaries in Paris as Picasso and Derain. Kirchner's artistic production, before the founding of the Briicke, was composed primarily of woodcuts (apparently lino- leum-cuts in some cases) and drawings. His earliest woodcut figure compositions were patterned after the general graphic 20, 1910. The initial "E" in the latter script is occasionally used earlier in 1910 in addressing Erich Heckel; reversion to the former script does occur, but ex- tremely infrequently, after 1910 (cf. note 148 below). 12 Examination of Fig. 3 shows the undated painting to be placed on an easel in front of a large scale triangular-patterned composition visible below. The latter is a theater design created by Kirchner for the Davos town theater in March, 1920, illustrated in Kornfeld, 1964, p. 15. Other photographs of undated and earlier states of Kirchner paintings include in their backgrounds details of "Die Lairchen," a cabin on the Wildboden mountains above Frauenkirch, where Kirchner lived from late 1918 through mid-1923. 13 The general method of retouching or repainting earlier canvases is typified by this comparison. Compositional changes are few and minor (cf. the lower hand), but many individual areas of the surface including some contours have been reworked, sometimes in different colors. Due to differences of color sensitivity in the earlier negatives, pinks and reds print considerably darker so that caution must be exer- cised in photographic evaluation. 14 Signatures, as signs of personal creation, were alien to the original spirit of the Bricke as a "community"; see esp. Arntz, 1948, 7. Exhibited works were some- times signed but even these were rarely dated at that time. 15 Cf. Nolde, 1934, 90f. 16 Schumacher, 1932, 7ff; cf. Heynig, 1956, 39-45. 17 Heynig, 1956, 14-22; Roters, 1960, 185f. 18 Buchheim, 1956, fig. 16, p. 39; Urban, 1957, Cat. No. 118, p. 18; and later sources.</page><page sequence="4">338 The Art Bulletin conception of Felix Valotton. The Swiss-born Valotton, exhib- iting during the 1890's with the Paris Nabi group, utilized the decorative and graphic possibilities of the woodcut medium to organize closed white and black shapes into firmly structured two-dimensional compositions. Probably as early as 1904 Kirchner recalled Valotton's famous woodcut of 1896, Laziness (Fig. 6), published by Meier-Graife in 1898,19 when he exe- cuted a variant entitled Nude on Patterned Bed-Cover, not catalogued by Schiefler (Fig. 7). Valotton's richly variegated patterning of the quilt fabric is not matched by Kirchner's more mechanically repetitive bed-cover design, but the use of strong diagonals and the off-center placement of the nudes are identical in both prints-with the thick black frame inter- secting the feet of Valotton's nude, and the head of Kirchner's. The sinuous rhythms used by Kirchner in outlining the figure create that same fin-de-siecle air of sensuous self-indulgence that is expressed in this Valotton work. Another comparison reveals Kirchner's early comprehension of both the strengths and the limitations of Valotton's graphic style. In a woodcut from about 1900, In the Library (Fig. 8), Valotton masses shadows and integrates the dark background with firm figure- and picture-contours; Kirchner does the same in Girl with Candle on the Stairs, Sch. 4 (Fig. 9). Shadows cast by a central light source form the major focus of interest in both prints; similarities in the treatment of the extended arm and hand, as well as in the use of monogram initials, are also evident. But in place of the static and descriptive Valotton composition Kirch- ner has boldly insisted upon curves and diagonals, even at the expense of a representationally convincing figure-stair spatial relationship. The Kirchner print is one of the more original of his early graphic compositions and, for this reason, should probably be dated in 1905, rather than in 1904.20 The number of oil paintings completed by Kirchner before the end of 1905 can not have been great. Six are extant and a few others are known from photographs or descriptions; they are modest in scale and do not yet reveal a single stylistic di- rection.21 This makes more understandable the curious fact that, in spite of the Briicke's founding in late 1905, the first public exhibition of its work did not occur until a year later. One must assume that the group's production in 1905 (espe- cially in oil painting) still was insufficient to warrant exhibi- tion. Graphic works on the other hand were exhibited at the Saxon Art Association by the future Briicke artists, as indi- viduals, beginning as early as June, 1905. In that month the Association purchased a print by Schmidt entitled Afternoon Sun; in July Bleyl showed five woodcuts, including Elbe Skiff; and in October Heckel, Kirchner and Schmidt were all in- cluded in the Association's autumn graphic exhibition.22 Early Briicke Development Two signal events occurring during the late fall and winter months of 1905-1906 were important to the eventual creation of Kirchner's early Briicke style. The first was a comprehensive exhibition of fifty paintings by Vincent Van Gogh in Novem- ber, 1905, the earliest on this scale ever to be held in Dresden.23 In February, 1906 it was Edvard Munch's paintings that were shown in Dresden, albeit in more modest numbers. But though the influence of these previously undocumented exhibitions was demonstrably direct, Kirchner's style in 1906 remained only partially inspired by these post-Impressionist sources. Although Van Gogh's letters had been translated into Ger- man during the previous twelve months, the Dresden public was clearly unprepared for the "wild man's" paintings as ex- hibited at the Ernst Arnold Salon in November, 1905. While noting that Hugo von Tschudi "had already reserved a few of the paintings as a beginning for the Berlin National Gallery," a newspaper reviewer took strong exception to an introductory statement accompanying the exhibition-list: "... one can read that Gogh [sic] has created masterpieces, by which the author really means that a few of his color-orgies already proclaim insanity. He judges other pictures as completely classic.... A great many visitors to the exhibition are of the opposing opin- ion . . . in that they reject the complete Gogh with laughs or with indignation.... A great talent, which developed along a single side, but which did not come to maturity."24 Since the exhibition list has not survived and no published 19 Meier-Grife, 1898, pl. 83. 20 Arntz, 1948, 12, was the first to postulate a Kirchner dependence upon Valotton graphic art; Heynig, 1956, 89f., relates Sch. 4 to the general Valotton style, but dates the print 1903-04. Heckel (interview April 25, 1954) estimates "end 1904 to 1905" for its date. 21 According to Heckel (interview, April 25, 1954), the first Kirchner painting he saw following their original meeting around Easter, 1904, represented a girl bathing in a pond and was executed in a "sentimental realism." This work may be similar to a drawing depicted in a Kirchner photograph; also visible in the photograph are two lost landscapes (one in oil, the other probably in charcoal), and a head-and- shoulders oil portrait of a long-haired maiden, the latter in oval format. This last is in turn closely related to a lost "Water-Nymph" described by Bleyl: cf. Wentzel, 1961, 24. The extant oil paintings in approximate order of execution are as follows: Male Portrait in Profile, 25 x 21.5cm; Valley near Lichtenwalde, 19 x 27cm; Seated Nude Seen from the Back, 45 x 56cm; Woman Embroidering, 25 x 36cm; Female Nude with Foliage Shadows, 37 x 30cm; Erich Hecket and Model in the Studio, 50 x 33.6cm. The second and fourth are located in the Julie Kirchner collection in Biberach; the last is reliably dated "05" (see Appendix I), and is in a Bern private collection; the others are in the Kirchner Estate. Of the several different stylistic directions evident in these paintings, Art Nouveau influences are strongest in Seated Nude while the stimulus of the Nabi school is most marked in Woman Embroidering; although later somewhat reworked, the latter painting is dependent in both style and technique upon such Valotton paintings as the Woman Writing at Her Desk of 1904, illustrated in Jourdain, 1953, pl. 34. 22 Dresdener neueste Nachrichten, 151 (June 6), 1905; 191 (July 16), 1905; 205 (July 30), 1905; 282 (October 15), 1905. 23 A statement written in 1934 to the effect that "almost thirty pictures" by Van Gogh were exhibited at Arnold's in 1904 has not yet been verified.

The partial</page><page sequence="5">KIRCHNER IN DRESDEN 339 catalogue is known, the attempt to identify the exhibited paint- ings must proceed along other lines. Of the fifty paintings, eight are mentioned (not all by exact title) by the reviewers for the Dresdener neueste Nachrichten and the Dresdener Anzeiger. These eight, in turn, can all be identified with paint- ings among the forty-five exhibited two months later at the Miethke Gallery in Vienna-a Van Gogh exhibition for which a published catalogue does exist. We may assume therefore that the Miethke catalogue reflects the contents of the Richter show.25 Fourteen Miethke titles may be more or less precisely identified with specific Van Gogh paintings from Provence or Auvers, while twelve additional titles are clear enough to spec- ify Van Gogh themes treated in several variations.26 In particular the Miethke catalogue lists two "Landscapes," a Sunset on the Rhone and a painting entitled Couple at the Edge of the Forest. The latter can only be identified with De la Faille 485, the Lovers, of 1888 (Fig. 10). One or several of the other pictures may well have depicted a sun- or moonlit sky, illustrating Van Gogh's typical method of encircling heavenly objects with concentrically arranged brushstrokes. If there is any doubt about the presence of such paintings in the Dresden exhibition, it is dispelled by a Kirchner oil paint- ing: Moonrise; Soldier and Girl in the Kirchner Estate (Fig. II). Not only is the stance of the male figure in the Van Gogh Lovers adopted by Kirchner, but the content of the two works is identical-presenting the human couple as the focus of an only superficially domesticated, essentially animistic, natural environment. In the German work, even more than in the Van Gogh prototype, a late romantic symbolism (stressing the lov- ers' role in unspoiled nature) takes precedence over any dy- namic urgency of expression. In his first responses to the Van Gogh brushstroke and to the Van Gogh palette Kirchner was able to master the technical requirements of impasto work in oils only partially. The almost excessively laden curvilinear strokes in foliage and fence give way to longer streaks of con- siderably thinner pigment elsewhere in the composition. Al- though both paintings employ blues with accessory reds for the figures, greens for the trees and pinks for the sky, Kirch- ner exaggerates the hue contrasts still further by employing purple (with red streaks) in the ground plane, intense ultra- marine and violet in the right-hand trees, and a full gamut of hues in the sky-including pinks and blues, and an orange aureole around the yellow moon. This blatancy in color and the vestiges of Art Nouveau pattern in the central tree still be- tray the relative awkwardness of the apprentice painter; nevertheless the Moonrise painting is the first tentative link in Germany between twentieth and nineteenth century ex- pressionism. The terminus post for the Kirchner painting, in short, is November, 1905-invalidating the "03" date (in blue crayon) entered below the deutsche Schrift signature (in ink) on the canvas at the lower right. Whether or not Moonrise was actually executed during the last months of 1905, as seems most likely,27 the painting marks the introduction of the impasto brushstroke into Kirchner's painting style. Though Munch's work was generally better known than Van Gogh's in Germany at this time, a Munch painting exhi- bition in Dresden was a rare experience for the younger gen- eration. The show of twenty works by the Norwegian artist was displayed at the Saxon Art Association in late February, 1906, and was reviewed by both daily newspapers. Twelve paintings and one pastel were specifically mentioned by the reviewers, of which nine are readily indentifiable.28 Mention was made of at least two different oils depicting women dressed in blue: these are most probably identical with Munch's Portrait of Inger of 1892 (Oslo, National Gallery) and his Girl with Long Hair of about 1904 (Oslo, Klaveness collection). Most specifically described is a picture contrasting "the still dark water on the left with the lively movement in the group of various ladies in brightly colored summer dresses on the right." Of the numerous variations on this Munch theme,29 it is almost certainly the Young Women on the Bridge from 1903, now in the Bergen Picture Gallery (Fig. 12), which was on exhibition. For Kirchner neither the mood nor the dark and light pattern in the latter picture was of interest.

Oils of 1906 (cf. Figs. 14, 1) already use only the elongated stroke in strongly structured compositions, which give way in 1907 (cf. Fig. 16) to more rhythmical strokes more freely composed. 28 R[ichard] S[tiller], "Slichsischer Kunstverein," Dresdener Anzeiger, 53 (February 24), 1906, 4; cf. also P[aul] F[echter], "Im Sichsischen Kunstverein," Dresdener neueste Nachrichten, 51 (February 23), 1906, 2.

Other works men- tioned in the reviews are: "Das Bildnis des alten Mannes mit verschrtinkten Armen in dunkelblauem Rock und Hut"; "Das Miidchen am weissen Gartenzaun"; "Der weibliche Akt . . . plumpe Malweise"; and a pastel drawing, "Der schwarze Mann und das rothaarige Miidchen." 29 Cf. Revold, 1960, 49-66.</page><page sequence="6">340 The Art Bulletin (Fig. 13), he limited his attention to a specific compositional de- vice quite basic to Munch's style: the unification of figure- shapes from different spatial planes by an all-encompassing, oc- casionally multiple, contour. The Kirchner drypoint, one of the artist's earliest works in the medium, reassembles many of the components of the Munch picture into a less static composi- tion, while retaining the stress upon space-plane unification. Independently dated in 1906 by Heckel,30 the drypoint most probably originated within several months of the February ex- hibition. Another pictorial quality stressed in the Young Women on the Bridge, as well as in the portraits mentioned above, is the frontality in figure placement. In the typical Munch female portrait the figure is centered within an exaggeratedly vertical format, with the arms placed symmetrically and the face both dominating the composition and infusing the entire work with a peculiarly hypnotic psychological intensity. It is suffi- cient merely to illustrate Kirchner's Doris Standing from the Kirchner Estate (Fig. 14) to document the young Dresden artist's first direct reaction in painting to Munch's female por- trait type. The treatment of the head precisely reflects Munch's bold contouring, heightened emphasis upon the eye-pupils, and rigid centering of eyes, nose and mouth within the flat, pale and undifferentiated plane of the face. The dark blue and black dress silhouetted with multi-colored contours against a light background is also inspired by Munch, particularly the latter's Girl with Long Hair then on exhibition. The dating of Kirchner's Doris Standing within a few weeks or months of the February Munch exhibition is supported by one additional piece of evidence. Several woodcuts31 in a series entitled "The Model" display both the multiple contours and frontality of figure placement within an exaggeratedly vertical format which in combination can derive only from Munch's style. One of the prints from this series was reported sold in June, 1906, in a review of the Saxon Art Association spring exhibition.32 Since woodcuts by Kirchner, Bleyl and Schmidt had been displayed in the Art Association winter exhibition in January-February, 1906,33 the inference is that Kirchner sent only more recent works (including the "Model" print) to the June show, and that the Munch-influenced print must thus date between February and June, 1906. The Doris Standing is indisputably contemporary with the Munch-inspired prints of "The Model" series. On the other hand Doris Standing reveals qualities that are quite independent of Munch's influence. The Norwegian's typical compositional symmetry is here relieved by Kirchner's displacement of the head to the left, asymmetrically balanced against the rectangular pictures in the top background. And Kirchner's retention of a heavily impasto brushstroke contrasts strongly with the thinner and less differentiated paint sur- face typical of Munch's earlier style. The union of Munch's moody content with Van Gogh's spontaneous and colorful paint application was a prophetic step. But it was a marriage, as it happens, without immediate issue, for in other works of early 1906 Kirchner shows himself not yet able to enlarge upon the more expressive aspects of post-Impressionist art. In a color woodcut, Nude among Sunflowers (Sch. 25), the curvi- linear stylization of the genital area and the breast-length hair, as well as the compositional symmetry and frontality, all re- late the print to the more symbolic subjects in Munch's oeuvre: the print may for this reason date from the period immediately after the February Munch exhibition. But the colors chosen for the print, rich red, yellow, green and blue, contradict the somber mood of the subject and suggest an Art Nouveau orna- mental design as the immediate source. In oil paintings during the course of the middle months of 1906 Kirchner gradually evolved a stylistic approach to out- door subjects which stands midway between the optical objec- tivity of late Impressionism and the more expressive and sub- jective conception of Van Gogh. A beautifully realized painting culminating this evolution is the Lake in Dresden Park from 1906 (Fig. 1), by its subject datable in the late spring or summer months. Heretofore considered solely Neoimpres- sionist in style, the Lake displays a competent mastery of divisionist color theory through pastel pinks within the blue water, and through vermilion and blue strokes in the green and yellow grass areas foreground.34 But in the original the painting also shows its ultimate dependence upon Van Gogh 30 Interview April 25, 1954. 31 Particularly Nacktes Miidchen am Ofen (Sch. 16) and Stehender Mfidchenakt (Sch. 15). 32 Dresdener neueste Nachrichten, 165 (June 22), 1906, 2. 33 Dresdener neueste Nachrichten, 21 (January 24), 1906, 3; 31 (February 6), 1906, 2. Two woodcuts by Schmidt, "The Studio" and "The Country Road," were singled out for praise in this review. 34 For Kirchner's claim to have witnessed an exhibition of Neoimpressionist paint- ings during the winter of 1903-04, see Kirchner, "Die Arbeit E. L. Kirchners," in (catalogue) Bern, 1954-55, 9-10; Bolliger, 1950, 137; Urban, 1964, 36. 35 As a result of an unrecorded Dresden exhibition, Nolde (1867-1956) was offered Briicke membership on February 4, 1906 (cf. note 15 above). Amiet (born 1868) came to the Briicke's attention through an illustrated article in the February, 1906 issue of Kunst und Kiinstler magazine. A chance meeting in May, 1906 between Heckel and Pechstein (1881-1955) led to the latter's membership. For Nolde's in- debtedness to Van Gogh, whose work he saw in Paris in 1899-1900, see: Selz, 1963, 14; Urban, 1964, 53f. The nine Amiet paintings reproduced in Kunst und Kiinstler (5, 1906, 185-94) reveal a mature and somewhat dry synthesis of Van Gogh's Aries style with elements ultimately deriving from the Pont Aven school. Particularly Amiet's Landscape (p. 186) patterns heavily impasto strokes with a discipline Kirchner was briefly to attempt in his own paintings during the suc- ceeding months; cf. Roters, 1960, 207. Pechstein's earliest drawing style, based on that of his teacher Otto Gussman, shows affinities with the Van Gogh drawing manner; appreciation is expressed to Dr. Giinther Kriiger, Berlin, for this informa- tion. Pechstein's 1906 painting Still-Life with Winter Cherries reveals this affinity, as has been mentioned by Roters (1960, 180 n. 14).</page><page sequence="7">KIRCHNER IN DRESDEN 341 by the relative size, length and impasto of each stroke-and by the resultant refusal of the individual fully saturated hues to create that optical resolution which was the goal of Neoimpres- sionist aesthetics. In the end, however, the Kirchner work (like others from 1906) is late Impressionist, rather than expres- sionist, in content. Much the same can be said about other Briicke work during the group's first year, although the rapid expansion of Briicke membership during early 1906 to in- clude Emil Nolde, Cuno Amiet and Max Pechstein was in part due to a shared admiration for Van Gogh's art."3 The period from the summer of 1906 through the summer of 1907 was for Kirchner largely a period of assimilation and maturation rather than contacts with new sources. To the ex- tent that stimulation was provided from the outside, however, it was the work of Van Gogh which was the continuing chal- lenge for Kirchner, as well as for each of the other Briicke artists. Numerous moments and methods of possible contact with Van Gogh's art may be documented at about this time. Bleyl has recorded his recollection that large photographs of paint- ings by Van Gogh and other French post-Impressionists were displayed in one of the rooms of the Dresden International Arts and Crafts Exhibition in the summer of 1906. Another incident (not dated, but possibly also occurring in 1906) was recalled by Bleyl: "One day Kirchner brought along from some bookstore or other an illustrated volume by Meier-Graife on the modern French painters. We were enraptured."'6 It is quite probable that the book involved was Meier-Graife's Entwick- lungsgeschichte der modernen Kunst published in 1904, rather than his Impressionisten, first published in the summer of 1907.7 In addition, Pechstein has recalled seeing several Van Gogh paintings "secretly" with Kirchner, by bribing an at- tendant in the Arnold Salon storeroom: this must have oc- curred in late 1906 or early 1907.38 Other possibilities of con- tact with significant Van Gogh paintings outside of Dresden seem much less likely at this time."9 Van Gogh paintings were also included in the last presenta- tion held in the old quarters of the Ernst Arnold Salon during November, 1906, an exhibition misleadingly titled "Impres- sionists." In spite of the curious omissions of Toulouse-Lautrec and C6zanne, the show's only newspaper review, by Dr. Paul Fechter, cites every other leading artist of the French post-Im- pressionist generation and mentions forty-nine works of art, although hardly all by name. Included were Neoimpressionist paintings by Signac, Cross, Rysselberghe, Luce and Seurat (the latter with five oils and four drawings); works from the Nabi circle by Denis, Vuillard, Valotton and Bonnard; and one or two works each by Schuffenecker, Laprade, and such younger artists as Puy, Camoin and Valtat who were soon to be associated with the Fauve movement. Gauguin was repre- sented by seven works "from his early period" while six Van Gogh works were exhibited, of which four oils were specifi- cally named.40 One of the Van Gogh paintings cited in the review is to be identified with the White Orchard today in the Stedelijk Mu- seum, Amsterdam (Fig. 16).41 A lost Kirchner painting Fruit Trees displays, even in an unsatisfactory archive photograph by the artist (Fig. 15), direct dependence upon the Van Gogh prototype, particularly in the arching tree trunk and branches, but also in the diagonal orientation of the ground plane. This comparison is particularly revealing because the Kirchner painting can not have been executed before the spring of 1907 if done from nature: the paint application is more impetuous and the brushstrokes less structured here than in Lake in Dresden Park and other paintings from 1906. The comparison thus indicates that Kirchner's pictorial conception could be conditioned (even before a specific motif in nature) by a proto- type seen several months earlier. Two important Kirchner portraits display a similar de- pendence upon specific Van Gogh paintings. Probably from 1907 because of a brushstroke vocabulary freer than that found in reliably dated 1906 paintings, the portraits mark a continuing progress from a late Impressionist to a post-Impres- sionist style. Kirchner's first known Self-Portrait42 recalls Van Gogh's Portrait of the Artist (De la Faille 525), if one ignores the sun-hat in the former and the forehead in the latter. Al- though the Kirchner lacks the precision in draftsmanship of 36 Wentzel, 1961, 26, 24. 37 Kirchner's personal library contained the Entroicklungsgeschichte in both the first edition of 1904, and a later expanded edition; Bolliger, 1959, 43. 38 Interview June 9, 1954. Pechstein left for Rome in the fall of 1907. 39 For the question of the early availability of Van Gogh works in Germany, see Eckhardt, 1956, 107-12. The first Van Gogh painting acquired by a Dresden pri- vate collector, in May, 1906, was a minor still life (F. 235). Of the two Van Gogh oils in the collection of Count Harry Kessler, Weimar, during this decade (F. 781, F. 753), one was illustrated in Meier-Grlife's 1904 Entwoicklungsgeschichte. Al- though several Van Gogh paintings were in the possession of Karl Ernst Osthaus in Hagen as early as 1904 (F. 492, F. 619), with two Millet copies acquired before 1907 (F. 668, F. 684), it is likely that the contents of this geographically distant collection were unknown to the Briicke before Paul Fechter devoted to it a lengthy article in mid-1907; cf. Dresdener neueste Nachrichten, 170 (June 25), 1907, If. 40 Paul Fechter, "Die Impressionisten bei Arnold," Dresdener neueste Nachrichten, 305 (November 10), 1906, If. A catalogue to the exhibition is mentioned. Fechter mentions the "bekannte Arlesierin," which indicates that only this Van Gogh painting had previously been seen in Dresden (see note 26 above); others named are "Das Getreidefeld," "Daubignys stiller Garten," and "Der Olivenhain mit den lebendigen Btiumen." 41 The link from the "Olivenhain" title (see previous note) to the Amsterdam pic- ture (F. 403) is provided by the latter's illustration over the title "Bliahende Oliven" in Meier-Griife, 1910, 19. 42 Illustrated in Buchheim, 1956, fig. 156, and now in the Mrs. Robert Windfohr col- lection, Fort Worth.</page><page sequence="8">342 The Art Bulletin the Van Gogh, the treatment of eyes and ear and the overall placement of head and shoulders within the composition ap- pear to be derived from this source. The Portrait of Erich Heckel,43 where the subject faces to the right, suggests Kirch- ner's direct familiarity with Van Gogh's Portrait of the Artist Dedicated to Gauguin (De la Faille 476). Here the lozenge- shape formation of the eyes and the planar demarcation of the face through impasto strokes are quite similar, while the un- naturally arched canvas-edge depicted on the right side of the Kirchner work completes, with the aid of Heckel's bent arm, the circular compositional movement around the head which is the central device invented by Van Gogh in his portrait. More- over, Kirchner has transformed the twenty-four-year-old Heckel into an older, more daemonic personality, heightening the expressive intensity of subjective portraiture to a degree now approaching that of Van Gogh himself. The period between the summers of 1906 and 1907 was the only year-long period of day-to-day collaboration between all the Dresden members of the Briicke group. The contents of the first two Briicke exhibitions, held in late 1906, may there- fore have shown marked similarities among the works of dif- ferent artists: unfortunately no works can be documented for either the painting and drawing exhibition, opening in Sep- tember, or the woodcut exhibition which opened in December. Neither show was able to find a forum among the established art salons in the city. Instead both were displayed on the walls of a lamp-factory showroom located in a Dresden suburb.4 The lack of public interest in the Briicke as a group may well have prompted the individual artists to seek their own exhibition opportunities in the course of 1907. In June of that year Kirchner was able to display no less than four paint- ings at the Saxon Art Association in an exhibition heretofore completely unknown. Spanning the period from 1905 to early 1907, the exhibited Kirchner paintings may provision- ally be identified with extant works by the artist."4 During the summer of 1907 the Briicke group finally suc- ceeded in securing the agreement of the Richter Art Salon to exhibit its work. The exhibition opening was reported on Sun- day, September 1: "about thirty paintings and over sixty graphic works" were included by the four Dresden artists and by Bleyl (whose address is now given as Freiburg), Amiet, Nolde, and Axel Gallen (Helsinki).46 The only newspaper re- view was published by Dr. Paul Fechter on the front page of the September 10 edition of the Dresdener neueste Nach- richten. Fechter's critique, recently republished in full by Roters,4 first attempts to put the Briicke's work in proper perspective by comparing it with other secession movements, then points out that this is "already really more than secession. Above everything else one feels real terror when looking at the things. By comparison Van Gogh is an innocent Academy professor-and even Cuno Amiet, to whom one is by now after all accustomed, has an almost tame and bourgeois effect next to the true 'Briicke' people. A 'freedom of action' is reached here which is utterly incapable of being surpassed any more-and a colorfulness, the immediacy of which leaves one powerless ..." But Fechter then goes on to attack the al- legedly programmatic character of early Briicke art in general: "That is the first impression. When one looks more closely, then a remarkable result occurs. The programmatic 'immedi- acy' disappears more and more; in its place appears more and more clearly-theory. Instead of the academic manner of painting appears a (shall we say) modern one; one recipe is seized instead of another. But recipe remains recipe, whether it is called Anton Von Werner or Vincent Van Gogh. Total wildness is not the spontaneous means of expression of peo- ple who can't manage through acquired routine ... and, grop- ing and struggling, now seek new ways . . . ; it is instead a program, theory, as little matching immediacy as the regimen of the academician..." Fechter ends by characterizing much of the graphic work as "dilettantism," in that "French prototypes have had a devastating effect." More positively, Kirchner is credited with "definitely the finest talent of the group," and some individual paintings are selected for praise; unfortunately, none of the three Kirchner paintings named can today be iden- tified.48 Fechter's review of the September, 1907 Briicke exhibition 43 Illustrated in (catalogue) Diisseldorf, 1960, No. 1, and located in a private collec- tion, Bielefeld. 44 Dresdener neueste Nachrichten, 261 (September 26), 1906, 2; 328 (December 4), 1906, 2; cf. Roters, 1960, 173-76, 184ff. Roters' transcription of the December an- nouncement (p. 184) is inaccurate; not only is the street address of the lamp- factory given (Gr6belstrasse 17) but "E. Nolde" is named among the exhibitors, listed in alphabetical order (cf. Roters, 1960, 195). 45 Dresdener neueste Nachrichten, 157 (June 12), 1907, 1. "Stickerin" is the previously mentioned Woman Embroidering of 1905 (see note 21 above); "Im grossen Garten" is undoubtedly Bed of Flowers of early 1906, 49 x 69cm, now in a private collec- tion, Legnano; "Blumenpfliickerin" is most probably the contemporary Woman in Front of a Vase of Sunflowers, 70 x 50cm, Kirchner Estate; while "Aus Dresden" is probably Woman near a Birch Grove of the first half of 1907, 68 x 78cm, Thyssen collection, Lugano-Castagnola. It should be noted that in the summer of 1907 Heckel and Schmidt-Rotluff joined the Vereinigung nordwestdeutscher Kiinstler and, shortly later, became members of the newly founded Oldenburger Kunstler- bund. They participated in the opening exhibition of the Oldenburg group in Jan- uary, 1908 (Wietek 1957, 32). 46 Dresdener neueste Nachrichten, 239 (September 1), 1907, 2; Dresdener Anzeiger, 286 (September 1), 1907, 3. 47 Dresdener neueste Nachrichten, 247 (September 10), 1907, 1; Roters, 1960, 196-209. While Roters' gloss to Fechter's text is illuminating and well documented, dates cited for Kirchner works are to be questioned: the two Kirchner paintings illus- trated by Roters (his figs. 24 and 22) for example are stylistically datable in late 1908 and mid-1909, rather than in 1907. 48 "Greuliche zwei Friiuleins," "ein paar Georginen," and "Raucherin"; these may later have been destroyed by the artist. Other paintings mentioned are: (Schmidt- Rottluff) "kleiner Garten," "ein weisser Rosenstrauss" (the latter probably identi- cal with Stilleben mit Rosen und Karaffe of 1907; cf. Grohmann, 1956, 254); (Pech- stein) "griiner Akt"; (Amiet) "der bliihende Baum"; (Nolde) "Rosen vor der Tiir," "die italienischen Frauen." By Heckel "bei dem [in Fechter's view] van Gogh die schlimmsten Verheerungen angerichtet hat," no paintings are specifically mentioned. Among the exhibited graphic works Fechter identifies: (Amiet) "das Bauernhaus im Winter," "das Herrenportriit"; (Nolde) "Radierungen . . . die junge Frau"; (Kirchner) "mannliches Bildnis . . . griine Tine"; (Pechstein) "gut gezeichneter Akt." 49 Schmidt-Rottluff's Self-Portrait (Grohmann, 1956, 171) is the most related in style to self- and other portraits by Van Gogh. If the 1906 date is accurate on this and</page><page sequence="9">KIRCHNER IN DRESDEN 343 is perhaps too harsh in its charge that the young Dresden art- ists had reduced Van Gogh's art to a recipe or theory. It is true that links to Van Gogh's style can be found from 1906 on in works by Schmidt-Rottluff, Heckel and Pechstein.49 It is also true that Nolde, in withdrawing from the Briicke (apparently immediately after this exhibition), suggested that the Dresden artists "should not call themselves Briicke but Van Goghi- ana."50 But it must be remembered that for Dresden the impet- uous brushstroke and daring color of the Briicke painters was almost as much an unexpected novelty in 1907 as Van Gogh's art itself had been in 1905. In fact, Van Gogh was not the only source for the Briicke work. The similarities between Munch's art and Briicke prints and drawings from 1906-1907 went unnoticed by the reviewer."1 And in his all too prophetic warning against "the academy of the new" (this was 1907, after all), Fechter misdirected his fire at what was, essentially, a group of self-taught painters active then for no more than three or four years. Culmination of Post-Impressionist Phase The year between the September Briicke exhibitions of 1907 and 1908 saw a marked loosening of the artists' ties to one an- other and, simultaneously, major progress in each artist's in- dividual development. During the summer of 1907, Schmidt- Rottluff and Heckel had already spent several months in the environs of Dangast in northern Germany; they returned for progressively longer visits each year during the Dresden pe- riod.52 Pechstein left Dresden in the fall of 1907 for a trip to Italy culminating (during the winter) in an extended visit to France; upon his return to Germany in the middle of 1908, he was increasingly more active in Berlin than in Dresden. Dur- ing the summer of 1908 Kirchner left Dresden to visit the Baltic island of Fehmarn. Later in 1908 Heckel left for Italy, where he remained until June of 1909. Nevertheless Dresden remained the focus for Kirchner's activities during most of the 1907-1908 year and, in Dresden, exhibitions of the work of Gustav Klimt and of Van Gogh were the major events of the period. Kirchner's own personal development now reached a culminating stage: the barely disciplined exuberance of earlier years is gradually tempered by a greater sense of personal in- volvement with his subjects, creating a more consistent com- mitment to the expressive aspects of his art. In early October, 1907, the Saxon Art Association held an exhibition, "Modern Paintings from Private Collections," in which a major painting by Klimt was for the first time exhib- ited in Dresden, alongside single paintings by Degas and Cezanne, two still lifes by Van Gogh, two shore scenes by Signac and numerous other entries.3 Within the week a major loan exhibition of Viennese Art was installed in the Arnold Gallery, including a number of drawings and at least three paintings by Klimt.4 The Klimt works were characterized by a pronounced emphasis upon ornamental pattern (derived from Art Nouveau sources) and upon line functioning as curvi- linear arabesque. These traits are in turn most clearly dis- played in Kirchner's etching used as a Briicke membership card for the year 1908, probably executed at the end of 1907 (Fig. 17)."' Here the repetitive curvilinear floral pattern and the rhythmically undulating contours of the petals and the seated girl (as well as the symbolic integration of flower and female) are all elements to be found in Klimt's studies for the Stoclet Palace frieze and other works from the previous two to four years. Among Kirchner's oil paintings the Portrait of Hans Frisch, in the McNay Art Institute, San Antonio, invites the most direct comparison with Klimt's ornamental and expressive style. This masterful work displays a composi- tional web of intricately patterned flowing forms, many in colors of jewel-like brilliance, suggesting a highly subjective reformulation on Kirchner's part, during the 1907-1908 win- ter, of the more consciously structured Klimt style so recently encountered. The climactic moment of Van Gogh influence upon Kirch- ner's style (as well apparently as upon that of Schmidt-Rottluff and Heckel) was occasioned by the exhibition of one hundred Van Gogh paintings at the Richter Salon, opening on April 28, 1908. An exhibition of this magnitude, shown in other German cities in the course of the year, was itself instrumental in pre- other paintings, then Schmidt-Rottluff was initially more profoundly moved by Van Gogh's art than was Kirchner. Heckel's Seated Child of 1906 (Vogt, 1965, No. 1906/1), like Kirchner's reliably dated Child's Head of that year (see Appendix I), indirectly recalls Van Gogh's children's portraits, particularly from Auvers; but the theme was probably suggested by Amiet's Portrait of a Child, seen in reproduction in February (Kunst und Kiinstler, 5, 1906, 191). The affinity of a 1906 Pechstein painting with Van Gogh's style has been touched upon (see note 35 above); I am indebted to Mark Roskill for suggesting that, by 1908, Pechstein's Landscape (Os- born, 1922, 15) shows unmistakable inspiration from the rhythmically surging, ani- mated ground forms in such Van Gogh paintings as the Ravine (F. 661, 662). 50 Hans Fehr, Nolde, Cologne, 1957, 53, as quoted in Selz, 1963, 15. 51 Munch-Briicke parallels before 1908 extend to general similarities of woodcut technique-and occasionally of fin-de-si6cle mood-but not yet to the more specific thematic derivations encountered later.

We are here able to support Karlheinz Gabler's suggestion ("Die Aquarelle und Zeichnungen E. L. Kirchners," catalogue Diisseldorf, 1960, p. [1] that a series of rhythmically contoured Kirchner draw- ings of nudes embracing does indeed stem from Klimt drawings seen beginning in late 1907. The immediate source is not among those suggested by Gabler but, instead, comprises such Klimt drawings exhibited in Dresden in October as the one praised by Fechter: ". . . als feinstes Stiick zwei sich umschlingende Gestalten, auf Pergament gemalt. Das Raffinement letzter Kultur, das in diesem Blatt lebt, laisst sich nur sehen... ." 55 Membership cards, like the graphic portfolios, were normally sent to "passive members" at the outset of each year; Erich Heckel, interview, January 30, 1954.

In Dresden, for example, it produced a major confrontation between the two newspaper reviewers. While Richard Stiller warned against "enthusiasts" who were making Van Gogh "fashionable," and stated his own view that "Van Gogh's talent was partial; his will was stronger than his ability," Paul Fechter was chal- lenged to write one of the first sensitive analyses of Van Gogh's art to grace a German daily newspaper.r6 But Fechter saw fit not merely to praise Van Gogh, but also to defend him from his posthumous followers. Resuming a theme originated in his Briicke review of the previous year, Fechter warned that "although one can take a technique from Seurat, or a principle from Monet," with the work of Van Gogh "object, form, tech- nique are not divisible, without destroying the whole.... He who has eyes can see here what can be learned from Van Gogh and what not: that the forms, into which he poured his fiery soul, belong only to him.... But what his oeuvre teaches more positively is the old maxim: learn your craft; then follow your own path, not others';... go the way that you must, even if you perish thereby." Although in retrospect it is uncanny to what degree Kirchner's career ultimately followed the pattern here set forth by Fechter, the Dresden artist was not yet able to ignore Van Gogh's style so completely. One of the Van Gogh paintings included in the Richter show was View of the Sea at Saintes-Maries, De la Faille 417 (Fig. 18), embodying Van Gogh's first reaction to the Mediterranean in 1888. Sev- eral weeks after seeing this painting, when Kirchner first came to experience the open sea on his earliest journey to Fehmarn around June, 1908, the Dresden artist essentially recapitulated the French prototype in his oil painting, now lost, Fehmarn Coast (Fig. 19). This comparison, like that illustrating an ear- lier Kirchner derivation from Van Gogh (cf. Figs. 16, 15), documents a dependence occurring more or less unconsciously weeks or months after the initial stimulus, most probably without intervening drawings made directly from the source. But unlike the earlier derivations from Van Gogh the Fehmarn Coast painting, even in a poor photograph by the artist, shows that Kirchner heightened the expressive elements of his proto- type. Van Gogh's "small green, red and blue ships," which stood out for a reviewer in early May,"' were subordinated during the summer by Kirchner, who stressed a more dramatic perspective recession of the shore upward and to the right. Exhibitions of the Briicke artists' own work in late 1907 and 1908 can now be documented. In December of 1907 Kirchner and Heckel are mentioned among the exhibitors at the Art Association winter exhibition; the works involved were not named. In April of 1908 Kirchner alone was represented at the Association's spring exhibition with two works, one of which, Old Factory, can be identified with a reliably dated lithograph from that year (see Appendix I)."s And in the annual Briicke exhibition at the Richter Gallery in September, 1908, five Kirchner paintings are mentioned in the reviews, all identifiable today. Writing in the Dresdener Anzeiger, Stiller discusses Kirchner's work as follows: In three landscapes Kirchner turns out to be far more moderate than before. Especially the farmyard with its large half-timber house, and a small autumn landscape in yellow-greenish tones go together, despite all the wildly laid on, in part blazing, colors far removed from intelligible forms. In his village street in bright sunshine the much too heavy and agitated shadows are annoying. More weighing of tone values is urgently needed. He speaks in a loud, raw accent: euphony ought to tone it down finally. It is most difficult to see anything in his two largest pictures: The White Dress and the Two Women. Both revel in a bluntness of manner, which by no means yet implies strength and which expressly shuns formal beauty. A certain verve and good color effect at a distance, qualities here admittedly present, are not able to help eliminate these defects." Fechter's critique, in the Dresdener neueste Nachrichten, is briefer: One sees a few very fine landscapes by Kirchner-only the feeling for the meaning of spatial relationships is submerged in the stress on color. A perfect example of this is the white dress. One may imagine the nude beneath (especially the length of the legs), and its relationships to the whole and to the background figure. In addition the lower of the two women decidedly makes one a bit anxious, although in general the surface is handled more nicely and many an individual detail turns out well.6o Stiller's remarks are especially helpful in identifying the ex- hibited works. The first work mentioned is the first of our reliably dated 1908 paintings, Fehmarn Houses (see Appen- dix I). Trees in Autumn, 70 x 50cm, is in the Kirchner Estate: 56 R.S., "Die Van Gogh-Ausstellung bel Richter," Dresdener Anzeiger, 126 (May 7), 1908, 3f.; Paul Fechter, "Vincent van Gogh," Dresdener neueste Nachrichten, 118 (May 2), 1908, 1. A Frankfurter Zeitung review of this identical exhibition, as shown in the Frankfurter Kunstverein five weeks following its Dresden appearance, is reprinted in Eckhardt, 1956, 115-18. 57 Fechter (May 2), 1908, 1. 58 Dresdener neueste Nachrichten, 351 (December 25), 1907, 2; 113 (April 26), 1908, 2. The other work named in the latter review, "Drei Frauen," is probably the color woodcut (rather than the etching) by that title, reliably dated 1906 (cf. Hey- nig, 1956, 53). 59 R.S., "Emil Richters Kunstsalon," Dresdener Anzeiger, 260 (September 19), 1908, 3. 60 Paul Fechter, "Kunstsalon Richter," Dresdener neueste Nachrichten, 254 (Septem- ber 17), 1908, If. 61 For a color illustration of Trees in Autumn, see (catalogue) Campione, 1964, 15. Although the present colors correspond to those mentioned by Stiller, these are laid over an earlier paint layer in which smaller, more ordered, strokes are recog- nizable; the painting doubtless originated in autumn, 1906, even though a color crayon title on the verso reads "Bliume im Herbst (Fehmarn)." Today's state could well have originated in 1908 at Fehmarn or, in part, considerably later. Neither the Fehmarn Cabins nor the Aktgruppe II has yet been published; the latter is stylistically closest to the Woman in White, but was executed in the studio before the Fehmarn trip. Paintings by the other Dresden artists mentioned in the two</page><page sequence="11">KIRCHNER IN DRESDEN 345 it has been reworked at least once, possibly even before this exhibition. The third landscape is most probably Fehmarn Cabins, 70 x 75cm, now lost. The "White Dress" is the reliably dated Portrait of a Woman in White, to be discussed below (Fig. 20). The "Two Women" (thanks to Fechter's use of the word "lower") can only be Nude Group II, 195 x 95cm, pres- ently forming the verso to a triptych side panel in the Kirchner Estate."1 If for the moment one ignores the academic frame of critical reference in the two eyewitness accounts ("tone values," "for- mal beauty," "spatial relationships"), one sees a grudging recognition of the emerging strengths of Kirchner's personal style. Concerning the 1908 Briicke exhibition as a whole the critics are similarly receptive. In spite of "the tempestuous new concert of color," Stiller implies praise through his com- ment that the current show displays "a certain moderation" when compared to that of 1907. Fechter, too, although com- plaining several times of hearing "the hinges squeak" and "the kettledrums roll" in front of individual paintings, finds the overall impression "more tranquil, calmer than last year." Fechter reserves his greatest praise for the work of Pechstein who, he notes, "has been in Paris." He sees, in general, "an evolution, an attempt to progress from a program to a form of expression." Kirchner's Fehmarn series marks the culmination of his early Briicke development. One of these paintings alone, the Portrait of a Woman in White, confirms how thoroughly Kirchner has mastered the expressive substance (not merely the manner) of Van Gogh's style, even though by now inde- pendent of any specific French source. The painting (Fig. 20), of which we reproduce a detail lower left showing signature, date and paint surface (Fig. 21) is reliably dated in 1908. Like Hans Frisch, Fehmarn Coast and other paintings from the end of 1907 through mid-1908, the Woman in White is created with such a lavishly impasto brush and palette-knife technique that one is aware more of unifying tactile and textured surface than of discrete strokes of the brush. The surface dynamism of pure color and boldly rhythmic contour (subsuming a spa- tial representation in which depth-recession is stressed) re- capitulates precisely the most subjective aspects of Van Gogh's late conception. It is important to stress Kirchner's debt in 1908 to the post- Impressionist master because, by this time, derivations from such earlier sources were being increasingly transformed in his personal style. Woman in White in fact displays an abstract pattern of vermilion-orange dots on the foreground beach which, although best traced to the ultimate influence of Klimt ornament the previous year, yet appears to function here as synesthetic equivalent for the brilliant heat of sun and sand (intimated through color and chiaroscuro elsewhere in the composition). Similarly, in the darkened figure of the seated youth in the upper right we may see a purposeful subservience of the male figure to the female, reminiscent of the theme of so many of Munch's figure compositions,62 but the U-shaped compositional relationship and the scale differential between the two figures are Kirchner's own innovation. In this and all other Fehmarn paintings from mid-1908, brush and palette- knife strokes are no longer patterned according to decorative principle or color theory but are instead completely fused, with both subtlety and daring, revealing an expressive intensity consistently rivalling that of much of Van Gogh's late oeuvre itself. New Sources in 1908-1909 In the second half of the year 1908 a most critical period of artistic transition began for Kirchner. The period of style- change was inaugurated by the stimulus of two events during the summer of that year. The first of these was a visit by Kirchner, indirectly capable of confirmation, to the 1908 exhi- bition of the Berliner Secession during the return journey from his summer visit to Fehmarn. Aside from certain pictorial evidence with which we shall be concerned here, the grounds for believing that Kirchner witnessed the Secession show are compelling.11 At the Berlin exhibition Kirchner was able to see the work of such Secession guests as Alfred Maurer and Oscar Moll (according to the catalogue, each represented by a still life), Kees Van Dongen ("Landscape," "Still Life") and Alfred Marquet ("Roofs," "Street Scene"). Even if he did not pay undue attention to these works in a show numbering 275 paintings and drawings, and even if (judging by Marquet's Street, reproduced in the catalogue) Kirchner found none of the paintings particularly radical, the contact with newer tend- encies originating in Paris was at least potentially of value. Of much more immediate significance, however, was the fact that the Secession exhibition gave Kirchner his first opportu- reviews of the 1908 Briicke exhibition are: (Pechstein) "Der Russe," "Kind be- gaffende Menschengruppe," "kleine Landschaften"; (Heckel) "Herbst im Park," "Landschaft mit den bliihenden Apfelbliumen" (for the latter see Vogt, 1956, No. 1907/1); (Schmidt-Rottluff) "das Gehift," "Windiger Tag," and "Um die Mittags- zeit" (the two latter are dated 1907 and 1908 respectively in Grohmann, 1956, 253f.). 62 The male figure, dark in tone and huddled into the shape of broad-based tri- angle recalls (among other possibilities) the left-hand figure in Munch's 1898 color woodcut, Women on the Seashore (Sch. 117). 63 The Briicke artists' participation in the annual Berliner Secession "Schwarz-Weiss" exhibition, opening in November, 1908 (see note 72 below) could only have been arranged through Pechstein, who undertook his first decorative commissions in Berlin beginning "im Sommer 1908"; Kriger, 1965, 87. Pechstein's introduction to the Berlin art world was effected by Hans Purrmann, during the former's stay in Paris during the early months of 1908. In a letter to the writer (dated November 7, 1964), Professor Purrmann confirms that Pechstein visited him in Paris. Purrmann in turn was an associate of the Berliner Secession, and was in direct contact with the Berlin dealer Paul Cassirer in early 1908; Barr, 1951, 108. Since Kirchner could have returned from Fehmarn only via Berlin (one had to change stations in Berlin for trains to Saxony), the assumption of a visit to the summer Secession exhibition by both Kirchner and Pechstein is circumstantially strong.</page><page sequence="12">346 The Art Bulletin nity to familiarize himself with the most recent paintings by Munch, four of which were displayed. In particular, the two Munch oils of 1907 illustrated in the catalogue, Lubeck Harbor and the Bergen version of the Portrait of Dr. Walter Rathe- nau,64 proved to have both long-range and immediate impor- tance in Kirchner's subsequent painting development. Munch's Lubeck Harbor (Fig. 22), now in the Zurich Art Museum, is a remarkably freely painted picture whose pro- gressive character lies in the powerful contrast created between pure reds, oranges, greens and blues in the buildings and back- ground on the one hand and, on the other, the broad, blunt shapes of the ships rendered in a flat black tone. The expres- sive value of black to set off a multi-hued composition was not lost on Kirchner; indeed one can with some certainty attribute to this specific stimulus the first return of black to Kirchner's regular painting palette in the fall of 1908, following its prior banishment"6 under Neoimpressionist and Van Gogh influ- ence. The long-range effect of this Munch source may be documented through a comparison with Kirchner's painting, Riverboat on the Elbe near Dresden, probably first conceived in 1910,66 in which both theme and palette approximate Munch's most closely. In the time intervening, several Kirch- ner prints and drawings return to the theme of the Munch painting. Of these the watercolor, River Steamboat, in Munich (Fig. 23), stylistically datable in later 1908 or in 1909,67 closely follows Munch's precedent in contrasting heavily outlined, irregularly curvilinear tree-shapes against rectilinear boat and architecture forms. The Rathenau (Fig. 24) in turn was certainly the source for the left-hand figure in Kirchner's painting now in Northamp- ton, Dodo and Her Brother (Fig. 25). The large area of black used for this figure's costume, the hand holding the cigar and, especially, the placement of the widely separated legs against a horizontal floor plane, with one leg and foot sharply fore- shortened, are elements which in combination can derive only from this specific Munch prototype. All available evidence suggests that the Northampton picture originated68 in Kirch- ner's studio during the last four or five months of 1908, shortly after the artist saw Munch's portrait in Berlin on the return journey from Fehmarn."9 Kirchner's first major street-scene, the Street painting in the Museum of Modern Art, New York, must also be dated in late 1908 for similar reasons.70 It is not known whether Kirchner saw examples of Munch's recent graphic art in Berlin in mid-1908, or whether these might have been regularly available in Dresden art galleries. But one reliably dated graphic work of 1908, the drypoint [Self-] Portrait Head with Pipe (see Appendix I), displays an unmistakable affinity to Munch's conception in both form and content, particularly in its frontality, its curvilinear contouring (especially of the hair), the stress on the eyes, and the intro- verted expression given to the lower face and mouth.71 Other graphic works by Kirchner from 1908, and by other Briicke artists shortly later, now appear to have been thematically influenced by the Norwegian's art. This would make under- standable a critic's characterization of Briicke graphic art, shown at the Berliner Secession graphic exhibition in Novem- ber, 1908, as the work of "remarkably related spirits who band together around Munch."72 For Kirchner's development, the second important event of the 1908 summer occurred in Dresden, in connection with the September exhibition of Briicke art discussed earlier. It was to lead to a new direction in his art. At the Briukcke's own exhi- bition significant examples of French Fauve art were displayed for the first time in eastern Germany. The reviewers refer to sixteen works, rarely by title, by such artists as Marquet and Van Dongen (each mentioned with two works) and Vlaminck, Puy, Guerin, and Friesz (each with one).73 Unfortunately none of the works touched upon can yet be identified with certainty; and since there would hardly have been an exhibition cata- logue, it is impossible even to determine what additional works were exhibited but not mentioned by the critics. Nevertheless the show's very existence"74 marks the long-sought missing link between the Paris and Dresden art worlds. 64 Katalog der fiinfzehnten Ausstellung der Berliner Secession, Berlin, Paul Cassirer, 1908, Nos. 181, 183; the other Munch titles are "Landschaft" (No. 180) and "Liibeck" (No. 182). The other version of the Rathenau is illustrated in (cata- logue) Berlin, 1927, opp. p. 26. 65 Large areas of black are last employed, among reliably dated paintings by Kirch- ner (see Appendix I), only in the Erich Heckel and Model in the Studio of 1905 (see note 21 above). 66 The painting, recently in a London private collection, is illustrated in Selz, 1957, pl. 146. An earlier state, without the foreground boatman, is reproduced in an Archive photograph. The angularity of certain forms relates it to Kirchner's style from the end of 1909 through mid-1910, to be discussed below (cf. p. 355). 67 River Steamboat, if done from nature as a spring or summer subject, can not be from 1908 (because of its fluid, sketchlike handling) nor from 1910 (because of its curvilinear rendering of background forms); if executed in the Dresden studio, it could date from the fall or winter of 1908 onwards. 68 An earlier state, showing minor changes, is depicted in an Archive photograph. 69 The subject of the Northampton picture, a relatively formal presentation of Dodo and a member of her family, also argues that this is one of the earliest represen- tations of Kirchner's new friend and model-the subject of his most famous Dres- den nudes from early 1909 on (cf. Figs. 2, 33, 36). Woman in White (Fig. 20) is the last known painting of Emmy Frisch, Kirchner's subject in fully clothed portraits in several media from the 1907-08 winter through mid-1908. 70 Although Gabler, "Die Gemiilde Ernest Ludwig Kirchners," (catalogue) Diisseldorf, 1960, p. [2], finds "in Munchs Werk bisher kein Bild" as prototype for the New York Street, Roters' discussion (1960, 204-06) of Munch sources of influence-par- ticularly Munch's Spring Evening in Karl-Johann Street of 1892-is sound. An earlier state of the New York painting, before its signature and "07" date were added, is reproduced in Grohmann, 1926, pl. 18. But because of its lack of impasto paint structure except for a few contours squeezed from the tube, the painting can not date from 1907 (cf. Roters, 1960, fig. 24; Grohmann, 1961, 34), nor from 1909-10 (catalogue Diisseldorf, 1960, No. 8). It is in fact transitional from the Fehmarn impasto style to more thinly painted early 1909 works (cf. discussion below, p. 350), as is also the Dodo and Her Brother. Moreover, the former painting is com- positionally intimately related to the latter, through the mirror-image translation</page><page sequence="13">KIRCHNER IN DRESDEN 347 Our only insight into the nature of the reception accorded French Fauve art in Dresden is indirectly provided in Fechter's review of the joint German-French show: A collection of works by young Frenchmen hangs in the next room. The encounter may be coincidence. It is in any event valuable-above all, for the Briicke. Not that the Briicke should, somehow, take these searchers for their model; yet a comparison of the problems here and there might upon reflec- tion show agreement in many respects. On the German side, first of all, strength (underlined three times), color and freedom (likewise) .... On the opposite side, a cautious search for new principles. A distinct departure from the analysis of light and atmosphere into all sorts of attempts at new syntheses. C6- zanne is in back of these works, as he is behind the emerging talents of the young Germany: Truebner and-slowly winning more and more influence-Marees. This should give one pause for thought. That every person has the right to demand uncon- ditional freedom of action as an artist, that he can paint what he will and as colorfully and energetically as he will, this is to be taken for granted by now, and is somewhat insufficient to serve as a goal for an artists' association. Here lies a danger for the Briicke: namely, to take a back seat, to dissipate their energies on things which when all is said and done are already settled. It is difficult to read these words without sensing a reflection of the views of Pechstein, the only Briicke artist for whom significant examples of Fauve art no longer came as a sur- prise.7" But Pechstein most probably did not see this show, since he was already in Berlin. And, surprisingly, neither Schmidt-Rottluff nor Heckel could have been in Dresden dur- ing September.7" Thus it apparently fell to Kirchner to arrange the details of the Briicke's own exhibition at Richter's and also to benefit from the inclusion of recent French work. This, it is now certain, he did. It is most probable that among the Van Dongen paintings shown at Richter's was Mistinguett and Max Dearly in the "Chaloupe'" Waltz, signed and dated "08" (Fig. 26). Certainly Kirchner's lithograph Dancer with Bent Back, Sch. 88 (Fig. 27), was taken directly from the Van Dongen work. Only the position of the arm has been modified, in order to integrate the single-figure composition more successfully. But the other similarities in the two works are so great that even the double- stroking of lines used for the dancer's back in Kirchner's version recalls the position of the male dancer's hand in Van Dongen's. In the lithograph, the combination of an emphasis upon pure outline with a lingering concern for black textural areas is characteristic of Kirchner's graphic style in transition from the highly textured surfaces in Fehmarn subjects of the 1908 summer to the almost wholly linear approach dominant in all phases of his work from 1909 on. It may also be shown that Marquet's ink drawing entitled Nude (Fig. 28) was among the works exhibited. Kirchner's oil painting, Nude in Tub Seen from Above, since lost (Fig. 29), was derived directly from the Marquet source. The similarity in vantage point and the identical treatment of hair and face, breasts and left leg, make the derivation clear." Yet Kirchner appears to have recognized the major weakness in the Marquet drawing-the bent left leg, unaccountably suspended in air- and to have eliminated its incongruity through the substitution of tub for chair. Although undated, it is likely that the Kirch- ner painting was executed before the end of 1908 because of its direct relationship to his lithograph, Girl in Bathtub, Sch. 96 (Fig. 30), the only one of the many reliably dated prints of 1908 to embody the Fauve "synthesis." The latter litho- graph, in turn, appears stylistically contemporary to the Van Dongen-inspired Dancer lithograph (Fig. 27). In sum, all evidence now available points to the Richter exhibition in September as the initial moment, and the Mar- quet and Van Dongen works as the immediate causes, for the most significant style-change thus far in Kirchner's Briicke development. Among the artists in Dresden it was Kirchner who initiated the Fauve phase of stylistic evolution. Fechter's warnings not to "take a back seat" and to avoid things "al- of the Northampton figures into the two major figures just to the right of center in the New York picture. 71 Several Kirchner 1908 woodcuts (cf. Portrat Alex and Kinderportrait K.H., Sch. 97 and 98) recall Munch's children's portraits in oil as well as the Norwegian's gen- eral woodcut technique after 1900. For thematic similarities between a Munch woodcut and a Kirchner drawing of 1908-09, and three Schmidt-Rottluff and Heckel woodcuts of 1909 and 1910, see Roters, 1961, 17-21. 72 Kunst und Kiinstler, 3 (December), 1908, 186. 73 For sources see notes 59 and 60 above. Other artists named are Denis, Roussel, Signac, Diriks, Camoin and Jourdain; more than one work by each of the last two artists is indicated, while the Roussel entry is given as a pastel. The titles cited are: (Marquet) "Hafenbildnis von St. Tropez," "die Prozession"; (Van Dongen) "Der Akt," "Die Zirkusdame"--which might possibly, even though mistakenly, refer to the Mistinguett discussed below (Fig. 26); (Puy) "Der Tote"; and (Friesz) "Strassenbild." 74 By one of those ironical sequences of events which fate reserves specifically for research scholars, Dr. Kriiger in Berlin years ago discovered a copy of the Dres- dener neueste Nachrichten review of the Dresden Fauve exhibition in a scrapbook in the Fechter Estate. Missing was only the date of the review (and thus of the exhibition itself)! Circumstances of political geography alone (see note 4 above) thus prevented his prior publication in full of this centrally important show; he must here be credited with its discovery and its first published mention (Kriiger, 1965, 94). 75 Cf. Kriiger, 1965, 94: "Sollte Pechstein bei dieser 'Kollektion junger franzb- sischer Kiinstler' die Hand im Spiele gehabt haben? Es wiire gut denkbar .. Pers8nliche Kontakte hatte Pechstein [in Paris] mit Kees van Dongen, den er auch im Anschluss an die Dresdener Ausstellung zu einer nur kurze Zeit dauernden Mitgliedschaft in der 'Briicke' bewegen konnte. Am 15.1.1909 meldete Heckel im einem Brief an Rosa Schapire den vollzogenen Beitritt van Dongens." Previously unrecorded in the Briicke literature is an exhibition of Van Dongen's work in the Flechtheim Gallery, Dusseldorf, in 1908 (catalogue Geneva, 1959, 6); geography precludes the likelihood that any Dresden artist witnessed this show. 76 Wietek, 1957, 33: both were in Dangastermoor from May until October, 1908. 77 Even though this Marquet drawing has been published as dating "vers 1912" in Jourdain, 1948, pl. 7.</page><page sequence="14">348 The Art Bulletin ready settled" and his suggestion that the Fauve works might be "valuable" for the Briicke constituted advice to which, in- evitably, Kirchner had to give heed. Heckel's and Schmidt- Rottluff's absence from Dresden explains the delay in the onset of their Fauve phases: they may not, even later on, have realized the significance of initial Fauve influences upon their friend's own work. Pechstein's interest in Fauve art, though anticipating Kirchner's by a matter of months, was to subside considerably beginning in 1909.1" For Kirchner 1909 was to be the year in which the Fauve style was not only mastered but carried to more radical extremes than in fact had ever occurred in France. Two exhibitions at the outset of the year 1909 were to in- crease Kirchner's awareness of recent French avant-garde art and to confirm the Fauve style as Kirchner's preferred mode of expression for the next several years. These are the first documentable occasions when Kirchner had the opportunity to see various aspects of the work executed in the previous four years by Henri Matisse. Concerning the Matisse works displayed at the Berliner Secession exhibition in the winter of 1908-1909, we know only that they were prints and draw- ings.79 But for the first one-man exhibition of Matisse's work in Germany, held in January at the Paul Cassirer Gallery in Berlin, we are fortunate to have several brief contemporary reviews, one of which mentions his "fine drawings of nudes."'-8 Another describes exhibited works from the Fauve period as: "... the portraits, . . . the paintings of nudes, . . . the 'decora- tive compositions'... [and] his bronzes ('each cast in 10 num- bered copies') which Matisse turns out as a side-line. ...."a81 It is possible to document Kirchner's presence in Berlin on Janu- ary 12, 1909. Almost certainly it was on this occasion that he saw both exhibitions.82 From the review it seems likely that the Matisse exhibition at Cassirer's included the bronze sculpture of 1907, Reclining Nude I (Fig. 31); less certain but also likely was the inclusion among the "paintings of the nudes" of Matisse's Blue Nude of early 1907 (Fig. 32), which "served as a study for the sculp- ture."83 Either or both of these works was the stimulus for certain aspects of the Kirchner lithograph Dodo Playing with Her Fingers, Sch. 93 (Fig. 33). Imagining the Kirchner print in mirror-image, as it was drawn on the stone, we see a reason- ably faithful outline drawing of the lower half of the Matisse nude. The position of the buttocks, legs and feet are quite similar to those of the sculpture (seen from a slightly higher vantage point than that illustrated here), or of the painting. The downward movement of the girl's waist reflected in the mirror, counteracting the pronounced upward thrust of the thigh, performs a compositional function in the Kirchner print similar to that of the palm-frond in the Matisse painting. We may thus relate the print to the stimulus of the Matisse exhibi- tion and consider January, 1909 as the terminus post for its dat- ing. Yet how different is Kirchner's approach from Matisse's! Granting that the hallmarks of the Fauve style are its two- dimensional rendering of form and its simplification, to the point of distortion, of shapes (for the moment ignoring the element of color), the Dodo is both flatter pictorially and far more distorted representationally than the Blue Nude. For veri- fication one has only to contrast the vertical expanse from top of buttocks to point of knee in Kirchner's composition, measuring twice as much as the interval from waist to chin, with the more properly foreshortened and proportioned upper leg in Matisse's painting. Matisse's Fauve style was requisite to Kirchner's, in sum, but from its first maturity in early 1909 Kirchner's Fauve style was clearly the more radical in dis- tortion. Kirchner's fascination with Matisse's anatomical distortions of the female figure was to endure for a considerable period after his original contact with the French sources. For example in a woodcut such as Nude Girl Reclining, Sch. 151 (probably originating in mid-1910 but first published in October, 1911), the position of the raised bent arm and the twisted head reflect the upper half of the Matisse sculpture. These same elements in the Blue Nude painting in turn serve as the model for another Kirchner woodcut from about 1910, Recumbent Nude Woman, Sch. 161 (Fig. 34);84 here the Matisse source is re- flected in the lower arm and hand as well. The similarities in facial features, especially the simplified form of the eyes, are striking. The crossed legs, spread buttocks and strongly arched spinal column of the Recumbent Nude Woman may be seen to derive ultimately from another Matisse source, the Seated Nude woodcut of early 1906.85 There is thus considerable stylistic evidence that Kirchner saw examples of Matisse's earliest graphic work in woodcut and lithography not only during his Berlin visit in January, 1909, but also later as well.8* 78 Contrast Pechstein's Junges Madchen of 1908-pure in hue, spontaneous in touch, and consistently two-dimensional in representation-with his more conventional Madchen in Rot unterm Sonnenschirm of 1909 (cf. Buchheim, 1956, 305, 297), or his After the Bath exhibited in Dresden in June, 1909 (cf. Fig. 38, right). 79 Anonymous, "Schwarz-weissausstellung der Berliner Sezession," Kunst und Kiin- stler, 4 (January), 1909, 186.

Barr's discussion (1951, 108f.) of critical reaction to Matisse in Berlin may be supplemented by a fascinating passage by Julius Elias, published a few months later, in which Matisse is recognized as the head of a school with young adherents in both France and Germany; Julius Elias, "Das zehnte Berliner Sezessionsjahr," Kunst und Kiinstler, 9 (June), 1909, 396f. 82 The date is provided in a Berlin postal-stamp on a postcard to Erich Heckel, signed by Kirchner (with additional greetings from Pechstein); the postcard is in the col- lection of the Altonaer Museum, Hamburg. 83 Barr, 1951, 100. 84 Both Kirchner woodcuts (Sch. 151, 161) were published in 1911; Der Sturm, 78 (September), 1911, 623; 81 (October), 1911, 647. 85 Illustrated in: Barr, 1951, 325; medium verified as woodcut in (catalogue) Los Angeles, 1966, 163, Nos. 234f. 86 The Altonaer Museum, Hamburg, possesses Kirchner drawing-postcards post- marked in Berlin on the following dates in 1909, in addition to January 12: October 23, November 21 and November 28.

Both reliably dated Kirchner drypoints of 1909, Girl Bathing near Iron Stove and Portrait of Dodo, as well as the reliably dated etching Nude Seated on a Bed (see Appendix I), all display something of that superb finesse and extreme linear economy originally developed in Matisse's line lithographs of 1906. More specifically, Matisse's 1906 lithograph Half Length Nude, Eyes Cast Down (Fig. 35) is alone the most probable progenitor for a long series of Kirchner lithographs of female nudes in the course of the year 1909, executed almost wholly in line.87 These include the reli- ably dated Recumbent Nude with Hands on Stomach, Sch. 91 (see Appendix I) and Girl Washing Her Breasts, Sch. 94 (Fig. 36). The exquisite line-quality in Matisse's Half Length Nude is not matched in Kirchner's more aggressively stroked Girl Washing, but the idiom of the German work clearly reflects the spontaneous vitality of Matisse's linear language. Nor does one find in many of these Kirchner prints a thematic similarity to Matisse's self-contained nudes; Kirchner's figures are gen- erally more active, occasionally even hectic, in gesture and expression. But the Matisse-inspired curvilinear grace and utmost economy of line bespeak a new drawing style which, through Kirchner's example, rapidly became the standard for Briicke intaglio and lithographic work during the last years in Dresden. One further Matisse line lithograph, Harbor at Collioure of ca. 1906, may be presumed the direct source for Kirchner's drypoint Wannsee near Potsdam with Motorboat, Sch. 131, datable during one of the latter's Berlin visits in 1910.88 Not only are the subjects all but identical, but the Kirchner work is one of the first consistently to utilize linear width-variations and discontinuities for space-suggestion, as Matisse so suc- cessfully does here. Other (but not all) Kirchner etchings from 1910 display some degree of this type of linear refinement. When we return to early 1909 to consider Kirchner's paint- ing development, we find that the influence of Matisse's paint- ings is primarily responsible for the alleged Briicke-Fauve "parallel" long observed by critics. In particular it is the painting with which we initiated our discussion of Kirchner's unreliable dating, Girl under Japanese Umbrella (Fig. 2), which most strongly suggests that the most famous Matisse oil paintings of his wife, Woman with the Hat and the Green Line (both from late 1905),89 were included among the Fauve portraits mentioned in the review of the January, 1909 Matisse exhibition at Cassirer's. In the flesh areas of Kirchner's Girl the "splotchy" application of paint in many hues recapitulates Matisse's treatment in the face of the Woman, while the par- ticular hues chosen by Kirchner are essentially identical to those used in the Green Line: yellows and pinks, alleviated by cooler colors, in the flesh; and intense blue for the hair. If these Matisse paintings were exhibited at Cassirer's in 1909, the Girl under Japanese Umbrella, originally undated but later misdated "06," cannot have been painted before that year. A German Fauve Style Kirchner's stylistic development in painting from late 1908 through the summer of 1909 can now be outlined with some certainty, in part thanks to the recovery of documents per- taining to the 1909 Briicke exhibition in Dresden. Like the two preceding annual shows it was installed in Emil Richter's Art Salon. But since it was held in June (rather than in September as was customary), Heckel, who had spent the spring in Rome, was represented-as one reviewer noted-mainly by earlier works from 1908. In addition, Schmidt-Rottluff is seen as having "remained most faithful to his earlier tendencies," so that it is the new work of Pechstein and Kirchner which most concerns the critics. Writing in the Dresdener neueste Nach- richten on June 26, 1909,90 Fechter prefers Kirchner's work to Pechstein's (in contrast to the previous year). In fact the only negative criticism in the entire review is accorded to Pech- stein's large-scale After the Bath" (cf. Fig. 38, right), where that artist is accused of "bluff." With regard to Kirchner's paintings, Fechter writes: Kirchner has sent the best work of the entire exhibition, The Masks. The principles of the group here become evident in purest form: the wish for a picture based upon nature, but only as material for a (more or less consciously) simplified and constructed synthesis. While avoiding any kind of "natu- ralism," the synthesis depicts the essentials of the impression with the most forceful of means. More vigorously than his other works, Kirchner's picture shows this tendency most clearly despite a few weaknesses (see the right arm of the right-hand girl). The Dancer catches an interesting moment in the movement of a twirling skirt. In the linearity too, a con- 87 Including (in addition to Sch. 91 and 94) Sch. 92, 118, 123 and 130 with minor touches of tone and, entirely in line, Sch. 101, 102, 110, 119, 125, 141 and 148. 88 The Matisse work is illustrated in Barr, 1951, 61. For a Kirchner letter dated March 31, 1910, mentioning Matisse, see Wietek, 1962, No. 208, p. 47. From post- card postal-stamps, Kirchner's presence in Berlin during 1910 can be recorded on April 17, May 20, October 11 and October 20. 89 Barr, 1951, Frontispiece and p. 75. 90 Paul Fechter, "Kunstsalon Richter," Dresdener neueste Nachrichten, 170 (June 26), 1909, 1. 91 The amazon-like proportions of female figures in this painting, as in the related Weiber mit getbem Tuch simultaneously exhibited at the Berliner Secession (cata- logue, Berlin, 1909, No. 194) suggest the influence of Max Beckmann, a regular Secession exhibitor for several years. Particularly the pose of a major figure in both Pechstein paintings, with her lower arm held tightly in a horizontal position across the waist, is identical to the arm placement of the major figure in Beck- man's Schlacht, exhibited in the Secession the previous year (catalogue, Berlin, 1908, No. 14).</page><page sequence="28">350 The Art Bulletin tinuing study of the principles of Degas and Lautrec (whose influence is in general very strong) is amusingly displayed; as a whole the painting lacks the formal compactness of The Masks. Strong Japanese influences play a role in the two [paintings of] Trees in Bloom, and as well in the red Lady; but in the latter the personal signature is somewhat strongly sub- merged in the two-dimensionality; nevertheless results are also attained here showing all sorts of promise, even if a definitive solution has not yet been reached. From this passage it is possible to recognize two previously unpublished Kirchner photographs in the Kirchner Archive as illustrating parts of the exhibition installation (Figs. 37, 38).92 Three of the paintings discussed by Fechter can be identified from these photographs. The "Masks" is Two Women with Masks, about 150 x 120cm (Fig. 37, left), and one of the "Trees" is Trees in Bloom, about 60 x 70cm (Fig. 38, sixth from left); present locations of both works are unknown. The larger of the "Trees" is the Landscape in Spring, 70 x 90cm, now in the Pfalz Gallery, Kaiserslautern (Fig. 38, left). One small painting in one of the exhibition photographs was not mentioned: Red Tulips, 66 x 55cm, now in a Zurich private col- lection (Fig. 37, fourth from left). Not shown in either exhibition photograph is the "Dancer," which is undoubtedly the paint- ing later titled by the artist Russian Dancers, 92 x 79cm, in the City Museum, Bielefeld.93 Fechter's "red Lady" is probably identical with the "goggle-eyed girl" which Richard Stiller, in a review of the same exhibition,94 includes among several summarily dismissed as "colored caricatures"; in the absence of more precise information, however, no specific identification can here be made. Stiller's only other mention of a Kirchner painting is positive: the "Dancer" is found to be "good in tone,. . . in movement not without animation." All of these exhibited paintings appear to have been exe- cuted in the months immediately preceding the June, 1909 show. The Trees in Bloom and the similar Landscape can date no earlier than April because of their subject matter. Although later repainted by the artist, Russian Dancers appears stylis- tically contemporary. The Two Women with Masks is stylis- tically the most advanced (as well as the largest in scale) of the exhibited works; although presaged by one or two earlier paintings from the end of 1908,95 the Masks itself was most probably created in May, 1909. These paintings may in turn be compared with the Diisseldorf Girl under Japanese Um- brella (Fig. 2) and the two reliably dated oil paintings from 1909 (see Appendix I). The reliably dated Reclining Nude in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, must have been executed at the very outset of the year 1909, shortly after the North- ampton Dodo and Her Brother from late 1908. Red and blue contours (more often than not, discontinuous) here merge into a uniformly articulated, almost patterned, surface. Pure hues in small tentative touches are present, but the decrease in surface opacity when compared to work from the previous summer is still one of degree only. Then, in the months imme- diately following the confrontation with Matisse's work, first color and then contour are gradually emancipated from their secondary roles. In the Diisseldorf Girl the individual color areas of the flesh are somewhat larger than those used in the Boston Nude; the blue hair and "shadows" and the pure yellow, green and red in the background create striking chro- matic harmonies. In turn the "linearity" in the Kaiserslautern Landscape and the Bielefeld Dancers, which Fechter could only attribute to the influence of Degas, Lautrec and Japanese sources, is instead the first embodiment in painting of the Matisse-inspired linear economy developed in Kirchner's litho- graphs during these months. The final stage of linear auton- omy in the paintings occurs early in the second half of 1909- at least concomitantly the result of a more economical painting technique which Heckel claims to have developed in Rome and transmitted to Kirchner upon his return to Dresden that sum- mer.9" Now are created such supremely economical Kirchner oils as the reliably dated Streetcar in Dresden (Dr. Max Fischer collection, Stuttgart; see Appendix I), where perhaps one-third of the primed canvas is left untouched in the finished work and where gracefully flowing contours appear to have the spontaneity of a rapid sketch. The June, 1909 Briicke exhibition was the first to display those Fauve-oriented works upon which the group's national and international reputations were eventually to be based. It is relevant therefore to cite several general reactions of Stiller and Fechter as the only known eyewitness accounts of the show available to us today. Stiller's critique combines satire 92 Fig. 37, left to right: 1) Kirchner (see text); 2) Heckel, Italiener beim Mittagessen (Vogt, 1965, No. 1909/9); 3) Schmidt-Rottluff, Landscape (Q); 4) Schmidt-Rotluff, Am Bahnhof, 1908 (Grohmann, 1956, 253); 5) Schmidt-Rottluff, Erich Heckel in gelber Oeljacke, 1908 (Grohmann, 1956, 174); 6) Kirchner (see text); 7) Pechstein, Portrait in Red with a Yellow Book, 1908; 8) Heckel, Riimische Modelle (Vogt, 1965, No. 1909/12).

Fechter states "Heckel ist nur mit ilteren Stiicken vertreten, aus dem Vorjahre," suggesting that Die Miihle, now dated "EH 07," may actually have been executed in 1908; on the other hand, Fechter's statement would imply that both of Heckel's other paintings should date from the outset of the Italian trip in late 1908, rather than in 1909 as now catalogued. 93 Of these Kirchner works, only the Russian Dancers has previously been published. In its original state it was illustrated in Grohmann, 1926, pl. 24. The present state, almost completely reworked by the artist, has recently been widely reproduced, in color in Grohmann, 1961, 19. Other paintings mentioned by reviewers of the</page><page sequence="29">KIRCHNER IN DRESDEN 351 and scorn (as well as total incomprehension of the Briicke's sources) in words recalling those which first greeted the Fauves in Paris a few years earlier: In case the sympathetic observer should greet this year's . . . paintings by shaking his head a little less energetically (which is by no means certain), it certainly would not follow that ... more presentable works, easier to understand, have now been brought forth. Much more would this then merely confirm the old saying, that one finally gets used to everything-even to Hell, as a learned man has said.... the French impressionists, Gauguin and Van Gogh are creating a hazardous disturbance in the lineage of the Briacke painters. Even now one will not be able to gainsay the merits of lucid coloring, but they as usual lie under the curse of these [French] prototypes, whose individuality is too sharply stamped, too much the expression of particular eccentric temperaments, for other worthy painters to be able lightly to appropriate their manner. The ... time has come [for the Briicke] vigorously to pursue a definite artistic goal, instead of coquetting in a half barbaric, half refined manner. By way of contrast Fechter applauds precisely that progress of the Briicke towards its goal which Stiller found lacking and, most perceptively, challenges the public (rather than the art- ists) to close the gap between popular taste and the new artis- tic achievement: The signature [of this year's Briicke exhibition] is related to that of last year-and yet one senses another. A greater clarity is becoming evident: a stronger sense of having understood their goals; a greater consciousness of their own will ... No exhibition of the BrAcke has yet produced so unified an effect, in spite of the still stronger differentiation of individual visions which is slowly taking place.... It is somewhat tragic and at the same time exhilarating to call to mind at this exhibition the facts that the ultimate yearning of these men is towards law (albeit with freedom), and that they are in the process of seeking it through means which the whole world decries as lawless and licentious. One can rarely see as clearly as here how activity in art has today become detached from the gen- eral run of things. My realm is in a totally different world. I believe in totally different possibilities and necessities, see completely different things originating, perceive art as the liberating factor [operating] at psychological levels where even these things are not yet relevant .... [The Briecke's] strength, which here seeks new paths, deserves recognition by now for the sake of the result attained: especially, as indicated, the greater knowledge which now goes hand in hand with [the earlier] faith. In general we must see the Briicke style emerging between the summer seasons of 1908 and 1909 as both clearer and stronger, more reasoned and yet more mature. In Kirchner's case the development of a Fauve painting style was an organic one, proceeding from the Van Gogh-inspired reliance upon streaklike application of pure hues to a much less articulated, more two-dimensionalized synthesis of these same pure colors under Matisse's influence. Concurrently the earlier impasto structure gave way to a surprisingly sketchlike, thinly painted surface. This represents, in broad outline, the same path of evolution followed by the French Fauves some three to four years earlier in Paris. That Kirchner was originally influenced by Van Gogh, Munch and Matisse should in fact be no more surprising than that, say, Derain or Braque were initially dependent upon Van Gogh, Cezanne and Matisse. For Kirch- ner's "half barbaric, half refined" style, far from being merely derivative, represents in retrospect precisely that vehicle nec- essary for the successful transplantation of modern art to German soil. The German Fauve style, once established in Dresden, was rapidly appropriated and elaborated by artists in Munich and Berlin to become the dominant language of the German avant- garde during 1910 and 1911.97 But among the Briicke artists, and especially within the oeuvre of Kirchner himself, the achievement of the new style was not marked by any cessa- tion of formal experimentation, but rather by a period of continuing assimilation and growth. The most important documentation available for Kirchner's stylistic development between the summers of 1909 and 1910 arises in connection with the comprehensive Briicke exhibition in the latter year, opening in September. 1909 Briicke exhibition, not illustrated in Figs. 37 and 38 (see note 92 above), are: (Amiet) "eine einsame kleine Arbeit"; (Pechstein) "Tennisspieler," "die Lauben"; (Heckel) "der Besuch" (see Vogt, 1965, No. 1908/6).

With the aid once again of two newspaper reviews by Fechter and Stiller,99 as supplemented by the partly illustrated exhibition catalogue and an unpublished photograph of part of the Arnold installa- tion (the latter in the Kirchner Archive), it is possible to iden- tify most of the ten exhibited Kirchner paintings. These in turn allow us to outline the artist's development during the year ending in September, 1910. Three Nudes at the Moritzburg Lakes, 90 x 120cm (location unknown) is from the Briicke's first100 summer of communal activity at Moritzburg in 1909, as is the Bathhouse near Dresden, 60 x 85cm (formerly in the Schroeder collection, Saarbrucken). The Blue House in the Potholder District, Dresden (measurements and location un- known) is identical in title, subject and style to the reliably dated etching of 1909 (see Appendix I). All three stress grace- ful contours and an extremely economical color usage in the manner of the previously mentioned Streetcar in Dresden of the summer or early autumn of 1909. The Blue House embodies the first moment, probably in the fall of 1909, when largely undifferentiated hues are laid on flatly within each set of shape-enclosing contours, a tendency soon consolidated into the purest mode of line and flat color areas. This least plastic of all Kirchner styles is seen in the four exhibited paintings apparently originating during the winter and spring of 1909-1910: Bicycle Race Track, 60 x 90cm (location un- known); Artist; Marcella, 100 x 76cm, private collection, Cologne; Marcella, 71.5 x 61cm, Modern Museum, Stockholm (cf. Fig. 42) and The Wooden Bowl, 60 x 70cm, Lehmbruck Museum, Duisburg. But in the late spring and summer of 1910 the paint surface is again more differentiated; the black con- tours, almost calligraphic in their new spontaneity, begin to assume a more expressive role--occasionally independent of the color areas which they are supposed to enclose. The freer approach in seen in Forest Road, 81 x 71cm, Dr. Arthur Weisz collection, New York, one of the latest of the paintings to be exhibited in September. The two remaining Kirchner oils at the Arnold exhibition can not yet be specifically identified.1?x Although the style of each of these works is generically Fauve, the degree of their variety underscores Kirchner's con- tinuing dissatisfaction with past attainments. No less a degree of variety is to be expected in works from late 1910 and 1911. Other methods, however, must here be explored for dating them, for without documents to identify the small collection of Briicke paintings shown at the Saxon Art Association be- tween September and December, 1910,102 and lacking reliably dated works after Kirchner's signature change in the summer of that year, the paintings at the Arnold exhibition are the last to be individually datable with documented certainty. It might be supposed that the Arnold Gallery Briicke exhi- bition finally resulted in some measure of public acceptance of the group of Dresden artists, now relatively mature after half a decade of artistic development. This was not the case. Well over half of Stiller's exhibition review consisted of an attack so intemperate and insulting as to rank among the classics of its type.103 And even the more favorable critique by Fechter was, under the circumstances, inadequate. Fechter ended his review of Briicke accomplishments (the last to be written in Dresden) by writing: "We must therefore leave even this exhibition with the words, '[Wait] for the next time!' " Fechter's failure to sense the artistic significance of those works which (only four years later) he was to acclaim as the incunabulae of German expressionism'04 must certainly 98 (Catalogue) Brticke, Dresden, Galerie Arnold, 1910.

R[ichard] S[tiller], "Der K.-G. Briicke bei Arnold," Dres- dener Anzeiger, 249 (September 9), 1910, 3. 100 The three summers of communal Briicke activity were 1909, 1910 and 1911 (inter- view Erich Heckel, January 30, 1954), not 1907-09 as indicated in recent sources be- ginning with Bolliger, 1952, 10. Heckel's statement brings into question the 1908 dates for three of his stylistically related paintings of Moritzburg nudes (Vogt, 1965, Nos. 1908/4, 1908/5, 1908/6), particularly the first, Badende am Teich, dated lower right "EH 08." That at least Heckel's Badende am Teich was painted in the summer of 1909 is supported by the evidence of two unpublished Kirchner drawing- postcards sent to Dr. Rosa Schapire (in care of Heckel, Dangast), now in the Galerie des 20. Jahrhunderts, Berlin. Both are postmarked "Dresden-Altstadt 9.9.1909." The drawing on one is in colored crayon and represents Elbe riverboats; the message reads "Besten Gruss Ihnen u. m. beiden Freunden." The other, read- ing "eine Bessere, beste Griisse," carries a drawing in ink and colored crayon of a nude bather. The subject of the nude drawing is thematically identical to the major right-hand figure of Heckel's Badende am Teich and, as well, to the same figure in Kirchner's similar oil painting composition of Girls Bathing in Lake Moritzburg (Julie Kirchner collection, Biberach). Both Heckel's and Kirchner's paintings were clearly done from nature, rather than one from another, so that one must assume that both paintings were created by the artists in Moritzburg, working side by side, in the summer of 1909--before Heckel visited Schmidt-Rott- luff and Dr. Schapire in Dangast "von August bis Ende Oktober" (Wietek, 1957, 33). This makes completely understandable Kirchner's mailing on the same day in September, 1909 of a drawing-postcard of Elbe riverboats executed months ear- lier (stylistically related to River Steamboat; cf. Fig. 23 and note 67 above) and then, on impulse, sending the second postcard with the nude drawing as a "better" effort, created just before Heckel's departure from Moritzburg a few weeks before. It is, conversely, difficult to believe either that Heckel executed the outdoor Moritzburg subject of Badende am Teich as late as October, 1908 (the month of his return from Dangast that year; Wietek, 1957, 33) or that Kirchner would have waited almost a year to send the nude subject as a "better" greeting. 101 Of the Kirchner paintings exhibited in 1910, the following have recently been illustrated: Bathhouse, in (catalogue) Lempertz Auktion, Cologne, 1959 (Decem- ber), No. 129; Artist, frequently, esp. (catalogue) Dusseldorf, 1960, No. 6, Urban, 1964, No. 60; Wooden Bowl, in Hiindler, 1964, 11, 146. The latter two, with Marcella (Fig. 42), are typical of Kirchner's style in early 1910 and may be compared with</page><page sequence="31">KIRCHNER IN DRESDEN 353 have disappointed the individual Briicke members; for these artists in search of a public, the move from Dresden to Berlin (in late 1911) must have appeared, increasingly, inevitable. From fall 1905 through the summer of 1910 it has been possible to trace individual Kirchner works to specific mo- ments never separated by more than a few months' time. But during the years 1909 and 1910 the artist's painting develop- ment can not completely be summarized (as could that of the preceding years) merely by isolating several representative works datable in each year. This is largely because Kirchner's painting production was quantitatively four to five times as great in the three years after the summer of 1908 as it was in the preceding three years.1"5 Although we are perhaps justified in labeling Kirchner's pictorial conception from 1909 to 1911 as "Fauve," in sum, we will find that in individual works deviations from the dominant style bespeak the re-emergence or emergence of non-Fauve prototypes as influencing factors. It is necessary to discuss some of these works here. Mentioned among the works exhibited in Dresden in Sep- tember, 1910, Kirchner's painting of Marcella in Stockholm (Fig. 42) is a case in point; one of Munch's central themes, Puberty (Fig. 39), is its ultimate source. The point of departure for Kirchner's painting is an ink drawing in the Ferdinand Ziersch collection, Wuppertal (Fig. 40). A thoroughly spon- taneous sketch, undoubtedly rendering the youthful Marcella in a chance pose from nature, the Kirchner drawing represents the model with feet crossed-a motif quite different from the crossed arms in Munch's painting. But the legs pressed tightly together, the curve of the right thigh, and the hair and head formation (even the flat chin) all mirror Munch's rendering in Puberty. The Wuppertal drawing in turn was the model for a similar, if somewhat summary, ink and water-color sketch (Fig. 41), sent as a postcard and postmarked June 30, 1910. Judging by stylistic similarities with the ink drawing reliably dated in 1909 (see Appendix I), both Marcella drawings may have been executed as early as the winter of 1909-1910 and the painted version of the subject may not have been executed long after. What is surprising in the Kirchner painting (Fig. 42) is the marriage of the Munch subject matter with the bold, colorful and two-dimensional forms of the Fauve painting style. For in the final analysis, the content of the Kirchner work differs sharply from that of Munch's. The Marcella painting can reincorporate the frontality of Munch's composi- tion (not stressed in either drawing) precisely because the naturally folded arms and crossed legs now bespeak a cheerful casualness utterly distant from the Norwegian's symbolic con- ception. Only the head and eyes in the painting still betray Marcella's true parentage.1o6 The extended duration of Kirchner's interest in Munch's art may be documented by the Portrait of Erich Heckel in the Hagen Museum (Fig. 44), now misdated "08" but in its orig- inal state dated by Heckel himself "early winter 1910-11."107 The distinctive placement of the legs in the Hagen portrait goes back to Kirchner's own earlier Dodo and Her Brother from late 1908, while the slightly turned face and the arm placement with hand in pocket still derive from Munch's Rathenau portrait (Figs. 24, 25). But several key elements in the Heckel composition were stimulated by yet another Munch portrait which Kirchner must have encountered in the inter- vening years, the Portrait of Count Kessler of 1906 now in Berlin (Fig. 43): the extreme verticality of format in the Hagen Heckel and the major background diagonal (so instrumental in unifying the composition) derive directly from this Munch source.108 The influence of Van Gogh's art after 1909 differs greatly from that exercised on earlier Kirchner paintings. The aspect of the 1888-1890 style that is now of critical importance for two other paintings from this time, widely published since 1950 as exemplifying Kirchner's Fauve style but actually repainted by the artist in Switzerland: Self- Portrait with Model, Kunsthalle, Hamburg (misdated "07" verso); and Seated Girl; Franzi, Institute of Arts, Minneapolis. 102 Paul Fechter, "Die Kiinstlervereinigung Dresden," Dresdener neueste Nachrichten, 244 (September 8), 1910, 1. 103 The Brficke 1910 catalogue traced the group's origin to "the necessity to clear a path for the efforts of the new German art." Stiller (September 9, 1910, 3) replied: "Doesn't this presumptuous and overly daring assertion require some strong qual- ification? . . . Can the more or less human images, which may here be seen crouching and standing, leaning and reclining and lolling about in color on canvas, affect us in a new way? As intoxicating or exalting creations? As profound revela- tions in line, movement and color of our innermost conceptions of sensuous beauty? . . . If some of these anthropomorphous horrors should seem (through feeble allusion) to affect countenances and deportment, then these call to mind the figures by much more famous and unobjectionable post-Impressionists-but only from afar. For everything here is so unattractive and unclear that only the super- ficial traits of the prototypes have been hit upon. Even the agility of bear cubs will never be successful in imitating the bold, kitten-lithe refinement of a French art no longer contemporary, mundane and demi-mondaine in scent. But on the other hand these experiments, obviously nourished by foreign sources, lack as well the quality of being German-that characteristic profundity, that turning inwards, which is shown in the work of such artists as B8cklin, Thoma, Mar6es and Ludwig Von Hofmann. That the slovenly deformities exhibited here should represent a new German art can only be considered as a grotesque joke, or as crass self- deception on the part of ill-advised artists." 104 See Fechter, 1914, 28 and passim; cf. discussion of Fechter's use of the word "ex- pressionism" in Gordon, 1966, 376-78. 105 Not including several executed before the Briicke's formation, 46 Kirchner paint- ings are listed in the forthcoming oeuvre catalogue through the summer of 1908 (including seven known to be on the verso of other canvases). From approximately September, 1908 through September, 1911 when Kirchner left Dresden, 205 paint- ings are catalogued (including 41 verso). 106 Appreciation is expressed to Christiane Nestl6, Marburg, whose remark concerning the similarity of expression in the Munch and Kirchner paintings preceded the discovery of the intermediary drawings. 107 Interview April 25, 1954. The Archive photograph of the early state (without sig- nature or date) shows a considerably wrinkled canvas, with resultant surface dam- age, as if the painting had been inexpertly rolled; most of the surface was re- painted before a second Archive photograph, depicting today's state, was made. o10s A parallel between the Heckel and the two Munch portraits was first suggested in Grohmann, 1956, 60.</page><page sequence="32">354 The Art Bulletin Kirchner is Van Gogh's use of spatial perspective for psycho- logical expressiveness-a characteristic rightfully stressed by Van Gogh critics.10o Kirchner's Railroad-Underpass, Dresden- L*btau, in the Ziersch collection, Wuppertal (Fig. 46), for example, bears a thematic similarity to Van Gogh's Railroad Underpass, Avenue Montmajour (Erich Maria Remarque col- lection, on loan to the Zurich Art Museum), a painting peri- odically in Germany after its first documented exhibition there in 1905.11? But the two pictures differ in that Van Gogh stresses a deep space, while Kirchner tips his ground plane downwards and thus limits any sense of absolute recession. The Kirchner painting in fact forces the space, as it were, in two different directions. In the left background, the grouping of sidewalk, lawn and houses between the termini of two diverging streets establishes a horizon whose relative depth is indicated by the street juncture and several small figures middleground. But the foreground street is tipped downward to the right and enlarged so dramatically, that it is rendered as if seen from a much higher (albeit closer) vantage point. Kirchner's binocular or, better, "two-speed" space here strik- ingly resembles that employed in Van Gogh's Public Garden at Arles, De la Faille 479 (Fig. 45), where the horizon formed by an island between two diverging roads in the upper left, the two middleground figures, and the steeply inclined road plane sweeping down to the right, are all present. The Public Garden was first reproduced in Germany in 1904 but its republication in 1910111 was most probably the occasion of influence upon Kirchner. For although three related draw- ings and a drypoint112 all depict the houses and diverging streets, only the painting includes the forward extension of the road and the railroad bridge itself. The earliest of the related drawings, lacking any unusual spatial distortion, may date from early 1910; the painting, in spite of its dates of "06" and "07" (recto and verso), appears to have originated after the September, 1910 Briicke exhibition. Since spatial distor- tions were soon to comprise one of the basic components of Kirchner's Berlin period style, it is well to emphasize the role played by Van Gogh's art in their initiation. Kirchner's dis- tortions arose far more in response to Van Gogh's dramatic tilting of space-planes and expressive manipulation of scale relationships than from the "plunging view" incorporated into some works by Matisse and Derain.113 The year 1910 appears to be the year of Kirchner's first ex- tensive interest in yet another (in retrospect, critically impor- tant) type of art: primitive sculpture and other artifacts from Africa and Melanesia in the Dresden Ethnological Museum. A letter dated March 31, 1910, states: "The Ethnographical Museum here is open again .... A few things by the Pueblos from Mexico are still exhibited, and some negro sculptures." A postcard dated June 20, 1910, reports that "the balcony is really beautiful," a reference to carved wooden beams from New Guinea that had been installed as a balcony in the Ethno- logical Museum as early as 1902 (with some Melanesian figure sculpture acquired as early as 1897). Both the letter cited and another one, undated, carry ink drawings of standing figures, apparently of Cameroon origin.114 Until 1910, the museum's accession of African works had occurred slowly. Only seven pieces were acquired from Africa before 1906, and while nineteen other heads and figures from Togo and the Came- roons were added between 1906 and 1909, none were more than nineteen inches in height. By comparison, accessions from Africa (primarily Cameroon in origin) numbered more than fifty objects in the year 1910 alone, of which several were three-quarters life-size."-' Pending documentation of Kirchner's own early sculptural development (first in tin casting before mid-1910, then in wood carving) it would be premature to assess the full signifi- cance of Cameroon sculpture as a Briicke prototype in Dres- den.116 Nevertheless it is no longer possible to assume that Kirchner's discovery of these artifacts in any way antedates Vlaminck's discovery of African sculpture in Paris in 1905.117 Not only does one Briicke member categorically state that he was unaware of African sculpture in the summer of 1906,11s but there is in fact no evidence to indicate Kirchner's creative 109 Novotny, 1953, 36: "Van Gogh's personal contribution to spatial representation lies in the frequent intensification of the effects of perspective." Cf. Schapiro, 1951, 28-31: "For Van Gogh perspective [is] a dramatic element in vision, . . . both nearness and remoteness are stirring qualities. And his impulse is to give them both a live expression." 110 F. 480 was first exhibited in Dresden in November 1905: see note 26 above. It was exhibited again at the Sonderbund International Exhibition in Cologne, opened in April, 1912. 111 Meier-Grife, 1904, m1, pl. 34; Meier-Grife, 1910, 62. I am indebted to Mark Roskill, Cambridge, for suggesting the Public Garden as a possible source for Kirchner's Railroad Bridge. 112 A pencil drawing in the Kirchner Estate, with a row of foreground trees dwarfing the house group and a single figure on the left, first depicts the scene in normal (albeit strong) perspective recession; the drypoint (Sch. 121) essentially reproduces the drawing in mirror image. A drawing in pen and ink with water color in the Stidelsches Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt, approaches closer to the house-group, adds the low domed circular building on the right, and includes six figures; it is in all major respects the prototype for the background area of the painting, except that the downward curve of the lawn in the painting (as in the drypoint) is much greater than in either drawing, where it remains nearly horizontal. It is of course the combined perspectives of the more distant and nearer views in the two draw- ings (heightened still further by the introduction of the large-scale foreground) which accounts for the "two-speed" spatial distortion in the oil. Both drawings show characteristics of the 1910 style; particularly the calligraphic spontaneity of the foliage in the Frankfurt version recalls that of the Forest Road painting of mid-1910 exhibited in September (cf. discussion above, p. 352). Yet another drawing of the house-group faces still more sharply to the right to include a five- car freight train; this version (in pen and wash, illustrated in catalogue, Cam- pione, 1964, 34) appears no longer concerned with the spatial problem of this painting but instead, with its two tall railroad pylons, looks forward to the 1911 Train-Station Approach (catalogue, Dusseldorf, 1960, No. 23). 113 The latter view is offered by Dorival, 1961, 385. Dorival's suggestion that the spatial representation in Kirchner's West Harbor, Frankfurt from 1916 (Stidtische Galerie, Frankfurt) derives from Derain's Tower Bridge, London of 1906 (formerly Biihrle collection, Zurich) lacks credibility from either the viewpoint of style or, considering the time interval involved, of history. 114 Kirchner correspondence in the collection of the Altonaer Museum, Hamburg. 115 Letter from Dr. S.

The only sculptures depicted in the previously</page><page sequence="33">KIRCHNER IN DRESDEN 355 interest in non-Western sculptural sources before the year 1909. And even in that year Kirchner's concern for primitive art is directed as much towards the creation of studio draperies and furniture'19 as towards personal stylistic innovation. The color woodcut Bathers Throwing Reeds (Sch. 121) is exceptional among the three Kirchner prints included in the 1910 Briicke graphic portfolio in its introduction of two tri- angular faces and its slight stress on angular elbows and knees and other straight-line forms; the other prints in the port- foliol20 are conceived in terms of those graceful curvilinear contours typical of Kirchner's Matisse-inspired graphic style in 1909 (cf. Figs. 33, 36). Since one of these prints represents a Moritzburg theme introduced during the summer of 1909 and since the portfolios were normally issued at the outset of each year (in this case, 1910), one infers that the Bathers woodcut was executed late in 1909, though depicting a summer theme. The ink drawing, Two Dancers, reliably dated in 1909 (see Appendix I), because of its use of angular elbows and pointed feet, must also be dated toward the very end of that year. But all of the reliably dated works of 1910 (see Appendix I) are characterized by some degree of angularity of limbs, hands and facial features-attributable to the influence of similar stylizations in Cameroon sculpture. In the reliably dated ink drawing Bather in Studio, in fact, the profile forehead and nose rendered in a continuous straight line, the chin and wrist drawn in straight-edged angles, the enlarged lips and the pro- truding rounded stomach are combined to produce a figure- type which is African not merely in manner but in abstract and expressive spirit as well. In the course of 1910 Kirchner's paintings too display a tautness of shape, a stress on parallel and diagonal accents, which depart from the gracefully formed curves characterizing the earlier stage of Fauve inspiration. This development may be seen among the 1910 paintings already illustrated, from the still partially curvilinear conception in Marcella early in the year (cf. Fig. 42) to the more rigorously angular and geometric forms used later in the Portrait of Heckel (Fig. 44) and in the foreground figures of Railroad-Underpass (Fig. 46). By 1911, in such well-known dated works as the Half-Length Nude with Hat in the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum, Cologne, Kirchner's Fauve style has been transformed into a vehicle of primitive expression rivaled in animistic force only by some paintings of Picasso's slightly earlier African period. Thus by later 1910 and 1911 examples of primitive art seen in the Dresden Ethno- graphical Museum had basically affected Kirchner's entire style and were to contribute to his increasing interest in other forms of non-Western art. In the course of July, 1910 Heckel (and for the first time, Pechstein) joined Kirchner at the Moritzburg Lakes for the second summer of communal Briicke activity while Schmidt- Rottluff, as was his custom, remained in Dangast until mid- November.121 Thus most of the group was present in Dresden for the previously described Briicke exhibition at the Arnold Gallery in September, and for the second major event which occurred simultaneously in the same gallery. This was the first retrospective exhibition of paintings by Paul Gauguin ever to be held in the Saxon capitol.122 As with the confrontation of Fauve art with Briicke work in an exhibition exactly two years earlier, the simultaneous showing of paintings by Gauguin and the Dresden group pro- vided Fechter with an opportunity to publish certain didactic observations: "Only after [Gauguin's] death in Dominique in 1903 did people become more and more interested in him .... And when one wanders through the Briicke exhibition upstairs in the Arnold Gallery, one sees how contemporary his tenden- cies are here at home. One sees the common element . . . : namely the conceptual, which is continually emerging here, as there. And in front of the endeavors of today's generation, still really concerned with the same problems that interested Gauguin and his generation twenty years ago and more, one becomes still more reflective than one was before."23 Al- though the catalogue for the twenty-six exhibited Gauguin paintings has not yet been recovered, contemporary reviews mentioned Archive photograph of part of the September, 1910 Arnold Brticke exhi- bition are four tin castings and three wood sculptures (the latter allegedly by Heckel), all diminutive in scale. It must be assumed then that Kirchner's extremely significant sculptural oeuvre in wood, numbering well over fifty pieces, did not begin until 1910 or later; cf. Marsalle, 1925, 695-701. 117 As once believed by Alfred H. Barr, Jr.; see (catalogue) New York, 1931, 10; cf. Arntz, 1948, 13: "Schon aus dem Jahre 1904 kennen wir Zeichnungen Kirchners nach afrikanischen und Siidsee-Skulpturen. ... ." The drawings referred to (from late 1909 and 1910) were misdated by the artist and published in Grohmann, 1925, esp. Nos. 7, 9, 10. Kirchner himself dated the discovery in 1903 (!), in the auto- biographical fragment published in (catalogue) Bern, 1954-55. 118 Interview Erich Heckel, April 25, 1954. With reference to certain detail work carved in hard wood for architect Wilhelm Kreis's entry in the Dresden Arts and Crafts exhibition (opened in June, 1906), Heckel recalled: "Ich hlitte nicht ein hartes Holz schneiden kinnen, ohne das Gefihl dass man bei den Negern hfitte haben miissen." 119 The painting of Frinzi in Carved Chair (Thyssen collection, Lugano-Castagnola; cf. Urban, 1964, 41) appears stylistically contemporary with Marcella of early 1910 (Fig. 42). But the studio chair which gives the painting its title is said by Heckel (interview April 25, 1954) to have been carved by Kirchner in the winter of 1908- 09. It is apparently the first piece of Briicke furniture to derive from Cameroon sources: in anthropomorphic shape, it was carved out of linden planks and painted pink and black. Briicke studio draperies after African or New Guinea ornamental designs are depicted in the backgrounds of a number of Kirchner paintings of 1910, as well as in Bathing Nudes in a Room, Saarland Museum, Saarbrucken (catalogue, Diisseldorf, 1960, No. 16). In its original state (Grohmann, 1926, pl. 19) the latter painting most probably dates from the end of 1909: conceived in line and flat color areas like all paintings from fall, 1909 to spring, 1910 (cf. discussion above, p. 352), its still graceful curvilinear forms relate it, however, more to the drawing style of late 1909 (i.e., the reliably dated Portrait of Dodo drypoint, Appendix I) than to that of 1910 briefly characterized below. 120 The woodcut Dancer with Raised Dress (Sch. 126) and the drypoint Three Nudes at the Moritzburg Lakes (Sch. 52); cf.

The first Dresden exhibition to include even a few Gauguin paintings, from his "early period," occurred in late 1906 (see above, p. 341). The first extended discussion in Dresden of Gauguin's general significance occurred in an expository article published on the last day of 1907: Paul Fechter, "Gauguin," Dresdener neueste Nachrichten, 355 (December 31), 1907, 1. Nevertheless, no large-scale Gauguin exhibition is documented during the early Briicke years. 123 Dresdener neueste Nachrichten, 259, 1910, 1.</page><page sequence="34">356 The Art Bulletin are fortunately specific enough to identify almost all by theme and period, if not always by specific current titles.124 It is not surprising that so important an exhibition was to have both short-term and long-range influence upon Kirchner and his art. The first link between Gauguin and the Dresden artist was actually forged immediately before the opening. As Fechter noted, "One of the Briicke artists designed the poster for the exhibition"; that artist was Kirchner. Reproduc- ing one of the exhibited paintings, Gauguin's Portrait of His Mother of 1893, State Gallery, Stuttgart (Fig. 47), Kirchner's woodcut poster (Fig. 48) is the most artistically significant among the eleven posters produced by Briicke artists before 1914 and is, incidentally, the only one which has never pre- viously been published.125 Printed in blue on yellow paper to incorporate the major hues of the Gauguin original, Kirchner's portrait is remarkable whether judged as likeness or as work of art. Noteworthy is the shaving of the woodblock within the facial area in order to provide subtle off-black modula- tions for eyesockets, nostril and cheek planes. The Iberian delicacy of features is recorded most sensitively, especially in eyes and mouth-so much so that the specific ancestry of Gauguin's mother is as unmistakably suggested in the wood- cut as in the painting. Yet numerous variations in detail show how independently Kirchner has translated his source to fit the requirements of relief graphic art. The enclosure of the head within an irregular, discontinuous frame directly enhances the graphic contrast of an already graphic composition, while the more dynamically curvilinear external contours of the hair masses nicely compensate for more the plastic treatment of the hair possible in the painting medium. The greatest discrep- ancy arises in the handling of the near shoulder: Kirchner's reverse-curve contour is sufficient to lend a feeling of solidity to the upper torso, complementing the heightened sense of vol- ume animating the head mass. Even the woodcut text, no dif- ferent in form from that of the contemporary Briicke exhibi- tion poster and catalogue, nevertheless harmonizes with the pictorial forms above as perfectly as if designed for this pur- pose. Other derivations from Gauguin sources in Kirchner's paint- ings,126 and especially in graphic works, are all from 1911. These include the lithograph, Reclining Nude E. Seen from the Back (Sch. 204), which is a compositional variation of Gau- guin's Spirit of the Dead Watches of 1892 (A. Conger Goodyear collection, New York): the latter was almost certainly included in the Arnold exhibition.127 Another 1892 Gauguin composi- tion, Ta Matete; The Market now in the Basel Art Museum (Fig. 49), was among the exhibited works which prompted one critic to see "Egyptian harmonies."128 Here one notes those same Egyptian conventions of profile head and waist with frontal view of shoulders and arms that appear in the right- hand figure of a Kirchner lithograph from the summer of 1911, Bathing Bohemians, Sch. 182 (Fig. 50). The hieratic stiffness in the rendering of the bent right arm of Kirchner's bather is identical to Gauguin's treatment of the last Tahitian woman seated on the right in Ta Matete. Interesting as these comparisons are, they do not fully indi- cate the essential role which the experience of Gauguin's work had for the individual artists in Dresden. Certainly the trips to the South Pacific by Pechstein as well as Nolde within the following four years attest to the attraction exercised by the post-Impressionist's life and art. But Kirchner's reaction to Gauguin was to lead to a different response-in many ways, the most creative of all. The Experience of Ajanta It now seems that the Gauguin exhibition served as the neces- sary catalyst in centering Kirchner's attention on the funda- mental stylistic and thematic possibilities to be found in non- Western art in general. Before the Gauguin exhibition, the primitive works in the Dresden Ethnographical Museum were objects of aesthetic appreciation, curiosities whose "otherness" was provocative in suggesting decor for studio appointments 124 Dresdener neueste Nachrichten, 247 (September 11), 1910, 2: "Ober die Ausstellung erscheint ein Katalog mit Vorwort von Dr. R. Meyer-Riefstahl in Paris." Accord- ing to this notice, the identical exhibition (with catalogue) had been shown in Munich in August. Aside from five paintings of the Brittany period, the following Gauguin paintings from after 1887 are mentioned by the reviewers: "Christus am Oelberg," "Landschaft aus Aries," "Sonnenblumen," "Josef und Potiphars Weib," "Badenden," "Tahitifamilie," "die zwei Frauen," "Miidchen in rotem Kleid," "Landschaft mit Palmen," "der b6se Geist," "Gruppe unter Palmen" (perhaps identical with "die braune Menschen unter Palmen"), "Junger Mann in totem Mantel und blauem Rock," "Kiistenlandschaft mit ausschriumendem blauen Meer," "der kleine Knabe," "Menschliche Elend," "der Heilige Berg," and "Land- schaft von 1891." 125 For the others, see Bolliger and Kornfeld, 1958, Nos. 47-55, 57. Heckel's recollec- tion that he collaborated with Kirchner on a woodcut poster refers not to the Gauguin poster (Heynig, 1956, 56; Dube-Heynig, 1961, 32), but to that for "Der Neue Kunstsalon" (Bolliger and Kornfeld, 1958, No. 57). Whereas both signatures are carved in the block used for the latter poster, only Kirchner's name is carved in the Gauguin poster woodcut block, lower left (confirming Fechter's reference to "one of the Briicke artists . . ."). 126 In the Kirchner Archive is a photograph, made by the artist, depicting Gauguin's Tahitian Women Bathing of 1891-92 (Robert Lehman collection, New York); the painting is almost certainly identical to the "Badenden" exhibited in 1910. The back view of the nude holding her hair, the major motif of Gauguin's painting, is recapitulated with slight variations in the central figure of Kirchner's painting of</page><page sequence="35">KIRCHNER IN DRESDEN 357 and stylizations for a drawing shorthand. After the Gauguin exhibition, non-Western sources became for Kirchner the essential raw material for the ultimate attainment of personal style. Thus during a half-year period beginning around the fall of 1910, Kirchner went beyond the museum gallery into the library, seeking a more intimate acquaintance with extra- European sources. In the Central Art Library of the Dresden Museums he discovered among other books a two-volume illustrated work by John Griffiths, devoted to the wall paint- ings created about the sixth century A.D. in the Buddhist cave- temples at Ajanta, India.129 In the first volume he found 91 pages of plates with well over a hundred illustrations, averag- ing 13" x 11", with six of the largest rendered in color: wall paintings from the better preserved of the 28 Ajanta temples were reproduced through chromolithography with a high de- gree of faithfulness to the originals. Many years later in an autobiographical fragment Kirchner described the discovery as follows: "These works made me almost helpless with de- light. This unheard-of unity of representation, this monu- mental tranquillity of form, I thought I never would achieve. All my endeavors seemed hollow and restless to me. I copied a lot from the pictures, only to gain my own style .. .".13o With the recovery of the drawing copies of Ajanta subjects,131 we are thus able to trace the development of Kirchner's most per- sonal style in Dresden and, after 1911, in Berlin. Although the circumstances surrounding Kirchner's first en- counter with Griffiths' publication remain obscure, there are several reasons why he was at least prepared for the discovery. Beginning as early as May, 1905, Professor Wilhelm Kreis had made a trip from Dresden to India "to make a thorough study of old Indian temple structures";132 upon his return Kreis was for several years Heckel's employer, so that knowledge of In- dian temple architecture (if not also of Ajanta) was available to the Briicke artists from about 1906 on. Then, about 1907, Kirchner executed an ambitious series of five lithographs (Sch. 8-12) illustrating Sakuntala, the best known theater- piece by Kalidasa, the classic Indian poet and playwright, who died in the fifth century A.D. Finally there is the evidence of one of Kirchner's Ajanta drawings itself: the Crouching Girl (Fig. 51). In its simplicity of contour, naivete of expression and utter naturalness of pose, this drawing seems at first glance to be but a freehand rendering of any one of a number of Gauguin's Tahitian girls. Instead it is a direct copy of a single figure from Cave I in Ajanta, as illustrated by Griffiths (Fig. 52).133 What led Kirchner to select this particular figure for copying, if not its similarity to a recently seen figure in a paint- ing by Gauguin? Phrased differently, there is every likelihood that Kirchner's experience of Gauguin's art in September, 1910 caused him to recognize familiar forms in the Griffiths detail, if it did not indeed lead him to seek out the Griffiths book it- self. Much as Kirchner's first acquaintance with the lesser Fauve art of Marquet and Van Dongen in late 1908 had led him several months later to seek out the original source of Fauve expression in the work of Matisse, the Gauguin en- counter must have prompted him to attempt the mastery of principles underlying the "primitive" in art. There is, in fact, considerable evidence that Kirchner was seeking principles of form during his last months in Dresden, and that these principles were to be found in what must be called "classic" stages of non-Western art. Not only does Ajanta itself constitute a major achievement of the Buddhist classic age in India, but many of the more understated and formally balanced details were among those selected for copy- ing. Kirchner's references to "unity of representation" and "monumental tranquillity of form" are alone sufficient to in- dicate the meaning Ajanta held for the artist. Aside from the Ajanta copies, this interest in classic forms of non-Western ex- pression is found in one more direct copy, a pencil drawing, presently in the Kirchner Estate, after a Benin bronze relief (Fig. 53).134 Depicting three full-scale and two miniature male figures, the drawing defines attributes, facial ornament and hair and clothing styles accurately enough for specific iden- early 1911 of Two Nudes with Sculpture (known only in an Archive photograph). The typically Gauguinesque alternation of curve and straight line in the stylization of the hip and in the elongated elbow reappear as well in another Kirchner oil from this time, the Three Standing Nudes (formerly Gurlitt collection, Berlin). 127 Under the title of "der bise Geist" (see note 124 above). 128 Richard Stiller; for source, see note 122 above. 129 John Griffiths, The Paintings in the Buddhist Cave-Temples of Ajanta, Khandesh, India, London, 1896, I (Pictorial Subjects) and 1897, II (Decorative Details). The writer is greatly indebted to the staff of the Central Art Library of the Dresden Art Collections for recovering these volumes (the ones used by Kirchner) and for making them available in West Germany on interlibrary loan for an extended pe- riod in 1965; prior to my inquiry they had been presumed lost since 1945. 130 E.

For permission to photograph them, I am indebted to Roman Norbert Ketterer, Campione. 132 Dresdener neueste Nachrichten, 118 (May 3), 1905, 2. 133 Cf. discussion below. As in the other Ajanta copies, Kirchner reconstructs small areas lost through surface damage in the original. 134 It has not yet been possible to identify the specific Benin bronze prototype copied by Kirchner, but it is most probably a work in the British Museum published in Germany or England prior to 1911.</page><page sequence="36">358 The Art Bulletin tification, but the artist's primary interest clearly lies in the formal symmetry in the grouping of the five men and the re- markable series of shape repetitions which unify the design. The Benin prototype is from that shadowy seventeenth cen- tury kingdom whose role in the classic stage of African devel- opment is not unlike that of Ajanta in India's. Through its stylistic characteristics, Kirchner's Benin drawing is related to Ajanta copies datable around the spring of 1911.135 The evidence for the approximate dating of the Ajanta drawings appears conclusive, if only circumstantially so. No less than twenty have been discovered in the Kirchner Estate: differences in page size and, especially, in style suggest that they were executed a few at a time over a duration of months. One of the last drawings served as model for a major oil paint- ing datable in the late spring or early summer of 1911, which will be discussed below (cf. Fig. 64), while the Crouching Girl and several contemporary and slightly earlier drawings must still date from 1910. On the basis of page size and style we can group the twenty drawings into five successive series and date the earliest and latest groups in autumn, 1910 and spring, 1911 (see Appendix II). The stylistic evolution of the drawing copies from Ajanta sources is of signal importance, for in the course of copying from Griffiths' book Kirchner ap- pears to have been stimulated gradually to depart from the essentials of his earlier drawing style and, ultimately, to de- vise a new one. The steps leading to the birth of the post- Fauve style may be illustrated by representative examples from each of the five successive groups, here distinguished by Roman numerals. The two drawings from Group I must certainly represent the artist's first encounter with the Griffiths source. As copies they are tentative and inexact. Thus in comparison to its proto- type (Fig. 54), the Two Flutists and Dancer (Fig. 56) ignores precise facial characteristics, misjudges the anatomical position of the flutists' fingers and the dancer's right foot and hand, and generally replaces continuous curves with angular shapes (see the dancer's right shoulder or left elbow). Pencil was first used to block in the design, which was then completed in ink; but in both stages the internal formal relationships of the original were sacrificed in favor of the impromptu rhythms of a spon- taneous sketch. The drawing still reveals the artist's instinctive drawing style in the latter part of 1910; limited distortions of shape, of proportion, and of scale characteristically reinforce overall linear movement, while vestiges of angular stylization are still in evidence. The drawings from Group II, by contrast, are more clearly intended as copies. Pencil alone is now sufficient, and indeed preferable, for this purpose. In the Gauguin-like Crouching Girl discussed above (Fig. 51), the precise shape of eye and lips are recorded from the Ajanta source (Fig. 52), while the small flowers and blossoms below and to the right of the figure are placed with some exactitude; even individual drapery folds in the original are summarily indicated. Nevertheless, fidelity is not always attained: the right arm is too short and the thigh too large when compared to the original. In another drawing from this group, Girl with Jeweled Dress (see Appendix II), the grotesquely shortened left arm results, in all likelihood, from the awkward placement of the entire figure on the page. Perhaps the greatest difficulty for the artist in drawings from this group is the establishment of suitable graphic equivalents for the darker tones in the prototypes: zig-zag lines, pencil "smudges" and (in the Jeweled Dress) charcoal touches are all used indiscriminately. This latter problem is resolved in somewhat more consistent fashion in drawings from Group III, especially in the Harem Scene (Fig. 58) derived from an Ajanta figure group (Fig. 55). Now zig-zag lines alone are used specifically to block in areas of darker tone, while pencil smudges are restricted to fewer spots. In other drawings from the group (cf. Figs. 60, 66) the smudges function primarily as equivalents for modeled pas- sages of rounded forms-marking the artist's new interest in traditional problems of chiaroscuro drawing. In other respects the works from this group are the first to constitute completely faithful copies: in overall compositional movement as in fidel- ity of detail, the Harem Scene almost totally belies its origin in twentieth century Europe. Musicians and Dancer from Group IV (Fig. 57) was copied from the same Ajanta illustration (Fig. 54) which served earlier as source for the Two Flutists and Dancer from Group I, dis- cussed above (cf. Fig. 56). A comparison of the two drawing copies, separated in date most probably by a matter of months, gives some idea of Kirchner's intervening stylistic develop- ment. Even in so complex a design as the nine-figure composi- tion the artist's pencil picks out the individual forms with effortless exactitude, yet now succeeds in translating the Ori- ental forms into a spontaneously personal pictorial expression. 135 Cif. discussion below. The use of zig-zag lines at the edges of forms in Fig. 53 originates in the last Ajanta copies (Figs. 61, 63, 69, 70). 136 Marsalle, 1920, 217. 137 Among Kirchner oil paintings of 1911 the inspiration of Ajanta painting details (limited largely to exotic costumes or foliage, or to poses assumed by Indian fe- male bathers or dancers) may be seen in the following: Indian Dancer in Yellow Skirt (verso of Two Midinettes), Los Angeles County Museum of Art; Adam and Eve (verso of Portrait of Woman in White, Fig. 20), Mdnchengladbach, Alfred Otten collection; Dodo with Feather Hat, Milwaukee Art Center; Woman with Hat and Two Nudes (verso of the Living Room), Kunsthalle, Hamburg; Two Nudes</page><page sequence="37">KIRCHNER IN DRESDEN 359 The central dancer in the drawing of early 1911, when com- pared to her form in the earlier pencil and ink essay, is now realized with exquisite rhythm, utmost economy, but yet full faithfulness to the spirit of the Ajanta original. Only the un- resolved problem of shorthand equivalents for dark areas remains. Zig-zag strokes are now clearly preferred, but grey smudges are still used for the dancer's arms; and when it comes to the modeling of volumes, both are omitted. For all their progress, drawings from Group IV retain their basic affinity to the two-dimensional style dominant since late 1908 in Kirchner's oeuvre. In drawings from Group V the problem is finally solved, and the new style fully attained, as is seen by comparing Nude with Kerchief II (Fig. 61) with an earlier version from Group III (Fig. 60) and with the Ajanta prototype (Fig. 59). The later drawing now introduces zig-zag strokes as the equivalent for tonal modeling (prominent in the nude's right breast and thigh in the Indian painting), instead of the pencil smudges used in the earlier drawing. This new graphic device is present in all other works from Group V (cf. Figs. 63, 68, 70). With the shift to a wholly linear method of modeling, it was for the first time possible to suggest the illusion of volume by means of a graphic shorthand completely compatible with the basic in- gredients of the style itself. On the one hand the zig-zags used for modeling pictorially reinforce the zig-zags used for areas of darker value (as in the hair of Nude with Kerchief II). On the other, the representation of sculptural form--required for total fidelity to the Ajanta conception-becomes possible in graphic shorthand. The first of those "hieroglyphs" (the word is Kirchner's)136 so uniquely characteristic of the artist's Berlin style was therefore invented, before the summer of 1911, in Dresden. 1911 Sources for the Berlin Style It has now been established that all three of Kirchner's major style-changes in Dresden were stimulated by his encounter with important external sources. But while his discovery of paintings by Van Gogh in 1905, and of Fauve works in 1908- 1909, led to styles which bore parallels to those of other avant- garde artists in Germany, his fascination with Griffiths' illus- trations was to inaugurate a style essentially unique in the history of modern art. For the artist's ensuing Berlin style, upon which his historical significance is most firmly based, be- gan with the Ajanta encounter during his last year of Dresden residence. It is possible here merely to suggest several ele- ments of the Berlin style (and of certain preceding late Dresden works)137 which derive directly from Ajanta prototypes. In one of the better preserved details from the second cave- temple at Ajanta (Fig. 62), five partially nude figures stand against an architectural background in a near-tropical setting; playing at their feet are six children (the entire scene may represent an incident in the childhood of Buddha). J8 Kirchner was demonstrably fascinated by this work; he made no less than four drawings of the whole and of individual figures (see Appendix II and Fig. 70). Of these the drawing, Five Women (Fig. 63), is devoted to the compositional organization of the major figures, omitting several of the children below. Kirchner was particularly interested in the regular, horizontal repetition of heads and breasts across the upper part of the design, but he also insisted upon a more pictorially centralized composi- tion than is found even in this most formal of Ajanta figure arrangements. Kirchner makes the middle of the five women the tallest of the group and allows the two adjacent nudes more lateral room (compensating for their relative loss of height) by placing the extreme right-hand figure in front of, rather than within, the architectural setting. One of the most successful of the Ajanta drawings, this is nevertheless the only one consciously to depart from its prototype--as if look- ing forward to other possible pictorial variations on the Indian theme. And indeed Kirchner's oil painting Five Bathers at the Lake, in a Krefeld private collection (Fig. 64) provides the coda to the series of copies from the Buddhist scene. In the painting (which must date from the late spring of 1911 or, just possi- bly, July)139 the Dresden artist has given us an Indian harem, as it were, in modern dress. The first bather pats her hair, in an ageless feminine gesture, but the introduction of towel and mirror as props for other figures helps to modernize the theme. Still, the bathing-caps on the second and third figures perform the same pictorial function as the patterned headdresses of the Indian women, while the palm foliage taken over intact from the Ajanta prototype provides a satisfactory (if slightly exotic) setting for the Kirchner scene. The direction of compositional change already present in the Five Women drawing has been accelerated, the figures pushed even further to the right-hand side of the composition, with the resulting imbalance cor- (verso of Nudes Bathing in Mountain Brook), formerly Feigl Gallery, New York. 138 Griffiths, 1896, I, 29f. 139 From postcards in the collection of the Altonaer Museum, Hamburg, it can be as- certained that Kirchner (with Otto Mueller) was in Mnischek, Bohemia, on July 26 and 31, 1911, and in Prague on August 3. That Kirchner's summer sojorn at the Moritzburger Lakes occurred in August (rather than before the Bohemian trip) is indicated by Heckel's presence in Prerow on the North Sea in June and early July, according to postcards addressed to him there between June 14 and July 7, 1911. Since Kirchner's Five Bathers at the Lake is datable before these summer trips, on stylistic grounds, a terminus ante in the third week of July is certain.</page><page sequence="38">360 The Art Bulletin rected by the relegation of the fifth figure to a more subsidiary, crouching position. By exaggerating the differences in the angles of necks and heads, a more rhythmical organization of the various figures results. The emphasis on the repetitive shapes of the women's breasts, even greater than in the Ajanta original and copy, establishes the spherical shape pattern upon which the Kirchner painting composition as a whole is based. The Five Bathers marks the precise moment of departure from the Fauve style dominant in Kirchner's painting until this time. The colors chosen, for example, are green, brown, and lavender-pink for the figures-recapitulating the secondary hues which dominate those Ajanta paintings illustrated in color by Griffiths. More muted oranges (browns), greens and violets were to dominate Kirchner's palette in 1912 and 1913,140 largely replacing the pure yellows, reds and blues favored during the years of Van Gogh and Fauve inspiration. In addi- tion the use of small, serrated halftone strokes to supplement the dark contours provides the first occasion when the graphic zig-zag equivalents for modeling are tentatively incorporated into the painting style. These strokes were soon to undergo a morphological transformation from the regularly spaced zig- zags in works from later 1911 (cf. Figs. 67, 71), through the looser "scribble" strokes of 1912 and 1913 (cf. Fig. 72), to culminate in those electric serrations of great amplitude char- acteristic of the Berlin street scenes in 1913 and 1914.141 Al- though the figures in the Five Bathers display several awkward anatomical details142 and are more fully rounded than their Ajanta prototypes, the painting in all other respects presages the new directions of the Berlin style. There are other stylistic and thematic continuities between Kirchner's Ajanta drawings and his early work in Berlin, of which the more important may here be illustrated. From an ex- cellently preserved Ajanta detail in the seventeenth cave- temple (Fig. 65), Kirchner's drawing Lady and Servant (Fig. 66) delineates most carefully the delicate expression and gesture of the noblewoman, who concentrates her attention on a flower held between thumb and second finger. Both her ex- pression and action form the central features of Kirchner's woodcut MUIM-Institute Poster (Fig. 67), though the flower has been moved from her right to her left hand. The poster is datable just before October, 1911, and is the first work of art documentably created after the artist's permanent move to Ber- lin;14a its drawing source is from the middle group of Ajanta copies, executed much earlier in the year in Dresden. Another Ajanta drawing illustrates a girl with umbrella (Fig. 69), although the object in the woman's hand in a detail from the second cave-temple (Fig. 68) is specifically described as a "fly-flap" by Griffiths.44 Once again the Kirchner copy departs from the canon of figure proportions displayed in the prototype, where elongated limbs (with tiny wrists and feet) accentuate the overall attenuation of a figure approaching eight heads in height. The copy instead emphasizes the com- pactly curved contours of shoulders and thighs and shortens the length of torso and extremities to arrive at a more solid and massive figure, narrow-waisted and short-limbed. Thus Kirch- ner's drawing unconsciously reflects the proportions typical of primitive Cameroon sculpture, a bulky figure canon which was to dominate Kirchner's conception well into 1912.145 But the alternative convention of elegant proportions seen in the Ajanta figure already interested Kirchner in late 1910 and 191114" sufficiently to survive the years of African influence and emerge, full blown, as the hallmark of the mature Berlin style. In such 1913 paintings as the well-known Red Nudes (Dr. E. Amstad collection, Zurich) and Nude Coming from the Forest (cf. Fig. 72) there emerge precisely those tubular torsos with elongated extremities first encountered in this and related Indian models. Another Kirchner drawing is based on the fourth of the fe- male figures in the previously discussed Buddhist scene of women and children (Fig. 62). It is the Standing Woman (Fig. 70), in which the classic origins of the Ajanta figure type are most surprisingly intimated. Despite the loss of large surface areas of the prototype figure, Kirchner's drawing here attains a remarkable anatomical unity. Even more than the Indian original, Kirchner's figure embodies a system of animation which, in its parallel positioning of neck and standing leg and in its S-curve of the torso, is certainly Greek and indeed al- most Polyclitan in ultimate origin. But though this brief draw- ing of consummate quality is infused with classic grace and restraint, Kirchner also recapitulates the particular mannerisms of the anonymous Indian painter who was his model: the too spherical breasts, the strangely floating stance, the diminished 140 Most purely exemplified first in Striding into the Sea (Marlborough Fine Art Ltd., London) of the summer of 1912. 141 Particularly the street scenes in the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the Staats- galerie, Stuttgart, and the Sttidtisches Museum, Wuppertal. 142 I.e., the knees of the fourth figure. Note, however, that the abdominal flesh folds in the fifth figure recapitulate those originally used for the first figure in Ajanta. 143 The poster was reproduced several times in Der Sturm, Berlin, beginning in Octo- ber, 1911. Alexei Jawlensky's female portrait type in oil paintings of 1912 is so similar to this woodcut poster as to suggest the influence of Kirchner. 144 Griffiths, 1896, I, 30. 145 See Figs. 67 and 71 of late 1911; 1912 works embodying the compact canon include Striding into the Sea (cf. note 140 above) and the similar lithograph Bathers with Dunes and Lighthouse (Sch. 218), both from Kirchner's second Fehmarn visit during the summer of 1912. 146 In the Chronik K.G. Briicke of 1913 Kirchner wrote (Buchheim, 1956, 104): "In der ersten Ausstellung der N[euen] S[ezession] lernten [Heckel, Kirchner und Schmidt- Rottluff] Mueller kennen. In seinem Atelier fanden sie die Cranachsche Venus, die sie selbst sehr schiitzten, wieder." The exhibition opened in mid-May 1910 (cata- logue, Berlin [May] 1910; Kunstchronik, 21, 1910, 440f.). The influence of Cranach's slightly mannered attenuations of the female figure is felt in Kirchner's Standing</page><page sequence="39">KIRCHNER IN DRESDEN 361 scale of hands and feet, and the expressively obtuse angle be- tween upper and lower right leg. In the final analysis it was to be these latter elements which stimulated his later work in Ber- lin. Thus the Standing Woman's legs and diminutive feet are transformed, in one of Kirchner's most brilliant translations, into the footless pointed legs of the Russian Dancer Mela (Fig. 71), a painting executed in Berlin in late 1911 and now in the Max Zurier collection, Beverly Hills. The anatomically impos- sible but expressive distortion of the right leg in both the Ajanta drawing and the Mela is transferred in 1913 to the po- sitioning of the right arm in the Nude Coming from the Forest in the Derek Jackson collection, Lausanne (Fig. 72); this ob- tuse angle is in turn exaggerated still further in the rendering of the right leg. Although the latter painting was executed in the summer of 1913, one recognizes similarities in the styliza- tions of breasts and shoulders, and in the abbreviated facial features, with drawings created from Indian models more than two years earlier (cf. Figs. 69, 70). In this work, as in others created in Berlin but ultimately traceable to the influ- ence of Ajanta wall-paintings,147 Kirchner was already the master of his mature style. Dickinson College Nude with Hat (Frankfurt, Stidel Museum), a painting similar in format and style to the Heckel portrait (Fig. 44) of late 1910. A less sensuous and more acutely elongated canon makes a brief appearance in a few works from mid-1911, partic- ularly Kirchner's Two Nudes under Trees (known only in an Archive photograph) from the summer of that year. The attenuated nudes here are remarkably similar in their exorbitant verticality and self-contained stasis to the figure in Eve (Frankfurt, Stidel Museum), painted by Nolde in 1910. Nolde records how his Berlin studio became a meeting-place for Briicke artists and others of the New Secession group in 1910 and 1911 (Nolde, 1934, 193-98) and Kirchner is known to have been in Berlin for the week of January 4-11, 1911 from postal-stamps on five postcards in the Altonaer Museum, Hamburg. These isolated examples of figure attenuation have no sequel in Kirchner's paintings until 1913. 147 Two paintings of 1912 that derive in figure-type from Ajanta sources are Seated Dancer; Woman in Evening Dress (known only in an Archive photograph) and Two Bathers on the Shore with Bark (Willy Hahn collection, Stuttgart). The 1912 lithograph Gerda and Erna (Sch. 203) depicts the latter figure in the Oriental po- sition of prayer, crossed legs folded and arms in lap, a motif first appearing in Kirchner's drawing, Seated Woman with Bowl, copied from an Ajanta source (see Appendix II). Freer variations on Ajanta motifs after 1912 are also to be found.</page><page sequence="40">362 The Art Bulletin APPENDIX I: THIRTY-SIX RELIABLY DATED WORKS BY E. L.

The two criteria for their selection were: 1) the presence of an initial "E" in deutsche Schrift (see discussion in text); and 2) visual confirmation that the date was applied with the same instrument as the signature, and with no discernible difference in pressure or direction of stroke. In a very few cases where the simul- taneity of date with signature was deemed doubtful, the works involved are omitted. Mention must be made of several works, also omitted above, which would seem to satisfy the above criteria, but for the presence of two peculiarities: a) the character of the initials "L" and "K" differ clearly from those found on works listed here (particularly the "K," where the vertical and the bent strokes are carefully joined-rather than remaining separate as was normal before mid- 1910; and b) where the date, although demonstrably simultaneous with the signa- ture, is impossible to reconcile with any external or stylistic evidence now avail- able. These signatures, in our opinion, constitute reversions to an approximation of the earlier signature type at some time after June of 1910--thus no longer contemporary to the time of execution of the works involved. The latter include such examples as: Woman Embroidering, oil, Biberach, Julie Kirchner collection, dated "98" (but probably executed in 1905; see note 21 above); Pair of Lovers, drawing in pen and ink, Frankfurt, Karlheinz Gabler collection, dated "03" (but stylistically datable after 1908); and In the Brothel, oil, Diisseldorf, private collec- tion, dated "05" (but stylistically datable about 1912).</page><page sequence="41">KIRCHNER IN DRESDEN 363 Girl Bathing near Iron Stove, drypoint (Sch. 67), impression in Hem- menhofen, Erich Heckel collection.

The drawings are grouped on the basis of the following criteria. Group I: the only drawings to em- ploy pen and ink; unrelated page size. Group II: page size 48.2 x 33.6cm. Group III: page size 43.2 x 33.6cm. Group IV: page size approximately 27.3 x 23.8cm. Group V: page width 27.6cm; page height 33.3-33.7cm. The sequence of the groups is determined on the basis of stylistic development (see discussion above, p. 358). The terminal periods for the entire series of Ajanta copies, autumn, 1910 and spring, 1911, are compatible with all other known external and stylistic evidence, but the dates provided for each group must nevertheless be considered approximate pending documentation of Kirchner's drawing oeuvre. 150 Illustrated in color: green, brown and gray-violet predominant, with beige, black and small areas of muted yellow and blue. 151 "Indische Malerei 1909 kopiert"; 1909 changed to 1904 in pencil. 152 Although this figure appears to possess a halo, Griffiths, 1896, I, 34, interprets the object as a "golden tray . . . behind her head." 153 Illustrated in color: dark browns from rust to near-black predominant, with small areas of white, muted yellow, red and light blue. 154 "Trommelschlagende Frau Adschanta, Vihira I, Ausschnitt." 155 From top to bottom: "griin-gelb," "griin," "griln." 156 "Wandgemilde Adschanta Vihira I, 1.
