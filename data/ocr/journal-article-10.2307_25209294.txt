<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DEVELOPMENT OP EARLY HINDU ICONOGRAPHY The preceding paper appears in response to the abstract which was published in this Journal last year, and in which I invited criticisms of my conclusions. It will be simplest to go over the points the writer raises in the order in which they are made. 1. Two passages are quoted as possibly invalidating my statement that images of the gods did not exist in the period of the Rigveda. As to the first (RV. i, 21. 21), the argument depends on the interpretation of the verb sumbh, which in the active means to "adorn". Thus in RV. viii, 44. 26 : Agnh)i snmbhdmi m?nmabhih, " I adorn Agni with hjnnns " (Saj'ana : onananlyaih stotraih sobhaydmi, " I decorate with estimable praises ") ;</page><page sequence="2">EARLY.HINDU ICONOGRAPHY 593 RV. v, 22. 4: tar\% tvd slomair vardhanty Alrayo, g?rbhih ?umbhanty Atrayah, "so the Atris exalt thee with praises, the Atris adorn thee with songs" (S?yana : stotrair vardhayanti, g?rbhir alamkurvanti). The hymn from which Professor Venkateswara quotes begins by invoking Indra and Agni to come to the sacrifice, to receive praise, and to drink the Soma offering. The stanza in question continues : td yaj??cu pr? ?aipsata, Indr?gn? ?umbhat?, narah, td g?yatr?su g?yata, " these two praise forth at sacrifices, adorn Indra and Agni, O men, to these two sing in G?yatt? measures." * As sumbhata here comes between two verbs meaning " to praise", there can be no doubt that "with praises" must be supplied. It would be extremely far-fetched to make this word to mean " adorn them (i.e. their images) with ornaments ". Even S?yana cannot be supposed to intend this interpretation. He paraphrases ?umbhata by sobhitau kuruta, " make them adorned," adding ndndvidhair alamlcdraih, " with various ornaments," which is parallel to his explanation g?rbhir alamkurvanti quoted above. The second passage occurs in a hymn (viii, 69) addressed to Indra, whose powers of drinking Soma are frequently dwelt upon in the RV. The rendering of stanza 11 here is: "Indra has drunk, Agni has drunk; all the gods have been exhilarated ; let Varuna abide here ; to him the waters have called aloud, as cows that have young to their calves." Then follows the stanza in question (12): "Thou, O Varuna, art a good god, into whose palate (kdkndam) the seven rivers flow as into a hollow (su?irdm) pipe (s?rmy?m)." This is quite a natural parallel to*the drinking powers of Indra, who is elsewhere said to consume three lakes of Soma; and of Varuna, as ruler of the waters, it is said (v, 85, 6) that by his occult power (m?yd)" the rivers swiftly pouring into the ocean do not fill it with water". In the present passage S?yana himself interprets Icdk?dam by tdlum</page><page sequence="3">594 EARLY HINDU ICONOGRAPHY ("palate") as equivalent to "ocean" (samudrdkhyam). I cannot here see any possible reference to images. Perhaps Professor Venkateswara relies on some special meanings attributed to the two words (s?rmi and susira) in the simile.1 Both these words occur in this passage onlj' and consequently have a somewhat doubtful sense. But words with a conjectural meaning must not be used in order to prove a theory of far-reaching importance. Professor Venkateswara rightly surmises that mj' view as to the non-existence of images in the early Vedic period is not founded on 'the lateness of the ?ilpa?dstras. I may add that I do not believe that even the basic principles of those works could possibly go back to a time anterior to the Sutra period. 2. The writer, I think, misunderstands my real meaning, probably because he knows only my abstract, in which general statements have to be made without the qualifica tions and explanations accompanying them in the original article. Thus in the latter I say (p. 159) : " The outward shape of the gods in the RV. thus shows a lack of definiteness and individuality, and references to their form tend to differentiate their personality by the weapons thej' hold in their hands, or the animals that draw their cars, as tokens of identity." In referring (ibid.) to RV. viii, 29, where an attempt is made to individualize several gods without mentioning their names, I point out that predominant activities (such as the three strides of Visnu) are used for this purpose as well as distinctive weapons. There are of course various epithets which are applied in the hymns to one god more thrtn another, or even to one god exclusively, as is fully shown in my Vedic Mythology. But those quoted by Professor Venkateswara 1 I have heard of, though nob seen, a contrivance used in India at the present day, by which water is made to drip from a pot through a brass pipe on to tho top of a litiga (which is a symbol, not an image). Can he have meant this ?</page><page sequence="4">EARLY HINDU ICONOGRAPHY 595 cannot be said to be fortunately chosen. Su?ij)r? is an epithet of Agni, Rudra, and the Ilbhus, as well as of Indra. H?risipra occurs only twice in the RV., both times, indeed, applied to Indra; but so very rare an epithet as "tawny-lipped " is not distinctive, especially when h?ri, " tawny," is an attribute of several gods. Kapardin describes P?san just as often as Rudra. 'Try?mbalca is found only once in the RV., and even then is not explicitly applied to Rudra. There are few epithets so little distinctive of any one deity as darkiUi ; it applies to V?yu only once, but to Agni at least five times, to Usas thrice, to Mitra thrice, to Varuna twice, and to S?rya twice. Ndsatya, it is true, is peculiar to the A?vins, but its meauing (as going back to a prerVedic age) is obscure, and the term certainly does not suggest any physical appearance to the mind. Varuna is only once described as " wearing a golden mantle " ; Savitr is also described as putting on his " golden-coloured mantle "; and Soma is twice said to wear a mantle (drdpi). It may in fact be said that none of these attributes is distinctive in such a way as to present an individuality to the imagination, or to be of use if it were intended to make any particular god recognizable in the form of an image. 3. What I mean is that the elephant is the characteristic V?hana of Indra and is quite sufficient in early sculpture to make him recognizable.1 I have seen such figures in the rock-cut temples, and have photographs of them. Probably no one knows better than I that the vajra is the characteristic weapon of Indra.2 But I have been unable to quote any example of a figure of Indra distinguished by the vajra when he is not seated on his elephant.3 I should be grateful if Professor Venkateswara 1 In the Festschrift, p. 164, n. 4, I point out that even Indra is in quite modern art represented with four arms on his elephant. 2 See my Vedic Mythology, p. 55. 3 In a ruined temple at Dcogarh (Jhansi district) there is a two-armed figure of Indra (c. 700 A.c.) seated on his elephant Aira vat a and holding</page><page sequence="5">596 EARLY HINDU ICONOGRAPHY would give references to such specimens as he knows. In the early Buddhist sculptures Indra is represented as a king, without a vajra.1 The figure of Vajrap?ni, who holds the bolt in his left hand and is so frequently seen accompanying Buddha in the Gandh?ra sculptures, is not Indra.2 Prof essor Venkateswara's statement that " S?rya's seven steeds are not found in the images " is not correct. Several illustrations of sculptures of the Sun-god with his seven horses have been published in Mr. Vincent Smith's History of Fine Art in India (p. 187), in Gopimltha Rao's Elements of Hindu Iconography (plates lxxxviii, Ixxxix), and in the Archaeological Swrvey of May?rahhanja, vol. i (plate facing p. xiv).8 I myself have live photographs of standing figures of S?rya with his seven horses, found in different parts of India4; and a very early example of the Sun-god driving four horses is to be found on one of the rails at Bodh Gaya. When the ligure became stereotyped - with a large expanded lotus held in each of his two hands, the horses might easily disappear as they do in the specimens illustrated in Gangoli's South Indian Bronzes and in several examples of which I have photographs.5 I referred to Gajalaksmi because that form of the goddess is the earliest represented iconographically, appearing no fewer than ten times on the gateways of S?nchi (c. 150 B.c.). The other forms of Laksmi I believe n vajra in his right hand as well ; seeGopin?tha Rao's Elements of Hindu Iconography, pi. xxxii, pp. 111-12. I possess four photographs of different sculptured figures of Indra seated on his elephant. 1 See Vincent Smith, A History of Fine Art in India and Ceylon, fig. li, p. S3 ; fig. 60, p. 109. 2 Op. cit., p. 106 f. 3 Op. cit., p. 187; Gopinfitha Rao's Elements of Hindu Iconography, pis. lxxxviii, lxxxix ; Arch ological Survey of Mayfirabhanja, vol. i, plate facing p. xix. 4 At Ellora, Patna, and Koimrak. ? One of these, found at Hazaribagh, is even a seated figure, with nothing to identify the god beyond the two lotuses.</page><page sequence="6">EARLY HINDU ICONOGRAPHY 597 to be later developments from this prototype with the elephants left out, when the figure of the goddess, seated on a lotus throne and holding a lotus in her hand, had been sufficiently conventionalized, much in the same way as S?rya appears without his steeds. This type of LaksmI is constantly found on the reverse of Gupta coins for a period of two centuries (385-530 A.c.).1 In these she is represented with two arms,2 generalljr seated on a lotus and with a lotus in her left hand. On the coins of Oaa?i?ka, king of Ganda (c. 600-625 A.c.), the two elephants, on a very small scale, reappear on each side above the two-armed figure of LaksmI seated on a lotus and holding a lotus in her left hand.3 As to Gauri and Parvati being represented with two hands even when they have no V?hana, I have expressly stated that wives of gods appear with only two arms when they are represented beside their spouses,4 because their identity is then clear. I have a photograph of a two-armed figure of Parvati, represented by herself and seated on a tiger as a V?hana,5 as well as of other goddesses identifiable b\r the V?hanas of their respective spouses.0 Ardhaimrisvara is so distinctive a figure that both V?hana and additional hands to hold symbols of identification were quite superfluous. 4. When I spoke of Visnu appearing with eight arms from the eighth century onwards, I had no time to collect evidence beyond what was known to me at the moment 1 Allan, Catalogue of the Coins of the Gupta Dynasties, London, 1014. 2 In the Festschrift, p. 162, n. 2, I note that Padm?-Laksm? appears with four arms, and p. 164, n. 7, that she is thus depicted hy modern Hindu artists. :* Allan, Catalogue of the Coins of the Gupta Dynasties, p. 147 f. 4 PcrhapH this assertion may require modification. ft I have two others from Bodh Gaya in which a two-armed P?rvat? is seated beside a four-armed Siva, with Siva's foot resting on a hull and Piirvati's on a tiger, represented below. 0 Thus, in a photograph I have Indranl (two-armed) is seated on an elephant (Cuttack district).</page><page sequence="7">598 EARLY HINDU ICONOGRAPHY of writing. Professor Venkateswara's reference to the eight-armed figure of Trivikrama at B?daini and to Var?hamihira's description of an eight-armed image of Visnu now enables us definitely to say that eight-armed figures occur at least as early as 600 A.C. He next points out that a two-armed image of Subrahmanya at Tanjore has no V?hana. Having no knowledge of the details of this sculpture (though I probably saw it when I visited Tanjore), I am unable to say anything definite about it. But as it dates from a late period the-figure is probably so conventionalized as not to require a means of identification that would have been necessary in early representations of this.deit)'. I do not know what particular significance Professor Venkateswara attaches to the eight arms of Durg? and the four of P?rvat? at Ellora, but it cannot at least have anything to do with the increase of four arms to eight, because that development had, as his own evidence shows, aireadj' been arrived at by 600 A.c. at the latest. The fact that Laksmi (presumably not Gaja-laksmi) is two-handed at Ellora and is sq described by Henmdri (thirteenth century) seems to me only to emphasize the persistence of one of the distinctive features of the original type of this goddess. 5. What I mean is simply that four arms were introduced (in the second half of the first century A.c.) into Hindu iconographj? later than two, and eight arms (before 600 A.c.) later than four. When the practice of representing gods with many arms had once been established, image-makers had a good deal of latitude in choosing the number, as is indeed shown by the instructions given in the technical treatises. Thus, four armed or even two-armed images may belong to a later period than those with eight arms, not only in different parts of India but also in the same part. I am uncertain what value as evidence Professor</page><page sequence="8">EARLY HINDU ICONOGRAPHY 599 Venkateswara attaches to the " information " supplied by the Pur?nas with regard to previous cosmic ages ; but the statement, of the Gane?a Pur?iia that in the Kali (i.e. the present) age Gane?a has two hands is in manifest conflict with the existing images of Gane?a. When so late and obscure a work as the Surj-a Upanisad states that Surya has four arms, that statement can hardly be considered to have any value when it contradicts all the concrete evidence of actual images. As Professor Venkateswara does not quote the words of the Upanisad I am uncertain whether he means to say that that work also describes the two natural hands as holding the lotuses, while the two added ones exhibit the abhaya and varada poses. Such a statement would conflict with my assertion that when there are four hands it is the natural ones that are employed in any action or pose, while the added ones then hold the distinctive symbols of the deity. I have adduced as an argument in support of my theory that the additional arms were primarily introduced for the purpose of holding sjTmbols of identification. This view is abundantly illustrated in Gangoly's South Indian Bronzes and in Gopin?tha Rao's Elements. If my generalization is incorrect I hope Professor Venkateswara will bring forward early instances to the contrary. As to Sfirya holding a lotus in each of his two hands and not weapons, my summary was not meant to impljr that the symbols of identification must necessarily be weapons, but only something equally suitable for the purpose. There is in the RV. no suggestion of any weapon distinctive of S?rya. When this deity came to be represented in sculpture no more graphic symbol could have been chosen than two fully expanded lotuses, which, like sunflowers, resemble the solar disc. 6. The Bhagavadgitd, as its date is quite uncertain, cannot be used as evidence of the earljr existence of the</page><page sequence="9">coo EARLY HINDU ICONOGRAPHY notion of- four-armed gods. Far from being an integral part even of the late form of the Mahdbhdrata, it is not even an archaic narrative episode, but an independent philosophical poem, bearing various signs of lateness, which came to be only loosely connected with the great epic. I certainly do not see any reason to believe that it was composed till some centuries after the introduction of four arms into Hindu iconography. 7. I should say that the normal V?hana of Visiiu is Garuda. But the serpent Sesa is of course characteristic of him also; and recumbent figures of Visnu with four arms tying on Sesa occur several times. But, according to Gopin?tha Rao1 this image should have only two hands, and one of the earliest known examples, that at Mah?balipur,2 has only two, and this feature has persisted down to the present day.3 My view is that the motive of distinctiveness in giving an image four arms was present only in the early stage of Hindu iconography, but that when in the course of time Visnu came to be regarded as the characteristically four-armed (catur-bhuja) god, this feature was increasingly introduced even when unnecessary, A similar process took place in the case of other gods also. Thus, I have a photograph of a late image of Skanda in which he appears with six heads and twelve arms, though seated on his V?hana the peacock ; while the same deity is represented with two arms only seated on his peacock on coins of Kum?ragupta (414-55 A.c.).4 8. I certainly take the epithets vi?v?to-mukha and visv?tO'bdha, used in RV. x, 81, 3, of Vi?vakarma, to be oii the same level as sahdsra-??r?d and sah?sra-pdd applied to Purusa in x, 90, that is to say, to be figurative expressions. Vi?v?to-mukha could easily have been applied iconographically to express " looking in all directions", 1 Elements of Hindu Iconography, p. 90. 2 Op. cit., pi. xxxi. 5 Op. cit., pi. xxix. 4 See Allan, Catalogue of the Coins of the Gupta Dynasties, pp. 84-6.</page><page sequence="10">EARLY HINDU ICONOGRAPHY 601 that is, towards all four points of the compass.1 But it is obvious that the expressions " thousand-headed " and "thousand-footed," as well as "thousand-eyed",2 could not be represented in sculpture. When in the RV. Agni is incidentally said to have three heads, this is a figurative allusion to his burning on three altars.3 I do not know on what evidence Professor Venkateswara bases his statement that Agni is also said to have two heads and seven hands in the RV., as he gives no references.4 As to ?iva,I mention in the original article5 that some of the Ko?as give panc?nana and paficamukha among his epithets, and add, " he seems never to be represented thus in actual literature or in sculpture/' but "modern Hindu artists sometimes represent him with five heads". I have been unable to find evidence of his appearing thus in early sculpture.0 Professor Vogel wrote to me last year to say that he had met with five-headed images of Siva at Mondi in the Bias Valley, but he did not think they were very ancient. This information and Professor Venkateswaras references to the Skanda pnrdna, etc., show that my remark about Siva seeming never to be represented as "five - faced" in actual literature or in sculpture cannot be upheld. 9. My point about the outward form of the gods when 1 See Festschrift, p. 167, n. 1, where it is pointed out that in the Bhdgavata Purdna the epithet catur-mukha is explained with reference to the points of the compass. 3 Applied to Indra and Agni in the RV. and to Rudra in tho VS. 3 Cf. his epithet (vii, 3. 1) tdpur-mfirdhan, "having a burning head." 4 When Agni is said in tho RV. to have two births {dvijdnman) and two mother-parents {dvimdtr), the allusion is to his production from the two kindling sticks {ardnls), and his epithet "seven-rayed" {septdrasmi) refers to the conventional number of his tongues or llames ; cf. Vedic Mytholoejy, pp. 89, 93. 8 Festschrift, p. 163, n. 2. 0 In tho earliest inscribed statue (a.D. 458) of Siva, found at Ko.sam, Allahabad, that god (as well as P?rvat? who stands beside him) has one head and two arms.</page><page sequence="11">602 EARLY HINDU ICONOGRAPHY Nala meets them is that they evidently have the normal human shape because they are not recognized by him as gods till they explain who they are. There is no question here of their changing their appearance before he sees them ; thej' arc said to use their power of assuming any shape only when they make themselves exactly like Nala in order to prevent Damayanti from recognizing him. When they resume their own shapes in answer to her prayer, they appear before her with the six characteristic marks of the gods which are enumerated. But not a word is said about their having more than two arms or any other physical feature not to be found in the normal human shape. From the above remarks it is clear that Professor Venkateswara s criticism corrects some of my statements on points of detail. But it has not, in my opinion, invalidated any of the main conclusions, which are the following:? 1. In the earlier Vedic period the gods were conceived as vaguely anthropomorphic in outward shape, and were not j^et iconographically represented. 2. Images of the gods began to be made in the latest Vedic period, from about the fourth century u.c. 3. From about the middle of the first century A.c. gods begin to be represented with four arms on Indian coins. 4. Bjr 600 A.c. the number of arms in some deities is increased to six and eight, and by the eighth century to sixteen. 5. In the earliest period of Hindu iconography an additional pair of arms was introduced to hold symbols for the purpose of differentiating deities when they could not be identified by other means.1 A. A. Macdonell. 1 In a letter dated April 17, 1910, Professor Vogel wrote to me that he agreed with my main conclusions as stated in my article on "The Development of Early Hindu Iconography" in the Festschrift Ernst )Vindisch.</page></plain_text>
