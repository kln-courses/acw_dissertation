The Death of Nature merits recognition as an epic work in the history of science. It is easily the most significant effort since T. S. Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions. However, Kuhn fashioned his multi-definitional paradigm from somewhat restricted his- torical and biographical sense of the assumptions of natural science truth-makers. Mer- chant's social history evidences a broader command of the milieux of science - a com- mand that features the interconnections of political economy, literature, and art. While the author does not leave us with a heuristic concept on the order of the paradigm, she does provide compelling support for the contention that knowledge is context-bound. Merchant's stated intention is to "examine the images of women and nature as they relate to the formation of the modern world." However, those who sense that she zeal- ously holds the assumptions of philosophical idealism would strongly err. Her treatment of imagery gives due credit to a structural materialist conception of history. For this rea- son the inclusion of the "scientific revolution" in the subtitle leaves a somewhat faulty impression that scientism (or a technological-determinism variety thereof) is the "villain." Rather, science and its sometimes exploitative applications are placed in the larger con- stellation of commercial/mercantile capitalism. Methodologically, Merchant employs a dialectic sense of male-female metaphors set against the backdrop of struggles against social hierarchy. Sociologists of knowledge</page><page sequence="2">404 Social Science Quarterly should be intrigued by her iconographie method, which is similar to that employed by Philippe Arie in his Centuries of Childhood. For example, she contrasts such art as Cranach's The Nymph of Spring and de Bry's engraving of the "female soul of the, world" with the frontispiece to Thomas Hobbes's Leviathan. Both dialectic and iconogra- phy combine to reveal how the organic view of the cosmos succumbed to the mechanis- tic imagery of a science bound to a rapidly developing European market system. Centering her explanations in an "earth's eye view" of history, the author explores how gender imagery has both reflected and guided ecological thought and practice. Thus, the theoretical nexus is a metaphorical shift whereby the nurturing vision of "Dame Nature" fell to the antithetical Weltanschauung of a clock-precise universe. The Death of Nature features a wide-ranging review of philosophy, art and literature - from Aristotelian functionalism to Seneca's and da Vinci's anthropomorphic organicism; from Pliny's natural history and its prohibition on mining to Native American preserva- tionist values. All are bound together by the metaphor of nature as female. Certain of these early descriptions underscore the natural inferiority of the passive feminine earth (Artistotle) that yields its bounty only through impregnation by the masculine sun. Yet all held the earth as living, generating, and sustaining, and thus worthy of human rever- ence. Between 1500 and 1700, the mechanistic imagery of a positivist and empirical sci- ence began to mark European thought. Merchant quite convincingly ties this new vision to the imperative of the expanding market economy. The earth's resources were re- quired to fuel growth, expansion, trade, and industry. For positive science, nature's disor- der necessitated order, "her" chaos presaged control, and that which was wild was to be tamed. Merchant argues that the mastery of women coincided with the mastery of nature in European society. Women were increasingly restricted, not only in production, but in re- production. Under feudalism, noblewomen managed property and estate affairs, urban women worked in the crafts and owned shops, while peasant women were central to farm labor. These roles gave ground to the bourgeois ideal of the domestic and leisured wife and a degraded wage earner status for women of the working classes. Even mid- wives and their art yielded to inexperienced surgeons and their forceps. The exemplar of mechanistic imagery appears to be Sir Francis Bacon, protégé and attorney general of James I. (James's book Daemonologie [1597] stands as a classic on the persecution of witches. In it he argued that women were twenty times more likely than men to be witches due to their curiosity, thirst for vengeance, and greed.) Bacon referred to nature as a female, arguing that she must be enslaved, shaped, and molded by the mechanical arts (technology). Merchant argues compellingly that Bacon's . interro- gation of witches and his support for the inquisition of nature share a common meta- phorical base. This is further evidenced in his Utopian New Atlantis in which the scien- tist/father is enshrined at the top of a patriarchal society founded on environmental control. Perhaps chapters 9 and 10 are the richest. In these the author first draws firm con- nections between the machine principles of European economic life and the assump- tions of positive science. She follows with the logical emergence of a managerial ethic basic to the exploitation of environmental resources. These set the stage for a conclud- ing provocative argument: that the atomized, control-oriented procedures of positivistic science are inadequate to comprehend and preserve the ecosystem. Merchant at times weaves a somewhat tangled tapestry of happenings and imagery. Those expecting clear and compelling logical connections between structure and cul- ture, events and ideas, matter and metaphor, may be disappointed. To be sure, there is no precise time line of demarcation between the two suggested epochs of metaphorical history. The author makes it clear, for example, that the natural vision did not ensure egalitarianism for the sexes prior to the sixteenth century. Nor did such a view spare English forests and soil from depletion at the hands of landlords in the early middle ages. Consequently, readers with strong Comtean assumptions may fault this ambitious effort. However, that is only as it should be. Merchant avoids historicism; however, she</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 405 realizes that the nuances of history seldom correspond to Kepler's clockwork vision of the cosmos, or the laboratory certainty of positive science.
