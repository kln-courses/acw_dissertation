PP. X1X, 1203. FEDERAL EXPENDITURE POLICY FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH AND STABILITY, Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Fiscal Policy, Joint Economic Committee, 85th Congress, lst Session, 1957, pp. xi, 663. ON November 5, 1957, the Joint Economic Committee published ninety-seven papers which had been submitted at the invitation of its Subcommittee on Fiscal Policy. On Novem- ber 18 the subcommittee opened hearings at- tended by those who had previously sub- mitted papers. Approximately ninety of the authors appeared at these hearings, which continued through November 27. Each hear- ing lasted from two to three hours. The con- * The author is very much indebted to Paul H.

This considerable effort was organized by the Staff Economist for the Joint Economic Committee, Norman B. Ture. The Joint Economic Committee organized a similar project in the field of federal taxa- tion two years ago. At that time, a Subcom- mittee on Tax Policy assembled an impressive group of papers and organized the contribu- tors into a series of panel discussions for ex- amination of specific federal tax problems. These efforts were generally well received in- side and outside the Congress, and the Joint Economic Committee evidently was embold- ened to attempt a similar venture on federal expenditures. The topics covered fall into three general groups. The first consists of an examination of the historical development of federal expendi- tures. The second group might be called "gen- eral theory," the topics including: (1) consid- erations in determining government func- tions, (2) the level of government at which</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 341 public functions are performed, (3) economy and efficiency in government expenditures, (4) federal expenditures and economic growth, (5) federal expenditures and economic stabil- ity, and (6) procedures for determining fed- eral spending programs. The third group of topics centers on specific areas of federal ex- penditures: (i) national security, (2) foreign aid, (3) natural resources development, (4) re- gional development, (5) housing and urban redevelopment, (6) human resources, (7) trans- portation, (8) research and development. The approach is fundamentally academic; almost all the participants are economists, and public finance economists at that. There are a few panelists from the staffs of the major interest groups, such as the National Association of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Com- merce, and the AFL-CIO. Very few of the papers were contributed by government econ- omists, none of whom appeared as panelists. "Determining the Proper Role of Government" T HE objectives of this considerable effort are broad and a little vague. Congressman Wilbur D. Mills, chairman of the subcommit- tee, in the introduction to the published pa- pers, points out that the study is related to the stabilization and growth objectives of the Em- ployment Act. In opening the hearings, he said, "We are seeking economic facts and analysis on the basis of which broad guide- lines can be developed to assist in the formu- lation of future Federal expenditure policy." (p. 1) The subcommittee was concerned, Mr. Mills said, ". . . with economic principles which are basic to determining the proper role of government in the setting of a private enterprise economy." (p. 1) He expressed the hope that looking at expenditure programs in a context of growth and stability, rather than in terms of more immediate objectives, might provide fresh insights and that this study might suggest opportunities for reducing the level of federal outlay or changing the compo- sition of federal expenditures in ways which would better contribute to progress in the private sector of the economy. These broad objectives in no way detract from the usefulness of the papers as submitted and published, but the hearings inevitably have a certain indecisive character. Although the subcommittee presumably was interested in that timeless epoch known as "the long run," two short-run events unhappily had in- truded. Between the time the papers were written and the time they were published the Russians had put the first Sputnik in orbit. And, by November, 1957, it was evident that the American economy was in the midst of its third postwar recession. Both the subcommit- tee and the panelists found it difficult to con- centrate on broad impacts on economic growth and stability without reference to these more immediate events. Before adopting a critical tone, I should stress that these volumes are an important ad- dition to the literature of public finance. On the fact-gathering side alone, the contribution is magnificent. University students of govern- ment affairs undoubtedly will read this ma- terial. A Theory of Public Expenditures URING the last three or four years, public LI finance economists have spent a good deal of time and energy in the elaboration of a theory of public expenditures. These re- cent efforts have not been in any sense revolu- tionary; they are grounded firmly in tradi- tional thinking and, in fact, their theoretical underpinnings go back to the theory of mar- ginal utility. This notion, as any school boy will remember, states that if one has eaten five apples, the sixth doesn't taste as good. The recent contributions to a theory of public expenditure seem to have been touched off by an essay by Paul A. Samuelson in 1954, which depended heavily on the possi- bilities of making direct comparisons between private and public economic activity.' Many of the papers submitted by the panelists re- flect this approach and elaborate and contrib- ute to it. Richard A. Musgrave's paper will serve as a starting point for a description of the theory. His approach is shared, to a con- siderable extent, by the other panelists who are concerned with expenditure theory. To quote directly: I"The Pure Theory of Public Expenditure," 36 Re- view of Economics and Statistics 387 (November, 1954).</page><page sequence="3">342 PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REVIEW The budgetary activity of the Government is needed because the pricing system of the market cannot deal with all the tasks that must be met in order to operate a sound economy and a healthy society. ... [It is] ... useful to distinguish be- tween three major functions of budget policy, in- cluding- 1. The provision for social wants, which requires the Government to impose taxes and make expend- itures for goods and services, to be supplied free of direct charge to the consumer; 2. The application of certain corrections to the distribution of income as determined in the mar- ket requiring the Government to add to the in- come of some by transfers while reducing the in- come of others by taxes; and 3. The use of budget policy for purposes of economic stabilization, rendering it necessary un- der some conditions to raise the level of demand by a deficit policy and under others to curtail de- mand by a surplus policy. (p. io8) These functions or budget components can be separated for analytical purposes, and any desired combination can be chosen. For ex- ample, it is possible to have a small budget function for services but a large budget func- tion for income transfer purposes. Musgrave suggests (p. 114) that these components might be measured separately and then tabulated as a net budget to show the separate effects of taxes, transfers, and outlays for goods and services in relation to the total of the three budget functions. As for social wants, The basic problem . . . arises because their satis- faction, by their very nature, requires that the goods and services in question must be consumed in equal amounts by all. (p. 0og) . . . the basic process is one of transforming indi- vidual preferences into social wants. (p. 1 0o) Decisions about the size of the public sector and the size of particular public programs are difficult because voters are unable to signal their preferences. Everyone benefits from gov- ernment services whether he contributes a little or a lot. The taxpayer knows he cannot be excluded and, therefore, he will become disputatious about how much he is required to contribute to the support of the service. The rational citizen-taxpayer . . . votes for the level of public expenditures where the satisfactions created through Govern- ment by the outlay which necessarily accompanies the last dollar in personal taxes equal the satisfac- tions he would have secured from a dollar of pri- vate expenditure. He equalizes at the margin the satisfactions secured from alternative avenues of expenditure. (Thomson, p. 151) Whether government should produce goods and services-socially beneficial ones, public goods, or other goods-is simply a question of whether gov- ernmental organization of production will result in a given amount being produced at a lower cost than would be achieved by private producers. (Brownlee, p. 225) The government should value resources at their opportunity cost in the private sector and utilize market information wherever pos- sible to ascertain the value of such resources in alternative uses. It is pointed out that there are some areas in which, because of special circumstances, the public sector must join with the private sector in the control of resources. These include the cases where social benefits extend beyond those immediately accruing to individuals, as with public education. Government interven- tion may also be required to assess properly indirect costs, as in the classic case of smoke control. In some instances, government, for technical reasons, may organize a service as a monopoly, as with the Post Office, and there may be cases like streets and sidewalks pro- vided by government as a common service be- cause of the difficulty in selling or metering the use of such facilities. The principles governing public demand are in large part the same as those governing private demand. Much of what the study of consumer demand in the private economy has taught us about people's private behavior is also applicable to their com- munal behavior. (Soloway, p. 24) This, in a general way, as set forth in these volumes, is the prevailing economic theory of public expenditures. There can be little quar- rel with the framework suggested for analyz- ing the redistributive and stabilization func- tions of government. But the approach to the determination of social wants is another mat- ter. The foregoing conceptual scheme encour- ages a way of looking at government activity that gives rise to consequences that may be un-</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS intended and in some cases are denied by the authors of the theory.2 The first consequence is that this concep- tual framework centers attention on the pri- vate sector, on the private control of resources, and on private pricing. Market allocation of resources is accepted implicitly as superior to public (political) allocation of resources, and the valuation placed on resources in private use implicity controls valuations for public purposes. The public sector, in this view, is judged by its support for and strengthening of the private sector and private markets; market prices and market allocations take on an aura of the absolute. It is forgotten somehow that the market is a social institution, organized for social purposes. Indeed, this approach al- most seems to suggest that the market itself- not the administrators of business firms-makes decisions about resource allocation-a sort of anthropomorphic view of private economic activity. That which has been lost from view is an appreciation of something akin to the old- fashioned notion of sovereignty. A modern democratic government expresses a public purpose and a public interest which is quanti- tatively, and perhaps qualitatively, greater than private interests. The sovereignty of gov- ernment is on a different plane than the "sov- ereign consumer."3 The second consequence of this approach, closely linked with the first, is that if the mar- ket is the starting point and the guideline for resource allocation, the importance of public activities necessarily will be limited. This con- sequence is not appreciated by most of the ad- herents of the theory who feel that their ap- proach is neutral with respect to the valua- tions placed on private and on public goods. The difficulty arises in efforts to "maximize the value of output minus costs." This sounds like an objective standard for the determina- tion of priorities between the public and the private sector. But, in fact, the standard can- not be applied to public goods. For private goods the measurements of net profitability 2See, for example, Musgrave's conclusion about the efficiency of satisfying social wants. (Papers, p. 115) 8"You are the king in the Land of Brands," as sloganized by advertisers, is an extremist expression of a market-dominated concept of private sovereignty. are always possible and in a market-domi- nated economy the primacy of these measure- ments always will be emphasized. If the formal maximization criterion is neutral as between public and private goods, then it can- not be quantified and has no significance for policy decisions. If it can be supported by measurements, its neutrality is lost because net profitability will inevitably be under- stated for public activities; these are not un- dertaken for profit but for other considera- tions. The undervaluation of public goods is ev- erywhere evident. As Galbraith has pointed out brilliantly in his recent book, The Afflu- ent Society,4 we are so happy to keep resources profitably and fully employed in the private sector that we shamefully neglect the social consequences of our private economic actions. We spend a billion dollars a year retooling the automobile industry for new models, for which a market must be found by inducing consumers to regard last year's car as obsoles- cent. Then we drive our new Cadillac through slums and past dilapidated school buildings. The pressing problem of public finance in the year 1958 is that there isn't enough of it. There are very many areas where the federal government could spend additional funds in a productive fashion, and there are certainly places where state and local governments could allocate additional resources to alleviate some urban and rural blight. It is reasonable to sup- pose that additional outlays here might pro- duce increasing, not diminishing, utilities. The events of the past year, with a Detroit re- cession and the post-Sputnik concern with education, suggest that our society is in more danger of undervaluing than overvaluing the resources that are devoted to public purposes. Too many of our private dollars are dedicated to "marginal" uses, to a repackaging of every- thing from food to the female figure. A few of the panelists are aware of the dan- ger of overvaluing private goods: There is a lot of chrome, to use the language of the day, in our private economy and private ex- penditures. (Barkin, Hearings, p. 6i) The basic challenge is, therefore, not to distin- 4John Kenneth Galbraith, The Affluent Society (Houghton Mifflin Co., 1958).</page><page sequence="5">344 PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REVIEW guish between public and private goods but to de- termine the effectiveness of the operation of the private society and economy. . . . (Barkin, Pa- pers, p. 91) [The economist] . . . can perform the valuable service of identifying those deficiencies in the mar- ket mechanism and those inherent economic char- acteristics of government which make it eco- nomically advantageous to have certain services provided by government rather than by private initiative. In other words he can show where gov- ernment intervention in resource allocation and use promises a greater return per unit of input than untrammeled private use. (Heller, Papers, p. 103) It is interesting to speculate as to why, in a time when our society needs more public fi- nance, the majority of economists should sup- port a theory which would lead to less public finance. If our national concern over juvenile delinquency, schools, urban blight, and scien- tific education is to be taken as more than a wringing of hands, we are very much in need of a theory of public expenditure which will rationalize these concerns and contribute to a solution of our most critical public problems. Economists thus far have failed to provide such a theory. This recent emphasis on a market-oriented theory of the public sector can be explained partially in terms of the patterns of thinking that economists have developed in the past twenty years. In these years, economics and economists have done well in their suggestions for the solution of problems of public and private resource allocation. This success has been matched by a discernible improvement in the prestige of the profession. The reason for this is not hard to find: economists have been able to quantify their basic data. Na- tional income accounting is the most dramatic development, but there have been other sig- nificant techniques devised by the profession. Input-output analysis and linear programing are useful and merchantable commodities. The economist finds a particularly useful role when he is able to measure with preci- sion. But in the public sector, such measure- ments are seldom possible. Here the subject material is non-quantifiable political plural- ism, at which economists almost instinctively rebel. If there is an economists' view of the political process, it is that allocation of re- sources by this process is irrational, inefficient, and wasteful, i.e., "uneconomic."5 The efforts of economists to bring in con- structs from the private sector in the hope that they will be of equal usefulness in the public sector also may be explained-in part- as a seemingly natural drive of social scientists to generalize. Similarly, sociologists, for ex- ample, are groping for a general field theory of social behavior. But overbroad generaliza- tions and conceptual structures that attempt to embrace both public and private activity are misleading and become useless in applica- tion to reality. This prevailing general theory of public ex- penditures, as fashioned by economists, is of little use to public administrators or legisla- tors who are faced with decision-making in the public sector. Perhaps the major difficulty is that the theory starts at the wrong place. It starts with the consumer or the voter or the citizen or some similar discrete and abstract economic particle. This particle is built into an aggregate of particles: the sum total of in- dividual demands in the market is an aggre- gate market demand curve. But the starting point for the decision- maker in the public sector is not the individ- ual voter-citizen-taxpayer-consumer; the start- ing point here is organization. The prefer- ences which must be recorded and measured are those of political parties, producers' groups, trade unions, chambers of commerce, manu- facturers' associations, organized teachers, and organized parents. These are the utilities which must be analyzed, and these are the val- ues which must be balanced. Government goods and services are not consumed equally by all; the economic essence of government programs is their differential character. Some people win and some people lose, and some groups are made better off, and others, at least relatively, are made worse off. The presi- 6 An interesting attempt to apply concepts of optimi- zation to the political process is Anthony Downs, An Economic Theory of Democracy (Harper &amp; Brothers, 1957) esp. pp. 164-204. Downs concludes that vote maximization by political leaders always results in a less than optimum utilization of an economy's re- sources. He finds, however, that both "private plan- ning agents" and "government" are "perfectly ra- tional."</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS 345 dent of Inter-Stellar Ballistic Missiles, Inc. benefits more from national defense expendi- tures than does T. C. Mits, draftee. And the purposes served by government budgets are completely intertwined. The satis- faction of collective wants may also stabilize levels of economic activity. The satisfaction of collective wants may also redistribute income in accordance not with societal views but with the views of an economic minority. A work- able framework for examining the economics of public finance must start with the reality of organization, public and private, and with the needs and capacities of groups and factions. What then can the economist contribute to an improvement in decisions about public ex- penditures? Not general guide lines for choices about the size of the public sector or choices among alternative government pro- grams-yet. He can, however, describe, with reasonable accuracy, the volume of total ex- penditure needed to keep resources adequately employed. Beyond this, economists can ana- lyze the specific kinds of consequences which may be expected to flow from specific kinds of government expenditures. An economist should be able to provide a reasonable ap- praisal of the economic effects of an urban re- development program or to project, with rea- sonable accuracy, the effects of an increase in the price support program for corn. But there is simply no way by which the benefits from ex- penditures on urban redevelopment can be compared with benefits from expenditures on price supports for corn. The best of all maxims about public finance is the nineteenth-century British one that "Expenditure depends upon policy." The full meaning of this is that there can be no general theory of public expenditure divorced from the political, social, and economic objectives of a government. Federal Expenditures for Specific Programs A DMINISTRATORS, executives, and legislators are likely to find little comfort and inspi- ration in the prevalent economic theory of public expenditures for there the public deci- sion-maker has a different frame of reference than the economist. But the problems of com- munication and the differences in concept be- tween academic economists and public deci- sion-makers are not a barrier in the study of specific programs. These papers and hearings are of particular usefulness to practitioners who need general background in a program field or are looking for a careful reading of historical experience or for an analysis of the consequences of particular government out- lays. The papers assembled around particular topics are, at minimum, informative; some of the contributions are outstanding in their in- sights. The papers in specific areas are generally straightforward, nontheoretical recitals of ex- perience and problems. Again, these are writ- ten from the standpoint of the economist. There is no effort here to analyze patterns of political behavior as applied to program areas or to investigate the role of political parties in the formulation of expenditure policy or to examine the part played by interest groups in shaping and modifying expenditure patterns. Neither is there a discussion of the procedures and organizational patterns used for the im- plementation of specific expenditure programs. While this reviewer cannot comment with assured competence on each of the groups of papers it might be useful to point out those which seem of outstanding value. Some of the best papers are those on federal expenditures for the development of human resources- health, education, and social security. The papers on education are a cut above the kind of generalizing that has been current in this field in recent months. The papers on natural resources development are similarly excep- tional. The latter include an examination of techniques used for the evaluation of re- source development projects together with three excellent papers on atomic energy. The papers on foreign aid likewise come to grips with some of the difficult issues in this field. On the other hand, the papers on expendi- tures for national security are handicapped by lack of access to the kinds of data which are necessary for an accurate appraisal of the eco- nomic and program effects of these outlays. In this field, where politics and economics are so firmly intertwined, most of the contributors make an unfortunate effort to effect a separa- tion. The group of papers on procedures in federal spending programs contains significant</page><page sequence="7">346 PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REVIEW individual contributions but neglects to deal with such recent developments as cost-type budgets, nonbudgetary financing, and recent alterations in the activities of government cor- porations. Also omitted is any discussion of the procedural aspects of budgeting within the administration or within the Congress. It should be hastily pointed out, however, that the scope of the papers and hearings is already broad and some stopping point had to be found. Unfortunately, the stopping point was somewhat short of areas which would be of particular interest to students of public ad- ministration. It is not possible to delineate any common thread of concern in the papers on specific program areas. These volumes do not reveal, for example, four or five basic conflicts per- meating all of the considerations relevant to federal expenditures. Insofar as it is possible to single out any one general area of concern, it is with federal-state-local fiscal relations. By no means all of the participants deal directly or even indirectly with this point, but in a great many papers, explicitly or implicitly, fis- cal federalism is at issue. We have not, of course, made very much progress in this area, in spite of the work of the Second Hoover Commission and the Kestnbaum Commission.6 The year-old Presi- dent's committee, coming so hard on the heels of the Kestnbaum Commission, testifies to the ever-present difficulties. Somehow our governmental structure has come to be fiscally unbalanced. The resources available to the federal government vastly ex- ceed those available to state and local govern- ments. Their relatively inelastic sources of revenue leave them at the mercy of aggrieved taxpayers so that an increase in resources here must come by way of increased tax rates. The rising price levels of the past fifteen years have not impoverished the federal government, but state and local governments have felt the im- pact and felt it adversely. Taxpayers who are injured by the inflationary process can bring their pressures to bear effectively in holding down local tax rates. The recent increases in " U. S. Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, A Report to the President for Transmittal to the Con- gress (U. S. Government Printing Office, 1955). state and local expenditures have been made in the face of formidable difficulties, and it is not reasonable to suppose that these units can continue to strengthen the quantity and qual- ity of community services in the face of such odds. Ingenuity and invention will be re- quired to refurbish the financial structure of governments below the federal level. We will be fortunate if we find some way out of this financial imbalance in the next decade or two. This is the fiscal calamity of our time (a phrase which Harold Somers sug- gests, in the interests of economy, be short- ened to "fiscalamity," Hearings, p. 201). The contributors grapple with this difficulty, some- times in terms of a grandiloquent and mean- ingless cliche, ". . . If we give each govern- mental activity to the smallest governmental unit which can efficiently perform it, there will be a vast resurgence and revitalization of local government in America." (Stigler, Pa- pers, P. 219) Sometimes the clear and resound- ing phrases give way to a serious effort to deal with the specifics. The papers on housing and urban redevelopment and transportation, for example, face up clearly to the necessity for channeling more resources into metropolitan areas if economic growth is to be assured. The Joint Economic Committee rjiHE Joint Economic Committee, originally I called "The Joint Committee on the Eco- nomic Report," was called into existence by the Employment Act of 1946. The committee was then an innovation in congressional staff- ing and should still be regarded as something of an experiments It was given statutory au- thority to report on the President's Economic Report and has held hearings each year at which government and nongovernment wit- nesses give their comments on the Economic Report and their own views of the economic state of the nation. The Joint Economic Com- mittee is a staff agency of the Congress in the sense that professional economists are made available here to provide materials which may be presumed to be significant for the work of the committee and possibly for other congres- 7 See Ralph E. Flanders, "Administering the Em- ployment Act-The First Year," 7 Public Administration Review 221 (Autumn, 1947).</page><page sequence="8">BOOK REVIEWS sional committees. The Joint Economic Com- mittee also is a special investigatory agency. Its hearings have not been limited to the materials provided in or related to the Eco- nomic Report; the committee occasionally has ranged far and wide to look into subjects of current significance. The stuff of this congres- sional investigating agency is, however, not Communism, crime, and corruption, but such typically unexciting subjects as steel prices, middle-income housing, poverty in the United States, and the relationship of prices to eco- nomic growth.8 The Joint Economic Committee has no power to report legislation. Its investigatory power does, however, extend to the exposure of malpractice, albeit economic malpractice. Its influence on specific legislation must come from the prestige of its hearings and reports and the persuasiveness of its members. There have been a few memorable occasions on which the committee's influence was substan- tial and immediate. One of these was in 1950 after the outbreak of hostilities in Korea. At that time, the House of Representatives had enacted a bill to provide for tax reduction, and the measure awaited action in the Senate. Hearings sponsored by the Joint Economic Committee dramatized the need for tax in- creases in the face of mounting inflationary pressures, and these hearings undoubtedly were a factor contributing to a rapid rewrite of the bill in the Senate Finance Committee. On other occasions, the work of the Joint Eco- nomic Committee has been considerably less spectacular. There were some who hoped, at the time of the Employment Act, that the Council of Eco- nomic Advisers and the Joint Economic Com- mittee, working together, would furnish new machinery for congressional-Administration economic policy formulation. This has not oc- curred; one of the reasons is the uncertainty of the council as to its relations with the joint committee and with other congressional com- mittees. The pattern has varied somewhat with the personalities, but, in general, a close ' Two of the best known and most significant of these investigations have been in the field of monetary policy-the Douglas subcommittee and the Patman subcommittee investigations. working relationship is not possible because of the council's position as a staff agency to the President. The council has conceived its role, as it must in accordance with the statute, primarily as a consultant and adviser to the President. In this semi-confidential capacity, the members of the council have been, on most occasions, reluctant to talk openly and frankly about the assumptions underlying the President's Economic Report.9 It may well be, however, that the things the Joint Economic Committee has done have been of importance equal to those things it has not done. The committee can take some credit for a rapid increase in congressional ex- pertise in the field of economics since World War II. Congressional debate rather fre- quently is marked by references to the data of national income accounting, where the non- economist once would have feared to tread. How is it possible to determine the influ- ence of these papers and panelists on policy determination in the field of federal expendi- tures? Those who read the papers and the hearings undoubtedly will be wiser than they were before. But who, aside from academics, will read them? The outside observer has par- ticular difficulty in appraising the impact of the hearings, and indeed, it may well be that the congressmen themselves are uncertain of what is accomplished. The sometime reader of congressional hearings, like the reader of the Congressional Record, is alternately amused and annoyed, bored and fascinated, informed and mystified. This set of hearings is frequently distinguished by incisive ques- tions, well formulated, with a response that is superficial and evasive. Similarly, what sounds to the reader like a standard silly question oc- casionally elicits an unusually penetrating reply. The following questions indicate the na- ture of some of the gambits: Representative Mills: My first question is whether history suggests some necessary relationship be- tween economic progress and either the size or kind of government expenditures. (p. 12) 9 See, for example, Hearings Before the Joint Eco- nomic Committee, January, 1958, Economic Report of the President, 85th Congress, 2nd Session, 1958, pp. 4-32.</page><page sequence="9">348 PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REVIEW Representative Mills: The Fiscal Policy Subcom- mittee asked you to prepare papers on what must certainly be one of the thorniest questions in pub- lic finance, "What objective standards are there for determining what Government should do?" (p. 38) Representative Mills: Let us also assume that the proposed $1o billion increase in defense expendi- tures is generally agreed to be a minimum amount, on the basis of the most expert military views of our defense needs. Under these circumstances, how should the ex- penditure policymaker approach the problem? Should he attempt to finance the expenditure by equivalent reductions in other Government spend- ing, in private spending, or both? (p. 51) Representative Curtis: If it is desirable for local governments to handle these things if we had our preferences, isn't the intermediate step a question of what might be done, if anything, to encourage the local governments to undertake to meet these needs and following that further, isn't that actually what the grants, many of the grants-in-aid, orig- inally are attempting to do-stimulate the local and State governments to move into these areas? (pp. 85-86) Representative Mills: Professor Harberger has sug- gested a rule for evaluating the economy of public works programs. Can any of you suggest how we can evolve some objective, generally applicable standards to apply to this problem? Which of you would like to lead off? .. . .What is the problem? (p. 123) Representative Curtis: My concluding observation is, of course, the complete immobilization of labor is feudalism. I think that that is not a very good economic state. If I may turn it over to the panel for discussion: No. i, is it the function of Federal Government to effect redistribution of wealth and, No. 2, if it does do that, does not the Federal Gov- ernment have to be extremely careful lest they interfere with normal economic growth and devel- opment, and using immobilization of labor as one aspect where there might be an impeding effect. Does anyone care to volunteer or comment? (p. 469) As a panelist said at one point, "By the terms of your question you took us out of the ivory tower and put us into the operational atmosphere of Congress." (Heller, Hearings, p. 58) If the value of the Joint Committee's con- tribution under review here is to be appraised by the attendance of the subcommittee mem- bers, it must be concluded that the effort was close to failure. The subcommittee chairman, Congressman Mills, attended, presided, and made many effective contributions. Of the re- maining four members, only one, Representa- tive Curtis, attended with any regularity. There was occasional attendance by other members of the subcommittee and, less regu- larly, by members of the full committee. However, the kinds of questions asked by committee members, the kinds of responses elicited, and the attendance of committee members are the indicia but not the measure- ment of effectiveness. In a general and undefinable way, the pres- tige and influence of the Joint Economic Com- mittee depend on the prestige and influence of its counterpart in the administration-the Council of Economic Advisers. It seems likely that when economic knowledge is respected within the administration, it is likewise re- spected within the Congress. The attainment of the "objectives of the Employment Act," a phrase become trite by overuse, depends more on the council than on the Joint Economic Committee.10 Unfortunately, the council recently has gone into a partial eclipse. During the years 1953-57, under the leadership of Arthur F. Burns, CEA was a strong and virile executive agency. The council and the administration were rather aggressive in meeting the 1954 recession and met it with considerable success, both in terms of combating the recession and in terms of the prestige of the council. But the 1957-58 recession has been handled differently by the administration. The council has not taken the lead in a stabilization program; ex- ecutive quiescence has prevailed. Interestingly enough, the vacuum in the formulation of an anti-recession program has not been filled by the Joint Economic Com- mittee.
