<plain_text><page sequence="1">Theory NARRATION IN THE FICTION FILM By David Bordwell. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1985. One might have expected that after co-author- ing (with Janet Staiger and Kristin Thompson) a text as weighty-in every sense-as The Classical Hollywood Cinema,' David Bordwell would have rested for a decade. Instead, he appears to have immediately recast, repeated, refined and expanded upon the ideas concern- ing filmic narration in his last book and in earlier works such as Film Art.: An Introduc- tion2 and The Films of Carl-Theodor Dreyer3 to produce a rigorous and erudite study. Nar- ration in the Fiction Film concentrates on a particular swatch of the many possible ap- proaches to film as a narrative, that is, the analysis of "narrative as a process, the activity of selecting, arranging, and rendering story material in order to achieve specific time- bound effects on a perceiver" (p. xi). After a rather selective survey of previous critical studies relevant to his subject, Bord- well sets forth his own theory, which draws heavily on the writings of the Russian formal- ists and of contemporary narrative theorists such as Tvestan Todorov, G6rard Genette, Meir Sternburg, and Seymour Chatman, and on the tenets of Constructivist theories of perception and cognition. Bordwell argues that viewers approach films equipped with various schemata from past experiences with films and other forms of narrative. While watching the movie, the viewer makes assump- tions, draws inferences, tests hypotheses, sees these verified or refuted, and embraces alter- nate hypotheses. At the same time the film proceeds by a complicated dance of providing and withholding information, of making and filling "gaps," and advancing and retarding the unfolding of the story. Bordwell goes on to discuss how strategies of narration are influenced by genre conventions (he uses the detective film and the melodrama as his exam- ples), and manifested through various meth- ods of handling time (questions of temporal order, duration and frequency A la Genette), and space (questions of perspective, mise-en- scene and continuity). In the final section he posits a theory of "historical modes of narration," arguing that throughout film history distinct modes of narration have developed, each with its own norms for guiding the viewer's comprehension of the story. He allows that there may be other modes, but he identifies four: "classical nar- ration," represented by Hollywood films and typically identifiable by tight causality, psychologically motivated, goal-oriented characters, and careful spatial continuity; "art-cinema narration," exemplified by the films of European directors such as Bergman, Resnais, Fellini, etc., and marked by a more "realistic," open-ended approach to causal- ity, episodic plots, characters in psychological crisis, and authorial commentary; "historical- materialist narration," found in the work of Soviet film-makers in the twenties and thir- ties, typified by rhetorical appeals to the audience, characters as types rather than indi- viduals, and an abstract use of space; and finally, "parametric narration," which he locates in the films of directors such as Ozu, Mizoguchi, Dreyer, and Bresson, and which he defines as marked by excessive patterning of cinematic techniques which are irrelevant to the construction of the story. Bordwell concludes with a discussion of the baffling narration found in the films Godard made from 1959-1967. Narration in the Fiction Film moves rather squarely, even formidably, into a hole in film scholarship and will undoubtedly ground the discussion for years to come. Bordwell's argu- ment about how the viewer interacts with the film is a salutory refutation of the myth of viewer passivity. His account of how viewers make sense of a narrative is intuitively reason- able (though one wishes that he had contrasted his approach with the current theories of reader-response critics such as Wolfgang Iser). His demonstration of how films arouse inter- est and involvement through the creation, suppression or flouting of gaps and through a range of knowledge, self-consciousness, and communicativeness provides a concise and 43</page><page sequence="2">rather masterful application of literary con- cepts concerning "point of view" or "focal- ization." His definitions of the first three his- torical modes are intriguing and fecund. (The last fails to convince, particularly because, as he himself admits, the film-makers he wishes to include are not linked by time period or nationality; thus Bordwell puts himself in the odd position of arguing for an "ahistorical" historical mode.) Praiseworthy as it may be, one also finds ample reason to take issue with this study. The book jacket claims that it will be welcomed by "every serious film scholar, student or fan"; I cannot imagine anyone but the most serious scholar finishing it. Although it treats but one corner of the possible issues relating film and narrative, its text covers 336 double-column pages. (Thus, it is roughly as long as Rimmon- Kenan's Narrative Fiction, Chatman's Story and Discourse and Genette's Narrative Dis- course put together.) Bordwell habitually builds his arguments from the ground up; the reader must work through lengthy discussions of perspective in painting, theories of the psy- chology of perception, arguments for and against serial music, and definitions of ab- stract terms such as "mode" or "norm." In addition, Bordwell includes a proliferation of close analyses of examples. Segments from more than twenty films, Rear Window, Po- temkin, Sunrise, Murder My Sweet, The Big Sleep, In This Our Life, The Spider's Strate- gem, The Confrontation, La Guerre estfinie, The New Babylon, Pickpocket, Wild and Woolly, Miss Lulu Bett, Lady Windemere's Fan, Say it with Songs, His Girl Friday, The Killers, Heaven Knows Mr. Allison, and Pierrot le fou, come in for exhaustive and exhausting analysis. Furthermore, I find myself in fundamental disagreement with aspects of Bordwell's ap- proach to his subject. Bordwell is not willing to subscribe to the "communication theory" of narrative, the theory that sees all narratives as proceding from a sender of some sort (tel- ler, narrator, author) to a receiver of some sort (reader, listener, viewer, narratee, etc.). Thus, he rejects the concept, initially proposed by Albert Laffey and subsequently embraced by Christian Metz, Bruce Kawin, Andr6 Gau- dreault and others, that all films can be seen as narrated by an offscreen, rather nebulous master of ceremonies figure, which Laffey called le grand imagier (grand image-maker). Bordwell argues that "narration is better understood as the organization of a set of cues for the construction of a story. This presup- poses a perceiver, but not any sender of a message. This scheme allows for the possibil- ity that the narrational process may some- times mimic the communication situation more or less fully [italics his] .... There is no point in positing communication as the fundamental process of all narration, only to grant that most films 'efface' or 'conceal' this process." He grants that some films rather forcefully elicit a sense of a narrator but he claims that this sense stems from certain "specific organizational principles, historical factors, and viewer's mental sets. Contrary to what the communication model implies, this sort of narrator does not create the narra- tion; the narration, appealing to historical norms of viewing, creates the narrator." (p. 62) If narrative is not a form of communica- tion, what is it? How can a message be delib- erately organized for a perceiver but not have a sender? How can stories, in any moment of history, tell themselves? Bordwell condemns the positing of a grand image-maker as an "anthropomorphic fiction" and goes on to transfer what I would label as human activities and qualities to an abstract process; according to him, narration, rather than a narrator, "suppresses" information, "restricts" our knowledge, "generates" curiosity, "creates" a tone, is more or less "knowledgeable," more or less "communicative," more or less "self-conscious." Bordwell only grants that the viewer might sense the presence of a nar- rating entity while watching Godard's films or films belonging to his "art cinema" or "parametric" modes. But do Godard's films really have more of a personifiable presence behind them than Hitchcock's? Like Roland Barthes in his "The Death of the Author"4 essay, Bordwell wishes to divorce narrative texts not only from concrete, flesh-and-blood creators, but even from loose models of human behavior. I find this approach rather misanthropic. Moreover, I am not (heresy of heresies) totally convinced by Bordwell's efforts to historicize modes of narration. What this book and Classical Hollywood Cinema seek 44</page><page sequence="3">to prove is that the mode of storytelling in Hollywood films is not "natural" or "inevi- table" but the product of a specific mode of production and cultural discourse. Certainly the argument holds for questions of style. But Bordwell gives rather short shrift to what he calls "canonic narration" and to the fact, underlying the whole concept of narrative theory to begin with, that narratives of differ- ent cultures, time periods and even media display marked similarities. In The Classical Hollywood Cinema Kristin Thompson details the influence on Hollywood of the well-made play and nineteenth-century novels and short stories. But what Bordwell doesn't discuss in either book is that "classical" films seem "ex- cessively obvious" not only because they adhere to those proximate influences but also because they correspond (in a way that some other types of films do not) to an ancient tradition of popular storytelling. What, to me, is most intriguing about cinematic narra- tives is the extent to which, as Peter Wollen has demonstrated, a structural description of Russian fairy tales is applicable to North by Northwest.5 -SARAH KOZLOFF NOTES 1.
