Each side wall contains three paintings, with pseudo-Gothic painted lunettes and nitches above. One of the narrative paintings (The Appearance of the Cross to St. Francis) introduces a cavernous background which is copied from an old photo- graph of a road tunnel near Lucerne, another (Cain and Abel) is a copy of an academic work by a Munich artist, Gebhardt, but with "much greater tension, anguish, and violence than . . . the original." The sources of the other four paintings have not been identified, though Frankenstein characterizes some of the figures in the Hell as "a tormented crew worthy of Masaccio." Probably earlier than Honaunau was the ruined church near Kealia, largely destroyed in an earthquake in 1950. In this small building the paintings were executed directly on the plaster walls, and the fragmentary remains of a young girl kneeling before a cross, with Mary and Jesus on the opposite side, are extraordi- narily evocative of the great traditions of west- ern European religious art. Father Evarist was a student of Father John, and created his own masterpiece in the church at Kalapana in 1930. Here there are six ceiling paintings, four ceiling angels, the Sistine Ma- donna of Raphael on the altar wall, an enor- mous Nativity (22 by 14 feet), and various decorative details. Most interesting are the di- rect comparisons which can be made between the banal and flabby originals and the strangely moving and intense paintings adapted from them. Here one may see, as Frankenstein writes, "how signally the folk artist has improved on his model. In fitting these angels into a pre-es- tablished, geometrically outlined space, Father Evarist was forced to elongate their figures and place them horizontally rather than vertically; he simplified and enhanced the rhythm of their drapery, flattened the modeling of the figures, and in all but the blue angel reversed the curves of the wings, thereby enormously in- creasing the strength of each silhouette. He also gave these angels small heads with pointed chins and long, Modigliani-like noses; this is the final touch of departure from the anthro- pomorphic realism of his model." No doubt the weathered condition of the paintings in all three churches has toned down the original rather garish colors, which also adds to our present enjoyment of them. I think we know much more about the spe- cific attitude of the folk artist after reading this book and studying these reproductions than we did before. This is an exercise which should be brought to the attention of all those who are concerned with the problem of the life of style, of the continuity of tradition. It helps us to understand certain far removed stylistic de- velopments in early mediaeval times as well as to define and evaluate the non-historical, un- selfconscious artist who may be living today. It is a pleasure to handle a book so well- made and so well-designed. The photographs by Norman Carlson are first-rate, the color plates excellent. It is altogether a rare and heart-warming study, beautifully and modestly accomplished. ALLEN S. WELLER The University of Illinois Tibor Bodrogi Art in North-East New Guinea, tr. tva R6cz, 228 pp., 240 ill. (8 in color). Budapest: Publishing House of the Hungarian Acad- emy of Sciences, 1961. $9.50. The Huon Gulf area of north-east New Guinea has long been regarded as the home- ground of one of the island's most distinctive art-styles. Its individuality was first proposed by Finsch in 1888, and again by Preuss in 1897 -early dates in the study of New Guinea ethnology. It was isolated by Gladys Reichard in 1933 as the "Tami style," so named for the bowls made on that small group of off-shore islands. In 1936 Speiser, in his semi-historical study of New Guinea art, suggested the Tami style as lately-formed but critically representa- tive, with widely disseminated influence in Mel- anesia. In spite of the broad promise of its title, Tibor Bodrogi's book is actually confined to a study of this notable style, and is the first ex- tensive work devoted to it. The book has some quite crucial limitations. Like so many other studies of the kind, it has been written without benefit of field-work; inevitably, since by now any attempt at such investigation of the art would be pointless, owing to its extinction as a living form during the course of the changes the native culture has undergone in the last half-century. Bodrogi has had, however, the benefit of one invaluable source: the Ethno- graphical Museum of Budapest (of which he is Director) possesses the rich collection of about 1,000 objects Lajos Biro made in 1898- 1899, only five years after continuous contact with Europeans began. While Biro himself published his material on Astrolabe Bay and the Aitape regions, his Huon Gulf notes re- mained in manuscript. Bodrogi has been able, therefore, to draw on Bir6's collection and writings, with side-lights from some other con- tinental museums. No Australian museum's col- lection is considered, nor is the quantity of im- portant objects and information collected by A. B. Lewis from Bamler and Voogdt about 1909 for the Chicago Natural History Museum. The book is arranged on an attractively sim- ple and useful plan. The meat of it is in three sections. The first describes "The Background" -geography, material culture, social organiza- tion and religious life; the next, "Art," is a series of detailed accounts of categories of ob- jects, arranged according to materials; followed by a study of "Motifs"-anthropomorphic, zoo- morphic and geometric. One can only read the second section, in particular, with enthusiasm and admiration for the painstaking thorough- ness with which Bodrogi has assembled an im- pressive mass of material. The types of objects which he has failed to classify, describe and il- lustrate must be few indeed, if they exist at all. Each account deals as fully as possible with technical methods of manufacture, use and sig- nificance. There will hardly be any excuse in the future for the cataloguist who misassigns an object from the area. The section on "Mo- tifs" is also of a rare comprehensiveness: a somewhat Haddonesque lexicon of the pattern- elements on which the prominent two-dimen- sional quotient of all Huon Gulf objects is based. They are interpreted and assigned to their normal contexts in the art with consider- able detail. The last section-"Conclusions"-deals with the social functions of the art objects; the dis- tribution of the style; and its ultimate aesthetic value. In general, this part of the book is the most open to criticism. The discussion of dis- tribution is based on the presumption that Huon Gulf art shows a unified style. Bodrogi concludes this from the idea of the Gulf peo- ple's desire for an admired standard, and the widespread trading of some objects from the Tami Islands. One cannot but think that here he is too concerned with the subjective attitude of the people themselves. It would have been valuable if, after establishing the geographical boundaries of his main area, Bodrogi had gone on to demarcate the sub-areas which the actual objects quite visibly suggest. To state that this is the least satisfactory sec- tion is to say no more than Bodrogi admits, since its shortcomings follow inevitably from the standard he sets himself. He takes as fun- damentally valid Raymond Firth's proposition that "all art is composed in a social setting; it has a cultural content." This idea, so far from new to students of the European arts, seems only now about to receive general acceptance among anthropologists and ethnologists. Even so, its possibilities have not yet been fully ex- plored by students of primitive art, though some field-work is at last being conducted on these lines. One may indeed hope that such in- vestigations will play a major r6le in studies of African and Oceanic art for some time to come; combined with detailed investigations of what may loosely be called "symbolism," it is likely that they will give us the insights needed for a real understanding of the subject. Bodrogi is hampered by the fact that his sources are, as he says, "rather laconic whenever they refer to the social-cultural relations of art as a whole"; to the extent that they hardly permit him to em- bark on any positive formulations of the kind he suggests as desirable. In a typically para- doxical situation, he returns for the last word on style to the work of art-historians, and Lin- ton's and Wingert's description of Huon Gulf art (in their Arts of the South Seas) as char- acterised by "lethargic heaviness and inert- ness." His familiarity with the social structure, however, leads him to correct their rather too bald equation of this "static" art with a "sta- tic" society. His observations on this point- taking into account considerations of technique as well as social conditions-are so acute that one wishes he had developed this line of thought further, or that he will do so in some future publication on a more fruitful area. What he does not discuss-though admittedly it is hardly within his charter to do so-is the question of reconciling social and technical facts with differing aesthetic evaluations. This kind of debatable point is familiar enough to art historians-not to mention day-to-day crit- ics-in other fields; students of primitive art must be prepared to face it sooner or later, when a greater flexibility of aesthetic judge- ment becomes possible to them. When all due reservations have been made, within the limits of the material available to him, and those he has imposed on himself with some rigour, Bodrogi has produced a book which is not likely to be soon replaced. With ART JOURNAL XXII 2 130</page><page sequence="2">its copious information and wealth of photo- graphs, it is a model sourcebook. During the last few years, detailed studies have been de- voted to a number of New Guinea's style-areas, and more have been announced. In print or in prospect, this amounts to respectable progress towards a first survey of this enormous subject. Bodrogi's book is a generous contribution, val- uable not only on account of the status ac- corded by other scholars to his topic, but of special interest and importance on its own mer- its. DOUGLAS NEWTON The Museum of Primitive Art, New York Denes Pataky Hungarian Drawings and Water-Colours, 66 pages, 191 illustrations (30 in color). Budapest: Corvina, 1961. The art of smaller nations is sometimes un- duly neglected and discovery in geographic areas upon which the sharp limelight of pub- licity has not fallen so far is pleasing. Unfor- tunately, Hungary does not seem to be a place where remarkable new talents might be found, or where hitherto ignored genius among the dead might be brought to light. This is, at least, the impression gained from studying the present large anthology. The introduction serves as a general guide through Hungarian art in the past seven or eight centuries. In fact, for historical reasons-Hungary for centuries was enslaved by the Turks, and thereafter not too happy under its new masters, the dictatorial Austrians-there hardly existed any truly Hun- garian art prior to 1800. The 17th century Johann Spillenberger was born in Kassa, a town in Northern Hungary, but his name is German, his work recalls German baroque art, and the well-known Austrian art historian, Karl Ginhart, might be forgiven for calling German an artist who spent nearly all his life in German-speaking lands. On the other hand, Jakob Bogdany (1660-1724) was known in England as "The Hungarian," although he left Hungary as a young man, painted in the style of the lesser Dutch artists under whom he had studied, and became the court painter of Wil- liam III and a British subject. The pen and ink sketches, pastels and wa- tercolors of the 19th century Hungarian mas- ters immediately bring to mind the work of Rahl and Waldmueller in Vienna, or of Kaul- bach and Piloty in Munich. In these works- often charming and delicate, and always com- petently executed portraits, landscapes and genre scenes-they never managed to rise above their academic teachers. Pataky is en- thusiastic about Mihaly Munkacsy, the only Hungarian of the past who became famous out- side his country's art circles, but one is most reluctant to accept the comparisons to Rem- brandt, or even to Courbet-neither "Milton Dictating to His Daughters" (in the New York Public Library, nor the sketches included in the present volume can persuade us that he truly belongs "to the rank of the great painters of the [19th] century." In our century, several Hungarian artists have, indeed, made names for themselves in the international art world, but Pataky, who con- tinuously echoes the philosophy of Socialist Realism, barely mentions them, doing so only in scorn, and offers not a single sample of their work. They include the late Laszlo Moholy- Nagy, his pupil Victor Vasarhely, and Alfred Reth, all of whom left Hungary and, what is even more reprehensible to Pataky, engaged in bold aesthetic experiments and ventures. Still adhering to formulas that prevailed in the Sta- linist era, he has praise only for those who "never lost ground of reality and of beauty" (without bothering to define either term). He is even hard on such tame post-Impressionists as the group who called themselves "The Eight" (and included Bela Czobel, a pupil of Matisse) because "their point of departure was not the visual image but ideas." He censures them because "the beauty of the visual image was lost in their works and often gave way to brutal distortions." Illogically, he is pleased whenever an artist is willing to serve the idea of Socialism. Thus he hails a certain Gyula Derkovits as "the greatest figure of Hungarian socialist painting" and adds: "He was a prole- tarian, and he espoused the cause of the prole- tariat to the end. His whole art was a militant stand for the proletarian cause." To a Western observer, Derkovits appears as a solid draftsman without a grain of origi- nality. Still he is superior to Sandor lk who, from 1933 to 1944, worked in the Soviet Un- ion, and whose "Soviet Truce-Flag Bearer killed by the German Nazis" and "Soviet Gun Position in Heroes' Square, Budapest" are cheap melodramatic illustrations. Pataky praised his compatriots for having resisted such "ex- treme" trends as Cubism, Futurism, Expres- sionism, Surrealism, and the various non-figu- rative developments, for not concerning them- selves with metaphysics nor with the crisis of the modern world. This is like saying: "I con- gratulate you for ignoring all events that have taken place in the realm of aesthetics during the past fifty years, and for producing, in sheep- like docility, all that Big Brother insists is good for the People." The celebrated thaw which, in some of the countries behind the Iron Curtain, has recently succeeded in defrosting the imagi- nation and daring of creative individuals, does not seem to have reached Hungary yet! ALFRED WERNER Arts Magazine, New York Harald Keller Die Kunstlandschaften Italiens, 388 pp., 788 ill. Munchen: Prestel Verlag, 1960. DM 90. The investigation of the artistic geography of Italy requires not only a comprehensive knowledge of its art but also a detailed famili- arity with its landscapes. Both the author pos- sesses. Many areas he has, in the manner of the "Cicerone" Jakob Burckhardt, transversed on foot. A feeling for the sensory experience and for the particular instance permeates a text which easily could have succumbed to generali- zations. To notice the spirit of locality was already familiar to authors of the 17th century. G. B. Passeri writes in his biography of the sculptor Francesco Mocchi: "I would say that Tuscany holds on obstinately to its dry manner of paint- ing and that Lombardy neglects precision of draftsmanship" (p. 27). Writers of the last fifty years such as Leonardo Olschki and especially Julius von Schlosser have developed a sharp- ened understanding of the art historical physi- ognomy of localities and in the most recent work on Italian art, Andre Chastel's L'art Italian, the introductory chapter is entitled "The country and its art-landscapes." Yet nobody-as far as I can see-has suc- ceeded in describing so methodically and at the same time so intimately the peculiar character of architecture, sculpture and painting as it ex- isted in the individual areas of Italy. The spirit of a geographical area is here not considered as a product of a racial inheritance but of hu- man lives lived in a defined geographical set- ting which produces a specific flavor in artistic creation. There exist also definite limitations to such a method pointed out here and there by the author: genius, most of all, transcends deter- mining factors of milieu, courts tend to patron- age on a supranational basis, classicist move- ments transgress delimiting factors of milieu. And finally the interaction of the time-style with the place-style is a problem of considera- ble complexity. For these reasons the approach of the author finds its ideal support in the Quattrocento, in which the spirit of local tra- dition came to its fullest fruition, while the following century already shows those univer- salizing tendencies which develop in an age of centralized monarchies. The chapters, accompanied by large and de- tailed maps, deal with Tuscany, Florence, Siena, Umbria, Rome, Southern Italy, Northern Italy, Lombardy, Emilia (including the Romagna), Venice and the Terra Ferma. Geographical anal- ysis leading to a cultural ecology precedes in every chapter the description of the artistic character. While these characteristics of the lo- cal schools of painting are more or less famil- iar to the student of art history, the brilliant analysis of architecture in regard to its local modification will bring a fresh awareness to the reader. There are very few statements to which this reviewer would take exception. That the 16th century in Florence discarded the statue-bust is contradicted by Cellini's bust of the Archduke Cosimo. Yet it is correct that it has lost the im- portance it had in the age of Verrocchio. That El Greco was a great painter as long as he stayed in Venice but in later years lost this col- oristic brilliance is a value statement question- able to anyone who has seen the "Burial of Count Orgaz." Nor are we convinced that Canova's classicist sculpture is necessarily de- termined by the "Classicizing" milieu of Ven- ice. His earliest works rather bespeak a bravura style in the naturalistic treatment of the marble which is peculiar to Venice, while the trans- formation into Classicism may have come about -as in the case of Mengs-through the impact of supranational theories and tendencies. Yet such controversial statements must by necessity exist in a book so rich in ideas and observa- tions. This then is a brilliant and essential contri- bution and a translation into English would seem desirable. No student of Italian art can bypass this book in the future. That it is writ- ten with grace and warmth only helps its su- perior scholarship. The publisher has given it an immaculate ap- pearance.
