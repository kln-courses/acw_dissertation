         <p>ON 13 JANUARY 1982, it had been snowing at National Airport in Washington, D.C., for most of the day. The snow stopped around 3 p.m., and Air Florida Flight 90 was cleared for takeoff forty-five minutes later. With ice on its wings, the airplane never reached the speed it needed to gain altitude. Less than a minute after takeoff, it collided with the Fourteenth Street Bridge and plunged into the icy Potomac River below. Seventy-eight people died. Navy divers recovered the cockpit voice recorders a week later. News stations covering the accident played clips of the cockpit conversation between the pilot and the copilot. By 1 February, National Transportation Safety Board investigators concluded that the pilots attempted takeoff too long after the plane’s last deicing. Patches of snow on the short runway (and possibly ice in the engine), coupled with an instrument malfunction, contributed to the plane’s slow initial speed and later stall once airborne.<sup>1</sup> In short, they suggested that a complex network of compounded small failures caused the accident.<sup>2</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Evolutionary biologist Robert Trivers was paying close attention to news coverage of the accident because a friend of his, entomologist Bob Silberglied, had been killed in the crash. Several years earlier, Trivers had become friends and intellectual collaborators with Huey P. Newton—cofounder of the Black Panthers and a former graduate student in the History of Consciousness Program at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where Trivers taught classes in evolutionary theory. Together they were working on a project concerning the evolution of “deceit and self-deception”; they had signed a book contract under that title three years earlier with the publisher Rawson, Wade.<sup>3</sup> When Trivers heard the broadcast of the pilots’ voices, he understandably discussed their final words with Newton. Although the copilot recognized that the plane was in trouble, the pilot verbally denied its difficulty until seconds before the crash. This, Trivers and Newton decided, might represent an archetypal example of self-deception in action. They wrote to the National Transportation Safety Board to obtain a full transcript of the cockpit conversation. By November, they published a brief encapsulation of their reasoning in <italic>Science News</italic>. Rather than seeing the plane crash as having been caused by multiple errors in a complex system, as had the NTSB investigators, Newton and Trivers concluded that the pilot’s self-deception was “the main factor leading up to the disaster.” This reconfiguration, they continued, had “implications for air safety and, by analogy, implications for our understanding of the way in which natural selection acts on processes of self-deception.”<sup>4</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Yet a great deal of work would be needed to make that claim scientifically plausible. In order for biologists to believe that self-deception was a behavior subject to natural selection, they would first have to accept it as a distinct, at least partially heritable, trait. In the case of most morphological characters (ears or legs, for example), biologists do little work to call these epistemic things into existence.<sup>5</sup> Behaviors, on the other hand, can be complicated or even, in the case of self-deception, counterintuitive.<sup>6</sup> Rather than seeing misperceptions as the result of individuals’ faulty interpretations of reality, Newton and Trivers attempted to establish “self-deception” as a biologically coherent entity.<sup>7</sup> They failed.</p>
         <p>This essay explores the intellectual (and personal) stakes behind Newton and Trivers’s vision of humans as fundamentally duplicitous. As the social sciences began to professionalize in the late nineteenth century, they granted the distinction between “nature” and “culture” professional jurisdiction as well as philosophical importance (see Lorraine Daston’s essay in this Focus section). The end result, well established in the first decades of the twentieth century, gave primary responsibility for “is” to the natural scientists, while social scientists addressed “ought” (see also Matthew Stanley’s essay in this Focus section). Connections between “is” and “ought” fashioned by natural scientists thus came to resemble attempts to wrest authority over human nature from the hands of social scientists. Nowhere were these battles more visible to the public or more heated than in the enduring controversy over sociobiological reasoning—the background against which this story stands in stark relief.<sup>8</sup> Because appeals to nature are so widespread within twentieth-century biological analyses of human behavior—especially claims that reinforce social difference, such as the biological predisposition of males to be aggressive and females to be coy or arguments about race and IQ—it can be easy to assume that most appeals are likely to be appropriated by ready and willing audiences. This field study of con games thus serves as a helpful means of interrogating the reasons why such naturalistic reasoning occasionally, or perhaps even typically, founders.</p>

         <title>AN EVOLVING FRIENDSHIP</title>
         <p>If Newton became curious about evolution as a result of his interest in con games, Trivers came to appreciate self-deception through evolutionary theory. Each man supplied a different kind of expertise: Newton shared his personal experiences with deception on the streets as (from Trivers’s perspective) a field-tested observer of human behavior, while Trivers contributed his mathematical acumen and knowledge of the biological sciences. Together they sought to place our evolutionary understanding of human social behavior on a new theoretical footing.</p>
         <p>Newton had been fascinated by con games since at least his early involvement with the Black Panther Party. In 1967, he argued that African Americans were “penned up in the ghettos of America, surrounded by the white man’s factories and all the physical components of his economic system; we have been made into ‘the wretched of the earth,’ relegated to the position of spectators while the White racists run their international con game on the suffering peoples.”<sup>9</sup> He used the idea of con games not only to characterize the social lies white America invoked to justify the continued oppression of blacks, but also to describe the small ways in which he and other men made their way in this deceitful environment by (in turn) conning whites.<sup>10</sup> Several years later, Newton began seeing the evolutionary origins of humanity as partially responsible for the deep social inequalities that also divided the sexes—which, he suggested, had been elicited as a result of a violent reaction among males against the “natural superiority” of women. He concluded, “The paradigm for it all began in the Garden of Eden, or rather, the Olduvai Gorge in Africa.”<sup>11</sup> Perhaps biology could indeed provide some answers.</p>
         <p>As a young man, Trivers had been absorbed in astronomy and then mathematics, but he abandoned both “because they said next to nothing, or nothing directly, about the human condition, or how to interpret the behavior of yourself and others.”<sup>12</sup> In his undergraduate years at Harvard he turned to history, followed by psychology, before discovering evolutionary theory in his mid-twenties.<sup>13</sup> Evolution offered him a new set of tools with which to make sense of the behavioral tropes that seemed to characterize human social relations: why we help each other, sometimes at the expense of our own self-interest; why men and women seem to invest in their children according to different rubrics; why women and men look for different qualities in life partners; and how parents and their offspring come into conflict over the distribution of resources within families.<sup>14</sup> From this perspective, Trivers became entranced by questions of deceit and self-deception. He recalled wondering how natural selection could simultaneously favor both exquisitely refined sensory organs and systematic distortions of the information they gathered once it reached the brain. How much more logical, he reasoned, to suppose that natural selection favored the distortion from the beginning.<sup>15</sup> Yet where to find the data on which to base his theory?</p>
         <p>Like other members of the Black Panther Party, Newton valued education as a key political tool and means of economic self-improvement.<sup>16</sup> He earned his bachelor’s degree at the University of California, Santa Cruz, in 1974. In the fall of 1978, when Newton heard that Trivers was moving to Santa Cruz from Harvard University, he asked the marine mammologist Burney LaBoeuf to introduce them. At the time Newton was in prison, charged with beating Oakland tailor Preston Callins. Once released on bail, Newton traveled to LaBoeuf’s house, where he met Trivers for the first time. Newton was thirty-six, Trivers thirty-five. They had a lot to discuss. After a second meeting, at Newton’s home in Oakland, they quickly became friends. Trivers later recalled being struck by Newton’s “natural-born genius.” He described “Huey” as “unique in the explosive and persuasive power of his personality.”<sup>17</sup> Within months, Trivers became one of the few white men to join what remained of the Black Panther Party and Newton became godfather to his newborn daughter.<sup>18</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Trivers and Newton believed that deceit and self-deception had to be approached naturalistically because of the deep evolutionary history that underlay the expression of these behaviors—even animals sought to deceive members of other species through mimicry and behavioral posturing, for example.<sup>19</sup> They then posited that the capacity for deceit and, ultimately, self-deception emerged from the social nature of humanity itself. One of the best ways for individuals to succeed in competitive interactions would be for them to deceive themselves, the better to deceive others.<sup>20</sup> In Trivers’s analysis, self-deception became an ur-theory within which his other evolutionary ideas could be conceptualized. He saw all exploitative or oppressive relationships in society as inherently self-deceptive, even parents’ commitments to their children. Newton, too, contended that the larger social dynamics of white and black cultures operated according to similar principles. Newton’s had been a “very stormy life.” He claimed that he’d “suffered a lot of persecution and prosecution from the state”; to survive he “had to understand deception.”<sup>21</sup> Despite the short-term gains in money or social status that might be earned by such exploits, both Trivers and Newton asserted that in the long term self-deception was always destructive. Yet given their ubiquity, deceit and self-deception were traits that Trivers and Newton saw as deeply relevant within society and even to their own evolving friendship.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sc3">
         <title>THE TEACHER CON</title>
         <p>When they met in early February 1979, Newton invoked an old adage, telling Trivers that a wise professor allows his student to stand on his shoulders and so enables this student to see farther. Later in the same conversation, he asked, “Are you going to do what I expect for my teacher to do?” Newton urged Trivers on, calling him a “genius” and telling him to “put down the strongest, most rigid kind of framework in formal basis in our evolution as a species.” In these early moments of their relationship, we can already see the hopes each invested in the other. Trivers later described his friend as a “master logician” whose particular strength was “aggressive logic.” He continued, Newton’s “special ability was to … quickly beat you out of the position you may have taken. The argument often had a double-or-nothing quality about it where, in effect, he was doubling the stakes for each logical alternative, giving you the unpleasant sensation that you were, more than likely, losing ever more heavily as the argument continued.”<sup>22</sup> Trivers admired Newton’s strength; Newton relied on Trivers’s expertise.</p>
         <p>As they worked together, they imagined coauthoring a book on deceit and self-deception that would begin by exploring examples of deception and countermeasures in animals. Later chapters would turn to humans and discuss self-deception as an individual phenomenon, as a characteristic of family life and larger social belief systems, and as deeply imbricated in morality and everyday life. The book would conclude with a reflection on introspection as a mechanism for thinking about self-deception in their own lives. They even planned to include a chapter called “The Art of the Con” in which they described the psychological tricks of the trade that allowed con artists to dupe their victims and related “anecdotes of their exploits and those of others,” including the “short-change game” and “dummying up.”<sup>23</sup> Organizationally, then, the proposed book’s treatment of deceit and self-deception in humans developed seamlessly from a biological analysis of behavior in animals. “Humans were not created in the recent past. Like all other living creatures on this planet, we have evolved for four billion years,” the authors argued. “Our creation took place slowly, over immense periods of time, by a process we now understand in some detail: evolution by natural selection.” Only evolution could provide the “biological meaning” behind these traits. Trivers signed the original contract alone, but he immediately turned over a third of the advance to Newton, reflecting their understanding that this was a mutual (if not entirely equal) effort.<sup>24</sup>
         </p>
         <p>The actual writing took longer than planned. Newton was working on his own doctoral thesis in the History of Consciousness Program at Santa Cruz, which he defended in 1980 (Trivers was away in Jamaica)—“War against the Panthers: A Study of Repression in America.”<sup>25</sup> Trivers was adjusting to life as a tenured professor with a new set of students and professional commitments. Then, in July 1981, he produced over a hundred pages of manuscript for their book in a great flurry of productivity. Rawson, Wade, the hopeful publisher, claimed that the material Trivers had generated was “too academic in tone” and insisted that the book needed at least another chapter.<sup>26</sup> Yet again the project stalled. Throughout 1982, Trivers sought to draw up a new contract with a different publisher, but these negotiations foundered too. In the meantime, Newton and Trivers had succeeded in publishing their brief paper on the crash of Air Florida Flight 90 in <italic>Science Digest</italic>. Perhaps on the basis of that experience, Trivers agreed to split any proceeds from their book’s publication equally, as he came to believe that Newton was willing to contribute as much as he was to the project. He also suggested that, according to the tradition in mathematics governing the intellectual collaborations of co-equal authors, he would ensure that their names were listed in alphabetical order on the book: Newton first, Trivers second.<sup>27</sup>
         </p>
         <p>The journalistic introduction to the <italic>Science Digest</italic> piece identified them as “Drs. Robert Trivers and Huey P. Newton, biologists at the University of California, Santa Cruz,” and Trivers was first author after all. Their three-page essay recounted the terse conversation in the cockpit preceding the crash. They described the less-experienced copilot as “reality-seeking” and the pilot, only three years his elder but in a position of substantial power, as a “self-deceiver.” Although the copilot provided several conversational openings to initiate a discussion about deicing the plane, the pilot met his comments with either silence or diversions. In the one instance where the pilot did engage with the underlying issue, he speculated about a world in which deicing would not require losing their place in the queue of planes waiting to take off now that the storm had largely passed. Such patterns of self-deception develop over time, Trivers and Newton pointed out. They believed that the pilot’s pattern of denial was almost certainly practiced; his self-deception had become “ingrained through many small instances of positive feedback.” In animals, they analogized, a display of bravado in the face of a fight can sometimes scare away an opponent without the necessity of actual engagement. They carefully concluded that although such strategies might have short-term benefits, in real moments of crisis patterns of self-deception consistently lead to disaster because of the self-deceiver’s “impaired ability to deal with reality.”<sup>28</sup> Self-deception as a pattern of behavior, then, developed slowly over time and did not afflict all people equally. Trivers and Newton thrice drew their readers’ attention to the kinds of people they deemed especially susceptible: overconfident, adventurous men, just like the ex-military “airplane jock” pilot of Flight 90—and just like the men they perceived as artificially preserving social injustice in the United States.<sup>29</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Despite these promising moments, the book never saw the light of day. The friendship also began to fray around the edges. Trivers, especially, had hoped to include a scientific analysis of their own interactions, from each man’s perspective, so as to illustrate the fraught interpersonal dynamics that characterized deceit and self-deception between any two people. Trivers hoped to make another point, too. Recalling one of their earliest interactions, he wrote to Newton rejecting the “teacher con” that he believed Newton had worked on him. Simply by calling a man your teacher, Trivers explained, you could induce him to adopt certain behavioral patterns and act as a teacher would act. Yet he was no more Newton’s teacher than Newton was his, Trivers insisted. He would therefore no longer feel obligated to respond to Newton’s requests as if Newton were his student.<sup>30</sup> Under these conditions—and these conditions only—Trivers agreed to split the responsibility for the book as equal partners.</p>
         <p>The final letter of their correspondence held in the Stanford University Archives dates from the fall of 1983. Around that time Newton’s then-wife, Gwen Fontaine, left him and moved with their children to Chicago. Trivers began work in earnest on his textbook, <italic>Social Evolution</italic>.<sup>31</sup> Several years later, Newton died of a gunshot wound; five years after that, Trivers moved back east, to Rutgers University. In the first decades after Newton’s death, Trivers published a small number of papers on the evolution of deceit and self-deception, always based on animal models—his original forte and a long way from the material Newton would have contributed.<sup>32</sup> Even in his most recent book, <italic>The Folly of Fools</italic>, published in 2011, Trivers relates stories of his own past but steers clear of both “The Art of the Con” and the dynamics of his friendship with Newton.<sup>33</sup>

         <title>MUTED RECEPTION</title>
         <p>Few biologists paid attention to Trivers and Newton’s idea that self-deception in human behavior should be analyzed as an evolved natural response. According to the Science Citation Index, before the year 2000 only five papers referenced either “The Crash of Flight 90” or Trivers’s later “Deceit and Self-Deception”—a far cry from the citations biologists lavished on Trivers’s earlier publications during the same period, work for which he would win the prestigious Crafoord Prize in Biosciences. Rather, biologists greeted their hypothesis with resounding silence.</p>
         <p>Even before they published “The Crash of Flight 90,” Trivers and Newton had worried that people on the political Left would be wary of naturalistic reasoning about human behavior because they would associate it with conservative political arguments, especially given volatile past controversies over race and intelligence testing.<sup>34</sup> Members of the Black Panther Party, for example, had recently prevented scientists from establishing a research institute in Oakland for the study of aggressive behavior as an innate biological trait. Newton insisted that his interest in evolutionary theories of human behavior simply extended his previous commitments to understanding the underlying, often counterintuitive, reasons behind social behavior, but he knew that some of his friends would see his work with Trivers as a profound retreat from his earlier radical commitments.<sup>35</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Trivers’s colleagues were equally unsympathetic to his position. After his early years at Harvard, rumors of mental breakdowns and a lack of new publications plagued his professional standing in the field.<sup>36</sup> Although most of Trivers’s readers during these years were interested in excavating the evolutionary origins of animal action, he saw himself as striving to provide a “scientific understanding of human behavior” in which self-deception played a key role—a cognitive capacity biologists were unlikely to ascribe to most animal minds. He hoped to transform the “social ‘so-called’ sciences” through his evolutionary analyses and firmly believed that “according to our best understanding of life it is natural selection which has created us.”<sup>37</sup> Trivers later claimed that the public spotlight created by the publication of E. O. Wilson’s <italic>Sociobiology</italic> in 1975 had a temporary “bad effect” on his life. In his words, when one becomes a visible entity within any community, “the parasites that swim towards you are much more sophisticated,” a substantial problem when “you’re only used to dealing with the small timers.”<sup>38</sup> Deep in the controversy over sociobiology that continued throughout the 1980s, many evolutionary biologists preferred sticking to animal behavior rather than addressing humanity head-on. Not until the consolidation of evolutionary psychology as a field in the 1990s would Trivers find a ready scientific audience for his theories of human social behavior.<sup>39</sup> Even then, however, evolutionarily inclined psychologists latched on to reciprocal altruism, parent–offspring conflict, and Trivers’s evocative use of Darwin’s theory of sexual selection, but they largely sidestepped his theory of self-deception.<sup>40</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Appeals to nature are so ubiquitous in popular scientific discussions of human behavior that I sometimes find myself despairing that Americans will embrace any zoomorphic explanation. Even if nature is not infinitely flexible, our capacity to invest it with meaning appears to be. So what, then, are we to learn from this story of Newton and Trivers’s attempt to call a biological category into existence? Most obviously, although invoking nature to explain a human behavioral trait can be relatively simple, convincing others that the idea has merit requires a great deal more work. Failures thus tell us as much, perhaps more, about the dynamics of scientific reasoning as do successes. In this case, no one dismissed the hypothesis as a “naturalistic fallacy” and no one attacked self-deception as pseudoscientific; nor did scientists actively seek to marginalize either author.<sup>41</sup> Only in comparison to the overwhelming popularity of Trivers’s other publications can Newton and Trivers’s joint effort be seen as a failure. “The Crash of Flight 90” became one of the more than 41 percent of papers published in the biological sciences between 1981 and 1985 that remained uncited for five years.<sup>42</sup> Against these data, the muted reception of Trivers and Newton’s evolutionary theory of self-deception in fact looks fairly typical.</p>
         <p>Social scientists who sought to apply the lessons of biology to sociology, psychology, or even history might not get into hot water with their peers (or they might; see Warwick Anderson’s essay in this Focus section), but they rarely butted up against the same disciplinary difficulties that Trivers’s position invited. Reframing the sociobiological battles that characterized the late 1970s and early 1980s in terms of the naturalistic fallacy helps render visible the long trajectories supporting each side of successive nature/nurture controversies. The scientists and philosophers who sought to establish the naturalistic fallacy in the nineteenth century largely succeeded in setting the terms by which issues of individual development and scientific analyses of behavioral causation have been debated ever since. Yet we should not let the remarkable staying power of naturalistic and antinaturalistic reasoning as analytical constructs mask the difficulty of advancing any one theory in any specific historical moment.</p>
