<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Intuitionist and Pattern Recognition: A Response to Lauren Berlant John Johnston Colson Whitehead's The Intuitionist (1998) and William Gibson's Pattern Recognition (2003) are two contemporary novels in which the main characters' experiences first involve-and indeed are made possible by-specific technologies. For Lila Mae Watson in the former it is the elevator; for Cayce Pollard in the latter it is the Internet. In each novel this specific technology becomes not only the locus of a special mode of knowing but, as Lauren Berlant rightly insists, the space and trajectory of a research. Berlant, however, is concerned not with this technology but with the affective mappings that the experiences of these two female protagonists in effect adumbrate. These affective mappings, for Berlant, provide the key to how we may come to a new under standing of the historical present, in both its historicity and becoming-different or other as it nonetheless constitutes a shared historical time. Focused primarily, though not exclusively, on affective singularity, her theoretical framework and the reading it enables thus offer an alternative to "the dialectic of structure (explanation of what's systematic in the reproduction of the world) and agency (what people do in everyday life ...)" which typically inform cultural analysis of the historical novel as primary text and archive. But beyond-or even before-the economic, political, and cultural determinations of structure and agency inscribed not only in the "experience" of the individual literary subject but in that of the larger human collective, to what extent does the technical per se participate in what Berlant describes as the "embeddedness [of these characters] in scenes that make demands on the sensorium for adjudication, adaptation, improvisation, and new visceral John Johnston is Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Emory University.

More simply, to what extent is the technology at the heart of each novel also a determi nant of the affective mapping each offers? That is the question I want to address before turning to Berlant's central underlying theme: the role or necessity of trauma in the "crisis ordinariness" the two novels depict. As a mechanical device, the elevator instantiates what is known as a finite-state machine: that is, it can only exist in a limited number of states, with predetermined transitions from one state to another. In this instance: moving up with doors closed, moving down with doors closed, stationary at floor level with doors open (or closing). A call button outside the elevator and numbered buttons inside it send signals that initiate these tran sitions. A host of mechanical and electro-mechanical devices (and in modern elevators, digital microcontrollers) ensure that the ele vator operates smoothly and safely in accord with these finite-state functions. Since all of these devices obey well understood physical laws whose actions are easily observed and tested, the discourse of the elevator assemblage-in both actual life and Colson's The Intuitionist-is one of empiricism. The novel, however, introduces two anomalies that contest this basic principle. The first is the Intuitionist counter-discourse elaborated by the elevator innovator and theorist James Fulton. Yet it turns out, in a complicating twist, that this counter-discourse is a simulation, albeit not necessarily false. Proffered by Fulton as a black man who has successfully passed as white, this feigned discourse initially expresses his hatred of the corrupt white order, but then, ambiguously, becomes the vehicle of a utopian desire.' The second anomaly is the cata strophic free fall of an elevator from the fortieth floor in the Fanny Briggs Building, just when the city mayor is showing it off to visi tors from the French embassy. Lila Mae Watson, an avowed Intuitionist and the elevator inspector who had found it mechani cally sound only a few days before, thus finds herself at the nexus of these two anomalies. Since the multiple safety systems that prevent such a free fall had all simultaneously failed, the elevator itself (number eleven) had done the physically impossible. From the empiricist perspective, the only conceivable explanation is tampering or sabotage. Hence Lila Mae falls under suspicion: either she did it or she was set up by other perpetrators. In either case, and from the novel's outset, she is caught up in machinations generated by opposing political (and economic) forces gradually exposed by her own search for the answer to the question: what really happened? The novel's outcome will turn on the alternative Intuitionist account, or rather, on its "reading" and rewriting by Lila Mae</page><page sequence="3">American Literary History 863 herself. In contrast to the Empiricists, who for example "stoop to check for tell-tale striations on the lift winch and seize upon oxidation scars on the compensating rope sheave ..." (57), the Intuitionists, "generally sullen detective philosophers of vertical transport" (55), assume empirical knowledge of the elevator's con stituent parts and functions but do not examine them for flaws or signs of stress; instead, they experience the elevator, attend hyper attentively to the subliminal sounds and vibrations that emanate from its movements through space, that is, its transitions from state 2 to state. For Lila Mae, inspecting the elevator at 125 Walker Street in the novel's opening pages, these vibrations resolve into the play of geometric shapes in her mind's eye-in this instance an aqua blue cone circled by a red spike that doubles in size and begins to wobble as the elevator ascends. "No need to continue," she thinks, and cites the building super for a "faulty overspeed governor" (7). Significantly, the Empiricists have denigrating nick names "for their renegade colleagues: swamis, voodoo men, juju heads, witch doctors, Harry Houdinis. All terms belonging to the nomenclature of dark exotica, the sinister foreign" (57-58). Less ideological, the Intuitionists simply call their colleagues "flat-earthers, ol' nuts and bolts, stress freaks ... Babbits [and] col lators" (58). Comprising both physical machinery and the opposed dis courses of the inspectors, the technology of the elevator thus con stitutes a specific assemblage, which is in turn embedded in a dense social-political force field.3 Much of the novel in fact con sists of Lila Mae's efforts to avoid or move between the treacher ous intrigues and manipulations of her boss (who is up for re-election) and his Mafia supporters on one side, and the false haven of Intuitionist House on the other. The latter has devolved from an intellectual center where Fulton lectured to the home base of the liberal opposition candidate Oliver Lever and his campaign manager Mr. Reed, who are not at all above using her for their own purposes. More insidiously, Intuitionist House also harbors "Natchez", Lila Mae's potential and only love interest, who turns out to be an African-American industrial spy for the elevator manufacturer Arbo, just as another manufacturer, United, stands behind the Mafia-infiltrated city government. Indeed, as Ben Urich, a local journalist who has been tortured by the Mafia thugs says to Lila Mae: "Arbo and United - they're the real players here" (207). Through this maze of political and physical danger Lila Mae seeks the presence of Fulton himself, not just his unpublished notebooks which threaten the established regime but the unseen folds of his lifework. The breakthrough comes with two</page><page sequence="4">864 A Response to Laiicre;i Berlaut revelations: first, she realizes that the free fall of elevator eleven was a catastrophic accident, an event neither the Empiricist nor Intuitionist discourse could account for; and second, she discovers that Fulton was actually an African-American passing for white the signs were always there but had remained undetected. Acknowledging Fulton's anthropomorphism, she speculates that "eleven" might even have passed as "healthy" (229). Whereas Fulton's first volume (entitled Theoretical Elevators) had caused a "conversion experience" (59) in Lila Mae and presumably many others, the second had simply consolidated the Intuitionist approach. But now she can read a double meaning inscribed in the second volume: "a world he invented to parody his [white] ensla vers," but also a desire for "a perfect elevator that will lift him away from here" (241). But it is Fulton's interest in Lila Mae herself that produces a future for Intuitionism. Scribbling her name in the margins of his notebook when he sees her studying late at night in the library-a casual, thoughtless act that will later bring her into the crosshairs of the vying political factions-in effect becomes Fulton's way of passing to Lila Mae his own incomplete project: the final "writing of the elevator" (252). At the novel's conclusion, in a bare and anonymous room looking out on a factory, she assumes the role of the "keeper," striving to assimilate Fulton's voice, dribbling out notebook pages to keep the industry and city hall agents satisfied, but meanwhile preparing the citizens "for the second elevation" (255), i.e., the perfect elevator of the future no longer controlled by special interests. Gibson's Pattern Recognition, in contrast, is about the Internet, in the sense that it is primarily concerned with the "life" and kinds of experience that only a vast, global communications assemblage like the Internet makes possible.4 Unlike finite-state machines such as the elevator, the Internet is a nonlinear dynami cal system that literally exists in an infinite number of states. Its relevance to the novel stems from its global, de-centered structure and complex of layered protocols, which ensure instantaneous, utterly anonymous electronic communications from almost unloca table origins. Not surprisingly, the novel's central character, Cayce Pollard, a "'coolhunter"' and "'sensitive"' (2) handsomely paid by marketing agencies for her acute fashion sense and uncanny ability to recognize instantly whether or not a particular new logo or trademark will "work," feels truly at home only when logged on to Fetish:Footage:Forum, or F:F:F, a website that posts and maintains an archive of a series of anonymous video fragments called the Footage, as well as hosting its on-line discussion group. Though they are of haunting beauty, the 135 video fragments reveal no narrative connection or "stylistic cues"-all identifying names,</page><page sequence="5">American Literary History 865 dates, fashions, and markers of physical locales having been care fully removed. Overtly signifying very little, the fragments mostly seem enigmatic, like the one of a man standing on a platform in a station who slowly turns and raises his hand (315). Minimalist but affect-charged, the Footage appears to herald some intriguing and deeply anonymous new aesthetic. The plot traces Cayce's effort to track down its maker, who turns out to be a young Russian, Nora Volkova, suffering from a traumatic brain injury caused by a terrorist bomb that killed her parents. A student filmmaker before her injury, Nora began to experiment with images when her sister Stella noticed that only the images on the hospital video monitor brought life to her eyes. Equipped with a computer and monitor at her bedside, Nora pains takingly created the images that Stella then released onto the Internet. One image in particular embeds an enigmatic T-shape that contains a mapping of the other images; as Cayce discovers, it is also a ghostly image of the firing mechanism of the Claymore explosive device lodged precariously between the lobes of Nora's brain. Later in the novel, after watching the artist for hours use Photoshop to build up and rework "mere scraps of found video" (315), Cayce thinks of the footage as "[o]nly the wound, speaking wordlessly in the dark" (316). The discovery that some of the Footage images are water marked is what allows the artist's identity to be brought to light. This marking is a special instance of steganography, or the embed ding of hidden messages within the body of a carrier text. Indeed, this practice appears to be internalized in the mode of expression of Pattern Recognition itself. Its buried message concerns the history of the Internet and specifically the Internet's dependence upon encryption for its most important functionality. Its precursor, Arpanet, was conceived as a Cold War communication system that, thanks to its highly distributed network structure, could survive a nuclear attack, since it would continue to function even if many of its links and nodes were destroyed. Now a global com munications system, the Internet functions as a necessary instru ment of a global economy in which branding, marketing, and fashion are essential aspects. In the transformation of Arpanet into the Internet the need for secrets and their encryption not only continues but extends into other sectors, as business and civil government now follow the precursor military model. Thus an ethos of secrecy and invisible forces at play pervades the novel. Events often emerge from a cloud of information without exact cause-effect linkages, in which a ramification of multiple connections and metonymies dissolves the difference between necessity and contingency. A key instance is how Cayce</page><page sequence="6">866 A Response to Lauren Berlant is put into danger because of two unconnected facts: her whimsi cal web post to F:F:F in which she hypothetically refers to "some Russian mafia kingpin, with a bent for self-expression" (304) as a possible source of the Footage, and the fact that her father-who "went missing" in New York on 9/11-was a former CIA officer assigned to Soviet Russia. Unbeknown to her, this concatenation sets into motion protective forces around Andrei Volkova, the sisters' wealthy uncle. In instance after instance seemingly res onant information threatens to subvert or overwhelm strict narra tive logic. A woman Cayce meets in London has a job in viral marketing, as a kind of meme generator for hire; one of her assign ments, naturally, is to talk about the Footage. Indeed, Cayce's employer in London, Hubertus Bigend of Blue Ant, apparently lured by the prospect of a new marketing strategy suggested by the Footage's dispersion, is the one who hires her to find the anon ymous video artist, while others in his employ seem intent on derailing or actually harming her. While on several occasions Cayce tries to consider her father's advice "to use her paranoia," she actively rejects her mother's apophenia-"the spontaneous perception of connections and meaningfulness in unrelated things" (117). Such details nevertheless hint at ominous or uncanny con nections which may or may not be revealed. As in the fragments of film footage, narrative is always but only immanent. Diagrammatically, each Diagrammatically, each novel is thus defined by a technical novel is thus defined by assemblage, a technology and its discourse that together-or in a technical assemblage, their conjunction-enable or become the occasion of new kinds of a technology and its discourse that together- experience for the protagonist. To be sure, these assemblages do or in their conjunction- not account for everything each heroine registers, comes to be con enable or become the scious of, or reflects upon. Yet far from appearing as inert back occasion of new kinds of ground for the characters' actions or as mere details in the experience for the historical decor of the novels, they provide the very condition of protagonist. possibility and larger context of what is new and singular in their experiences. Whereas Lila Mae learns to extend her elevator intui tionism to her affective experience more globally, Cayce homes in on the Footage as if it were a strange attractor in a sea of infor mation patterns, "recognition" here simply designating a form of deep affective resonance. Considered from this perspective, Berlant's essay raises the specific question of to what extent "affect" floats within and circu lates across these assemblages and the structures they articulate and support. Briefly, in the machinic language my approach implies, affect would be the human body's way of living the tran sition from one state to another, including the transition to a wholly new set of states and corresponding new sensorium. There is no direct, one-to-one correspondence, but-in accord with</page><page sequence="7">American Literary History 867 Maturana and Varela' s perturbation theory-a generalized mapping or structural coupling of two quasi-autonomous systems.5 Little surprise, from this perspective, that Lila Mae, living in a state of logical (and ideological) lockdown within binary opposi tions (black-white, liberal-authoritarian) and thus a paucity of possible states, has been a "practicing solipsist" (235) all her life, her face a constructed mask or screen through which the affects of others are scrutinized and assessed. Intuitionism, beyond elevator diagnosis, offers an opening onto and passage toward "another world beyond this one" (134), i.e., another set of states. Little sur prise either that Cayce, living within and across the diffusions and quasi-random drifts of a nebulous information space-hence an excess of possible states-is viscerally "allergic to fashion" (8), phobic and neurasthenically sensitive to certain trademarks like the Michelin Man, which are stolid, turgid, immobile, heavy, in short, overcoded. Yet Berlant does more than simply foreground affect as a new critical focus, by demonstrating that from such registrations of affect as are evident in these novels we can learn to recognize and chart the singularities of experience that define our present, both in its historical determinations and still-forming vectors of becoming different and unknown. Along these vectors, I would add, affect may be our only guide as we enter not yet fully experience-able zones and attempt to confront the yet-to-be-theorized collapse of Erlebnis and Erfahrung. In any event, in making the case for the necessity of affective mapping, Berlant also moves toward a syn thesized completion of several strands of contemporary theoretical discourse, including Marxist historicism, everyday life theory, and a renovated trauma studies. As a consequence, her argument for a full accounting of affect completes and forces to a new level the current practice of literary analysis, including my own reading of the novels, which starts from the priority of the technological but just as easily could have begun by prioritizing the economic political, the sexual-racial, or the ideological-historical. In each case such an orientation would have to be completed-perhaps even contested-by careful study of affect and its circulation through the lived spaces of our present. Let me conclude quickly with a single example. As Berlant shows, evidence of trauma pervades both novels, particularly Pattern Recognition: Nora' s literally traumatic brain injury, Cayce' s peculiar phobias and sensitivities and the powerfully felt present absence of her father, and of course, in the back ground, 9/11. But there is no trauma that exhibits the clear struc ture that Cathy Carruth has elucidated, based on Freud and the concept of deferred, retrospective action (Nachtraglickheit), where</page><page sequence="8">868 A Response to Laiureni Berlant a recent or present event (re)animates a buried shock-event from the past, crystallizing a too soon/too late structure of response that evacuates the present, leaving the subject in the hiatus between an endlessly deferred present and future replays of an incomplete and eviscerated experience, with the consequence that the subject falls into the malaise of dead time. Contrarily, it is the affective singularity evident in the two novels that forces Berlant to elaborate another way of understand ing trauma, in close relation to "crisis ordinariness"-that is, the crisis of and within the ordinary-simply in order to read the experiences of the two heroines. Berlant shows that because both Cayce and Lila Mae are acutely open to affect-to experiencing the vast tumult of the world as it impinges on their skins and nervous systems-they gradually acquire the capacity to work their way into the present, to knot themselves into what is happening now. In both cases this wider area of contact with the world through the expanded sensorium makes the difference. Whereas initially Lila Mae is living in a state of guarded self-protection and Cayce one of highly selective drift (she only chooses how to drift)-both being styles of what Berlant calls "defensive impersonality"-their respective searches bring about the possi bility of a change of state that both succeed in taking advantage of. For Cayce it results in what Berlant calls a "reachievement of interiority"; for Lila Mae, it is a becoming-Fulton-not an identifi cation with or repetition of him but a relay of his desire for a better world that enables her to begin living her own time. Thus these characters do not merely survive their experience, living on as trauma victims in the aporias of Nachtraglickheit. Rather, they become active sign-detectors in the historical stream of Bergsonian duree, forced to insert themselves into that becoming in order to move beyond a past that was never theirs and into a present that now is. Notes 1. As a technology, the elevator makes viable the tall building or "skyscraper" that immediately became a symbol of the modernist utopia. Berlant rightly calls attention to the racist, sexist, and authoritarian 'underside' of this utopia, which the novel relentlessly exposes in its depiction of Lila Mae's actual experience. Yet this Utopian desire remains active or, more accurately, is reactivated in Lila Mae's project at the novel's conclusion. 2.
