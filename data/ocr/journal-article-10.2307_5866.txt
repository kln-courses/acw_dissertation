It may not have been possible to predict the evolution of human beings from obser- vations on the primordial soup had we been there as observers because there were too many possible outcomes of evolution. But now having the outcome we ought to be able to work backwards to understand the functioning of humans in terms of the laws of chemistry and physics. I admit that there may be prob- lems with the emergence of rationality; Popper has grappled with this but, in my view, not too satis- factorily! The point, though, is that throughout the his- tory of biology, where gaps have been identified be- tween levels they have often been filled with vital spirits and forces that are mysterious and, by definition, non-scientific. Now I am sure that Peters himself does not intend this vitalism, but there is a slippery slope from holism and organismic biology to vitalism down which many a biologist, including such 'greats' as Aristotle and Bertalanffy, have fallen, and Gaian ghosts do now lurk in the byways of ecology, so again care is needed. Having written all this I do have to end by admitting a personal sympathy with a top down approach, but with emphasis on the down. I am concerned, though, that the persuasiveness with which Peters writes and the way that, in the latter chapters of his book, he links his argument to prescriptions for education may mislead. Those fresh to ecology need to be protected from the seductive excesses of holism! PETER CALOW P. J. B. Slater &amp; T. R. Halliday (Eds) (1994) Behaviour and Evolution. Pp. 348. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. ?16.95 (paperback) ISBN 0-521-42923-4 ?37.50 (hard- back) ISBN 0-521-41858-5. Behaviour and Evolution seeks to explore the exciting recent advances at the interface between animal behaviour and the study of evolution. The cover announces that the book will be invaluable to senior undergraduates and graduate students of biology and psychology. It is a book of some 300 pages of text. The nine chapters are written by 10 authors, seven of whom are based in the UK and two of whom have acted as the editors. The chapter titles indicating the major topics covered in the book are: Behaviour gen- etics and evolution; Behaviour and speciation; The phylogeny of behaviour; Strategies of behaviour; Sex and evolution; Kinship and altruism; The evolution of intelligence; Social structure and evolution. On the whole, the editors have done a good job in standardizing the style and depth of the different chapters, which are in general well written and easy to assimilate. A few figures are rather poorly repro- duced or the legends are incomplete and not self- explanatory. Splitting of figures across non-facing pages also seems a peculiar strategy. The pen and ink illustrations by Priscilla Barrett are a welcome addition. There are a surprising number of niggling errors of the proof-reading variety: my favourites are 'when the sizes live separately, some mechanism is required to bring males and females together to mate' (p. 270) and the citation of Darwin (1959) on p. 83. The latter is quite apposite since the introductory chapter is rounded off with the comment that had Charles Darwin been alive today the evolution of behaviour would surely have been his field. I am not so certain; I rather suspect that molecular genetics and developmental mechanisms would have figured more within his scope of interest. I am not convinced that this book would lead many budding researchers with an evolutionary bent to concentrate on research sys- tems involving behavioural traits. Whilst most principles are well explained, some material might not be clear to undergraduates coming across it for the first time. On the other hand, I am not convinced that this book represents indispensable reading for many graduate students. How would a student interested primarily in evolution relate to this book? Would he or she immediately think: why not approach their particular interest by concentrating on a trait or system of importance in animal behaviour? My own suspicion is that both these questions would meet a rather negative response. Many very exciting areas of evolutionary biology are little touched upon here. I think in particular of the contributions of a fuller understanding of developmental mechanisms, of the analysis of selection and lifetime reproductive success in natural populations, of the role of pheno- typic plasticity and norms of reaction in evolutionary adaptation, of life-history evolution and the role of constraints. On the other hand, there are major excep- tions: the topic of speciation is covered well and in an informative way by Butlin &amp; Ritchie. The chapter on phylogenetic analysis of behaviour by Gittleman &amp; Decker could find a central place in many textbooks on evolution. The evolution of sex certainly remains an important topic in biology but I am not sure the contribution in this book would add anything to descriptions in evolutionary textbooks. Having mentioned the generally high standard of the writing, I can now mention the downside of multi- authored volumes. There is an inevitable variability in sharpness of the contributions and some selectivity to the topics covered. There is some 'bittyness' to the treatment and one gains the impression that this is not a very comprehensive coverage of the subject; topics such as the physiological basis of behaviour, pred- ator-prey interactions, the evolution of signal-receiver systems and the interactions between behaviour and population structure seem to me to be under- represented. Moreover, the use of examples is also selective. Some topics seem to be top heavy on ver- tebrate examples while a few are heavily biassed towards invertebrates. This presumably reflects a 792 Book Reviews ? 1995 British Ecological Society, Journal of Animal Ecology, 64, 787-794</page><page sequence="2">combination of the research interests of the authors and the material used within the particular field. As someone who only comparatively rarely ven- tures into first-hand research involving animal behav- iour, I found much of value in this book, as I am sure undergraduates and graduates would too. However, it would be interesting to be able to ask Charles Dar- win for his own thoughts! PAUL M. BRAKEFIELD C. A. Spinage (1994) Elephants. Pp. xvi+319. T. &amp; A. D. Poyser Ltd, London, UK ?25. ISBN 0-85661-088-7. Although it is not apparent from the book itself, this is one of a series of natural history volumes, which Poyser has recently taken over from the previous pub- lishers. There has been a rash of elephant books over the last decade and one might ask what is new about this one. As far as the biology of the elephant is con- cerned, there is nothing that is not already well known, but in the degree of detail of the history of man's relationship with elephants, this book is unique. Dr Spinage has one of the best private collections of books on elephants and there is little that he does not known about them. His approach is scholarly and meticulous and one can be sure that if he gives a date in antiquity it will be the correct one. Similarly, one can rely on biological information being factually accurate. It is a pity, therefore, that the text is not referenced in the usual way to enable the reader to follow up some of the assertions made. If the omission of references is the policy of the series editor, then the book is not appropriate to the series. There are full, although not exhaustive, chapter by chapter reference lists at the back of the book, but it is not always clear to which publication a particular statement refers as the names of the researchers are not given (unless they have died, preferably at least a century ago!). In some cases with which I am familiar, the appropriate ref- erence is not cited in the bibliography. The book is divided into 15 chapters that combine biological and historical detail. The first chapter, which deals with the evolution of the order Probos- cidea, is one of the least satisfactory and I wonder if a reader unfamiliar with the subject would feel fully informed. A few illustrations of members of the extinct families would have helped to make the various relationships clearer. Some statements are misleading if not incorrect, e.g. 'The mastodons of the family Mammutidae were allied to the true elephants rather than to the mammoths.' Surely the woolly mammoth was a true elephant? The anatomy and physiology of the elephant are dealt with competently, with little nuggets of detail, such as the record weight of a gall stone. The chapter on reproduction is slightly more anthropomorphic than one would expect from a scien- tist, and it is a pity that the modern trend is followed of not distinguishing between 'suck' and 'suckle'. The life history and disease risks occupy a couple of chap- ters and a third is devoted to the elephant's social life. This is a reliable and up-to-date account although I wonder if 'incontinence' is an altogether accurate word to describe the dribbling of urine by the musth male. This probably is not involuntary but has the function of advertising the elephant's reproductive status. A chapter on feeding leads into the puzzling question of tree destruction by elephants. The author considers the various possible reasons but, perhaps wisely, does not decide in favour of any particular hypothesis. Over-population is probably a factor and several case histories are considered, although it might have been better to have discussed these after, rather then before, the chapter on population dynamics. There are two excellent chapters on ivory and the ivory trade, which, as one might expect, are covered in great detail. The final chapter is concerned with the domestication of elephants and shows that the African species is every bit as trainable as the Asian. It is indeed surprising that more use has not been made of African elephants for transporting national parks' visitors on game-viewing trips. The book is well illustrated with pleasing line draw- ings by Larry Norton, who has also contributed an evocative painting for the frontispiece of a huge tusker. There are many black and white photographs scattered throughout the book as well as a group of coloured plates. Since only a few of these carry attributions, the others are presumably by the author, who is well known as an accomplished photographer. This is a distinguished contribution to the literature on elephants. It is well written and a pleasure to read, with the factual information laced with anecdotal detail. This enlivens the text even though there may be some repetition, e.g. the story about the slaughter of the Asian bull by cannon shot in Geneva in 1820, which is recounted on p. 73 and again on p. 273. The book is full of reliable information and can act as a reference volume as well as a text to be read through from beginning to end, but anyone dipping into it to check a fact is likely to submit to temptation and continue reading far beyond the original page consulted. An additional bonus is that by today's standards, it is relatively cheap. It can be thoroughly recommended. S. K. ELTRINGHAM D. Brown &amp; P.
