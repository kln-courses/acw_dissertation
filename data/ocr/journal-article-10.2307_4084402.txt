London, Collins Sons. 288 pp., 1 color photo, 15 black-and-white photos, 8 figs., 6 maps, 5 appendices fol- lowed by 24 tables. ? 3.50.-Many avian researchers pick a species that is easy to study, define a specific problem, gather the required data, and publish a short report of the work. This process has been fruitful, but Nethersole-Thompson has spent his life using quite a different approach. He prefers to select species that are difficult to study, define the species as the problem, spend years collecting data, and then culminate his work with the publication of a monograph. The present book is the third such monograph published by the author, and his results verify the validity of his technique. Nethersole-Thompson has spent over 30 years observing Dotterels (Eudromias morinellus) in the Highlands of Scotland, and this book summarizes his findings and includes the observations of many other researchers. Adam Watson and Raymond Parr present a special section on "Timing of reproduction in Dotterel and Ptarmigan" and D. A. Ratcliffe contributes two chapters dealing with "Breeding habitat of the Dotterel in Britain" and "The Dotterel as a breeding bird in England." The book contains essentially everything known about this elusive species. The first three chapters serve as a historical introduction, with the past persecu- tion of the Dotterel described and the effects of egg collectors evaluated. Chapters 4 through 12 comprise a detailed description of breeding biology and behavior. The data are presented in a popularized style, with Nethersole-Thompson frequently using anthropomorphic phrases such as "cock Dotterels are sometimes lusty" and terms like "nest dancing" in place of the terminology used by other researchers. Also, a selected bibliography is used and at times it is hard to tell whether a reference is based on personal correspondence or a specific publication. For instance, D. F. Parmelee is quoted, but he has two citations in the bibliography. Chapters 13-20 deal with population densities, habitat preferences, feeding ecology, and breeding status throughout the Dotterel's range. Chapters 15 and 20 both deal predominantly with breeding ranges and they could have been combined.</page><page sequence="2">934 Reviews [Auk, Vol. 90 In Chapter 21 the future of the Dotterel is discussed. The appendices include records of this species in Scotland and England, and information on plumages and parasites. The tables provide a wealth of information in support of statements in the text. The detailed index includes scientific names of animal species mentioned in the text. Throughout the book numerous speculations are presented dealing with the adap- tive significance of Dotterel behavior. The Dotterel has sex role reversal and is polyandrous. Nethersole-Thompson speculates that sex role reversal may have evolved because females could not meet the energy demands of both egg-laying and parental duties during frequent, harsh environmental conditions. Once females were freed from parental duties, he speculates that they would lay additional clutches when- ever possible. The author relies on identifying individual females by the coloration patterns of the eggs they lay, and based upon my own work with the Mountain Plover, I feel this is a risky technique. I think, therefore, that many details of the Dotterel social system need to be confirmed with marked birds. Although the popularized style does pose some problems, the information presented should be of value to the researcher and to those concerned with the breeding status of the Dotterel. Everyone should enjoy the excellent photos and bird enthusiasts in general will find this an easy-reading and informative book.-WALTER D. GRAUL.</page></plain_text>
