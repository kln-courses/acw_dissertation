<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK NOTICES judicious selection of quotations (mostly) from Peirce's Collected papers, it is clear that S's real heroes are the 'Baltic Baron' biologist Jacob von Uexkiill (1864-1944) and the French mathematician Rend Thom (b. 1923)- particularly the latter, whom S considers a modern-day successor to Peirce. The first half of the book is rich in material para- phrasing and drawing upon a vast bibliog- raphy of items in various subfields of biology, with a particular focus on the relationship between animal communication (' zoosemiotic systems') in general and human communication ('anthropomorphic systems') specifically. These essays all comport well with S's over-all research outlook, which seeks to widen the scope of what he insists on calling a field to include 'the whole of oikoumene, the entirety of our planetary biosphere' (63). The sheer number of names and works marshaled in support of this ambitious program is truly mind-boggling. (There are, however, three significant omissions: the linguists Henning Andersen and Raimo Anttila, and the ornithologist Luis Baptista.) Part II ('The masters') is a series of eight essays, all but one of which (on the connection between Peirce and Saussure) are calculated to memorialize scholars who have contributed to the 'science of signs' in greater or lesser degree and with whom S feels a particular affinity: Uexkiill, Gyula Laziczius, Roman Jakobson, John Lotz, and Joseph Greenberg. In the case of the latter three linguists (with one of whom S shares a Hungarian back- ground), the account relies on personal acquaintance of long standing. S motivates his singling out of men whose impact on inquiry into semiosis is hardly commensurable by (once again) widening the compass of the word 'masters', in a double meaning to embrace 'any agent that utters and any patient that interprets [a sign], any organism, be it man, woman, child, speechless creature ... in short, you or me' (xiii). One of the distinctive features of S's approach to his subject is an eschewal of critical controversy. The 'ecumenicalism' which he advocates (61-83) is evidently incompatible with partis pris. Nevertheless, he occasionally allows some sort of value judgment, albeit in attenuated form, e.g. when obliquely taking issue with Eco's utterly misguided attempt at 'debunking' Peirce's notion of icon (115)-or when assessing (though quite erroneously) Jakobson's grounds in taking sides in a dispute between two former students (227). The book is splendidly produced, and has the welcome feature of being supplied with many photographs and illustrations. [MICHAEL SHAPIRO, UCLA.] Language and style. By E. L. EPSTEIN. London: Methuen, 1978. Pp. xii, 92. Cloth $12.50, paper $5.95. Epstein's short work offers a concise discussion of a number of topics contained within the vast realm of literary 'style'. Chap. I is dominated by the question of the perception of personal style; here E presents a schema (6-7) whereby each apperceptive level of style 'acts as the identificative dimension of the succeeding level', enabling the perceiver to perform increasingly refined detective work and attribution. Chap. II, 'Types of linguistic criticism', relies on speech-act theory to help determine the characterization of styles through such features as 'rhetorical' questions. Chaps. III-IV grapple with the central thesis of the book, which is an attempt to demarcate public and private stylistic elements, often resulting in a conflation of privateness and uniqueness (which I would roughly define as a single instance of the 'public' elements). This commitment to the impossible task of clearly segregating shared, public patterns of articulation from intonation, phonology, and syntax leads E to assert, for example, the 'comparative lack of intonational structures in the acoustic texture of casual conversation' (40) as compared with those in poetry. (This statement is puzzling in view of the depend- ence of the casual utterance, such as Mm-hmm, upon intonation for almost its entire signific- ance.) According, to E, such features as transition difficulties, excesses of information words with a concomitant increase in major stresses, 'emergency' phonology (41), and a paralinguistic slowing of tempo explain the obstructed style of performance of difficult poetry (including that of silent reading). Insofar as the distinction between form and content can be clear at all, it does not actually coincide with, but cuts across, the distinction between what is style and what is not. Style would then comprise characteristic features both of what is said and of how it is said. If it 477</page><page sequence="2">LANGUAGE, VOLUME 56, NUMBER 2 (1980) is obvious that 'style is the regard that the how pays to the what' (1), the faults of that formula are equally obvious. Architecture, non-objective painting, and most of music have no subject, nor do they literally say anything. So the 'what' of one activity may be part of the 'how' of another. No rule based on linguistic form alone could determine, for example, whether or not a discursive meaning is ironic (in whole or part). This undecid- ability is in turn intrinsic to the correlations between linguistic levels themselves: as higher-level phenomena are reached, cor- relations between levels become increasingly indeterminate, because the relations between the levels are increasingly liable to asymmet- ries and variabilities that are not strictly rule- governed. Since each way of saying may in fact be the saying of a different thing-notwithstanding E. D. Hirsch's recent attempt to defend the existence of perfect synonymy (' Stylistics and synonymy,' Critical Inquiry 1.559-79 [1975])- E's tendency to help resurrect the notion of synonymy through affiliation with trans- formational linguistics tends to weaken his grasp of the interrelatability even of linguistic levels. His frequent use of the verb mime could profitably be replaced by that of a term such as diagram, which would posit conceptual interrelation rather than causality. His analyses often imply that form varies while content remains constant. The different 'actualizations of deep structure' (55) lead him to posit a 'semi-grammaticality' in cases of statistically-rare lexical or syntactic choices. This theoretical bias also dilutes his other- wise apt critique of other writers on style (such as Riffaterre and Chatman, 72-5) who follow a similar lead. It soon emerges from reading this book that the relation between form and content must be described metaphorically. There can be no fixed catalog of the elementary proper- ties of style, since we are concerned with the prismatic problem of the 'SYMBOLIC func- tioning of the work as such' (Nelson Good- man, 'The status of style,' CI 1.808 [1975]). The features that uncover it may be character- istic of an author, period, school, or place; but most importantly, they are 'tropes of meaning' (Michael Shapiro, 'Toward a global theory of style', MS). E's book meets the challenge of posing provocative questions within a restricted space, and provides useful orientation to those less accustomed to considering style from a systematic point of view.
