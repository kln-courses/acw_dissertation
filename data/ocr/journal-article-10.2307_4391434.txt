<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHRONIQUE BIBLIOGRAPHIQUE JAMES W. FERNANDEZ and RENATE L. FERNANDEZ Fang Reliquary Art: Its Quantities and Qualities* The Fang of western Equatorial Africa (Gabon, Rio Muni and southern Came- roun) were one of the most publicized African peoples in the mid and late nineteenth century. Their 'noble savagery' was widely featured and their 'anthropophagy' expounded, in the extant journals of popular exploration: Globus, Tour du Monide, Petermanns Mitteilungen. Their irresistible advance out of the interior plateau down to the coast inspired fear in coastal peoples and impressed European traders and colonizers. By the mid-twentieth century these Fang reliquary figures (bieri) have come to achieve their due place in the catalogues and art books of African art. Fang is one of the best known of African art styles-a style of such powerful yet limited range as to be readily recognizable. It catches our attention. Indeed these figures, among their other purposes, were intended to inspire caution in those uninitiated into the ancestor cult; the steady gaze of the eyes,, often accen- tuated by metallic discs, is arresting. The locking of the arms across the chest" or their symmetrical extension toward the belly, the squareness of presentation, the crouch of the legs, all suggest unambiguous power in alert repose. 'Hieratic meditation' is a term often used to describe the posture of these figures, but they impose themselves more forcefully than that. Fang Statuary in Its Quantities: One Style Center or Two We have not, until recently, had a careful morphological study of the distri- bution of styles in Fang 'bieri carvings'. Now Louis Perrois has advanced such a study, Statuaire Fan, Gabon and an ethnological summary of 272 of these carvings. We would like to review in some detail this thick and generally useful book, for the hypothesis of style dynamics it puts forth is questionable and in some ways it misrepresents the ethnographic facts in its enthusiasm for morpho-analysis. The ethnographic facts, after all, are what is basic in explaining the diversity in Fang styles. As always the attachment of numbers to complex aesthetic phenomena, or their entrapment through some scheme of categorization, however refined, can beguile us into supposing that we grasp what is still well beyond our reach. * Our Gabon work was funded by the Foreign Area program of the Ford Foundation I958-I96I. We thank Don Jorge Sabater Pi for providing details on the carvers of Rio Muni. i. The Perrois study in the section on {Decomposition des 6l6ments morpho- logiques' shows that 104 out of the 272 carvings employ metal discs for the eyes. 2.

FERNANDEZ AND RENATE L. FERNANDEZ Numbers must be attached and categories must be constructed but we should not lay supine before them. Nor should we fool ourselves that the morphological approach has much to do with the creation and appreciation of the artifacts themselves. Perrois hypothesizes two great centers of the Fang style. We shall argue for one style center with a persistence of archaic forms on the periphery, as well as variations in the diffusion of style into the periphery. To begin with the figures in Perrois' study, in the great majority, come from European and American collections. Very few of them have accurate attributions. Moreover the active carving of these figures is virtually defunct. Thus Perrois, who is Director of Research in the Arts and Traditions Museum in Libreville, was obliged to tour the Gabon countryside seeking to elicit from old men (he showed them eighteen representative photos) judgments as to which of the sub-styles were characteristic of their area and their sub-tribe: Ngumba, Ntumu, Okak Nzaman-Betsi, or Mvai. Given the high degree of mobility of the Fang up until the Second World War, this is a chancy method of linking style to sub-tribe. For example, village families (ndebot) which have settled, say, along the Okano River in the south among the Betsi, may have moved down from Ntumu country in the Woleu Ntem basin a generation or two previously. The judgments of old men along the Okano may have been based on stylistic preferences learned form their forebears who were then living in the Ntumu country. Perrois gives no evidence of informing himself in every case of the migratory antecedents of his informants. He does give a general account of sub-tribal migrations but tends to identify them with those of one clan. In cases where the style of a figure seems anomalous for its area he does check into genealogical antecedents to explain, by recent migration, the anomaly. We will return to this difficulty below. The point is that Perrois tends to reify the sub-tribe among Fang. It is a designation that has weak institutional support in tradition and was, until recent years, of more reality and utility to Europeans as a category than to Fang. The grouping concepts that have had dominant reality for Fang are the house group (ndebot), the village group (mvokabot), the string of villages (abiale bot or etungabot) and the dispersed clan (ayong). Recurrently in their history Fang have sought to knit clans together (alar-ayong) (Fernandez 1970:428-440), though the fission of clans into new clans has been the greater reality. The same clans or commonly derived clans are found in several sub-tribal areas, and not only clan Bokwe as listed by Perrois. Holding these matters in abeyance for the moment, let us consider sample of carvings upon which Perrois has drawn, the universe from which they came, and then the major conclusions he has derived from them. It is reasonable to suppose that his 272 pieces are a representative sample that comprises at the least 20 percent of the total extant collection of Fang ancestor pieces. Unfortunately he made little effort to consult Spanish collections, both public and private, which would have given him, perhaps, another 200 figures for analysis-pieces, moreover, with better attributions, by and large, and deriving from an area of particularly intense Fang aesthetic production: the borderland of Gabon, Rio Muni, and the Cameroun. Our own estimate-based on research in Gabon in the late I95os-is that, on the average, there appeared one carver of quality for every 30-40 villages, or one carver for every three to four thousand population. No traditional schools of carving have been identified, and only late under colonial pressure, have carving schools appeared at all. Fang carvers, as Perrois remarks, were never profession- alized. Carving was always a specialty of a man who, except when he became old, had regular subsistence activities to attend to. Our own view is that the output of these 'specialists' was low. On an average they cannot have produced much more than a dozen figures in their lifetimes (Fernandez I973:I99). Even under pressure to commercialize, the Fang sculptors of the I940S and I950s worked slowly (ibid.). We may (generously) estimate, taking Fang population as 200,000</page><page sequence="3">CHRONIQUE BIBLIOGRAPHIQUE 725 and numerically stable despite migration for the last two centuries, and taking a generation as 25 years, that at the maximum a grand total of 4,ooo quality carvings could have been produced by Fang from I750 to 1950 (we have no indication that any extant figure is older than two centuries). About a quarter of these have found their way into western collections, perhaps a thousand. The great majority of carvings succumbed to the equatorial environment (termites, carpenter mites, humidity and decay), to cultural accidents (hut conflagration, loss in migration), and social movements (the periodic anti-witchcraft and fetish movements) of which the last, the Mademoiselle or Ndende movement in northern Gabon of 1955-I958, destroyed hundreds (Fernandez and Bekale I962). Lest we ourselves be conquered by numbers, we put these figures forth as an educated guess perhaps-but a guess all the same. When one says quality carvings and quality carvers one should be clear that these were not the only kind produced by the Fang. They recognized quality in carving and carvers," but the egalitarian nature of Fang culture was such that men might feel a passing competence in almost all of its aspects. The range of styles and the relative crudity of a large proportion of figures obtained in the field collections of Tessmann, Grebert and ourselves4 show the degree to which the majority of the figures were carved by inexperienced men. . . men who, no doubt in the heat of village separation and in the removal of their share of skulls from the old reliquary, carved their own figures for the new reliquary. The total universe of Fang carving over the last two hundred years must have been much larger than the quality universe, at least on the order of two to one.5 It should be clear then that the sample of carvings Perrois examines is only about 3 percent of the total universe of Fang reliquary figures produced since 1750. No blame attaches to him for the smallness of this number. In the end, in most studies of African art, we deal with elite productions. It is simply useful to recognize that fact from time to time. But there is a deeper question. Perrois did not exhaustively study all the Fang figures in the collections from which he draws his catalog: the Musee de l'Homme and the Volkerkunde Museums of Berlin and Hamburg, to mention the most important ones. In other words even in extant collections there are questions of his acceptance or rejection of figures into his catalog. Was there a qualitative principle of selection which tended toward confirmation of his hypothesis? We do not know.' But as always, the null hypothesis is not confronted when sampling is selective and not random. 3. Except in recent decades, and unlike the case of the recognized masters of Yorubaland or the famous master carver of the Baluba stools, it is hard to identify one hand at work in a series of old Fang statues. Fang do not seem to have put special pressure on quality carvers. We cannot be absolutely sure, however, as the evidence is uncertain. When, however, Perrois says no Fang statue is anonymous (I972: 35) he seems to imply that they were all carved by recognized or remembered carvers. Our data show that when a statue remains in use over several generations, like the skulls in the reliquary, it loses its attribution and becomes anonymous. 4. TESSMANN I913, II: I1O-I20; GREBERT I948: 79. We made a collection of eleven pieces for the Lowie Museum of the University of California at Berkeley, during I959-60. At the same time we collected nine pieces now in our private collection, all dating from the late I930S to the early I950S. Our observation here is also based on the crudity of most of the reliquary figures brought forth to be burned in the Ndende anti-witchcraft movement of 1957-58. 5. Every extended family (ndebot) desired its reliquary. Taking fifty people as the maximum size of the ndebot (and two ndebot as the average village and hence two reliquaries) the total need of reliquary figures at any one time (200,000/50) was 4000. With a replacement rate of one quarter, or one thousand, per generation twice as many reliquary figures were needed as could be produced by quality carvers. 6. This observation is based on our visit in late I960 and early 1961 to many European Museums and collections: Musee de i'Homme, the Volkerkunde Museums II</page><page sequence="4">726 JAMES W. FERNANDEZ AND RENATE L. FERNANDEZ Let us turn to Perrois' major conclusions; to the morphological theory by which he is guided. He divides Fang styles into two large divisions: north and south. Within the north the sub-divisions are Ngumba and Ntumu. Within the South the sub-divisions are Nzaman-Betsi, Okak, Mvai, and lastly the Betsi heads alone. These styles, in outline form, are shown in Fig. i (taken from Perrois, p. 62). Perrois then carefully examines fourteen morphological traits7 for each of the carvings included in the catalog. The major variables in his view, however, and the ones upon which he relies to place each of the carvings in a style category, reside almost entirely in the first three of the fourteen characteristics. First is the proportion of the length of the trunk and neck of the figure to the total height; in this regard there are three types, the long, the middle, and the short trunk. These proportions he intends to express mathematically, but the means he employs are not conventional, nor are they clearly correlated with schematic drawings adjacent to his formulas-which would have emerged easily had he employed a grid. We restate him according to our understanding: Morphological trait #I relates trunk (t) to total height of figure (f). Type i t&lt;.4f Type 2 .4f?t(.5f Type 3 t,&gt;5f Morphological trait #2 relates total figure height (f) to length of head (h) and to length of legs (g). Eight types are distinguished but are not ordered in a perceivable logical fashion. One example suffices: Type 8 h&lt;.2f and g.4h Morphological trait #3 relates neck to total figure height and falls into two types, short and long, but his equation is mystifying: Type i = neck&lt;o.8/io Because he mixes fractions and decimals, uses equation signs inappropriately, and fails to graph against a uniform scale the catalog appears both more complicated and confusing than necessary. The secondary morphological traits deal in turn with aspects of face, head, hair, arms, and legs. They are distinguished into 5, 7, 9, 6, and 4 types respectively. The remaining morphological elements refer to secondary details of mouth, nose, ears, eyes, navel, breast, and genitals, and fall into 6, 5, 6, 7, 4, and 8 types respectively. Accordingly, every carving is systematically assigned 14 digits. In seven pages he is then able to tabulate his inventory of figures, grouping them according to sub-style, named by sub-tribe, and variations of proportion. From an analysis of the first three morphological traits, Perrois then distin- guishes four major theoretical styles: the hyperlongiforme in which the trunk and neck together take up more than half of the body length; lcngiforme in which trunk and neck combined are about equal to the length of legs and heads combined; dquiforme in which trunk and neck are equal to 2/3 the combined total of head and legs; brdviforme in which head, trunk and neck and legs are divided approxi- mately into thirds. hyperlongiforme t+ n&gt; .5f longiforme t+n.5f equiforme t+l-n=2/3 (g-+-h) br6viforme f - t+n n_g of Hamburg, K6ln, Lubeck, Leipzig, Berlin, Stuttgart and Tubingen, as well as private collections, and both the Barcelona and Madrid Ethnographic Museums. At all of these sites we photographed, purchased photos, or drew Fang carvings, took measurements, and obtained profiles as well as frontal views. 7. Certain morphological elements are left blank for a number of the carvings depicted in the catalog. In the case of carvings taken from Tessmann this is understandable, for a large part of his collection was destroyed during the Second World War. In the case of sketches or photos of carvings taken from exhibition catalogs this lack is less understandable.</page><page sequence="5">~~~~~~~ S c 1 e FIG. i. - Fang Styles. These carvings are not of similar height as the tracing of Perrois' ideal types (p. 62: a Ngumba; b Ntumu; c Nzaman-Betsi; d Okak; e Mvai) might suggest. He scaled them against a common one hundred percent represen- tation of their height in order to demonstrate the relative distribution of proportion. The absence of common viewpoint makes it difficult however to evaluate volume. Therefore we have altered Perrois' presentation by adding two frontal views (a,, b1) of carvings that are similar to his figures a and b.</page><page sequence="6">cwi~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1 ..

FERNANDEZ Within the category of brdviforme he distinguishes a sub-style in which the trunk is of notable stoutness, this he calls brdviforme trapu. As can be seen in Fig. 2 (from Perrois, p. 54), it is the length of the neck, the size of the head, and the size and presentation of the legs that make the essential difference. We note, though Perrois does not call attention to it, that the proportion of the trunk only total height-without inclusion of the neck-is not marked from one type to another. And while he distinguishes breviforme trapu he does not acknowledge the part that volume differences play within the other categories. We consider volume to be a crucial stylistic variable and would urge it be formally included in a morphological analysis. Perrois often enough finds it difficult to distinguish between longiforme and dquiforme, so that he sometimes employs the secondary characteristics to aid in assigning category. In effect, where measurements fail him, hel relies on cluster associations like carved cup or horn to assign a figure to the Ngumba; the shape of the navel to tip a figure toward Okak rather than to Nzaman-Betsi; the hair style to assign a figure to the Mvai. Nevertheless these accessory characteristics (not surprisingly) do not suffice at all times. Thus a characteristic that he calls idealized realism, and which he attributes to the Okak is, after all, a composite of shapes, an emergent type, and cannot be assigned by reference to his fourteen morphological elements at all. Nevertheless, he forces his theoretical framework onto the collection of figures by joining the proportions of length-arrived at more or less mathematically-to sub-tribal designation. He names the style types: Ngumba with its respective hyper-, longi-, and dquiforme sub-types; Ntumu similarly divided; Nzaman-Betsi with sub-types brdvi- and briviforme trapu; Okak; Mvai; and then the Betsi heads alone. Lastly he presents us with a category of Pahouinized carvings. He does not arrive at a model composite of each type, but provides enough information that the reader is likely to construct his own. We do not wish to tax the reader any further with the indices of proportion nor the style elements-the qualitative quantification-which Perrois develops. What we wish mainly to question is his application of sub-tribal designations to these styles. Consequently we would question his version of the dynamic historical evolution of the Fang styles. As stated above one may too readily overemphasize sub-tribal entities which have not, in the past, been very meaningful to Fang themselves. They recognized the designations Okak, Mvai, Ntumu, etc.-and there were ethnocentric feelings bound up in them-but these groups did not come together to fight or celebrate, marry or not marry, include or exclude anything on that basis alone. Beyond that, we would like to offer an alternate hypothesis for the dynamic development of Fang ancestor figure styles. This hypothesis is inductive in the first instance because it arises out of our experience with Fang carvers, and it is deductive in the second instance for we seek to apply it to clearly attributed carvings. First of all, let us consider in Fig. 3 three statues carved for us over a period of six months in I959 by Mabale Eye of Nkolabona village (Oyem District, clan Essangi). It is true that this carver, living as he does on the road between Oyem and Mitzik in the southern portion of the Woleu Ntem basin, works (or worked) in a stylistic border area, recognized by Perrois as between the Ntumu longiforme to the north and the Nzaman-Betsi briviforme to the south (see map, Fig. 4). However, we know from Mabale Eye's genealogical history that his father had lived in the heart of Ntumu country, and that his forbears had lived close to Bitam, in Koumasi. Mabale Eye was about sixty-five years old in I959. The tradition of the carver and of this carver's village is Ntumu. However, all three statues carved in that short period are figures that by Perrois's stated criteria (p. 3 ) are equiforme-the trunk having a ratio of .42 to the full height of each figure.' 8. If we look at the profile of Mabale's last carving (d) we see how arbitrary</page><page sequence="13">CHRONIQUE BIBLIOGRAPHIQUE 735 Yet Mabale's carvings changed over this short period of time toward greater truncal volume and reduced linearity-in spite of Perrois's numerical index remaining constant. His treatment of the face remained constant-he combined the characteristic idealized Fang heart shape face with the equally idealized and pronounced concavity. The legs changed from extension to a more traditional flexion. Above all his treatment of volume as well as the appearance of Perrois' critical proportions-what should be most stable-changed considerably. Next we consider two figures carved by Clemente Ndutumu of Malomo village (Acurenam District, Rio Muni, clan Efak). This carver produced reliquary figures in the 1940S but in the 1950S was commercialized by the Spanish. Though Ndutumu lives in the heart of the Okak country and his patrilineal antecedents have lived there for two generations, his antecedents of three generations ago lived just north of the Ntem River in Ntumu country. His figures, as seen in Fig. 5 (a. from our private collection, b. from the Lowie Museum) are not longi- forme in the Ntumu tradition, but on the borderline of tqui- and longiforme with a .46 index of proportionality. However, an emphasis on volume in the trunk gives the impression of compactness that is characteristic of the Nzaman-Betsi manner as identified by Perrois. Clemente Ndutumu practices a cutting style, a lining up of exterior points, that Ayang Ndong-an Okak elder who was not: himself a carver-stressed as underlying the best Fang carvings (Fernandez 1973: 219). In short, these two figures show that mixture of styles which Perrois points up (Perrois 1972:63) as characteristic of the borderland between northern Ntumu longiforme and southern Nzaman-Betsi brdviforme, although the carver does not live on the border but in the heart of Okak country. While Clemente Ndutumu's production shares Ntumu and Nzaman-Betsi characteristics, he carves in a manner distinct from either tradition for he fashions a full face and deviates from the ideal concave face. Otherwise he retains the serenity and balance cherished by Fang. the head trunk and leg divisions can be and how numbers in fact misrepresent the proportions of the major body parts as the eye perceives them. The trunk as seen from the front appears very long, while seen from the back it assumes the proportions of a brdviforme figure. It is the slant of the thigh, as well as the high rising core of a neck, that changes our impression of the linear style. We have observed that Perrois himself has deviated from the consistent application of his own criteria in his carvings nos. 5, 204, 64, and I89. In these he draws the trunk- leg division line somewhere below the highest point of the buttock, which, on p. 3I, he defines as delimiting. It is not surprising that this has occurred because the diagram of his theoretical scheme (p. 54, and reproduced here as Fig. 2) misleads us to take measurement of the trunk up from the frontal curvature of the thigh- spanning the distance from crouched thigh to bottom of chin. It appears that Perrois has allowed an idealized modal type, which he calls bafflingly 'the geometric mean of the theoretical sub-type' to be more controlling in his analysis than he realizes, and quite unjustified by reference to the metric proportions from which he meant to inductively establish his type. Has he inadvertently allowed a pre- conceived mental model to overdetermine his analysis? The problem is one of already knowing what Fang art 'should look like' and allowing such a mental model to determine analysis. That Perrois' preconceived mental model operated to limit his sample is evident in that The Sculpture of Africa (FAGG and ELISOFON I958) provided him with the source for the figure he numbers 103 in his own catalog. It is one of eleven bieri carvings well displayed in the Fagg work, four of them being full length figures. Perrois laments the lack of a frontal view for figure $IO3: 'Toutefois, le d6faut d'une vue de face limite le diagnostic car on ne se rend pas compte de la massivit6 du tronc.' Of the four full length figures displayed, three present both frontal and side view. Perrois chooses the single figure in the bieri section that is limited a side presentation. He gives no explanation for his selection.</page><page sequence="14">736 JAMES W. FERNANDEZ AND RENATE L. FERNANDEZ A similar combination of elements is characteristic of another Okak carver of Evinayong (central Rio Muni) whose name and identity we did not discover.9 One of his finer productions is seen in Fig. 6a. The same carver's work is repre- sented in Perrois (I972:84) as an example of Okak sub-style, brdviforme, see Fig. 6b. Yet by Perrois' criteria, Fig. 6a is equiforme. More interesting, however, is the combination of the relatively slight volume of the trunk, in the Ngumba manner of the North, countered by relatively heavy legs, arms, shoulders, and head. This carvers' figures are short, 30-35 cms., in contrast to those of the North which average just above 50 cms. Thus, despite the proportions and the slightness of the trunk there is a compactness that the northern figures do not possess. These four Okak figures from Evinayong and Akurenam are also shorter than the mean of Perrois' nine figures classified as Okak and whose height are registered in the catalog. The former's mean height is 36 cm., the latter's mean is 49 cm. while the average height for all Fang figures catalogued by Perrois is 49 cms. Perrois considers the Okak style to represent a reflux of influences from the Nzaman- Betsi style center, but our data argues that major influences have come from the Ngumba and Ntumu style areas as well. We now consider four Ntumu statues, one a very old one, two of middle age, and one carved in 1959, illustrated in Fig. 7a-d. All come from the portions of the Bitam and Oyem districts which lie strictly within the Ntumu area. The first figure comes from Assok Ngoum, 20 km. north of Oyem; it was given up and subsequently buried in the Ndende anti-witchcraft movement of I957. It is an old statue, probably carved in the last century. It is hyperlongiforme even while it emphasizes volume in the trunk. The carver was clan Nkojen, though the figure belonged to an ndebot of clan Bokwe whose antecedents' residence in the last hundred years was northeastern Gabon. Figures b and c come from just north of Bitam and were probably carved in the 1930S or I940S. They are tall statues, 66 an&amp; 67 cms. respectively, but their height is given them largely by the length of their extended legs which account for 40 percent of their height resulting in figures that by Perrois' criteria classify as equiforme. They stand in contrast to the old figure whose legs provide only 26 percent of the height of the figure. Also, they appear to lose volume in their height. But the final figure d, also a tall one of 6o cms., has substantial volume and a breviforme distribution. It was carved for us by Mvole Moze of central Oyem district, clan Nkojen. Remarkable is the volume of the head, surely one of the largest on record a full figure. This is in part explained by Mvole Moze's interest in carving masks to be danced and shown in the Mangan Flanco dances,"0 but it is also a reiteration of a primary if not exclusive interest in the head-as manifest in Fang reliquary figures of the nineteenth century-a point to which we will return. The diversity of these Ntumu figures makes generalization difficult as regards any constancy in the style of this sub-tribe. But we may have more luck finding constancy in the Mvai sub-style which Perrois regards as the purest of any Fang sub-styles (1972:63). It is recognized by the large head with a headdress of three arcs, eyes shaped like coffee beans, narrowing heart-shaped face with semi-pointed mandible and slightly downturned mouth, arms flexed directly under the chest, hands joined, a belly that swells up to the line of the navel and, lastly, careful tattooing that rises vertically up from the navel in a broad band. The Mvai are separated into two groups, probably the result of a slow Ntumu expansion across their territory. They are difficult to place and are generally assigned to the District of Minvoul in northeast Gabon, and to the western side of the Ntumu area in central 9. Perrois was told that this carver still lives in Esong village, Evinayong District, where he was said to be very old. We were told he was dead. io. One of his masks is in the collection of the Lowie Museum and is pictured in FERNANDEZ (1973: 2II).</page><page sequence="15">CHRONIQUE BIBLIOGRAPHIQUE 737 northern Rio Muni, as well as extending north into Cameroun to the confluence of the central Ntem and the Lo. However, the formerly dominant area of the Mvai is to the east of the Ntumu and, in fact, this is the only area to which Tessman assigns them (19I3: map opposite chapter i, p. i, Vol. I). Perrois recognizes the variety of exemples of this Mvai style and illustrates the range of variation with four figures, one of relatively recent manufacture (#194, p. 89). The Mvai style may be illustrated by the works of one of the great Fang masters of the mid-twentieth century, Ndutumu Singho (Fig. 8a-c). Singho, however, who died in I960, was neither Mvai in origin nor in adult identification. He lived most of his life in Akonayop, a village of the Essatuk clan just west of Ebebiyin in the heart of Rio Muni's Ntumu country. His clan held its origins to be Okak, and in the generation prior to Ndutumu Singho they were inhabitants of the area between Mangomo and Oyem. By Perrois' criteria, Singho's work is undeniably Mvai. In fact, piece #194 on p. 89, which Perrois used to illustrate the style, is very probably a Singho statue of the middle period when he was beginning to lengthen out the legs of his statues and before he had dropped the arms to the sides. In any case we are confronted by the anomaly of a Fang master who is carving in the so-called Mvai style but who was not himself nor ever had been Mvai. He was of Okak origin becoming Ntumu. This may be a case of super-organic (cultural) determinism, but we think rather that it argues for the lowest relationship between a so-called 'sub-tribal style' and a particular people. It is of interest to study the evolution of Singho's sculpture. It begins in the 1930S bryeviforme and notably 'Mvai' (Fig. 8a). There is apparently an eJquiforme period (Fig. 8b). Then the legs extend and become proportionately longer. In time his sons aid him in his work, the arms are dropped to the side and a greater realism is given to the entire conception (Fig. 8c). Early in his career Ndutumu Singho carved for reliquaries, but we have no extant piece of that work. He was early in his adult years commercialized by Spanish administrators and planters, and this no doubt put pressure on his style to adapt toward a more naturalistic ideal. As an additional instance of the contemporary difficulties involved in locating styles in space we offer seven of our figures carved from the late I930S to the early 1950s, and collected by us on the eastern borders of Rio Muni. Their provenience runs north to south. By Perrois' criteria this style line (running about I50 kilo- meters from the heart of Ntumu country into Okak country) should run from longiforme to equiforme, verging on bre'viforme. It actually wavers and runs, as we see in Fig. 9, longiforme, breviforme, hyperlongiforme, equiforme and longiforme. This seemingly random distribution may well be explained by village migrations and refluxes-as well as by the lengthening of legs in the later Singho Mvai style. Also these statues are all carved relatively close to the Ntumu heartland. But the point is that the empirical situation shows great latitude of style and does not yield ready confirmation of Perrois' thesis. The situation demonstrates to us the need for much greater precision of inquiry than that exercised by Perrois as regards the migration experience of the carvers' families. Furthermore, features of style other than the critical criteria catch our attention in this seven figure comparison and we will return to them later. Basing our interpretation on these few figures with clear attributions, and, for the most part, upon knowledge of the carver, we would like to propose a dynamic for the evolution of Fang reliquary figure styles that is different from Perrois. We cannot be any more certain of our hypothesis than Perrois can be certain of i i. Perrois gives a list of celebrated carvers but does not include Singho who is surely the most celebrated carver of the last half century in Rio Muni.

FERNANDEZ his-in which two style centers act upon a mobile people and result in various morphologies. Perrois and we ourselves were in the field very late, and we have before us too many vaguely attributed carvings to arrive easily at a sure explanation. But we would like to base our hypothesis on the facts of Fang migration, on the early observations of Tessmann (I9I3 [whose comments Perrois ignores even while drawing for his catalog on a number of figures represented in Tessmann's illustrations]), and on what the carvings we have reviewed here-together with those assembled in Perrois' work-seem to reveal. We also cannot pretend to assess this sculpture without taking into serious account the relationship of these figure carvings to the contents of the reliquaries- serving as guardians of the human skulls inside the reliquary container. We will avoid the temptation to suggest that art styles are static attributes of tribal and sub-tribal culture. For we have shown that styles have changed among the carving traditions credited to the several amorphous sub-tribes. We propose that there has been a dynamic diffusion process in Fang art more properly approached by something like an age-area explanation rather than from the perspective of tribal or sub-tribal style identifications. The problem in the study of Fang migration is that we at once tend to think of sub-tribes migrating as a whole, whereas Alexandre (I965:I4) and others have pointed out that it was done in a 'saute-mouton' fashion, with villages moving generally past one another down river and southward, and by no means staying within a bounded tribal or sub-tribal area. Just as Ndutumu Singho was born Okak but was becoming Ntumu, so in an earlier era there is sufficient evidence of Ntumu moving in among the Okak or Betsi and eventually acquiring the latter identity. Exogamy also produced interpenetration of sub-tribes. The search for wives often went well beyond the confines of a man's sub-tribe. Whatever sub-tribal cultural traits may have appeared would tend to dissolve under this interpenetra- tion, especially as the sons of the village were frequent and sometimes long-staying visitors in the homes of their maternal relatives. The turmoil of migration also made the boundaries of the sub-tribes especially permeable. The social system, as Alexandre points out (I965:521), was best described as well adapted to a state of semi-nomadism. We are not sure just when, in Fang migration, the sub-tribes first made their appearance. Fang myth and legend suggest, and this Perrois recognizes, that Fang began to split apart into sub-tribes after their entrance into the equatorial forest, as is symbolized in the Adzapmboga legend. The legend tells of Pahouin descent from northern grasslands and their escape from strange horsemen, elements that probably refer back to the Bar el-Ghazal of the Sudan. Tunneling through a giant tree at the edge of a river, they then dispersed in various groups through the area now known as southern Cameroun, Rio Muni, and Gabon. Alexandre posits that the Fang separated from the larger Pahouin (Pangwe, Pamue) communal core in the mid-eighteenth century (I790 at the very latest [I965:537]), but whether the four sub-groups were in existence already at this time is not known. He suggests that the Fang of the South were already divided into the Nzaman-Betsi of the Abanga, Okano and middle Ogooue basins toward the southeast, and the Mekeny and Okak of the Como, Utamboni, and Upper Abanga basins to the northwest. But the weight of Alexandre's argument would have it that while we can speak with some certainty of the historical migration experience of the Pahouin linguistic groups (Bulu, Fang, Beti, Ewondo) as distinct culturally from their neighbors, and while we can also distinguish between the experience of Bulu, Fang, and Beti 'tribes' separately, the experiences of the sub-tribes are far from clarified. Our own view of these migrations, and this is not the place to demonstrate them in detail, is the following: the Proto-Fang migration southward through southern Cameroun in the late sixteenth or seventeenth century already possessed</page><page sequence="17">CHRONIQUE BIBLIOGRAPHIQUE 739 sub-tribal distinctions: Mvai, Betsi, Mekeny Make, Okak, and Ntumu. Even then their boundaries were highly permeable. The Betsi and Mekeny were the avant-garde of this advance, the Okak and Mvai were a relatively minor group numerically, and the Ntumu were the largest numerical element, their population serving as the more stable rear guard. This Ntumu rear guard is represented in Fang legend and genealogy as the older brothers whose younger brothers, as a result of discontent under the authority of their elders, tended to split off and move on to form new villages. During migration the fissionary process meant that many Ntumu went in leap frog fashion to live among Nzaman-Betsi, and, in the vague way that sub-tribal identity was assumed, became such in time. They retained their clan names, and this is seen in the Efak, Essagi, Ndong, and Nkojen and other clans that are found among the Ntumu as well as the Betsi and Make. Furthermore, those clans which were mainly found in only one sub-tribe, for example the Essisis among the Okak, nevertheless recognized the related clans in other sub-tribes, Essanjol or Essosim, from which they were derived. And all of these three recognize that they are derived from great-clan Mobum. This recognition served to guarantee hospitality for a village or extended family which struck out to migrate into the area of another sub-tribe or into another part of the sparsely inhabited forest. This fissionary process built up the Okak and Mvai populations. It did so in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as the Fang were attracted by trade with the colonial powers on the seacoast. Subsequently after colonial stabilization there was a reflux of Fang northwards and a reverse tendency for Fang, Okak and Mvai to become Ntumu.1' The reflux may also account for the splitting of the Mvai into two parts, as well as the shunting aside of the Okak into the western margins of Fang country. It was in the twentieth century that the direction of movement ceased to be pronounced. Yet the imperatives of slash and burn farming and the fallowing that it entails produced movement. Eddies and northward movement continued to take place, and some Fang repenetrated areas in which one's paternal ante- cedents may have lived. This would explain the Ntumu-ization of an Okak such as Ndutumu Singho. On the one hand with the trend toward sedentarization, encouraged by colonial authorities, the eddies became more minute and encouraged a more fixed sub-tribalism. On the other hand the new communications network provided improved opportunity for movement, marriage, for example, on a large scale. These contrary tendencies moved toward the establishment of sub-tribal identities-abetted by European reification of the sub-tribe on the one hand while making sub-cultural separation more difficult by reason of interpenetration and intercommunication on the other. We see then that the sub-tribal designations have had little cultural significance. They may be considered a device of nomenclature that was recurrently obscured by migration and assimilation. Fang frequently enough recognized 'My fathers have been Ntumu, my children, born here, will be Mvai.' But that acceptance of a new sub-tribal designation did not imply the acceptance of a significantly new culture much less of a particular art style. What, then, are the implications of this migration and interpenetration for the evolution of Fang reliquary figure styles? Here we must take Tessmann's observations as primary. His view, and he illustrates it clearly (I913, II:117-I21), is that the carved head alone which was stuck down into the bark reliquary was the original figure, and that this head gradually evolved into a bust, then a half 12. The Spanish ethnographers PANYELLA and SABATER have written pene- tratingly on this Ntumu-ization' of the Okak (I955). See also ALCOBA and PANYELLA (195I).</page><page sequence="18">740 JAMES W. FERNANDEZ AND RENATE L. FERNANDEZ figure of trunk and head (1913, I:II7), and eventually into the variety of full body carvings which he also illustrates. (Some of these Perrois had included in his catalog.)'3 For a people in rapid migration who are transporting their ancestor cult in the form of a reliquary, the less encumbrance that is involved in transporting an ancestor figure the more convenient it is; and we note that the reliquary itself was almost certainly an adaptation to migration. As we have argued elsewhere (I956:55), the carving of a head together with the reliquary represents a human figure; the bark reliquary represents the trunk of the figure in which are contained the stomach and the lungs, the vital organs. The trunk of the human body is the repository of power to Fang, and so the reliquary barrel was the repository of power, over which the reliquary head (nlo bian, medicine head, the old name for the reliquary figure) posed in watchful vigilance. In any case we posit that among proto-Fang, in all their subdivisions, the ancestor figure was the composite of the carved reliquary barrel together with its head. This use of the only mounted head persisted, even though it undervent stylistic enlargement, to a very late date only in the most southern fringe or frontier area of the Betsi, notably along the Ogoowe River (Grebert 1948:I43) and along the Okano. Its persistence there is accountable to the age-area principle of conser- vatism on the peripheries. Also it was these fringe or frontier areas that remained as the fer de lance, agitated and embattled, preoccupied with the struggle for terri- tory while the Ntumu-at least those Ntumu who did not leave and integrate into other sub-tribes-were much more stable and freer for cultural elaboration since at least the mid-nineteenth century." We argue that this greater stability gave rise, together with stimulus diffusion from the European presence on the coast and in the central Cameroun (Fernandez I966:55), to dynamic style changes from head to full figure. These changes occurred later in fringe areas. We regard the Ntumu heartland-roughly the northeast corner of RZio Muni, from Mangomo to Ebibiyin, and the northwest corner of Gabon (formerly Kamerun) -as being the center of creativity and creative diversity for Fang reliquary art. This is certainly true in the earlier period of Fang migration where the greater stability of Ntumu allowed for style changes-an elaboration and increase in dimension that would have been awkward for those in full migration. These changes in the center in age-area fashion spread to the peripheries. In the later reflux period peripheral styles fed back into the Ntumu heartland and it is that mix and branching, as in the case of the Mvai, which confuse our judgment, as, for example, in Fig. 9 above or in the Mvai stylization of the Okak-Ntumu master carver Ndutumu Singho. Perrois himself recognizes what a range of style varieties are found in the Rio Muni, Gabon, and Cameroun borderland (1972:i06-107). This, of course, is not all that is to be said about the evolution of the Fang style. It helps to account for the persistence of carved heads on the peripheries of Fang country, even while the development of full carved figures proceeded in the Ntumu heartland. It does not account for the two main varieties of full i3. Perrois includes two of these in his catalog: t40 (p. 320) from the Neuchatel Museum, the other #ii8 (P. 375), taken from Tessmann. He does not include a full photograph of the barrel trunk and fails to confront the integral relationship of reliquary barrel to carved head. 14. The single exception to this Ntumu stability are the Oban raids of the I850s which forced many of their villages hundreds of kilometers south. DEs- CHAMPS (I962: 92-93) incidentally locates the Ntumu in their present locale at the end of the eighteenth century. This was just when the Betsi began to appear at the escarpment making their presence known to coastal peoples. They were in a state of turmoil for fully a century thereafter. They were, in their struggle to replace the autochthonous people, no doubt strengthened by migrations from the Ntumu area.</page><page sequence="19">CHRONIQUE BIBLIOGRAPHIQUE 74I figure carvings; the tendency toward long linear figures of the northern Ngumba and Ntumu on the one hand, and the tendency toward shorter figures of concentrat- ed volume of the Mvai, Betsi and Okak on the other. It seems to us that we have in these two varieties of full length figures the divergent consequences of a choice made at the moment of elaborating the archaic head on its long stick into a full figure. Stylistically one could hold the linearity of the shaft and the relatively small head constant by adding minimal shoulders and legs to that linearity. In other words one could make a figure out of a stick; a stylistic direction expressed most clearly in the Ngumba figure (Fig. io).21 The other stylistic option, it seems to us, is to take the bark barrel and head as a whole. In this way the carving holds onto the volume of the reliquary itself, even while maintaining an emphasis on the head which is after all the chief symbol of the contents, the skulls. It seems to us that, perhaps for reasons of migration, the more southerly Fang maintained this volume as central to their vision of the reliquary figure. Thus we get the Gqui- and breviforme figures of the Mvai, Okak and Betsi. And we also get the occasional full figure carving in which a box-like depression is carved into the trunk itself, in which fragments of bone have been kept (Fig. i i).16 We maintain that the original stimulus for the creation of the full figures arose in Ntumu country. Thus, although Perrois calls the Nzaman-Betsi figures 'classic' Fang sculpture (p. 63), we believe this use of the term to be an accident of collection and European preference. Classic Fang sculpture in chronological terms would be Ntumu and possibly Mvai. While Betsi figures under Ntumu stimulus were continuing the 'classic' style, the Ntumu figures explored further and further along their aesthetic line of choice until, due to latter day European influence no doubt, the legs lengthened out to such a non-classic' proportion as exhibited in Fig. 7c. Traditional art theory maintains that the highest expression of an art is found not in the place of origin but closer to the periphery of that art's extension. This fits well with our idea of Ntumu country (a shifting locus to be sure) as being the center of origination, the locus of diversification, and it also concurs with Perrois' acceptance of the 'classic nature' of the Betsi figures-for the Betsi are on the peripheries. We offer then this hypothesis: that the Ntumu country was the heartland of creativity in Fang sculpture, that it is the area of origin of the major evolution in styles: from head, to half, to full figure. This hypothesis contrasts with Perrois' more elaborate theory of two interacting style centers and with their intermediate gradations. We believe our hypothesis to be both more adequate and more parsimonious. It takes into consideration the facts and constraints of migration, the importance of the entire reliquary in stylistic development, and the dynamic of stylistic choice in moving from head to full figure. We and Perrois together both face the uncertainties of the original attributions, the vagaries of sub-tribal migration, the late nineteenth and twentieth-century reflux, which brought peripheral styles back into the heartland. We also face the fact, which he does not, of the permeability of sub-tribal boundaries. We acknowledge the recurrent possibility that a village or a part of a village might move many tens or even 15. It is noteworthy, in respect to this interest in the stick, that the carrying of walking sticks or swagger sticks topped with head or full figures has long been of strong interest to Fang carvers. The collection of these sticks deserve study. i6. The two divergent stylistic paths were evident as well, if the reader will permit an anecdote, in child's play. We observed two girls visiting from distant parts of Fang country in a common relative's village in Oyem district, Sougoudzap- ville, 1959. They were powdering their respective doll babies; the girl from the north applied talc to a cvlindrical trunk of banana, the girl from the south ap- plied talc to an ovoid shaped gourd.

FERNANDEZ hundreds of kilometers to join clansmen or linked clans among other sub-tribes and to carry with them figures and heads carved in quite a different sub-tribal area. There is, of course, a similarity in our positions. We had once thought the problem of style so obscure as not to repay investigation. Perrois' useful labors have stimulated us to see that it is, though not in the way he has formulated it. We must leave to future students the resolution of these differences, whether by dendrochronology (never very satisfactorily practiced in the tropical or sub- tropical environment), by archaeology, by more concentrated attention to genea- logical history, or yet by some other method to emerge. We would like to turn to a matter of as great or even more importance to us: the qualities inherent in these statues. The Qualities of Fang Statuary: Little People of the Reliquary Fundamentally interesting to the student of African art in general, and of Fang reliquary art in particular, are questions which largely surpass morpho- logical analysis-of the qualities that inhere in the figures themselves and their meaning to the Fang. These statues tell us something about Fang culture, about the relationship of Fang to their supernaturals. But we do not learn these things without a long period of participant observation among Fang, such as Gunther Tessmann's, which gives authority to the few things Tessmann says about these figures. The main purpose of the reliquary figures, he says, was to warn away the uninitiated from the barrels of skulls (I913,11: II7). In contrast to the skulls the carvings were not particularly meaningful in themselves. Fang easily parted with them for a consideration. Tessmann is careful not to imply that the figures were frightening in themselves but were only signs that something incomprdhen- sible and untouchable was to be found within. In fact, almost all the figures that have been collected have a quality of alert repose, or hieratic meditation if one prefers, rather than aggressivity. Only a few figures may be said to appear aggressive in the sense that they are grimacing or adopting a threatening gesture." Among these only one holds a pointed object, a medicine horn, as in Fig. I2 taken from Perrois' catalog $203 (1972:177). There may be an anomaly here for those who have cherished the Fang reputa- tion for aggressive and warlike character, and who have emphasized Fang appro- priation by force of half the territory of Gabon. Yet, however constant the frontier warfare and the internecine strife may have been among Fang, and whatever their reputation, they were not a warlike people in the concentrated and aggran- dizing way that the nineteenth-century Zulu, for example, were warlike. They did not wage war but rather generated incessant raids, usually on a village by village basis. We come closer to understanding the qualities of the Fang ancestor figure when we consider those qualities most valued in mature men which are 'composedness' (nlem mvore), 'even-handed tranquility' (mvwaa), and the capacity to hold opposites in balance.18 We have shown elsewhere how it is balance in proportion rather in movement which is valued by Fang carvers (Fernandez I 7. Among the figures we collected there are neither frightening faces nor gestures. In the Perrois catalog few figures if any can be called aggressive. The following list of possible aggressive figures show bared teeth or a raised arm: #203 (p. 177), Xi66 (p. I99), ,I42 (P. 305), :6 (P. 368), #I23 (P. 287). i8. This is a quality which inspires widespread acclamation in African culture and which frequently enough is metaphorically assessed as 'coolness'. R. F. Thomp- son has brought together materials from many African cultures showing how widespread that metaphor is (THOMPSON 1973: 197). In our experience the metaphor of coolness does not have that meaning among Fang. More character- istic is the metaphor of balance (bipwe).</page><page sequence="21">CHRONIQUE BIBLIOGRAPHIQUE 743 I966:56). There is thus a quality in these figures which is a quality of maturity and wisdom itself. And surely the ancestors must be the ultimate embodiment of maturity and wisdom. What, in one viewing, is the severe maintainance of balance between opposing elements in another viewing, however, emerges as a quality of tension. If this tension is not immediately apparent to us-for their ancestral awareness, their serenity strike us first-we become aware of it and see it emerge as we observe Fang interacting with these figures. We had the opportunity to see the figures being cleaned with palm oil, being prepared to receive requests from the living. There, in the pre-ceremonial occasion, they were treated as Fang children. They were addressed rather peremptorily-in actuality it was as much the hidden craniums that were being addressed-and better performance in the carrying out of their responsibilities, ancestral responsibilities, was demanded of them. Thus their mature quality, their awesomeness in certain situations, yielded to an almost infantile quality in others. We have pointed out elsewhere how their big heads, their wide staring disc eyes, their flexed small legs have an infantile association for Fang of our acquaintance. It is not a mere figure of speech that they are, with great frequency, called medicine children (mwan biang). In fact the ambig- uous combination of infantile and mature qualities in these figures-the condition of being at once infant and ancestor, child and parent-is not simply an observation based on an anecdote or unique to Fang. The Fang ancestor figures are 'little people' who mediate between the material and the spiritual world, and 'little people'-pygmees, dwarfs, trolls-who combine in themselves the qualities of infancy and old age (a dwarf, for example, combines a child's body and an adult's head) are widespread mediators between this world and the other in Africa and elsewhere. MacGaffey (I969) has demonstrated this convincingly for the Congo and Wescott for Nigeria (I962). It is doubtful that any amount of morpho- logical analysis will yield insight into these liminal qualities in tension. We also see that despite the august note of warning they were intended to convey these figures could also be taken out and-as Tessmann both illustrates (1913,JI: I21-23) and describes-danced in a frolicsome and mocking manner like puppets above a raffia barrier before the public. What are then awesome objects of warning in ritual or ceremonial contexts can also emerge as playthings. Obviously the Fang reliquary figures embody a variety of contrasting qualities, some potential and some actual, in their presentation. Little wonder Fang emphasize balance in the presentation of their proportions. We learn the associations of art and artifacts from long experience in a culture. In this respect, in the obtaining of the cultural context, Perrois' presentation is least helpful. He hias not spent enough time among the Fang nor studied their culture with enough intensity. No blame attaches to him, for his purposes were primarily morphological." Moreover, none of us can presume to have spent enough time in Fang culture. In this respect we wait to hear from Fang themselves. But it is a late hour for even Fang to speak with authority of the ancestor cult. We would like to correct for the record some of Perrois' observations upon the cultural context of the figures and upon the ancestor cult, bieri, in which they appeared. For example, he gives us a long tale (1972:133-34) which was sung to him and which purports to show that human sacrifice was necessary to obtain and confirm a reLiquary and one's membership in bieri. But the story he gives us is from the mvet cycle of troubador tales-accounts of superhuman precursors of men (not ancestors) whose mighty, often monstrous deeds and misdeeds are I9. We should perhaps be critical also of his method essentially that of presenting photos and asking for identification. Care might have been exercised in the presentation of sequences of that inquiry and could have been provided for the reader's inspection. The limited choices of such a mode of inquiry is perhaps too coercive of informant's responses. I2*</page><page sequence="22">744 JAMES W. FERNANDEZ AND RENATE L. FERNANDEZ not confused by Fang with the affairs of men. It is true that Fang recognized evil men (niem witches, and envalen evil old people) who tried to obtain power by the sacrifice of others' lives. But it is a libel upon the ancestor cult, which was fundamentally benevolent and which emphasized mutuality, 20 to suggest that its basis was human sacrifice. That suggestion, incidentally, appears very early in the colonial literature. In fact one was initiated into the bieri cult-Other than because one had accidentally seen the skulls-simply as a consequence of obtaining a certain status in the society which was dependent upon having spouse and offspring. The members of the ancestor cult (ngo malan) were typically the mature heads of family (nyamoro). The tale is, in short, an old deprecatory canard, though we are sure Perrois did not intend it in this way. Nevertheless, the consequences of assigning such a tale to the ancestor cult is to misread the associations of the ancestor figures in Fang thinking. It is our view, based on our research, that the main quality inherent in most of these statues is that of protective benevolence (akam or mvam). If we mistake a look of solemnity as a hostile or peremptory demand for sacrifice then we are indeed misunderstanding a central value of the ancestor cult embodied in these figulres. The figures also have an air of secret knowledge appropriate to the ancestors. Indeed Fang folk etymology derives their general term for carved figure, eyema, from the root, yem, to know.' Perrois' transcription and translation of the language is also uncertain-though the shortcoming is understandable in a short and itinerant inquiry. As a minor example he takes the term for basin (cuvette [fr.], etokh) as meaning a particular mixture of medicinal leaves. Correctly it is the receptacle for the leaves and is a term also used metonymically for a purification rite. Again he takes the formu- laic chant of the purification rite (ava mete'n) as being the purification chant of the ancestor cult. But the chant is of much broader use than that-in fact he transcribed the chant of a purification ritual which in our experience need only be obliquely associated with the ancestor cult. Purification was a stage in the bieri rituals (which generally ran for two to three days, not the five or six days which Perrois states), and this chant was there employed for purification but also served elsewhere for purification purposes of non-members. It was not the first stage of ancestor cult initiation, as Perrois states, but a stage subsequent to the ingestion of the psycho-active leaves alan (Alchornea floribundia). Perrois' observations on the Fang aesthetic and Fang carving techniques are useful as far as they go. He explores the two major terms in the Fang lexicon of aesthetic appreciation, mba and mve. Mba is that good which applies to good appearance in things; mve is that good which applies to good action, conduct or behavior. A beautiful woman is mbung or mbamba mininga; a good woman is mininga a ne mve. This distinction works generally but we have seen a homely but kind woman referred to as mbamba mininga, so there is ambiguity in these 20. The Mvet story moreover concerns the 'fetish for the obtaining of riches' okuma which Perrois takes to be the bieri of the clan. But in fact this 'fetish' enmpowered by human bones and possibly by sacrifice has very little or nothing to do with the ancestor cult. Moreover, the 'fetish' is probably of recent post- European contact data (bieri is much older). Its purpose is to obtain riches for an individual or a family by anti-social means. Bieri traditionally was not anti- social though it is true that as the cult collapsed under colonial pressures, individual craniums and pieces of ancestral bone were taken up for individual selfish purposes in the manner of the okuma fetish. Perrois is stretching for an interpretation of this story-when one of the characters says, 'I am too poor' Perrois interprets this as 'religious poverty'. But it means just what it says. A family feeling itself poor is trying to become rich through preparation of a fetish. That was not the purpose of the ancestor cult. 2I. It is more likely that the root involved in the term for statue (eyeme) is yem (high tone): 'to be stout, solid, unflinching'.</page><page sequence="23">CHRONIQUE BIBLIOGRAPHIQUE 745 concepts. And, in fact, both terms can be applied to reliquary figures. They can be well carved (mba) and over the years effective (mve) together with the craniums, in guaranteeing the well-being of the village. Perrois points out (I972:I4) that the root ba, to cut or carve out, 'lies behind the term for aesthetically pleasing and that a carving is known as the mba beyima'. So the general term for pleasing to the eye would fundamentally have something to do with the carving or cutting out process-what pleases is what is well fashioned. In our experience it is true that the Fang have a high appreciation for craftsmanship and rather little response to such western notions of beauty as sunsets, which are not in their view 'fashioned'. Conclusion Perrois points up the anthropomorphism of Fang carvings. It is a 'man- centered art'. Indeed, it is remarkably so when compared with ancestor figures of neighbors, such as the Bakota, whose carvings are much more geometric and abstract. But antilope masks were made in the soo cult of the Ntumu." Also in the ngi and nzok cults animal representations were sculpted in the earth (Tess- mann 1913, II:74). Fang art is not, as Perrois implies, exclusively man-centered. That their reliquary art is man-centered is perhaps not so remarkable when we reflect on what is being represented. Furthermore the Bakota abstractions are the exception in African art of this genre. One cannot but appreciate Perrois' efforts in bringing together under one cover so many examples of one of the great African art styles. Still, he gives us but a small sample of the universe of that art. His morphological analysis is precise in some respects and shows slippage in others. It does not necessarily lead to the conclusions which he gives us regarding the evolution of styles and sub-styles. Because attributions for most reliquary figures are vague or were never existent, and because of the volatile inter-tribal migratory tendencies of Fang, another interpretation of the style dynamics is at least as plausible and more parsimonious, and that is the one given here. The treatment of the cultural context and the aesthetic appreciation of Fang figures needs to be at once much more precise and penetrating than Perrois has given here. We have tried to indicate directions in which that precision and penetration might move. We await a definitive study of Fang reliquary art. And we thank Perrois for his efforts in moving us in that direction. BIBLIOGRAPHY ALCOBt, Santiago and PANYELLA, A.
