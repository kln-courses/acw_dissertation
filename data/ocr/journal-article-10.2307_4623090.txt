Oxford, New York: Berghahn Books, 2006. $70.00 (cloth) Along with Ralph Bulmer, Brent Berlin, and Eugene Hunn, Roy Ellen is one of the pioneers in the development of ethnobiology. Although a crucial sub-discipline, standing at the interface between the biological and social sciences, ethnobiology is very much of a marginal interest to most cultural anthropologists. It is given no mention at all (for example) in Ingold's compendium of anthropology, or in Michael Herzfeld's text on 'Anthropology', which quite misleadingly sets up a false dichotomy between our critical engagement of the world and our explanations of it. Ethnobiologists were never besotted with either textualism or postmodernism, and always distanced Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 13, 1023-1063 @ Royal Anthropological Institute 2007</page><page sequence="2">1038 BOOK REVIEWS themselves from crude positivism, a concept nowadays employed by cultural anthropologists as a term of abuse, even though they themselves tend to embrace the radical empiricism and anti-realism of the positivists! This present text is an important and very worthwhile collection of Roy Ellen's essays and reflections on ethnobiology, specifically focusing on ethnobiological classifications and on classifying behaviour. Written over the past thirty years or so, they represent a seminal and enduring contribution to anthropological knowledge. It is, however, a pity that the collection leaves out Ellen's essays on Nuaulu hunting strategies and on modes of subsistence, as well as his critique of romantic ecology 'What Black Elk left unsaid', which is a very useful teaching text. Some ten essays comprise the collection, all written in a readable, engaging style, and embracing the virtues that Ellen generously attributes to the late Ralph Bulmer, namely a scrupulous attention to ethnographic detail (with Ellen this specifically relates to the Nuaulu, swidden-cultivators living in the rainforests of South Central Seram); a respect for the knowledge of individual informants; an insistence that classifying behaviour, and cultural practices generally, must be embedded in their wider social and ecological contexts; and, finally, a respectful but critical attitude towards universalist-evolutionary paradigms. This is an approach that is quite different from the dismissive attitude of many cultural anthropologists and postmodernists. Ellen certainly does not feel it necessary to disparage and denigrate the scientific endeavours of biologists, psychologists, and social scientists more generally. In fact, as he writes in the introduction - written especially for the collection - what he has always attempted to do is to build 'bridges' between the social constructionists (like Mary Douglas) and those who emphasize a cognitivist and universalist approach to ethnobiological classifications (like Brent Berlin). In bridging this divide, Ellen seeks to develop a more embedded and processual approach to the understanding of classifying behaviour. His central focus is, then, on the relationship between cognition and culture, bringing together cognitive studies, which tend to emphasize the universal aspects of cognitive processes and cultural anthropology with its focus on cultural beliefs, or what Ellen, following Durkheim, calls 'collective representations'. Although the collection has a specific focus, on the relationship between culture and cognition, the essays nevertheless are fairly wide-ranging and cover many important topics and issues. Four of these are worth noting, as they may be of interest to cultural anthropologists. First, there is an interesting discussion, for example, of Nuaulu zoological classifications, particularly relating to the cuscus, a marsupial mammal, and the cassowary, both of which are of crucial importance to these swidden-cultivators. Against the emphasis on formal taxonomies, Ellen demonstrates that the Nuaulu mode of classification is inherently variable, flexible, and dynamic, often overlapping, and thus can be understood only if placed within a situational context - whether cultural, social, technical, or ecological. Classifying behaviour is thus a dynamic process and inherently contextual, essentially an expression of human-environment interactions. This leads Ellen to question the rigid separation of general-purpose classifications, expressed in formal taxonomies, and special-purpose classifications, which relate either to pragmatic usage (as medicine or food, for example) or to the symbolic significance of animal (or plant) categories. But Ellen nevertheless emphasizes the crucial importance of the categories that relate to the biotic domain - expressing as they do the inherent discontinuities of the natural world - for they form the basis or 'benchmark' for wider semiotic schemas and cultural paradigms. Second, drawing on the distinction between the processes of analysis (separation, difference, part-of) and synthesis (aggregation, unity, kind-of) - as interdependent cognitive processes - Ellen gives an interesting account of human body parts (anatomical classifications) and how such classifications relate to cultural ideas and artefacts, particularly to social and symbolic classifications. Third, in a seminal discussion of the concept of 'fetishism' - expressed in early anthropological studies of religion, in Marxist theory, and in psychological and psychoanalytic studies - Ellen attempts to show that such cultural paradigms are not so much pathological, dysfunctional, and deviant, nor do they express some 'primitive' mode of thought, but rather they can be understood by relating them to universal, underlying cognitive processes. These specifically include: the general propensity of humans to express complex ideas and relationships as 'things', to thus reify ideas through a process of concretization; the general tendency of humans to animate things, and thus Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 13, 1023-1063 @ Royal Anthropological Institute 2007</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 1039 to apprehend and represent the world in anthropomorphic terms; and, finally, the general human tendency to conflate, especially in a ritual context, the signifier (an artefact or organic being) with the signified (some spiritual agent). Thus Ellen explores the interplay between the three cultural traditions which have utilized the concept of 'fetishism' and these three universal cognitive mechanisms, emphasizing that although individual perception and cognition and cultural schemas and 'representations' are clearly distinct, and ought not to be conflated, their relationship is always one of 'mutual embeddedness' (p. 186). Finally, the importance of a 'contextual' approach is also reflected in Ellen's essay on the 'cognitive geometry of nature'. Reacting against the claim of the cultural idealists and postmodernists that nature is simply a 'social construct' and acknowledging that the concept of 'nature' is by no means universal, Ellen emphasizes that our conceptions of the natural world vary historically and ethnographically. Thus there are multiple ways in which nature may be interpreted and used in specific cultural settings. But Ellen suggests that underlying our conceptions of nature there are three basic cognitive dispositions which are widely recognized. These relate to the idea that nature is an inventory or collection of different kinds of 'things' or 'natural kinds', which are expressed as basic categories - the concept of 'nature' is not in itself a basic category; the notion of nature as a topological space that is distinct, and separate from human concerns; and, finally, nature conceived as an inner essence or force. But Ellen, like Maurice Bloch and Tim Ingold, downplays the linguistic model of culture and affirms that language only mediates - and then only rather inadequately - between these three underlying cognitive dispositions and the diverse cultural conceptions of nature. And he emphasizes the contextual, variable, and contingent ways in which these various cultural schemas and paradigms are utilized. He thus completely repudiates the exoticism of much cultural anthropology which sets up a false dichotomy between so-called 'Western' thought (equated with Cartesian metaphysics) and the thought of forest peoples living in some remote part of the world. The book is sub-titled 'essays in the anthropology of classifying behaviour', and for Ellen the process of classifying inherently connects culture, psychology, and the perceptual discontinuities of the concrete world. Our propensity to classify - the categorical impulse - thus involves the possession of innate cognitive skills, but it also concerns our ability, as Ellen cogently puts it, 'to organize our perceptions through culture (aided by language) based on models drawn from somatic experience, and from social and perceptual experience of the material world' (p. 29). Thus, although eschewing philosophical issues, Ellen stands firmly in the tradition of historical or emergent materialism. In fact, he quotes Engels to suggest that although our categories may be socially constructed, they still refer to a real world. The early chapters of the book, along with Ellen's important introduction to the recent volume Ethnobiology and the science of humankind (]RAI Special Issue, 2006), give a clear and refreshing overview of the sub-discipline, as well as affirming ethnobiology's crucial role in the continuing development of anthropology as a multi-discipline. An anthropology interpreted not as a form of semiotics or as a purely literary enterprise, but as the historical science of humankind. BRIAN MORRIS Goldsmiths College</page></plain_text>
