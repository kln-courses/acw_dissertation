<plain_text><page sequence="1">DEMETER AND POSEIDON: FUSION AND DISTANCE IN TO THE LIGHTHOUSE ANNE GOLOMB HOFFMAN To the Lighthouse considers the problem of creating meaningful form, living without drowning in the chaos of nature. Largely through Lily, who struggles with the pull to extremes through the novel, one can define a series of polar opposites that structure the text. At its most abstract, the tension is between form and chaos, but it permeates all levels of the novel and can be articulated in terms of separation and fusion, singleness and marriage, the life of the artist and that of the family, impersonality and personal involvement, and, on a mythic level to which I shall devote my attention, Poseidon and Demeter. Mr. Carmichael and Mrs. Ramsay are identified with these pagan deities in ways which elaborate the system of the text and enable us to understand more fully the dilemma of its artist-protagonist. I shall comment on the development of the final form of the novel out of the manuscript, for the revisions that Woolf made suggest her growing awareness of this central structure and how it might best be articulated.1 Lily is the artist in the process of becoming, a task which involves mediating her relationship to the waves, the familiar attempt to find some balance between immersion and dry sterility. Mr. Carmichael, craggy sea god, points the way to an answer; it is appropriate that he carry his French novel as if it were a trident, for, as tamer of the waves, he embodies the solution that art offers?the control and mediation of distance that are neces? sary to the creation of enduring form. Mrs. Ramsay as Demeter, goddess of the bounty of nature, the mar? riage bond, motherhood, functions by contrast as the principle of merger; she demonstrates the loss of independent selfhood that engagement in life exacts, to a greater or lesser extent. Lily encounters the necessity of engage? ment through her very responsiveness to Mrs. Ramsay. It is Mrs. Ramsay who is capable of a loss of self?of becoming "the thing she looked at"?that goes beyond that of any other character in the novel.2 At such moments, [182]</page><page sequence="2">TO THE LIGHTHOUSE / 183 Mrs. Ramsay becomes virtually a principle of fusion, of merger, which is appropriate for the goddess of marriage, the obedient bride of the underworld. (The confusion or fusion of mother and daughter, Demeter and Persephone, is a subject I shall explore later in this essay.) Neither Poseidon nor Demeter, Mr. Carmichael nor Mrs. Ramsay, offers a solution or an alternative that is complete in and of itself and indeed, there is a curious antagonism between them. Nevertheless, we do glimpse an under? lying bond, a kind of mutual acknowledgment, at the dinner party. The dinner party is the pagan goddess's feast, celebrating the rite of marriage in the union of the young lovers. Yet it is also the occasion that yields the fruits of Western civilization in the literary discourse of the guests; as such, it earns Mrs. Ramsay Mr. Carmichaers courtly bow, a tribute which she graciously acknowledges. Mrs. Ramsay and Mr. Carmichael may join in their mutual pleasure at the bowl of fruit?"Neptune's banquet" (p. 97)?that Rose has arranged, but each possesses a distinct way of looking at it; each is known for a different mode of response, which we might characterize in Mr. Carmichael as the capacity for separateness and detachment as opposed to the capacity for merger in Mrs. Ramsay. During the dinner party, the rapprochement between Poseidon and Demeter suggests that the two provide for an antitheti? cal tension. Between them, the artist must make her way.3 The exquisite harmony of the dinner party is followed by the reading scene which brings Part I of the novel to its culmination. Here, in ways I shall explore, Woolf unites not only two characters, husband and wife, but even more importantly exemplifies two modes of reading, of engagement with language and experience, that are central to her imaginative life. "On Being 111," an essay contemporaneous with the novel, elaborates further these modes of response by differentiating between the reader's response to fiction and to poetry. Woolf appears to view the reading process as the occasion for empathie merger on the reader's part and so for a less rigidly sustained sense of self: thus, the capacity for loss of self that characterizes Mrs. Ramsay can be understood to form part of the experience of reading and indeed to be an important component of creativity. Beyond the represen? tation of readers reading that Woolf provides in the novel, perhaps she means for the reader of the novel to gain some perception of him- or herself in the act of reading and to consider the nature of the experience even as he or she engages in it. * * * Both Lily and Mr. Ramsay think of the fate of their work: Lily repeats her conviction that her painting is destined to be hung in attics and Mr. Ramsay worries who will read him, who reads Ruskin, how long Shakespeare's</page><page sequence="3">184 / HOFFMAN light will last. Ultimately, as Mr. Ramsay realizes, his little light will be absorbed into the larger light, but the light will endure. And so too for Lily, the fate of her painting matters less than the fact that she has painted it?has engaged in the fearsome process, the battle with a chaos of feeling?that painting demands.4 The question of the endurance of the individual emerges as secondary to the importance of the ongoing activity of making form, seeking meaning. If we look to the novel for articulation of this theme of light against darkness, we come to Mr. Carmichael who presides, like a benevolent deity, over the proceedings. We see him, in Part I, "sunk ... in a grey-green somnolence which embraced them all, without need of words, in a vast and benevolent lethargy of well-wishing'' (p. 10). It is just the aspect of benevo? lence that is lacking from the manuscript of the novel which merely makes note of his lethargy; in the transition from manuscript to text, Woolf seems, characteristically, to have refined and so rendered more precise her concept of the character's function. This "grey-green somnolence" identifies Mr. Carmichael with the sea, a suggestion that is borne out when we see him at the end, rising up like some craggy sea monster, French novel or trident in his hand. He is indeed Poseidon, tamer of the waves, and as such the appro? priate figure to preside over a novel which tackles the waters. As modulator of the waters, Mr. Carmichael constitutes the genius of art. The mythical reference signals a level beyond the existence in time of a character in a novel. Through myth as eternal return, Woolf provides the very gentle suggestion that Mr. Carmichael belongs to a more enduring frame of reference than the merely temporal. His benediction at the outset and his unspoken message to Lily at the end?"nothing stays; all changes; but not words, not paint" (p. 179)?place him so as to draw together the text for the reader and for Lily. Interestingly, it is Lily who "hears" his unspoken message; that is, the Poseidon identification is predominantly hers; within the plot, it is for her that Mr. Carmichael functions as the spirit of art. Beyond Lily's perspective and on a level to which only author and reader have access, Mr. Carmichael constitutes something of a textual marker. Seemingly ageless and enduring, his presence sanctifies the very process of literature. Furthermore, it is Mr. Carmichael who presides over the middle section of the novel through his ongoing engagement in civilized activity: by the light of a single candle he sits up late reading Virgil. His solitary vigil at the start of Part II and his presence again at the end of the section are not to be found in the original manuscript of the novel; one might construe the insertion of his presence as a frame for the middle section. It is, of course, fitting that Augustus read Virgil: the names are rendered equivalent by the code of literary allusion that runs through the text. Woolf uses Mr. Carmichael to articulate the theme of the survival of culture amid the ravages of time and war.</page><page sequence="4">TO THE LIGHTHOUSE / 185 In the manuscript, Mr. Carmichael is particularized to a greater extent and is presented more in terms of his work with words: he is seen describing to Andrew the manner in which he waits for words to come to him and sets them down with an assurance that they will endure. This glimpse of the poet at work is excised from the final version of the novel, along with other particulars in the description of Mr. Carmichael, in such a way as to render him "impersonal" (Lily's word for his poetry) and to suggest more his mythic outlines than his individuality. One thinks here of Woolf s designa? tion of a kind of artistic incandescence to be found in the works of Shakes? peare or Jane Austen, who have consumed their own impediments so as to achieve the luminous impersonality of great art.5 Within the novel, Mr. Carmichael keeps the vigil of art, points to its permanence beyond the span of any particular individual or work. He is the type of the artist and so offers no individual model for the making of poetry beyond the hints of identifica? tion with Poseidon; thus he serves simply to suggest the necessity for com? ing into some controlling relationship with the sea, but no guarantees against drowning, no particulars of artistic method. Ruby Cohn sees Augustus Carmichael as the "poet of death" and Lily as the "painter of life" in her discussion of the role of art in the novel.6 Perhaps, however, in light of the present discussion, we can say that Mr. Carmichael instructs Lily: both share the experience of loss through death; in some inscrutable way, he serves to suggest that the experience of loss may be modulated into art. Lily, of course, is the artist in the process of becoming; Woolf cannot claim for her surrogate the achievement of having become the artist. Thus Woolf substitutes Mr. Carmichael as the type of the artist, mono? lithic and impersonal in his achieved role. Nevertheless, the development of Lily to the point at which she can discern Mr. Carmichael's unspoken message to her necessitates some form of engagement with Mrs. Ramsay. Mrs. Ramsay is Demeter, an identifica? tion that critics have noted without exploring its use in the text.7 As Demeter, she is both part of and apart from nature, at once the source of life and its protector or cultivator. This identification with Demeter underscores the ritu? al function of woman in marriage and maternity. It is just this pull to ritual participation in marriage and sacrifice of self that Lily must resist.8 For Lily, Mrs. Ramsay is a fount of feeling which must not be denied. At the moment, in Part III, of acknowledging her pain at the loss of Mrs. Ramsay, Lily experiences a rush of tears, a hot liquid in her eyes; in her surrender to emotion, she loses all security: "Was there no safety? No learning by heart of the ways of the world?" (p. 180). Contiguity in the text works together with structural similarity to create equivalence between Lily's sudden rush of feeling and the famous passage in which Macalister's boy mutilates a fish and throws it back into the sea. Such a wounding is emblem? atic of a capacity for feeling, for opening of self to the world. Through this</page><page sequence="5">186 / HOFFMAN equivalence, an instance of internal coding, Lily's necessary wound is concretized: it receives its due in the fisherman's bloody rite. The identification of Mrs. Ramsay with Demeter is made through the vision of several characters and thus occupies a place in the structure of the text beyond the point of view of one, admittedly major, character. In the "parlour of the poky little house where she had taken him," Charles Tansley sees her, in a sudden transfiguration of the ordinary, "Stepping through fields of flowers and taking to her breast buds that had broken and lambs that had fallen; with the stars in her eyes and the wind in her hair" (pp. 13-14). Similarly, William Bankes finds himself struck by the vision of Mrs. Ramsay, "very clearly Greek, straight, blue-eyed" (p. 29). It is the absolute uniqueness of Mrs. Ramsay's beauty that shines through in these passages, a uniqueness that transcends her individual identity, the incongru? ity of a deerstalker's hat and galoshes, worries over money. In this manner, she too comes to occupy a place on the mythic plane. The text both allows for her novelistic particularity and offers a view of her as the transhistorical incarnation of the goddess of nature. In her notes at the start of the manuscript of the novel, Woolf makes jottings as to the place of Mrs. Ramsay's beauty, the manner in which others react to her; she sets herself the task of exploring how other characters see her. Nevertheless, the transfigurations of Mrs. Ramsay that occur through the eyes of Charles Tansley and William Bankes reach their fullest expres? sion in Lily's recollection of the image of Mrs. Ramsay that comes to mind after she heard of her death: "It was strange how clearly she saw her, step? ping with her usual quickness across fields among whose folds, purplish and soft, among whose flowers, hyacinths or lilies, she vanished. It was some trick of the painter's eye. For days after she had heard of her death she had seen her thus, putting her wreath to her forehead and going unquestioningly with her companion, a shade across the fields. The sight, the phrase, had its power to console" (p. 181). Is this the narrativization of loss? Demeter, the source of life, is claimed by death, surrenders to the darkness of the underworld. The mythic identification gives to Mrs. Ramsay a primacy in the world, in nature, appropriate to her centrality in the novel. It expresses a bow to necessity? the fact of loss?but also contextualizes loss and makes it part of a story of eternal return. It is poignant, however, that on the temporal level of plot such mythic return is impossible. It can occur only as the transient, mystical experience of a character. Otherwise the novel would be violating its terms and entering the realm of the marvelous. The impact of loss pushes toward this kind of marvelous restoration, even as the novel denies it. It would be an oversimplification to identify either Mrs. Ramsay or her mythical counterpart, Demeter, with "life," for each is a figure associated with cultivation, with the protection of life against death. Mrs. Ramsay cov</page><page sequence="6">TO THE LIGHTHOUSE / 187 ers a skull with a shawl, urges people to "Marry, marry," facets of her struggle with "this thing that she called life," which she feels to be "terrible, hostile, and quick to pounce on you if you gave it a chance" (p. 60). In the imagery of Demeter, she gathers "to her breast buds that had broken and lambs that had fallen" (p. 14); in her own right, that is, as a character in the plot, she visits the poor and the sick, instructs them in healthful living ("they must keep the windows open and the doors shut" [p. 14]). On an axis that runs vertically through the text, Demeter and Mrs. Ramsay gain a functional identification that can be traced outside the text to Julia Stephen and her well-known devotion to the ill and needy. Mitchell Leaska cites Julia Stephen's observation, in her sole published piece of writing, Notes from Sickrooms: "I have often wondered why it is considered a proof of virtue in anyone to become a nurse. The ordinary relations between the sick and the well are far easier and pleasanter than between the well and the well."9 One senses the extent to which the nurturing function permeated Mrs. Stephen's sense of herself. * * * The Demeter story offers a model of presence and absence in the mother daughter relationship: the mother bereft of daughter, seeking her and with? holding the bounty of nature in her grief, as in the Homeric hymn; the mother who regains the daughter only at the cost of a surrender to darkness, to the lord of the underworld. Jane Harrison offers an approach to Greek mythology that may articulate something of the usefulness of mythological reference for Woolf. The Woolf s printed Harrison's memoirs at the Hogarth Press and Virginia refers to Harrison's work in A Room of One's Own; thus one can assume her familiarity with Harrison's contributions to the study of myth and ancient civilization. "There are," observed Harrison, "no ancient gods; there are ancient reactions, emotions, activities, embodied in represen? tations. It is for us to discover those reactions."10 Such an approach seems remarkably in sympathy with Woolf s use of myth in To the Lighthouse: it underscores the psychological utility of gods and goddesses and virtually invites the reader to make the effort to imagine the states of mind, the needs, out of which such personifications arose. Those who are familiar with Harrison's work know that her particular contributions center on the worship of the Mother and on the mysteries that grew up around her. It may well be that Woolf found reinforcement for her own excavation of the maternal figure in her early life in Harrison's diggings in the past. Harrison draws the contrast between the "Homeric patriarchal Olympus" with its emphasis on the individual, on the one hand, and, on the other, the worship of the Mother; the latter emphasizes "the group, the race and its continuance rather than the prowess of the individual, it focuses on the</page><page sequence="7">188 / HOFFMAN facts of fertility and the fostering of life."11 There is an obvious parallel here to the contrast between Mr. Ramsay, the individualistic intellect par excellence, and his wife, whose dedication to the continuance of the group may at times lead her to disregard individuals and their preferences so long as they "Marry, marry." Harrison's discussions of myth and Woolf 's por? trayal of the mother and the father share a similar sense of the emergence of the individual out of a diffuse maternal ground, bonding between mother and infant. Whether in terms of the development of the individual or of civilization, there is a common concern with the birth of self-consciousness. Although art has existed in every culture, the notion of the self-conscious artist is a relatively recent phenomenon. It is just the fragility of that emer? gence that we sense in Lily, as she struggles to extricate herself from ritual participation in life and to establish the uniqueness of her vision in paint. Indeed, how much more recent is the effort of a woman to identify herself as an artist, the kind of tentative assertion in which Lily so hesitatingly engages. Through the complexity of her effort to portray Mrs. Ramsay, the type of the mother, to plumb her mysteries without being drawn into them and yet without giving her up, Lily attempts a fragile balance. Nancy Chodorow's examination of female identity in The Reproduction of Mothering offers the reader a means of understanding the constellation of mother-daughter relationships in and around To the Lighthouse. As Chodorow puts it, feminine identity is relational and more fluid than masculine identity.12 Women are, as Woolf knows, more capable of becoming the thing they look at. J. K. Gardiner adapts Chodorow's model to the literary situation in ways that are useful for reading Woolf.13 The idea that the "heroine is her author's daughter" sheds light on the network of mother-daughter relations in the novel and around it: Woolf/mother gives birth to Lily/daughter who, in turn, achieves a vision of Mrs. Ramsay/mother that may function for Woolf/daughter as an aesthetic re-creation of her own lost mother. This network of relations dissolves some of the conventional distinctions between author, character, work, in ways that serve Woolf s aesthetic aims as well as her psychological needs. In the novel, this diffuseness of female identity enters the realm of the mystical through the agency of Mrs. Ramsay. In the first section of the novel, Lily goes at the separateness of Mrs. Ramsay as if it were a problem to be resolved into unity: she imagines penetrating "the chambers of the mind and heart" of Mrs. Ramsay and ponders the existence of a "device for becoming, like waters poured into one jar, inextricably the same, one with the object one adored" (p. 51). The status in the text of this passage in which Lily longs to get at the essence of Mrs. Ramsay raises some questions, for it appears to belong less to the actual events or recollection of events in the novel than to an extended imagining, on Lily's part, of a nocturnal visit from Mrs. Ramsay; the passage, vividly detailed and emotionally intense,</page><page sequence="8">TO THE LIGHTHOUSE / 189 offers a kind of textual drift into contemplation of the being of Mrs. Ramsay. In a text that has signalled its abandonment of linearity, such a drift is more likely to occur. Harrison notes the contrast between earlier worship of the Mother god? dess and the later worship of the Olympians: "The Olympian father and indeed all Olympian gods are approached in rational, anthropomorphic fash? ion .. . but the mother is approached by means that are magical and mysterious, she has mysteries. . . . The Mother was never so clearly and fully projected into human form as the Father. The mystery par excellence of the mother was her 'sacred marriage,' a magical ceremony for the induction of fertility."14 Harrison's reading of the myth corresponds to our understanding of the pre Oedipal mother, from whom separation must be achieved. It is appropriate that in the novel Mrs. Ramsay offer the language of fusion at its purest, in a mystical marriage of the sort that Harrison describes: "There rose, and she looked and looked with her needles suspended, there curled up off the floor of the mind, rose from the lake of one's being, a mist, a bride to meet her lover" (p. 64). The confusion of mother and daughter is a notable aspect of the story of Demeter and Persephone.15 In terms of our guiding myth, Prue is Persephone; dutiful daughter that she is, she takes on her mother's role in life, follows her mother into death. The death of Prue receives it bracketed acknowledg? ment several sections after the bracketed notation of Mrs. Ramsay's death. It is at this point that the persona of Demeter pushes into our line of sight in her own right, independent of the character with whom she has been associated: "the spring with her bees humming and gnats dancing threw her cloak about her, veiled her eyes, averted her head, and among passing shadows and flights of small rain seemed to have taken upon her a knowledge of the sorrows of mankind" (p. 132). Beyond Mrs. Ramsay, then, the vision of the sorrowing mother permeates the natural world, mourning seasonal loss and nurturing seasonal renewal. Little matter that Mrs. Ramsay's death has been recorded earlier in "Time Passes": the spring, in its acknowledgment of the "sorrows of mankind," is pressed close up against our awareness of the mother who must yield up her children.16 The bracketed passages in "Time Passes," Part II of the novel, suggest an inversion of the focus on people living in time to a vaster, more impersonal frame of reference where the individual is of little consequence. This inver? sion of perspective can be seen on the level of the sentence: the subject of the sentence shifts from Lily, or Mr. Ramsay, each with her or his effort to wield a verb and achieve something, to the forces of nature in one form or another: "certain airs . . . crept round corners and ventured indoors. Almost one might imagine them, as they entered the drawing-room questioning and wondering, toying with the flap of hanging wall-paper, asking, would it hang much longer, when would it fall?" (p. 126; emphasis mine). In this</page><page sequence="9">190 / HOFFMAN central section of the novel, Woolf attempts to incorporate the perspective of nature, the anonymity of all living creatures, a level of meaning antithetical to the thrust of the novel which works to establish the individuality of its characters. The merciless flow of time is checked here by the efforts of Mrs. McNab who lurches and leers, but essentially dusts and airs. Indeed, it is the telescope beam of Mrs. McNab's recollection of Mrs. Ramsay, Demeter in her gray cloak stooping to gather flowers, that seems to tip the balance in favor of civilization. This eye of memory lifts Mrs. McNab out of the state of nature, terrible in its eyeless indifference, with which she seems at first to be associated. Mrs. McNab stoops too to pick flowers and in that act of caring initiates the process by which she will restore the house, open its windows and shut its doors, the basic defense against nature. As female deity, Mrs. Ramsay is the point of intersection between nature and culture; Mrs. McNab, who seems at first a part of nature yet goes on to take up the struggle against erosion, resembles her in this respect. Thus a kind of structural equivalence occurs between these two women who are united in the common function each performs (Mrs. McNab is perhaps the lowest common denominator of that function). In the manuscript version of the novel, both Mrs. Ramsay and Mrs. McNab possess first names, yet another particularizing detail that is excised from the final version, here in the interests of establishing the common sisterhood of the characters, their absorption in anonymous ritual. The excision of the proper names of Mrs. McNab and Mrs. Ramsay is all the more meaningful in that it points up the contrast between them and the individualists in the novel, Augustus Carmichael and Lily Briscoe.17 * * * As pagan deity, Mrs. Ramsay's ritual feast is the dinner party at which Minta and Paul are served up along with Boeuf en Daube. The candles are lit, the guests drawn round the table as in a magical enclosure within the sea; the doors open to announce the serving up of the Boeuf en Daube and, with a wonderful simultaneity, the pair of young lovers, Minta and Paul. A glance at the manuscript shows the linear sequence with which Woolf began working? the series of entrances into the dining room which she ultimately simplified and wove together to achieve the impression of simultaneity, the ripeness for substitution that the text offers. What is consumed in the ritual feast is as much the pair of young lovers as it is the juicy Boeuf; Mrs. Ramsay has labored long in the preparation of each. Thus, the exhalation with which Paul Ray ley utters "we," sign of the union, constitutes the equivalent to the "scent of olives and oil and juice" that rises from the dish as its cover is removed (p. 100). Ritual offering that they are, "these lovers, these people entering into illusion glittering eyed,</page><page sequence="10">TO THE LIGHTHOUSE / 191 must be danced round wtih mockery, decorated with garlands" (p. 100). It is Mrs. Ramsay's magic, the spell with which she binds them all, as Lily sees it, that enables her to lead her victims to the altar. If we penetrate to the core of the ritual, we find that it is of course the goddess herself who is con? sumed annually in the ritual that has grown around her. Marriage may be Mrs. Ramsay's weapon, but it also joins her to death; ultimately, and repeatedly, it is she who is consumed, who dissolves into the mist at the core of her being to join the bridegroom. In offering a particularly tender piece of eternity to William Bankes, Mrs. Ramsay invites him to partake in ritual, to join in homage to marriage; although he is enchanted, however, William remains a worshipper from afar rather than an initiate. Lily, too, is drawn to the heat of the fire Mrs. Ram? say has ignited: she offers with words to throw herself in as she asks Paul Bayley if she can join him in hunting for Minta's brooch. But her shy offer is a diluted version of participation, the gesture of ambivalence, and her reluctance is confirmed in her inadvertent horror at Paul's response: "He turned on her cheek the heat of love, its horror, its cruelty, its unscrupulosity. It scorched her, and Lily, looking at Minta, being charming to Mr. Ramsay at the other end of the table, flinched for her exposed to these fangs, and was thankful" (p. 102). Lily is saved by her characteristic ambivalence, by the mediating device of the salt cellar, by her capacity to observe others, observe even the workings of passion in them, and so dilute the intensity of her own impulses. Through her concentration on an aesthetic problem, she lifts herself out of ritual participation and the concomitant loss of identity. Lily and William Bankes offer Mrs. Ramsay, goddess of marriage, rever? ence from afar; their friendship constitutes an extremely civilized, sublimat? ed version of the kind of merger the goddess commands. Indeed, their friendship, civilized artifact that it is, survives not only Mrs. Ramsay's wishes that they marry, but her death as well. Following the dinner party, Mrs. Ramsay moves to join her husband, in semi-conscious obedience to "something so strong that she never even thought of asking herself what it was" (p. 117). Each sits and reads: they are togeth? er yet apart, in a scene which may move the reader to think about the signifi? cance of reading itself. Books frame experience and transform it; so too the window in Part I of the novel frames scenes, interior and exterior, and molds the setting as it lets one see through. Thus the window in which Mrs. Ram? say sits, the sonnet that she reads, Lily's painting, the text of the novel?all are structural equivalents of a sort: they frame experience and so turn it into art. Perhaps we can say that each of these modes of structuration permits an interchange to occur. This is the experience of art to which we as readers are given access. Critics have commented on the bookishness of the novel and the man? ner in which allusions amplify our understanding of the characters by adding</page><page sequence="11">192 / HOFFMAN in a level of reference to a common literary heritage.18 Not enough attention has been paid, however, to the kinds of reading in which Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay engage in the concluding scene of Part I, nor to the significance of that scene itself. Each observes the other in the act of reading. Each is transformed by the experience of reading. If there is a consummation that the novel demands at this point, it is obviously refined beyond the sexual, as Mr. Ramsay knows: "The whole of life did not consist in going to bed with a woman, he thought, returning to Scott and Balzac, to the English novel and the French novel" (p. 121). In the original manuscript of the novel, Mrs. Ramsay is seen to be looking at an anthology of poems and to be reading Shakespeare's sonnets, but we are not given access to the nature of the experience?the climbing upwards through the leaves, the tactile contact with the words?that reading is for her. In the novel as we have it, we are given the full effect; in fact as readers we experience it ourselves. Reading serves as a mode of elaborating character within the system of the novel. We have associated Mrs. Ramsay with fusion, maternal bonding, less sense of herself as a conscious being. Mr. Ramsay also loses consciousness of himself when he reads, but remains involved in plot, in what happens to characters. And in this we find the means to understand why he reads prose and she reads poetry. Reading, participating in the life of culture, relieves Mr. Ramsay of the burden of egotism, his concern for individual fame; the deathbed scene in Scott's Antiquary leaves him renewed, "very vigorous, very forthright" (p. 122). He, it appears, assimilates his experience consciously, as a social being, and is reassured about the continuity of civilization. She is brought into contact with deeper forms and so her experience is less communicable. For Mrs. Ramsay, the surrender of self that she undergoes brings her into the rhythm of the words, into a semi-conscious participation in language, until she holds in her hands "beautiful and reasonable, clear and complete, the essence sucked out of life and held rounded here?the sonnet" (p. 121). In "On Being 111," Woolf mulls over the experience of reading in terms that are quite close to those the novel explores. She speaks at the outset of the kind of experience illness makes possible, "when the lights of health go down, the undiscovered countries that are then disclosed," a descrip? tion that might well bring to mind the kind of loss of self Mrs. Ramsay goes through, the capacity to roam anywhere and become anything that she enjoys when she is at rest.19 This is perhaps the very life of the imagination, free of conscious identity, negative capability at its extreme. "On Being 111" is an essay that draws attention, half playfully, half seriously, to the hitherto unexplored delights of reading while ill. It draws a distinction between reading poetry and reading prose that corresponds to the difference between the Ramsays' modes of reading. "Illness," notes Woolf in the essay, "makes us disinclined for the long campaigns that prose exacts. . . .</page><page sequence="12">TO THE LIGHTHOUSE / 193 In health meaning has encroached upon sound. Our intelligence domi? nates over our senses."20 One is reminded here, of course, of the heroic prose voyages of Mr. Ramsay. By contrast, in illness "words seem to pos? sess a mystic quality. We grasp what is beyond their surface meaning, gath? er instinctively, this, that, and the other?a sound, a colour, here a stress, there a pause?. . . the words give out their scent and distill their flavour, and then, if at last we grasp the meaning, it is all the richer for having come to us sensually first, by way of the palate and the nostrils, like some queer odour. "21 It should be apparent that both modes of response form part of the artist's creativity. Similarly, the contrast between Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay points effectively to the significant dimensions of the imagination, the cre? ative intelligence; Lily's task is to incorporate some of each in herself in order to paint her picture. It is the very richness of the novel that it demands both empathy for character and surrender to musical pattern. In this combina? tion we can perhaps locate Woolf s contribution to the novel. Is there a link between the final union of the Ramsays at the end of Part I and Mr. Carmichael's vigil by the light of a candle at the start of Part II? Yes: literature holds the fabric together; the text calls attention to its place in literature. It attempts to give place to the dark, to the longing to fuse, in a text of light, a text that is concerned with reading, with the fate of a com? plete set of the Waverley novels. Consider the dinner party?the ritual con? sumption of the Boeuf en Daube/the pair of lovers. Is reading the text a sublimation of such consumption? Incorporate the literary text, which is to say, read it well, and you have participated in the very civilized ritual of literature. The continuance of the light relies upon precisely this activity. Reading affirms our individuality by lifting us out of ourselves in such a way that we do not lose ourselves. "Yet seem'd it winter still, and, you away,/ As with your shadow I with these did play," reads Mrs. Ramsay at the end of Part I (p. 121), without even real consciousness of the words as such. Yet she has gone to the point, for Shakespeare's sonnet offers a verbal display of spring, the dazzling panoply of nature, evoked in the sonnet only to be revoked, illusion of presence dispelled by the realization of absence which the final couplet finally yields. Shakespeare's sonnet engages in an activity like that of the novel: to evoke the splendor of a vision and then to turn it inside out, to make the receiver aware of its illusory substance. Literary presence, in any other frame of reference, is absence. In Part I of the novel, Lily seeks wisdom through fusion with Mrs. Ramsay. At that point, the more primitive wish to merge?to become like waters in one jar?is stronger in her than the search for answers. The experi? ence of separation from the mother figure, the dislocation of Part II, forms a necessary stage in the differentiation and individuation of the artist.</page><page sequence="13">194 / HOFFMAN The novel as a whole may be said to incorporate Lily's quest for mean? ing and to pose a series of visionary questions as to the permanence of identity and the nature of perception. In Part II, for example, these questions are posed anonymously, in a way that makes them seem to hover between implied author and character: "The mystic, the visionary, walking the beach on a fine night, stirring a puddle, looking at a stone, asking themselves 4What am I,' 'What is this?' " (p. 131). It is Mr. Carmichael who provides the guiding presence, whose instructive company allows for the mediation of experience into art. Thus in Part III, the visionary once again is Lily, who turns to Mr. Carmichael: " 'What does it mean? How do you explain it all?' she wanted to say, turning to Mr. Carmichael again" (p. 179). He, Poseidon? like, has only "to put down his hand where he lay on the lawn to fish up anything he wanted. She looked at her picture. That would have been his answer, presumably?how 'you' and T and 'she' pass and vanish; nothing stays; all changes; but not words, not paint" (p. 179). At the close of Part I, two characters in a text are transformed by the experience of reading that makes possible a kind of joining together within the context of separateness. At the end of Part III, a single character, distinctly unmarried, has a vision, draws a shaky line down the middle of her painting, and is done. With this recording of the vision, verbal rendition of the experience, the novel ends. The kind of completion that the line down the middle consti? tutes is unattainable to Lily in Part I, where she struggles with precisely the same aesthetic problem. But of course, an aesthetic problem does not belong to a rarefied realm; it is part of the world, part of experience. (So, too, Mrs. Ramsay's semiconscious surrender to reading yields the form of the sonnet.) Lily learns through acknowledgment of Mrs. Ramsay in Part III, through giving in to her feelings and venturing out on a plank over the waves. Her gain is made possible through the experience of loss. With the instructive presence of Mr. Carmichael behind her, she is able to push expe? rience into art and to complete her painting. Woolf rewrote that final pas? sage many times, shifting Mr. Carmichael's position in relation to Lily, changing Lily's final statement of her vision from third person to first; appar? ently, she had her necessary ingredients?Lily, the painting, Mr. Carmichael? but had to work to situate them in relation to one another so as to suggest the manner in which Poseidon presides over the novice artist's completion of her work. In Woolf's ultimate vision, Mr. Carmichael absorbs even the suffering maternity of Mrs. Ramsay. Through Lily's eyes, we see him spread his hands "over all the weakness and suffering of mankind" (p. 208), a phrase which recalls earlier images of Mrs. Ramsay and the spring and so incorpo? rates their responsiveness to the natural world. Of course, it is precisely the attitude of benevolent surveillance that differentiates Mr. Carmichael from Mrs. Ramsay. Nevertheless, in Lily's vision, his final gesture incorporates a</page><page sequence="14">TO THE LIGHTHOUSE / 195 salute to the maternal figure: "Now he has crowned the occasion, she thought, when his hand slowly fell, as if she had seen him let fall from his great height a wreath of violets and asphodels which, fluttering slowly, lay at length upon the earth" (p. 208). His gesture accords to Demeter her place, as it sustains the necessary and even regal distance of art.

Two further notes of thanks: first, to fellow members of the Interdisciplinary Colloquium on Psychoanalysis and Literature of the N.Y. Psychoanalytic Institute and to the group's leader, Francis Baudry, M.D.; second, to my students in the course on Women in Modern Literature, spring 1982, at the College at Lincoln Center of Fordham University. 2 To the Lighthouse (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1981), p. 63. Subsequent refer? ences appear in the text. 3 For a discussion of the workings of a dialectical tension in the novel, see Norman Friedman, 'The Waters of Annihilation: Double Vision in To the Lighthouse," ELH, 22 (1955), 61-79. 4 This kinship between Lily and Mrs. Ramsay is often overlooked in discussion of the novel. It corresponds to what Leon Edel refers to as the underestimated bond between Virginia and Leslie Stephen. Edel observes that Stephen "performed a marriage between Virginia and the world of letters," an apt phrase when we think of the concern with marriage or unions of various sorts in To the Lighthouse. Edel goes on to point out that Virginia realized when writing To the Lighthouse how much more she was like her father than her mother.

Love, Virginia Woolf: Sources of Madness and Art (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1977). 8 Lily's dilemma may be elucidated with the help of Sherry Ortner's essay, "Is Female to Male as Nature Is to Culture?" Ortner points out that from the viewpoint of culture, woman is perceived as part of nature; at the same time, woman as conscious being participates in culture and so takes part in the very devaluation of herself as woman. See Woman, Culture and Society, ed. Michelle Rosaldo and Louise Lamphere (Stanford: Stanford Univ. Press, 1974). 9 Mitchell Leaska, The Novels of Virginia Woolf: From Beginning to End (New York: C.U.N.Y., 1977), p. 125. 10 Jane Harrison, Mythology (Norwood, Mass.: Plimpton, 1924), p. 58.</page><page sequence="15">196 / HOFFMAN 11 Harrison, p. 63. 12 Nancy Chodorow, The Reproduction of Mothering: Psychoanalysis and the Sociology of Gender (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1978). 13 Judith Kegan Gardiner, "On Female Identity and Writing by Women," Critical Inquiry, 8 (1981), 347-61. 14 Harrison, p. 16. 15 Harrison makes note of the mother-daughter confusion that surrounds Demeter and Persephone, the Mother and the Maid. Walter Pater also makes note of this confusion in his chapter on Demeter in his Greek Studies. Perry Meisel argues for Pater's influence on Woolf in The Absent Father: Virginia Woolf and Walter Pater (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1980). It is indeed tempting to make a link between Pater's lyrical evocation of Demeter and even his famed description of the Mona Lisa in his Renaissance Studies and Woolf s presentation of Mrs. Ramsay. As Meisel puts it, Pater's Mona Lisa, like his Demeter, is "a master trope or receptacle that gathers up and represents 'the whole human experience' " (p. 109). 16 There are two Demeter-Persephone passages in Part III of the novel, both registered through Lily, as she recalls hearing of Mrs. Ramsay's death. The second closes with the vision of "the three of them together, Mrs. Ramsay walking rather fast in front" (p. 201). If the reader encounters this passage in the course of a simple linear reading of the text, the reference to the three seems somewhat troublesome in its obscurity. We can now, of course, connect the "three" to the mother and her two children whose deaths have been noted for us in the bracketed passages of Part II. Indeed, examination of the manuscript shows that the three were originally identified by name; the more mysterious designation in the novel survives as testimony to the pain of the loss of mother, brother, and sister. 17 Mr. Ramsay, too, lacks a given name and seems never to have possessed one (in the manuscript, that is). In this, we are meant, I think, to unite him with his wife and to see in them, as Lily does, the very model of marriage. 18 For a discussion of literary allusiveness in the novel, see Thomas A. Vogler, Introduction, Twentieth-Century Interpretations of To the Lighthouse, comp. Thomas A. Vogler (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1970). Roland Barthes attempts a systematic study of this kind of encoded allusion in SIZ: An Essay, trans. Richard Miller (New York: Hill and Wang, 1974). 19 "On Being 111" (London: Hogarth, 1930), p. 9.
