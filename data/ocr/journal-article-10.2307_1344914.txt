<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Stranger's Secrets LEO BERSANI To do justice to Camus requires an indifference to literary fashions in the light of which Camus is likely to appear quaintly archaic, as well as to the appeal of a life and a work pervaded by an apparently unassailable integrity. Tough-minded- ness would seem to demand that we ignore those claims to sympathy which made Camus something of a moral hero to many of his readers: the struggle against poverty and illness, Camus' tortured conscience, his suspicion of political theo- ries and positions which might promote or justify human suffering, the simplicity and intensity of his attachment to life, and the accident which brutally vindicated his impressive and useless protest against the unacceptable fact of death. Camus' work has profited from the quietly glamorous nobility of his life. More than that: his urgently sincere tone has obscured the presence in his work of some of the habits of thought and of feeling against which he argued most eloquently. He is a comparatively uninteresting writer, and the quality of his achievement is, for me, all the more vitiated by an indulgence in abstraction, a secretly prideful reticence of feeling, and an easy cynicism, all of which he constantly, and rightly, attacked for their dehumanizing effects on life. I find the moraliste of Le Mythe de Sisyphe and L'Homme revolte a dull and vague thinker; as a playwright, Camus strikes me not only as less inventive or radical than Beckett, Arrabal, and even Ionesco, but also, within the conventions of a more traditional theater of linguistic and psychological coherence, less successful than the Sartre of Huis clos and Les Sequestres d'Altona. Camus' fiction-especially L'Etranger and a couple of stories in L'Exil et le royaume-is another matter, however, and L'Etranger deserves to be discussed as an impressive if flawed exercise in a kind of writing promoted by the New Novelists of the 1950s to the dignity, and oc- casionally narrow rigor, of doctrine. The doctrine is not Camus', but the re- freshed novelistic techniques we find in L'Etranger could nonetheless be thought of as an example and an inspiration for what has now become an excessively theo- retical determination to re-structure the relation between language and psycholo- gy in fiction. Camus' title has been, for criticism, an unfortunate challenge. What exactly is the quality which makes Meursault a "stranger"? Some early readings of the novel-most notably, those of Sartre and Blanchot-inspired dozens of essays in support of the idea that Camus' hero lives only by sensations, that he never synthesizes his experience into "feelings," that he is uncontaminated by any of the psychological and moral fictions by which society attempts to make life coherent and significant. Camus himself might have helped to check this tendency</page><page sequence="2">LEO BERSANIICAMUSI CONFUSIONS in criticism when he remarked, in a 1945 interview for Les Nouvelles litteraires, that he had intended to describe in Meursault "un homme sans conscience apparente." In many quarters, much has indeed been made of that "apparente," and it can be the point of departure for critical praise or critical blame. The blame has perhaps been expressed more impressively, and Camus' sharpest readers have been disappointed by all the consciousness lurking behind the stranger's deceptively blank prose. Nathalie Sarraute, in a few pages of L'Ere du soupqon, has brilliantly unmasked the intellectual behind Camus' sensualist; and Robbe- Grillet points out that ". . . the book is not written in a language as filtered as the first pages may lead one to believe. In fact, only the objects already charged with a flagrant human content are carefully neutralized, and for moral reasons...." Camus the humanist "does not reject anthropomorphism, he uti- lizes it with economy and subtlety in order to give it more weight." Literary communities tend to "wait" for certain literary events; they know what they want, and, in their impatience to see it appear, they may mistake false goods for the real thing. Sartre's tricky underemphasis of those "anthro- pomorphic" elements in L'Etranger which he recognizes perfectly well, and Blanchot's praise of a portrait without "false subjective explanations" certainly have something to do with their determination to free literature from the psycho- logical schemes of La Princesse de Cleves or La Cousine Bette. But to anticipate is happily not entirely to renounce discriminations, and to do Sartre justice, it must be added that he never hailed the non-anthropomorphic novel in the fiction of Francois Mauriac. In other words, however necessary Mme Sarraute's cor- rective view may have become, L'Etranger produced a shock, and if its innova- tions were exaggerated, the exaggerations testify to a certain originality in the work itself. To locate that originality now, however, requires a perhaps unat- tractively austere critique of what made L'Etranger an immediately appealing revelation. The first paragraph of the novel is justly famous: "Today, maman died. Or maybe yesterday, I don't know. I received a telegram from the old people's home: 'Mother passed away. Burial tomorrow. Sentiments distingues.' That doesn't mean anything. Maybe it was yesterday." The point of view is unde- niably peculiar. But why? We are disoriented, quite simply, by the narrator's concern with time. His emotional originality appears to consist in his choosing to develop only the least emotionally charged element in the first sentence: "today." But is it enough to say that "maman died" awakens only his chrono- logical consciousness? The words most strikingly devoid of the feelings conven- tionally associated with a mother's death are not Meursault's at all; they are in the telegram. And there's some ambiguity in Meursault's comment about the telegram. The last sentence suggests that "that doesn't mean anything" refers only to the fact that the day of maman's death can't be guessed from the tem- porally cryptic message, but we may have already read more than this in Meur- sault's judgment. Indeed, the telegram "doesn't mean anything" from the point of view of human emotions; its only response to the drily noted fact of death is a bit of practical information ("burial tomorrow") and a ready-made formula 213</page><page sequence="3">NOVEL SPRING 1970 with which people fill the void of a non-relation by appealing to an enigmatic class of "feelings" somehow "distinguished." Is Meursault's lingering over the question of when his mother died "stranger," more "alienated" than the socially acceptable formulas which announce her death? We may in fact feel that his interest in dates is useful as a pretext for drawing our attention to the inadequacy, even the absurdity of the telegram. Instead of saying explicitly that such formu- las are a mockery of the personal, solemn nature of death, Camus' hero reacts just peculiarly enough to justify his quoting the message he has received and, perhaps above all, to save himself from being charged with too obvious a com- ment about the insignificance of that message. The point has been made about the telegram-it's not a very interesting point, and it presupposes a normal sense of and respect for human feelings-but it has also been effectively under- emphasized by being attributed to a mind apparently bizarre in its own right. In other words, a mildly mystifying concern with the aspect of death having the least obvious human appeal is the narrative medium through which Camus filters, and gives an air of originality to, a piece of social satire. The satire, it could be objected, may be part of Camus' intention, but nothing tells us that the larger criticism implicit in "that doesn't mean anything" belongs to Meursault's point of view. Nothing, that is, except the rest of the novel, ex- cept the numerous passages where Meursault drops hints of all the attitudes and decisions behind a perspective on experience which only hints at such things as attitudes and decisions. There is ample support for Nathalie Sarraute's remark about the intellectual parti pris discernible in Meursault's pointedly neu- tral descriptions of objects and behavior. He acts on some extremely definite, if teasingly presented ideas. When Marie asks him if he loves her, he tells her that her question doesn't "mean" anything, and he opposes a pregnant "No" to her remark about marriage being "a serious matter." To his boss's suggestion that working in Paris would provide a welcome "change of life," Meursault sententiously answers "that one never changed his way of life, that anyway one life was as good as another and the one I led here wasn't at all unpleasant." Meursault doesn't believe in God; he doesn't like policemen; and he has observed others closely enough to regret not having told his lawyer that there's nothing strange or inhuman about him at all: "I wanted to make it clear to him that I was like everyone else, absolutely like everyone else." And although he is "surprised" by the lawyer's asking him if he felt grief on the day his mother died, Meursault manages to come up with a comparatively sophisticated answer: "In all likelihood, I was fond of maman, but that didn't mean anything. All normal people had more or less desired the death of those they loved." The principal interest of the portrait we have of Meursault is that it is unde- veloped. Psychological or intellectual significance doesn't lead us any further in one direction than a question about whether maman died yesterday or today. Nothing arrests Meursault's attention longer than anything else, and the fact that he has found ambition to be futile, or-to judge from the number of sympathetic allusions to her throughout the novel-that he loved his mother, makes all the more striking the equal attention he gives to everything. His non- 214</page><page sequence="4">LEO BERSANIICAMUSI CONFUSIONS analytical sequences are peculiar because of their provocative denials of their own suggestiveness. And it's as if he were defying us to take up that suggestive- ness. The style of L'Etranger is an exercise in setting traps: by his emphases and by his omissions, Meursault tempts us to make mistakes analogous to those the prosecuting attorney will make in the second half of the novel, to say more about him than he says about himself. I'm inclined even to think of Meursault's impressive sensitivity to visual de- tail as another element in Camus' strategy of provocation. What, for example, is the function of the exquisitely refined perceptions in the following passage? Meursault has spent much of the Sunday following his mother's death watching people come and go on the streets under his terrace: Then the street lights abruptly came on, and they dimmed the stars which were beginning to appear in the night sky. I felt my eyes grow tired from look- ing at the sidewalks laden with men and with lights [les trottoirs avec leur chargement d'hommes et de lumieres]. The street lights made the wet pave- ments glisten, and, at regular intervals, the reflections from a trolley were caught by a girl's glossy hair, a smile or a silver bracelet [les tramways, a intervalles reguliers, mettaient leurs reflets sur des cheveux brillants, un sourire ou un bracelet d'argent]. Shortly after, when there were fewer trolleys and the night sky was already black above the trees and the lights, the neigh- borhood, almost imperceptibly, grew empty, until finally the first cat slowly crossed the now deserted street. Then I thought that I should have dinner. My neck hurt a little because I had been leaning for a long time on the back of my chair. I went out to buy some bread and spaghetti. I made my meal and I ate standing up. I wanted to smoke a cigarette at the window, but the night had become chilly and I felt a little cold. I closed my windows and, as I came back into the room, I saw in the mirror part of a table with my alcohol lamp standing next to some pieces of bread. I said to myself that I had gotten through another Sunday, that maman was now buried, that I was going back to work and that, all things considered, nothing had changed. The effects here are various and manipulated with great skill. From "then I thought I should have dinner" to the end of the paragraph, we have a monotony of structure (all the sentences and clauses beginning, in French, with "je" and a passe compose) and a succession of brief, unembellished notations which tend to counteract the ampler rhythms and the richer language of the first half of the paragraph. The style is rather abruptly simplified; the narrator checks a movement toward more eloquent phrasing, and by the end of the paragraph he has, I think, succeeded in partially smothering our sense of his having a taste and a capacity for verbal organizations more complex and more seductively lyrical than "I went to buy some bread and spaghetti" and "I closed my windows." But he has nonetheless revealed a range of expressive resources which may make us wonder why, on the whole, he seems to be deliberately limiting that range. Can it really be the supposedly benumbed, average clerk Meursault who 215</page><page sequence="5">NOVELISPRING 1970 notices how "les tramways, a intervalles reguliers, mettaient leurs reflets sur des cheveux brillants, un sourire ou un bracelet d'argent"? The observation is im- probable, to say the least; the imagination that makes it is not simply fanciful, but also rather painfully fancy. The still life toward the end of the paragraph is more successfully poetic-but what could be more peculiar than our making such discriminations among Meursault's more or less successful ventures into poetic prose? It's peculiar, of course, only because one strain of L'Etranger, be- ginning with "Today, maman died. Or maybe yesterday, I don't know," has been such a loud announcement that he is not a poet. If, on the other hand, we simply grant him his more eloquent strain, the Meursault of "I made my meal and I ate standing up" requires some explanation. Of course, the most urgent explanation is required by the Meursault who, apparently unconscious of the peculiar sequence he thus makes, inserts "maman was buried" between "I had gotten through another Sunday" and "I was going back to work." Is the thinker, the feeler, the poet really convincing when he speaks as if those three thoughts were identical in their emotional neutrality? Meursault profits from the ambiguity of "nothing had changed." If he means that he will go back to work on Monday, he's right; is that what the puzzling "all things considered" ("somme toute") is supposed to convey, or is his parenthetical remark a way of teasing us with a glimpse of some withheld and perhaps complex wisdom? His sensitivity has been amply demonstrated, and it's arbitrarily schematic to say that he is sensi- tive only to appearances and surfaces. His failure to see certain things is shock- ing because he in fact sees so much. As a result, when he "closes up" we are mystified, and his sudden insensitivities strike us as evidence of a purposeful reticence rather than as examples of a "natural" ignorance of familiar emotional reactions. L'Etranger is a mystery story. What is the key to Meursault's pose as a stranger? The function of the crime in L'Etranger is to provide us with that key. It allows, ultimately, for the angry outburst in prison which reveals everything: Meursault's indifference is the form taken by a passion for life when one realizes that death makes all human experience equally unimportant and yet equally precious. I had been right, I was still right, I was always right. I had lived in a certain way and I could have lived in some other way. I had done this and I hadn't done that. I hadn't done a particular thing but I had done something else. So what? It was as if I had waited my whole life for this moment and for that dawn when I would be executed and justified. Nothing, nothing at all was important and I knew why. He [the chaplain] knew why too. From the depths of my future, during all the absurd life I had led, a dark wind had been blow- ing toward me, crossing over years that were yet to come, and that wind levelled out everything people proposed to me during the equally unreal years I was living through. What did I care about other people's deaths, a mother's love, what did I care about his God, the lives people choose, the 2:L6</page><page sequence="6">LEO BERSANIICAMUS' CONFUSIONS fates they elect, since a single fate was to elect me and with me billions of privileged men who, like him, called themselves my brothers. What can this possibly mean? I realize that L'Etranger is not reducible to a logical argument, but this final passage, for all its passion, is an argument, and it's pre- sented as crucial for an understanding of Meursault's life. His execution, as he clearly says, "justifies" his life, which also naturally means that Meursault's imminent death vindicates the way in which he has related his story to us. His logic is simple, and mystifying: since all men die, everything that men do is of equal value. The connection between these two clauses escapes me. From the fact of a common destiny, Meursault-and Camus-jump to the impossibility of preferring anything in life to anything else. It's as if the proposition were being put to us that if two plays had similar endings, everything that goes on in both plays would therefore have to be equally uninteresting. Does Meursault really believe this? "Salamano's dog," he goes on to say, "was as good as his wife . . .," but Celeste "was better than Raymond." And swim- ming in Algeria is apparently better than working in Paris (a "dirty" city where "people have white skins"), just as certain convictions appear to be valid enough to justify the stranger's stubbornly resisting the religious bullying of the ex- amining magistrate and of the prison chaplain. To the extent that death really has "levelled out everything people proposed to" Meursault, we get a hint of the missing logical connection I referred to a moment ago when he speaks of his angry outburst as having "purged" him of evil and "emptied" him of hope. Indeed, death makes hope absurd. It's not simply a question of Meursault's hope for a reprieve, or at least not in a limited sense. The point of the book is that we live, all the time, under a death sentence, and (Le Mythe de Sisyphe confirms this) to be fully aware of that implies an ability and a willingness altogether to abolish hope from life. But since it seems to me very theoretical indeed to argue that since I may die at any time it's absurd for me to hope intensely for some- thing I want to happen next week or next year, we can only say that death has had such a devastating effect on the stranger's life because the only thing he can conceive worth hoping for is immortality. Without a belief in God, death does of course make that hope absurd. That is, Salamano's dog is worth as much as Salamano's wife only for a man interested neither in the dog nor in the wife, but only in his own life everlasting. A metaphysically disappointed, bitter man adopts a pose of defiant indifference toward the world. The indifference seems all the more theatrical and defiant if we try to reconcile it to the concluding, somewhat wilfully optimistic affirmation of life as happy after all in L'Etranger. "As if my fit of anger had purged me of evil, emptied me of hope, in front of this night heavy with signs and with stars, I opened up for the first time to the tender indifference of the world. In feeling the world so similar to myself, in short so fraternal, I felt that I had been happy, and that I was still happy." Certainly there is in Camus, from Noces to L'Homme revolte, a kind of felt accord with the world (expressed best as the pleasure of swimming under the Mediterranean sun) which he writes about with a moving 217</page><page sequence="7">NOVELISPRING 1970 if occasionally stilted eloquence. The problem is that he is also so determined to be a thinker, and in spite of his constant polemic against dehumanizing sys- tematizations of life, Camus himself never ceases to offer some philosophical account for both an invincible need to detach himself from human affairs and an innocent, lazy sensuality which of course needs no justification at all. The end of L'Etranger illustrates some of the resulting confusions. We could probably go along with the assertion, implied in L'Etranger and explicitly made in Le Mythe de Sisyphe, that the passion for beauty and the capacity for enjoy- ment can be intensified if we cure ourselves of the temptation to penetrate the surfaces of things in the hope of finding a universe sympathetic to man's condi- tion, a universe of reassuring transcendental significances. The final ambition of "une pensee absurde," Camus writes in Sisyphe, is simply "to describe"; and the work of art-as well as the joy of life-is born of a willingness to give up attempting to find meanings and depths in the concrete. ("L'oeuvre d'art nait du renoncement de l'intelligence a raisonner le concret.") But is a night "heavy with signs" a description of something concrete? Is a "fraternal" world whose indifference is "tender" one that has genuinely lost the transcendence we wish- fully project on it? And, finally, we come back, in another form, to the first and major difficulty I've indicated. The indifference of the universe to our desires may, logically, inspire either suicidal despair or a sort of passion, cleansed of the need for transcendental reassurances, for the strictly natural and the strictly human. But how can that renewed passion for life not be full of explicit dis- criminations? With nothing more to know and to hope for than what we can know and hope for here, the necessity for an art of exclusions and commit- ments becomes all the more immediate and urgent. It's precisely the disap- pearance of transcendence in the universe which makes indifference spiritually obsolete, and its persistence in Camus suggests an unconfessed nostalgia for the comforts of transcendence, for the comforts of an absolute. I don't want to judge L'Etranger by the philosophical deficiencies of Le Mythe de Sisyphe, and the objections I've raised seem to me justified by a reading of the novel, which, perverse as it may now seem to say it, is far more interesting than the essay. The weaknesses in Camus' more or less philosophical writings have been competently spelled out by John Cruickshank, an admirer of Camus; he has, in Albert Camus and the Literature of Revolt, some very good things to say about the different meanings of the word "absurd" in Le Mythe de Sisyphe, the confusion about how "logic" is to be interpreted at the beginning of the essay, and the ambiguities in Camus' use of the word "revolt" in L'Homme revolte. I would simply add that the entire argument in Le Mythe de Sisyphe depends on the nostalgia I just mentioned for the securities of religious faith. The absurd in Camus presupposes a need for cosmic unities and ultimate mean- ings which Camus presents as an unarguable fact of human nature. "The absurd is born of this confrontation between what men call out for and the irrational silence of the world." And Camus sets out to examine whether life's absurdity demands that we escape from life by either suicide or hope, both of which he will judge to be unsatisfactory solutions. But these unacceptable consequences 218</page><page sequence="8">LEO BERSANIICAMUS' CONFUSIONS are really premises without which the argument would never have gotten started in the first place. It's precisely the "meeting" of hope and suicidal despair which creates the sense of the absurd, and the silence of the world is neither rational nor irrational unless we take for granted the "desire for happiness and reason," the need for unity and transcendental order which Camus would present as independent of his description of the world. That is, there is no "confrontation" between "l'appel humain" and the world's "irrational silence," but rather a single, emotionally prejudiced description of the world. The absurd man, Camus announces, doesn't believe in the profound or hidden meanings of things. But of course-and it's impossible to break out of the circle-there wouldn't be any absurdity unless man thought it inconceivable that the world should be without profound and hidden meanings. Absurdity, as Robbe-Grillet has seen, is "a form of tragic humanism"; it is a metaphysical romance between man and the uni- verse, "a lover's quarrel, which leads to a crime of passion." Camus, less reticent in his essays than his heroes are in his novels and stories, reveals a schematic, abstract mind which, finally, it's impossible to penetrate. Meursault's and Rieux's temperamental reticence is paralleled by an undoubtedly unconscious philosophical obfuscation in Camus the moraliste. Perhaps his most admirable sentence is a plea for verbal directness and honesty: "Every ambigu- ous expression, every misunderstanding gives rise to death; only a clear language, the use of simple words, can save us from that death." It's extraordinary that this warning should be made in L'Homme revolte, a book in which experience is so desiccated by abstract dualisms-revolt versus revolution, totality versus unity, nature versus history, "German dreams" versus "the Mediterranean tradi- tion"-that it makes no sense at all except as a bizarre and unsuccessful stylistic exercise in the lyricism of abstract antinomies. Camus is an ideal example of the writer unable or unwilling, to use Proust's phrase, to express the "fundamental notes" of his personality. His writing is, on the surface, a marvel of discipline: so much rigor would seem to be necessary to maintain the equilibrium of sen- tences structured by contrapuntal abstractions. But these balances easily become a habit, a tic, and we find a stylistic version of Meursault's apathy in the torpor with which Camus seems to float on the surfaces of his linguistic vaguenesses and confusions. The Proustian criterion for judging literature-according to the depths of self "sounded" by style-is not, as we can see in Roussel, Robbe-Grillet, Pinget, and Beckett, the only imaginable basis for critical appreciation. And Proust him- self subverts his own theoretical notion of a kind of monotonously profound self-expressiveness as the sign of genius in art by his avid exploitation of local narrative occasions in A la Recherche for unexpected and unpredictable self- renewals. But with Camus we don't have the impression of a fundamental re- vision of the very notion of self-expression in art. He in no way contests the assumptions about personality in traditional fiction, and he even complained about the fact that modern novelists had lost the secret of portraying characters in depth. Camus is not moving away from a "center" of psychological pressures or fixed patterns toward either the liberatingly evasive ironies of Stendhal, or the 219</page><page sequence="9">NOVELISPRING 1970 self-multiplications of Proust, or the attempted ecriture blanche of psychological neutrality in Robbe-Grillet and Blanchot. He is, on the contrary, a classical writer -a writer, that is, whose sentences tend to be portentous understatements of implied depths in the self and in the world. The classical style refers us to unex- pressed and perhaps inexpressible realities beyond language; it closes in on those realities and, as it were, picks up their echoes without ever claiming to embody adequately the realities themselves. "Mon mal vient de plus loin," Phedre sug- gestively says; the subjects in Racine and Mme de La Fayette are, in effect, at a certain remove from the works which treat them, at a distance never crossed by the language which ceremoniously points at them. But whereas Racinian verse picks up the echoes, Camus' language merely seals off the accesses to opinions and feelings easily articulated, or it creates a smoke screen of systematic thought which smothers all psychological resonance. It is, in other words, a kind of parody of classical pudeur and of the classical litote. With Meursault, we have a mystifying character who is finally revealed to us as having no mystery at all but only a logically dubious philosophical position. He is, alas, also the occasion for a shallow social polemic. A crude attack on supposedly conventional habits of thought allows Camus to exaggerate his own imaginative capacity for the psychologically unexpected. Superficially, L'Etranger seems to expose the emptiness of psychological and moral fictions by which society attempts to control and make coherent an individual's behavior. The novel appears to attack the very activity of novelizing, even to subvert its own existence, by demonstrating the irrelevance of any stories one might invent about Meur- sault's life. We could think of the trial as a novelistic competition between the prosecuting and the defense attorneys. The raw material is provided by what Meursault does in the first half of the book; using that material, each of the lawyers tries his hand at spinning a yarn about Meursault's "soul." We know that they are both wrong: Meursault is neither the insensitive monster described by the prosecutor nor the tireless, faithful employee and compassionate spirit sketched by the defense. But the satire against such simplifications turns curiously against itself. For Camus takes the risk of making the prosecutor's version of Meursault's behavior an immensely probable one. It's not the true story, but, for anyone who, unlike the reader, is living outside Meursault's mind, it cer- tainly represents an intelligent and wholly plausible deduction. Meursault's be- havior at his mother's funeral, the affair he begins with Marie just two days later, his testifying for Raymond, and his returning to the beach with a gun: it takes, actually, very little ingenuity to interpret so many coincidences as fitting into a consistent pattern of heartless, deliberately criminal behavior. When Meursault tells the judge that he killed the Arab "because of the sun," people in the courtroom laugh-but why shouldn't they laugh? The fact that Meursault pulled the trigger probably in order to shake off an unbearable physical discom- fort in no way detracts from his being a man about whom a fairly intelligible and definitive story can be told-a story to which his remark about the sun hardly does justice. If the people at Meursault's trial are ridiculous, it's just be- 220</page><page sequence="10">LEO BERSANI CAMUS' CONFUSIONS cause they have the disadvantage of being outsiders, and not because anything in the novel has convincingly shown us that human experience can be lived fragmentarily, without unifying intentions, conceptions, and feelings. It's therefore not the story-telling process which is being satirized in L'Etranger, but rather a certain class of fictions, and they are of course the easiest fictions in the world to make fun of. Camus has a very crude view of the taboos, expectations, and ideals which organize life in society. The examining magistrate and the prosecutor are parodies of religious fervor and social morality, and Camus' failure to imagine any better alternatives to Meursault suggests the kind of cynical simplifications about human behavior which will occupy al- most the entire field in La Chute. Now Camus is, at his best and at his worst, profoundly mistrustful of speech. I say at his best because, whatever function verbal reticence may serve for Camus, it works, in his fiction, to create his most moving scenes, such as the communion in silence or near silence between Tarrou and Rieux as they swim, and between Daru and the Arab in "L'Hote." But these dramatic successes are too infrequent, and in contexts too ambiguous, to make us forget the imprecise nature of the critique of language which they presuppose. Camus' distrust of speech often seems to serve as an excuse for not being clear and explicit when we feel that he needs most to be clear and explicit. In La Peste, what does Tarrou mean by "peace"? What does Rieux mean by "sympathy"? What is the exact personal meaning of that "hope" which makes Rieux different from Tarrou? Does anything in La Peste satisfactorily refute Cottard's conten- tion that "the only way to bring people together is to send them the plague"? Perhaps the saddest thing in Camus' fiction is the end of the plague-the end, that is, of a fraternity which Camus clearly has difficulty imagining except in the midst of crisis. With a language frequently sentimental, evasive, and abstract, Camus controls and masks what seems to be a desperately cynical view of human possibilities. His reticence keeps him from developing, and overexposing, a tritely disabused strain in his work which we catch a glimpse of when Caligula (and Camus?) stupidly thinks it "clear" and "logical" to say that human life can't be important if money is important; a strain of bitterness which explains the obscure but crucial role of Cottard in La Peste, and which is supported by an intellectual mediocrity most embarrassingly evident in Clamence's facile ex- posure of human egotism in La Chute. Camus is explicitly suspicious of language as a source of misunderstandings, and misunderstandings, as he writes in L'Homme revolte, can lead to death; to this admirable caution, however, we should perhaps also add a suspicion of self in the light of which Camus' cryptic style may appear to apply the brake to a spontaneous flow of cynical mockery. The trick which I see L'Etranger attempting to carry off consists in making us attribute the value of a fundamental critique of fictions to an easy satire of some official moral cliches. Meursault is as much an interpreter as the prosecuting attorney, but his quietness creates the illusion that he lives unreflectively, and his purely moral advantage over the other characters can be confused with the epistemological superiority of being able to live a naturally insignificant life, of being able to resist the impulse to fictionalize which conveniently simplifies 221</page><page sequence="11">222 NOVELISPRING 1970 and unifies experience. In part, L'Etranger is Camus' attempt not to give in to what he calls in L'Homme revolte the novelist's "unreasonable"-but admirable -desire to "correct" life, to transform its meaningless fragments into a sig- nificant "destiny." But Camus tended to confuse the particular form of tradi- tional French fiction with form itself. The art of that fiction, he wrote in an essay of 1943, is a "revenge" on life, "a way of rising above a difficult fate by imposing a form on it." The trite and unviable distinction which this implies between formless experience and the forms of art undoubtedly made it all the more dif- ficult for Camus to conceive of ways of organizing life radically incommensurable with the prosecutor's third-rate novelizing. Because he had little imagination for behavioral structures other than those proposed by the classical French novel, Camus makes of Meursault simply an undeveloped classical character. He can't carry through what appears to be the project of creating an insignificant charac- ter (which he probably confused with an effort to portray formless experience), and, on the other hand, his only idea of significance is a conventional one. Con- sequently, nothing is more artificial in L'Etranger than the passages meant to be most natural. Meursault's wilful refusal to make causal connections explicit, his pose as a man without feeling or thought, are manifestations of a merely queer personality. There is indolence in his reticence, there is perversity in his indolence, and a frustrated desire for immortality explains his perversity. In short, he is a character of several layers, and the easily dissipated strangeness of the novel consists in the hero's tactical postponement of the information which finally allows us, unlike the prosecutor, to detect and read his soul. Where, then, is the residual originality of L'Etranger? In the psychological margin created by their proud reticence, Camus and Meursault divert themselves in appealingly eccentric ways. The latter pastes an ad for Kruschen salts in an old notebook where he keeps things from newspapers which amuse him. Like Tarrou in La Peste, Meursault is attracted by mildly odd behavior. Tarrou is the chronicler of the old man who delightedly spits on cats from his balcony, and Meursault follows into the street the "strange little woman" who, while having dinner in Celeste's restaurant, checks off a dozen or so pages of radio programs in a magazine with rapid, machine-like precision. In prison, Meursault reads "thousands of times" the story, which he finds both "improbable" and "natural," of the Czech who returns to his native village after an absence of twenty-five years and is killed for his money by his mother and sister. He had stopped at their inn and, with the idea of surprising them, had failed to reveal his identity. Now this bizarre story "means" nothing, although, interestingly enough, Meur- sault manages to find a moral in it: ". . . it seemed to me that the traveler had partially deserved [what had happened to him] and that one should never play games." The failure of Le Malentendu, the play inspired by the Czech's story, is due largely to Camus' own inability to leave the story alone. Its weirdness is diluted by the banal message that "when one wants to be recognized, one gives one's name . . .," and the incident serves as a pretext for some absurdist philoso- phizing on the part of the mother and a hymn to the sea on the part of Martha,</page><page sequence="12">LEO BERSANIICAMUSI CONFUSIONS who seems to kill because she can't stand living in a country without a coastline. Camus' attraction to the subject of Le Malentendu is the most interesting thing about the play; the work itself, on the other hand, illustrates how unprepared he is to treat such an anecdote without offering a moral and intellectual justi- fication for it. The incident is much more successfully taken up in L'Etranger, where, except for Meursault's final remark about it, it's simply a gratuitous, un- illuminating, and inexplicable bit of narrative. But, from a certain point of view, that's exactly what L'Etranger itself is. Knowing as we do that Meursault is not a criminal, what could be more bizarre than the accumulation of circumstances which make it inevitable that he be judged as a criminal? L'Etranger, like the Czech's story, is an anecdote of freakish coincidence. It says nothing at all about the absurdity of life, as Camus defines that in Le Mythe de Sisyphe; rather, the novel is such an ingenious concoction of chance events that we can hardly not feel how exceptional Meursault's destiny is. Instead of dramatizing a confrontation between the human need for unity and significance and the "unreasonable silence" of the world, L'Etranger studies one of those rare occasions in life in which there does seem to be a perverse, non- human intention which deprives us of our freedom by making each of our ges- tures fit into a rigorously significant pattern. Le Malentendu and L'Etranger are dreams of coherence, or rather nightmares of coherence. They satisfy, in a cruel parody, the nostalgia for unity; their horror is not the horror of insignificance, but rather of an inescapable significance which organizes separate gestures into an unintended and tragic unity. Indeed, L'Etranger is, like Oedipus Rex, a tragedy of chance; but whereas Oedipus's unintentional crimes are written in the book of a more than human fate, there is nothing to account for Meursault's imprisonment in his chain of coincidences. Nothing except Camus' intention, as this unhappily atheistic author plays the role, in L'Etranger as in Le Malen- tendu, of a demonic unifier of experience. The random is perversely transformed into the significant, and our interest in such stories could be explained by the temporary guarantee they offer, their catastrophic content notwithstanding, of a kind of order and logic in the universe. The order, however, is a mock one, and the elaboration of such stories as Meursault's and Jan's is of course meant to draw our attention to the lack of a sensible order in life. But the stories are too peculiar to lend themselves to gen- eralization; their very improbability undercuts the ingenious but deceptive co- herence they unconvincingly celebrate. What we are left with is a test of the frankly bizarre as a legitimate inspiration for literary fictions. The watertight case which coincidence builds against Meursault is coherent but meaningless, and the very writing of L'Etranger suggests an interest in literature as an exercise in the improbable and the irrelevant. As I've shown, Camus was undoubtedly also interested in what he took to be serious social and philosophical issues in writing L'Etranger. But the novel is original and liberating, I think, to the extent that we can neglect those issues and respond to the provocative amount of space given to the trivial and to the bizarre. In its veiled ambition to be a "profound" novel, L'Etranger is mediocre. But 223</page><page sequence="13">NOVELJSPRING 1970 the curiously meticulous descriptions of gestures and appearances; the partially successful displacement of emphasis from psychological probing to such novel- istically "light" details as Meursault's wondering if his mother died today or yesterday, or his telling us why he prefers to wash his hands at noon rather than in the evening (the office towels are drier at noon); the narrative allowance made for the little mechanical woman and for the story of the Czech; and, more gen- erally, the weirdness of the plot itself-we can easily see how all this might stimulate fiction into new directions. At its best moments, L'Etranger illustrates the appeal and the workability of the irresponsible. A Balzacian digression is always illustratively responsible to the story which it only appears to interrupt; and Marcel's analytical and descriptive wandering in A la Recherche du temps perdu is after all part of the experiment in self-expansion which is the novel's subject. L'Etranger, on the other hand, hints at what a literature of psycho- logically inexpressive ingenuities would be like. Camus would certainly not have been satisfied with being remembered for that. He saw L'Etranger as the first stage in "a kind of difficult progression toward a saintliness of negation-a heroism without God-in short, toward human purity." Meursault is the point zero "on the road of a perfection without any reward." In 1955, Camus again spoke of Meursault as an image of "a truth which is still negative, the truth of being and of feeling, but without which no conquest over the self and over the world will ever be possible." Nothing, how- ever, prevents us from ignoring such morally precious pretensions, and from seeing in L'Etranger an interesting illustration of both the persistence and the subversion of personality in modern literature. Even in the much more radical experiments of Robbe-Grillet and of Beckett, the psychological neutralizing of language (in the former) and the desperate mockery of language's expressiveness (in the latter) are somewhat undermined by the transparent and ironically reas- suring presence of psychological continuities. On the other hand, to the extent that the thrust of contemporary fiction is away from secure and limiting centers of self-definition, Camus deserves to be mentioned for those strategies of psy- chological dislocation which L'Etranger imperfectly exploits. Les Gommes, Robbe-Grillet's first published novel, is an exquisitely programmed exploitation of the literary possibilities of extravagant coincidence-possibilities which, as we have seen, L'Etranger already plots. But whereas Camus' narrative originality appears to be almost the accidental virtue of an attempt to obscure a conventional metaphysical protest, techniques similar to Camus' will be used by later writers in an effort to escape from the assumptions about reality implicit in that protest. The artificial, the arbitrary, and the psychologically inexpressive in contemporary art are ambitious wagers in the name of a range of being even more uncon- strained by the given or by the past than the continuous self-re-creation of A la Recherche du temps perdu. The very bareness of the French New Novel, its apparently limited, even specialized vision of the real, is first of all a dismissal of any predefined range of being, and, most excitingly, it is the sign of a literary -and more than literary-availability to the possible and to the new. 224</page></plain_text>
