<plain_text><page sequence="1">From Divine Shape to Angelic Being: The Career of Akatriel in Jewish Literature* Daniel Abrams / Jerusalem The creation of man in the image of God (Gen. 1:26) has historically been the focus of theological inquiries not only into the nature of man but also of God. And although the Hebrew Bible declares that Moses cannot see God's face and live, it tries to distance itself from a literal reading which would attribute shape to God, declaring that "You cannot see my face, for man may not see Me and live" (Exod. 33:20). Other biblical verses, however, plainly state man's viewing of the divine (Exod. 24:10; Isa. 6:1). In a study on anthropomorphism and theophany, James Barr argued that the Hebrew Bible draws the distinction between God's form and the appearance which man may see. According to Barr, we must speak of the Hebrew Bible's acceptance of anthropomorphic theophanies, but not necessarily of a divine form.' In some biblical texts at least, angels are therefore to be viewed as the accompaniment of an anthropomorphic appearance and not the mitigation of an earlier doctrine concerning the divine form. Later Jewish texts expanded on the emotive description of the divine in the Bible, attributing to God personality which interacts with that of man. The Rabbinic doctrine of anthropomorphism, however, went beyond that of the Bible. While both describe God in human terms, var- ious Rabbinic texts describe God in corporeal terms, for example, par- taking in rituals which require physical attributes.2 These Rabbinic * This study was made possible through a grant from the Memorial Foundation for Jew- ish Culture.

The various modern scholars who have discussed this problem have tried to show that either God does indeed possess a definite shape in at least some Rabbinic texts or that anthro- pomorphism was always used figuratively as an accepted means of expression.3 Many Jewish mystical texts of the Middle Ages embraced some doctrine of divine anthropomorphism or incarnation. Indeed, a major theme un- derlying many theosophical texts of the Kabbalah is the arrangement or hierarchy of the ten ontological grades of the divine theosophy (sefirot) according to a human shape.4 More interesting for the question of the origins and function of anthropomorphism in Rabbinic texts and their possible connection to various forms of ancient Jewish mysticism is the measure of the divine body, the Shi'ur Qomah. The Shi'ur Qomah was de- scribed in the Hekhalot literature as the human shape of God.5 Its de- tailed measurements were so great that they too have been understood to be taken figuratively by various scholars.6 This same body of literature also describes the ascension of Enoch and his transformation into the angelic Metatron. When these texts were received in the circles of the German Pietists and shortly thereafter among the first Kabbalists, Meta- tron was identified with the Shi'ur Qomah, in effect bridging the gap be- 3 The first comprehensive study is A.

Although Rabbinic literature knows of Metatron, placing him on a throne next to God in the celebrated story of the four who entered the Pardes (mystical "garden") and where Elisha ben Abuye mistakes him for a second deity, Metatron is by no means the sole expression of divine anthropomorphism in Rabbinic literature. A more striking and direct presentation of the divine form is found in the episode of the Babylonian Talmud where Akatriel appears before Rabbi Ishmael. The nature of Akatriel, literally, "the crown of God," or "God crowned," is not clearly defined in this context, leaving much room for interpretation by later figures. At one extreme of the spectrum, Akatriel is identified as God himself, physically manifesting himself in the holy of holies. At the other extreme, Akatriel is distanced from all things divine, relegated to the world of created angelic beings. The origins and career of Akatriel therefore parallel that of Metatron, who has been interpreted as both angel and God.8 The names Metatron and Akatriel appear at first glance to be those of angels, while in Rabbinic literature their appearance is compared to that of the divine (if not equated with it). This study traces the history of interpretations of this Rabbinic aggadah and shows how Akatriel underwent various metamor- phoses as he was appropriated by various systems of thought. Further, it argues that the tradition of Akatriel as the expression of the divine shape predates that of Metatron in Rabbinic literature and was all but sup- planted in later literature, beginning with the Amoraic period on through the medieval period. Although Akatriel had receded to the back- ground ofJewish literature, his original importance as the anthropomor- phic form of the divine was only appreciated after the crystallization of classical medieval Kabbalah, when the boundaries between God, angel, and man were codified. 7 See Moshe Idel, "Enoch is Metatron," Immanuel 24/25 (1990): 220-40. See his forthcom- ing study, "Metatron-Comments on the Development of Jewish Myth," in Myth in Jewish Thought, ed. H. Pediah (Ber Sheva: Ben Gurion University Press, 1995; in Hebrew), where he terms the upward and downward movement, respectively, as "apotheosis" and "theoph- any." See also the tradition recorded in Midrash Bereshit Rabbati, ed. Chanoch Albeck (Jeru- salem: Wahrmann, 1940), p. 41, where Prov. 30:4 ("who ascended into heaven and de- scended") is understood to refer to Akatriel. 8 I have discussed the career of Metatron in my study, "The Boundaries of Divine Ontol- ogy: The Inclusion and Exclusion of Metatron in the Godhead," Harvard Theological Review 87 (1994): 291-323. 45</page><page sequence="4">The Journal of Religion THE BABYLONIAN TALMUD Akatriel first appears in the celebrated passage of the Babylonian Talmud (Berachot 7a) where Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha views him in the innermost chamber of the Temple. This passage follows a discussion about the phy- lactaries God wears and a brief discussion concerning the prayer God recites in order that his attribute of mercy will overcome his attribute of justice: It has been taught on Tannaite authority: Said Rabbi Ishmael b. Elisha, "One time I went in to offer up incense on the innermost altar and I saw the crown of the Lord [Akatriel, YaH], enthroned on the highest throne, and he said to me, "Ishamel, my son, bless me". I said to him "may it be your will that your mercy overcome your anger, and that your mercy prevail over your other attributes, so that you treat your children in accord with the trait of mercy and in their regard go beyond the strict measure of the law". And he nodded his head to me.9 Inasmuch as he is seated on the highest throne and speaks of his own attributes, Akatriel is at the very least a supreme angel in this passage and at the most the enthroned form of the divine himself. I am inclined to accept the latter reading because Akatriel is not directly designated as an angel and is termed YaH, sharing part of the divine name.' A more skep- tical reading would argue that God does not take on a physical, and thereby visible, form, and Akatriel therefore represents God only to the extent that he is the angelic agency of God which manifests itself in the created and finite world. To be sure, such a determination is based on an interpretive reading of the passage which is dependent on a specific the- ory of the Rabbinic doctrines of angelology, anthropomorphism, and in- carnation." While one might claim that even the first reading is based on a specific orientation not grounded in the text, there is no indication that Rabbi Ishmael has entered into a dream state, that the episode is in fact I Neusner, p. 194, Neusner's translation. Of note is Leopold Zunz's view that this passage is relatively late. See his Die gottesdienstlichen Vortiige derJuden (Frankfurt am Main: J.

Chananel citiert wird]." 10 Previous scholars who have understood Akatriel as identical with the deity according to this talmudic passage include William Rosenau, "Some Notes on Akatriel," in Sonderdruck aus der Paul Haupt Festschrift (Leipzig: J. C. Hinrichs'sche Buchhandlung, 1926), pp. 103-5; Gustaf Dalman, Aramdisches-Neuhebrdisches Handworterbuch (Frankfurt am Main: J. Kauff- mann, 1922), p. 18; and the note by Y.

Wolfson distinguishes between incarnation, with its ontological implications, and anthropomorphism, defined as a representational mode of the divine taking on a human personality. 46</page><page sequence="5">The Career of Akatriel a parable, or even that Akatriel is an angel, all interpretations which emerge in the Middle Ages. Manuscripts of the Babylonian Talmud differ from the printed text and cause me to amend the above translation. For example, all manu- scripts agree in naming Akatriel Akatriel YaH YWY Zeva'ot or Akatriel YaH YYYZeva'ot to include a representation of God's four-letter name.'2 More pertinent to the identification and role of Akatriel is the way in which Rabbi Ishmael addresses his response. (It is here being assumed that Rabbi Ishmael addresses his prayer to Akatriel in the above passage and does not distinguish him from a higher or separate aspect of the divine.) At least three manuscript versions of this address have survived. The most common version, found in most medieval copyings, omits any quali- fier and follows the translation provided above.'" The second version can be found in what is recognized to be the most important manuscript of the Talmud as a whole. There, Rabbi Ishmael responds by addressing "The Master of the Universe" to further clarify the object of Ishmael's blessing."4 A third version preserved in a geniza fragment in Oxford from the tenth or eleventh century includes an even sharper reading, where Rabbi Ishmael requests: "May it be your will, Lord My God ... .."5 These variations in the text seem to point to an uneasiness with the nature of Akatriel. If, on the one hand, the geniza fragment has pre- served the original version, then it could well be argued that the original intent of the author(s) was to identify Akatriel with God.'6 The omission of the divine name would therefore be the mitigation of this identifica- 2 Jacob Lauterbach, "Substitutes for the Tetragrammaton," Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research 2 (1930-31): 39-67. Rosenau suggested that YaH Y' Zeva'ot might be an interpolation of an early marginal gloss which sought to explain the text.

Other manuscripts consulted include Ms. Oxford 266, fols. 2d-3a, and Ms. Paris, Bibliotheque Nationale 631, fol. 196a, copied, respectively, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. These manuscripts lack the appellation "Master of the Universe." For a description of these and other manuscripts of the Talmud, see N.

Smaller differences include "And I said to him" (*') vs. "And I said before him" (1-,13) and Akatriel "who sits on a high and exalted throne" (arn, Kfrnw) vs. Akatriel "who is seated" (nvw). Might this difference refer to the permanent vs. incidental role of Akatriel as the enthroned form? Such an interpretation can be found in Naftali Treves Herz's Commentary to the Prayers (Thiengen: Elieazer Herz, 1560, 4nx) regarding a passage in the liturgy which reads u',rn 15rn or, alternatively, a , 15r1n.

If, on the other hand, one were to claim that the divine name had been added at this early stage and the complete Talmud manuscript pre- serves the more original version, then the geniza fragment has incorpo- rated a gloss which strengthens the identification in the face of criticism prior to the emergence of the Kabbalah in medieval Europe. HEKHALOT LITERATURE The passage from Berachot does not play a prominent role in the antique or early medieval body of Jewish mystical texts collectively known as the Hekhalot literature; rather, it was interpolated into later manuscript copyings and reworkings of these texts. One such passage demonstrates a knowledge of the talmudic text versions cited above. Here, a marginal gloss in the same hand adds the tetragrammaton to Rabbi Ishmael's re- sponse before Akatriel and marks a deletion over the words "Master of the Universe," indicating that one should replace the other."7 In this same manuscript which contains a later reworking of the various Hekhalot texts,18 Akatriel Ya YHWH Zevaoth speaks to Rabbi Ishmael (par. 130). A similar claim as that just cited can be extended to this passage. Indeed, as Peter Schafer has commented, "Akatriel is here clearly God himself, who, however, functions as an angel of revelation."

J. Dan, however, warns us not to use the term "angel" too readily in these cases. See his "Anafiel, Metatron and the Creator," Tarbiz 52 (1983): 448-57, esp. 448, n. 5. As noted above, this "new" view determined by the addition of the divine appellation can be found already in the manuscripts of the Talmud.

See, however, par. 667, where Akatriel is mentioned as one of a series of angels. 48</page><page sequence="7">The Career of Akatriel Pietists there can be found a passage not found in the other manuscript copyings of the Hekhalot literature. Hugo Odeberg first published this passage from manuscripts not included in Schifer's edition: "In this mo- ment Akatriel Yah JWHW of the Hosts spoke and said to Metatron, the Prince of the Countenance, 'Let no prayer that he prays before me return void. Hear his prayer and fulfill his desire, great or small."'20 Odeberg comments that Akatriel "is here in all probability a name of the Most High, not an angel." Gershom Scholem concurs, understanding Akatriel to be "one of the names of God as He appears on the throne."2' Indeed, Aka- triel gives instructions to Metatron as only God does in other passages of Hekhalot texts. In yet another Hekhalot manuscript there can be found another unique passage (par. 310) where Akatriel is called Akatriel YWY, the Lord of Israel, making this claim even stronger. The text continues with a listing of God's thirteen attributes.22 The boundary between Akatriel and God is best expressed, however, in paragraph 597 of the Hekhalot texts, where Akatriel replaces Metatron as the enthroned being whom Elisha ben Abuye viewed during his ascent to the (heavenly) Pardes.23 In this aggadah, which is preserved among other places in the Babylonian Talmud, Hagiga 15a, Elisha confuses this seated form with the divine and claims that there are indeed "two de- ities." 24 20 The translation follows that of Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, p. 52. Compare Hugo Ode- berg, 3 Enoch, or the Hebrew Book of Enoch (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1928), p. 42. This text can be found as well in "'Hilkhot Metatron' in Eleazar of Worms," Sodei Razaya, Ms. Vatican 202, fol. 116a-b, and the recently rediscovered manuscript of Hekhalot collecta- nea once housed in Vienna.

The Geonim are espe- cially sensitive to the physical representation of God as they were de- fending themselves against the attacks of the Karaites, who accused the Rabbinic community of an anthropomorphic view of the divine. So, for example, Salmon ben Yeruham states that "whoever says and believes" in the appearance of Akatriel as described in Berachot "is cursed before the God of Israel."'25 Geonim such as Hai and Sherira distanced themselves from the Shi'ur Qomah texts of the Hekhalot literature, questioning their attribution to (second-century) tannaitic Rabbis or claiming that their meaning was a "great mystery."''26 Other Geonim held a more moderate view, declaring God's ability to speak directly to man as described in the Hebrew Bible and various Midrashim, while claiming that all physical manifestations of the divine are carried out by angelic beings. So, the most influential thinker of the period, Saadia Gaon (882-942), based his theology on a doctrine of a created light, identified with the "Divine Glory."27 To this Glory are predicated all anthropomorphic statements about the divine. Although Saadia's known works do not include an inter- pretation of this passage concerning Akatriel, other prominent Geonim a century later, such as Hananel b. Hushiel (died 1056), understood Saa- dia's doctrine of the Glory to include Rabbi Ishmael's viewing of Akatriel: "Do you not see that because Rabbi Ishmael the high priest saw in the holy of holies the Glory, Akatriel, Lord of Hosts, seated on the exalted and high throne in the holy of holies, in the mind's eye [be-re'iyat ha-lev] Approaches to Judaism in Medieval Times, ed.

Although it is not clear from the immediate comment what aspect of the Aggadah he finds offensive, from the context of this chapter of his work and the book as a whole it becomes clear that it is the belief that God has a definite shape. See further, Alexander Altmann, "Moses Narboni's 'Epistle on Shi'ur Qoma': A Critical Edition of the Hebrew Text with an Introduction and an Annotated English Translation," in Jewish Medieval and Renaissance Studies, ed. A. Altmann (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1967), p. 228. 26 Sherira's response that it is a "great mystery" can also be viewed as an endorsement rather than a denial of these traditions. See Gershom Scholem, "Shi'ur Komah: The Mystical Shape of the Godhead," in his On the Mystical Shape of the Godhead, trans. J. Neugroschel (New York: Schocken, 1991), pp. 35-37.

And there are those who say Akatriel is an angel, but we have received [qibalnu] that he is no other than the [divine] Glory.'"29 Hananel adds two important changes to Saadia's view: he classi- fies the vision to be a vision "in the mind's eye" in order to deny the existence of a corporeal manifestation of God. Second, he adds to Aka- triel's appellation the term "Glory," apparently to strengthen his tradi- tion. Hananel therefore raises Akatriel's status from angel to divine Glory as he removes his manifestation from the physical world. The student and successor of Hananel, Nissim Gaon (990-1062), seems to return to Saadia's view of the divine Glory as an entity which physically manifests itself in the world. He cites the "few Aggadot [to which] the Sages commented that Akatriel is an angel, like Michael or Gabriel. And Ishmael saw an angel but the voice he heard spoke the words of God, may He be blessed."30 Further, in the first third of the twelfth century, Rabbi Yehuda Barzeloni writes: And so every prophet and seer who sees this luminous light says "I have seen God". And when the prophet says he "sees God": he means to say "I have seen signs from God which demonstrate [the presence] of His Glory", according to [what Saadia] explained [regarding] this whole matter in a full commentary in the Book of Unity.3' According to this correct view, we are obliged to say that Rabbi Ishmael saw one form [zurah] of the forms of luminous light which were created first. And the name of this [particular] light is Akatriel, and it is called the God of Israel, that is a sign of the Lord of Israel.32 Barzeloni has therefore placed Akatriel within Saadia's understanding of the Glory, viewed as one of its forms. Further on, Barzeloni characterizes 28 Literally, "before." 29 David Metzger, ed., Perushei Rabenu Hananel bar Hushiel La-Talmud (Jerusalem: Machon Lev Sameah, 1990), 1:12-13; Otzar ha-Geonim, ed. B.

Certain manuscripts which describe the emanated Special Cherub sitting on the divine throne are attributed to Eleazar of Worms, the main figure of the pietist circle at the beginning of the thirteenth century. Scho- lem was misled by these attributions and attempted to give a harmonized reading of both corpora.36 Later studies by Joseph Dan corrected this impression and outlined new demarcations for the two bodies of litera- ture.37 We can now see that the pietists avoid a literal reading of man's seeing God. On the whole, Eleazar of Worms tends to follow Hananel, that Rabbi Ishmael viewed Akatriel in the "mind's eye," that is, in a con- templative vision. So, for example, he writes in his Commentary to the Prayers: So Akatriel appeared to Rabbi Ishmael, the high priest,3s as if he prays, [saying the words:] "May it be My will before Me that my mercy will overcome My [other] attributes". In this same way, [he appeared] to Moses, "And God passed before his face and called ... ,that he was wrapped [in a prayer shawl], like the represen- 11 Compare Otzar ha-Geonim, p. 18. 14 The same view can be found in Salomon Parchon's Lexicon Hebraicum (Pusonii: Antonii Nobilis de Schmid, 1844), pt. 2, fol. 38d (in Hebrew): "He is called an angel, that is, the angel Lord of Hosts told him thus [one] prays before me, and he says 'Blessed are you Lord,' in order to teach to the blessings to the children of Israel." 35 Barzaloni, pp. 20-21. 36 See, e.g., Scholem, Major Trends (n. 17 above), pp. 110-16. 37 See Joseph Dan, "'The Exceptional Cherub' Sect in the Literature of the Medieval German Hasidim," Tarbiz 35 (1966): 345-72 (in Hebrew), reprinted in his Studies in Ashkenazi-Hasidic Literature (Ramat Gan: Masadah, 1975), pp. 89-111 (in Hebrew); and see my forthcoming study, "The Evolution of Intention of Prayer to the "Special Cherub": From the Earliest Works to a Late Unknown Treatise," Frankfurter Judaistische Beitrdge, vol. 22 (1995). 38 Only in the Hekhalot version is Elisha termed high priest. 52</page><page sequence="11">The Career of Akatriel tative of the congregation.39 [This does] not [mean] that He [really] prays, rather that he shows them how to pray, because through his Glory he displays the will of the Creator, may He be Blessed, as through a looking glass.40 Eleazar has equated Akatriel with the divine Glory which is itself per- ceived in a visionary state. Moreover, Eleazar is not willing to accept the plain sense of the aggadah that Akatriel prays and instead characterizes Akatriel as a symbolic mode of representation. A sharper formulation of this passage can be found in another work of his where he calls Rabbi Ishmael's viewing of Akatriel "a contemplative vision which is called such [i.e., by the name Akatriel]."4 Akatriel is therefore the name of the vision of the anthropomorphic manifestation of the divine or His Glory.42 Another text, attributed to figures two generations prior to Eleazar, indeed shows some affinity to the doctrine of the Special Cherub. In a passage printed by the collector and printer Shlomo Mussayef at the be- ginning of this century from a manuscript now housed in the Jewish Na- tional and University Library (Jerusalem), Saadia's doctrine of the "Cre- ated Glory" is understood to contain two "Glories," one transcendent and one enthroned: And on top, upon this semblance of a throne, there was the semblance of (Ez. 1:26) two images, as it says in [Saadia's] Book of Beliefs [and Opinions] there are two "Glories" above in the heavens, one on the throne and another above [it]. And this is the meaning of two glories. And the Shekhina which is seen on the throne appears to be very fine. And all that they [the prophets] saw was not the appearance of the Creator, may He be blessed, but [the appearance] of a created human [form] which is seated on the throne of the Holy One blessed be He, and 19 Babylonian Talmud, Rosh ha-Shana. 40 Eleazar of Worms, Perushei Siddur ha-Tefila la-Roqeah, ed.

This text was published in part by Joseph Dan, Sifrut ha-Yihud shel Haside Ashekanz, in his Studies in Ashkenazi-Hasidic Literature, p. 81, and will appear in a fuller edition taken from new manuscripts in my study "Fragments of Sefer Shakod" (n. 29 above). 53</page><page sequence="12">The Journal of Religion He showed him this form [demut], [whose measure] is the numerical equivalent of 236 million parsangs, and so is the measure of he who sits on the throne. And this was received from R. Yehudah Hasid and from Yoel Hasid and from his brother R. Qalonimos Hasid.43 This tradition portrays a split between the transcendent deity and the human shape of the Shi'ur Qomah as described in the Hekhalot literature. The split seems to account for any difficulties with the vision of God and stands in sharp contrast to the view of Eleazar of Worms. We can further view this text as a harmonization of the opposing tendencies found in the Geonic writings. The integration of a transcendent and manifest form of God is best articulated by the theology of the Special Cherub. In these works, an emanated (or created) angelic form sits on the throne while God's tran- scendent aspect remains above. The earliest writing to survive which fol- lows the doctrine of the Special Cherub is apparently the Pesaq ha-Yirah. This work inverts the standard imagery of the Glory as a lower or physical manifestation of God and describes the Glory as transcendent and the Cherub as the enthroned and visible aspect. The latter is also termed Kingdom and Greatness, and the former, Holiness. In a brief passage, the author describes this two-part theosophy with the additional names of two angelic figures: "And it is found in Sefer Hekhalot: Yah Akatriel is His Greatness, Hadariel, Lord of Israel, is his Holiness, [and] Adiriron is his Power."44 Although it is clear that Akatriel, as His Greatness, is identified with the Cherub, Adiriron's function is not explained in this work. A later work written according to this theology, the Berayta of Yosefben Uziel, offers the following interpretation: "And the holy Cherub has two names: Aka- triel, and he is sealed [with the second name] Adiriron when his Shekhina rests upon him."45 It would appear that the Berayta has preserved an older tradition which was hinted at already in the Pesaq where Akatriel is 43S.

This higher aspect expresses the Cherub's connection to the Shekhina and the lower aspect, Adiriron, expresses the Cherub's manifest quality.46 THE EARLY KABBALAH Akatriel does not hold a central place in early Kabbalistic symbolism. Al- though many Kabbalists commented on Rabbinic aggadot, including the description of Akatriel, their main interest was to explain the role of an- thropomorphic manifestations in their system of thought. To this end, Metatron served their purposes far better and replaced Akatriel even in discussions concerning the relevant pages from Berachot. In the following discussion of the early Kabbalah it will be shown that the supplanting of Akatriel in the context of Berachot by the earliest known Kabbalistic figure caused another early Kabbalist to comment on Akatriel's absence. This comment was misread by modern scholarship and through a reinvestiga- tion will be shown to shed light on Akatriel's role in early Kabbalistic theosophy. The early thirteenth-century provengal Kabbalist, Asher ben David, quoted the comment of his grandfather, Rabbi Abraham ben David of Posquiers (Rabad), one of the earliest known Kabbalistic personalities. In this passage, the talmudic reference to God's phylactaries is said to "refer to the Prince of the [divine] countenance [i.e., to Metatron], whose name is like the name of his Master." This passage was discussed by Scholem to demonstrate the logos doctrine off the early Kabbalah, comparing it to the Kabbalistic understanding of the last sefirah as in the Book Bahir, to the parallel doctrine of the Special Cherub texts,47 and to various texts of members of ancient Jewish sects from "the Orient." Scholem was there- fore trying to place the mystical thought of Rabad within a common pool of medieval symbolism which is collectively identified by him as the early 46 See further Sefer Ha-Temunah (Lemberg: Isak Eckhus, 1892), fols. 17b-18a, 52a, which develops this idea according to the doctrine of the sefirot. 47 See Abrams, "The Boundaries of Divine Ontology" (n. 8 above), and "New Manuscripts to the 'Book of Secrets' Compiled by R. Shem Tov bar Simha and the Sources He Pos- sessed," Asufot 10 (1996, in press) (in Hebrew), where I discuss a tradition attributed to "the Rabbi," namely Nahmanides, in which Metatron is conceived of as a type of logos. See, however, Gershom Scholem, Origins of the Kabbalah, ed. R. J. Zwi Werblowsky, trans. Allan Arkush (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1987), pp. 298-99, where he understands "the Rabbi" to be Isaac the Blind apparently due to the juxtaposition of this tradition in the manuscript to that of his students' works. The misreading known to Scholem and found in many texts was first cited by M. Steinschnieder, "Literarische Beilage: Zur Kabbalistischen Literatur," Hebrdiische Bibliographie 10 (1870): 156-61, esp. 161. On the logos in the Special Cherub texts, see my study "The Evolution of Intention of Prayer to the 'Special Cherub'" (n. 37 above). Of note is the early comment by Odeberg where he notes that Akatriel is compared to the Special Cherub in the Beryata of Yosef ben Uziel. See Odeberg (n. 20 above), p. 42 of the English translation, n. 4. 55</page><page sequence="14">The Journal of Religion Kabbalah, based in Provence but displaying various contemporary off- shoots. Moreover, by comparing this idea to ancient texts, Scholem was trying to flush out, in yet another example, the reemergence of ancient (and gnostic) sources in a medieval, rabbinic setting.48 The basic distinction made by Rabad is that Metatron (and not Akatriel who is mentioned by name in the continuation of the text of the Talmud) is the visible anthropomorphic form "who appeared to Moses and which appeared to Ezekiel," while "the Cause of Causes did not appear to any man." This text, attributed to Rabad, can therefore be seen as the first Kabbalistic text which seeks to supplant Akatriel with Metatron as the physical manifestation of the divine. In a manuscript recently made available to the scholarly community and from which Moshe Soave first published these passages attributed to Rabad over a century ago,49 the middle sentence of the tradition is brack- eted on either end with the word haga'ha, denoting the insertion of an editorial comment by another: In tractate Berachot50sthe words of my grandfather R. Abraham b. David-[it says:] "Whence do we know that the Holy One, blessed be He, puts on Phylacta- ries?" This refers to the Prince of the Countenance whose name is like his master.5' A gloss: "But perhaps there is one above him who emanated from the highest cause, and in whom there is supreme power." End of gloss.52 And it is He who appeared to Moses at the [burning] bush and He who appeared to Ezekiel in the vision of the man above (Ez. 1:26). But the Cause of Causes [did not appear, not] right nor left, front nor back53 [can be predicated to it]. And this is the secret of the Account of the Creation: "whoever knows the measure of the creator of the beginning [yozer bereshit] is assured a place in the world to come". And this is what is written [Gen. 1:26], "Let us make man in our image."54 48 In his study, Rabad of Posquiers: A Twelfth-Century Talmudist (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1962), pp. 286-300, Isadore Twersky interprets in a less mystical way the texts Scholem discussed which were written by and attributed to Rabad. 49 Moshe Soave, "The Fourth Rabad," in Ozar Nechmad, 4 vols.

I am currently preparing for publication the works of R. Asher ben David based on this manuscript. 50 On whether Rabad wrote a commentary to all of Talmud, see S. Z. Havlin, ed., History of the Oral Law and of Early Rabbinic Scholarship by Menahem ha-Meiri (Jerusalem and Cleve- land: Ofeq, 1992), p. 132 and notes cited there (in Hebrew); Gershom Scholem, "A New Document for the History of the Beginning of the Kabbalah," in Sefer Bialik, ed.

Moscow, Gtinzburg 321, fol. 87b. Compare to Scholem's translation, Origins, p. 212. 56</page><page sequence="15">The Career of Akatriel Ignoring the version printed from this manuscript, Scholem presented the comment without the words "gloss" and "end of gloss" and discussed this comment in the context of the full passage as if it too came from the hand of Rabad.55 Scholem thereby secured a more theosophic (i.e., sefirotic) reading of the passage in the vein of later Kabbalists. Accord- ingly, Metatron is understood to be one of various emanated forces, the phrase "one above him" referring to a separate power positioned be- tween "His Master," the Cause of Causes, and Metatron. The bracketed comment can only be viewed as the later addition of another, the opposite development being highly implausible. It stands to reason that a relatively early Kabbalistic figure, made his comment in the margin. A later copyist then inserted the comment into the body of the text as if it were placed in the margin as to complete the existing text. A second and more careful copyist also viewed the manuscript with the gloss in the margin and inserted the comment into the body of the text, marking it on either end as a gloss. Two families of manuscripts there- fore arose.56 The integrated comment circulated in most manuscripts and influ- enced various Kabbalistic figures. The author of the gloss was apparently bothered by the exclusion of Akatriel, and in viewing the angelic names as referents of the emanated divine sefirot, he sought to place Akatriel above Metatron. Rabad's original intent was to describe a transcendent deity who relates to the world through the agency of angelic beings, a doctrine found in Rabbinic literature. Moreover, having established the true nature of the comment of the Rabad, it can be shown that a second 55 See esp. the Hebrew text in Gershom Scholem, Reshit ha-Qabbalah (Jerusalem and Tel Aviv: Schocken, 1948), pp. 75-76. Note that Scholem's Hebrew text also includes the word "emanated," which is lacking in the Moscow manuscript and Geiger's transcription. While this word is present in the version found in a Ms. London, British Library, 768, the incipit differs as well. Scholem's version does appear, however, in Sefer Ma'arekhet Ha-Elohut (Fer- rara: n.p., 1558), fols. 212b-213a, and Mantua 1558, fol. 157a. See now as well the collecta- nea found in Ms. Manschester, Gaster Add. 11, fol. 21a. Might Scholem have relied (in part) on the printed version of Sefer Ma'arekhet Ha-Elohut without referring to it? See Origins, p. 299, n. 198; H. Graetz, Geschichte derJuden (Leipzig: Leiner, n.d.), p. 387. 56 See Ms. Parma 68 (2704), fol. 18a, where the comment is copied independently without these markings. See further the collectanea in Ms. London, British Library 768, fol. 107a, published by G. Margoliouth, Catalogue of the Hebrew and Samaritan Manuscripts in the British Museum (London: William Clowes &amp; Sons, 1915), 3:75. I was unable to locate this passage in the parallel manuscript of Ms. Oxford 1956. See, however, Ms. Oxford, fols. 18b-19a: "Behold I send an angel before you, this speaks of the angel of the countenance whose name is like his Master, as it is written (Ex. 23:21) 'For My name is in him.'

This work is cited once again there on fol. 64b. On the interpolation of glosses in Kabbalistic manuscripts, see the final pages of Abrams, "Fragments of Sefer Shakod" (n. 29 above), as well as Daniel Abrams, The Book Bahir (Los Angeles: Cherub Press, 1994), chap. 1, esp. pp. 40-41 (in Hebrew). 57</page><page sequence="16">The Journal of Religion comment, recorded in the name of Rabad by Ya'akov Ibn Habib in his Ein Ya'akob, is a further reworking of the above text with its addition. I will cite this version in full since Scholem only presented a short ex- cerpt:57 "And I found written in the name of Rabad, may his memory be blessed, on the commentary of'it was not delivered by means of a messen- ger', a messenger [refers] to the prince of the world who appeared to the prophets, who reigns over the Merkabah; [he] is emanated from the highest cause, and in whom there is the power of the supreme. And it is of him that the verse [Gen. 1:26] 'Let us make man in our image' speaks."'58 Here the gloss is retained, but the reference to the additional power has been omitted. Two suggestions can be offered to explain the addition of the gloss. First, it can be suggested that the gloss was added to account for the absence of Akatriel in Rabad's remarks and apply his interpretation to the discussion in the Talmud. Second, the later author might also have had difficulty with a two-part theosophy based upon the most distant Cause of Causes and the visible angelic form. According to the author of the gloss, it is necessary to bridge the gap between the two with a high but defined power. This idea can be found in various formulations in the theosophic systems of alter Kabbalists. So, for example, many thirteenth-century Kabbalists discussed the relationship between the highest aspects of the theosophic structure of the divine sefirot, Ein Sof and Keter or even Keter and Hokhma.59 7 For a further tradition (spuriously) cited in the name of Rabad, see Twersky, p. 287, n. 3. 58 Ya'akov Ibn Habib, Ein Ya'akob (Vilna: Widows &amp; Brothers Ram, 1894), Ta'anith, fol. 40b. See Scholem, Origins (n. 47 above), p. 215, n. 26. Compare again to the earlier source translated by Scholem, Origins, p. 212. 59 In a recent study Charles Mopsik has provided an integrated reading of the above two comments attributed to Rabad and further harmonized them with his celebrated comment regarding the dual, sexualized nature of the first man and the attributes of God. In light of the above conclusions, Mopsik has nevertheless correctly analyzed the reception of these texts by later Kabbalists. See his study, "Genese 1:26-27 l'image de Dieu, le couple humain et le statut de la femme chez les premiers cabalistes," in Rigueur et passion: Melanges offerts en hommage a' Annie Kriegel, ed. Stephane Courtois, Marc Lazar, and Shmuel Trigano (Paris: Cerf, 1994), pp. 341-61, esp. pp. 345-49. Mopsik has also recasted the famous gloss of Rabad to Maimonides' Code (Teshuva, chap. 3, par. 7; critical edition, B. Naor, ed. Hasagot Ha-Rabad la-Mishne Torah [Jerusalem: Zohar, 1984], pp. 42-43), where he says that "people greater than and better to him" believed in anthropomorphism, which Maimonides termed heretical. Mopsik showed (p. 345) that the continuation of the comment-cited by Twersky (n. 48 above, pp. 282-83), but not by Scholem (in Origins, p. 211)-points to a criticism of the plain sense of Scripture and certain aggadot and not a blanket vindication of anthropo- morphism. See further Warren Zev Harvey, "The Incorporeality of God in Maimonides, Rabad and Spinoza," in Studies in Jewish Thought, ed. S. Heller Willensky and M. Idel (Jeru- salem: Magnes Press, 1989), pp. 72-73 (in Hebrew). Harvey argues that Rabad's critique was aimed at certain philosophers, i.e., that these aggadic texts which contain anthropo- morphisms "corrupt" philosophic principles. See alternatively J. Gellman, "The Philosophi- cal Hassagot of Rabad on Maimonides' Mishne Torah," New Scholasticism 52 (1984): 145-69, esp. 153-55. 58</page><page sequence="17">The Career of Akatriel In a later discussion, Scholem read Rabad's text through the lenses of the Hekhalot literature, among other sources.60 For Scholem, just as the Hekhalot literature terms Metatron the lesseryah (based on the tetragram- maton) to distinguish him from God, here, Rabad (i.e., the author of the gloss), emphasizes that "there is one above him," to indicate that Meta- tron is not God. Scholem therefore finds only two powers described in the passage, not three.61' Before turning to the interpretations of Akatriel and the passage from Berachot in the classical Kabbalah of the thirteenth century, it should be noted that Kabbalists in the generations prior to the Spanish expulsion received the integrated text alone. The fourteenth-century author of Sefer Ma'arekhet Ha-Elohut admitted that he "at first did not understand what [Rabad] meant because his words seemed to contradict our own. And afterwards, I [studied it more] carefully, and he who knows about prophetic vision, what I have mentioned [earlier] in this chapter, will un- derstand our words. And [its meaning] is very deep and true." To this passage Judah he-Hayyat commented at the end of the fifteenth century: It is the view of the Rabbi [Rabad] that "the Prince of the Countenance who is Enoch [is] Metatron who is called by the name of his Master", this refers to the Holy One blessed be He according to what is said in this aggadah. And this is what is meant by "he who wears [phylactaries]", and according to his view, the phylactaries refer to the four camps of the Shekhina that are above him. [And the words of Rabad that,] "Perhaps there is another62 above him .. ." agree with what I received, that there is a great Metatron and a lesser Metatron just as with the emanation of the large face [apei ravrevei] and the small face [apei zutrei]. And the large one is the body of the Shekhina63 which is emanated from it and following this, the Shekhina is called Metatron. And the second [Metatron] below it is the heaven beneath the four camps of the Shekhina which is above the heads of 60 Gershom Scholem, The Kabbalah of Provence: The Circle of Rabad and his Son Isaac the Blind (The Lectures of Gershom Scholem Presented in 1963), ed. R. Schatz (Jerusalem: Akademon, 1976), p. 98 (in Hebrew). There Scholem claims that Asher ben David is citing Rabad's lost commentary to Berachot (and not an independent comment). 61 Ibid., p. 99. See further Moshe Idel's study on the Kabbalah in Provence, where he casts traditions recorded in the name of Rabad against an Ashkenazi background of a binary theosophy with respect to prayer. See M. Idel, "Prayer in Provengal Kabbalah," Tarbiz 62 (1993): 265-86, esp. 268 (in Hebrew). 62 Both the Ferrara and Mantua editions (1558) read "another" (aher) instead of "one" (ehad ). 63 See Moshe Idel, "The World of Angels in Human Form," in Studies in Jewish Mysticism, Philosophy and Ethical Literature Presented to Isaiah Tishby on His Seventy-Fifth Birthday, ed. Joseph Dan and Joseph Hacker (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1986), p. 32 (in Hebrew). Idel describes a view found in the Book of Contemplation where there are two groups of angels in the form of man. The first is composed of eight angels and the second of the four camps of the Shekhina. The first is termed demut ha-Shekhina or guf ha-shekhina, the image or body of the Shekhina. 59</page><page sequence="18">The Journal of Religion the beasts [of Ezekiel's chariot] which are the chariot of the secondary chariot of the Shekhina and the first chariot to the created Metatron.64 This passage displays the crystallization of Kabbalistic symbolism. Even when the author clearly understands Metatron to be a sefirah and yet needs to explain the presence of an additional angelic figure, he does not resort to Akatriel who is described in the talmudic passage. Rather, Judah he-Hayyat employs an older tradition which describes two "Metatrons," an angelic Metatron and a sefirotic one. Akatriel therefore has been all but excised from the force of the talmudic passage and supplanted by an extended mythologoumena concerning Metatron. The process by which Akatriel was identified and later replaced by Metatron can be traced through the writings of the thirteenth-century Kabbalah. CLASSICAL THEOSOPHIC KABBALAH One of the first known Kabbalists in Spain, Ezra of Gerona composed a Kabbalistic commentary to the aggadot which remains in manuscript. In his discussion to the aggadic passage concerning Akatriel found in Bera- chot he writes: "We have received [a tradition] that this name is called 'guardian of Israel'. And wherever one finds the matter of the 'guardian' [written] in Scripture, know that it refers to the angel of the Glory [malakh ha-Kavod ] which is called in Rabbinic terminology65 Shekhina and Attribute ofJudgment."66 Ezra has here understood Akatriel to be the tenth sefirah.67 He has therefore collapsed various symbolic systems into a unified pic- ture of the sefirotic map of the divine world. Among the systems which can easily be identified are Rabbinic literature and possibly German Pi- etism. This commentary was reworked by his younger contemporary, Az- riel, who apparently added the term Cherub to this list of appelations, displaying a familiarity with the works of the Special Cherub circle.68 A generation later, Todros Abulafia cited this passage of Geronese Kab- 64 Hayyat's Commentary to Sefer Ma'arekhet Ha-Elohut (Ferrara, 1558), fol. 212b; (Mantua, 1558), fol. 157a; and copied as well in the Kabbalistic collectanea, Yalkut Re'uveni (Warsaw: Brothers Levine-Epstein, 1802), fol. 21a. See Altmann, "Moses Narboni" (n. 25 above), p. 238.

And [it] is therefore called by this name, that is crown [keter], which is the diadem ['atarah]. And there are those who say Katriel. And I have received that his name is such, and so I have seen written in some of the words of some of the Kabbalists which are hidden and sealed, locked away, that it is [called] the guardian of Is- rael. .... And if we say that his name is Akatriel, [then] also the [letter] aleph refers to the Ein Sof That is [it consists of] Aleph [and] Katriel.69 Todros seems to be incorporating an earlier and contradicting tradition, wherein Akatriel is placed at the top of the divine structure with that of Azriel, which identifies Akatriel as the last sefirah.70 He is able to blend the two by parsing the name Akatriel and interpreting the first letter, aleph, as the referent of the first sefirah and providing a synonym for the second half of the word, Keter, that is, 'Atarah, a term which refers to the tenth sefirah. Akatriel therefore symbolizes the entire emanative and theurgic act which is operated through prayer. As he explains in the sentences which follow the above: "And regarding what is said [in Berachot 7a], "Bless me," the [word] blessing is derived from the supernal blessing7' which blesses and extends the good and supernal [efflux] from the top and until the bottom." LATER REACTIONS Although the developing symbolism of the early Kabbalah was inclined to absorb unique "angelic" figures such as Metatron and Akatriel into its hierarchy of ten sefirotic powers," some later Kabbalists who had a far more developed theosophic system were freer to examine the aggadic description on its own terms.

Oron, ed., Sha'ar Ha-Razim of Todros ben Joseph Abulafia (Jerusalem: Mosad Bialik, 1989), p. 150. Both sources are cited already by Tishby. Ibn Ziah, Zror ha-Hayyim, which is based on Ozar Ha-Kavod (Ms. London-Montefore, 318, fol. 57b-58a), adds little to Todros's com- ments. See also Meir Ibn Gabbai, Avodat Ha-Qodesh, pt. 1, chap. 16, which discusses this passage, as well as Moshe of Kiev's Shushan Sodot (Koretz: Jahn Anton Krieger, 1788), fol. 52b. The latter emphasizes that, of the two divine grades, Keter and Atarah, which are the two possible interpretations of the text, Rabbi Ishmael must have viewed the lower, for otherwise his prophetic vision would be ranked higher than that of Moses. 70 For the identification of Akatriel with the sefirah Keter, see Shem Tov ben Shem Tov's Sefer Ha-Emunot (Ferrara, 1556), fol. 39a, and the text published in Sefer Ma'or va-Shemesh (Livorno: Eliezer Menahem Ottolenghi, 1739), fol. 13a. 71 Understood also as the third sefirah, Binah. 72 D. Abrams, "The Shekhina Prays before God" (n. 43 above). 61</page><page sequence="20">The Journal of Religion Solomon Ibn Adret (Rashba), understood Akatriel as "the name of God.""73 Along these lines, in Isaac of Acre's Ozar Ha-Hayyim we find the blessing addressed to Akatriel, Lord of Hosts, requesting of him that he instruct his angels to answer certain prayers.74 Most striking is the com- ment of the fifteenth-century author of Menorat ha-Me'or, Israel Ibn Al- Nakawa. He cites the text of Berachot as follows: "Rabbi Ishmael said: 'One time I was offering a sacrifice on the altar when I saw the Creator(!) [ha-bore], who was sitting on a high and exalted throne.''75 The identification of Akatriel with the simple deity, "God," appears in texts composed after the classical period of the theosophic Kabbalah in which elaborate descriptions of the relationships between the sefirot and handbooks listing their various appellations were written. Possessing these well-defined symbolic systems, these figures were not compelled to read this passage with sefirotic referents in mind. By the sixteenth cen- tury, the reknowned Kabbalist, Moses Cordovero, was bothered by the apparent identification of God with Akatriel in the passage from Berachot: Said Rabbi Ishmael b. Elisha, "I saw Akatriel Yah, Lord of Hosts". He is the one who receives the prayers and is not [to be identified with] the glorious King, for if so he would not have said "I actually saw [him]". God forbid! And it is known that Akatriel is the prince in heaven and is not God ['eloha]. And why is it that it says Ya Lord of Hosts? Because the angels are called according to the name of the masters, according to the name which hovers above them and enclothes them, which is the Shekhina. And so in the case of Akatriel, which when [seated] on the adorned Glory says Ya, Lord of Hosts.76 Although Cordovero is not compelled to identify Akatriel with a certain sefirah, he is insistent that Akatriel is an angel and not God, apparently responding to statements which directly make this association. Cordov- ero's statement therefore shows the opposite of the phenomenon de- scribed above: instead of being defined with God himself, Cordovero dis- tances Akatriel from any aspect of the Godhead. Cordovero's comments brings us full circle in the understanding of Akatriel's appropriation by various figures throughout the history ofJew- ish literature and Jewish mysticism in particular.
