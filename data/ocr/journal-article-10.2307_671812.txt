<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ritual, Sanctity, and Cybernetics' ROY A. RAPPAPORT University of Michigan The role of the sacred in human communication and in the regulation of social and ecological systems is approached through ritual. After a brief review of salient features of Maring ethnography, formal characteristics of rituals making them suitable for communication and regulation functions are examined. From this discussion a concept of sanctity relating it to a problem inherent in symbolic communication is derived. The non-discussive basis of sanctity is then considered and the role of the sacred in the cybernetics of social and ecological systems is then discussed. Next it is suggested that the relationship between sanctity and authority changes with technological development. Finally, some tentative suggestions con- cerning the origins of the sacred are advanced. I THE ROLES that ritual and sanctity play in communication, and in the regulation of the systems in which they participate are examined in this essay in an attempt to gain some additional understanding of the nature of religion. This essay differs from an earlier study I made of Tsembaga ritual (Rappaport 1967, 1968) in important ways. Whereas the earlier analysis focused upon the functions of ritual in a complex ecological system, the present attempts to elucidate those formal character- istics of Tsembaga ritual and belief -and through them, if possible, ritual and belief in general--which make them suitable to fulfill the functions the earlier analysis ascribed to them. Thus, although the arguments that I advance may have some generality, I shall have to allude to Tsembaga ethnography, and incorporate some of the earlier analysis. I ask the forbearance of those familiar with the earlier work, but promise to carry the discussion further. Moreover, coherence demands that some of the analysis published in the last chapter of Pigs for the Ancestors be incorporated into the present study. It will be well, before proceeding, to make clear my use of such terms as "system," "regulate," and "control." I shall then review briefly some salient features of Maring ethnology and then discuss the formal characteristics of ritual that suit them for communication and regulatory func- tions. The discussion of ritual will lead to suggestions concerning the nature of sanctity and its role in communication and control. II I do not use the term "system" to desig- nate collections of entities which share some ontological characteristic, as might be implied by such phrases as "belief system," or "kinship terminological system." The term "system" is meant merely to designate a collection of specified variables in which a change in the value or state of any one will result in a change in the value or state of at least one of the others. The ontological char- acteristics of the components of the physical world from which the variables are derived are irrelevant; we may include in the com- pass of a single system or subsystem variables abstracted from cultural, biological, and inorganic phenomena. I use the terms "regulate" and "control" in a systemic, indeed a cybernetic, sense. A regulating mechanism, control mechanism or homeostat is one that maintains the values of one or more of the variables included in a system within a range or ranges that defines the continued existence of the system. Such ranges of viability may often be established empirically. Population size serves as a 59</page><page sequence="2">60 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [73, 1971 familiar example. We may be able to demon- strate, or at least have good reason for be- lieving, that below a certain size a particular population will be too small to reproduce or defend itself, above a particular size it will destroy its subsistence base. The viable range, i.e., the set of possible states between these limits, is sometimes called the "goal range." Regulation is the process which maintains the value of the variable within the goal range, usually through negative feed-back. A familiar example from the universe of machines is the operation of the thermostat. The terms "regulation" and "control" refer to operations which are central to "adaptation." Adaptation here refers to the processes by which organisms or groups of organisms, through responsive changes in their own states, structures, or compositions, maintain homeostasis in and among them- selves in the face of both short term environ- ment fluctuations and long term changes in the composition or structure of their environments. III We may now turn to the Tsembaga, one of about twenty politically autonomous local territorial groups of Maring speaking people living on the northern fall of the Bismarck Range in the Australian Trust Terri- tory of New Guinea. They number about 200 people and their territory encompasses about three square miles of mountainside. The Tsembaga participate in two distinct systems. First, they are a population in the ecological sense, that is, one of the com- ponents in a system of inter-species trophic (or feeding) exchanges occurring within a bounded area, Tsembaga territory. Converse- ly, Tsembaga territory and the biota in- habiting it (including the Tsembaga) consti- tute an ecosystem. The Tsembaga participate in exchanges of women, valuables, and trade goods with other similar local groups occupying areas external to their territory. Another char- acteristic of relations between adjacent terri- torial groups is warfare, one of the processes by which land is redistributed among local groups and people redispersed over land. Thus, as the Tsembaga are participants in an ecosystem, a system of localized inter- species exchanges, so are they participants in a regional system, a system of non-localized in tra-species exchanges. Of course events in the local system affect events in the regional system and vice versa. Therefore these two systems are not separate systems but subsystems of a larger system which they together comprise. I have argued elsewhere (1967, 1968) that rituals, arranged in protracted cycles (up to twenty years), articulate the local and regional sys- tems, and, furthermore, regulate relations within each of the subsystems and in the larger systems as a whole. To be more specific, I have interpreted the ritual cycles of the Tsembaga and other Maring as regu- lating mechanisms and have argued that their operation helps to maintain an undegraded biotic environment, limits fighting to fre- quencies which do not endanger the survival of the regional population, adjusts man/land ratios, facilitates trade, distributes local sur- pluses of pig throughout the regional population in the form of pork and assures to members of the local group rations of high quality protein. We may begin an outline of the operation of the ritual cycle with the termination of warfare. Principal antagonists invariably are local groups, such as Tsembaga. Un- less it has been driven off its land, when hostilities have ceased a local group ritually plants a shrub called rumbim at a traditional place. This act, symbolizing the connection of the group to its territory, is accompanied by a massive slaughter of pigs. Only juveniles survive; the rest are offered to the ancestors in reciprocation for their assistance in the fighting. But this sacrifice is not believed by the actors to discharge their debt to their deceased forebears, and the latter are told that when there are sufficient pigs a larger offering will be made to them. While they</page><page sequence="3">Rappaport ] RITUAL, SANCTITY AND CYBERNETICS 61 remain in debt to their ancestors the living cannot initiate new hostilities, for it is be- lieved that martial success is impossible with- out the assistance of ancestors and that the assistance of the ancestors will not be forth- coming until they are repaid in pigs for their help in the last fight. A "truce of God" thus prevails until there are sufficient pigs to ab- solve the living of their debt to the dead. Thus, the number of pigs regarded as suf- ficient to repay the ancestors and the length of time it takes to acquire them are crucial factors in regulating the frequency of war- fare. Outside of the rituals associated with war- fare and festivals, the slaughter and con- sumption of pigs is largely limited to the rituals associated with illness and injury. These are occasions in which it is likely that the affected organisms are experiencing physiological stress, and I have argued (Rap- paport 1965:84ff) that reserving the limited amount of domestic pork available for con- sumption during stressful periods is highly functional for the Maring. Be this as it may, the amount of time required to accumulate sufficient pigs is obviously related to the success and well-being of the pigs' masters, since the slaughter of the beasts is associated with human misfortune. But, rapidly or slow- ly, the pig population does expand and sooner or later the pigs' ration of sub- standard sweet potatoes incidentally ob- tained in the course of harvesting for humans becomes insufficient, and additional acreage needs to be put into production especially for the pigs. The increment may be sub- stantial. When the Tsembaga herd was at maximum in 1963, 36 percent of the acreage in production was devoted to the support of 170 pigs. The burden of the increased gar- dening falls upon women, and their com- plaints of overwork become increasingly strident as the number of animals in their charge increases. At the same time, garden invasions by pigs become more frequent and often lead to serious disputes. When the complaints of the women and the garden invasions become intolerable to a sufficient number of men to dominate the consensus there are sufficient pigs to repay the ances- tors. To put this in ecological terms, there are sufficient pigs to repay the ancestors when the relationship of pigs to humans changes from one of mutualism to one of parasitism or competition. Empirical investi- gations indicate that this point lies below the carrying capacity of the territory for pigs. (Rappaport 1968:93ff, 162ff, 295ff). When the herd reaches such a size (170 in 1962-1963), the rumbim is ritually uprooted and a year-long festival is staged, during which friendly groups are entertained from time to time and during which there are massive pig sacrifices which reduce the herd to tolerable size. This pork is then distri- buted to former allies. At the termination of its festival, a local group has fulfilled its obligations to ancestors (and allies) and is again free to open hostilities. The initiation of warfare is thus limited to once per ritual cycle. The ritual cycle thus operates as a homeostat in the local subsystem by keep- ing such variables as the size of the pig population, women's labor, lengths of fallow periods, and other variables within viable ranges; it operates as a homeostat in the regional susbystem by regulating the fre- quency of warfare, while periodically allow- ing the expansion of more ecologically com- petent groups at the expense of those less competent. It further operates as a trans- ducer-a device which transmits energy or information from one subsystem into another-for it articulates the local system to the regional system. Our argument concerning sanctity demands that we examine more closely one aspect of the year-long festival, the enter- tainment of visiting groups. The Tsembaga entertained visiting groups on thirteen differ- ent occasions during their festival in 1962-1963. These occasions resemble in im- portant ways events which seem to occur among a wide range of non-human animals. First, they include massed epigamic, or courtship, displays (Wynne-Edwards 1962:17). Men dance in formations before</page><page sequence="4">62 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [ 73, 1971 the young women who are thereby acquaint- ed with eligible males of local groups other- wise unfamiliar to them. The context also permits the young women to discriminate among this sample in terms of both endur- ance (signaled by how vigorously and how long a man dances) and wealth (signaled by the richness of a man's shell and feather finery). More importantly, such massed dancing communicates information to the partici- pants concerning the size of the groups. In many species of birds and insects such dis- plays take place as a prelude to actions which adjust size or density (Wynne- Edwards 1962:16). Such is also the case among the Maring. The massed dancing of the visitors at a kaiko entertainment com- municates to the hosts, while the rumbim truce is still in effect, information concern- ing the amount of support they may expect from the visitors in the aggression that they may embark upon following the termination of the pig festival. There are no chiefs or other political authorities capable of commanding the sup- port of a body of followers among the Maring, and whether or not to assist another group in warfare is a decision resting with each individual male. Allies are not recruited by appealing for help to other local groups as such. When a group is in need of military assistance, each of its members appeals to his cognatic and affinal kinsmen in other local groups. These kinsmen, in turn, urge other of their co-residents and kinsmen to "help them fight." The channels through which invitations to dance are extended are pre- cisely those through which appeals for military support are issued. Dance invita- tions are not extended by one group to another, but from one kinsman to another. Those invited then urge their co-residents to "help them dance." Dancing and fighting are regarded as in some sense equivalent. This equivalence is expressed in the similarity of some pre-fight and pre-dance rituals, and the Maring say that those who come to dance come to fight. The size of a visiting dancing contingent is consequently taken to indicate the number and strength of warriors whose assistance may be expected in the next round of warfare. IV We may now examine those aspects of rituals which suit them to function as homeostats and communication devices. I shall take up communications first, because it is the more inclusive category and the more fundamental to ritual. Let us note first that the term "ritual" is not confined to religious practices. Freud (1907) applied the closely related or even synonymous term "ceremony" to the behav- ior of some neurotics as well as to religious rituals, in an attempt to elucidate their putative similarities, and the latest Webster International Dictionary widens the perspec- tive further when it informs us that the term "ritual" in its broadest sense refers to "any practice.. .regularly repeated in a set precise manner so as to satisfy one's sense of fitness. . ." (1965:1961). This definition, which easily subsumes the rites of the faithful, the performances of headwaiters and the obsessional behavior of some neurotics, explicitly identifies three aspects of rituals: namely, that they are composed of conventional, even stereo- typed movements or postures, that they are performed "regularly" (at times fixed by clock, calendar or specified circumstance), and that they have affective or emotional value. There is, in addition, an implication that at least some of the components of rituals, in some instances even entire rituals, are non-instrumental in the sense that they do not contribute directly to the biological or economic well-being of the performer. A rather wide range of human behavior may thus be labeled ritual but the term has even more general application. Ethologists have also used the term ritual to refer to animal displays, some of which bear close formal resemblance to human rituals. Animal rituals are likely to involve stereo- typed, apparently non-instrumental postures</page><page sequence="5">Rappaport ] RITUAL, SANCTITY AND CYBERNETICS 63 and movements, and, as apparently useless paraphernalia are often manipulated in human rituals, so apparently useless bio- logical structures are often waved, vibrated, suffused with color, or expanded in animal rituals. Like human rituals, animal rituals seem to occur under specified circumstances or at fixed times, and some animal rituals, like some human rituals, occur only in special places. As the faithful of a certain persuasion congregate on Sunday mornings only in a certain church, so the starlings congregate at dusk only in certain trees. Ethologists have generally interpreted animal rituals as communication events. In light of such an interpretation even the very quality of the grotesque characteristic of some stereotyped ritual posturing becomes understandable. For a signal to be effective it must be distinguishable from ordinary instrumental activity. The more bizarre the ritual movement of structures the more easi- ly may they be recognized as ritual. Ritual to the ethologist, then, is a mode of communication distinguished from other modes of communication by its distinctive codes, namely conventionalized display. Now we have just seen that there is a close formal resemblance between human and animals rituals, and when we recall that Tsembaga rituals could easily be accom- modated in categories developed for classify- ing animals displays we note that there is also a functional resemblance. As animal rituals are communication events, so are human rituals. It goes without saying that two examples drawn from the ritual of a single human group do not provide a suf- ficient sample for propositions of such a general nature, but no space is available to marshal further evidence. We can only assert that although in some human rituals aesthetic, ethical, or affective elements are emphasized there is in all human ritual (as well as in all animal rituals) a communica- tion component. Accordingly, for our present purposes I define ritual, both animal and human, as conventional acts of display through which one or more participants transmit information concerning their physiological, psychological, or sociological states either to themselves2 or to one or more other participants. Such a definition is hardly radical; similar ones have been adopted by Wallace (1966:236), Leach (1954:14), and Goffman (1956). Both the content and the occurrence of rituals are important in communication. As far as content is concerned, many writers have dealt with ways in which information concerning social arrangements are repre- sented (communicated) in the course of pub- lic rituals, and we need not discuss the matter here. But "pattern" or "structural" information is not all that is transmitted by the contents of rituals. So is quantitative information.3 We may note first that despite the stereo- typic nature of rituals there is considerable room for variation in performance. Different numbers of organisms may participate, for instance, and in some displays this is the whole point of the exercise (Wynne- Edwards, 1962:16ff, passim). Nor is quanti- tative variation in performance limited to numbers of participants. In the potlatches of the Northwest Coast and in the pig feasts of some Melanesians rather precise information concerning social status and political in- fluence is communicated by variations in the number of valuables distributed. Indeed, it might be suggested that these rituals are pub- lic counting devices operating by principles similar to those employed in analogue com- puters. In these machines numbers are repre- sented by directly metrical quantities, such as voltages or rotations of wheels. In epideic- tic displays populations are represented by samples of themselves. In the potlatch repre- sentation is also directly metrical if less intrinsic. Here political influence is repre- sented by numbers of commodities such as blankets and copper plaques. We may note here an additional possible function of these rituals. They not only count, they tranlate aspects of phenomena which are not them- selves directly metrical into directly metrical and therefore comparable terms. It becomes easy to compare the political influence of two Melanesian big men when they are</page><page sequence="6">64 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [73, 1971 engaged in competitive feasting. One simply counts the valuables thrown into the struggle (see Oliver 1955). If it is obvious that quantitative informa- tion can be transmitted through the content of ritual, it is perhaps less obvious that qualitative information may be transmitted by ritual occurrence. The mere occurrence of a non-calendrical ritual may be a signal. Since any ritual included in the repertoire of a people can, at a particular time, only be occurring or not occurring, ritual occurrence can be regarded as a binary mechanism or variable (a mechanism or variable having only two possible states). As such, occur- rence can transmit binary information, which is qualitative information, informa- tion of a "yes-no" rather than a "more-less" sort. Of considerable interest and import- ance here, however, is that although the occurrence of a non-calendrical ritual may transmit a "yes-no" signal, it may have been triggered by the achievement or violation of a particular state or range of states of a "more-less" variable (i.e., one whose value can proceed through a continuous range of states), or even by the achievement or viola- tion of a complex state or range of complex states involving the relationship among a number of such variables. Thus, the occur- rence of the ritual may be a simple qualita- tive representation of complex quantitative information. The importance of this aspect of ritual communication may be illustrated by refer- ence to the ritual uprooting of the rumbim plant. The occurrence of this ritual, which commences the festival culminating the cycle, indicates or signals that a local ecosys- tem has achieved a certain complex quantita- tive state. The quantitative information that the qualitative or yes-no ritual statement (uprooting the rumbim) summarizes is not available to populations other than the one performing the ritual, and even if it were it would be subject to perhaps erroneous inter- pretation. Being summarized are not merely the constantly fluctuating values of a num- ber of separate variables such as numbers of pigs, acreage in production, garden yields, settlement pattern, number of women, and clinical status of the human population, but the continually changing relationships among them. It would be difficult indeed to translate quantitative information concern- ing the constantly fluctuating state of the local subsystem directly into terms that would be unambiguously meaningful to other populations in the regional subsystem. This difficulty is overcome if a mechanism is available to summarize the quantitative in- formation and translate it into a qualitative signal. Uprooting the rumbim is such a mecha- nism, for its occurrence signals unambigu- ously that the local subsystem has achieved a certain state and that, therefore, the local population may now undertake previously proscribed actions likely to affect the regional subsystem. The absence of am- biguity from this message derives from the binary character of the ritual transduction device, which reduces a great complex mass of more-less information to a simple yes-no statement. In the ordinary course of things such a statement is free of ambiguity. We may further note by way of clarifica- tion that the more-less information with which our illustration is concerned-informa- tion about labor, pigs, gardens, soils--is not directly meaningful in the regional system which is concerned with warfare. By "not directly meaningful" I mean that it cannot effect non-random proportional changes in the regional system. But the ritual, as trans- ducer, summarizes and translates this quanti- tative information into a simple non- ambiguous and meaningful statement: "the non-belligerent is becoming a potential belligerent." Control transduction in physio- logical systems also seems to rely heavily upon binary mechanisms and information precisely because of the difficulties inherent in translating quantitative information directly from one subsystem to another (Goldman 1960). In sum, both ritual content and ritual occurrence are involved in communication. While content is particularly important in the transmission of quantitative or more-less</page><page sequence="7">Rappaport ] RITUAL, SANCTITY AND CYBERNETICS 65 information and is of significance mainly within single systems or subsystems, occur- rence is particularly important in the trans- mission of qualitative or yes-no information, and is important in the transmission of in- formation across the borders of separate and unlike systems or subsystems.4 Let us now turn briefly to the regulatory functions of Maring rituals. Simple regula- tory mechanisms typically perform three operations. First is the detection of changes in the state of the regulated variable. In a thermostat this operation is accomplished by a column of mercury or a bimetallic bar. Second, the value of the regulated variable is compared with a reference, or ideal, value. In the thermostat this value is fed in through a dial. Third, if there is a discrepancy be- tween the reference and the detected value an error signal is transmitted to an effector, which initiates a corrective program. In the thermostat, the effector is a switch which turns the corrective program-heat from a furnace-on and off. The Maring ritual cycle is more com- plicated than the thermostat not because more fundamental types of control opera- tion are involved but because more variables are regulated. Whereas the thermostat regu- lates only temperature, the Maring ritual cycle regulates directly the frequency of warfare, the size of pig populations and population density, and through these varia- bles yet others, such as acreage in pro- duction, women's labor, and lengths of fallow. The picture is further complicated by a kind of economy of form. In some instances one ritual performs several control opera- tions. For instance, the uprooting of the rumbim, insofar as it involves the entertain- ment of visiting dancers, operates as a detec- tor with respect to military support. Insofar as it opens the way for animal sacrifices throughout the festival, it affects pig herd size; insofar as the slaughter of pigs accom- panies it, this ritual incorporates a portion of the corrective program, i.e., the set of actions undertaken to correct deviations in herd size from a "reference" or "ideal" value. But the aim here is not to expand an analysis presented in detail elsewhere and sketched briefly earlier in this essay of the part that rituals play in the regulation of the ecological and regional relations of the Tsembaga. It is rather to discuss the formal characteristics of rituals which make them suitable to fulfill such functions. Both ritual content and ritual occurrence are important in regulatory operation, and their importance rests upon the same formal characteristics that make them important in communication. This is hardly surprising since regulation is often a function of com- munication. As far as contents are concerned, it is perhaps sufficient to recall that display, which may be the distinguishing char- acteristic of ritual, often offers opportunities for representing the states of important variables, such as population size, numbers of available marriage partners, the numbers of men who may provide military support, the political importance of different men. Thus, ritual contents are likely to be of particular importance in the operation of detection, the operation of assessing the states of critical variables. Insofar as the values of variables as detected in displays are compared during the ritual with reference or ideal values presumably derived from else- where (for instance, men's expectations or notions about how many men should be in a particular visiting dance contingent, or how many are necessary if aggression is to be undertaken), ritual contents are also impor- tant in the comparator operation. As in the case of communication, the place of ritual occurrence in regulation is less obvious than the place of ritual contents. It may be observed first that in mechanical, electronic and physiological systems in which the states of other components may vary through a continuous range the output states of the regulator, that is, the state of its effector, is limited to two. As noted, the thermostat effector is a switch which, in response to a violation of an acceptable temperature range, goes on or off. The operation of a binary regulating device is</page><page sequence="8">66 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [73, 1971 remarkably simple. Indeed, its response to fluctuations in the state of a regulated com- ponent is the simplest conceivable: if change exceeds certain limits the regulator simply switches from one to the other of its two possible states. Perhaps the very simplicity of the binary regulatory minimizes the likelihood of its malfunction, but a more subtle aspect of binary operation is, I believe, of greater in- terest and importance. As I have argued else- where (1968:234), "Binary control elimi- nates the possibility of error from one phase of system operation: i.e., with binary opera- tion an inappropriate response to a system- endangering change in the value of a variable can not be selected from a set of possible responses because the set of possible responses has only one member. To put it in anthropomorphic terms, the binary regu- lating mechanism, once it receives a signal that a variable has transgressed its tolerable range, does not have to decide what to do. It can do only one thing or nothing at all." This statement seems to be as applicable to Tsembaga ritual as to mechanical regula- tors. Despite the complexity of the system its regulatory operations are simple, for the programs undertaken to correct deviations of variables from their acceptable or "goal" ranges are fixed. All that the actors need decide is whether in fact such a deviation has occurred. The Tsembaga reach such deci- sions through discussions, through which a consensus eventually forms. While Maring ritual regulation benefits from its very simplicity it must be recog- nized that it also suffers from simplicity's limitations. Consensus concerning deviations from acceptable conditions form slowly, and corrective programs are both inflexible and unlikely to be proportional to deviations. While such sluggish and imprecise regulation has been sufficient to maintain the Tsembaga and other Maring in a relatively stable environment it is likely that the novel challenges presented frequently in rapidly changing environments might require more rapid and more flexible regulatory mecha- nisms, such as discrete human authorities occupying recognized offices. Polynesian chiefs, for instance, are more expensive to keep than ritual cycles and can make more mistakes. But they can respond to system- endangering changes in the environment with more sensitivity, speed, precision, and flexibility than ritual cycles. V Rituals, then, because of certain formal characteristics, are suitable for both com- munication and regulatory functions. But no religious notion inheres in our definition of ritual, nor does any religious belief seem to be vital to the functions which we have ascribed to ritual. Why, then, is it that religious beliefs should so often be asso- ciated with rituals and what indeed do we mean by religious beliefs? A comparison of religious rituals with the secular rituals of men and animals proves helpful here. Earlier I underlined formal characteristics common to all rituals. Here I emphasize an important difference between religious and secular rituals: in the secular case the seman- tic content of the ritual is exhausted by the social information transmitted in the ritual. For example, when a baboon presents his rump, he transmits a statement of submis- sion to a dominant animal. There are no meanings to be discovered in the content of this ritual other than that of submission. To put this a little differently, the semantic content of the ritual and the semantic con- tent of the messages transmitted between those participating in the ritual are coexten- sive. This is also true of such human rituals as bowing and saluting. Religious rituals seem to be different. For example, the culturally avowed purpose of rituals in which the Maring transmit messages about military support is to honor deceased ancestors. The messages transmit- ted in the ritual and the purposes of the ritual are thus distinct from each other. Since the ostensible purpose of the ritual is recognized in its contents, we may obviously say that the semantic content of the ritual and the semantic content of the social</page><page sequence="9">Rappaport ] RITUAL, SANCTITY AND CYBERNETICS 67 messages transmitted between participants in the ritual are not coextensive. Such lack of coextensiveness is characteristic, perhaps definitive, of religious rituals. In addition to messages concerning the physiological, psychological, and sociological states of the participants, a religious ritual always in- cludes an additional term, such as a state- ment about or to spirits, who are usually, if not always, associated with the culturally avowed purpose of the ritual. That there is semantic differentiation be- tween messages and statements of purpose does not mean that the two are unrelated. They are related in an important way. Atten- tion to the purpose of the ritual sanctifies the messages which are transmitted within it. It may seem that this is a roundabout way to come to a shopworn 'definition of the religious as the sacred. But the procedure has not been an attempt merely to show that religious rituals are sacred while others are not, but to show that the sanctity of re- ligious rituals stands in a certain relation to the communication which occurs in the rituals. Before returning to this point, I want to suggest that since the essence of ritual is communication, and since religious ritual is presumably found only among humans, there is likely to be a connection between sanctity and the special characteristics of human communication. Linguists and ethologists, I think, general- ly agree that the most important distinction between human and animal signaling lies in the relationship of signals to their referents. I believe that this aspect of communication events distinguishes human from animal ritual as nicely as it does language from mere affective vocalization. This becomes clear in comparisons of formally similar rituals among men and beasts, for instance, the epigamic. displays of peacocks or European ruffs on the one hand and New Guinea High- landers on the other. In both, special feather paraphernalia adorning males is moved in stereotyped ways in the presence of females as a prelude to mating. But inasmuch as the peacock grew his fan himself, it is plausible to assume that the rustling of the fan is as much a part of his sexual arousal as his tumescence. His display, that is, is related to his arousal as a distant nimbus is to forth- coming rain. It is a perceptible aspect of an event indicating the presence of other imper- ceptible aspects of the same event. It is, in other words, a "sign." Obviously, the relationship of the signal to the event in the human ritual is different. The waving of bird plumes and dancing are not intrinsic to the interest of the Maring dancer in women. They are merely arbitrary indications of that interest. As such the signal is not related to the referent as the nimbus is to rain, but as the word "rain" is to actual precipitation. In other words, it is a "symbol." The advantages of symbolic over non- symbolic communication are so enormous that some anthropologists have claimed that the emergence of the symbol can be com- pared in novelty and importance to the emergence of life. With symbolic communi- cation an unlimited variety of messages may be transmitted through the combination of a very small number of basic units, and dis- course upon past, future, distant, and imaginary events becomes possible. These advantages have been thoroughly discussed by many authors and need not be belabored here. The point I want to make is that con- sidering the fundamental importance of symbolic communication surprisingly little attention has been paid to a problem which is a concomitant of its very virtues, a prob- lem which is central to our present concerns. When communication is limited to signs, that is, when the signal is intrinsic to its referent, it is impossible for the signal to occur in the absence of its referent or for it not to occur in the presence of its referent. The implication is that it is impossible for lies to be transmitted by signs. Misinterpre- tation, misreading of received information, is of course possible, but the willful transmis- sion of false information is not. Lying seems possible if and only if a signal is not intrinsic to its referent. A Maring, for instance, can indicate an interest in women when he has no such interest. If</page><page sequence="10">68 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [73, 1971 this seems trivial, note that he can also indi- cate a willingness to help in warfare when he has no such intention, and similarly a group can plant rumbim when it does not plan to leave off warfare. Lies are the natural off- spring of symbols. They are transmitted by symbolic communication and symbolic communication only. Although there seems to be some very limited use of symbols by infra-human animals and some instances of possible lying among them have been ob- serveds we can assert with considerable confidence that although man is not, per- haps, the world's only liar he is surely the world's foremost liar. Certainly his reliance upon symbolic communication exceeds that of other animals to such an extent that it is probably for man alone that the transmis- sion of false information becomes a serious problem. His very survival may be involved. It is plausible to argue that the survival of any population depends upon social interactions characterized by some minimum degree of orderliness6 and that orderliness depends upon communication. But communication is effective only if the recipients of messages are willing to accept, as being in at least some minimum degree reliable, the messages which they receive. If they are unwilling or unable to give credence to received informa- tion, it is plausible to assume that their responses to particular stimuli will approach randomness. To the extent that actions are random they are unpredictable and are thus likely to elicit further apparently random responses on the parts of other actors. Ran- domness begets greater randomness, reduc- ing orderliness more and more, perhaps eventually to such a degree that the popula- tion could not fulfill its biological needs. Credibility gaps are extremely dangerous, and societies which rely upon symbolic com- munication are faced with the problem of assuring some minimum degree of both credibility and credence in the face of the ever-present possibility of falsehood.7 Concerning some messages there may be little problem. It is possible, for instance, to transmit the proposition 1 + 1 = 3, but the recipient of such a message has at his dis- posal a set of logical operations for verifying or falsifying such a statement. Given the meaning assigned to the terms, 1 + 1 always equals two; to deny it, as does the statement 1 + 1 = 3, is to be self-contradictory and therefore false. Similarly, we might have little difficulty with a statement such as the application of heat to liquid water causes it to solidify as ice. Such a statement, while not internally illogical, as is 1 + 1 = 3, could again be invalidated empirically. But much socially important information is concerned not with the laws pertaining to variables, but with their contemporary states, and their contemporary states usually can not be ascertained by extrapolation from earlier ex- perience, even when the earlier experience can be framed in terms of empirical law (for example, to know from experience that ice melts if sufficient heat is applied to it says nothing about the temperature of a particu- lar body of H20 at the present time). In sum, the recipients of messages concerning the states of variables are not always in a position to perform the operations necessary to verify or falsify either empirically or logi- cally the information upon which they must act. In some instances, indeed, there may be no known operations of verification. This is particularly true and particularly important with respect to social commitments. For example, how do the hosts at a Maring festi- val know that those who have come to dance will come to fight? There seems to be no procedure by which their statements of com- mitment can be verified. How, then, can they be depended upon? Let us be reminded that this message is transmitted in the course of a religious rit- ual, a ritual that has a purpose to honor dead' ancestors, distinct from its message con- cerning military support. It is thus plausible to assume a belief on the part of at least some of the participants in the existence of deceased ancestors; to assume otherwise would make nonsense of the proceedings. We can thus say that fundamental to Maring religious rituals are such propositions as</page><page sequence="11">Rappaport ] RITUAL, SANCTITY AND CYBERNETICS 69 "Deceased ancestors persist as sentient beings." Now statements such as the ancestors are alive and well in the other world are neither logically necessary truths nor are they sub- ject to empirical confirmation or discon- firmation. Yet they are taken to be unques- tionably true. Indeed, to paraphrase some theologians and philosophers (Bochenski 1965; Hick 1963), it is this characteristic rather than substantive content that is the criterion of religious discourse; since relig- ious discourse is sacred discourse I take this characterisitc to be the criterion of san4ity as well. Sanctity, I am asserting, is the qual- ity of unquestionable truthfulness imputed by the faithful to unverifiable propositions. Sanctity thus is not ultimately a property of physical or metaphysical objects, but of dis- course about such objects. It is not, for instance, the divinity of Christ, but the assertion of his divinity, which is sacred. Following this line I suggest that it is not its substance which distinguishes religion from other aspects of human life, but rather the sacred nature of its assertions. The term religion, in my view, refers to public dis- course which includes at least one sacred statement and the conventional social actions undertaken with respect to this dis- course. While sanctity inheres ultimately in such non-material propositions as "The Godhead is a trinity," setting them above any doubt, it penetrates to (sanctifies) sentences con- cerning material objects and activities. Tight theological discourse may serve as the vehicle for transporting sanctity from an ultimate sacred proposition such as "The lord our God the lord is one" to sentences such as "Eating pork is evil," or "Pork may not be eaten," but the connection may be merely an association in time or space; that is, the connection may be ritualistic rather than linguistic. Messages such as "we will lend you military support," or "we have renounced warfare," when they are transmit- ted in a religious ritual, and are thus sancti- fied, are taken to be true, or at least suf- ficiently reliable to serve as the basis of important social action. Sanctity, although it inheres ultimately in unverifiable non- material propositions, is socially important as meta-statement about assertions of a material nature, such as "we will support you in warfare" or of a partly material nature such as "giving is blessed." State- ments, all of whose terms are material, may be amenable to verification, but the receivers of messages containing such statements may be in no position to verify them. However; to sanctify statements is to certify them. It would be naive to assert that sancti- fication insures the truth of messages. We all know, for instance, that people lie under oath. But it is also unnecessary to claim that sanctity eliminates falsehood, although it may help. Experience does inform us that most people are loath to sanctify informa- tion they know to be false. However, more weight should be given to the compli- mentary point: people are more likely to accept sanctified than unsanctified messages as true. Insofar as they do, their responses to these messages will tend to be non-random, and therefore predictable. It is not necessary that the messages be at all times in fact true. What is necessary for the survival of popula- tions is that the social interactions of its members be in some minimum degree order- ly. The acceptance of messages as true, whether or not they are, contributes to this orderliness. Indeed, I have been arguing that it makes this orderliness possible and, fol- lowing a lead of Bateson's (1951:212ff), it may be claimed that belief, insofar as it results in non-random actions which lead to predictable responses, creates orderliness. To put this in other terms, the acceptance of messages as true has a result on social re- sponses similar to that of self-fulfilling prophecy. Whereas in the case of the self- fulfilling prophecy an event is the function of its prediction, the validity of certain mes- sages is a function of belief in them (Bateson 1951). Belief in them in the absence of evidence may be a function of their sancti- fication; as far as informing behavior is con-</page><page sequence="12">70 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [73, 1971 cerned, sanctity forms an additional8 mem- ber of the set which also includes the neces- sary truth of logic and empirical truth of experience. VI Inasmuch as regulation depends upon communication, questions concerning the relationship between sanctity and communi- cation are questions concerning the relation- ship between sanctity and regulation. But a large body of questions remains concerning the sanctification of particular regulatory mechanisms. It may be observed first that religious discourse can include sentences concerning almost anything, including regulatory mech- anisms. Indeed, it may be that sentences concerning regulation form the class of sentences most commonly sanctified. But this raises an important question. Although it may be that the operation of some regula- tory mechanisms-even entire control hierarchies9 -are dependent upon their sanc- tification and that their sanctity derives from their association with ultimate sacred propositions, upon what does the un- questionable status of these unverifiable propositions rest, and how is this status maintained? In some societies, force is employed. But where coercion is relied upon to support propositions for which sanctity is claimed, it is coercion rather than sanctity upon which the operation of the control hierarchy depends. I wish to confine discussion at this point to systems distinguished by the ab- sence or virtual absence of institutionalized differences in coercive ability between individuals or social segments, a state of affairs not uncommon among horticultural and hunting and gathering peoples. It is in such egalitarian societies that the importance of religious experience is clearest. Although secular information of direct social import is transmitted within many re- ligious rituals, religious rituals are under- taken implicitly or explicitly with respect to sacred propositions. While participants do not always experience strong emotion in the course of a ritual, ritual participation prob- ably does affect the emotional states of the faithful at least some of the time. While some religions emphasize ecstasy, others cultivate serenity, and yet others involve "feelings of awe." All that seems to be common to religious experience generally is that it is ineffable, that is to say, non- discursive. The importance of the non-discursive aspect of religious experience cannot be ex- aggerated. Inasmuch as the experience is non-discursive it cannot be falsified. The truth of such an experience is sufficiently demonstrated by its mere occurrence; it can- not be discredited by the discourse of the conscious mind. It happens, it is felt, and it therefore carries with it a subjective quality of truth (James 1902). Since the experience is a response to the enunciation of a sacred proposition or occurs in a place or in a ritual associated with such a proposition, that proposition partakes of the same sense of truth. In other words, ultimate sacred prop- ositions are taken to be unquestionably true because their enunciation in ritual or in the symbols kept in holy places elicits from the faithful a non-discursive, and therefore un- falsifiable, affirmation. Moreover, when this affirmation is given by participation in a public ritual, it is thereby transformed into a discursive statement (which might be render- ed "I or we affirm the sacred proposition") transmissable to other participants. As already argued, the latter are likely to accept such messages as true because of the sacred context in which they are transmitted. The circularity of this operation need not trouble us because it does not trouble the faithful; indeed, they are unlikely to be aware of it. Ritual, thus, not only invokes in the parti- cipants private religious experiences, it pro- vides a mechanism for translating these pri- vate experiences into messages of social im- port; it also provides a means for certifying these messages. The outlines of an encompassing cyber- netic loop may now be suggested. Inasmuch as religious experience is an intrinsic part of</page><page sequence="13">Rappaport ] RITUAL, SANCTITY AND CYBERNETICS 71 the more inclusive emotional dynamics of the organism, and inasmuch as the emotional dynamics of an organism must be closely related to its material state, it is plausible to assume that religious experiences are af- fected by material conditions. But the latter are, particularly in primitive societies, in some degree a function of the operation of the control hierarchy which the religious ex- perience itself supports. Thus the willing- ness, indeed the ability, of the members of a congregation to affirm through religious ex- perience the ultimate sacred propositions which sanctify the control hierarchy may be in considerable measure a function of the effectiveness of the hierarchy in maintaining equilibria in and among those variables which define their material well-being in the long run, and thus adaptation. That is, if malfunctions in the control hierarchy ad- versely affect for protracted periods the states of social and ecological variables bear- ing directly upon the material well-being of the congregation, its members are likely to become, first, unable to affirm through private religious experience the ultimate sacred propositions supporting the control hierarchy and, second, perhaps later, unwill- ing even to participate in the rituals relating to them. Sooner or later, regulatory mecha- nisms themselves must be adjusted if men are not to seek new gods. It seems that ultimate sacred propositions and the control hierarchies which they support must be com- patible with the affective processes of the communicants. This in itself could have cor- rective implications. But if regulatory mechanisms or entire control hierarchies are sanctified, and that which is sanctified is taken to be unquestion- ably true, how is change possible? Three aspects of religious discourse are significant with respect to change. The first is that the ultimate sacred sentences are propositions; the second is that they usually contain no material terms. That they are propositions prevents them from containing specific directives; if they contain no material terms they are prevented from becoming irrevocably bound to any particu- lar social form. This means that the associa- tion of specific directives and social forms with ultimate sacred statements is not intrinsic, but is rather the product of inter- pretive acts. Any product of interpretation allows reinterpretation, but reinterpretation does not challenge ultimate sacred state- ments; it merely disputes previous inter- pretations. The third characteristic of religious dis- course of importance here is that it is often, if not usually, cryptic. In some cases the ultimate sacred statements are themselves cryptic; in others they may seem clear, but they are abstracted from cryptic contexts such as myths or the reports of revelations, and an apocryphal quality is often charac- teristic of the discourse which sanctifies sentences concerning particular social forms or containing specific directives by con- necting them to ultimate sacred proposi- tions. The importance of reducing ambiguity and vagueness in messages of social import was earlier noted. In contrast, it is perhaps necessary that considerable ambiguity and vagueness cloak the discourse from which sanctification flows. If a proposition is going to be taken to be unquestionably true, it is important that no one understand it. Lack of understanding insures frequent reinter- pretation. An important implication of such change through reinterpretation is that ultimate sacred propositions must remain non-specific with respect to particular regulatory mecha- nisms or processes. A possible malfunction of sanctification may be noted in this con- nection. It sometimes happens that sentences directly involved in regulation (thus including material terms and sometimes cast in the form of explicit directives) are taken not merely as sanctified by ultimate sacred propositions but as themselves ulti- mate sacred propositions. When this occurs, the control hierarchy becomes highly resistant to adjustment through reinterpre- tation with perhaps disastrous results. Possi- ble modem instances of such confusion in the level of sanctity to which sentences are</page><page sequence="14">72 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [73, 1971 to be assigned are to be found in the re- sistance of the Vatican to the use of mechan- ical and chemical birth control devices, and perhaps also in its insistence upon clerical celibacy. To an outsider, it seems that both birth control devices and clerical marriage could be made acceptable through reinter- pretation without challenge to dogma. Although sanctification is subject to mal- functions, it may be asserted that sanctity contributes to the maintenance of systemic integrity even through changes in systemic structure and composition. Indeed, it may make this maintenance possible. Thus if the term "adaptation" is given the meaning earlier suggested, then the concept of the sacred is surely an important component of human adaptation. VII The sacred, we have argued, has played an important role in the adaptation of tech- nologically simple communities to their social, biotic, and physical environments. But the role of the sacred changes with changing political circumstances, and these changes in turn seem in considerable degree to be a function of technological develop- ment. It has already been noted that sentences concerning a wide variety of regulatory mechanisms may be sanctified. Among the Maring, for instance, most sentences are in- structions for corrective programs, for example, sentences such as "the ancestors demand the slaughter of all adult and adoles- cent pigs during the festival." In other societies sanctification seems to invest sentences concerning authorities or regula- tory agencies rather than specific programs, sentences such as "the chief has great mana," or "Henry is by grace of God King." Although we, and perhaps the faithful, cast such sentences in the declarative, they imply that the directives of the regulatory agencies or authorities to which they allude should or must be obeyed. If political power is taken to be the product (in an arithmetic sense, much as force is the product of mass times acceleration) of [men] x [resources] x [organization] (Bierstadt: 1950), it would seem that as far as securing compliance with directives is concerned, sanctity operates as a functional alternative to political power among some of the world's peoples. Indeed, if authorities are taken to be loci in com- munications networks from which directives emanate we may be able to discern in history and ethnography a continuum from societies, such as the Maring, that are regu- lated by sacred conventions in the absence or near absence of human authorities through societies in which highly sanctified authorities have little actual power (such as Polynesian chiefs), to societies in which authorities have great power but less sanc- tity. It would be plausible to expect this continuum to correlate roughly with tech- nological development, for advanced tech- nology places in the hands of authorities coercive instruments that are not only effec- tive but also likely to be unavailable to those subject to them. Our argument implies that the develop- ment of technology disrupts the cybernetics of adaptation. In the technologically un- developed society, authority is maintained by sanctification, but sanctity itself is main- tained by religious experience which is responsive to the effectiveness of the control hierarchy in maintaining variables defining adaptation in viable ranges. In the technolog- ically developed society authority is freed, to the extent that technology has provided it with coercive instruments, from the con- straints imposed by the need to maintain its sanctity and therefore from the corrective operations that the maintenance of sanctity implies. This is not to say that authorities even in technologically advanced societies dispense entirely with sanctity. It is to say that the relationship between sanctity and authority changes. Previously a characteristic of the discourse associated with the regulation of the entire system, sanctity comes more and more to be concentrated in the discourse of a subsystem, "the church." When it is so confined, sacred discourse is likely to con-</page><page sequence="15">Rappaport ] RITUAL, SANCTITY AND CYBERNETICS 73 tinue to ratify authority, but it tends also to become decreasingly concerned with the en- vironment of the here and now and increas- ingly concerned with ethics and with the environment of the hereafter, the promise of which stirs the meek to religious experi- ence. Religious experience, however, and the rituals in which it occurs, previously part of an encompassing corrective loop, are event- ually left with little more than certain func- tions long recognized by students of society: they reduce anxieties produced by stressors over which the faithful have little or no control, and they contribute to the dis- cipline of social organization (see, for example, Homans 1941:172). To the extent that the discourse of religion, religious ritual and religious experience contribute to the maintenance of orderliness and the reduction of anxiety without contributing to the correction of the factors producing the anxiety and disorder they are not adaptive but pathological. Indeed, their operation seems to resemble that of neuroses (see, for example, Freud 1907). Whereas in the technologically undevelop- ed system authority is contingent upon sanc- tification, in technologically more developed societies sanctity becomes an instrument of authority. Compliance and docility are cul- tivated more efficiently and less expensively by religious experiences inspired by hopes of post-mortem salvation than by the coercion of police and inquisitions. Yet, although force may remain hidden, and although religious experience may be encouraged, in some systems the unquestionable status of the discourse for which sanctity is claimed rests ultimately upon force. In such societies authority is no longer contingent upon sanc- tity; the sacred, or discourse for which sanc- tity is claimed, has become contingent upon authority. It is interesting to recall here a distinction de Rougemont (1944) made some years ago between ordinary lies, the transmission of messages known by the sender to be untrue, and those lies which tamper with the very canons of truth. To these, in consideration of the devil's putative proclivity for appearing to be what he is not, de Rougemont applied the picturesque label "diabolical lies." It may not be inappro- priate to place in this category assertions of sanctity for discourse the unquestionable status of which rests ultimately upon force while appearing to rest upon non-discursive affirmation, and which forms part of a pa- thology while appearing to confer advantages upon those who give it credence. But although sanctity may become de- graded in the churches of technologically developed societies, "true sanctity," that uniting the organism through its affective life to processes which may correct social and ecological malfunctions, remains a con- tinuing possibility. Throughout history revi- talistic movements have emerged in streets, in universities, in fields among men sensing, and perhaps suffering from, the malfunction of control hierarchies that cannot reform themselves. In the early stages of such move- ments, at least, the unquestionable status of ultimate propositions rests upon affirmation through the religious experiences of the par- ticipants who believe that they are partici- pating in corrective action. Sometimes they are mistaken. Although such movements have not infrequently been more disruptive than that to which they are a response, they may nevertheless be regarded as one of the processes through which cybernetic systems including men, and sometimes other living things as well, rid themselves of the patholo- gy of unresponsiveness. VIII This discussion has assumed the existence of a full-blown concept of sanctity. Another set of questions might be asked concerning the origin of the sacred, for it does not seem to be logically entailed by symbolic com- munication, as does falsehood. Waddington (1961) has argued that before a man or animal can function as a unit in a proto-cultural or cultural system he must be prepared for the role of receiver or acceptor of socially transmitted information. A recent lead provided by Erikson</page><page sequence="16">74 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [73, 1971 (1968:713ff) suggests that we examine very closely in this regard the phylogeny of rituals of ontogeny, paying particular atten- tion to their affective component. Experi- mental and clinical evidence suggests that among the higher vertebrates if the infant does not learn certain things at certain times ("sensitive periods," Hinde 1966:395ff) he has difficulty learning them at all and his later learning of other material is also likely to be impaired (Scott 1964:234ff). This early learning is social in that it requires other organisms, and communication in some sense is always involved. In discussing human infants Erikson notes that this early communication takes place in "daily rituals of greeting and nurturance." It is reasonable to refer to these inter- actions of mother and child as rituals, for although there is variation from one mother to the next, each handles her child in a more or less stereotyped way and vocalizes her own repetitive, stereotyped variety of baby talk at times fixed by the clock or particular circumstances. Although some of her behav- ior is concerned with the fulfillment of the child's bodily needs some of her actions, such as her conventional coos and caresses, are non-instrumental. Perhaps this early interaction must be ritualized, for what the mother must com- municate to the child is her dependability, and what better way to communicate dependability than through the performance of stereotyped, repetitive acts at fixed times? What the child is learning specifically in these earliest ritual experiences is that he will not be abandoned by her upon whom he depends utterly (Erikson 1968:716); that is, the infant is learning to trust, and it is in- teresting to note Erikson's suggestion that the mother whom he is learning to trust is experienced as a "hallowed presence" (1968:714). It may be suggested that the trust vested in this "hallowed presence" is a necessary precondition for the acceptance of symbolic messages, first from the mother herself and then from others, as true or at least sufficiently reliable to be acted upon. It seems that failure in these early ritual con- tacts has severe effects upon the later development of communicative ability in humans (Erikson 1968:714; Frank 1966). Erikson's lead suggests that perhaps grad- ually, as symbolic communication became increasingly complex, the concept of sanc- tity arose out of the trust which, learned earliest of all things in the mother-offspring dependency relationship, is a necessary pre- condition for the acceptance of messages which the recipient cannot verify. There may be opportunities here for profitable dialogue among the members of several dis- ciplines or even for interdisciplinary research in the evolution of the socialization of the young, focusing particularly upon the rituals of ontogeny. It is likely that we shall never know whether this suggestion is more than possible. Nevertheless, we may conclude by asserting that the concept of the sacred is not only made possible by man's symbolic communication. It makes symbolic com- munication and the social and ecological orders depending upon symbolic communi- cation possible. NOTES 1This paper was written while I was a fellow of the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation and of the East-West Center. I am grateful to both of these institutions for their support. I also wish to acknowledge the valuable suggestions I have received from Gregory Bateson, Herbert Long, Robert Levy, Mervyn Meggitt, Henry Orenstein, Eric Wolf, and Milton Yinger. 2 Wallace (1966:235) argues that private prayer and other stereotyped acts performed in solitude may be regarded as auto-com- munication, communication with the self. I agree. I do not believe that the admission of messages which are sent and received by components of a single organism or psyche to the category "communication events" should strain our notion of communication. We do regard as communication messages sent and received by components of a single system when that system is a social group or a machine. In any case we are dealing here only with rituals in which two or more organisms of the same species participate.</page><page sequence="17">Rappaport ] RITUAL, SANCTITY AND CYBERNETICS 75 3 Here and throughout this essay the term "information" is generally used in its popu- lar sense. 4 Occurrence is also, of course, important within systems or subsystems, for it can signal unambiguously to the participants a change of systemic state. S The late Warren McCullough told me that he had once seen a male baboon, in captivity, present his rump to another male, whom he bit as he mounted. This might constitute an example of lying in a non- human species. I do not regard "playing possum" and similar ruses noted among other animals as true lying (if such a phrase is possible) because the deceived animal is a member of another species. That is, the senders and receivers of information in such cases do not share communication con- ventions. The carnivore, taking the marsupial for dead, is simply misinterpreting alarm behavior, and thus deceiving himself. 6 Orderliness is not synonymous with "order," as the latter term is used in such phrases as "law and order." By orderliness I mean here the opposite of randomness. Orderliness is a theoretically metrical aspect of all systems (see Wallace 1958). 7 This is not to say that the ability to lie is maladaptive, or that lying itself is in all cases destructive. 8Yet another member of this set are propositions the validity of which depends upon belief in them, but in which the belief depends not on sanctification but upon what Bateson (1951:215f) has called "deutero- learning." 9The concept of control hierarchies is related to the cybernetic concept of adapta- tion expressed earlier, which suggests that any living system, whether it be an organism or an aggregate of organisms, adapts to specific stresses through a large number of specific homeostatic mechanisms. But adaptation for any living system as a whole is much more than a bundle of more or less distinct feedback loops. When we refer to the adaptation of any living system in a general sense we imply much more than the sum of its special adaptations, for its special adaptations may be in part contradictory and must be adapted to each other. Thus, the total adaptation of an organism or group of organisms must take the form of enor- mously complex sets of interlocking feed- back loops arranged, in part, hierarchically. That is, not only will mechanisms regulating material variables be present, but regulators regulating these regulators, and yet others regulating some of these are also likely to be included. The term "control hierarchy" designates such organization. In human societies they are likely to be in part em- bodied in governmental organizations and the like, and such familiar structures approx- imate what is designated by the term in this paper. The apparent familiarity of the structure of some control hierarchies should not lead us to believe that we are sufficiently familiar with their manner of operation, with the extent to which they are in fact cybernetic, with the conditions under which their operation remains cybernetic, with their enormous complexity. It may also be well to note that the structure of rational bureaucracies and business organizations may be to some extent misleading as a paradigm for control hierarchies in general. Whereas such organizations are likely to re- flect at least to some extent the elegance of reasoned design, control hierarchies that have emerged through natural evolutionary processes are likely to reflect the opportun- ism and "messiness" characteristic of evolu- tion (Kalmus 1966).
