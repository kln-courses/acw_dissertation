Orlaith McBride, Director of the Arts Council, has exhorted the new Arts Minister to 'value the unmeasurable' and more practically to 'energise her cabinet colleagues in a deeper and passionate commitment to the arts'. But with well less than two years in office before the next election, what (or reclamation!) of the old Irish Parliament building on College Green and its conversion into a National Centre for Literature.

Ministers don't leave a mark for all the routine work they do at the bidding of their officials travelling the length and breath of the country to festivals, openings and performances. Jimmy Deenihan will probably be remembered more for the botched Limerick City of Culture fiasco than anything else. He did however launch one initiative that could have been memorable but which he failed to bring to fruition. That was the acquisition of an annual Contemporary Art Festival in the capital displaying the best of Irish art and design including painting, photography, prints and 1 heather Humphreys graphic design of every nature, crafts, sculpture and yes, street art galore. page 12) but that too will be featuring mostly It is hard to understand why Dublin does not international work.

Horst (1906-19991, from 6 September 2016 to A January 2015. In his illustrious 60-year career, German-born Horst worked predominantly in Paris and New York and creatively traversed the worlds of photography, art, fashion, design, theatre and high society. Horst: Photographer of Style' will display 250 photographs, alongside haute couture garments, magazines, film footage and ephemera. Horst's career straddled the opulence of pre-war Parisian haute couture and the rise of ready-to-wear in post-war New York and his style developed from lavish studio set-ups to a more austere approach in the tatter half of the 20th century. The exhibition will be supported by Kildare Village near Dublin. In celebration of this partnership, Kildare Village is delighted to announce that a pop up gallery on the mall will display 20 replica prints of Horst's fashion photographs for a limited time. Highlights will include some of Horst's most accomplished compositions, featuring fashion ensembles from couture houses such as Chanel and Schiaparelli and portraits of Hollywood stars including Martene Dietrich. Maria McGovern, Director, Kildare Village announced: 'We are delighted to present this pop-up gallery at Kildare Village this autumn to mark our exciting partnership with the V&amp;A and to showcase the work of this fine 20th-century photographer. We look forward to welcoming many visitors to the Village. The Horst exhibition at the V&amp;A is an excellent fit for Kildare Village as it will showcase iconic photographs of 20th century fashion and society.' To accompany the retrospective, the V&amp;A has published a book entitled Horst: Photographer of Style.

Darek, who is of Polish descent, is now heading to the Royal College of Art in London for a post-graduate programme in Fine Art Photography. Of course, the principal congratulations go to the MAC centre (whose new building was featured in the Spring 2012 edition of the Irish Arts Review) and the principals behind the bright idea for this new international art prize. People like Hugh Mulholland, the curator at MAC, and the chief executive there Anne McReynolds. Also Suzanne Lyle of the Arts Council in Northern Ireland and indeed the culture minister herself Caral Ni Chuilin. The new competition attracted no less than 1,061 submissions world-wide but this massive entry has now been short-listed to only 24 of which 4 come from Ireland. Apart from Darek Fortas, the others are Maria McKinney (sculpture] Dougal McKenzie (painting] and Colin Drake (sculpture]. One big reservation on this welcome development has to be stated. The big thrust behind this initiative is to attract tourists and to add an arty gloss to Belfast's image - which is all very well and good and why the whole project is sponsored principally by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board. But the odds are against any one Irish artist gaining one cent from the whole project which is likely to cost up to £100,000 in all. The winner will be announced on 30 October and an exhibition of the entries will run in all three MAC galleries until 18 January 2015. ■ JM p Gallery 1 THE PAST IS PRESENT Jennifer Trouton Cu rated by Anya von Gosseln ^Mji 1 Gallery 2 PATIENT STARING Anne Hendrick, Aileen Murphy, Emma Roche Curated by Paul Doran 19th October - 3rd December 2014 Opening: Saturday 1 8th October at 4pm Image: Jennifer Trouton, Longue Dude, oil on linen, 152 x 121 cms, 2014 Wexford Arts Centre Tel: +353 53 9123764 Cornmarket, Wexford E: info@wexfordartscentre.ie m jm jr wexforo HffUcm ▼Jlf HDm mm V Arts for all, Arts for life ■■wi'uiflfll Mnw.iim 12 IRISH ARTS REVIEW I AUTUMN 2014 1 DAREK FORTAS</page><page sequence="5">AUTUMN 2014 Artnews Vera Klute's portrait of Sister Stan To be commissioned by the National Gallery of Ireland for an addition to its National Portrait Collection must be the dream of every portraitist in the country and such was the happy experience recently of Vera Klute, the 33-year-old graduate from Dun Laoghaire IADT, whose portrait of Sr Stanislaus Kennedy was unveiled last month. Klute has been building up her reputation with recent solo shows at the LAB, Dublin, the Butler Gallery in Kilkenny and the Wexford Arts Centre. She has been accepted twice for RHA exhibitions in one of which was her portrait of Oliver Cummins although portraiture has not been the dominant theme in her work. So it was something of a surprise that she was commissioned to paint Sr Stan for the NGI. Her portrait of Sr Stan is as plain as you might expect with the subject seated in an office chair with an unadorned background and devoid of any symbolism except for the small gold cross hanging from her neck. True to form, the social justice campaigner is shown with her severe haircut and in trousers - a woman looking worried about the state of the marginalized in Irish society. Technically, the representation is assured: only the treatment of the Robinson, followed by James Hanley's Ronnie Delaney, left hand appears, to this writer, a little awkward.

As the curtain comes down on the annual RHA exhibition in Dublin, final preparations are being made for the Royal Ulster Academy's annual exhibition which will open on 17 October at the Ulster Museum in Belfast. Like the RHA, the RUA has been on the go for a long time in one manifestation or another. Originally founded in 1879 as the Belfast Ramblers Sketch Club, it adopted the grander name of the Ulster Academy of Arts in 1930 and the final moniker of Royal Ulster Academy in 1956. The current President is Colin Davidson whose work is well known to IAR readers and was featured on our front cover in summer 2011. But RUA is that it has to struggle along without either a permanent home or a decent subvention from government. While the RHA last year happily drew support from the Arts Council of €350,000, the RUA's subvention from any public funds was less than €20,000. Fortunately for the RUA, KPMG the accountancy firm has been a principal sponsor for the organization and also sponsors the Emerging Artists Award at the annual exhibition which last year went to Natalia Black. Incidentally, the Best Sculpture Award last year went to Bob Sloan the subject of our interview on page 80. Although two RHA members, David Crone and Neil Shawcross, I THE PROBLEM FOR THE RUA IS THAT IT HAS TO STRUGGLE ALONG WITHOUT EITHER A PERMANENT HOME OR A DECENT SUBVENTION FROM GOVERNMENT apart from both clinging to the 'Royal' appellation, the RHA and the RUA appear to have little in common. Indeed even to call themselves 'academies' at all is a bit of a misnomer as the RHA has only recently involved itself again is some degree of education while the RUA's connection to education is pretty tenuous. The problem for the are also members of the RUA, it is surprising that there is not more co-operation between the two organizations.

In your article entitled 'What now for Aosdana?' you state that 'It is not generally known that when Theo Dorgan and Colm Toibin lobbied the Arts Council in 2008 for an increase to €20,000 in the annual cnuas subvention, that the AC set a condition on their approval. The condition was that actors should be admitted to Aosdana's membership which was limited to 'creative artists'. This was a step too far for Cronin et at and the increase never came through.' The Arts Council has never set a condition on its approval of the level of the cnuas. Because of the economic crisis, the Aosdana General Assembly of 2010 voted to forego a raising of the cnuas to €20,000. The membership have, in effect, voluntarily accepted a 12.5% reduction in the value of the cnuas.
