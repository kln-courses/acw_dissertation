<plain_text><page sequence="1">46 French Studies EARLY MEDIEVAL LITERATURE By G. S. Burgess, Senior Lecturer in French, University of Liverpool 1. General Noteworthy this year is the vol. offered to Pierre Jonin (Melanges Jonin), which contains numerous arts devoted to early med. Fr. lit. C. M?la has publ. Blanchefleur, a collection of essays which includes 'La bourse ou la vie: l'enjeu comique', pp. 77-122, a gen. study of comedy which draws on several genres, parti cularly the theatre. C. W. Aspland's A Medieval French Reader, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 426 pp., is a useful and solid contribu tion with substantial extracts and a lit. commentary. Also very welcome is A. Foulet and M. B. Speer, On Editing Old French Texts, Lawrence, Kansas, The Regents Press, 136 pp., which contains in addition to a survey of editorial problems a history of attitudes adopted towards Old French texts. A rev. art. is devoted to this vol. by J. Beer, TLTL: 42-48, which includes remarks by G. S. Burgess under the title 'Editions of Old French texts: some desiderata9, pp. 44-47. P. Zumthor, RR, 70:205-18, explores the role of the medievalist and the question of method in med. studies. Recent trends in med. lit. studies are examined by S. G. Nichols, Jr, MH, 8, 1977:77-101. Lough, Writer and Public, contains a chapter on the writer and the patron in the Middle Ages, pp. 7-30. M.-J. Paquette has ed. Poemes de la mort de Turold a Villon, Union Gdndrale d'fidition, 192 pp., in which the text with facing transl. of HOlinant de Froidmont's Vers de la Mort is worthy of note. D. Kelly, PQ, 57, 1978:287 310, examines three prominent modes of translatio in med. Fr. translation including scribal transmission, adaptation, and allegorical or extended metaphorical discourse. An important contribution this year to the interpretation of med. texts is T. Hunt, 'Prodesse et delectare: metaphors of pleasure and instruction in Old French', NMi, 80:17-35. A study of the literary views and terminology of med. writers, who clearly indicate their views, leads to the conclusion that delectatio was entirely justifiable and that 'we should resist the temptation to subject secular works to interpretative techniques drawn from theology and Scripture'. The med. and modern understanding</page><page sequence="2">Early Medieval Literature 47 of symbolism is analysed by G. B. Ladner, Sp, 54:223-56, and the symbolism of the pelican, which represents 'la nostalgie d'une eau nourrici&amp;re et maternelle5, is studied by I. Malaxe cheverria, JV, 63:491-97. R. T. Pickens surveys a wide variety of texts in his perceptive discussion of 'Historical consciousness in Old French narrative5, FrF, 4:168-84. The motif of the pull of Nature is examined by K. V. Sinclair in 'Mature trait in medie val French5, ZFSL, 89:151-58. P. E. Bennett looks at the extant accounts of two unpromising heroes, Havelok and Rainoart, and shows that the texts present essentially variants of the same folktale, Fo, 90:77-90. 2. Epics Bibl. material is provided by P. Barrette, 01, 6, 1978:119-28, and by Bull. Bibl. de la Soc. Rene., Paris, Nizet, 11 (for 1978), 201 pp. N. Voorwinden and M. De Haan have publ. Oral Poetry: Das Problem der miindlichkeit mittelalterlicher epischer Dichtung (WF, 555), 291 pp. In 'Oral composition: a recapitu latory view of its nature and impact5, NMi, 80:97-109, R. Eichmann stresses the qualities of interchangeability and flexibility in the two basic ingredients of orally composed works, the formula and the theme. M. Curschmann discusses 'The concept of the oral formula as an impediment to our under standing of medieval oral poetry5, MH, 8, 1977:63-76. K. von See has ed. Europaische Heldendichtung (WF, 500), 1978, 463 pp., which contains several previously publ. arts concerning French epics. S. G. Nichols, Jr, looks at 'The generative function of chant and ricit in Old French epic5, 01, 6:305-25, and J. Victorio views 'La chanson de geste comme moyen de propa gande5, LR, 33:309-28. In her discussion of 'The nature of rhetoric in the chansons de geste\ 94, 1978:305-20, H. S. Kay points to the contrast between epic rhetoric and that of hagiography, romance and other genres. Rhetoric in the chansons de geste is not that of the manuals: it is oriented towards content rather than language, colloquial, and adapted to the physical and the emotionally intense or dramatic. D. J. Ross examines expressions of minimal worth in the epics, RMS, 4, 1978:69-90, and F. Dubost surveys the use of the term giant, Milanges Camproux, 1, pp. 299-313, showing that there are three</page><page sequence="3">48 French Studies types of giants and that their 'nature morale' is just as impor tant as their size. The role of siege machines is discussed by J.-C. Vallecalle, Melanges Jonin, pp. 689-702, and P. Bancourt looks at Moslem art and the decoration of Saracen interiors in i2th-c. chansons de geste, ib., pp. 63-88. M. de Combarieu studies the 'jeune musulmane' as an epic character, ib., pp. 181-96, and J. Raynaud analyses the role of the 'aubergistes ^piques', ib.9 pp. 559-67. The use of stereotyped narrative sequences is seen by M. Rossi, ib., pp. 579-91, as an aspect of epic technique. roland. P. Jonin has ed., with facing transl. and lengthy introd., La Chanson de Roland, Paris, Gallimard, 437 pp. The Proceedings of the Roncevaux 778-1978 conference held at Pennsylvania State U., 5-7 Oct. 1978, appear in 01, 6:198-364. G. J. Brault introduced the conference with remarks on ' The Song of Roland 778-1978', ib., 201-12. M. Eusabio examines the MS trad, in 'Rolandiana minima', CN, 37:167-86. T. Hunt views Roland as a tragedy in Aristotelian terms and suggests that crusading ideology has interferred seriously with the original tragic force and destroyed the unity of tone, MLR, 74: 791-805. Id. offers a stimulating analysis of the multiple problems raised by 'Character and causality in the Oxford Roland', MedRom, 5, 1978:3-33. 'La condition du heros dans la Chanson de Roland (O)', is the object of a study by P. Kirsch, Melanges Camproux, 1, pp. 385-99. In 'Le silence de Ganelon', CCMe, 21, 1978:265-74, J.-L. Picherit discusses the reason why Ganelon does not offer to treat with Marsile. Although pos sessed of good features Ganelon is induced into error by his weaknesses, envy, hatred of Roland, love of life and wealth. The legal aspects of the 'Thirty pleges for Ganelon', are analysed by E. J. Mickel, Jr, 01, 6:293-304. Stylistic variants in R. are studied by J. R. Allen, ib., 351-63. J. Deroy takes a close look at the first laisse of the R., Melanges Camproux, 1, 277-86, and the same lines are discussed by A. Noyer-Weidner in the context of the vocabulary of mountain and plain in the text, and other geographical and thematic elements, %FSL, 89: 289-318. R. Pensom thinks that the concept of auditive memory guides us towards a better understanding of the formal organi zation of the Roland, Poetique, 35, 1978:367-73. For J.-C. Payen, violence in the R. is both a duty and a pleasure, 01, 6:226-36. J. F. Benton looks at how the R. reflects the ideals of a warrior</page><page sequence="4">Early Medieval Literature 49 class,* ib.9 237-58, and E. Vance discusses the concept of illumination, ib.9 213-25. L. S. Crist writes {On believing as modalisation in the Chanson de Roland9 9 iA.,-326-38. The rela tionship of R. to its audience is discussed by H. E. Keller, ib.9 259-74, and S. A. Brown examines the question of 'The Bayeux tapestry and the Song of Roland99 ib.9 339-50. W. W. Kibler looks at what happened to the R. after the Oxford text, ib.9 275-93, and the version of/?, in the Bibliotheque Universelle des Romans, in which Roland appears as an army officer of the Ancien Regime, is the object of an art. by E. A. Babister, FMLS9 15:26-34. J.-M. Paquette studies six versions of the horn scene in terms of the contribution they make to the poetics of laisses similaires9 Melanges Jonin9 pp. 501-14. W. Decker has an art. entitled et)ber Rolandslied und Pseudo-Turpin9 9 Euph9 72, 1978:133-42, and R. N. Walpole points to a new MS of the Old French Johannes transl. of the Pseudo-Turpin Chronicle. other epics. In an important art. on the Pelerinage de Charlemagne, 'Une parodie royale du moyen age', AUSB9 8, 1977:3-25, O. Supek analyses the text closely and concludes that the work was composed for Philip I and his son, the future Louis VI, in order to suggest caution in respect of the papacy which was preparing the canonization of Charlemagne for 1105. I. Vielhauer, Amis und Amiles: altfranzosisches Epos. Geschichte einer Freundschaft am Hofe Karls des Grossen9 Amsterdam, Castrum Peregrini, no pp., is a prose transl. in modern German with a useful introd. T. Hunt, 'L'inspiration id6&gt; logique du Charroi de Nimes99 RBPH9 56, 1978:580-606, thinks that the promonarchical policy of Suger determined the structure of the text. Composed for bacheliers attempting to establish themselves economically, the Charroi9 lite the Couronne ment9 would reflect the hope and fears of the mid 1130s. A. Galmds de Fuentes, 'Le Charroi de Mmes et la tradition arabe', CCMe9 22:125-37, views the text in terms of a transfer from Arabic to Romance literature and finds no irony, comedy or parody in the text which is a pure epic. P. Jonin has a review art. on a recent book concerning Huon de Bordeaux by M. Rossi (TWML9 37:45), MA9 84, 491-95. B. Guidot looks at 'Un personnage typique au Siege de Barbastre: le paien qui trahit les siens', Melanges Jonin9 pp. 287-304, and J.

Romances Encomia, 11, ii, 151 pp., provides bibl. material for 1977. Of major importance is the Grundriss der romanischen Literaturen des Mittelalters, vol. iv, i, Le romanjusqu'a la Jin du XIIIe siecle, ed. J. Frappier and R. R. Grimm, Heidelberg, Winter, 1978, 675 pp. D. H. Green, Irony in the Medieval Romance, is of gen. interest with frequent ref. to Chretien de Troyes. W. Calin argues strongly and effectively against D. W. Robertson, Jr, whose clerical reading of secular texts is seen as an impediment to our understanding of them, SFR, 2, 1978:247-57. For E. Reiss, 'Fin'amors: its history and meaning in medieval literature', MRS, 8:74-99, Jin'amor is explicitly a spiritual love, finding expression in the sacrament of marriage and in Christian caritas. T. Hunt, 'Aristotle, dialectic, and courtly literature', Vi, 10:95-129, sees dialectic as part of much courtly literature and as a heuristic tool for its interpretation. D. Maddox looks 'Toward an analytical model for med. romance', EsC, 17, 1977: 179-94, and P. W. Hurst examines 'The encyclopedic tradition, the cosmological epic, and the validation of the med. romance', CC, 1:53-71, with particular ref. to the coronation scene in Erec et Enide. Chretien's mention of Macrobius is envisaged as directing the audience's attention towards a tradition of cosmological poetry. J. L. Grigsby revs several recent vols on symbolism in romance, RPh, 3, 1877:321-43. J.-C. Payen and H. LeGros examine the theme of amorous exchange in courtly lit., Melanges Jonin, pp. 515-25, and in 'Tragic ends of lovers: med. Islam and the Latin west', CC, 1:37-52, M. A. Manza laoui refers to Marie de France, B?roul, Thomas, Cliges and the Lai de VOmbre. L. Lerner, Love and Marriage: Literature and its Social Context, London, Arnold, 288 pp., is of gen. interest and contains refs to the legend of Tristan and to Aucassin et Nicolette. J. Leclercq, Monks and Love, has a chapter entitled 'Champagne as a garden of love', pp. 109-36, and sections on Erec et Enide, pp. 129-32, and on Andreas Capellanus, pp. 115-19. B. Bowden finds suggestive wordplay in Andreas, MH, 9:67-85, and A.

Thorpe writes on 'The last years of Geoffrey of Monmouth', Melanges Jonin, pp. 661-72. A. Gier has an art. entitled 'Zum altfranzosischen Artusroman: literarisches Spiel und Aufhebung der Zeitgesetze', Len, 16:11-24. Geoffrey and Wace used Arthur to sustain Henry IPs policies, whereas Chretien is interested in the individual problems of knights. Chretien de troyes. T. Hunt writes on the textual problems presented by Chretien's romances, FS, 33:257-71, and R. C.Johnston looks at the possible attribution to Chretien of the authorship of the Chevalier a Vepee and the Mule sans frein, MLR, 73, 1978:496-98. The author of the Mule is the better imitator of the two but not Chretien himself. Chretien's first person interventions are examined by J. L. Grigsby, RPh, 32: 261-73, who also looks at the application of T. Todorov's survey of sign, symbol and metaphor to Chretien, EsC, 18, 1978:28-40. From a mere hint in Erec, symbolism becomes stronger in Cliges and again in Lancelot, extreme in Tvain and finally lacks lucidity in Perceval. P. Haidu's study of irony in romance is based on Cliges, Poetique, 9, 1978:443-66. R. Warning takes a structural approach to the composition of Chretien's romances in an art. which appears in English, EsC, 18, 1978:41-54, and in German, WS, v, pp. 79-95. The plots are seen as actualizing a narrative scheme familiar from myths and fairy-tales. The motif of dubbing in the romances is analysed by J. Flori, R, 100:21-53, and that of the observer in the tower by B. Brend, MA, 84, 1978:443-78. M. J. Delage has some notes on Chretien and the romance of Tristan, Melanges Jonin, pp. 211-19, and E. Caldarini points to the infl. of Chretien on Petrarch's sonnet 238, BHR, 40, 1978: 143-47. 'The ethical context of firec's character' is discussed by J. Mandel, FR, 50, 1977:421-28. In 'The flaw in finide's character: a study of Chretien de Troyes' Erec\ RMS, 5:21-26, M. Coghlan sees pride as the underlying fault in both ?rec and ?nide, who are thus both matched in imperfection. A. Gier has a rev. art. on D. Maddox's book on Erec et Enide</page><page sequence="7">52 French Studies (YWML, 40:31)), ?&amp;P, 95:92-103. H. P. Schwake makes an important contribution to the study of Cliges with Der Wort schatz des Cliges von Chretien de Troyes (BRP, 149), 824 pp., and M. H. Offord compares the vocabulary of Cliges to that of Ille et Galeron by Gautier d'Arras, CLe, 34:36-52. Offord concludes that there is a considerable identity in the abstract vocabulary of both authors, but that Chretien's concrete vocabulary displays a far wider scope. His perception of the outside world is vast and varied. A. Tournon studies 'Les marques de senefiance dans le Chevalier de la Charete9, Melanges Jonin, pp. 673-87. J. Deroy thinks that Chretien's loyalty to his Dame prevented his finishing the Lancelot and that Godefroi does not tell the real end, CN, 38, 1978:67-78, but H. F. Williams is of the opinion that Chretien may not have left his romance unfinished and that Godefroi is merely a copyist, USFLQ, 18:19, 22, 26. J.-C. Lozachmeur writes 'A propos des sources du Mabinogi d'Owein et du roman d9Yvain9, EC, 15, 1978:573-75. Both texts are seen as descending from a common source, which they reproduce more or less faithfully. G. M. Voisset has an art. entitled 'Ici, ailleurs, au-delk: topographie du r?el et de rirrdel dans le Chevalier au lion9, Melanges Jonin, pp. 703-15. P. M?nard has a note on the text of the Perceval, Melanges Jonin, pp. 447-57, and C. Mela, Blanchefleur, pp. 13-46, examines the structure and meaning of the text. R. Rohr writes cZur Schuld Percevals', Melanges Camproux, 1, pp. 459-68, and S. Sturm Maddox looks at the contribution of L^vi-Strauss to Chretien's Perceval, in 'Ldvi-Strauss in the Waste Forest', EsC, 18, 1978: 82-94. other Arthurian romanges. R. O'Gorman offers 'A note on the orthodoxy of Robert de Boron', JVMi, 80:387-89, maintaining that the expression nostre char in v. 2233 (ed. Nitze) does not indicate an unorthodox belief that man had been taken to heaven in the flesh. A. Micha has publ. vols in and iv of his Lancelot: roman en prose du XIIP siecle (TLF, 262, 278), xv 4- 361 pp., xvi + 406 pp. F. P. van Oostrom, W. P. Gerritsen, and O. S. H. Lie look at cLe Lancelot en prose et ses traductions moyen-n?erlandaises', Stuip, Langue et litterature, pp. 39-49. V. M. Lagorio, 'The apocalyptic mode in the Vul gate Cycle of Arthurian romances', PQ, 57, 1978:1-22, stresses that for the contemporary public Arthur's fall was a</page><page sequence="8">Early Medieval Literature 53 mirror of their own impending doom and that the entire Vul gate cycle should be viewed as apocalyptic historiography. M, Whitaker thinks that the Quest of the Holy Grail evinces in its organized images scholastic qualities of elucidation which are characteristic of Gothic, Mosaic, 12:11-19. G. Moignet studies 'La grammaire des songes dans la Queste del saint GraaV, LaF, 40, 1978:113-19, and F. B&amp;ier analyses the episodes of the poisoned fruit and Lancelot's hunting accident in La Mort le roi Artu, TLLS, 17:7-22. tristan. A. de Mandach, 'Legend and reality: recent excavations and research in Cornwall concerning Tristan and Isolt', Trist, 4:3-24, confirms the accuracy and interest of certain details in BeVoul and affirms that the lovers must have lived in the 6th c. An accretion of tales crystallized round a tiny historical nucleus. tJ. E. Lewes, *The Life in the Forest: the Influence of the St Giles Legend on the Courtly Tristan Story, Trist. Monographs, 1, 88 pp. J. M. Ferrante sees Tristan as an artist who manipulates characters and situations to his own advan tage, Trist, 4:26-35, which suggests that he prefers the world of illusion to that of reality. D. L. Hoffman examines the implica tion of life in the forest in several versions of the story, ib., 4, 1978:55-62, and Z. P. Thundy points out the significance of the motif of the potion in the Old English poem Guthlac B and its affinity to the love charm in the Fr. Tristan romances, ib., 4, 1978:55-62. T. Scully studies 'The two Yseults', Med, 3, 1977, 25-36, and argues that they are meant to represent two mani festations of the same Yseut, the carnal, shameful, irresistible love of Iseut la blonde, and the sentimental, chaste love of Iseut aux blanches mains. M. Houdeville-Augier writes on the 'Ville et cadre de vie dans le Tristan de Bdroul', Melanges Jonin, pp. 335-45, and R. Dubuis deals with the use of the terms dm and druerie in Beroul, ib., pp. 221-31. The concepts teste and chef in Beroul are the object of a study by H.

Faure maintains that Marie's story concerns a tamed werewolf, as a true werewolf story could not have been written during a golden age. S. Neumeister sees the fairy-tale elements in Bisclavret and Lanval as symptomatic of a closed universe, Melanges Camproux, 1, pp. 429-38. J.

Two arts are devoted to Chevrefoil: G. Paoli looks at 'Le sens et la lettre' in this lai, Melanges Jonin, pp. 483-500, and M.
