(There Are No Saints Here!): Symbolic Language within Santeria Mary Ann Clark Although Santeria is commonly understood to be a syncretistic combina- tion of Catholic and West African religious practices, in this article I argue that West African religious beliefs and practices are integral to the religion while the Catholic elements are decorative and nonessential. Based on the finding that Santeria altar displays contain few or no statues of Catholic saints or other anthropomorphic figures, I suggest that the tendency within Santeria to eschew anthropomorphic figures lies at the center of devo- tees' understanding of spirituality and materiality and the place of the human body in religious practice. Seen through the practices of Santeria, there is not a natural opposition between the material and the spiritual because the material, both natural and manufactured, forms appropri- ate sites of the holy. In addition, I suggest that the Spanish terms santo, santero, and Santeria itself reflect and translate Yoruba terms and concepts rather than primarily serving to camouflage the religion.

Developed in Cuba by slaves and freed persons of color, this religion is understood to be a corrup- tion of Catholicism through the infusion of African cosmology practices and language. Perhaps the most visible site for this syncretism is the ap- propriation of the names and images (statues and lithographs) of the Catholic saints to represent the Orisha, the African deities, as well as the incorporation of the generic term santo (Sp. saint)' into the descriptive vocabulary. Underlying some of these descriptions is a subtext about the uses of idols and fetishes within "primitive" religions. One critique of such reli- gions is that they confuse what is profane (the natural or manufactured object) for the sacred (God). An evolutionary view of religion suggests that less highly evolved religions find the sacred in ordinary objects (trees and stones, for example), while at the apex of religious expression the sacred is found in the worship of the Christian godhead (Eliade: 11). Concurrent with this evolution of religiosity is a movement from animism to monotheism, from a focus on the material to a focus on the immate- rial or spiritual. Christian theologians and scholars of religion are careful to distinguish between a carefully nuanced view of the place of images within Christianity and the proliferation of idols and images in other religious systems. The case of Santeria is especially interesting in this regard. Scholars looking at this religion often suggest that statues and images, particularly those taken from the colonial Catholic environment, play a vital and important role among devotees. A review of the literature on Santeria suggests that stat- ues and other representations of the Catholic saints that are associated with the Orisha are integral to the religion (Bastide: 153-157; Brandon 1983: 175-187, 1993: 76-77, 144-145, passim; Herskovits; Murphy 1993: 32-40, 120-124, passim). For example, based on his reading of Brandon, Murphy, and others, Harry Lefever says, "So, under the constraints of their opposition, the slaves [in colonial Cuba] began to fuse the intermediar- ies of [Catholicism and their African traditional religions] and to identify a specific orisha with a corresponding specific saint. Out of this syncre- tism there developed a highly complex form of religion known as Santeria, or the way of the saints" (319). However, my research, done primarily among the Santeria practi- tioners in Houston, Texas, but also incorporating information from New 1 Because of the history of this religion, practitioners use a mixture of English, Spanish, and Yoruba vocabulary.

Looking at the altar dis- plays built by Santeria devotees for special religious events as well as those maintained on a daily basis, I discovered that not only do many Santeria altar displays contain no representations of Catholic saints but many con- tain few or no anthropomorphic figures at all.2 This absence calls into question the common understanding that Santeria is a syncretization of African and Roman Catholic elements. But it also raises a series of ques- tions about the play of spirituality and materiality and the place of the human body in this religion.3 In this article I will suggest that, seen through the practices of Santeria, there is not a-natural opposition between the material and the spiritual because the material, both natural and manufactured, forms appropriate sites of the holy. Although western tradition sees humanity as closer to the sacred than other portions of the material world, within Santeria the human form is not a privileged site of spirituality and does not seem to be considered closer to the divine than other material objects. Although the sacred within Santeria is embedded within natural and manufactured objects, devotees do not seem to find human and animal figures to be appropriate receptacles for the sacred. Thus, we find fewer, rather than more, images than we would expect. THE STANDARD VIEW OF SANTERIA Santeria is an Afro-Cuban religion with a growing presence in the United States. Hundreds of thousands of Americans participate in this religion. Some are fully committed priests and priestesses; others are "god- children" or members of a particular house tradition. Although most are of Hispanic Caribbean descent, a growing number are of African Ameri- can and European American heritage. The religion of Santeria was developed in the late nineteenth century in Cuba by slaves and gente de color (Sp. free people of color) to re-create the religious practices of their West African homeland. In his historical study, George Brandon ties contemporary Santeria practice to the colo- nial Spanish Catholic cult of personages that included the legends and stories of the saints along with the cycle of feast days and festivals associ- 2 The absence of Catholic iconography I describe in this article does not appear to be true in other African-based religions in the New World like Vodou and Candomblk. These traditions seem to have incorporated more saintly images than Santeria, but I leave that analysis to scholars of those traditions. 3 The interaction of African, European, and American religious elements in the contemporary practice of Santeria will be discussed in depth in my book (Clark).</page><page sequence="4">24 Journal of the American Academy of Religion ated with them. Among the common people, whom he calls "folk Catho- lics," the adoration of the saints often eclipsed the official practices of the Church. In the eyes of the Church hierarchy, the saints represented human beings who led virtuous lives and could serve as exemplars of religiosity; among the common people, however, the saints were repositories of mi- raculous powers that could be harnessed for the benefit of themselves, their families, and their villages (Brandon 1993: 45-48). Not only were the saints venerated in churches and at special shrines built in and around the villages; individual devotees often constructed personal altars in their homes. In addition to statues or pictures of the saints, both public and private altar displays included candles, flowers, and any variety of other idiosyncratic elements.4 Some of the earliest research on the Afro-Caribbean religions (includ- ing Santeria, Vodou, and Candomblk) note a tendency among practitio- ners of these religions to develop correspondences between their own deities and the pantheon of Catholic saints and to include the iconogra- phy associated with those Catholic saints on their own religious displays.5 Brandon includes a 1930s photograph of an altar display from Cuba that shows distinctive Santeria items including containers for the Orisha god objects on the floor and Christian objects (candles, chromolithographs of saints, etc.) on the table and walls above (1993: 121). In 1950 William Bascom also mentions the chromolithographs and plaster images of the Catholic saints he found prominently displayed in the shrines and homes of Santeria practitioners (1950: 65). Much of the literature on the African religions in the Americas highlights the correspondence between the dei- ties of these religions and Catholic saints. Most books about these reli- gions (both scholarly and popular) have a chart of correspondences be- tween the deities, the saints, and, in some cases, other items (Brandon 1983: 175-177 table 2-1, 1993: 77; Brown 1989: 494; Lefever 1996: 320; Murphy 1993: 42-43). In the article based on his presentation to the Second Afro-Brazilian Congress in Bahia, Brazil, in November 1936, Melville J. Herskovits gives an early version of these correspondences as collected by researchers in Brazil, Cuba, and Haiti (641-642).6 In his article, Herskovits suggests the 4 William Christian's research on Catholic folk practices in contemporary, Renaissance, and late medieval Spain provides the best source for looking at the historical basis of this account (1972, 1977, 1981a, 1981b). See also Kay Turner's work on contemporary Mexican American home altars (1982, 1990). 5 In Santeria and Candombl6 these deities are call Orisha, in Vodou, Lwa or Loa. In their origi- nal languages (Yoruba and Fon, respectively) these terms can be either singular or plural; how- ever, many scholars indicate plurals by the addition of "s" to form Orishas and Lwas. 6 Herskovits's earliest citation, Nina Rodrigues's L'Animisme Fetichiste des N~gres de Bahia, was published in 1900.</page><page sequence="5">Clark: iNo Hay Ningin Santo Aqui! (There Are No Saints Here!) 25 most common explanation for this syncretization: an effort on the part of the practitioners of these "fetish cults" to hide their activities behind a veneer of the dominant religion (636). He suggests that what he saw as the prominent displays of Catholic elements and the identification be- tween the "African gods and Catholic Saints" was evidence of a "synthe- sis between aboriginal African patterns and the European traditions to which they have been exposed" (635-636). Although there are many dis- parities among the lists collected by different researchers in different times and places, Herskovits suggests that the remarkable similarities among them reveal the inner logic of "aboriginal African cultures" and the ways in which that logic had been used to form such a synthesis (643). THE PLACE OF THE SAINTS One of the first things one learns when one begins exploring Santeria is the correspondences between African Orisha and Roman Catholic saints. Obatala, the Orisha of clarity and purity, whose name means "king of the white cloth," is associated with the Virgen de la Merced (Sp. Virgin of Mercy), an aspect of the Virgin Mary who is dressed in white garments. Oshun, the Orisha of the river and fresh water, whose color is the golden hue of honey and who controls all that makes life worth living includ- ing love, marriage, children, money, and pleasure, is associated with the Virgen de la Caridcid del Cobre (Sp. Virgin of Charity of Cobre), who appeared, dressed in golden clothes, near the copper-mining town of Cobre in eastern Cuba. Ogun, the ironworker who is the patron of sur- geons, policemen, and soldiers, is associated with either St. Peter, who holds the keys to heaven, or St. George, the knight. Icons and symbols of the Catholic saints are seen as corresponding to the icons and symbols of the African Orisha so that the one represents the other to the devotee. The Orisha are multidimensional beings who represent the forces of nature, act as archetypes, and function as sacred patrons or "guardian angels." As knowable aspects of Olodumare, the so-called high god, they represent a level of power that is approachable though ritual action and so provide one very important focus for Yoruba religion (Lawson: 57). They have attributes and stories similar to those used to describe the an- cient Greek and Roman pantheons. However, unlike the Greek gods, the Orisha are not remote deities living high on a mountain peak; rather, they are living beings present in the everyday lives of their followers. It is around the Orisha that most Santeria religious activity focuses. For each deity there is an appropriate set of material symbols; for every object, concept, and action there is a ruling Orisha. The signification of the Orisha can be approached from either side of these statements: one</page><page sequence="6">26 Journal of the American Academy of Religion can choose an Orisha and attempt to determine all the material symbols associated with it. Or one can move through the physical and conceptual world associating an Orisha with each object found there. When the Yoruba began to reconstruct their religions in Cuba, they already had a rich system of symbols with which to work. While the wor- ship of some deities had been widespread and their cults widely recog- nized in Africa, others may have been less common. However, the basic system of signs and signifiers was already in place. Elements of their new environment could be easily integrated into their worldview without dis- rupting it. As David Brown suggests, many components of the Cuban landscape were reinterpreted and placed within an Africanized milieu (1989: especially chapters 5 and 6). New foods and manufactured items were also integrated into the symbolic system. In the same way the Catholic saints were appropriated as one more set of representations of the Orisha. Catholic saints may have provided a particularly rich addition to the sym- bolic language. The saints came with their own symbolic system that could be integrated (to a greater or lesser degree) into the existing African sys- tems. Although it often seems that a minor detail of the Catholic iconog- raphy is chosen (for example, Merced's white dress, Cobre's association with gold, Peter's metal keys, or George's sword and armor), some asso- ciations are more difficult to understand. It seems as though the founders of Santeria had an incomplete knowledge of the Christian symbol system, and thus often the correspondences between saint and Orisha are tenu- ous and perhaps even contradictory. For example, Shango, the lusty Orisha who represents male sexuality and kingliness, is associated with the virgin-martyr St. Barbara. A look at Barbara's iconography, which includes a white dress covered with a red martyr's tunic, the sword of her martyrdom, and the castle in which she was imprisoned, seems to sug- gest that color and accouterments were more significant than gender or sexuality.7 This view of Santeria as a synthesis of aboriginal African pat- terns and European traditions, including the relationship between the Orisha and Catholic saints, continues to inform both scholarly and popu- lar descriptions of this religion. TAKING ANOTHER LOOK This was the view I brought to my own research into the religious practices of Santeria. My research uses the altar displays built by practi- tioners as part of their religious practice as sacred texts that can be inter- 7 Red and white are Shango's colors. The sword and castle point to his role as king of the city of Oyo.

(There Are No Saints Here!) 27 rogated and analyzed to provide deeper insights into devotees' under- standing of their religion. When an adult education group at a local church asked me to present a series of classes based on my work, I wanted to in- clude a discussion of the construction of Santeria altars and the way these altars are a hybridization of the West African and Spanish forms of sa- cred space. Based on my own and others' research I wanted to put together a set of slides showing African, Spanish, and Santeria altars. I had planned on illustrating the way Catholic sacred personages, the saints, had been added to African altars that have few anthropomorphic images. But when I began to look for a picture of a Santeria altar "festooned with saints," as I was preparing to say in my talk, the only one I could find was the one in Brandon's work cited above (1993: 121).8 Among the Yoruba people of West Africa, religious altars have few an- thropomorphic figures, and those figures one does find on their altars are generally stylized or realistic representations of worshippers rather than figures of deities.9 Although many descriptions of Afro-Cuban altars of the Orisha suggest that Catholic saints and other European objects have invaded and perhaps even overwhelmed the purely African elements, my research has shown that in the contemporary North American context there are few anthropomorphic figures regularly found on these displays. The Houston Santeria community, for the most part, does not include Catholic statues on altars at all. This was not immediately surprising. Sev- eral reasons suggest themselves: (1) many members of the local commu- nity were not current or former Catholics; (2) although some Houston santeros (Sp. priests)10 have Catholic backgrounds, many of those have abandoned the Church and its iconography; (3) practitioners from Prot- estant backgrounds appeared to find saints even stranger than the Afri- can gods they were worshipping and are perhaps unlikely to look at them as appropriate representations of their new deities (Curry: 120, citing Brandon 1983: 186-187). I found, however, that photos from other sources also showed the absence of saints from Santeria displays (Brown 1993; Flores-Pefia and Evanchuk: 64-72; Mason 1997: 129 plate 211, 158 plate 263, passim; Th- ompson: 156 plate 175, 157 plate 176, 162 plate 183, passim). This en- s The other photograph of an altar display in Brandon's work contains only a single, albeit large, image of the Virgin of Regla (1993: 122). 9 Frobenius's early photography of a Shango shrine exemplifies this. In his description he notes the carved and painted columns that were sculptures of courtiers of the Orisha king, including "horsemen, men climbing trees, monkeys, women, gods, and all sorts of mythological carved work" (Pemberton: 166, quoting Frobenius, 1: 41). None of these figures was meant to be a representa- tion of the Orisha himself. 10 Initiated practitioners, the priests of Santeria, are called santero (male) or santera (female). Priests may be either male or female without distinction.</page><page sequence="8">28 Journal of the American Academy of Religion couraged me to look more closely at the local community. The absence of saints from domestic and birthday altars did not mean that the saints were entirely absent. In the homes of the more traditional Cubans there were saints, all the saints one is led to expect to find; they just weren't sharing space with the Orisha. For example, when I visited the home of a Cuban elder on the occasion of his religious birthday, I discovered that the fireplace in the living room had been filled in and the mantle converted into a shrine housing a three-fourth human-scale statue of the Virgen de Regla, who is associated with the Orisha Yemaya. But the birthday dis- play for the Orisha was in a back bedroom, completely separated from the Catholic-style display and completely devoid of Catholic religious fig- ures. The saints, including Regla, were in the public living room, while the Orisha had their own private room in the rear of the house." An excursion to New York City confirmed this insight. Through both personal observation and interviews with practitioners I discovered that Catholic saints tended to be decorative elements on domestic altars and were essentially absent from public displays. Several santeros told me that they had statues of saints in their homes but that they either were acquired after they became involved in the religion but before their full initiation into the priesthood or were gifts from others to them or their Orisha. Often these statues, while in the home of the santeros, were not in the altar spaces set aside for the Orisha. For example, one woman told me of a statue that she moved around her home; at the time, she told me, it was sitting on the land- ing of a staircase, again physically separated from her main altar display. Rather than statues, what we find on Orisha altars are two other types of objects. For each Orisha an individual santera/o worships she or he has a ceramic pot or other container housing the fundamentos (Sp. founda- tion, often translated as "tools") of the Orisha. Like the Catholic commun- ion wafer, these fundamentos are believed to be the embodiment of the Orisha themselves. (It is significant that part of the initiation into the priesthood is the creation of this set of Orisha god objects for the initiate.) Surrounding these pots is a myriad of other objects that represent the characteristics of these Orisha. These objects recall the myths and stories associated with the Orisha. They may be gifts given to the Orisha by the santera/o or her or his godchildren. Even when these objects are figures, they are not understood to represent the Orisha. One priest, an initiate of Ochosi, the hunter who is often represented by a bow and arrow, had a collection of Native American items including dolls, dream catchers, and the like along with an African-style spear. Another santero who was quite fond of wizards had wizard figures scattered about his shrine. Any num- " Mason suggests a similar organization in contemporary Cuba (1994: 242).</page><page sequence="9">Clark: iNo Hay Ningfin Santo Aqui! (There Are No Saints Here!) 29 ber of items may become associated with the Orisha and placed on altar displays. Yemaya initiates will often collect seashells and marine parapher- nalia, while a Shango priest might have a propensity for fire engines. In all these cases, the practitioner, her or his friends, and godchildren are interpreting their understanding of the Orisha to construct altars and shrines. But in all these cases, too, there is an understanding that these objects are decoration, put there for the enjoyment of the Orisha and the edification of viewers but nonessential in the deepest and truest sense. Altars can be constructed with only the fundamentos and their contain- ers; for rituals away from the home of the santera/o, the fundamentos them- selves may be removed from their pots and put in less fragile containers- plastic bowls and bags are popular. While the fundamentos are transported to the ritual site, the pots and other accoutrements are left behind. IDOLS AND FETISHES In spite of an aversion toward "idols," Christian-and particularly Catholic-religious spaces tend to house one or more anthropomorphic images: Christ on the cross, statues of saints, and so on. Early Christian churches and chapels were focused on actual bodily remains, the relics of the saints. According to William Christian, images were introduced into Spanish Christian practice in the eleventh and twelfth centuries (1981b: 21; Payne: 16). Although the official position of the Church forbade the "worship" of these images or the persons they represented, the boundary between the worship due to God and the veneration due to the saints has never been as clear to the people as it was to theologians. In any case, these images and relics were seen as vehicles for holiness; through ritual at- tention, such as prayer in front of a statue or touching the image, relic, or its container, devotees understood that they were brought closer to the godhead. When Europeans began to interact with the peoples of the West Coast of Africa, they developed a theory of idols and fetishes in an attempt to differentiate between their own practice of using images and the images and objects used by Africans. The word fetish (from the Portuguese word feitipo, meaning "an object or practice pertaining to witchcraft," and from the Latin factitius, meaning an object made by humans [Hackett: 141, quoting MacGaffey]) was used to describe the type of "wooden figure, leather amulet, gold necklace, stone, bone or feather, or potentially any inanimate material object" used or carried by the local people (Hackett: 141). These fetishes were often compared with the relics and statues of Catholic saints, especially in Protestant sources (Hair, Jones, and Law 1992a: 87, 1992b: 578, 638, for example).</page><page sequence="10">30 Journal of the American Academy of Religion However, when we look at West African imagery from its own perspec- tive, we find a different symbolic language. Not only are various types of objects considered to be the repository of sacred energy, but there seems to be a preference for the nonanthropomorphic. As I say earlier, Yoruba reli- gious altars are relatively devoid of anthropomorphic figures, and those figures one does find on altars are generally stylized or realistic representa- tions of worshippers rather than figures of deities. The anthropomorphic images do not represent the Orisha, gods or idols, but, rather, devotees. Human figures may represent famous priests who served the Orisha in the past, or they may be stylized representations of worshippers who exhibit the appropriate acts and gestures one should assume in the proximity of the divine. They may also represent offerings presented to the Orisha as part of a request or in thanksgiving for a blessing received. Bascom, for example, describes a conversation with an eighty-year-old priest in Nigeria: He pointed out the statue of a woman with a child on her back on his shrine to Yemoja and said that it was commissioned by his mother and given to the deity in gratitude for his own birth (1969: 111). We are to understand from this description that the statue represented the priest and his mother rather than the Orisha on whose altar it was displayed. Contemporary research- ers in Africa suggest that this use of figurative symbols was mistaken for idol worship by Christians and Muslims in Africa even though the practitioners differentiated between the figures and the divine being in whose presence we find them (Lawal: 34 n. 16). In many cases Santeria practitioners have even fewer human figures than are found on African religious displays. While one may find the oc- casional statue of a Catholic saint, dolls, or other figures such as Indian warriors or wizards here and there, in general human figures are absent from Santeria altars and shrines.12 In fact, even objects like Shango's osh., which in Africa incorporates a human figure, are often simplified and abstracted in the New World to eliminate any hint of a person.13 12 There are several exceptions to this general rule. Often, but not always, the Eleggua god object is in the form of a humanoid head; the Ibeji (Twins) always include two dolls as part of their fundamentos or tools; and Orisha Oko generally has a ploughman visible among his fundamentos. 13 The osh6 is the dance wand carried by priests of Shango, the great Orisha king, when they are under the influence of possession trance. It is one of the most widely recognized symbols of Shango in both Africa and the New World. Ranging from twelve to twenty-four inches high, the oshd is generally carved from wood. Almost universally, the shaft of an African oshe is carved in the form of a woman kneeling, standing, or offering a bowl with a baby at her breast or on her back. Over her head, embedded within her hair or as part of her hair itself, is the double-headed axe, the sym- bol associated with Shango. It is unlikely that this woman is intended to represent the Orisha Shango, who is a king and warrior, the very epitome of masculinity. Rather, her bulging eyes and reveren- tial body position suggest that she is a devotee in the state of possession, much like the male or female priest who would carry her image. In the New World the oshe generally has been simplified by the removal of the human figure to become a simple doubled-headed axe.</page><page sequence="11">Clark: iNo Hay Ningtin Santo Aqui! (There Are No Saints Here!) 31 To state it simply, contemporary Santeria altars have practically no human figures. Although I have seen little comment on this phenomenon, two theories present themselves: (1) the Orisha could never be adequately portrayed in a single image, thus no image is created (this may also be the explanation behind the biblical injunction against graven images); and/ or (2) because the Orisha are always already present on the altars of initi- ated santeros in the form of the fundamentos hidden in the pots, repre- sentations are not necessary. This second reason was actually offered to me by a iyawo (Y. wife, meaning "new initiate") in New York City. When I questioned him about the numbers and types of Catholic statues he had with his Orisha, he said that although he had quite a few statues in his home, they were not with his Orisha. Before his initiation he had acquired many of these statues, but because he now had "the Orisha themselves" he no longer had a need for other types of representations (personal com- munication, July 1998). LANGUAGE AND TRANSLATION But the saints are everywhere in the conversations between and among practitioners. Unless they are conscious of removing references to saints from their vocabulary (as many African American and some formerly Protestant practitioners are), discussions of the religion among practitio- ners are sprinkled with reference to the santos as well as to particular saints. If, as I have suggested, the Catholic saints are not important to the reli- gion, if they are merely one category in an infinite list of correspondences, why do we find them so conspicuously used in conversation? I would suggest that this is an example of sophisticated conceptual translation. Orisha religion has continually incorporated new signifiers into its chain of signification. New World products such as Indian corn (maize), sunflowers, and chocolate have been given Orisha correspondences (Shango, Oshun, and Oya, respectively). Because technological inno- vations are associated with Ogun, the Orisha of technology, we find such items as guns, railroad spikes, and automobiles associated with him in both Africa and the Americas. Among contemporary santeros either Ogun or Eleggua is associated with the computer, depending on whether they focus on its place as a technological innovation or as a communi- cation tool subject to the influence of the trickster. We find this same process at work during the colonial period. Deified forces of nature found in African weather and geography were redefined half a world away. African ideas of the appropriate ways to present the transcendent were interpreted into Santeria altar displays. Language, too, had to change.</page><page sequence="12">32 Journal of the American Academy of Religion We can suggest that it was important for Africans, particularly those living in the cities of colonial Cuba, to be able to express their ideas in the language of this new culture in which they found themselves. As they re- constituted their indigenous religions, they creolized their language usage. On the one hand, the founders of this religion kept their ancestral lan- guages for usage in deep ritual. Thus, the songs, prayers, and religious terminology continued in a form of the Yoruba language often called Lukumi. On the other hand, it would have been important to be able to express some of their religious concepts in the common language of their surroundings, that is, Spanish. The theories of M. M. Bakhtin suggest that individuals and groups can engage in two types of language usage: hybridization, a "mixture of two social languages within the limits of a single utterance" (358), and hetero- glossia, "another's speech in another's language" (324). Although all speak- ers use these techniques, it becomes particularly obvious in the case of bilingual speakers, who can switch not only between two social languages but also literally between two languages. I want to suggest that in their development of the religion we now call Santeria, African Orisha devo- tees engaged in both hybridization, that is, a mixture of several ritual and religious languages combined dialogically into a single ritual system, and heteroglossia, the use of Spanish terminology when speaking in a Span- ish environment. Thus, we find the use of a variety of African dialects as well as the use of Spanish (and now English) words. Not only could prac- titioners switch between languages and engage in hybridization, but when it became necessary they could hide forbidden religious discussions be- hind common words and phrases by using Spanish terminology to de- scribe Yoruba concepts (a sophisticated form of heteroglossia) (Bakhtin: 319-324, 358-360). But I want to suggest that more than simple dissimulation is going on here. I am suggesting that the Spanish terms used were not chosen arbi- trarily but are appropriate translations of Yoruba religious concepts. Translation is always difficult. One can never assume a complete transla- tion, and we are often left with the need for further exploration with our conversation partners. My own research has suggested that further explo- ration is needed in respect to the translation of several crucial terms used in Santeria, specifically the Spanish words santo and santero and the word Santeria itself. These terms are used not only in the literature but also among practitioners to connect the worship of African deities with the veneration of Catholic saints. Because of that connection, some Ameri- can practitioners in a quest to return to a more "authentic" Orisha reli- gion (Pinn: 86) have rejected them.</page><page sequence="13">Clark: iNo Hay Ningtin Santo Aqui! (There Are No Saints Here!) 33 Santo is generally translated "saint" and is said to refer to the Catholic saints that have been associated with the various Orisha. Santero is not normally translated but is used to describe a person who is a priest or a practitioner of the religion.4 Santeria is generally translated "the way of the saints" and refers to the religion itself. But casual conversations with practitioners raise questions about these translations. First I want to look in detail at the first of these words and suggest a different translation scheme. Then I will analyze possible alternative translations for the other two words as well."15 Santo in Spanish carries connotations beyond the facile translation of "saint," that is, a holy person canonized by the Catholic Church. Santo is not primarily a noun but an adjective meaning "holy, sacred, consecrated"; in respect to a person or other object it means "saintly" or "blessed." Thus, Holy Week is Semana Santa, the Holy Office or Inquisition is Santo Oficio, the Holy Ghost/Spirit is Espiritu Santo, and so forth. As a noun santo is trans- lated as "saint" and can be used as both a common and a proper noun, that is, as part of the name of a particular person, "Saint Barbara," or as a gen- eral noun, "my mother-in-law is a saint." The Orisha are not saints. They are not recognized by the Catholic Church, and many are anthropomor- phized natural phenomena rather than deified humans. But they are holy beings, revered as powerful, sacred, and divine. It was this connotation of holy and sacred rather than any particular connection with Catholic per- sonages that may have enticed the early Afro-Cubans to call their sacred beings santos, so that Orisha and santo become merely two translations, one Yoruba and the other Spanish, of the same religious concept. Conversations with santeros seem to validate this suggestion. They switch between the two forms indiscriminately-sometimes in midstate- ment. A recent article by Miguel Barnet, an acclaimed Cuban ethnogra- pher, poet, novelist, and short story writer, provides a telling example: "That is the function of the santos. Thus in santero ceremonies Olofi is seldom invoked (he is mentioned only briefly in a litany at the end), while the orishas are called on frequently. The theoretical difficulties aside, Santeria can dedicate itself entirely to the worship of the santos. They, in fact, govern as much the extrahuman cosmos as the fate of the people. Hence their extraordinary importance" (87, emphasis added). Barnet makes no distinction between santos and orishas in this passage; in fact, he uses the terms interchangeably. 14 Because as many as 80 percent of practitioners are also initiated priests, these two roles are often conflated. 15 I would like to thank Dr. Alice Wood, who first pointed out to me the wider connotations of santo and began my exploration of these terms.</page><page sequence="14">34 Journal of the American Academy of Religion While attempting to establish the place of statues of Catholic saints on the domestic altars of practitioners in New York City, I found that I had to be very careful in framing my questions. If I asked, "How many saints do you have on your throne/in your house/etc.?" santeros invari- ably started naming their Orisha. I had to specifically say "images of Catholic saints" to get the appropriate response. In Houston, in a dis- cussion with my own madrina (Sp. godmother), I pointed to an Orisha birthday altar saying, "See, there are no saints there." She looked at me in complete amazement. While I meant "statues of Catholic saints," she heard "Orisha" and could not understand how I could say such a thing! Within the Santeria context saint, santo, and Orisha function as three signifiers whose signified is a Yoruba deity, not any European sacred personage. Even the use of a particular saint's name is not meant to imply any inherently Catholic referent. The use of the name "Santo Lazaro/St. Lazarus" is a particularly potent example. The Orisha that is associated with this saint is called Babalu-Aiye in the New World. That is not his "real" name but merely a title, "Father of the World." Because he is the Orisha of smallpox, plague, and other infectious diseases, his name is seldom used so as not to invoke him indiscriminately. In Africa the people often use descriptors, titles, and euphemisms rather then saying his name. And in Cuba and the United States it is possible to go one step further. One can avoid not only his African name but also this nickname by always using the name of the saint associated with him. I have seldom heard anyone name this Orisha directly in conversation. He is almost always referred to as St. Lazarus.16 I would suggest that practitioners continue to confound researchers by their usage of these terms, and researchers confuse practitioners by attempting to make distinctions that do not actually exist. This is not to suggest that practitioners cannot distinguish between Catholic saints and the Orisha, merely that many of these conversations are based on a false dichotomy. Joseph Murphy provides an excellent example of this. After a long analysis of what he calls "'mosaic syncretism,' the juxtaposition of different cultural elements to form an integrated whole" (1993: 121-122, quoting Bastide), he says, "This distinction was made even clearer for me when I asked a senior santera in Philadelphia about the difference between 16 David Brown adheres to this form when he names the Orisha in one footnote as "Obatala, Yemaya, Chang6 and Och'in ... Oya or Agayd ... Olokun and St. Lazarus (Babalh Aye)" and in another as "Olokun, St. Lazarus, the Ibeyi (twins), Oricho-Oko, Obba, Oduia (Oduduwa) and Dadai" (1993: 85 n. 11, 25).</page><page sequence="15">Clark: iNo Hay Ningfin Santo Aqui! (There Are No Saints Here!) 35 the orishas and the saints. She thought about it carefully and answered, 'Los santos no comen,' 'The saints don't eat"' (1993: 124). Here the santera is distinguishing between the Orisha whose funda- mentos "eat" through the ritual of blood sacrifice and the Catholic ico- nography that is not included in these rituals. And while it is literally true that the Catholic images are never taken to ceremonies and ritually fed, at the same time it would be impossible to follow a conversation among santeros or Barnet's article quoted earlier if one continually made this sort of a distinction. Rather, the opposite is the case. In the absence of other contextual clues, one is better served to always assume that santo refers to an Orisha and not the literal Catholic saint, even if that saint is named. Having established that among practitioners santo generally refers to the Orisha, we can reexamine the related terms Santeria and santero. Although the most common translation of Santeria is "the way of the saints" (Murphy 1993: 2), there are a variety of reasons for disputing this. One can make a list of parallel terms, that is, nouns ending in -ria that do not mean "way of the ... ": abaceria means grocery store, the place to buy groceries; carniceria is butcher shop, the place to buy meat (Sp. came); fruteria is fruit shop, the place to buy fruit; panaderia is bakery, the place to buy bread (Sp. pan); and zapateria is shoe store, the place to buy shoes (Sp. zapatos). In parallel, we can suggest that one of the meanings of Santeria is the place where one goes to get or buy saints, that the religion of Santeria might be the place one may go to get "saints," that is, the Orisha.17 Further enlightenment is provided by an analysis of santero. Parallel terms to those listed above include abacero (grocer, seller of groceries), carnicero (butcher, cutter or seller of meat), frutero (fruit seller), panadero (baker, maker of bread), and zapatero (shoemaker, cobbler). By exten- sion, we could suggest that a santero is one who makes or sells saints/ Orisha. One of the most common names for the Santeria initiation cer- emony, hacer santo (Sp. to make saint), suggests we are on the right track (Murphy 1994: 93).18 A santero is not only one who makes saints. Both current and historic usage define a santero as a "person excessively devoted to the saints" (Smith: 658), one who may even be overly religious or superstitious (Alonso: 3709). And further exploration expands our understanding not 17 Collins Spanish-English English-Spanish Dictionary confirms this conclusion, defining Santeria as "shop selling religious images, prints, etc." (Smith: 658). 18 Again the Collins dictionary confirms our guess when it defines santero as "maker (or seller) of religious images, prints, etc." (Smith: 657). Mary Curry also translates Santeria as "the making of saints" (171 n. 3), "emphasizing," she says, "the system of initiation."</page><page sequence="16">36 Journal of the American Academy of Religion only of the term's current usage but also of its heritage. In Spain, accord- ing to William Christian, a santero is one who maintains a saint's shrine or is the member of a church fraternity (1972: 58, 1981b: 105, 107-108, 112; 1981a: figure 6 is a photo of one such santero). This leads us to sug- gest that although a santero may be overly devout, the basic definition is that he or she is one who "makes" saints, maintains a shrine, and may be a member of a religious fraternity-all of which could describe both nine- teenth- and twentieth-century practitioners of Santeria. An important element of our understanding of these terms is the notion that Orisha religious practice is tied to ideas of making and doing. Santeria is not so much a religion of belief as one of practice. One does not make a confession of faith to become active in the religion; rather, one begins to participate in rituals, showing increasing participation as various initiations both require and allow greater participation. The ini- tiation of a new santera/o includes the "making" of new fundamentos, as common objects are imbued with the sacred being of an Orisha. Although Santeria no longer refers to a shop where one might go to get the Orisha, it is only within the Santeria sphere of influence that one is able to acquire the Orisha and bring them into one's life. Our understanding of these ideas is expanded when we notice that in his analysis of nineteenth-century Yoruba religious usage, Peter McKenzie consistently uses the phrase "to make 6bris" to mean "to worship the dei- ties" (391, 479, passim). This seems to be based on the usage he found in the missionary record and is consistent with contemporary usage. The term se &amp;risi, which means "to make, do, or work the Orisha," is still used by Yoruba-speaking people in Nigeria to refer to their activities as Orisha worshippers. 19 All translation is tentative. However, the juxtaposition of the Yoruba idea that worship is bound up in activities of making and doing and the Spanish usage of santero as one who makes "saints" and Santeria as the place where "saints" are made expands our view of these terms. It is pos- sible, now, to suggest that the Spanish terminology may be a close approxi- mation of the Yoruba idiom, that it has nothing to do with Catholic prac- tice, and that these Spanish words may represent an attempt to express Yoruba ideas in a new language rather than an attempt to "hide" the re- ligion behind Christian terminology. Brandon's suggestion that early syn- cretistic practice was tolerated, even encouraged, by the Cuban Catholic hierarchy (1993: 70-74) further reinforces the theory that this terminol- ogy would have been in place before the repression of the cabildos (reli- gious brotherhoods) and the religions they housed. 19 My thanks go to William Muldro for helping me with this Yoruba terminology.</page><page sequence="17">Clark: iNo Hay Ninglin Santo Aqui! (There Are No Saints Here!) 37 SPIRITUALITY VERSUS SOMATICITY As early as 1950 William Bascom said that stones, blood, and herbs, rather than Catholic saints, were the focus of Cuban Santeria. He suggests that the chromolithographs and statues he found so prominently dis- played in the shrines and home of santeros were "empty ornaments or decorations, which may be dispensed with," that the real power of the santero lay in the fundamentos, the "stones" hidden from view. He was told that these stones contain the power of the Orisha, and he even goes so far as to suggest that the Cuban emphasis on these material elements was not due to a "coalescence of beliefs" but, rather, resulted from a focus on those "distinctive features of African religion ... which set Santeria apart from the ritual of the Church" (1950: 64-65). Bascom's suggestion that the religion was developed in opposition to rather than in association with Catholic beliefs and practices has never been fully explored. The practitioners, particularly priests, understand the difference between the Orisha who "eat" and the saints who do not at a deep level, in spite of confusing investigators by referring to the Orisha as santos. In an effort to clarify their terminology African Americans (and others) often choose to use only Yoruba or Lucumi (rather than Span- ish) terms, to exile statues from their altars, and to otherwise expunge Spanish and Catholic elements from their religious practices (Curry: 119- 121). As Bascom found, various cultural elements, including Catholic saints, can be dispensed with. However, what cannot be eliminated is what Bascom characterizes as "stones," the god objects that form the fundamentos of every Santeria altar. These "stones" represent the living presence of the Orisha on the Santeria altar. Like the consecrated host that Catholic doctrine deems the actual body of Christ, these "stones" are the Orisha.20 But many other items rep- resent the Orisha. Just as Catholics have crucifixes in their homes and churches to remind them of Jesus, santeros use a variety of anthropomor- phic and nonanthropomorphic objects to remind them of the Orisha. Each Orisha is associated with one or more colors, with particular animals, with certain fruits and other types of food, and with goods of various types- as well as with one or more Catholic saints. The concept of the Orisha is so broad as to include every object in the visible and invisible world; everything that exists or can be imagined can be given an Orisha cor- respondence by a knowledgeable practitioner. One can walk down the street or through the supermarket making correspondences with what- 20 The blood and herbs, along with human action, are what is required to turn common objects, the "stones," into Orisha fundamentos.</page><page sequence="18">38 Journal of the American Academy of Religion ever comes before one's eyes. Taking the last approach, one will discover that there is an infinite set of correspondences-every plant, animal, manufactured item, idea, natural phenomenon, place, and time can be associated with an Orisha. Something unique seems to be going on here. To put it simply, the Orisha are more likely to be represented by the nonhuman-plants, ani- mals, physical phenomena, even stones-than the human. Western philosophy sees the physical and material as the opposite of the sacred or the spiritual. Yet it seems that Orisha worshippers are work- ing from a different set of categories. Their use of "blood, herbs, and stones" as the focus of the religion to the detriment of human represen- tations suggests a system in which matter is set in opposition not to the spiritual but to the somatic, the human body-objects from nature and natural forces are seen as essentially sacred, whereas the human figure, whether Catholic saint or other representation, is merely decoration, one signifier in a long chain of such signifiers. In a system in which human activity imbues the material with the sacred, somaticity in and of itself seems to lack ultimate signification. It appears that the human form is not seen as closer to the divine than other types of objects. We might suggest that practitioners see natural (and, in some cases, manufactured) items as more appropriate forms for the creation of god objects than human figures. This preference for natural forms has continued to the present day. Those objects Bascom characterized as "stones" continue to be the preferred form in which to embody the Orisha. It appears that matter is valorized, while human and animal bodies are not. But within the context of Santeria (as well as its sister African-based religions) human bodies are sacred at one particular time and place, that is, during the trance possession event when the human body is infused with and becomes the deified Other. It is in the state of possession that the human body is finally seen as presenting the Orisha to the worship- ping community. Here we find the height of somaticity. Not only are the Orisha embodied, they use those human bodies to eat, drink, dance, speak, bless, and heal. During the duration of the possession event the body of the medium, the spirit host, is the living incarnation of a God. But human bodies, like the "stones," can only become the Orisha through ritual ac- tion. It is only after initiation, after the new priest has been "made" with blood and herbs, that she or he can endure possession and only in a ritual context, when, through the drumming and singing of the worshipping community, that the Orisha manifest in her or him. Thus we find Orisha embodied in natural phenomenon, in the "stones" that form the Orisha fundamentos, and in the bodies of their devotees. While Orisha may be found in a variety of objects, human bod-</page><page sequence="19">Clark: iNo Hay Ningmin Santo Aqui! (There Are No Saints Here!) 39 ies or their images do not form a privileged site of contact. In fact, out- side of the possession event, human bodies are less likely to function as sacred icons than other types of objects. These observations open in- teresting vistas for further exploration. Our philosophical and theologi- cal understandings change in an environment that valorizes the mate- rial while downplaying the human body. When the image of the human body is merely decoration, yet living humans can be literally possessed by the gods, we need new ways of categorizing materiality, spirituality, and somaticity.
