Scholarly discussion has focused on finding the historical kernel in these stories, or linking their creation to a particular event such as the official promulgation of an original or corrected Greek translation. The Letter of Aristeas is usually considered the most accurate version, in large part because it later was used as an introduction to the Septuagint. These discussions have overlooked the fact that in each case the basic plot is fine-tuned to suit each exegete's own ideas about how the Torah was written, how the text and its translation should be read and interpreted, and by whom. A comparison of the three versions reveals that each writer embellishes this bare-bones plot in a distinct manner. In par- ticular, "historical" details are created by each writer that support the very exegetical endeavor he is undertaking. The story of the translation becomes a vehicle for creating all the components necessary to justify the exegete's 'Opinions as to his date range from the late third to the early second century BCE. The fragments are preserved mainly in Eusebius's writings. The translations are taken from A. Yarbro Collins, "Aristobulus" in James H. Charlesworth, Old Testament Pseudepigrapha (2 vols.; Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1985) 2. 837-42. 2The text dates from the late second or early first century BCE.

Translations are based on Hadas. 3Philo's allegorical interpretations are much more extensive than those of Aristobulus and the author of the Letter. Of interest here is only Philo's version of the translation story (Vit. Mos. 2.25-44), as well as several comments he makes about his role as interpreter and Moses' role as author.

Comparing the three sto- ries gives us valuable insights into the self-perceptions of the exegetes and the emergence of what will become a standard model of text-author-exegete in Judaism. ARISTOBULUS Aristobulus's allegorical interpretations are presented, as best as can be discerned from the extant fragments, as dialogue. The explication of the holy text is caught in action in a dialogue between the author and a Ptole- maic king, presumed to be the questioner.4 In response to a question Aristobulus recounts the translation story in a few lines: It is evident that Plato imitated our legislation and that he had inves- tigated thoroughly each of the elements in it. For it had been translated by others before Demetrius Phalereus, before the conquests of Alexander and the Persians. The parts concerning the exodus of the Hebrews, our fellow countrymen, out of Egypt, the fame of all the things that hap- pened to them, the conquest of the land, and the detailed account of the entire legislation (were translated). So it is very clear that the philosopher mentioned above took many things (from it). For he was very learned, as was Pythagoras, who transferred many of our doc- trines and integrated them into his own system of beliefs. But the entire translation of all the (books) of the Law (was made) in the time of the king called Philadelphus, your ancestor. He brought greater zeal (to the task than his predecessors), while Demetrius Phalereus man- aged the undertaking. (Fragment 3, Eusebius Praep. Ev. 13.12.1-2) Aristobulus states that while there was a translation carried out under Ptolemy, this was not the only nor even the first translation. Other indi- viduals had translated parts of the history of the Hebrews. The Ptolemaic- sponsored version does not appear to have any special status in Aristobulus's eyes other than its royal sponsorship and execution with "greater zeal." Aristobulus would not want to stress the Ptolemaic translation because of another of his favorite themes: his belief that Jewish wisdom is the source 4Fragment 2 (Eusebius Praep. Ev. 8.10.1) begins "When, however, enough had been said in response to the questions set forth, you also, O King, exclaimed...." Similarly he refers to "the king called Philadelphus, your ancestor," at the start of Fragment 3 (Eusebius Praep. Ev. 13.12.2). 130</page><page sequence="3">NAOMI JANOWITZ of all ancient wisdom. In order to support this claim, he must argue that there was a means by which the Greeks, including Plato and Pythagoras, learned the content and message of the Hebrew writings. The Ptolemaic version thus becomes only one famous translation preceded by others. While this particular dialogue is a fantasy, royal patronage had been important to the Jews, from the Persian support for the temple documented in Ezra-Nehemiah to Antiochus III's subsidy of the temple known from Josephus.5 Aristobulus portrays the king as carrying on the interests of his "ancestor," and the close relationship between the king and the Jews is brought to the foreground. The king thus fills the double role of audience and patron, and everything good said about the text reflects back on him. Plato and Pythagoras are mentioned as part of the audience of the Jew- ish writings. Aristobulus states that in addition to the borrowings by phi- losophers, poets made use of Moses' writings and admired him accordingly (Fragment 2, Eusebius Praep. Ev. 8.10.4). These philosophers and poets were, presumably, forerunners of Aristobulus himself. Aristobulus, how- ever, has a special claim to interpret the text, because it is his text, the story of his people. In Fragment 4 (Eusebius Praep. Ev. 13.12.3) he writes, "Just so has Moses called the whole genesis of the world words of God in our Law. For he continually says in each case, 'And God spoke and it came to pass."' Here Aristobulus indicates that Moses is responsible for the wording not only of his own speeches, but of Genesis as well. The equation of the term Torah with five books written by Moses, beginning with creation and end- ing with his final speech and death, is surprisingly late in the history of Judaism; the issue is still ambiguous in the second century BCE.6 The idea of Moses' authorship was, according to Burton Mack, "strongly indebted to Greek literary practice and conceptuality."7 Implicit but not explicitly dis- 5The "Seleucid Charter" in Josephus Ant. 12.138-144. 6As Joseph Blenkinsopp notes (Wisdom and Law in the Old Testament and in Early Judaism [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1984] 11), the frequently used term "law of Moses" does not always refer to the five books as we have them now. Blenkinsopp states ". .. the Chronicler gives pride of place to 'the law of Moses.'. . . The frequent allusions which he makes to this law do not, however, necessarily point to the Pentateuch as we have it today." Indeed, he points out that the very usage of the word Torah to refer to a continuous narrative from creation to the death of Moses is "attested in early Christian writings and in Josephus... it occurs unequivocally no earlier than the second century BC." The only extant Jewish author who may have made this claim before Aristobulus is Eupolemus who stated that Moses invented writing and was the first to write down the laws (Eusebius Praep. Ev. 9.26.1). 7Burton L. Mack, "Under the Shadow of Moses: Authorship and Authority in Hellenistic Judaism," in SBLASP 21 (1982) 299-318, esp. 299. 131</page><page sequence="4">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW cussed by Mack or other scholars is the role exegetes played in the articu- lation of this picture of author and text. Here we see Aristobulus extending the standard Greco-Roman model of a divinely inspired philosopher to Moses and remaking Moses in the manner that Platonists remade Plato and Pythagoras, and Homeric exegetes Homer.8 The biblical story as Aristobulus recounts it includes an exodus, a con- quest, and legislation. It is also worth noting that Aristobulus does not use any shorthand titles or phrases to refer to the sections of the writings. He may well view the Torah story as one continuous historical narrative, simi- lar to the writings of Hecateus of Miletus. Aristobulus's claim that the text was a product of a divinely inspired individual goes hand in hand with the exegetical endeavor he undertakes; that is, in order to interpret and expound the meaning of the text, Aristobulus introduces the notion that behind the text there stands a divinely inspired transmitter who intends the text to be read in a certain way. The inspired individual speaks in a manner different from other humans, which is evi- dence of his elevated status. This accounts for the unusually complex, even cryptic, mode of expression that needs to be explicated in order to make sense to the reader. Thus Aristobulus's own role as exegete is legitimated. Aristobulus, in the role of interpreter, can now explain to the audience the meaning that the divinely inspired author meant to convey. He explic- itly states that if the audience, in this case the king, does not like the explanations he presents, the king should not blame the text. Instead the fault lies with the exegete, who failed to present the correct meaning. I shall begin then to interpret each thing signified in turn, to the extent that I am able. But if I miss that point or fail to be persuasive, at- tribute the lack of reason not to the lawgiver but to my inability to interpret his thoughts. (Fragment 2, Eusebius Praep. Ev. 8.10.6) The exegete's humble language, emphasizing his fallibility, draws atten- tion away from the dramatic fact that he claims to be able to tell what the text does and does not mean. In the extant fragments, the basis for Aristobulus's authority to interpret the text is never directly explained.9 The particular stumbling block in reading the Hebrew texts is the seem- ingly anthropomorphic language used to describe the deity. A reader, for 8"Therefore, those who are able to think well marvel at his [Moses'] wisdom and at the divine spirit in accordance with which he has been proclaimed as a prophet also." (Fragment 2, Eusebius Praep. Ev. 8.10.4). 9Aristeas and Philo imply or state specific claims about the authority of the exegete. 132</page><page sequence="5">NAOMI JANOWITZ example, might erroneously read the word hand and think that the deity has hands.10 Aristobulus explains that the word is used as a metaphor, and that the author was referring to the majesty of the deity.1l He supports his interpretation by drawing an analogy to the king's own mode of discourse; the king, like the deity, uses language of the royal circles, a parallel that must be particularly persuasive when addressing a king. A correct reading of the text involves what we would call a sociolinguistic distinction; the same words used in different social settings have different meanings. Again, the principle must be understood first in order to understand the text. Aristobulus's interpretive repertoire includes a variety of specific ex- egetical moves. As mentioned above, he explains that the author used a special type of language. In this regal language, "standing" signifies "pres- ence," and "fire" signifies "divine control over nature" (Fragment 2, Eusebius Praep. Ev. 8.10.9-17). He also explains that the language of the text may talk about the deity in order to state something about the world. The ref- erence to God's voice does not mean he in fact has a voice, but instead is about the "establishment of things" (Fragment 4, Eusebius Praep. Ev. 13.12.3-8). The seventh day was chosen as a day of rest in order to com- memorate the seventh sense, which is reason (Fragment 4, Eusebius Praep. Ev. 13.12.3-8). Thus the use of the word seven in the creation story stands as a metaphor for one of the human capacities. These interpretive moves are based on an additional exegetical principle; Aristobulus uses Prov 8:22 to prove that wisdom existed before the cre- ation of heaven and earth (Fragment 5, Eusebius Praep. Ev. 13.12.9-16). The Torah is a manifestation of this wisdom, which by definition, or one could say historical coup, belongs to the Jews. The allegorical system of Aristobulus has several components, including a divine transmitter behind the text (Moses), the need for an exegete to uncover the true meaning, and the idea that the text is a source of ancient, universal wisdom. These ideas will become standard tropes in later inter- pretations of the Bible, including rabbinic and Christian exegesis. ARISTEAS Aristeas's version of the story is the most famous, surviving as an ad- dendum to the Septuagint.12 The author of the Letter of Aristeas finds in l?This does not prove that Aristobulus was writing an apologetic for Greek audiences. The question of the appropriateness of bodily descriptions of the deity was hotly debated among Jews for centuries. 1Aristobulus uses the verb "getaxkpco" (Fragment 2, Eusebius Praep. Ev. 8.10.8-9). '2The earliest printed version of the Letter of Aristeas appeared as part of the first Latin Bible. Cf. Sidney Jellicoe, The Septuagint and Modern Study (Oxford: Clarendon, 1968). 133</page><page sequence="6">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW the story of a Ptolemaic-sponsored translation an excuse to write a lengthy treatise about Judaism. While the Letter of Aristeas is best known for the translation story, it also includes (1) a series of official documents about the freeing of Jewish slaves by the king, (2) extensive descriptions of vessels and other cultic objects sent by the king to the high priest, (3) a long description of the Judaean countryside and the Jerusalem sacrificial cult, (4) allegories attributed to the high priest, and (5) a banquet scene in which the king asks the seventy-two translators a series of philosophical ques- tions. If Aristobulus made a dramatic claim about Hebrew wisdom, placing it at the center of all ancient wisdom, the author of the Letter of Aristeas was more circumspect in his claims. He, in fact, states the opposite; according to Aristeas, the Ptolemaic-sponsored translation was the first. The dilemma that motivates this author is his recognition that the Jewish writings are not very well known. He explains that the writings are not better known due to the deity's opposition to previous attempts at translation. When the king asks Demetrius why other individuals have not made use of the "intellect of the lawgiver," Demetrius explains that some persons had tried to do so but were struck with "a derangement of the mind" or a cataract (Ep. Arist. 312-16). While Aristeas's depiction of the lack of prior translation may at first glance appear to be more historical than Aristobulus's wildly Judeo- centric notions, the evidence Aristeas calls on (divine injunctions against translation) demonstrates that the authors simply have two different prob- lems on their hands and will use whatever strategies they can to support their version of the story. The section actually describing the translation is brief, intertwining ref- erences to the process of translation with descriptions of the site on which it was carried out and other short comments. Demetrius. . . called upon the men to carry out the business of trans- lation, all necessary appliances having been well provided. And so they proceeded to carry it out, making all details harmonize by mutual comparisons. The appropriate result of the harmonization was reduced to writing under the direction of Demetrius. (Ep. Arist. 301-2) When they had washed their hands in the sea, as is the custom of all Jews, and had offered prayer to God, they addressed themselves to the interpretation and clarification of each passage. (Ep. Arist. 305) The translators carry out their work with divine sanction but without divine aid. They compare their translation efforts and compile the best translation, a very human endeavor. Several scholars have commented on 134</page><page sequence="7">NAOMI JANOWITZ the author's mundane theory of translation; Werner Schwarz calls it "philo- logical."13 The author of the Letter presents this simple method of transla- tion because Aristeas does not expend much effort in analyzing or exegeting the specific wording of the Greek text.14 The translators give the king not only the translated text, but also pro- vide a summary of the main components of the Jewish religion, which ends up occupying much more space than the translation story (Ep. Arist. 182- 300). Their guidebook to Jewish philosophy and beliefs is cast as a dia- logue between the king and the translators in which the translators explain point by point everything an educated person might want to know about Judaism. Presumably their philosophical knowledge gives them authority to translate the text and, more importantly, to explain the meanings of Jewish beliefs. Unlike Aristobulus's answers in a similar banquet setting, the trans- lators do not cite any biblical texts. They present philosophical discussions, grounding the points they make in the language of philosophical discourse and not in textual citations. Aristeas constructs a philosophical portrayal of Judaism not by shaping Moses in the image of a philosopher but by making the Jewish text experts into philosophers. These text experts do not how- ever need to cite the text; they can express its central ideas in other words ("translations") than those used in the original text. Not only does the physical text come from the Holy Land, brought by the translators, but the methods for reading it derive from the Holy Land as well. That is, the only examples of specific exegesis of biblical texts are put in the mouth of the high priest, who explains several Jewish rituals. In part this is due to the demands of plot. Aristeas cannot himself present the allegories, for according to the plot he is one of the questioners, and not himself an authority on Judaism. The rituals must be explained by a ritual specialist. It is the high priest, the central authority figure for the entire cult, who engages in the discourse.15 As would be expected of a high priest, he discusses texts about ritual actions, as for example, All the regulations concerning what is permissible with reference to these and other creatures, then, he has set forth by way of allegory (TponoXoy6v). For the "parting of the hoof" and the "cloven hoof' '3Werner Schwarz (Principles and Problems of Biblical Translation [Cambridge: Cam- bridge University Press, 1955] 17-44) includes an interesting discussion of later Christian writers who have similar ideas about the method of translation used to produce the Septuagint. 14It will be up to Philo, who does concern himself with the details of the Greek text, to extend its inspiration model to the translators. '5One of the often-noted internal contradictions of the Letter is that the high priest can cite the Greek text before the translation has taken place. 135</page><page sequence="8">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW is a symbol to discriminate in each of our actions with a view to what is right; for the strength of the whole body and its energy depend upon the shoulders and legs. He constrains us, by taking note through these symbols, to do all things with discrimination and with a view to righ- teousness. (Ep. Arist. 150-51) These actions are not arbitrary or based on whim; each call to a particular action reflects a moral principle. Parting the hoof and chewing the cud signify memory. In particular, following this action leads an individual to recall the great actions the deity did for them. The high priest supplies a similar explanation for food laws, arguing that "so that we should be polluted by none nor be infected with perversions by associating with worthless persons, he has hedged us about on all sides with prescribed purifications in matters of food and drink and touch and hearing and sight" (Ep. Arist. 142). Purity leads to better contemplation of the deity and a holy life in general, not to ritual cleanliness. By explaining these citations, he is substituting a new basis for ritual behavior and thus reinterpreting those very rituals. The extent to which the rituals are "trans- lated" is masked by the high priest's use of citations from the text.16 Hand washing is the only ritual explained by the translators, and the point of view expressed intersects with that of the high priest. They answer Aristeas's query about the reason for this practice by stating "it was in witness that they had done no wrong, since the hands are the organs of all activity" (Ep. Arist. 306). For Aristobulus, "hand" is a metaphor for maj- esty. For Aristeas, washing hands is a metaphor for pure and clean living; the "innocence" of clean hands is an analogy for the "innocence" of righ- teousness and truth. This stance represents a new notion of the sphere of influence of the distinction between pure and impure. That is, one does not remain pure in order to participate in the cult but in order to lead a good life. The author of the Letter, again like Aristobulus, makes more than one kind of interpretative move. He recasts the biblical motifs of king, land, and cult by means of his narrative portrayal of these elements. He "trans- lates" the figure of the king to a more contemporary understanding by presenting a foreign king who acts as solicitously toward the Jews as the best native king had, freeing Jewish slaves and supporting the Jewish cult. Jerusalem is described as a utopia where clean and unclean walk on oppo- 16This is not necessarily an apologetic move; new interpretations of rituals are constantly supplied in the history of Judaism, and the renewed understandings permit continued obser- vance. 136</page><page sequence="9">NAOMI JANOWITZ site sides of the street. As a far-off holy place where purity laws structure daily life, the Holy Land is relegated to the nostalgic position of a never- never homeland. The king sends vessels to the cult in Jerusalem, gifts that emphasize the aesthetic dimension of the religious practices. The details of their construction "translate" the cultic actions into aesthetic feats, estab- lishing a new basis for understanding cultic actions as in the description of food laws.17 The author begins with certain presumptions about the goals of the law- giver on which he bases his exegesis.18 The lawgiver was concerned with certain principles, such as justice, a presumption shared by Aristobulus.19 Since questions of justice underlie the author's work, it must therefore be a guiding principle in interpretation. The high priest explains that the Jew- ish writings could be read using the "base notion"20 that Moses cared about animals, but that would be the fault of the reader and would fail to take into consideration the lawgiver's concern for justice. Moder interpretation of the Letter has been skewed by the uses to which the story was put in the ancient world. As Sidney Jellicoe writes, "That Aristeas was written to furnish an historical account of the 'official' Greek edition of the Torah goes back at least to Philo."21 The many ancient writers who cited the Letter were only interested in the part of the Letter that told about the translation. Moder scholars often repeated this interpre- tation.22 Despite the fact that the author of the Letter uses the translation story as the thread with which to tie together his narrative, the emphasis of the Letter is not on allegorical interpretations or any other theme that high- lights the specific wording of the Greek. Instead he presents a very general "translation" of the central tenets of Judaism, most of which is done using narrative. Because the author of the Letter does not see himself primarily as a word-by-word textual exegete, the figures in the story who come closest to mimicking his role are the translators when they discuss the essence of their religion with the king. Again, their rhetorical stance as translators reinforces the author of the Letter's own role as someone who was simply 17See also Janowitz, "Translating Cult," 355-56. 8Moses is mentioned only once by name in Ep. Arist. 144. 19For a similar reference to justice in Aristobulus see Fragment 4, Eusebius Praep. Ev. 13.12.8. 20Hadas translates the phrase as "exploded idea" (Kaaotextlcoxcoa kdyov). 21Sidney Jellicoe, "The Occasion and Purpose of the Letter of Aristeas: A Re-examina- tion," NTS 12 (1966) 144. 22A major exception is Avigdor Tcherikover, "The Ideology of the Letter of Aristeas," HTR 51(1958) 59-85. 137</page><page sequence="10">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW stating what the original text said. The rhetorical strategy of the Letter is so successful that it led to the dismissing of much of the content of the Letter historically and convinced readers it is really about the original text. As we will now see, Philo helped in this process. PHILO Philo, who supplies us with a third version of the story, was heir to a rich and already well-developed history of allegorical interpretation with a range of exegetical techniques.23 He recounts the familiar story of the trans- lation as part of his writings about Moses (Vit. Mos. 2.25-44). Philo's version is much shorter than Aristeas's and focuses on details of the trans- lation process. This part of the earlier story is embellished with several new twists and pays closer attention to the production of the Greek version. Fully one-fifth of Philo's comments stress the miraculous nature of the translation. For Philo the issue of previous translation is moot. He does not state that there were other translations because from his point of view one divine translation is enough. Aristeas fails to mention Moses. Philo also does not mention Moses in the story itself, but uses the story as part of his general argument for the perfection of Moses. This is done simply by putting the story in the middle of his De vita Mosis. Philo's transition is the greatness of the laws, dem- onstrated by the fact that foreign nations embrace them (for example, sabbath, fasting). The annual feast to celebrate the occasion of the translation also demonstrates that "the laws are shewn to be desirable and precious in the eyes of all, ordinary citizens and rulers alike" (Vit. Mos. 2.43). This time the translators "became as it were possessed, and, under inspi- ration, wrote, not each several scribe something different, but the same word for word, as though dictated to each by an invisible prompter" (Vit. Mos. 2.37). Philo admits that it might be possible to use a variety of Greek phrases in translation, but the ones chosen by the translators correspond "literally" (Kclptov Ovogca) with the Hebrew. Philo adduces "exact" paral- lels within geometry and logic as a model for the translator who "arrived at a wording which corresponds with the matter, and alone, or better than any other" (Vit. Mos. 2.39). Still not satisfied, Philo continues, stating that if any individual knew both languages and read both texts, he would find 23J. Dillon ("The Formal Structure of Philo's Allegories," in David Winston and idem, eds., Two Treatises of Philo of Alexandria [BJS 25; Chico, CA: Scholars Press, 1983] 82) states that the solitary evidence of Aristobulus is not sufficient evidence to posit a long tradition of allegorical interpretation prior to Philo. He does not mention the fragmentary evidence of other early Jewish exegetes or the Letter of Aristeas. 138</page><page sequence="11">NAOMI JANOWITZ that they are "one and the same" (Vit. Mos. 2.40). The workers are not merely translators but "prophets and priests of the mysteries" who go "hand in hand with the purest of spirits, the spirit of Moses" (Vit. Mos. 2.40). For Philo, who will extensively interpret the specific wording of the holy writings, each word of the Greek text must have the same meaning as the Hebrew text. The translators work not by comparing results and harmo- nizing as in the Letter, but instead are guided by the holy spirit. As part of the same strategy, Philo does not leave Moses' role in doubt. Elsewhere he states that the holy spirit worked directly on Moses' vocal chords (Spec. leg. 4.49; Rer. div. her. 263-66) in forming the original writings.24 Moses is a divinely inspired author and even the translation is divinely inspired. Philo, as interpreter, is the last link in the chain of interpretation. He cannot present himself as high priest, the device used to establish au- thority in the Letter. Instead he states that he is also divinely inspired; he was even initiated into the mysteries by Jeremiah (Cher. 49). The same spirit that moved Moses' vocal chords leads Philo's mind in its exegetical endeavors. Is Philo's exegetical model new? He works with the same basic model found in Aristobulus, but has developed it extensively. For the earlier ex- egete, Moses was divinely inspired, composed the wording of the holy writings, and used a special kind of language to convey his meanings. Philo extends the divine inspiration model, uses common ideas of authorship and inspiration to support the Greek version, and articulates in detail Moses' role as author, expanding it as needed. From the exegete's point of view, claiming that the text has an author permits and also masks the creation of two texts (what the author wrote versus what the author meant). As far as we can tell from Aristobulus's fragments, he never made all the particular claims made by Philo, nor did the author of the Letter. Philo has taken the earlier model and pushed it to its limit. For the Jewish exegetes, as for their Greek counterparts, meaning is not unitary and simple. The individual who composed the texts used special kinds of language, easily misunderstood by readers, and it is the preroga- tive and duty of the exegete to explain that language to us. 24Philo articulates his portrait of Moses as author, arguing, for example, that he rejected myth. The purpose of this claim is to differentiate Moses' stories from similar-sounding stories. Moses' story about giants is not to be confused with Greek stories about giants. Moses, Philo argues, used the myth-like language because of the intended audience of his writings. Some of those for whom the text was written can only be addressed by using such myths. Like Aristobulus, Philo introduces a sociolinguistic notion; an author must take his audience into consideration if he wants to be understood. 139</page><page sequence="12">140 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW The mode of interpretation is motivated by the author's sheer and total brilliance. Most readers, being mere mortals, will have to struggle to un- derstand the text. These cryptic writings demand considerable exegesis. The author may have used a special kind of language-the language of majesty, which the king also uses-in order to express the majesty of the subject about which he writes. The exegete must then point out that the very choice of royal language is itself part of the message. The claim that Moses wrote the Torah appears to fill the need for an inspired author, whose meanings are the meanings of the contemporary exegete. The exegete must himself have special talents, for "just as poets followed no rational principles, interpreters must be inspired" (Plato Ion 533d). Each exegete supports his interpretations by whatever means he can, believing that his new text of interpretations conveys the same truths as the original, only better. Seeking only for the "historical" kernel of these writ- ers not only misleads us on the history of the Septuagint but also misses the richness of these authors' self-presentations.</page></plain_text>
