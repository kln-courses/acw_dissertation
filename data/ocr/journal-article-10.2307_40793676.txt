<plain_text><page sequence="1">Problems in Documenting the Kapkap: Unravelling Pattern in Melanesia1 Graeme Were Department of Anthropology, University College London Introduction: problems of provenance Amongst almost every display of South Pacific art in Western museums lies the seemingly ubiquitous kapkap, a finely decorated shell ornament, whose provenance spans not merely Melanesia but its Polynesian neighbours. 'Kapkap', a Melanesian pidgin term to describe a body ornament, is worn around the neck or on the forehead, usually during times of high sociality. Characterised by an intricate geometric pattern carved in tortoiseshell (though more accurately the ventral plate of a turtle), a white clam shell disc is attached to this in such a way that the ornament induces the effect of drawing a viewer's attention to it. The kapkap appears in many visual forms, and glossy picture books on South Pacific artworks confirm this view. So well-known is the ornament that Pacific art books tend to classify almost any patterned shell body ornament as such. The uhikana of the Marquesas Islands in Polynesia, the tema of Santa Cruz Islands, the ulute from San Christobal, and patterned shell ornaments from the Torres Strait : all have appeared in Pacific art texts under the generic term kapkap. Documenting such a well-known artefact as the kapkap is problematic for two important reasons. Firstly, museum and ethnographic records say very little about kapkaps even though a vast collection exists in Western museums. Data usually comprises of collector, year of acquisition, general provenance (such as New Ireland or Solomon Islands) and dimensions. In a recent research trip around European and American museums, I counted over 500 kapkaps shared among 13 museums. Only about 5 per cent of kapkaps included information relating to place of manufacture and place of acquisition. Most documentation contained little or no historical information whatsoever. Surprisingly museum curators have simply relied on functional explanations to explicate the object as an ornament whilst anthropologists have ignored the conceptual aspects of patterning. Museum labels tend to display captions like 'body decoration', 'worn after initiation', 'clan badge' or more commonly absolutely nothing. Anthropological approaches have typically focused on four theoretical domains. The diffusionist approach attributes Chinese and south east Asian influences to the tortoiseshell pattern (Ross 1981; Schuster 1964), whilst the symbolic approach attaches meaning to the motifs incorporated within the pattern (Schuster 1964). Reichard's (1933) study of wood and tortoiseshell carving focuses on stylistic pluralism in Melanesia, documenting the distribution and possible origins of styles in relation to kapkap patterns and wooden ceremonial bowl design. Finally, Pacific art books typify the aesthetic approach, commenting on the brilliance of the ornament and its affect on the Western eye. 94 Journal of Museum Ethnography 2001</page><page sequence="2">Problems in Documenting the Kapkap ^N. % * * *«W Λ NEW f/S^W&lt;Vv BISMARCK NSw* crowds Χ C ^ s&lt;jl«mok Χ &gt;λ| «/ΐ5ΊΧΑ!τ - ^O"^^ C **· ^^ Λ «/ΐ5ΊΧΑ!τ ^ Ρ/αίβ 7. Map of area under discussion2 The second problem is the classifications of the kapkap by correlating pattern form to geographic region and/or cultural group. The affinity between pattern and social boundaries does not exist for all kapkap pattern forms. This is particularly evident in the Bismarck Archipelago2 and the Solomon Islands: pattern cannot be clearly differentiated by island or geographic region. Kapkaps are traded inter- and intra-islands, in a similar way to the kula of the Trobriand Islands. Whereas it is the 'fame' of the kula shell that projects owners' renown across island groups (Munn 1986), transactions involving kapkap patterns are common throughout the region, possibly as a means of extending social networks throughout the archipelago of islands. Ethnographic data suggests that a healthy trade in shell ornaments has existed throughout New Ireland, the Admiralty Islands and the Solomons, and studies of material culture in the Bismarck Archipelago closely associate patterns with personhood and identity (see Küchler 1991 and Wilkinson 1973 on malangan sculptures of New Ireland). However, producing a biography of each kapkap would prove difficult since ethnographic data is rare and is compounded by the fact that they remain within lineages, they are traded and exchanged for decades and the tortoiseshell patterns are repaired by indigenous persons for re-use. This makes dating and tracing the origins of particular kapkap patterns an extremely difficult process since they have been around for ages. In fact little is known about the production of kapkaps. Valuable data on who produces what patterns, where and why is rare.3 Studies to date merely confirm what we already suspect, that is the historical contact between various cultural groups. Evidence of this is in the scattering of objects through exchange or in this case, the entangling of pattern. In his topographic account of the Australia Museum's collection of kapkaps, Journal of Museum Ethnography 2001 95</page><page sequence="3">Graeme Were Plate 1. Bismarck Archipelago featuring central petal motif, four eye motifs, double line motif with surrounding tiling and tooth-edge motifs. McCarthy (1946) is a typical victim of the desire to fit pattern form to an island group even though representative museum collections contradict this view. He defines the Admiralty Island kapkap as exhibiting radial symmetry typified by a pattern divided into four quadrants each with identical motifs. New Ireland kapkaps on the other hand have concentric form where the pattern emanates from a central flower or star motif. However, on researching the Admiralty Island collection of kapkaps in the Field Museum Chicago, I counted over 30 kapkaps that McCarthy defined as those of New Ireland. Therefore, there exists a tendency to unravel the complexity of pattern form for a region through a process of exclusion and inclusion based on preconceived ideas of 'the original form of pattern'. How many indigenous voices have substantiated Western claims? The error is perpetuated in museum documentation. Conflicting opinions between collector, dealer and curator are evinced in museum records. Documents at the Staatliches Museum fur Völkerkunde in Dresden, Germany show that one curator retrospectively re-labelled provenances of Admiralty Island kapkaps collected in 1902 believing that they were from New Ireland. Another kapkap in the Horniman Museum, London, has two different island provenances written on the reverse of the clam shell (New Britain and New Ireland) and Santa Cruz written on the catalogue card. Only Alfred Bühler' s collection of kapkaps in Basel has documentation referring to the villages where he purchased his kapkaps. But we still have no information as to the origin of the ornament except in about 5 per cent of the kapkaps so far documented. Reichard (1933: 8, 88) clearly acknowledges that the provenance indicated by museum records is problematic. She states that in order to carry out her analysis of over 300 kapkaps residing in Western museums she did not rely purely on museum documentation: 'Except in a few cases their true provenience [sic] is as clearly marked by the style as if it were written on them' (1933: 88). In fact, Reichard states that in most cases she dispenses with the original museum documentation calling the accompanying data of 'pseudo-provenance' (1933: 8). She feels compelled to iron out variation in form of kapkap patterns by putting intra-regional differences down to trade and bad documentation by collectors, blaming the latter on whalers and sea captains who 'could hardly expect ... to know the difference between the Solomon and New Ireland treatment of line, or the use of triangles in the Carolines and in New Britain' (1933: 8). Rather she is happy to rely on her own ideas of what New Ireland and Admiralty Island pattern form originally constituted. Moreover she goes on to say that South Pacific art dealers were renowned for 96 Journal of Museum Ethnography 2001</page><page sequence="4">Problems in Documenting the Kapkap picking-and-mixing tortoiseshell patterns with clam shell discs so as to get the best looking kapkaps for sale to Western collectors (1933: 91). Therefore, taking this information into account, kapkaps bought from Pacific art dealers must be of dubious provenance if they have been tampered with to suit Western demands. Reichard' s assertion of regions of fixed form must therefore be based on an ideological vision of immutable objects. Looking at pattern within the Bismarck Archipelago and the Solomons as an eclectic but bounded4 flow of images rather than static, homogenised entities, this paper attempts to reconceptualise kapkap patterns as psychological processes rather than as a classification of form. Focusing on spatial application of pattern Plate 3. Bismarck Archipelago kapkap with central cross motif, double line motif, tiling and tooth-edging around circumference. as an indigenous knowledge system, it shows that pattern is a complex array of inter- connected elements traversing spatial and temporal boundaries. This paper sets out to investigate systems of order in the way motifs are arranged within the concentric bands. If we can ascertain types of pattern generation through a museum ethnography of kapkaps, then any conceptual structures coherent to the patterns can be fruitfully combined with subsequent anthropological fieldwork. By applying a mathematical analysis to the patterns, I aim to give a methodological overview to show there are preferential choices by the carver in the spatial application of motifs within the concentric bands. Beginning in general with Melanesia, I will define the pattern form of various types of kapkap found in museum collections in the west before moving onto the problematics of classifying form in the Bismarck Archipelago and the Solomons. Regions of pattern form: some outline definitions Four main regions of kapkap production exist in Melanesia: the north coast of Papua New Guinea, the Papuan Gulf region, the Solomon Islands and the Bismarck Archipelago (as already defined). There are three main pattern forms which do not permeate areas that produce their own kapkap patterns. The north coast of Papua New Guinea, the Papuan Gulf and a particular type of kapkap in the Admiralty Islands have clearly definable kapkaps due to distinct shape and pattern. The north coast of Papua New Guinea: Elliptical in shape and made of conus shell rather than clam shell, the Ramu River and Sepik River kapkaps are worn in the hair with a wooden pin by local men. The pattern is typified by elliptical anthropomorphic designs5. Triangles with tooth-edging are common motifs for the north coast patterns. Journal of Museum Ethnography 2001 9 7</page><page sequence="5">Graeme Were The Papuan Gulf: In the Papuan Gulf region, the shell disc is made of the greyish baler shell and slightly concave. The pattern is segmented, divided into usually four but sometimes three sectors. A chevron motif radiates from the centre, but the characteristic star design of the Bismarck Archipelago and Solomons is absent. The inner chevron design is bordered on the edge by a tooth-edge outer design. Called heohae in Western Elema dialect, the kapkap measures from 40-110 millimetres in diameter which is small compared to other kapkaps in Melanesia. Worn around the head, McCarthy (1946: 86) states: These Papuan kapkaps are only worn by the initiated men who had, in the old days, secured the head of an enemy, but the latter qualification is now no longer required. The exact position of the kapkap on the head-dress is important, and the various designs are thought to be the property of clans. These kapkaps are also worn on special occasions by girls who have undergone their puberty rites. Unfortunately McCarthy is unable to provide any further data on the link with positioning of the kapkap on the head or the link with puberty rites. The Papuan Gulf kapkap is always owned by a man but sometimes lent to a woman to be worn6 (Leenhardt 1950: 73). Reichard (1933: 89) adds that Roro men of the Papuan Gulf ceremonially attach the kapkap to a headdress only after an initiation ceremony engendered by a homicide. Seligmann (1910) states that the Mekeo kapkap, kefe, is worn in combination with others on an elaborate head-dress. Position is intrinsic to meaning. The Bismarck Archipelago and the Solomons: Although the patterning on the kapkap of the Bismarck Archipelago and the Solomons is problematic, there exists a Plate 2. Bismarck Archipelago kapkap featuring central star motif, with single line motif tiling and tooth-edge motif with filled triangle. distinct type of pattern form that museum documentation confines to the Admiralty Islands. There are also kapkap patterns from the Solomon Islands based on concentric bands and a central motif that incorporates a unique motif only found in this specific geographic area. The Admiralty Islands: The kapkap of the Admiralty Islands sometimes has incised chevron motifs along the circumference of the clam shell. There is very little evidence relating to the use of the kapkap in this region except that they are worn as breast ornaments hung from string or a length of beads. The Admiralty Island kapkaps are made of clam shell with tortoiseshell overlay. The average diameter of the ornament is between 90-120 millimetres. The tortoiseshell patterning unique to this region is a radial design, 98 Journal of Museum Ethnography 2001</page><page sequence="6">Problems in Documenting the Kapkap divided into, most commonly, four sectors. Motifs run from the centre to the circumference of the pattern. A large incorporation of motifs is repeated in each sector and around the edges of the tortoiseshell overlay. Motifs include lozenge shaped designs, triangular shapes, crescents and tooth-edge motifs. These motifs are repeated on other material artefacts of the region, typically wooden ceremonial bowls and gourd pots. ^SZS^t &lt;$3^d i^^T" -g^^· ^jn^$ -$£££$ *ρ2Ζφ ^B^: 35^2: Plate 4. Corpus of motifs. From top left to bottom right: triangle (not filled), tile, line (single), chain, ball, wave, ladder, arrow, fin and sine motifs. One specific pattern found in the Solomons is typified by the inclusion of the bonito dorsal fin motif, so- called by Joyce (1935), or the U-motif. All kapkaps with this motif were documented as coming from the Solomon Islands, and were excluded from my analytic sample for the reason that the only provenance attributed to them is the Solomons. Groups in this region have a strong affinity for the worship of the bonito fish and representations of this fish are widespread in the Solomons. The pattern is the same in form to the Bismarck Archipelago, with concentric bands radiating out from the centre. The central hub most usually has a flower or star motif. The star comprises four arms, sometimes more. An outer filled triangular tooth-edge motif is also typical of the kapkaps in this region. Waite (1987: 65) states: Central radial designs composed of open ovoid or U-shaped forms so arranged as to resemble a flower or star-like motif seem to typify kapkaps from Malaita. The various types of fretted lines and U-shaped motifs filled with parallel lines also appear to be a feature of kapkaps from this area. Some of the straps which fasten the kapkap to the forehead are adorned with shell decorations whilst several of the tortoiseshell overlays are attached through the central hole with coloured beads wound through. The patterns here are arguably the most intricately carved of the kapkaps in the Pacific. The ornaments are worn on the side of the head, attached by a woven braid around the head. Human, fish and bird motifs are characteristic of kapkaps from this region. Waite states that anthropomorphic figures could correlate to head-hunting (1983: 123). Schuster's (1964) survey of 32 Solomon Island kapkaps with anthropomorphic patterns concludes that the repetition of the anthropomorphic figures can be best summed up by a genealogical perspective. The anthropomorphic motifs are 'a representation of the tribal society conceived as an endless succession of individuals' (ibid. 225). Journal of Museum Ethnography 2001 99</page><page sequence="7">Graeme Were Schuster believes that the kapkap is an emblem of tribal identity, reserved for high ranking persons or proven warriors (ibid. 225). Burt (1990) notes the Malaitan kapkap as an heirloom, handed down through priestly lineages and worn by priests as a mark of rank. A large number of kapkaps that have the provenance New Ireland, the Admiralty Islands and the Solomon Islands are all based on concentric form with the same array of motifs. As outlined in the introduction to this paper, retrospective labelling, bad documentation, trading and muddling by art dealers has meant that the place of origin for these kapkap patterns is almost impossible to specify unless you could see them being made or had eyewitness testimony. The kapkaps are worn around the neck usually hung by a string of shells. Some shell necklaces append two kapkaps so that they can be worn together. Others have two tortoiseshell patterns laid on top of each other. The pattern form is based on a concentric arrangement of motifs repeated in a circular band with variation in the carver's choice of motif. At the centre of the pattern, a flower, star or cross motif is common, sometimes a combination of two. Motifs that traverse this region number around 14, depending on how far one takes a hierarchical classificatory system. There appears at first glance to be some kind of bounded system for producing the carved patterns, as the patterns lack innovation and diversity. The bounded phenomenon is similar to Frankel (1978) who shows that a general corpus of motifs on pottery decoration in Cyprus spans the island. Whereas Frankel found that combinations of motifs were more likely to occur in certain parts of the island, the same is not true for kapkaps here. Since the patterning is identical in form and choice of motifs for the Bismarck Archipelago and the Solomons, I believe that the kapkap patterns form a 'community of culture' in this part of island Melanesia. The fact that kapkap patterns of similar form have been exchanged and traded over this area means that there has to be some kind of contiguity in the social economy of pattern. Focusing on pattern, the remainder of this paper will put forward a methodology for the analysis of the kapkap motifs to investigate the carving process as a knowledge system. Psychological profiling of pattern: a mathematical analysis Following Canter and Lee (1974) on psychological concepts of Japanese living spaces, we can employ the same methodology to sample a collection of kapkap patterns from New Ireland. Canter and Lee (1974) state that there exists a number of behavioural characteristics that make it possible to predict the composition of living spaces in Japanese houses. These behavioural characteristics are a reflection of ideas held by a society on how something should be composed. They show that there are particular trends to the arrangement of furniture in rooms and there exists a tendency for objects to be placed together. This research was also extended to facilitate the impact of western furniture on the traditional home where similar conceptual patterns were shown to be present in the sample taken. Roaf (1978) uses the same analysis to classify the Persepolis reliefs of Southern Iran. By classifying common attributes for a sample of archaeological reliefs, his analysis pointed to three distinct schools of carving which had once worked on the site. Grounding the mathematical data in a social and historical context, Roaf (1978) has produced illuminating insights into 1 00 Journal of Museum Ethnography 2001</page><page sequence="8">Problems in Documenting the Kapkap Persian stonemasonry from 521-486 B.C. while others like Korn (1978) have failed due to their over-complicated methodology and lack of social content. The above methodology can aid us to understand kapkap patterns in a number of ways. Firstly we can say that the carving of tortoiseshell patterns is an expression of both individual and societal concepts of style. The application of particular motifs by the carver is analogous to the arrangement of furniture in Japanese rooms. Spatial arrangement of motifs can be understood as an indigenous knowledge system or a behavioural system reflecting active decision-making processes. Studying the spatial composition of kapkap patterns should reveal something of the conceptual structures involved in pattern formation. Therefore, forging links between pattern and motifs is possible since the decisions that persons make when choosing and arranging motifs may be construed to be both representative of the constructs they have about pattern knowledge and an indication of an indigenous knowledge system that these patterns convey. Patterns are ideally suited to a mathematical analysis for the simple reason that they can be shown to be built up of a series of transformations and repetitions so that they can show clearly how a craftsman learns skills and sub-skills. Patterns are composed of strings of geometric transformations which can be broken down into single units called motifs. A general corpus of motifs common to all patterns in the region means that the data has a bounded set. Carvers chose from a set of motifs with little or no innovation. Geometric in design, most motifs are triangles, tiling patterns and regular petal shapes. Each motif was assigned a generic name for the analysis to account for individual and regional variation. A sample of 206 New Ireland kapkaps was analysed for this project. New Ireland kapkaps were chosen but some were from New Hanover, St Matthias Islands, Tabar and Lihir island groupings and Nissan Island. Kapkaps of identical form from the Admiralty Islands and the Solomons could· quite easily have been used in the sample since as explained above, they evince the same corpus of motifs. The preliminary part of the analysis explored the problem of classification of motif. Bearing in mind the amount written on the subject of classification, six datasets most appropriate to the analysis were compiled. Choice of dataset rested on ethnographic data available and statistical information compiled on the patterns from photographs of the kapkaps. The datasets are as follows: Dataset one: For each kapkap, the pattern was broken down into 14 different motifs comprising of central motifs and concentric motifs. For each pattern, the existence of the motif was recorded in the data field as a simple ' 1 ' and if absent, c0' was recorded in the data field. The dataset consisted of a matrix of 206 χ 14 data cells (corresponding to the number οι kapkaps by number of motifs in the corpus). Dataset two: Similarly as above, patterns were broken down into 16 motifs, a wider differentiation between the concentric motifs than in dataset one. Dataset three: This time, the same classification of motifs was carried out as in dataset two, with the exception that the data entered in the field counted the number of times the motif appeared in the pattern rather than testing for either its presence or absence. Dataset four: This analysis draws from Gladys Reichard's classification of New Ireland pattern motifs albeit slightly modified since not all the motifs present in her Journal of Museum Ethnography 2001 1 01</page><page sequence="9">Graeme Were sample were present in my sample. No central motifs were included in this classification. As previously carried out, 'Γ and Ό' were recorded for presence and absence of motif for each pattern. Dataset five: This is the same as dataset four, except that the sample includes the central motifs similarly to the first three datasets. Dataset six: This is exactly the same as the latter except that there is no differentiation between the 'star' central motif and the 'cross' central motif. Although all of the datasets reproduced roughly the same results, there were several problems accounting for the less used motifs. This was due to the classification of motifs. Dataset one did not allow enough differentiation between the motifs so that several of them were lumped together under the same generic name. The third dataset focused on the frequency of occurrence of various motifs. This produced misleading data for the software to sample since it tended to cluster motifs that rarely occurred together. The fourth dataset, as is shown later, ignores the central motifs whilst the sixth dataset, fails to differentiate between the 'star' and 'cross' central motifs. Dataset five was chosen as the best analysis to take since there was greater depth in classification of the motifs, as well as including central motifs in the sample. Results'. The mathematical analysis7 shows that where one motif is present in the tortoiseshell pattern, then certain other types are likely to occur in combination. Two dominant compositions of motifs occur around the petal and cross central motifs (acting as nodes) whilst a further cluster of motifs loosely surrounds the star motif. A more detailed analysis of the results is as follows: ♦ The central four-petal motif coincides with the application of the eye motif (inscribed within the petals), the triangle motif (not filled), the single and double line motif and the tooth-edge motif (along the outer circumference of the pattern). ♦ The cross central motif is commonly carved with the wave motif, the tile and the filled triangle with tooth-edging motif. ♦ The star motif is typically applied with the line and tooth-edging motif or the filled triangle with tooth-edging motif. The tooth-edging motif and the filled triangle with tooth-edging motif cannot occur in the same pattern. The eye motif is rarely carved with the star since it usually lies within the petal motif. ♦ The four-petal central motif and the cross central motif both form focal points in the mathematical analysis. Motifs closer to these pivotal points are more likely to occur in a pattern than ones further away. ♦ The ball and ladder motifs are likely to occur together in a pattern. ♦ The sine and the arrow motifs appear in 2 per cent oikapkap patterns; 30 per cent of patterns evince the eye motif; 53 per cent evince the triangle motif (not filled) whilst 67 per cent have either tooth-edging on the circumference or the tooth- edge with triangle motif around the circumference of the tortoiseshell pattern. The fin motif appears only once in the entire sample. 1 02 Journal of Museum Ethnography 2001</page><page sequence="10">Problems in Documenting the Kapkap Conclusion The mathematical analysis of motif carving for kapkap patterns reveals two dominant modes of thought in the carving process and one minor one. Although there is little innovation in the design and choice of motifs, the carver's choice of motifs is by no means pre-determined. Innovation only exists within the corpus of motifs chosen, and there are preferences for motifs to be carved in the same pattern. Carvers appear to know how to compose groups of motifs in a pattern and generally know only the corpus of motifs available. The knowledge system is not limited to geographical or cultural region as the patterns appear all over the Bismarck Archipelago and the Solomon Islands. Whether the types of patterns have been produced in separate areas or not, pattern knowledge is shared throughout the region we have looked at. Data also shows that the central motif is important in the composition of the final pattern, even though this appears to be carved last. Clusters of motifs appear to be grouped around specific central motifs (56 per cent of patterns have petal motifs as centres; 18 per cent the star as centre; 25 per cent the cross as centre; a few have combinations of a star and cross as centre). A further inspection of the malangan sculptures of New Ireland substantiates this claim. Depictions of kapkaps are painted in relief on some of the malangans. Many show the central motifs of the patterns whilst ignoring the concentric patterned bands. More significantly, there appears to be a differentiation between the petal central motif, the cross motif and star motif. Taking the underlying workings of pattern as a focal point for the analysis of the kapkap, this paper shows that anthropologists and museum curators should not always rely on the external features of pattern as an indicator of cultural identity. The pervasiveness of the concentric form is no precursor of geographic or cultural area. Although at this prior stage to ethnographic fieldwork it is difficult to assign any cultural significance to the pattern types outlined above, this analysis opens the way for new exploration into indigenous knowledge systems. Furthermore, it underlines the merits of combined museum and anthropological research projects which utilise vast unused collections. Research in the field can take advantage of the results of the mathematical analysis, something I may never have discovered in New Ireland. Fieldwork can then be directed towards investigating flows of pattern in New Ireland society in conjunction with movements of persons and artefacts. Pattern types could be shown to emanate from specific locales. Fieldwork questions aim to address the relationship between the patterns, persons and production and how persons learn this knowledge system. The lack of innovation in the patterns is also a central issue. Future research could also address two supposedly 'static' forms of pattern as defined in the Solomons and the Admiralty Islands. Why is it that the sector-form patterns of the latter and the patterns with the U-motif of the former fail to be catalogued in museum collections of provenance New Ireland? It could be again that curators and collectors feel confident in labelling them of particular origin even when appropriated in New Ireland or that quite simply these types of pattern were not tradable in or to New Ireland.

The Solomon Islands will include both Buka and Bougainville for the purpose of this paper following some classifications in museum documentation (Plate 1). 3 Burt (1981) is the exception to this. 4 Bounded, in this sense, refers to a specific corpus of motifs. 5 Beatrice Blackwood provides some details as to the acquisition of these artefacts. Her collection oikapkaps is on view in the Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford. 6 Leenhardt (1950) states that the wearing of the kapkap by women is confined to eastern New Guinea and the Bismarck Islands. 7 The mathematical analysis was carried out using the Lifa2000 computer software developed in the Centre for Investigative Psychology, University of Liverpool.
