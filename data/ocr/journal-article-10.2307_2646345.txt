<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Illusion of Standardizing the Gods: The Cult of the Five Emperors in Late Imperial China MICHAEL SZONYI N\INETEENTH-CENTURY OBSERVERS of the Fuzhou area, both Chinese and Western, were struck by the worship of a group of deities associated with pestilence and epidemic disease. The local people called these gods the Five Emperors (Wudi). To Justus Doolittle, an American missionary stationed in Fuzhou, the worship paid to the [Five Emperorsi, taken in connection with the idol processions through the streets in honor of them, and the confused and monstrous notions which are prevalent relating to their powers, constitutes an idolatry of the most peculiar and extraordinary character. (Doolittle 1865, 1:276) Proclaimed Zuo Zongtang, Governor-General of Fujian and Zhejiang: "the rival societies for getting up processions to parade the idols have from the beginning violated the law and corrupted morals, hence the evil must be stopped without delay" (Zuo 1867, 22). While these two observers each brought his own concern to bear on his perceptions of popular belief and ritual practice, they were united in their focus on the dangers the worship of these deities posed to public morality and order; neither was much interested in the identities or histories of these gods. But a detailed investigation of their identities and histories may explain how the deities were perceived as dangerous to public morality and order, and offers rich insight into the social history of Late Imperial China. Historians and anthropologists have become increasingly interested in the complex stratification that underlies Chinese myths and symbols.

Although different groups in society developed their own understandings and representations of the state-sanctioned deities they worshipped, the power of state-sanctioned cults could overwhelm and even cause the disappearance of diverse existing local cults (Watson 1985, 292-93). Watson's thesis thus supported the volume's premise that the Late Imperial period saw greater integration of Chinese culture across regional and class lines. This paradigm has since come under closer scrutiny by a number of scholars. Prasenjit Duara has introduced the concept of 'superscription' to describe efforts by the state to privilege particular interpretations and images, in the interest of control and cultural integration (Duara 1988). Paul Katz has suggested the idea of 'reverberation,' the mutual interaction and interpenetration of different representations, both official and popular (Katz 1995). This paper is a further exploration into the issues of multiple representations of cult deities, of their role in the creation and recreation of local culture, and of the relationship between local and national cultures. The paper begins with an analysis of early Daoist texts and texts from the exorcism schools of southern China to put forward an alternative genealogy of the Five Emperors to the one taken for granted by many modern scholars. It then turns to a variety of sources local to the Fuzhou area, dating from the late Ming to Republican period, as the basis for a discussion of how the cult of the Five Emperors was perceived by the people of the region. Detailed investigation into the identity of the Five Emperors and the spread of their cult historically and geographically leads to the conclusion that the effects of state sanctioning of particular deities could be simultaneously more penetrating and more illusory than has been previously noted. Modern scholars have accepted the portrayal of the Five Emperors in local gazetteers as a local manifestation of a trans-local state- sanctioned cult. But the cult looks very different when all the sources, including those internal to the cult itself, are considered. We see a cult perceived to be local and unique, that flourishes because of the efficacy of the deities, the stream of miracles they perform. The cult undergoes a series of conflations with trans-local or national cults, each conflation indicating a new phase in the negotiation between local and trans-local culture, and each leaving a different impact on local society. The unity suggested by national cults of state-sanctioned deities, it will be argued, may often serve to conceal enduring local distinctiveness. The Five Emperors, the Five Manifestations, the Wutong The gazetteers of the Fuzhou region from the Ming and Qing indicate that there were many temples in the area to a group of deities known as the Five Manifestations (Wuxian), but provide few details on these deities and none on the practices associated with them. The gazetteers and a wide variety of other sources also describe a group of deities called the Five Emperors (Wudi). Various stories and histories circulate about these deities, and there is considerable evidence on the rituals of their cult. But there is no mention of temples to these deities in the temple lists in the gazetteers, though of course these do not claim to be comprehensive. Angelika Cedzich and Richard von Glahn have traced the complex history of the Five Manifestations in great detail. These gods were originally called the Wutong, a</page><page sequence="3">THE ILLUSION OF STANDARDIZING THE GODS 115 form of the malicious mountain spirits known as shanxiao, which had come to be renamed through the influence of Buddhism. The twelfth-century work Yijianzhi includes several stories involving deities or demons called Wutong, which suggest the persistent ambiguity of the term. Wutong refers sometimes to a single deity, often portrayed as one-legged or even simply as a large foot or leg, and sometimes to a group of five anthropomorphic deities. In other stories Wutong refers to a generic category of deity (Hong Mai [1157-12021 1981, 4:19:695; 7:2:891; 15:7:1613; 11:10:1295). Cedzich and von Glahn have described a complicated process whereby the Wutong were 'rechristened' into the Five Manifestations through the creation and elaboration of a claim by the people of Wuyuan, in modern Jiangxi province, that the cult originated there. Song and later Ming emperors recognized this claim and patronized the Wuyuan temple (Cedzich 1985, 1995; von Glahn 1991). In 1174, the deities at Wuyuan were promoted to the status of dukes and given new, two-syllable honorary epithets, each one beginning with the character Manifest (xian), whereupon they became known as the Five Manifestations (von Glahn 1991, 665). In a second line of tradition, the older, generic, often demonic Wutong continued to flourish all over south China, especially in the Jiangnan region, where the gods underwent a further transformation into the local god of wealth (von Glahn 1991, 676; Cedzich 1995, 139). The earliest appearance of the term Wutong in sources from the Fuzhou area is a twelfth-century local gazetteer, which describes a temple dedicated to the deities that was located outside the city wall and had been built in the Jingde reign period (1004- 7). But worship of the deities, the gazetteer claimed, went back to the post-Tang interregnum (Sanshan zhi [11821 1638, 8:7702-3). No mention is made of any link with the cult in Wuyuan. Zhu Xi, a repeated visitor to Fuzhou, is also silent on a possible connection. Zhu Xi visited the Wutong temple in Wuyuan, his ancestral home, at the behest of his relatives, and he found the temple "mysterious and strange" (Zhu Xi [1270] 1986, 3:53). But he does not mention that these same deities were also to be found in Fuzhou. Thus in the Song sources we find nothing to link the Wutong temple in Fuzhou with the cult centered in Jiangxi aside from the use of the highly ambiguous term Wutong. In contrast to the earlier sources, Ming and Qing gazetteers list temples to the Five Manifestations in Fuzhou and link them to the cult center in Wuyuan. In these sources it is extremely difficult to distinguish between the Five Emperors, the Five Manifestations, and the Wutong. The same temples which the Song sources call Wutong temples are named as Five Manifestations temples in those from the Ming and Qing, and sometimes these same temples are also called Five Emperors temples. According to a fifteenth-century provincial gazetteer, the Fuzhou temple described in the twelfth- century gazetteer as a Wutong temple is now "the Temple of the Five Manifestations.... According to the Suzhou gazetteer, the Five Manifestations are the tutelary deities of Wuyuan" (Bamin tongzhi [1490] 1989, 58:365). One gazetteer tells of a certain temple at the West Lake in Fuzhou being destroyed in a campaign of suppression of the Five Emperors cult. But in the lists of temples in the same gazetteer, the temple is listed as a shrine for the worship of the Wutong (Xihu zhi 1915, 10:1 lb; 8:19a). Guo Bocang (1815-90) describes the confusion in his gazetteer of Black Rock Hill in Fuzhou city: "Many of the village temples in the area worship the Five Emperors.... People mistakenly point to the Wittong and Five Manifestations as being the Five Emperors" (Wushishan zhi 1842, 4:63a). When one visits modern reconstructions of temples in the Fuzhou area that the gazetteers describe as temples to the Five Manifestations, moreover, one is told by</page><page sequence="4">116 MICHAEL SZONYI worshippers that these temples were formerly, and still are, temples to the Five Emperors, not to the Five Manifestations. Between 1992 and 1995, I visited over twenty such temples, and was given similar explanations in each. Recent scholarship has attempted to resolve this paradox by simply equating the Wutong/Five Manifestations tradition with the Five Emperors. Xu Xiaowang reports that the Five Emperors of Fuzhou "developed through the transformation of the Wutong" (Xu Xiaowang 1993, 89). In this he follows Liu Zhiwan, who wrote that these various different names "are in fact all the same" (Liu Zhiwan [1963] 1983, 293). Valerie Hansen, although she does not mention the Five Emperors, does accept uncritically that the cult of the Five Manifestations in Fuzhou originated in Wuyuan (Hansen 1990, 140). As will be seen, this rather simplistic equation of different traditions is unsatisfactory for many reasons. Barend ter Haar's work on the White Lotus tradition points the way to an alternative resolution of the paradox. Ter Haar distinguishes between the "autonym," a term used "by believers to refer to themselves" and the label, which outsiders, sometimes incorrectly, apply as an analytic category (ter Haar 1992, 1). The resolution of the paradoxical relationship between the two traditions lies in recognizing that in the Ming and Qing, the Five Manifestations became a label used to refer to the cult of the Five Emperors, but was not an autonym used by believers in the cult themselves. The Origins of the Cult of the Five Emperors If we set aside for the moment the facile equation of the Five Emperors with the Five Manifestations and study more closely the sources intrinsic to the Fuzhou cult itself, it becomes evident that the Five Emperors emerged out of widely diffused beliefs in pentads of spirits associated with pestilential diseases, that in the Fuzhou region these beliefs coalesced into what the people of Fuzhou saw as a distinct local cult with no external links, and that this cult developed its own complex ritual and iconographic tradition, with no direct links to the Five Manifestations tradition of Wuyuan. Paul Katz's recent book offers a penetrating analysis of beliefs in pestilence spirits (Katz 1995, 50-59). Our earliest sources on the development of beliefs about deities and demons associated with plagues and epidemics come from the Daoist liturgical tradition, within which the Nuqing guilu (The Nuqing Register of Demons), compiled by the fourth century at the latest, is the oldest extant work.1 Li Fengmao has shown that this work is based on a number of ideas that had gradually coalesced into a body of knowledge about disease and its treatment. The idea that there were five kinds of pestilence had emerged with the spread of Five Phases thought in the Han. Human conduct was seen as interconnected with the natural order; when human behavior violated that order, demons of disease were dispatched to inflict punishment. Acquiring knowledge of the true name and appearance of these demons gave one power over them, including the power to expel them (Li Fengmao 1993, 423-33). The Nziqing guilu accordingly provides long lists of names of demons, for use in response to outbreaks of disease. Among these is a group of five known as the Five Demon Masters (Wuguizhu). Their names are Liu Yuanda, Zhang Yuanbo, Zhao 'It is not clear from this text to what exactly the Nuqing refers, but it appears that only a portion of the original text survives (Li Fengmao 1993, 426).</page><page sequence="5">THE ILLUSION OF STANDARDIZING THE GODS 117 Gongming, Zhong Shili, and Shi Wenye, and each is responsible for the transmission of a different kind of disease (Nuqing guilu, 6:2a-b).2 By the Song and Yuan, the five different categories of disease had become associated with Five Emperor-Commissioners (Wudi shizhe), who carry out the will of Heaven in spreading pestilence in the world. In the Taishang dongyuan ciwenshen zhou miaojing, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning explains that the Five Emperor-Commissioners are agents of disease; armed with a heavenly talisman they spread illness according to the registers of individual behavior. Modifying bad behavior was the way to cure disease, but the immediate response should be performance of the appropriate rituals invoking the aid of the Five Emperor- Commissioners (Taishang dongyuan ciwenshen zhou miaojing, la-2b). Liturgical texts of the new exorcism sects of the period, such as the Shenxiao and Qingwei, explicitly link these Five Emperor-Commissioners with deities called the Five Fierce Gods (Wuchang) or the Great Deities of the Five Routes and Cardinal Directions (Wufang Wulu dashen). Zhao Gongming, besides being one of the Five Emperor- Commissioners, is also one of the Four Marshalls who are the focus of a body of exorcistic texts contained in the Daofa huiyuan, the great fourteenth-century corpus of different ritual traditions, many of them from south China.3 In one such text, Zhao and the Fierce Generals of the Four Quadrants, Liu, Zhang, Zhong and Shi, are accompanied by the Great Deities of the Five Routes and Cardinal Directions (Daofa huiyuan 232:3b, 6b). Another text gives the personal names of these Fierce Generals, and these correspond to the names of the Demon Masters given above, with the addition of one Fan Juqing (Daofa huiyuan 236:4a-b). The Five Emperor-Commissioners also appear in the Soushen ji, which tells of the appearance in the sky of five martial figures in 591. The Sui emperor is told that they are five demons of pestilence. To avert the danger, the emperor gives them each the title of General and orders a shrine to be built for them. A similar story is found in a Yuan work on the pantheon, which adds that the gods were worshipped on the fifth day of the fifth month (Xinbian lianxiang soushen guangji). Li Fengmao argues persuasively that the Five Emperor-Commissioners are none other than the Five Demon Masters of the earlier texts, demons who have been defeated and converted into emissaries of Heaven (Li Fengmao 1994; 1993, 449).4 Zhuang Zhuo's 1133 work Jile bian describes a festival for the exorcism of the gods of the Five Plagues (Zhuang Zhuo [11331 1988, 21). In the Ming and Qing, pentads of plague gods were worshipped all over China, often on the fifth day of the fifth month (Huang Shi 1963, 57-67). The Suzhou cult of the Worthy Sages of the Five Directions (Wufang xiansheng), in whose name in the seventeenth-century mass processions for warding off plague were held at this time of year, and who became the targets of a famous campaign against heterodoxy by Tang Bin, would seem to be one version of this practice (Wang Zhideng [16461 1922, 2b). Common to these cults is their apparent derivation, evident from iconographical, hagiographical, and ritual similarities, from older beliefs in pentads of plague spirits who originally were responsible for inflicting disease but who had been defeated by beneficent gods and conscripted into the ranks of plague-dispelling deities. 2At least one of the five was a historical or parahistorical figure. Zhong Shili was a general whose biography is at San Guo zhi 1990, 2: 627-38. Zhao Gongming is an important figure in the Daoist pantheon and appears in a great many other texts. See Lii and Luan 1986, 477-8 1, 625-32. 3Van der Loon 1979 gives a detailed analysis of the Daofa huiyuan. 4The Zhengyi wensi bi dushen dengyi and Taishang sanwu bang jiu jiao wudi duanwen yi, both associated with pestilence, also refer to the Five Emperors.</page><page sequence="6">118 MICHAEL SZONYI The Fuzhou Cult in the Ming and Qing The cult of the Five Emperors was just such a cult to just such a pentad of plague spirits that developed in Fuzhou in late imperial times. A full chronology of the development of the cult is not yet possible, but enough information is available to outline some of its distinctive features. Perhaps most striking were its ritual practices and iconography. They reflect a number of different influences, some local and immediate, others drawing on elements long present in the ritual and religious repertoire of Chinese culture. The most thorough description of the ritual practices of the cult in late imperial times is found in the anonymous diary Record of Tidings from the Banyan City: In the second month [of 16421 pestilence arose. According to the customary rules of the locality, prayers and sacrifice [are offeredi to the local gods, among which are some named the Five Emperors. So the residents of each ritual area collect money to hold a ritual jiao of the great Nuo exorcism.... The local gods of each area pay their respects according to a schedule. When they go out there are insignia and sedan chairs, seals with ribbon and "documents" [the equivalent of present-day visiting cardsJ. [The deitiesi offer greetings to one another, and there are the curious practices of the adjutant handing out announcements tof the deities' visitsJ and "rushing the chair" on arrival at the gate. Moreover there are vendors and vagabonds who either dress up with the faces of ghosts, or play the roles of the yamen runners. They go along the streets in a procession, competing to show off the splendor to one another. Then they make a paper boat, to the utmost detail; none of the implements and odds-and-ends are forgotten. When starting work or launching the boat, they always select a lucky time, just as if they were making a [reall boat. Launching the boat is called Putting Out to Sea (chuhai) to indicate the Five Emperors driving the pestilence away out to sea. On this day, they slaughter a goat and a pig, and facing the boat offer them in sacrifice. The crowd gathers in groups of ten or a hundred people, striking gongs and beating drums. There are several dozen gongs, and just as many drums. Those who are in charge either wave flags or carry the boat, making a tremendous racket which frightens the heart and startles the spirit. Before this, they may also hold an exorcistic procession. Images of the Five Emperors and their subordinates made of paper and paste ride on horses in a circle all around the town. Those who follow carrying incense number in the several thousands; none of them even dare to breathe in the hot sun. This is known as qingxiang. When the time has come for the boat to be set off, then [everyonel rushes and is afraid of being left behind. The sweat boils upon them like rain, and [even if} they fall down and have an accident they are still willing to accept this. When one village has just finished, another village starts up, even to the point that three or four villages, or even six or seven villages, do this on the same day. From the second to the eighth month, the market towns and villages every day turned into a country of ghosts. (Haiwai sanren 1980, 2-3)5 These exorcistic parades, in which the Five Emperors tour the neighborhood of their temples, complete with elaborate costumes and the paraphernalia of imperial officers, call to mind the Great Exorcism or Nuo, the major exorcistic rituals of ancient China (see Bodde 1975, 81-82). The parading of boats as a response to disease was widespread from the Song, if not earlier. For example, Zhuang Zhuo's account of an exorcism festival early in the twelfth century relates: 5Some of the more difficult terms in this text are analyzed in Nakatani 1987.</page><page sequence="7">THE ILLUSION OF STANDARDIZING THE GODS 119 Figure 1.

It is decorated with five colors. . .. [The boat] is let to float in the river. This is called Sending off Pestilence. (Zhuang Zhuo [1 13 3] 1988, 2 1) In 1273 an official in Jiangyxi forbade the ritual parading of such boats in times of pestilence. The practice was evidently common, for the official ordered the destruction of 1300 boats (Huang Zhen n.d., 79:21b-22b; see van der Loon 1977, 148). The Divine Empyrean Ritual for Expelling Pestilence by Sending off a Boat, included in the Daofa huiyuan, describes the ritual construction of an Ornamental Boat (hua chuan), which is burned in order to deal with illness (Daofa huiyuan, 220:1la-7b). Schipper has discussed liturgies of boat expulsion rites associated with the Wangye in contemporary Taiwan, and Paul Katz has demonstrated that such rites were extremely common throughout South China in the late imperial period (Schipper 1985; Katz 1995). The relationship between the earlier textual rituals, ritual practice in Fuzhou in the later period, and similar rituals in other places remains an important topic for future research. In the Qing, the annual festival of the Five Emperors took place on the fifth day of the fifth month. According to the 1754 prefectural gazetteer: The gods are commonly known as the Great Emperors. Their images are always set up in [groups of) five. Their appearance is fierce and frightening. Their palaces are majestic. Those who pass in front of them hold their breath and do not dare to look.

(Fuzhoufuzhi 1754, 24:4b-5a) Doolittle offers a detailed description of the iconography of the deities: The chief . .. is represented with a pleasant human countenance, and having three eyes, one situated in the middle of his forehead, and with a long red beard... .The appearance of all the Five Rulers, except the one first mentioned, is ugly and repulsive. These four have hideous faces, having a snout projecting much like swine, or having extremely large noses, or having eyes and features generally similar to a monkey. Sometimes the mouth is four-cornered, or coming to a point like the mouth of a fowl.6 (Doolittle 1865, 1:277) The grotesque iconography of deities associated with pestilence is another aspect of cult practice that can be traced at least as far back as the Song. According to the funerary inscription of an official in Jiangnan: 6Doolittle does note, however, that "the images in different temples are not alike. There seems to be very much licence taken by the architect in regard to shape and colour."</page><page sequence="9">THE ILLUSION OF STANDARDIZING THE GODS 121 Table 1.

(Ye Shi n.d., 23:10b) Doolittle also provides the surnames of the deities: Zhang, Liu, Zhao, Zhong and Shi (Doolittle 1865, 1:277). In the early twentieth-century, the same five surnames were in common use (Chen Zhenrui 1930). In field investigations in over twenty temples in four counties, I have found that villagers identify the deities with the same five surnames in virtually every temple (for details, see Szonyi 1996, chap. 5). Table 1 provides the names of the various deities found in the early Daoist texts and similar details from the nineteenth- and twentieth-century sources as well as contemporary iconography. The results are striking. In the total matrix of thirty-five names, there is a single discrepancy in one surname. Though a direct link cannot be established, the history of the Five Emperors of Fuzhou, it seems clear, cannot possibly be understood without reference to the Daoist textual tradition. Aside from the gazetteer accounts, there is no evidence that any temple to the Five Emperors was ever perceived as a branch of some original ancestral temple to the Five Manifestations elsewhere. On the contrary, the ancestral temple of the cult of the Five Emperors was located precisely in Fuzhou. It was there to which the various temples owed their origins, and it was there that the apex of the nested hierarchy of cults was centered. Beginning around the mid-Ming, the cult of the Five Emperors began to spread continuously beyond Fuzhou as far as Funing to the north, Putian to</page><page sequence="10">122 MICHAEL SZONYI the south, and Taiwan to the east.7 The gazetteers of Funing distinguish explicitly between the temple hierarchies of the Five Emperors and the Five Manifestations. The 1762 edition of the prefectural gazetteer describes a temple to the Five Manifestations that is explicitly linked to the larger cult: "there is no place south of the [Yangtze] that does not worship them."8 The Five Emperors, by contrast, are worshipped at a different temple, and mostly by sojourners from Fuzhou (Funingfilzhi 1762, 34:2b). A later gazetteer lists a second temple in the prefecture and records that it was constructed in 1737 and restored in 1895 (Xiapu xianzhi 1929, 24:2b). The earliest of about a dozen temples to the Five Emperors in contemporary Taiwan was also built by migrants from Fuzhou in the early Qing (Lian Heng [1920-211 1983, 403-4; Qiu Dezai 1981, 421-22).9 The spread of the cult to Xianyou in Putian, to the south of Fuzhou, is described in a seventeenth-century inscription south of the county seat. "The Five Emperors were at first the Emperors of Fuzhou city, and originally we of Xianyou did not dare to invite and worship them [here)." In 1650 the deities appeared in a vision to a local Daoist and instructed him to build them a temple, which was completed in 1653 (Tang Xianyue 1653). Another source from the Putian area links the appearance of the deities to the frequency of outbreaks of epidemic disease in southeastern coastal China (Tianxian wuhuang dadi xiaojie benxing baoJing).10 The number of temples to the deities in Fuzhou itself grew dramatically during the late Ming and Qing. The 1520 gazetteer of Fuzhou prefecture lists three temples in the vicinity of the city, two of them then extant (Fuzhouifuzhi 1520, 31:1Gb; Mindii ji [16121 1831, 3:1lb). The third, which had fallen into disuse, is the original Wutong temple mentioned in the Song gazetteer."1 In the mid-eighteenth century, it was said that more than ten temples to the Five Emperors had sprung up in the place of a Wutong temple destroyed by official order in 1700 (Fuzhoufuzhi 1754, 24:5a-b; Xihu zhi 1915, 10:11b). The Record of the White Chicken, a script for recitation in local dialect probably dating from the late Qing, identifies nineteen temples devoted to the Five Emperors within the city walls.12 In the early twentieth century, Chen 7The evidence on the spread of the cult to western Fujian is ambiguous. Zuo Zongtang reported in the mid-nineteenth century that "since being stationed in Yanping [to the west of Fuzhoul I have investigated and learned that in the provincial capital there are temples to deities called the Five Emperors." This implies that the deities were not worshipped in Yanping itself (Zuo 1867, 22). The cult of the Five Emperors from Fuzhou seems to have been spread to Wenzhou by an official who was a Fujian native, Lin Yingxiang. Lin built a temple to the Five Commis- sioners of Epidemics while serving in Wenzhou in 1598 (Sun 1888, xia: 18b-19a). I owe this reference to Paul Katz. "The temple is also discussed in the 1616 edition of the gazetteer. The deity was alter- natively known as Huaguang, a Buddhist avatar of the Five Manifestations. The temple's festival was held on the eighth day of the fourth month, the same date as the festival of the Wuyuan Five Manifestations cult center (Funing zhouzhi 1616, 4:9b-lOa). 9Modern materials from the temple also claim it was founded during the Kangxi period by merchants from Xiadu in Fuzhou, and identify the Wutong temple mentioned in the Song gazeteer as the founding ancestral temple (Xilaian Guanli Weiyuanhui 1965).

The Five Emperors in Local Popular Culture The Five Emperors have become an important part of the local literary, ritual, and oral tradition of the Fuzhou area. In this section, I present a number of texts that reflect different aspects of the identities of the deities in the local cultural tradition.13 Whatever the sources we use to get closer to popular understandings and representations of the cult, be they popular literature, Daoist texts, or missionary accounts, the picture that emerges is of a distinct local cult, with its own distinct history. Much recent scholarship on popular cults in late imperial China has stressed the interaction or reverberation between elite and popular cultural forms. In the case of the Five Emperors, it is striking that a very specific and limited form of interaction has taken place. Several accounts stress the demonic origins of the gods. In 1995, I obtained from a master puppeteer in Fuqing a script for marionette theater entitled The Five Numinous Gentlemen of the Palace of Heavenly Immortals. In this work, Guanyin decides to descend to earth and persuade humankind to remedy its poor behavior, vowing that she will not return unless successful. A humorous scene follows in which Guanyin attempts unsuccessfu.lly to intercede with four friends, each of them guilty of a different vice. In frustration, Guanyin expels a breath which is transformed into four demons known '3Most of these sources were collected in fieldwork in Fuzhou from 1992 to 1995.

When the Supreme Emperor learns of this, he commands Guanyin to rectify the situation. She transforms herself into the fifth sage, defeats the other four in a challenge, and forces them to be more discriminating. Together, as the Five Emperors, they seize the souls of evil people but allow the good to live (Tianxianfu wulinggong). The Supplementary Record of the Min (Fujian) Capital also provides an explanation of the origins of the deities. This work, compiled by an author now known only by his pseudonym Villager Who Asks for Nothing (Liren heqiu),14 appears to have been originally a collection of scripts for use by local storytellers, and thus the stories were probably in circulation for some time prior to the compilation of the text in the nineteenth century. The work comprises legends and stories from the Fuzhou region. One is the story of five spirits-an aquatic monkey, an aquatic crow, an oyster, a perch, and an aquatic frog-who dwell in a bottomless pool of the Min River opposite Fuzhou city. They learn how to take human form, emerge from the pool, and "confuse people into letting their vital fluids drain away, and then dividing and eating the flesh of the dead bodies." The frog, the least capricious of the five spirits, attempts to restrain his fellows. He convinces the other four spirits that they should not eat human flesh, whereupon they are transformed into Wutong deities. When people encounter them they believe them to be the emperors of the five directions descending to earth. So they build a Temple to the Five Emperors by the banks of the river (Liren heqiu 1987, 250:638). Other versions of the origins of the Five Emperors make no mention of their demonic origin. Worshippers at a temple to the deities in Putian currently recite a scripture entitled The Precious Scripture of the Basic Exorcistic Practice of the Heavenly Immortals, the Five Great Emperors, which is attributed to the Immortal Lii Dongbin and which was in circulation by the late Qing.15 The text begins with the Five Emperors, in the presence of the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning and other assembled deities, expressing their pity for the hungry ghosts and demons of the underworld. The Celestial Worthy bestows a heavenly talisman on the Emperors and explains that in order to allow the myriad living things to escape the same fate, their behavior must be transformed so that they follow the sages of the three teachings. The Five Emperors visit the Buddha, who gives them a copy twenty leaves long from the True Scripture of the Great Vehicle. They then visit the Jade Emperor and the Supreme Exalted Old Lord [i.e., Laozil, who give them the Volume of Sympathetic Response. Finally, they visit Confucius, who orders Zengzi to give them a Scripture of Filial Piety in one juan. The extant part of the scripture ends with the Five Emperors back in the Heavenly Palace, where the assembled celestial multitudes praise their compassionate hearts as they prepare to embark on the salvation of humankind (Tianxian wuhuang dadi xiaojie benxing baojing). A second marionette theater script also places the Five Emperors in the Daoist pantheon. The Five Emperors Drama consists of a number of episodes wherein the Five Emperors are dispatched to various places on earth by the Pearly Emperor to reward 14Or, perhaps, as Vivienne Lo (1993, 80) suggests, Where Do You Look for the Local Person? "5The temple keeper of the Zhengjidian temple in the village of Dongfen was kind enough to allow me to photograph the partial text in the temple on 8 March 1994. According to the preface, the text originally comprised five j'uan in three fascicles; I have obtained only the first and the third of these, but the second is reportedly extant, and the content is certainly known by associations of lay worshippers from Putian who recite it at the annual rituals to the deities. The Dongfen scripture is undated, but another edition of the text which I collected in Hui'an in 1995 begins with a preface from the Guangxu reign period (1875-1907).</page><page sequence="14">126 MICHAEL SZONYI good behavior and punish transgressions by spreading pestilence. At one point in the text, a Daoist priest conducts sacrifices and constructs a decorative boat in which to send the deities back to the heavenly realms (Wuhuang xizhuan).16 Guo Boyang, an important figure in local gentry society at the turn of this century, has recorded yet another account of the origins of the deities. The Five Emperors, he relates, were originally five licentiates, in the city to write the provincial examination. One night, they overhear a gathering of ghosts plotting to poison a well. The ghosts gleefully remark that they will be able to kill more than half the inhabitants of the city. The five students attempt to prevent anyone from drawing water from the well, but nobody will believe their story. So they decide to sacrifice themselves, and together they drink all the water in the well. After their death, the people of the city are deeply moved and carve images of them to worship (Guo Boyang n.d., irregular pagination).'7 Analysis of these different myths hints at the different layers of meaning that have been inscribed on the Five Emperors at different times by different groups. Together, these myths mirror the transformation suggested in the earlier Daoist sources, from baleful demons to munificent deities, and suggest the ambiguity that the people of Fuzhou must have continued to feel for the Five Emperors. Some of the myths emphasize their demonic origins, while others obscure this aspect and stress instead the power of the deities to relieve those suffering from plague. Not surprisingly, this vision of the deities is emphasized in the script for recitation by lay worshippers, turning to the deities in times of need. The production of this sort of script in the style of scriptures in the Daoist Canon, argue Dean and Zheng, marks the transformation from a recitation of a local oral tradition to participation in a wider cultural universe (Dean and Zheng 1992).18 Finally, the most recent version of the myth suggests a gentry effort to Confucianize the deities, to incorporate them into a literati ideal. Similar attempts have been described in the history of other cults, most notably that of Guandi, whose representations in Qing temple inscriptions stress his Confucian virtue and loyalty to authority (Duara 1988). Representing the Cult in the Gazetteers Guo Boyang's attempt to Confucianize the deities is unique in official and elite writings. For the most part, members of the local elite and officialdom characterized the cult in one of two ways, either conflating it with the Five Manifestations, or sharply criticizing it as heterodox. As we have seen, Ming and Qing gazetteers linked temples devoted to deities known to the locals as the Five Emperors with the Five Manifestations cult center in Wuyuan. This identification of the cult in Fuzhou with the state-sanctioned deities whose home temple was in Wuyuan became an enduring theme in gazetteers and other sources, persisting in such sources into the twentieth century. The compiler of a nineteenth-century edition of the gazetteer of Changle county, south of Fuzhou, linked local temples with the Wutong/Five Manifestations tradition by tracing both to the first Ming emperor: 16J am grateful to Prof. Ken Dean, who obtained this script from a puppeteer in Putian. 17Stories of well poisoning are a common trope in plague lore. See, for example, Dore 1933, 2:10:137-41. "8If the hypothesis that the Five Emperors cult derives from widespread beliefs in pentads of plague spirits is correct, then there are two transformations here, from wider belief to local cult and then back again.</page><page sequence="15">THE ILLUSION OF STANDARDIZING THE GODS 127 The Founding Emperor of the Ming made his capital at Jinling [i.e. Nanjingi. Then in the capital he built fourteen temples. One of these was called the temple of the Five Manifestations and Heavenly Agents (Wuxian lingguan). The worship of the Five Manifestations throughout the empire at present in fact comes from this. (Changle xianzhi 1869, 8:30b) What appears to have happened is that in the Ming, when the Five Manifestations from Wuyuan were granted state sanction, gazetteer editors manufactured an explicit connection between these deities and the deities worshipped in Fuzhou as the Five Emperors. As von Glahn suggests, Ming endorsement of the Jiangnan cult, "in effect condoned worship of them throughout the empire" (von Glahn 1991, 678 n. 88). It also condoned worship of deities that could be represented in their guise. This misidentification by official authors persisted in gazetteer sources to the late Qing. But study of the Five Emperors has made clear that the link is not so straightforward. The Five Emperors emerged out of widely diffused beliefs about pentads of plague spirits, beliefs that had begun to be inscribed in the Daoist liturgical tradition long before the late imperial period. Out of this belief grew a local cult whose believers seem to have had no sense of belonging to any larger tradition, and certainly not to the Five Manifestations. By the Ming at the latest, this Fuzhou cult went by the name of the Five Emperors. It developed a complex and distinct iconographic and ritual tradition, some but by no means all of which was unique to the Fuzhou area. Different groups in local society developed their own representations of the deities, according to their own soteriological needs. The Five Emperors cannot be considered simply the local name for the state-sanctioned cult of the Five Manifestations. Rather, this distinctive local cult, with ambiguous links to an ancient tradition that had never been sanctioned by the state, has been presented in certain sources as part of a different ancient tradition that had been sanctioned. The gods have not been standardized, but an illusion of standardization has been manufactured, concealing a vibrant and changing local tradition. Returning to ter Haar's terminology, what appears in the gazetteers is essentially a pseudoautonym, a term used by outsiders to label groups who would not have used the same term to label themselves. A further level of complexity remains to be added, for it appears that the subterfuge by which the Five Emperors were conflated with the Five Manifestations was not entirely successful. In 1700, Prefect Chi Weicheng, a Han Bannerman who had taken office in Fuzhou in 1697, launched a campaign against the deities. His own memorial dealing with the subject has been lost, but there is ample record of his actions. When an epidemic broke out in the city in 1698-99, shortly after his arrival, the frantic processions from a temple to the Five Emperors at West Lake aroused his ire, and he ordered the images of the deities destroyed. The local gentry then petitioned him to convert the temple into an academy and shrine to Zhu Xi, which later became the West Lake Academy. Chi was credited with the destruction of over one hundred licentious temples. His activities were recorded approvingly in a poem entitled "The Prefect of Fuzhou Destroys the Licentious Temples," by Zha Shenxing (jinshi 1703), but the prefectural gazetteer dryly assessed his accomplishments from a longer perspective: "Chi died, and not long after the appearance of the temples remained imposing" (Fuzhoufuzhi 1754, 24:5a; 47:23a; Xihu zhi 1915, 10:1 lb; Zha Shenxing 1986, 2:696). Zha's poem suggests that Chi first became aware of the gods when a procession in their honor encountered his cortege on the streets and refused to yield. Doolittle tells a similar story, which he dates to some fifteen to twenty years previous to his</page><page sequence="16">128 MICHAEL SZONYI writing in the mid-eighteenth century. Xie Zhangting was probably describing the same story when he wrote of a roadside encounter between the deities and one Wang Shenzhai, an official who served in the Fuzhou region early in the Daoguang reign period (1821-50) (Xie Zhangting [19011 1975, 2400). Once the official in Doolittle's tale had made his intentions to suppress the cult known to the devotees of the Rulers, arrangements were made by which the title of the god of war, Kuang Ta [i.e. Guandil, should appear on their temples, and an image of this god was placed in them. This title was used as a shield for the Five Rulers, as it could be said these are temples of the god of war. As the god of war was in high favour with the ruling dynasty, no mandarin dare interfere with any temple called after his name or title [italics in originall. (Doolittle 1865, 1:278) A proclamation dated March 5, 1865, issued by the Zuo Zongtang, which outlaws the procession festivals of the Five Emperors, mentions the practice of "falsely using the pretence of worshipping the Martial Sage in order to reconstruct the temples [of the deitiesl" (Zuo Zongtang 1867, 22-23). In the Republican period, Chen Zhenrui also found that shrines to the Five Emperors were concealed in Guandi temples, though he believed this to be a response to the Republican government's campaign to eliminate superstition (Chen Zhenrui 1930). The conflation of the Five Emperors with Guandi also found its way into local popular culture. The Record of the White Chicken tells of a high official who suffered injury at the hands of a subordinate of the Five Emperors. When he threatened to destroy all temples of the Five Emperors in Fuzhou, the keepers of the temples decided to rename them Guandi temples. "Because the officials and gentry all worshipped Guandi, further trouble could be avoided" (Baijiji). The association is also reflected in contemporary practice. One of the largest temples to the Five Emperors in the Fuzhou suburbs is in the Auspicious Footprint Monastery. The Five Emperor deities are located in one of the two main halls of the temple, the other being a shrine to Guandi, clearly identifiable by his red face and large black beard. A reconstructed temple of the Five Emperors in the village of Yixu is also called the Guandi temple, though the only images in the temple are those of the Five Emperors.19 These historical records and stories drawn from local lore suggest that the discrete local cult of the Five Emperors, which had formerly been presented to the state as the local version of the state-sanctioned cult of the Five Manifestations, was at some point revealed to prominent local officials to be nothing more than a cult to heterodox deities in disguise. This generated renewed official efforts to clearly distinguish the Five Emperors from the Five Manifestations, and to eradicate their cult. In response, local devotees looked for a new cover for the gods, eventually settling on that of Guandi, who Duara has described, along with Mazu, as the god most identified as representative of Chinese culture (Duara 1988, 786). It is in this second disguise, now ineffectual given that the People's Republic sanctions no deities, that temples to the Five Emperors have been reconstructed in the 1980s and 1990s.20 191 visited these two temples on 6 April 1993 and 19 October 1992. 20The persistence of Guandi as a cover for the deities into the modern revival cautions us against too narrowly instrumental a reading of popular culture. Fidelity to perceived tradition can itself be a powerful influence on the shaping of cult practices.</page><page sequence="17">THE ILLUSION OF STANDARDIZING THE GODS 129 Conclusions By setting aside the simple labeling by elite writers of the Five Emperors as a local version of the Five Manifestations, and considering the historical sources internal to the cult itself, it has become possible to view the Five Emperors as a cult that grew out of widespread beliefs in plague deities, but that was understood by its believers to be unique to the locality. It flourished both through the expansion in the range of activities of these believers and because of their perceptions of the efficacy of the deities in disease prevention or cure. It is clear that the cult of the Five Emperors, despite the claims of the gazetteers and of modern scholars, was not simply a local manifestation of the Five Manifestations of Wuyuan. There is just no evidence that in the Song the Wutong cult in Wuyuan, later to be the home of the Five Manifestations, and the Wutong temple in Fuzhou were linked by anything more than a name which at that time could refer both to specific deities and to a generic category of deities. If Wutong is thought of as simply a category of deity, then the Five Emperors could be thought of as an item within that category. But if Wutong/Five Manifestations is seen as a particular group of deities, with a particular tradition centered on Wuyuan and enjoying the patronage of the imperial state, then there is no evidence internal to that cult linking it with Fuzhou.2" Cedzich has suggested that the relationship between the Five Manifestations and the Wiitong presents "the seemingly paradoxical situation that the [Five Manifestationsl and Wu-t'ung were the same (for the lower classes), yet different (for the upper class)" (Cedzich 1994, 202). The situation was precisely the opposite for the Five Emperors and Five Manifestations. The local elite may have portrayed the Five Emperors as being the same as the Five Manifestations in some sources, but ordinary devotees of the cult, had they even been aware of the Five Manifestations and the practices associated with them, would have seen them as utterly different from their own deities, the Five Emperors. To accept at face value that the Five Emperors were simply a local version of the Wutong/Five Manifestations is to accept a single superscription of the deities over all others, and to deny the flexibility of local cultures to persist within an overarching translocal culture. But there can be no doubt that part of the explanation for the flourishing of the Five Emperors cult lies in the series of manufactured associations, misidentifications or conflations between this local cult and state-sanctioned translocal cults. These conflations, first with the Five Manifestations and later with Guandi, have had little effect on the ritual practices or iconography of the cult. Calling the temples to the deities Five Manifestations temples seems to have had no effect on the iconography of the images, which over a period of centuries consistently displayed connections with an entirely different set of deities. Nor did calling the temples to the deities Guandi temples have any effect on the distinctive ritual practices of the cult, which have also endured for centuries. The complex and fluid ritual and iconographic tradition that developed around the Five Emperors, a series of appropriations and modifications of elements from widespread Chinese tradition together with practices and representations unique to the locality, was simply untouched by the elaborate 21Von Glahn has shown that the Five Routes (Wulu) was a euphemistic sobriquet for the generic Wuitong, which persisted in the Jiangnan region in the Ming and Qing (von Glahn 1991, 691). This suggests the intriguing possibility that the early liturgical texts discussed above may provide a common source linking these two sets of traditions.</page><page sequence="18">130 MICHAEL SZONYI subterfuge that developed around the identity of the deities in official and literati sources. The superscription of the Five Manifestations in official texts over popular understandings of the Five Emperors was to a very great extent illusory. This exploration highlights the centrality of local elites in mediating the flow of ideas both up and down the hierarchy of power. It was they who compiled the gazetteers which obscured the identity of the deities, and it was they, together with local officials, who were responsible for much of the criticism of popular beliefs and practices like the Five Emperors and their rituals. Watson has argued that while the state promoted officially sanctioned deities from above, local elites, looking to demonstrate their gentrification, promoted the same sanctioned deities on the ground (Watson 1985, 308-9). In Fuzhou, local people of different classes were all committed to a particular set of deities and practices, because it was these deities and practices that they saw as efficacious. The gods could be represented in a different guise when they were being written about for the outside world, to be sure, but local society would not accept the substitution of different state-sanctioned deities in their place. The Five Manifestations was used as a label for the Five Emperors cult, but never as an autonym of cult members themselves. In the mid-nineteenth century, a local official, Wu Rongguang, memorialized that the aid of the gentry and other local elites should be enlisted to assist state efforts to suppress the cult of the Five Emperors: [I) believe that in Fujian the established families and reputable lineages as well as those men who have even a little knowledge certainly do not follow these evil practices.... Fathers, elder brothers and those who are respected in the villages must restrain their sons and younger brothers, and admonish the foolish and stubborn. They should record family regulations, or establish village prohibitions. This will result in the customs being pure and good, there forever being no infractions in the law, and eternally make the people peaceful. (Fujian tongzhi 1871, 55:30b) Wu's instructions pose the dilemma for local elites in stark terms. On the one hand, they had to express their high degree of civilization through the conformity of their community to imperially sanctioned norms. On the other, they had to impose that conformity within limits that would be acceptable to themselves and their community. The textual productions of the local elite were an attempt to explain away apparent local variation by reference to a univeralist model. Did the local gentry genuinely equate the Five Emperors with the Five Manifestations? Probably some did. But Guo Bocang's gazetteer account, and his relative Guo Boyang's attempt to construct an alternative acceptable account of the deities, suggest that at least some of them were quite clear that two distinct traditions had become comingled. To the extent that the complete cultural integration of Chinese society across class lines was illusory, it was the ability of local elites to negotiate this dilemma so skilfully that accounts in large part for the success of the illusion. The role of local cults in Chinese cultural integration across regional lines was also much more complex than previous scholarship suggests. Watson argued that state sanctioning of particular deities led to the expansion of their cults at the expense of existing local cults (Watson 1985, 293 ff.). State patronage did indeed encourage local elites to claim that they worshipped particular deities, but this need not mean that these elites and the peasants around them actually gave up the worship of their</page><page sequence="19">THE ILLUSION OF STANDARDIZING THE GODS 131 local gods and substituted deities from the state-approved pantheon. The history of the Five Emperors of Fuzhou suggests that what happened was not that state-approved cults expanded, but that local cults were reshaped, manipulated, and represented to bring them in line, in certain contexts, with those approved cults. In the case of the Five Emperors faithfulness to existing local gods was legitimized by obscuring those deities under cover of state-sanctioned ones. If state sanction does not explain the spread of a cult, then what does? The sources suggest that key factors in the expansion of the cult were the movements of Fuzhou natives in the surrounding hinterland and beyond, and the efficacy of appeals to the deities to relieve outbreaks of disease-in other words, to the miracles performed by the deities in response to the needs of their believers in a time when pestilence was ever lurking. Finally, the importance of its various disguises in enabling the expansion of the cult should not be underestimated. Worship of the Five Emperors spread not because the state endorsed them, but because increasing numbers of people in more and more places found the deities efficacious in the prevention and cure of disease. Popular religion contributed to cultural integration not so much by standardizing the gods as by allowing the creation of a complex illusion of standardized gods. The repeated conflations between the local cult and a state-sanctioned one is a central part of the history of the cult of the Five Emperors. Each of these conflations indicates a new phase in the ongoing negotiation between local and translocal culture. The model of cult expansion, proposed by Watson and widely shared, of the straightforward linear dissemination of a state-sanctioned cult from a unique original cult center to the far reaches of the empire, may tell the whole story of the most powerful cults of the pantheon, such as Mazu and Guandi. But this study of the Five Emperors tells a different story, a story of the powerful resilience of local culture, of the construction of a complex illusion of standardization of national cults, and of the complicity of local elites in the construction of that illusion.
