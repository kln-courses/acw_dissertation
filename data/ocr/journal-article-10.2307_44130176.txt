JUDDING FROM DESCARTES, SANDBACKING, AND SEVERAL TUTTOLOGIES by John Lor mg During the last few years Pop artists and Post- Pop Realists have devoted their efforts in print to ever more elaborate refinements of technical virtuosity and iconographie complexity. The resultant multi-media mas- terworks epitomized by Rosenquist's Off the Continental Divide are of an eminent gener- osity in visual content, surface richness, and pure overall and overwhelming voluptuous- ness never before seen in the history of printmaking. Quite opposed to this aesthetic, Minimal and Post- Minimal artists have veered from their accustomed field of three-dimensional works to the production of a significant number of prints that are both extremely primitive in technique and astonishingly trivial in iconic terms. Yet, despite their physically insubstantial nature and sparse - ness of visual content, they have an unde- niably powerful and assertive presence that should not be ignored; that is, in fact, worthy of the considerable attention they command. Yet whatever superficial, formal similar- ities the prints of such artists as Donald Judd, Fred Sandback, and Richard Tuttle may have in common, their formal similar- ities are not a key to the power the prints have to engage us in their cause. Their in- dividual causes are drastically diverse despite a shared "Minimal" look that is visually arresting. That look can be formally analyzed and scientifically explained, but such efforts cannot lead far and can certain- ly not explain the aesthetic pleasure the works afford. The three-dimensional pieces of all three artists have in common a central interest in 165</page><page sequence="2">Fred Sandback, two of the Four Variations of Two Diagonal Lines , etchings (22-1/2x30 in.), 1976.

And there the similar- ities stop. One (Sandback) has a traditional insistence on the identity of "illusions" and "facts"; another (Judd) claims that his work denies all illusionism. One (again Judd) denies anthropomorphic scale in his art; another (Tuttle) bases everything on it. One (Judd) believes in the immediacy of external perception; the other two base much on the time-structured functions of memory. In- dividual rather than collective comparative analysis seems indicated for their prints. Judd's most recent and most powerful prints to date are a pair of simple woodcuts printed in black on Japan paper and sub- titled (Diptych). Although printed in 1975, they are impressed from blocks made by the artist in 1961 and must be considered in context of his work at that time, which was entirely two-dimensional but which none- theless records ideas to be given three-di- mensional form in the ensuing years of his production, ideas that have remained con- stant and are as valid to him in the recent printing of the wood blocks as they were at the time the blocks were cut 15 years ago.1 In the strong, saturated surfaces of the Dip- tych, modulated only incidentally by the grain of the blocks and in the equidistant, white, parallel lines routed from their sur- face, there is a clean and persuasive state- ment of Judd's conviction of the anti-illu- sionistic, non- anthropomorphic, non- hier- archical, unequivocally "exact," "specific," "stable" forms he believed art should take. This conviction was based on the idea cur- rent in American art for some time, and cer- tainly not unknown to European artists, that the "illusion" set up by the dualism of the picture plane and objects seen against that plane must be rejected by art and, by exten- sion, that all forms of "illusion" in art must be attacked not only for their inappropri - ateness to 20th-century art ideology but for their basic philosophical unsoundness. Judd's form of attack was concentrated on the "illusions" of perspective and foreshortening; and, in his eyes and in the eyes of his supporters and followers, he managed to "discredit Cartesianism" by creating "specific objects" or forms that "posited meaning as a function of external space"; the premise being that cogito-ergo- sum Cartesianism affirmed an identity bet- ween the real and the imaginary and there- fore attempted to suggest a space existing in the mind prior to experience and waiting to be filled by objects, a kind of imaginary isometric grid or psychological model of space waiting in the wings against which things would be imperfectly apprehended.2 Now that is all very well, but "discred- iting" Descartes is no mean feat, especially when jumping to conclusions and assump- tions about his philosophy he himself would have found it urgent to disown. As the publication of Diptych is actually the republication of a seminal work in Judd's theory and the conclusions drawn from it, a brief investigation of those conclusions is appropriate. The problem is obviously in the use of the concept of "illusion" and its equation to the function of "imagination." Without at- tempting to rehash a couple of hundred years of Western thought but to briefly outline what went on and the origin of the misuse of the concept of "illusion" that underlies the loose thought of much "Minimalist" philosophy of art and the literature it has provoked, it must be pointed out at the start that Descartes ad- mitted a possible distinction between ideas of sense and ideas of imagination but only if treated as ideas; and he found even that distinction "vicious," which it obviously is. Hobbes agreed, as did Spinoza and as did Leibnitz. Locke, in a moment of shocking sophism and confusion of the relationship of effect to cause, said that all sensa were real because caused by real things. Berkeley and Hume set about refuting this error. Kant agreed with them and so on.3 Much 20th- century art, however, sees a deplorable lack of "freedom" in all that common sense and 166</page><page sequence="3">flirts sporadically with Locke's type of sophism, aided by curious surface appeals to Ludwig Wittgenstein. Wittgenstein's logical proofs that all "meaning" comes from exter- nal experience and his investigation of lan- guage as a coefficient of the completely ex- ternal is of great brilliance in the firmament of Western thought but in no way "dis- credits" Cartesianism properly understood. Descartes never proposed that there was "meaning" or any possibility of thought without experience. No one reasonable pretended that sensation/ imagination was a mode of thought or contained intellectual ideas; and everyone would have agreed that "illusion" was a term meaning a mistake or error made about various sensa and their relationships, a deliberate misfunction of consciousness but not a mistake about the primary nature of external experience. Illu- sion belongs to the "second order laws" of the understanding of causes; imagination (or "sensation") to the "first order" of ex- perience itself. Wittgenstein especially would call the supposedly attacked concept of "illusion" a pseudo-concept without a variable name (like perspective, foreshorten- ing, optical illusion, etc.) to make it specific.4 It is not a function like "imagina- tion," and the two (concept and function) are in no way interchangeable in mean- ingful propositions. All this is based more on a grammatical misunderstanding than on a real argument, but it has obscured much real merit in Minimal art. So, with all due respect to Judd, the pro- position that his specific objects discredit Cartesianism is nonsensical. What they do do and what the very present and forceful forms of Diptych do is to present us with concrete and therefore visual facts that do not allow us to be led to false judgments as to their nature. There is no representation of the phenomenon of perspective or fore- shortening; there is no hierarchy of elements that might suggest spatial hierarchy; form is totally abstract; surface is unemotional as is line, and both only exist to physically define a specific concept in space. There is nothing to suggest they are "images" of anything; they are, like the later three-dimensional pieces, "specific objects." They insist on be- ing experienced not interpreted. If denial of optical "illusion" there must be, it is done negatively. There is nothing there to tempt us into error about the relationships of what we see. And, quite positively, there is a com- manding poetry to their complete congruity of idea and external fact. Quite opposed to Donald Judd, the next "Minimal" printmaker, Fred Sandback, feels entirely at ease with the isometric graph of diagrammatic space and its "illu- sion" and has repeatedly used isometric graph paper as a support for his drawings of spatial situations. His work has mainly con- sisted of stretched wires or acrylic strings that complicate actual experiential space. Their intention has been neither environ- mental nor architectural but to provoke a "consciousness" or space through the deliberate suggestion of illusions, their func- tion as optical illusions creating a "tension" between what is seen and what is explicitly suggested to lead consciousness away from the physical facts, a tension between the sim- ple lines that they are and the contours of potential volume or surface they imply. Sandback has unequivocally stated that he adheres to the view that "illusions are just as real as facts, and facts just as ephemeral as illusions." (One must assume that he too is using "illusion" to signify "ideas of im- agination" and "facts" to signify "ideas of sense," otherwise the statement is logically meaningless or perverse.) In the case of his many recent prints, although he has abandoned the isometric graphs and other specific spatial referents, he still cleaves to the traditional concept of pictorial space through the use of linear con- figurations that imply (provoke the illusion of) three dimensions. For him it is explicit that "surfaces seem to imply that what's in- teresting is either in front of them or behind them." Nothing could obviously be more traditional or further from the vision of Judd (although Judd's thinking is predicated on this tradition of painting), but this does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that Sand- back is a dishonest trickster guilty of out- rageous corruptions of consciousness. He simply chooses to think about things dif- ferently. The simple line configurations (often limited to no more than three lines) on the picture planes of his prints are not intended to, and cannot, force us into errors as to their real, physical nature. They are, how- ever, "images" of something (possible situa- tions in logical space), not "specific objects" like Judd's Diptych but "images," "shad- ows," placed between us and the experien- tial reality of the lines in space they intend to represent. We are quite free to falsely inter- pret their reality as we sense it, give in to op- tical illusion, and erringly believe in their three -dimensionality, or we can think cor- rectly about them as lines on a sheet of paper, or again we can not think about them at all. But this triple choice in experi- ence is, after all, their subject and is as suc- cessful in the two-dimensional prints as in the three-dimensional structures. The next printmaker, Richard Tuttle, although usually classed as a Post- Minimal artist, has little in common with Judd and his circle and, although talked about along with Sandback under the popular heading of "dematerialization in art," the term seems as meaningless as a key to his art as to the situational art of Sandback. Granted he makes strangely poignant and ephemeral things that are of very small scale and of flimsy construction, but that in itself is not interesting; the strong response that these "little things" elicit is. Writings on Tuttle - and there are many- dwell quite futilely on some middle road between painting and sculpture they see him pursuing for no explained reason, upon the "situational" nature of his work - although it has little to do really with figure/ground relationships - and on its "perceptually elusive" nature. One unequiv- ocally admiring critic felt it appropriate to term the work "difficult to see," and a less interested critic has described the typical Tuttle piece as "something about the size of a pencil and of considerable less visual in- terest." None of this gets very far. The probable truth is Richard is a poet, but a poet whose thinking goes in so many directions that its exact nature escapes</page><page sequence="4">Richard Tuttle, Diptych, screenprint (30x22 in. ea.), 1976. Courtesy Brooke Alexander, Inc. everyone, yet his efforts shout sincerity and justly attract a great deal of attention. This is not simplified by the fact that he is a slippery fellow when it comes to discussing his own work and either perversely refuses to understand the logic of language to poet- ically distort or expand it meaningfully or willfully convolutes it to obscure whatever he knowingly is about. Yet language is pro- bably at the very core of his work and something he probably understands very well. He is given to "Tuttologies" for lack of any preexisting terms. These run from whoppers like "Is it not enough to say that two divided by one are really three? That two elements in the round take up more space than three lined up one by one?" and on to "I have been searching for a benign difference between concrete abstraction and "abstract" concreteness." The first is either nonsense or a reckless and unsound if sincere stab at poetry; the second is clearly circular and "vicious" (to return to Descartes's term) rather than "benign." The propositions of both are not false but simply nonsensical and pose no real problems for art or philos- ophy. Their essentially "hermetic" nature has led to assertions of the "metaphysical" nature of Tuttle 's work, which again heads straight for far left field. Tuttle in "benignly" lucid moments has said that his aim is "to make something that looks like itself." In that endeavor, he is en- tirely successful, and any attempt to "ex- plain" the results or scientifically analyze or equate them to anything they specifically are not - tempting as that may be - will lead into a slough of metaphysical obscurity, fits of logical regression, and terminal brain fever. One must resist the centrifugal pull of circular thought, powerful as it is in current "art philosophy." For example: "Simplicity and complexity are virtually the same thing." "Since we don't know what white is it must be about color." "If it is not about all the things that art is not about it is art." Two of those are Tuttle's, and less of this kind of thing would be more. Like much of 20th-century art, what Richard Tuttle is dealing with in the prints and in the "pieces" is language and a loosely conceived concept of art as language in its original gestural and imaginative form. Not resorting to a known language, he creates a new one through what Marcia Tucker in her revealing essay prefacing the Whitney Museum catalogue of his 1975 retrospective calls "a choreographed enactment in time and space"; and here she gets to the heart of the matter: language in its primal form is made up of bodily gestures that give crude feelings expression and therefore (as has been frequently repeated) "dance is the mother of all language." All of Tuttle's works are the concrete results of "choreographies," sets of bodily gestures performed by the artist, "external" records, measurements of art/language ac- tivity taken from Tuttle's own body, which is the standard "measure of all things" in his work of communication. The lines of com- munication they set up are of a directness that is of such purity, sincerity, and "open- ness" of intention that they are at times deeply moving, even if confounding by their amorphous nature of effluence of feeling that has not yet taken form as thought. Their intangible and "foreign" nature, however, is not enigmatic. It does not invite us to throw ourselves over the cliffs of con- jecture, but rather it invites us to share in an external experience of consciousness. The works are connecting signs (possibly preposi- tions) through which the artist and viewer are each at once related as both subject and object. As art/ language signs they are non-si tua tional; they "mean" precisely what they are, independent of position. (They are not science.) The prints, as all Tuttle's works, are the concrete records of choreographies: of a pendular swing of the hand controlled by a loop of string in In Praise of Economic Determinism-, of a premeditated number of cross-hatched layerings in In Praise of Historical Determinism I and //; of 12 dif- ferent hand and arm movements predicated on the space and geometries of a printed rectangle with the mid-points of its sides ar- ticulated in the book Interlude-, of printing a hyphenating bar (another concrete "prep- osition") joining two otherwise blank sheets of paper at a fixed point where their uneven deckle edges are positioned to touch in Dip- tych. These choreographed marks have some- thing of an arbitrary notation at times, which could lead away from their intention, but at other times they relate to precise ideas. The relation of a pendular swing and "economic determinism" is obvious and its notation playfully direct. In In Praise of Historical Determinism, the internal rela- tion of the dark blue of one sheet to the lighter blue of the next and the external relation of the third and yellow sheet, which is meant not to be framed but to be propped against the wall to the right of the first two sheets, and the relation of these internal and external properties to "historical deter- minism" is possibly more obscure but still logically understandable. (It could well spring once more from Wittgenstein's teach- ings as it is coincidently the color blue that Wittgenstein chose for his example of "inter- nal properties" in the Tractatus 4.123!) These more "readable prints are, how- ever, less moving than the 12 pages of In- terlude or Diptych, where the notation may at first seem less important, more "Mini- mal," but where the mode of signifying, of expressing a primitive feeling about the self as apprehended in external experience, is strongly felt as a "possible" sign for ex- perience, where the possibility proposed by the individual sign can tell us something of the essence of communciation. 1 See specifically Seven Gray Stripes on a Thickened Red Ground : Untitled Painting (1961-62), illustrated in Art in America, May- June 1975, p. 40. 2 For a very intelligent and complete statement of this point of view, see Rosalind Krauss, "Sense and Sensibility," Artforum, November 1973, pp. 43-53. 3 For a complete discussion, see Book II: The Theory of Imagination in R.
