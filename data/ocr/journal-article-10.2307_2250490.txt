[The " ultimate categories " are not Platonic Forms or Hegelian Categories but are, perhaps, " interest; . . . instrument; and satisfaction or unity; all other forms and ideas . . . being subordinate and functional."] Rudd Fleming. Of Contrast between Tragedy and Comedy. [Considers " comedy and tragedy as dividing between themselves the two types of incongruity which, perhaps, in the moral and social world are the most universally and deeply interesting-disproportionate good fortune, the source of unreasonable confidence, and disproportionate misfortune, the source of undirected and destructive fear."] 21. A Symposium of Reviews of John Dewey's "Logic: The Theory of Inquiry." Evander Bradley McGilvary. [How would he prove his central thesis that the " only view that provides a consistent logical interpretation " of some of the " facts " is that logical forms are not " forms of the subject-matter under investigation " but are " only modes of operating upon subject-matter under investigation."] G. Watts Cunningham. [Picks out of Dewey's book a formidable array of quotations which, he says, are equivalent to saying that " relations of implication obtain only within some sort of subject-matter ", which, therefore, " is the condition of inference ". Draws attention to the explicit repudiation by idealist logic of the notion " that the subject is given 'ready-made ' ".] C. I. Lewis. [Agrees with Dewey that " meaning, apart from some possible action and the reality in which it should eventuate, is a fictitious entity and not found in human thinking,". " Each possible verification turns out, on 'examination, to be some eventuality which will accrue or not accrue according as we adopt or refuse to adopt some attitude or course of action." Therefore " that 'universal determinism' sometimes supposed to be an essential presupposition of science is not something to be judged false or true but merely a pedantic fable; such that even if admitted in words it could find no application to any actual situations in which a human investigator has a real purpose in prosecuting an inquiry ".] Ernest Nagel. [(1) Dewey does not, as is often alleged, confuse the validity of a notion with its genesis. (2) Comparison of his distinction between "generic " and " universal " propositions with the widespread distinction between " syn- thetic " and " analytic " propositions.] 22. Lewis E. Hahn. Neutral, Indubitable Sense-data as the Starting Point for Theories of Perception. [Many careful philosophers doubt whether there are sense-data, so how can Price hold that their existence is indubitable ? Starting with them has the disadvantage of requiring us to postulate for example the innate a priori idea of material thinghood and an innate power of expecting it to apply to sense-data.] Virgil C. Aldrich. Two Hundred Years After Hume's " Treatise " ["Hume would want to temper the extreme emphasis (of current positivism) on syntactical construction and re- construction of languages with an infusion of a greater 'feel' and respect for the determinants of language itself, such as the items and orders of 24</page><page sequence="2">362 PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. elementary experience or the habits formed by responsiveness to them. Since this is the direction in which current positivism is already turning, . . . Hume would salute it as the result of logical refinements of his own."] 23. David F. Bowers. The Role of Subject-Matter in Art. [" Subject-matter is an important esthetic factor in all the arts, and both the traditional artistic practice of introducing subject-matter and the traditional critical practice of expecting its introduction are esthetically valid and important." " It is very likely true that subject-matter some- times enhances the esthetic design of the surface (of a picture) without changing the design in any way " and sometimes also changes the design for the better.] 24. Percy Hughes. The Technique of Philosophic Explanation. [". . . narratives of explanation present a discontinuity which in some way we find pervaded by an underlying continuity of action." " These continuities are of three chief types, ' corporal sub- stances', persons, and societies." " When we explain an occurrence as the fulfilment of a tendency, the prior existence of that tendency must be established on grounds that are quite independent of that alleged fulfilment."] Roger Hazelton. Human Purpose and Cosmic Purpose. [Asserts the existence of cosmic purpose in the sense that (1) conditions sometimes support intentional modifications made by human organisms, and (2) some realised intentions have already left their mark on the objective order.] 25. Abstracts of Papers to be read at the Joint Meeting of the Eastern and Western Divisions of the American Philosophical Associ- ation, December, 1939. [Sixteen papers.] Jared S. Moore. Why a Realism of Universals ? [" . . . if we have any right to call all dandelions ' yellow', that right can be justified only on the ground that the universe of all that in any sense 'is' includes among its constituents such an entity as yellowness as truly and as objectively as it does yellow dandelions."] 26. Willard V. Quine. Designation and Existence. [" The nominalist . . .claims that a language adequate to all scientific purposes can be framed in such a way that its variables admit only concrete objects as values." " But if the nominalist cannot supply the relevant contextual definitions, then his nominalism forbids his use of variables having abstract entities as values. He will perhaps still plead that his apparent abstract entities are merely convenient fictions; but this plea is no more than an incantation, a crossing of the fingers, so long as the required contextual definitions are not forthcoming."] Robert Francis Greegan and George Boas. Insight, Habituation, and Enjoyment. [Discussion of Boas, 19 supra.] PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE, vi, 3 (July, 1939). W. M. Malisoff. What is an Atom ? [A plea for improvement in vocabulary and habits of thought. " ' Atomic ' will mean ' pertaining to the atom ', ' atomistic ' will mean 'pertaining to a reducibility to something indivisible'." " Atom " and " structure " are to be used as " conjugate " terms. " The analysis is the total situation and it factors into two abstractions: the atom (structureless) and the structure (non-atom). . . . To prevent misunderstanding, then, one should speak of atomistic-structural aiialysis."] W. Seifriz. A Materialistic Interpretation of Life. [" The uniqueness of living matter, that which distinguishes it from the non-living, rests on structural features resident in the proteins of protoplasm. These structural features are char- acterised by a co-ordination of parts which make of living matter an organised and harmonious whole." " In ascribing the attribute of living to an organised state of matter characterised by structural continuity and</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 363 a specific arrangement of parts, living matter is elevated to a plane above the non-living world without the introduction of any vitalistic concepts." (A well-balanced discussion, with interesting references to recent biological research.)] R. B. Winn. Is Nature Rational ? [". . . rationality in- variably implies adjustment and should be defined in its terms, lest our knowledge be obscured by mysticism and anthropomorphism. That is to say, we should define rationality as a form of adjustment, not vice versa. In referring to an instance of rationality in nature, the idealist actually deals with a case of adjustment. But he is not satisfied with this scientific name. . . . He chooses to call a natural thing by a name that would put himself and his kind on a pedestal. That is how he finds reason in the Cosmos."] H. S. Fries. Physics, A Vicious Abstraction. [" . . . the 'truths' of physics (and, a fortiori, of the other sciences) must be acknow- ledged by a thoroughgoing relativism to be based upon a very shaky founda- tion until we can see progress as clearly in the development of our concrete ideas of the good life as we have seen it in the development of physics as an 'isolated' subject."] C. D. Hardie. Our Knowledge of Other Minds. [Claims to have found an answer to the question, " What grounds have I for believing in the existence of other minds ? ", which, unlike traditional answers, will satisfy the following criteria: (1) My knowledge of other minds is certain, (2) I know that other bodies have minds in the same sense in which my own body has a mind. The argument is based upon a consideration of the manner in which ideal elements are used in a scientific theory. Following Campbell, Hardie distinguishes between the 'hypo- thesis' (a misleading word) and the 'dictionary' of a scientific theory. " The hypothesis consists largely of statements about mathematical vari- ables and the dictionary consists of statements connecting these variables to observable phenomena." Emphasis is laid upon the fact that not all statements of a scientific theory need be capable of translation, via the dictionary, into observation statements. It is sufficient that, of the con- sequences of the hypothesis, some should be so translatable. Now 'other minds ' are introduced to ' explain ' the observed behaviour of other bodies in a manner closely analogous to the introduction of molecules, say, into the kinetic theory of gases. The analogy is pursued in detail, and ap- plications are made to the controversy between purposive and non-pur- posive psychology and also to the psycho-analytic conception of the un- conscious.] T. I. Cook. Science: Natural and Social. [". . . perhaps the worst consequence of the impact of relativity theory and of the in- determinacy principle in the world of the social scientist has been that these have combined with the findings of modern psychology as to the non- rational elements in man to lead to a strange belief, not simply that be- haviour and the universe alike are irrational, but that reason itself is a useless tool. Thus science, which, whatever the paradoxes involved in its pursuit, has depended on and had faith in reason as a necessary tool, itself has been employed, subtly and unwittingly, in the support of the revolt against reason. . . ."] C. Kluckohn. The Place of Theory in Anthropological Studies. [A well-documented protest against the pre- occupation of American anthropologists with description and the collection of facts.] A. Lesser. Research Procedure and Laws of Culture. [Analyses a number of "normal expectations " revealed by, but not explicitly formulated in, the work of the research anthropologist. " If we turn for laws to the expectations of the scientist at work, the instrumental char- acter of such laws is immediately apparent." " In relation to laws as hypotheses or working expectations, the case which is studied at any time</page><page sequence="4">364 PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. becomes the experiment by means of which the hypotheses are verified or disproved." " The constant emphasis in social sciences upon research is then seen in its true light. It serves the function of experiment in other sciences, viz. that hypotheses or laws are being checked and verified by the conditions in a specific case."] W. H. Werkmeister. Natural Languages as Cultural Indices. [If languages are classified as " prefix-languages " and " suffix-languages ", correlation can be established between the type of language used and the type of culture (mother-right, father-right, etc.) in which it is used. ". . . the correlation of language types and culture types, as here suggested, is positive and is sufficiently well established to deserve serious consideration. Natural languages are cultural indices."] Discussion (Correspondence). Reviews and Notes. vi, 4 (October, 1939). W. M. Malisoff. What is a Gene ? [A sequel to the article, What is an Atom ? in the previous number. " A gene, then, can be looked upon as an atom with a history or a life span or a career or simply as an atom with a, past, present, and future." A " gene ", in this generalised sense, is the provisional terminus of that type of scientific analysis which stresses func- tion. All scientific systems can be regarded as terminating in the con- struction of genes: " when properly analysed they can show something which will play relative to that analysis the role of an indivisible with a, history and something which we can call the function of that indivi- sible . . . " .] A. G. Ramsperger. What is Scientific Knowledge ? [" Knowledge is the recognition of the way in which one sort of object is connected with, or enters into, the rest of nature. It is a grasp of the circumstances under which nature will exhibit herself in this or that par- ticular form." " To know an object is to be correct about what it im- ports." " Scientific knowledge does not differ from everyday knowledge by having to do with a different realm of objects; it differs only in the degree of abstraction it involves, the methods and techniques it employs and the generality of its results."] L. A. Dexter. Causal Imputation and Purposes of Investigation. [Defines cause as " that which, if an antecedent, if altered, will produce a result which we wish ".]- R. W. Sellars. A Clarification of Critical Realism. [A restatement, directed more par- ticularly against Dewey and logical positivists. " Vive epistemology and ontology ! Let us be philosophers again in the full sense of the term."I A. C. Benjamin. Science and Vagueness. [Points out three factors which contribute to the vagueness of symbols: (1) vagueness of the pointing gesture (or any alternative method of ostensive definition), (2) complexity in the symbol's referend, (3) the need to ensure that symbols shall apply to cases not included in the finite class of samples on which an ostensive definition is based. " If I prefer a vocabulary which is exact but extensive I shall insist that the future cases of red must be exactly like the past cases- under which conditions I may find that I shall never experience any cases of red at all. Or if I prefer a vocabulary which is vague but limited I shall insist that the future cases of red may be anything very loosely resembling the past cases-under which conditions I may find that everything I ex- perience is red. The point is that I recognise the claim of the future even when I define my symbol in the first place by reference to observed cases. I purposely leave a fringe of indefiniteness around every symbol in order to allow me to select at some future time that horn of the dilemma which seems most appropriate." The bearing of this analysis upon operationalist theories of the nature of scientific concepts is examined. " Vague ideas are part and parcel of science, and any theory of meaning which denies them is not a theory of science."] E. Vivas Value and Fact. [Argues</page><page sequence="5">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 365 that " there is no exclusively philosophical problem of value ". "The dichotomy therefore between fact and value must be abandoned on two grounds. Values are facts, since they can be verified, controlled, changed empirically. But facts are always valuable since they are always sought for in response to an interest."] A. Hofstadter and J. C. C. McKinsey. On the Logic of Imperatives. [By "imperatives " is intended laws, in- junctions, commands, etc. A directive is any imperative " which includes an indication of the agent who is to carry it out "; a fiat is any imperative which is not a directive. An imperative is satisfied " if what is commanded is the case ", while it is correct " if what it requires ought, or ought not, to be the case ". The authors are mainly concerned to show how a calculus of indicative sentences (Carnap's Language I of The Logical Syntax of Language being taken as an illustrative example) can be extended to include imperatives. They restrict the calculus to fiats and their satisfaction. The symbols and axioms needed in order to supplement Carnap's system in this way are set out in detail. The main theorem of the new calculus is that each fiat is equipollent to an indicative sentence, which " amounts to saying that all imperative-connectives can always be eliminated from a sentence ". Some discussion of the correctness of imperatives is appended.] M. C. Nahm. The Philosophical Implications of Some Theories of Emotion. [A defence of William James's theory (suitably modified in the light of recent physiological and psychological research). Argues that " the emotions are constituted of observable behaviour, the limits of which are 'instinct' and 'mood', the behaviour varying directly in intensity from overt action to peripheral reaction and inversely with the alternative modes of action implied in the organism's 'images' (i.e. stimuli effective for it), implying epistemologically the operation of an inherited Apper- cepzionsmass and necessitating for complete explanation ateleological and teleological definition ". Special attention is devoted to Cannon's thalamic theory of emotion. (A long and closely reasoned paper, with many critical references to other books and papers.)] Discussion (Correspon- dence). Reviews and Notes. vii, 1 (January, 1940). W. M. Malisoff. What is a Monad&gt;? [Follows two previous articles by the same author entitled What is an atom ? and What is a gene ? Defines a monad as " a gene with a private character ". " Phenomena of clairvoyance, telepathy, and the like, if only they were facts, would be possibly explainable as monadistic introspection in a democracy of monads."] 0. Lee. Philosophy and Science. [The subject-matter of philosophy is constituted by " the generic traits or cate. gories of experience and action ". Its method " is characterized by in- sight and abstraction " and issues in " certainties ". "Examples are the existence of the subject in a sense that escaped Hume, the existence of the external world and of causality in a sense that escaped both Berkeley and Hume, and the existence of virtue in a sense that escaped Protagoras."] A. Lapan. The Purpose of Philosophy. [A terse article which hardly bears further condensation. " The reconstruction of living so that it will have the utmost value is the primary objective of philosophy." " Phil- osophy . . . is generated by moral behaviour, habitual and unexamined, and issues in moral behaviour, rational and self-conscious." " Philosophy then, is a discernment of the conditions on which consequences depend, and a reflection upon the good and evil of those consequences." "' The existence of the moral order becomes questionable only when the good is identified with particular moral ideas."] D. L. Miller. Two Kinds of Certainty. [Regards Morris' distinction between the syntactic, semantic</page><page sequence="6">366 PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. and pragmatic levels of meaning as relevant to the distinction between " practical " and " logical " certainty.] P. W. Bridgman. Science: Public or Private ? [Uses the phrase " science is public " as abbreviation for the view that confirmation of scientific propositions is primarily based on the consensus of expert judgment. Bridgman thinks this aspect of scientific method has been over-emphasised. Science involves personal activity-" the requirement that I impose on myself in general is that I be able to adapt myself with success to my environment, and the decision as to whether I have made the adaptation is one which I make and which no other can possibly make for me ". That this view has non- trivial consequences, Bridgman shows by discussing an example from formal logic: " . . . every syllogism involves implicitly a ' text ' or body of comments as to meaning and use. . . . The text imposes conditions. I have to be aware of these conditions as I perform the process in which I am guided by the marks on paper. . . . This checking and awareness is private; no one can do it for me ". His contrast between the " private" and " public " aspects of science is connected with " the unavoidably dual character of many of the words that we use in describing what happens to us and to our fellows ".] J. E. Turner. The Distinction between " Mechanics " and " Mechanism ". [The widespread view that modern physics has refuted a mechanistic view of the universe in favour of ideas "akin to what we know in our own experience as life, will and freedom" is based on a confusion between " mechanics " and " mechan- ism ". The former is properly applicable to Newtonian mechanics alone; but the idea of mechanism is wider, as shown by the fact that electrical systems cannot be adequately described in terms of Newtonian mechanics. Mechanisms and organisms are closely connected. " It may be, in fact, that life and mind, or perhaps the spiritual as such, can manifest or express themselves only by means of those adequately intricate and delicate mechanisms, in the modern and non-Newtonian sense of this term, with which nature is indubitably and inexhaustively endowed."] T. A. Goudge. Peirce's Treatment of Induction. [Peirce emphasised the importance of sampling. In order to be truly random'it must be subject to " predesigna- tion " i.e., we must decide what the characteristic is for which we pro- pose to sample before the sample is taken. In discussing the justification of induction Peirce rejects Laplace's rule of succession and Mill's principle of the uniformity of nature. Induction is a self-corrective process, " which in the course of operation gradually eliminates its own errors ". (Goudge points out that this doctrine is inadequate, but hardly allows enough space for criticism.)] E. Nagel. Charles S. Peirce, Pioneer of Modern Empiricism. [An address commemorating the hundredth anniversary of Peirce's, birth, read to the Fifth International Congress for the Unity of Science, September, 1939. In spite of Peirce's "life-long polemic against positivisms of the type of Comte and Pearson ", he is a spiritual ancestor of contemporary logical empiricism. His "pragmatic maxim, proposed as a method for clarifying ideas ", has the same general intention as the principle of verifiability. And his successors might with advantage give more attention to his " emphasis upon the contexts in which terms occur and upon the complex of relevant practices involved in their use "; " . .- . an adequate empiricism can not afford to neglect Peirce's emphasis upon habits of action or to concentrate entirely upon the reduction of one set of statements to others ". Peirce's " fallibilism " (refusal to accept incorrigible statements) and " common-sensism " (" that in any enquiry we must plunge into medias res with all the beliefs and prejudices we</page><page sequence="7">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 367 actually have ") are also in the spirit of modern empiricism. And his views on induction suggest promising lines of inquiry. " Were he still among us he would surely have endorsed the happy marriage of the cultivation of logic and the empirical temper which distinguishes this movement."] B. Waters. Particulars, Universals and Verification. [". . . verification is always in terms of both particulars and universals." "Without universals community of meaning would be impossible." " We may define a universal as 'a shared definition that is numerically ex- pressible '." (An unhappy blend of opinions variously held by Russell, Stebbing, Ayer, C. I. Lewis and Carnap.)] L. J. Lafleur. The Fluxive Fallacy. [". . . that error which exists when the meaning of a phrase or philosophical position is indefinite, having two or more incompatible interpretations, and when some of the disadvantages inherent in the philosophy can be met by one of the possible interpretations and other disadvantages by other interpretations." Illustrations are drawn from Kant, Fichte, Socrates, Freud and Descartes.] A. V. Bushkovitch. Some Consequences of the Positivistic Interpretation of Physics. [". . . the positivistic view has been, and remains, the guiding philosophy of quantum mechanics in its most fruitful period." " Physics thus becomes not so much an experimental science, as a 'laboratory ' science, or the behaviour of certain . . . very interesting instruments producing very startling effects, and often leading to the construction of highly useful devices."] K. H. Niebyhl. Modern Mathematics and Some Problems of Quantity, Quality and Motion in Economic Analysis. [An obscure paper, concerned with the bearing of modern views of the nature of mathematics (mostly regarded as defective) upon economics. Lewin's system of " topological psychology " is commended: " he has made the first practical attempt to devise a scientific language which allows for the presentation of processes in motion ". But phrases like " the problem- atics of mechanics ", "hodological descriptions of economic problems " and (Brouwer's) "imposing structure of the concept of time " tend to baffle the reader.] E. Zilsel. History and Biological Evolution. [Finds a behaviouristic criterion for distinguishing history from biology in the relative orders of magnitude of the velocity of change in the two fields. " The realm of history comprehends human occurrences and their causes which are slower by one degree than the reactions of the individuals and faster by one degree than 1iological evolution." The higher velocity of historical change is associated with the social character of historical process and its dependence upon the relatively plastic character of human traditions.] Discussion (Correspondence).
