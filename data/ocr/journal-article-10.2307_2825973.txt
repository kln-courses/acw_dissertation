<plain_text><page sequence="1">WORLD GUIDE TO MAMMALS. By Nicole Duplaix and Noel Simon; Introduction by Prue and John Napier; illustrations by Peter Barrett. Crown Publishers, New York. $15.95. ii + 283 p.; ill.; index. 1977. While this is a sumptuously prepared and hand- somely illustrated book, it is only fair to state that the printed contents do not live up to the pictorial style. The species illustrated are superbly done: the paint- ings are lifelike and usually true in color- not over- colored as is so often the case. For most families of mammals there are illustrations of a considerable number of species, but even among the larger mam- mals there are omissions. One is likely to be hypercrit- ical when finding some favorite species not illustrated, but for a book in color, 275 species is not a bad count. The selection is by no means limited to the larger species; insectivores and rodents are given a fair rep- resentation. The pictures are what sell this book, for the text is minimal. It is claimed that there are descriptions of 812 species, but many of these are only named. As a rule, distribution maps are given only for the pictured species or else are inclusive for all species of a certain type- ibexes, for example. For some species a cer- tain amount of life-history information is given, but the treatment is very uneven, and there is not much that cannot be found in other sources, often in more detail. Such information as is given is authoritative. For this reason, alone, the book will be a good one for introducing young folk to the mammals, since they will not be started out on anthropomorphic folk tales. For this and for its fine illustrations, this is a good introduction to mammals for the juvenile reader. BYRAN P.
