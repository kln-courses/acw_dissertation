<plain_text><page sequence="1">Language and Reality in Abraham J. Heschel's Philosophy of Religion EDWARD K. KAPLAN IN MEMORIAM: Abraham Joshua Heschel (1907-1972) The relation of inner spiritual life to traditional theological and philo- sophical categories is the dynamic foun- dation of Abraham J. Heschel's reli- gious thought. Not systematic in form, nor objectively philosophical in intent, his writings have suffered from lack of scholarly attention in great part because their consistent conceptual framework is not immediately apparent. The beauty of his style, however, has been recognized, though often to the detri- ment of serious consideration of the in- tellectual system implicit in his vision. His texts have indeed been appreciated as devotional literature by Christians as well as Jews because of the vitality of their poetry. Close scrutiny reveals that Heschel's use of language follows a coherent and explicit theory which, though dispersed in different works, is rigorous and susceptible to critical un- derstanding. An account of Heschel's linguistic assumptions can clarify his interpretation of religious tradition, with the broader benefit of helping us to participate in the spiritual awareness which his personal witness should con- vey. Heschel's endeavor is founded upon a logical contradiction which his theory of poetic language seeks to harmonize. On the one hand, he attempts to evoke in his reader authentic religious in- sights - which are, in essence, ineffa- ble - by expressing his own experience in passages of great poetic beauty. On the other hand, he presents a concep- tualized description of man's relation to God using accepted theological and philosophical categories as points of reference. The very tension which this paradox involves is at the root of reli- gious understanding in Heschel's sys- EDWARD K.

HESCHEL'S PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION 95 tem: "The sense for the power of words and the sense for the impotence of hu- man expression are equally character- istic of the religious consciousness" (Man's Quest, p. 41).1 Poetry, in Hes- chel's sense, refers not to mere verse, prose sentences chopped into rimes and rhythms, but an imaginative manner of experiencing language. His theory and use of poetic discourse are meant to dis- turb our habitual thought patterns and evoke our sense of the ineffable, the bud of spiritual awareness. It is at the gates of poetic participa- tion in religious language that the be- liever and the faithless meet. For the pious reader privileged with faith, Hes- chel's writings represent an example of enrichment for his inner participation with the sacred content of accepted ob- servance. The pious man is blessed with a pre-established power of em- pathy with which to illumine theologi- cal concepts. The reader deprived of solid faith may also find in Heschel a spiritual ideal to be pursued. Both ex- periences require understanding the structure and function of poetic lan- guage: the former, to project intimate emotions into traditional behavior of- ten dessicated and rendered uncon- scious by habit; the latter, to enable one to experience empathically and im- aginatively the phenomena of faith con- tained in traditional words. Perhaps the relative success of religious lan- guage can be ascertained when both such individuals achieve a common awareness of how God might function in their lives. Heschel's manner of thinking con- fronts the spiritual apathy of religious institutions and the complacency of theological thought by challenging us to experience for ourselves pre-theo- logical situations of ultimate insight: "The categories of religious thinking ... are unique and represent a way of thinking on a level that is deeper than the level of concepts, utterances, sym- bols. It is immediate, ineffable, meta- symbolic" (In Search, p. 103).2 His poetic style, if understood with sensi- tivity, can arouse in us a sense of God's 1 Parenthetical references to the following of Heschel's books are cited in this article: Man Is Not Alone: A Philosophy of Religion (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1966; orig. pub. 1951) [hereafter Not Alone]; The Sabbath: Its Meaning for Modern Man, expanded edition (New York: Farrar, Strauss &amp; Co., 1951, 1952) [Sabbath]; Man's Quest for God: Studies in Prayer and Symbolism (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1954) [Man's Quest]; God in Search of Man: A Philosophy of Judaism (New York: Meridian Books, 1964; orig. pub. 1955) [In Search]; The Prophets (New York and Evanston: Harper &amp; Row, 1962) [Prophets].

KAPLAN presence in biblical words, and can help us to actualize the non-symbolic, divine content of ritual and moral acts. Hes- chel's demands are a touchstone by which to judge the authenticity of our religious lives. The firm certainty of his faith disturbs the modern seeker, timid and uncertain about belief; but at the same time Heschel reminds us to keep alive within us a personal need to confirm God's reality, the growing edge of religion itself. THE LIMITS OF LANGUAGE Heschel's discussion of the validity of language insists upon the limits of conceptual understanding in religious experience. Formulations of belief are never as vital and dynamic as a primary insight: "[The theoretician] does not seem to realize that idolization of ideas leads to an atrophy of the intuition of the ineffable; that God may be lost in our creed" (Not Alone, p. 98). Hes- chel's special concern is to preserve a sense of divine presence in our lives by stressing God's transcendence with re- gard to man's thought. Especially in the domain of religious discourse, an attempt to identify human expression with transcendent reality is, for Hes- chel, perilous impiety: "There is hardly a symbol which, when used, would not impair or even undo the grasp or remembrance of the incomparable. Opinions confuse and stand in the way of intuitions; surveys, definitions take the name of God in vain. We have neither an image nor a definition of God. We have only His name. And the name is ineffable" (ibid., p. 97). Heschel rejects "symbolic knowl- edge," or theological conceptualization, because it represents in large part "an act of accommodation [of reality] to the human mind" (In Search, p. 116). This attack on linguistic positivism which apprehends language as an ade- quate expression of the clearly known leads to a more specific condemnation of concepts, that is, of their function as a mode of pictorial representation: "Few of us are able to think in a way which is never crossed by the path of imagination, and it is usually at the crossroads of thought and imagination that the great sweep of the spirit swerves into the blind alley of a para- bolic image" (ibid., p. 187).3 Human weakness substitutes static images for intuitions of reality. The intellectual arrogance of dogmatic theology is a form of linguistic idolatry to be es- chewed if one is to be satisfied with nothing less than an actual relation to a living God. This assault on imagery, both verbal and graphic, does not, how- ever, lead to an absolute refusal to com- municate. Heschel is simply rejecting a literal apprehension of such represen- tations which replace experience of re- ality itself. Poetry is Heschel's solution to this intellectual bind, for it can pre- serve the social cohesion of a common language while also suggesting the fluid relation of words to reality. Heschel's insistance on the limits of language emphasizes more clearly the positive value of that which cannot be SA basic opposition in Heschel's philosophy is one between space and time in religious awareness, which may be considered in this context as a distinction between mediated (sym- bolic) and immediate, or intuitive understanding. Space is the world of external experience, while time is felt inwardly and more directly. In religious thinking he demands such in-</page><page sequence="4">ABRAHAM J. HESCHEL'S PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION 97 expressed ordinarily: "To become aware of the ineffable is to part com- pany with words. The essence, the tangent curve of human experience, lies beyond the limits of language" (Not Alone, p. 16).4 Hence, "creed is but the adaptation of the uncommon spirit to the common mind. Our creed is, like music, a translation of the unut- terable into a form of expression. The original is known to God alone" (ibid., p. 167). Man's incapacity to account for reality as it is bares the dilemma of using a common denotative language to convey that which surpasses all hu- man categories. Heschel's emphasis on the ineffable stresses the God-side, not the world-side, of the religious event. The creative function of religious lan- guage is precisely, by the music (or poetry) of words, to suggest to man a realm of greater being. Given the impossibility of absolute expressiveness in religious discourse, one can adopt two basic attitudes. The most radical and uncompromising is the via negativa, a refusal to render even a hint of the ineffable, and Hes- chel is well aware of this strict stan- dard: "Silence is preferable to speech. Words are not indispensable to cogni- tion. They are only necessary when we wish to communicate our ideas to others or to prove to them that we have attained cognition" (In Search, p. 123).6 Silence, though metaphysi- cally pure, does not admit verbal pres- ervation. In making silence our goal we would negate at once the commu- nity of intimate sharing and all litera- ture of religious tradition. Some com- promise must be made with the abso- lute in order to bring people together. For this reason Heschel commits himself to a second approach to the limits of religious statement: a struggle to communicate the ineffable--the re- sult of a deeply inward and individual encounter-in linguistic terms shared by society. His philosophy should lead to a renewal of our capacity to think religiously: Philosophy of religion must be an effort to recall and to keep alive the meta-symbolic relevance of religious terms. Religious thinking is in perpetual danger of giving primacy to concepts and dogmas and to for- feit the immediacy of insights, to forget that the known is but a reminder of God, that dogma is a token of His will, the ex- pression the inexpressible at its minimum. Concepts, words must not become screens; they must be regarded as windows (ibid., p. 116). Faced with the alternative of silence, the philosopher who enjoys authentic religious insight and wants to com- ward purity: "The primitive mind [and the intellectual conceptual mind] finds it hard to realize an idea without the aid of imagination, and it is in the realm of space where imagina- tion wields its sway (Sabbath, p. 4). 'The passage continues by linking language as representation (sign) of the phenomenal world to the world itself as mere appearance: "The world of things we perceive is but a veil. Its flutter is music, its ornament science, but what it conceals is inscrutable" (Not Alone, p. 16). It is not that physical life is pure illusion (e.g., the maya of Hinduism). Rather, music and science are not to be considered as ends in themselves, but as two ap- propriate reactions to an intuition of the unknown. Heschel interprets the world as an allusion to God (see ibid., Ch. III, pp. 19-24). SOn pp. 122-123 of In Search Heschel cites Maimonides on the limits of man's verbal understanding of God. Cf. Man's Quest, pp. 41-44 on silence as a component of worship.</page><page sequence="5">98 EDWARD K. KAPLAN municate it is faced with a logical con- tradiction: He must employ traditional religious terms, with all their dogmatic and conceptual presuppositions, and yet actualize their non-symbolic con- tent. He must take a language com- posed of concepts frozen by specific interpretations and dynamize it, using it to surpass itself. In his conception and use of poetic language Heschel de- velops an intellectually viable religious vocabulary while, at the same time, opening the soul of his reader to in- tuitions, using words as windows rather than as closed doors. Heschel's paradox can be stated thus: "It is precisely the challenge in- volved in using inadequate words that drives the mind beyond all words" (Prophets, p. 276). His challenge to us requires both an intellectual au- dacity in becoming detached from cherished ideas and beliefs and a will- ingness to attempt unique procedures of validating his statements. Examina- tion of the positive powers of language should provide a clearer ground on which to exercise our insight in study- ing Heschel's exposition.6 POETIC DISCOURSE AND RELIGIOUS REALITY Heschel thus warns us that in re- ferring to the ineffable, we must avoid ordinary denotative language, for it cannot express the essence of man's insights; its function is to signify (rep- resent) only the known aspects of reality. The successful denotative word is unequivocal and concrete. Poetry, on the other hand, creates a world of its own. Its words are most often am- biguous, polysemantic, polyvalent and function through suggestion. Heschel accordingly affirms that poetry is the most valid medium in which to ex- press religious insights: To intercept the allusions that are submerged in perceptibilities, the interstitial values that never rise to the surface, the indefinable dimension of all existence, is the venture of true poetry. That is why poetry is to re- ligion what analysis is to science, and it is certainly no accident that the Bible was not written more geometrico but in the lan- guage of poets (Not Alone, p. 37).' Heschel firmly opposes an exclusively literal interpretation of the Bible, that is, when "literal" means to construe biblical images in a non-figurative, un- equivocal and precise sense. Does this mean, however, that such images are not to be taken seriously, that they have no "meaningful positive con- tent"?8 If this phrase means scientifi- cally or systematically verifiable, then no, for that would require us to test the Bible from our secure human perspec- STo evaluate the validity of Heschel's demonstration, one must first isolate and define his levels of discourse-- e.g., intuitively poetic, logical, polemic - and then examine his "proofs" within the general structure of each book. See the proposal of Fritz A. Roths- child, "The Religious Thought of Abraham Heschel," Conservative Judaism, XXIII, No. 1 (Fall, 1968), 12-24; this responds in part to Emil Fackenheim's critical view of God in Search of Man in Conservative Judaism (Fall, 1960), pp. 50-53. "7 Music, poetry, religion - they all initiate in the soul [an] encounter with an aspect of reality for which reason has no concepts and language has no names" (Not Alone, p. 36). ' Through ignorance of how poetic language works, Heschel has been inaccurately ac- cused of anthropomorphism: "The boldness of Dr. Heschel's thought consists, first, in tak- ing literally all biblical expressions that ascribe to God emotions of love and hatred," [etc.]</page><page sequence="6">ABRAHAM J. HESCHEL'S PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION 99 tive. Heschel's more literary sensitiv- ity to these holy words is rather an af- firmation of biblical poetry as a mode of expression which links human awareness to the divine, for poetry can convey a reality which does not neces- sarily conform to habitual expectations. Heschel in fact offers us an ap- proach to literature which leads to a precise analysis of religious discourse. Poetry first presents an original frame of reference, within the very context of the poem: "When a great poet ap- pears, he does not offer proof of his being a poet. His poetry speaks for itself, creating in us the power to ap- preciate its novel and exceptional vi- sion of life at the price of abandoning established conceptions" (In Search, p. 240). Heschel's view of "true poe- try" and art is that they awaken in the participant a fresh sensitivity. Poetry and art communicate through inspira- tion; they evoke profound, trans-sub- jective responses: "We do not turn to art in order to gratify, but in order to foster interests and feelings. A work of art introduces us to emotions which we have never cherished before. . . . Great works produce rather than sat- isfy needs by giving the world fresh craving" (Not Alone, p. 218). There is thus a truth of poetry (not only a "poetic truth," i.e., a validity confined to the context of the poem). Artistic vision is a form of knowledge and in- sight, an imaginative actualization of, and an anticipated commitment to, an actual transformation of life. Receptiveness to the power of words involves above all respect for their autonomy. Heschel describes his attitude toward words using an analogy with moral sensitivity, suggesting that linguistic judgment is connected with human delicacy: To say that words are nothing but mental beasts of burden [i.e., denotative signs] would be the same as to see in the person who carries our luggage to the train nothing but a porter. The essence of a person is not in carrying luggage, and the essence of the word is not in its being a sign. Let us distinguish between substance and func- tion, between the essential nature of a word and its function, the mode in which it is used by us (Man's Quest, p. 26). The word has an independent dignity and power. It is our responsibility to actualize, through our insight, its in- trinsic depth. Poetry is especially rich because its words are polysemantic, ex- pressing simultaneously several levels of meaning and value. Heschel describes the difference between a literal, one-dimensional ap- prehension of words and a poetic ap- preciation of their suggestibility by distinguishing descriptive from indica- (Eliezer Berkovits, "Dr. A. J. Heschel's Theology of Pathos," Tradition: A Journal of Ortho- dox Thought, 6, No. 2 [Spring-Summer, 19641, 70). Firmly grounded on this misunder- standing of Heschel's language, Berkovits refutes its validity: "No matter how much we might magnify or purify [our concepts] in trying to apply them to God, we either associate some positive meaning with them, in which case we shall be describing something finite that will have no relevance to God, or else we shall be using words without any meaningful positive contents" (p. 72; also p. 73). By using the phrase "meaningful positive contents" Berkovits reduces all linguistic validity to its purely denotative, empirically referential func- tion.

V, "Traits of Expressive Language," and IX, "Expressive Statement and Truth," and the remainder of the present paper.</page><page sequence="7">100 EDWARD K. KAPLAN tive words. As always, his linguistic concepts imply a manner of experi- encing reality: Descriptive words . . .stand in a fixed re- lation to conventional and definite mean- ings, such as the concrete nouns, chair, table, or the terms of science; and indicative words . . . stand in a fluid relation to in- effable meanings and, instead of describing, merely intimate something which we can intuit but cannot fully comprehend. The content of words such as God, time, beauty, eternity cannot be faithfully imagined or re- produced in our minds. Still they convey a wealth of meaning to our sense of the ineffable. . . . [Indicative words] call forth ... not so much a memory, but a response, ideas unheard of, meanings not fully real- ized before (In Search, pp. 181-182). Like descriptive, denotative words, in- dicative words have "content" and "meaning." Though the level of ap- prehension is different, they are no less real within their own context of ex- perience. The reader is primarily re- sponsible for the relevance of the con- tent of indicative words. With lan- guage whose signification requires a deep and sincere response, "the real burden of understanding is upon the mind and soul of the reader" (loc. cit.). For example, the problem as to the meaning of the (metaphorical) assertion "God's word came to me" is thus an open one, dependent upon the intelligence, spiritual sensitivity and flexibility of the person to whom it is addressed. All true religious statement must reveal the relativity of language: "It is only in similes that we can com- municate when speaking of the ulti- mate" (Not Alone, p. 64). Prayer is, for Heschel, the finest experience of the power of religious language. Prayer as an act of empathy actualizes the full depth of indicative words. An empathic response to writ- ten prayers can awaken within us a sense of the concrete experience to which the text alludes: "It is through our reading and feeling the words of the prayers, through the imaginative projection of our consciousness into the meaning of the words, and through empathy for the ideas with which the words are pregnant, that this type of prayer comes to pass" (Man's Quest, p. 28). Empathy underlies all poetic reading, actualizing both the semantic richness of the word and the inner life of the reader: What we encounter is the word itself, its unique intensity, the complex of meanings which surround it and which exist far be- yond its dictionary meaning, of its strict re- lation to the object of which it is a sign. A word is a focus, a point at which mean- ings meet and from which meanings seem to proceed. In prayer, as in poetry, we turn to the words, not to use them as signs for things, but to see things in the light of the words (ibid., p. 26). Reading a poetic word in its depth and creative potential can become an onto- logically valid experience: it can trans- form the reader's vision of the world. The ultimate achievement of read- ing religious words with full inner participation is a mutuality between man and text: "It is the spiritual pow- er of the praying man that makes mani- fest what is dormant in the text. The character of the act of prayer depends on the reciprocal relation between the person and the word" (ibid., p. 27). The function of religious conviction, which underlies Heschel's own exper- ience of traditional language, is to re- vitalize an immanent force: "Words</page><page sequence="8">ABRAHAM J. HESCHEL'S PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION 101 of prayer are repositories of the spirit" (ibid., p. 25). The aspirations of those less comfortable in faith should also function in dialogue with liturgical words. Poetry is a bridge between yearning and belief. THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE FAITHLESS The problem of the faithless is this: "When placed before the Bible, the words of which are like dwellings made of rock, we do not know how to find the door" (In Search, p. 244). A theory of poetry is perhaps a guide to that door, and true poetic experience its key. For those of us unable to ac- cept Heschel's faith as an object of certainty, a penetration of what ex- periences are available to us through the linguistic and intellectual sympathy of poetry may bring us closer to those who live in genuine piety. The more poetic and expressive aspects of Hes- chel's style are meant to nurture these intimate responses;9 and his theory is meant to train our minds to open. Investigation of the poetic dimen- sion of religious statements is a funda- mental way to fathom our search for faith; or as Heschel puts it: "How does one rise from saying the word 'God' to sensing His realness?" (Prophets, p. 274). One must first realize that "as- sertions that intend to convey the es- sence of reality or the aspect of mys- tery and grandeur are always under- statements" (In Search, p. 122). The words used to describe God, by their very inadequacy, evoke a sense of trans- cendence in relation to man: "when taken to be allusions rather than des- criptions, understatements rather than accurate accounts, they are aids in evok- ing our sense of His realness" (Pro- phets, p. 277). This "language of pre- sence" which uses the techniques of poetry can evoke simultaneously a reality transcending human thought and an image of grandeur in the form of a figure of speech. In the last analy- sis, the manner of apprehending reli- gious language determines its efficacy.10 The key to understanding the phe- nomenological aspect of religious lan- guage is its simultaneity of impres- sions: the manner in which the poly- valent words convey to the conscious- ness of the reader a sense of man's limits and the power of his poetry. In prayer one realizes most acutely the outer limits of poetic language: In no other act does man experience so of- ten the disparity between the desire for expression and the means of expression as "I have discussed more directly these ideas in "Toward a Poetics of Faith," Response (Spring, 1971), pp. 44-46, and in its sequel, "'Three Dimensions of Human Fullness: Poetry, Love, and Prayer," Judaism: A Quarterly Journal (forthcoming); see also "Form and Content in Abraham J. Heschel's Poetic Style," Central Conference of American Rabbis Journal (April, 1971), pp. 28-39. LO "Not the words we utter, the service of the lips, but the very way in which the devo- tion of the heart corresponds to what the words contain, the consciousness of speaking under His eyes, is the pith of prayer" (Man's Quest, p. 13). According to a poetic reading of this statement, the expression "under His eyes" is not a literal, anthropomorphic description of God, but a mere hint, in figurative language, used to describe or evoke the ineffable experi- ence of being an object of God's awareness. Cf. ibid., p. 84 for a definition of kavanah, and below note 22.</page><page sequence="9">102 EDWARD K. KAPLAN in prayer . . . . What the word can no longer yield, man achieves through the full- ness of his powerlessness. The deeper the need in which one is placed through this powerlessness, the more does man reveal himself in his essence, and himself becomes expression. Prayer is more than communi- cation and man more than the word (Man's Quest, pp. 39-40). Heschel's term "the fullness of [man's] powerlessness" expresses, in the con- cise, paradoxical form of poetic dis- course, an intuition, through language itself, of man's relation to God. On the one hand, man's language is powerless to communicate with the transcendent God; the very feebleness of his "means of expression" convey to him God's un- utterable grandeur. On the other hand - and herein lies the spiritual hope that language bestows upon the seeker - by this awareness of absolute dis- parity, he achieves a "fullness," a deeper need to approach God. The seeker is full for he awakens within himself a sense of God's remote presence. When man reveals his "essence" in true prayer, "and himself becomes ex- pression," he has actualized in his inner life the spiritual insight that was dormant in the text. Language perceived in this manner is, thus, a direct experience of the in- effable, an ontologically valid intuition of the human and divine dimensions of man's existence. And, according to Heschel, this prayerful insight, by the intensity of its realization, is an actual participation in God's immanence: "It is the ineffable in us which reaches God rather than the expressed feeling. The unutterable surplus of what we feel, the sentiments that we are unable to put into words are our payment in kind to God" (ibid., p. 40). The ineffable, a human intellectual category erected in response to God's absolute grandeur, is a metaphor used to evoke that presence. The language of prayer provokes (or awakens) within us an ineffable longing to seek God. In ex- periencing the powerlessness of langu- age, man achieves the plenitude of sen- sing the Beyond of all human possibil- ity. THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF BIBLICAL METAPHOR A fundamental confrontation of searching doubt and faith takes place on the field of tradition, where the discrepancy between creed and belief may be the broadest. Heschel takes the Bible in particular as a foundation of religious truth, so that his primary task is "to recall and to keep alive the meta-symbolic relevance" of its langu- age: "We cannot sense [God's] pre- sence in the Bible except by being responsive to it. Only living with its words, only sympathy with its pathos, will open our ear to its voice. Biblical words are like musical signs of a divine harmony which only the finest chords of the soul can utter" (In Search, p. 252). Heschel's metaphor of "musical signs of a divine harmony" expresses the inner assent which man must give to religious language, while emphasiz- ing an intuitive, non-verbal mode of perception. It also suggests a definite structure of religious language as a linguistic sign with a transcendent, or divine, referent. Heschel's analysis of the metaphorical nature of biblical language is another way in which he challenges us to surpass words to per- ceive God's reality. Heschel's basic conviction is that</page><page sequence="10">ABRAHAM J. HESCHEL'S PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION 103 "the Bible is holiness in words;" "it is as if God took these Hebrew words and breathed into them of His power, and the words become a live wire charged with His spirit. To this very day they are hyphens between heaven and earth" (loc. cit.). To Heschel the biblical word is a living link between two distinct dimensions of reality. The religious word as "hyphen" between human and divine implies a structural connection between the two. A sense for the presence of God is the realiza- tion of that contact. The theological or apologetic purpose of Heschel's treatment of language is accordingly to educate his reader's receptivity so that he might benefit from the spiritual treasures immanent to religious texts: "Our problem, then, is how to share the certainty of Israel that the Bible contains that which God wants us to know and hearken to; how to attain a collective sense for the presence of God in the biblical words" (ibid., p. 246).11 The prophets best exemplify for Heschel the way in which biblical language is to be construed, for they are the authors - with God - of the Bible's most compelling statements. Prophets are poets who have attempted to convey a direct experience of the ineffable: "The prophets bear witness to an event. The event is divine, but the formulation is done by the indivi- dual prophet. According to this con- ception, the idea is revealed; the ex- pression is coined by the prophet" (ibid., p. 265). The words of Scrip- ture are thus not "coextensive and identical with the words of God."12 "Yet who shall presume to be an ex- pert in discerning what is divine and what is but 'little lower' than divine? ... The spirit of God is set in the language of man, and who shall judge what is content and what is frame?" (ibid., pp. 258-259). Given the neces- sarily inexpressible nature of the div- ine, it would be absurd - indeed blasphemous from the theological standpoint - to identify the "con- tent" of the biblical word (i.e., God's essential nature) with its human rendi- tion, the biblical figure of speech. To pass from a theological to a structural level of analysis, we now examine the two poles of biblical discourse, its hu- man and divine contexts of validity. A structural description of biblical poetry, in which the metaphor is con- sidered in relation to both man and God, should clarify the validity of such language.13 The metaphor is a con- crete image which alludes to another reality, based on some analogy between the two terms. The "vehicle" of the SThe sentence which follows underlines the gravity of Heschel's theological endeavor: "In this problem lies the dilemma of our fate, and in the answer lies the dawn or the doom" (In Search, p. 246); cf. ibid., pp. 252-253. " Heschel uses biblical thought to support the difference between human and divine "speech:" "Surely man would flash into blaze, if he were exposed to the word in itself. Therefore, the word became clothed before it entered the world of creation" (ibid., p. 265); also, ibid., p. 181; and Ch. 27, "The Principle of Revelation" (pp. 257-278) for the theo- logical implications of this discussion - beyond the scope of the present study.

For example, metaphor may be used to express something less known, abstract or even unknown by something more familiar: e.g., "A mighty fortress is our God." A fortress as image alludes to one particular as- pect of God, seen from a definitely hu- man perspective. The common quality which permits the metaphorical equa- tion or comparison is the "ground" of the metaphor, here God's strength and stability. In Heschel's words the "ground" of the biblical metaphor is the "hyphen between heaven and earth," since it provides man with an intima- tion of the ultimately real. Notice also that the vehicle and tenor themselves must remain incomplete representations of their referents, for they must isolate, in order to intensify, specific qualities. It is in this sense as well that Heschel characterizes religious discourse as understatement, for the vehicle of man's language can never completely express the divine tenor. Use of this linguistic terminology can clarify the non-anthropomorphic content of biblical metaphors. Heschel explains his principle of divine pathos, God's emotional concern for man, by analyzing the function of words:14 "The statements about [God's] pathos are not a compromise - ways of ac- commodating higher meanings to the lower level of human understanding. They are rather the accommodation of words to higher meanings. Words of psychological denotations are endowed with a theological connotation" (Pro- phets, p. 271). All descriptions of God are necessarily metaphorical, for the vehicle in religious discourse can never render the tenor accurately and posi- tively. The use of anthropomorphic expressions does not itself prove belief in anthropomorphic conceptions of God (loc. cit.). The "accommodation of words to higher meanings" involves an act of surpassing ordinary categories of thought and experience, if only because of the metaphorical nature of the lan- guage. Note that religious reality is not made to conform to human cate- gories; language is not considered theologically valid. Rather the imagi- native or evocative power of language itself is expanded in an attempt to reach the ultimate: "In the biblical ex- pressions of divine emotions . . . the religious consciousness experiences a sense of superhuman power rather than a conception of resemblance to man" (loc. cit.). The poetic component of this religious intuition of biblical lan- guage is the reader's awareness of its complex structure "which of necessity combines otherness and likeness, uniqueness and comparability, in speaking about God" (ibid., p. 270). Heschel builds his philosophy of re- ligion on the gulf which separates hu- man and divine, the vehicle and tenor of the biblical metaphor, and chal- lenges our minds to break out of their habitual categories beyond words. It must be stressed, however, that the poetic character of biblical language does not preclude authentic religious insight. On the contrary, understand- 14 Cf.

HESCHEL'S PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION 105 ing poetic structure should bring us closer to that experience. Reflecting the structure of language is Heschel's theological judgment of the Bible's descriptions of God's "emotions": "Pathos is a thought that bears a re- semblance to an aspect of divine reality as related to the world of man. As a theological category, it is a genuine in- sight into God's relatedness to man, rather than a projection of human traits into divinity, as found for ex- ample in the god images of mythology" (ibid., p. 271). The terms "resem- blance" and "relatedness" refer to the ground of the metaphor, the quality shared by two disparate realities. Knowing that a metaphor must choose only particular aspects of a reality in its analogy, a religious metaphor con- veys - paradoxically - its own inade- quacy with regard to God as such while, simultaneously, disclosing an aspect of God which man can compre- hend. Structurally speaking, man re- lates to God as does the vehicle of a metaphor to its tenor: both can express only part of a reality from which they are, in essence, different. All religious affirmation is metonymy. Heschel also dissociates the limited validity of human expression from ul- timate reality in his comparison of poetic and prophetic inspiration.'" After tracing a history of theories of poetic conception, Heschel describes the poet's apparently subjectless inspir- ation: "Structurally, the experience may be described as an object-object-rela- tionship. Out of such inspiration, mysterious and overwhelming as it may be, no poet can derive the power of prefacing his words with the state- ment: 'Thus says the Lord'" (ibid., p. 389). Subjective in its origin, "poetic inspiration, though of great importance for the understanding of the poet's consciousness and the secret of creativ- ity, is of no intrinsic significance for the evaluation of the [artistic] work itself" (loc. cit.). The poem, while it may transform our vision of reality, does not make an ontological state- ment other than that of imagination as origin of a work of art. "In prophetic inspiration, on the other hand, the knowledge and pres- ence of Him who imparts the message is the central, staggering fact of aware- ness. There is a certainty of having experienced the impingement of a personal Being, of another I.... Struc- turally, it may be described as a subject- subject-relationship" (loc. cit.). The significance of such inspiration is thus displaced from the subjective, as in poetic creation, to the objectively trans- cendent made immanent by God's ad- dress to man: Prophetic inspiration is really revelation. The tenor, not the vehicle, of prophetic poetry is its ulti- mate value. For the prophetic con- sciousness, imagination and communi- cation must be pointers to the reality of God. The divine component of the bib- lical metaphor is its only metaphysi- cally "true" content. Heschel takes the phrase "God spoke" and examines its validity in this light: e"what is literally true to us is a metaphor compared with what is metaphysically real to God" (In Search, p. 180). This is another way of asserting the religious truth of 1 Cf. Prophets, Ch. 22, "Prophecy and Prophetic Inspiration," pp. 367-389.</page><page sequence="13">106 EDWARD K. KAPLAN the tenor while affirming the contin- gent nature of the vehicle of biblical metaphors. In religious texts, language that refers to God is but a crude allu- sion to sacred reality: "The speech of God is not less but more than literally real" (loc. cit.). By characterizing re- ligious assertions as understatements, Heschel emphasizes the beyond of words in displacing his usual emphasis from the negativity of language to its God-side. Aware of the abyss that separates our thought from God, we still attempt to conceive categories which surpass our imagination: "in mo- ments of insight the ineffable is a metaphor in a forgotten mother tongue" (Not Alone, p. 75). The ineffable is a category of human experience, here considered as an outward form of God, a metaphor of divine reality from man's perspective. The "forgotten mother tongue" is perhaps man's awareness of having been created in God's image, the Edenic rapport with the Creator. Understanding the struc- ture of the biblical metaphor is a first step in learning the structure of reality itself, so that our world of words can finally give way to an apprehension of the transcendent. The positive aspect of the ineffable, then, is its semantic function as a sort of negative attribute of God. Mystery "is not a synonym for the unknown but rather a name for a meaning which stands in relation to God" (In Search, p. 74). Displacing the validity of the term from the human to the divine, Heschel shows structurally how a nega- tive human category can express posi- tive divine meaning. Semantically negative, the religious term "ineffable" affirms through its evocative, indicative poetic power. Heschel makes his own structural description of the manner in which man relates to God. This is illustrated by the nature of biblical poetry which, like the moral life of the pious man, is tri-dimensional: "Every act can be evaluated by two coordinate axes, the abscissa is man, the ordinate is God. To those who are attentive to Him who is beyond the ineffable, God's relation to the world is an actuality" (Not Alone, p. 225). In other words, man communicates to man on the hori- zontal axis (the abscissa) while God functions vertically (the ordinate), in- tersecting human awareness at points of insight: "The self, the fellow man and the dimension of the holy are the three dimensions of mature human concern" (ibid., p. 139). To continue Heschel's schema, literal language is horizontal, pointing to a concrete ob- ject in the phenomenal world. The presence of a sacred intuition in a word takes our consciousness to the vertical axis where the material meets the spiritual, the visible the invisible. The biblical metaphor is such a "meet- ing place" (Man's Quest, p. 139). Heschel's explication of the repre- sentation of the Sabbath as a Queen or a Bride, for example, illustrates his interpretation of biblical metaphor. He utterly rejects a literal reading of this figure: "[it] did not represent a mental image, something that could be imagined" (Sabbath, p. 59).16 The 18 Cf. also ibid., pp. 273-274 for the "idea of God's betrothal to Israel;" ibid., p. 276 for "The Lord is my shepherd;" In Search, p. 9 "our Father in Heaven;" and Insecurity of Free- dom, p. 120, for an analysis of the imagery of Psalm 19.</page><page sequence="14">ABRAHAM J. HESCHEL'S PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION 107 vertical dimension of language, the axis of connotation and indication, is the one actualized in this image: "The idea of the Sabbath as a queen or a bride is not a personification of the Sabbath but an exemplification of a divine attribute, an illustration of God's need for human love; it does not re- present a substance but the presence of God, His relationship to man" (ibid., p. 60). Using our structual description of the biblical metaphor, the Sabbath "bride" is a vehicle which "exemplifies," "illustrates" one parti- cular aspect of God, the tenor; not God's substance in itself, only that which harmonizes with human intui- tion. The ground of the metaphor, the quality (or value) shared by the two terms, is man's intimation of the holy: "Such metaphorical exemplification does not state a fact; it expresses a value, putting into words the precious- ness of the Sabbath as Sabbath" (loc. cit.). Awareness of the metaphysical independence of the tenor and vehicle in this image corresponds to a percep- tion of God's transcendence. Perceiv- ing the ground of the biblical metaphor is a way of actualizing God's presence in the world by giving an example of His intrinsic relatedness."1 Biblical poetry is one path to God. SYMBOLIC AND RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE Although poetic experience can go far in unlocking the spiritual in- sights contained in sacred words, Heschel militantly rejects an exclusive dependence upon symbols in ritual and moral acts. The mystical element in Heschel's approach to religion is impli- cit in the evocative power of his lan- guage, the often incandescent tones with which he sings his own piety and profound faith, and his poetics of sacred language.18 But he does not promote a mystical quest in the usual sense, that of the individual seeking union with God. He proposes, rather, a new way of thinking, the goal of which is to view life from God's perspective through sympathy with God's concern for man: "The mystic experience is man's turning toward God; the pro- phetic act is God's turning toward man .... From the mystic experience we may gain an insight of man into the life of God; from the prophetic act we learn of an insight of God into the life of man"(In Search, p. 198). Ultimately poetic empathy with sacred texts should be tested by pro- phetic commitment; man's quest for God should sharpen his response to mankind. The mystical and the pro- 17 "Great is the power of prayer. For to worship is to expand the presence of God in the world. God is transcendent, but our worship makes Him immanent. This is implied in the idea that God is in need of man: His being immanent depends upon us.* *A. J. Heschel, Man Is Not Alone, Ch. 23" (Man's Quest, p. 62). This is the theological assump- tion we examine in light of linguistic data. " For Heschel's most explicit analysis of mysticism see "The Mystical Element in Juda- ism," in The Jews: Their History, Culture, and Religion, ed. by Louis Finkelstein (New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, and Philadelphia: The Jewish Publication Society of America, 1949), pp. 602-623 [in Vol. I of the 2-volume edition, and in Vol. II of the 4-volume edi- tion]; also The Earth is the Lord's (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1962), Chapts. 10, "Kabbalah," and 11, "Hasidism," pp. 69-82.</page><page sequence="15">108 EDWARD K. KAPLAN phetic represent a polarity fundamental to Heschel's thought, a polarity in which all three dimensions of human life together are actualized: concern for the self, the fellow-man - both grounded upon a sense of the holy. Understanding the symbolic na- ture of both verbal language and ritual acts is the precondition of a truly re- ligious approach to life. Heschel de- mands that we always keep our sights on God's reality so that religion may not become idolatry: "The essential function of the critic is to protect such ideas [i.e., dogma] from pretension and inflation, resulting in either visible or verbal iconography. A sacred venture is always in danger of ending in blas- phemy" (Prophets, pp. 273-274). He hopes that the insight of "the creative mind" will balance the critic's knowl- edge of the different levels of exper- ience with actual religious acts: "To the pious man knowledge of God is not a thought within his grasp, but a form of thinking in which he tries to com- prehend all reality" (Not Alone, p. 108). The form, not the content of thought, the manner in which one tries to comprehend (embrace or conceive) reality, describes true religious under- standing. The most fundamental distinction which Heschel makes in symbolism is the one between the real symbol which represents the divine, for instance, "be- cause it is assumed that the Divine re- sides in it or that the symbol partakes to some degree of the reality of the Divine;" and the conventional symbol which "represents to the mind an entity that is not shown, not because its sub- stance is endowed with something of that entity but because it suggests that entity, by reason of relationship, assoc- iation or convention, e.g., a flag" (Man's Quest, p. 118). The "conven- tional symbol" is another name for the metaphor discussed above with a main- ly syntactical relation between vehicle and tenor. Judaism has always abomi- nated the "real symbol" in ritual ob- servance; and it is to protect us from mistaking the object for the ineffa- ble, the metaphor for divine reality, that Heschel clarifies the relation of form to content in ritual acts. For even a poetic interpretation of religious language, if used as an end in itself, can subvert the entire religious venture: "The quest for sym- bols is a trap for those who seek the truth. Symbols may either distort what is literally true or profane what is ineffably real. They may, if employed in the inner chamber of the heart, distort our longing for God into mere esthetics" (ibid., p. 142). We have seen how the symbol may disfigure religious truth if the metaphoric ve- hicle is construed as a literal, adequate representation of its divine tenor. The deeper presymbolic quest for God may also be fooled by its own esthetic gratification. Heschel consequently separates esthetic from religious truth: "This is one of the aspects which distinguishes the religious from the esthetic experi- ence: In a religious experience. it is not a thing that imposes itself on man but a spiritual presence" (Sabbath, note p. 119, p. 6). To consider an esthetic intuition as an intimation of divinity is to miss God's actual pre- sence: "An esthetic experience leaves</page><page sequence="16">ABRAHAM J. HESCHEL'S PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION 109 behind the memory of a perception and enjoyment; a prophetic experience leaves behind the memory of a commit- ment" (In Search, p. 213).19 There are behavioral citeria which suggest the authenticity of a religious encounter. The moral life of one who meets God is usually transformed: his private in- ner experience calls him to outward action. The danger of the esthetic fal- lacy, as in all symbolism for Heschel, is to equate expression with reality. Heschel's use of language as a vehicle for religious intuition eventually dis- solves to affirm directly God's reality, and stress the necessity of exercising personal insight in the world. THE REALISM OF SACRED METAPHOR: RITUAL AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY The dilemma of modern religious life to which Heschel principally ad- dresses himself is the crisis of belief as it is reflected in the linguistic con- cepts of some religious leaders, those who construe language in a purely denotative manner. Insofar as his philosophy of religion represents an apologia for traditional Judaism, Heschel's empathic, or poetic, inter- pretation of ritual acts is meant to re- new experience of the holy within pre- scribed symbols. In my analysis, I have assumed that it is not necessary to assent to his specific theological assumptions in order to see how they might work for the seeker as well as the believer. In this perspective of in- terested distance, Heschel's interpreta- tion of Jewish law has the general aim of elucidating the relation of social forms of religion to their divine foundation, the distinction between man's search for and his response to God. Our tension with his firm faith should render our religious quest more vital and authentic, as we seek personal confirmation of the real pole of sacred metaphor. Our ultimate goal should be, insists Heschel, to go beyond symbols to di- vine reality itself. And prayer is the touchstone of the spiritual authenticity of contemporary religion: "We have lost the power to pray because we have lost the sense of His reality. All we do is done for the sake of something else" (Man's Quest, p. xiii).20 Heschel strictly limits the human validity of symbols, we have seen, to emphasize what is beyond thought: "[The Bible] is built upon a rock of certainty that God has made known His will to His "Cf. also Man's Quest, p. 143. Much work on the phenomenological and ontological differences between esthetic and religious experience remains to be done. A significant contribution to this task in Thomist thought is Marcel de Corte, "Ontologie de la Poesie" (in French), Revue Thomiste, XLIII, No. 3 (Nov.-Dec. 1937), 361-392, and ibid., XLIV, No. 1 (Jan. 1938), 99-125.

KAPLAN people. To us, the will of God is nei- ther a metaphor nor a euphemism but more powerful and more real than our own experience" (ibid., p. 131). The power and authenticity of Heschel's own expression rest upon this "rock of certainty," this "ontological presup- position." Heschel's indisputable con- fidence, unfortunately, can also func- tion as a stumbling-block to those who cannot share his faith. His own poetry is meant to harmonize the intimate yearnings of all men with specific re- ligious ideals which would otherwise remain abstract and empty. His dis- cussion of religious symbolism and observance can suggest to all what genuine piety might be. The category of action which for Heschel unites man with God's will is the mitzvah, a commandment from God and a deed or religious act as man's response. Ideally the mitzvah should be a direct answer to God, not passive obedience to an outward form of human authority, in what Heschel calls "religious behaviorism." "The primary function of symbols [or sym- bolic language about religion] is to express what we think; the primary function of the mitzvoth is to express what God wills. Religious symbolism is a search for God, Jewish observance, a response to God" (ibid., p. 136). The mitzvah represents in the domain of external behavior what the biblical metaphor represents to man's inner consciousness. Both can be appre- hended as a vehicle having a meaning in and by itself, or both can be experi- enced as pointer, indicating a living presence which ultimately transcends man. Thus, in the field of religious ethics we can also differentiate between the form and the content of the act. Heschel states first that "there is no inherent sanctity in Jewish ritual objects .... [They have] no symbolic content" (ibid., p. 122). "Ceremonies are created for the purpose of signify- ing: mitzvoth were given for the pur- pose of sanctifying" (ibid., p. 114). Ritual objects and ceremonies are vehicles of metaphors which convey, remind us of the inner life of genuine piety: "The purpose of ritual art ob- jects in Judaism is not to inspire love of God but to enhance our love of do- ing a mitzvah (religious act)" (ibid., p. 123). Interaction with an external object does not itself constitute a re- sponse to God - the aim of true observance: "Symbols have a psycholo- gical, not an ontological, status; they do not affect any reality, except the psyche of man. Mitzvoth affect God. Symbols evade, mitzvoth transcend, reality. Symbols are less, mitzvoth more than real .... Whatever is done in religious observance is an original act" (ibid., p. 136). Like the meta- phoric language used by the prophets when speaking of God, an external religious act is a mere allusion to ex- periences which cannot be communi- cated through verbal formulation: a full response to God joins inner intui- tion with outward conduct. Heschel's emphasis on the inner in- tention in man's ritual acts reminds us that religious meaning is derived from ineffable situations: "Kavanah is aware- ness of the will of God rather than awareness of the reason of the mitzvah. Awareness of symbolic meaning is awareness of a specific idea; kavanah</page><page sequence="18">ABRAHAM J. HESCHEL'S PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION 111 is awareness of an ineffable situation" (Man's Quest, p. 137). Consciousness is the criterion by which Hechel judges the validity of religious experience; it is an inward standard of reference. In structural terms, the vehicle (action), by alluding to its tenor (God), evokes a feeling of the presence of the holy (the ground of the metaphor). "A mitzvah is performed when a deed is outdone by a sigh, when Divine re- ference is given to a human fact. In a mitzvah we give the source of an act, rather than the underlining of a word" (ibid., p. 135). The sigh is Heschel's poetic way of evoking a sense of the divine dimension to which the act refers, its "source." Religious observance functions, like poetic dis- course in the Bible, by enriching our responses to life, and daring our minds to surpass appearances in an uncom- promising quest for truth. Perhaps the most challenging and, to my mind, the boldest of Heschel's concepts of language is his literal in- terpretation of man as an image of God: The symbol of God is man, every man. God created man in His image (tselem), in His likeness (demuth). How signifi- cant is the fact that the term tselem which is frequently used in a damnatory sense for a man-made image of God, as well as the term demuth, of which Isaiah claims (40:18) no demuth or likeness can be ap- plied to God - are employed in denoting man as an image and likeness of God (ibid., p. 124). These words are denotative; they are not merely pointers to an ineffable concept of "image." For Heschel, man is the vehicle of a "real symbol," par- taking of God's substance as well as His function: "Biblical tradition insists that not only man's soul but also his body is symbolic of God" (loc. cit.). How are we to reconcile Heschel's re- fusal of the literal adequacy of biblical language with this apparent deification of man? Again we must remember the mode in which Heschel interprets such statements. Religious concepts repre- sent an "accommodation of words to higher meanings," not an inflation of human thought to the level of abso- lute reality. Religious affirmations are understatements whose transcendent object is God, not hyperboles based on the final reality of man. Hence, to consider man as an image of God is an assertion reflecting God's view of man, not man's picture of himself. The structure which most characterizes Heschel's religious thought is his dis- placement of subjectivity from man to God. The Bible, for instance, is "God's anthropology of man." This reversal of the usual manner of thinking, and of construing religious language, itself illustrates man's attempt to imitate God, the realization of his essence as imago Dei. Heschel's fundamental message is both moral and metaphysical, devoted to the improvement of the physical and spiritual dimensions of human exis- tence. By clarifying the relative valid- ity of the two poles of metaphorical analogy-the common ground between man as vehicle and God as tenor Heschel affirms the relation of God to man, the interaction of divine trans- cendence and immanence. For man, "what is necessary is not to have a symbol but to be a symbol. In this</page><page sequence="19">112 EDWARD K. KAPLAN spirit, all objects and all actions are not symbols in themselves [i.e., real symbols] but ways and means of en- hancing the living symbolism of man" (Man's Quest, p. 126).21 Man's "liv- ing symbolism" is a social actualization of the function of the real symbol in the world of objects. Only man, in Jewish tradition, shares that quality with God. A still more basic distinction must be made in Heschel's theology of man as symbol. For, as even the structure of the real symbol shows, never is the vehicle identical and coextensive with the tenor: "The divine symbolism of man is not in what he has - such as reason or the power of speech--but in what he is potentially: he is able to be holy as God is holy. To imitate God, to act as He acts in mercy and love, is the way of enhancing our likeness. Man becomes what he worships" (ibid., pp. 126-127). Man's divine es- sence, the quality he shares with God, is a potential, not a full actuality; man functions in a manner parallel to God, though not on the same plane. For Heschel, worship is a human reflection of divine action: "We worship Him not by employing figures of speech but by the actual shaping of our lives ac- cording to His pattern" (ibid., p. 132). Interpretation of biblical poetry finally leads one to a literal understanding of the responsibility of being human un- der the eyes of God.22 A SPIRITUAL ODYSSEY Heschel thus presents his interpre- tation of the structure of biblical poet- ry, and in general his concepts of language, in order to (1) make us aware of the disparity between human expression and God's reality - hum- bling man, and (2) to specify the na- ture of man's divine essence so that he will imitate God, rather than wor- ship his own portrait of divinity. Heschel's uncompromising attac k against religious symbolism is, at one level of his exposition, a warning not to reduce religion to esthetics: "The soul of the religious man lives in the depth of certainty: This is what God wants me to do. Where that certainty is dead, the most powerful symbolism will be futile" (ibid., p. 142). Our analysis of Heschel's various concepts of language was meant to suggest that one without faith could also compre- hend and benefit from his insights. Heschel's firm condemnation of symbolism as a means of authentic re- ligious experience is meant to displace our judgments from man to God. He overstates his case in order to jolt the complacency of those who are unwill- ing to reach beyond symbols toward dynamic faith: Those who are in the dark in their lonely search for God; those to whom God is a problem, or a Being that is eternally absent or silent; those who ask, "How does one know Him? Where can one find Him? How "See also "Sacred Image of Man," in A. J. Heschel, The Insecurity of Freedom: Essays on Human Existence, pp. 150-167. "*This is the moral form of the displacement of subjectivity developed throughout Heschel's theology. For example, "the purpose of prayer is to be brought to His attention, to be listened to, to be understood by Him" (Man's Quest, p. 10); cf. also ibid., p. 61. "In faith [we seek] to rise above our own wisdom, to think of the world in terms of God, to live in accord with what is relevant to God" (In Search, p. 118).</page><page sequence="20">ABRAHAM J.

The context of this passage shows that the polemical strength of this assertion is meant to affirm Heschel's own cer- tainty of God's reality, and the fact that one should never be satisfied in the religious quest until an awareness of God is attained. Heschel's absolute rejection of symbolism as an insidious deceiver is simply a warning to the weary traveler. His own testimony provides many clues to "those who are in the dark in their lonely search for God." Heschel's analysis of the structure of language, its limits and powers has done much to show the non-believer that his quest must not necessarily stop with symbols, that symbolic know- ledge is illusion compared with a di- rect apprehension of God's presence. His exposition of the categories of re- ligious thinking and experience has clarified man's place in the divine plan, and his celebration of his own faith in parable, poetry and moral commit- ment23 gives us a model of piety and human richness. Whether or not one truly understands what it means for man to be created in God's image, Heschel's program for humanity is a challenge of immeasurable beauty and hope. ' See esp. The Insecurity of Freedom, and "The Moral Outrage of Vietnam," in Viet- nam: Crisis of Conscience, with Robert McAfee Brown and Michael Novak (New York: Association Press, Behrman House, etc., 1967). These writings which are direct responses to social ills and political disasters show how Heschel's spiritual perspective and theological vocabulary are applied to our everyday moral responsibility - the fulfillment of his inter- pretation of prophetic Judaism.</page></plain_text>
