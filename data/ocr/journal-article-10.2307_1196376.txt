<plain_text><page sequence="1">RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE AND SOCIAL PROGRESS LLOYD V. MOORE THE theological pendulum is swinging back to the supernatural extreme of its arc. In the recent past lib- eral religion and its extreme form, humanism, were popular. More recently under the influence of social reaction against all forms of liberalism, first in Europe and closely fol- lowing in America, liberal religion and humanism have become the targets of a concerted attack. The return to supernatural theism is well under way. Can the religionist take courage and give thanks unto God because accelerated social forces have turned the trend back toward supernaturalism? Does this re- verse swing mark a return to a more wholesome theology-as one might be led to suspect from its wide acclaim by many writ- ers-or does it mark a return to an escape mechanism and a perversion of religion at its best? Liberal religion with its emphasis upon social interests was the product of the application of the scientific method to the human area, especially to history, history of religions, including the Bible, and to social psychology. Other sciences made their con- tribution. Under the application of this method the social na- ture of religion was discovered. The anthropologist discovered this fact in primitive religion, and the historian discovered that institutions, mental and social, and the concepts of the super- natural were also socially originated and socially developed. The extreme humanistic reaction against the supernatural theism of the Hebrew-Christian tradition was due partly to the enthusiasm natural to any newly developed field of scientific endeavor and partly to the persistent popular retention of this supernaturalism in the face of the new knowledge of the nature of religion. 444</page><page sequence="2">RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE AND SOCIAL PROGRESS 445 Before this new social understanding of religion had won gen- eral acceptance outside of a relatively few educational centers and by a group of younger ministers and teachers of religion, the current reaction set in. This reaction was due to a number of factors. There was the inevitable return to a more sober view on the part of those who had taken the extreme humanist posi- tion. There was the drag exerted by those to whom the mem- ory of the easy comforts of the old supernaturalism still clung. The implications of the new concept of religion began to become apparent to those whose interests, economic and political, were affected. Of course they objected. All their interests, practical and religious, were called into question. It has always been thus in the creative periods of society when religion can do creative work. This reaction began in Europe and quickly came to America. Now the return to supernaturalism is widely herald- ed. Let us not be deceived by this trend. It does not mark a return to a "normal" type of religion in the form of super- natural theism. It has all the familiar historical earmarks of the story of religion in times of social turbulence. Religion in such times begins with creative social insight, and then under the impact of social opposition or of social despair takes its flight into the nebulous supernatural where it may rest in peace. This trend today, far from lending support to supernatural- ism, serves better to support the claims of the humanist that religion is entirely a social product, doing no creative work, but timidly following along in the trail of social trends. As such its values are the antithesis of those claimed for it by those who herald the return to supernaturalism. The creative periods of religion, when those religious experi- ences occurred which became the starting-point of the living religions of the world, were dealing primarily with social prob- lems and only secondarily with the idea of the supernatural. The turn to the supernatural as the central interest of the reli- gion occurred only when the original social problem was no long- er a live issue. In this process the real social occasion which</page><page sequence="3">446 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION gave birth to the religious experience was dropped from sight and the system was confined to the cultivation and the perpetu- ation of certain concepts of the supernatural, certain practices related to the supernatural, and to the attainment of certain personality traits. These interests were not the primary inter- ests of the creative religious experience, but came in as second- ary or later interests. Religious experiences may be classified after two types. One type occurs to individuals living entirely within the range of control of an accepted social system. The values involved have to do with the conventional life of the day. The result of the experience is to integrate more effectively the personality of the individual within the conventional culture. That process of integration not only is explained in terms of the prevailing metaphysical patterns; the experience itself is composed of ele- ments entirely within the accepted stream of belief and prac- tice. The constructive value of the experience lies in its effect upon the individual. A religious experience within the borders of a controlling social pattern may be greatly significant for the individual; its social effect will be to reinforce with all the fervor of religious conviction belief in the divine nature of the status quo. This is religion in its conserving function; it is not creative religion. The other type of religious experience is constructed out of the fragments of a broken social structure. Sometimes it is compounded of fragments from several social structures. Its significance is that the lives of those who follow in this new pat- tern of thinking and living have been lifted out of the old chan- nel, and their thinking and their living have become creative of new patterns. The religious experience is the process by which a new social fabric is created. Its effect upon the individual is secondary in value to its effect upon the social fabric. In both respects then-its effect upon the individual and its effect upon the social order-it differs from the other type. For the indi- vidual it is a new creative synthesis rather than an integration</page><page sequence="4">RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE AND SOCIAL PROGRESS 447 within an established order, and for the social order it becomes a new pattern for community life. Psychologically the two types are similar. In each there is an integration of experience, past and present. With respect to the metaphysics involved, either type may be, and traditionally has been, interpreted after all manner of metaphysical theory, de- pending upon whatever theory was currently available to the interpreter. The difference between the two types lies in the social significance and not in the psychological process or in the metaphysics. The religious experiences which conditioned the lives of the founders of the great religions of the world and gave birth to these religions were of the social type. In these experiences the central fact was not the experience of the supernatural but the solution of a social problem, with the "idea of the Holy" and its resultant interpretation as secondary factors. I shall take a few pages from the history of religions to illustrate this. The first example is that of Moses, the founder of Judaism. The story of his life and adventures is sufficiently well known not to need repetition in detail. The setting of the story is that of a Semitic tribe, with a tradition of nomadic life, in subjuga- tion to an agricultural people. A young man of the enslaved tribe, by a peculiar turn of fortune especially trained in adminis- tration, flees to the Arabian desert after failing in an attempted slave deliverance. He attaches himself to a nomadic tribe with similar antecedents and adopts the occupation known to his fathers, that of herdsman. He had abandoned a professional career with the government of the country which had enslaved his people-a career and an opportunity as comes to few men- in order to cast his lot with his own tribesmen. He is deeply concerned over their hard lot. This concern becomes an obses- sion with him. It is the dominant motive of his life. All his experiences and his ideas of religion turn about this obsession. The awe inspired by the volcanic phenomena of the region where he is herding sheep, and the sight of a small tree aflame,</page><page sequence="5">448 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION naturally a sacred object to a desert Semite, all gathered their meaning from this interest which dominated Moses' mind. The experience is interpreted in the only way he could interpret it -as an appearance of the local deity. Under the impact of this experience he succeeds in accomplishing his lifetime ambition. His enslaved people are led to freedom. Analysis of the narrative shows certain distinct items whose significance will be noted later. There is a social problem whose nature in this case is political-economic-military. There is an experience of insight into the solution of this problem by a per- son deeply interested, with its resultant effect upon the abilities of the person concerned. There is also a sense of the impor- tance of this insight which leads the person who has it to ascribe it to deity. The form of this ascription necessarily is in terms of the conventional concepts of the time and region. Gautama, founder of Buddhism, lived in a culture very differ- ent from that of the Semitic Moses. His environment was Ary- an, and his reactions and theories were Aryan. Otherwise, there is the common pattern of religious experience to be found in his story. As a prince of the royal house, young Gautama, pro- tected by the walls of royalty, evidently had not had close con- tact with the common life of the day. One day, riding out, he saw the life of the peasantry. He saw old age, death, and dis- ease. By contrast he saw the calm dignity of a hermit. Face to face with the perennial tragedy of all life, he sought the solution after the conventional religious custom of the day. He became a Hindu ascetic. Five or six years of this were enough to show him the futility of it. He is no nearer to a solution of the prob- len than before. He renounces this method, and in a day of meditation sees that the way out of the struggle with the mis- fortunes of life is to cease desiring that for which men struggle. His answer to the problems of life, sickness, old age, and death is the abolition of desire. Because of his typical Aryan concept of gods as subordinate to the spiritual absolute, he rejects their</page><page sequence="6">RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE AND SOCIAL PROGRESS 449 help and refuses to credit them with responsibility for his in- sight. He does believe he has found a universal religious solvent. There was no sharp clash between Gautama and the religious system of his day. The social implications of his vision did not become apparent at once. Hinduism let his movement grow as an obscure cult with scant opposition and with scant interest, quite in keeping with the eclectic character of Hinduism. It was only some two hundred years later, when Chandragupta, because of his low-caste antecedents, would rebel against the caste restraints of Hinduism, that the social nature of Buddhism became apparent. Under these circumstances the conflict be- tween the Buddhist doctrine of the abolition of desire as the way of salvation and the Hindu doctrine of caste became ap- parent. The social nature of Gautama's vision showed itself, that it offered a way of escape from the ills of life and to the blessings of Nirvana, apart from the caste system. Then it was that Buddhism became persona non grata in the land of its birth, and the religion of Gautama became the first great exam- ple of an expatriated religion. In its expatriation it lost its social reason for existence and it perpetuated only the secondary items, namely, the metaphysical theory and the personal reli- gious values. The elements it had absorbed from Hinduism, ex- ternal and comparatively irrelevant to Gautama's insight and purpose, became the central elements of the exiled religion. The problem of Mohammed's day was the conflict of two cul- tures. Those desert tribes were in a transition from the pastoral- agricultural stage of civilization to the commercial stage. Their religion, after the usual cultural lag due to the perpetuation of old religious forms, remained in the pastoral stage. The sacred objects were the reflections of the interests of a pastoral people. They were the stones, the animals, the trees, the gods of the soil who made the grass grow, and the springs of water. Those little desert whirlwinds with their annoying playfulness were inter- preted animistically as mischievous spirits, the genii, or "jinns," as they are sometimes called.</page><page sequence="7">450 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION These people with their antiquated religious concepts met the representatives of two of the highly advanced religions in their caravan trips to Syria and were in frequent contact with traders and others from the north. The contrast between his own reli- gion and the Christian and the Jewish religions of the seventh century could not fail to make a representative of this crude desert animism feel ashamed. Such was Mohammed's own ex- perience on his caravan trips to Syria. He was in the position of an awkward country boy in the city. The type of Christianity and of Judaism which a camel- driver would meet was not that of the intellectual centers. It was not the religion of the book. It was the religion of the traveler's camp on the outskirts of the town. It was tourist- camp religion. As we keep in mind the extent to which religious thinking and religious phraseology colored all the life of that region and that time, it is small wonder that Mohammed felt ashamed of his tribal paganism or that in his visions he saw worthies of these other more highly developed religions appear to him to claim his allegiance. That he tried to mold his own re- ligion after the pattern of these superior cultures is not only un- derstandable but psychologically inevitable. Here again we have an individual concerned with the solution of a social prob- lem, a vision, a metaphysical interpretation of the vision after the thought-patterns of the day, with the sense of the impor- tance of the vision which leads to the metaphysical interpreta- tion. It is more difficult to deal briefly with the social phase of Jesus' religious experience because of the traditional halo of reverence which has been cast about his life, and because of the long tradition of interpretation of his life apart from its environ- ment. There is to be noted an increasing trend toward a factual historical interpretation of Jesus. The real picture is more near- ly possible today than it was ten years ago, although there yet remains to be written anything like an adequate account. The social problem of Jesus' day was that of the nonfulfilment of the</page><page sequence="8">RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE AND SOCIAL PROGRESS 451 expected destiny of the "chosen people," expressed at that time in the domination on the part of the Roman Empire. This national mind, with its concept of being a chosen people, goes back to Moses' religious experience, and to his interpretation of his experience as an adoption contract on the part of the Midianite deity. The nonfulfilment of the adoption agreement on the part of this deity was a source of perpetual wonder to the Jewish nation, and a source of no little difficulty to the Jew- ish theologians. The three conventional answers are well known. The Sad- ducees offered a let-alone plan, based upon their economic pros- perity under the present arrangement. The Pharisees urged more exact religious conformity as the price of God's favor, and the Zealots urged direct military action. A young man known by the name of John, taking his cue from the earlier social prophets, offered a program of social justice as the road to winning God's favor, offering as a result of the return to social justice an apocalyptic redemption of the nation. It was this party with its social justice-apocalyptic solution that Jesus joined. It was during the initiation ceremony that he experi- enced that vision in which he received the assurance that he was "chosen of God" to win this destiny for his nation, the "chosen people." The problem-solving aspect of this religious experience continued through succeeding days as Jesus went apart to rethink the whole problem. The source narrative here is usually referred to as the "temptation of Jesus." He consid- ered and rejected the Sadducean solution in which the national ambition was to be sacrificed in the interests of the private com- mercial prosperity of a small class, saying, "Man shall not live by bread alone." In like manner he rejected the Zealot dream of military conquest, picturesquely ascribing the war program to the devil. He rejected the Pharisee dream of awaiting magic intervention from above as a reward for religious piety, char- acterizing it as an unworthy concept of God.</page><page sequence="9">452 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION An evaluation of these religious experiences shows four fac- tors which must be considered. They are as follows: I. A social problem exists, and the religious experience is the insight into the solution of this problem. 2. The problem arises of the distinction to be made, if any, between problem-solving which is religious and problem-solving which is non- religious. 3. The multitudinous and varied psychological effects of religious ex- periences of this type have drawn attention away from the social nature of these religious experiences. 4. The metaphysical explanations given to account for these religious experiences vary with the environment. I. In each case of the type of religious experience of which an example has been quoted here, there has been a social problem upon the solution of which the welfare of that tribe or that na- tion depended. The occurrence of these problems was due to a wide range of conditions, some political and economic, some the breakdown of the old patterns of that culture, and some the ever recurring problems of living. The time when old forms are broken and a new order is awaiting birth is a time peculiarly susceptible to such a religious experience. The problem in such cases is not one of religious belief or of religious practice, in the usual sense of that word. The point is that the kind of problems which were the gist of these religious experiences are analogous to our present-day social problems, including those of our political and our economic life, and have but little in common with any problems which would ordinarily be termed religious. By the same token these problems of these religious experiences have little in common with the type of emotional or mystical experience commonly dubbed religion. Had religion in the days of these religious experiences I have used for examples been as much a separate compartment of life as it has become since those days, it is not likely that the solu- tions to these problems would have been treated as religion at all. Moses would have been interpreted as a military leader, Gautama as a social reformer, Mohammed as a statesman, and</page><page sequence="10">RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE AND SOCIAL PROGRESS 453 Jesus as a philosopher-statesman. Today we deal with analo- gous problems, with strict attention paid to the boundary lines which delimit them not only as secular but further as political or economic or social. We are unable to see that the solution of our social problems is of the very essence of religion. In the artificial separation of our social problems and the process of their solution from the area of religion we have lost certain values. We have relegated the concept of metaphysical relationships with its "idea of the Holy" to the compartmental- ized type of religion, but we have denied it to the solution of our social problems. Without taking time to discuss the subject here, let me merely point out the extent to which this idea of a metaphysical relationship has served as the driving force to the solution of these problems. It was an important factor in each and every case of this religious-social problem solving. One might go on and add the story of a sense of vocation which played so large a part in the history of the Jewish people, and in the history of Protestant Christianity, expecially in New England Calvinism. The separation of religious and social problem-solving has further swung the principal attention of religion and of religion- ists in the modern compartmentalized form of religion to the other factors which were secondary in these creative religious experiences. Major attention has been put upon the psychologi- cal effects of the religious experiences, upon the individuals con- cerned in them, or upon the local metaphysical theories with which these individuals interpreted these experiences. These factors are there, and they are an important part of every reli- gious experience, but they were in each case subordinate to the social problem. 2. This brings us at once to the point of the distinction be- tween religious problem-solving and ordinary problem-solving. Moses saw a burning bush and led a successful slave deliver- ance, an experience traditionally labeled religious. A nation is harassed by economic confusion in which many of its citizens,</page><page sequence="11">454 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION hard-working, capable, and willing, are facing poverty and dis- tress. Yet that nation actually produces more wealth than it can use. So it tries to solve its problem by economic planning. Traditionally that isn't religion; it's just economics! Many writers have undertaken to compose accounts of this distinction. Some dwell upon the relative importance of the two types. This distinction presupposes some special kind of religious value for the experiences called religious. It carries with it a vestige of implication from the metaphysical associa- tions. This metaphysical factor will be discussed separately. The value of an experience is entirely relative to the situation and to the problems of the experiencer, personally and socially. It is impossible to classify experiences as religious or non-reli- gious in terms of their importance without falling into the dan- ger of making contraries into contradictories. This distinction presents a series of relative levels, not two opposite groups. 3. Our description of the next item in the attempt to dis- tinguish between religious and nonreligious problem-solving brings us to the third item, that of the emphasis upon the per- sonal and psychological effects of the religious experiences. It is not uncommon to make the distinction between the two types of problem-solving rest upon the effect of the experience upon the experiencer. As has been mentioned above, this emphasis is based upon the dropping-out of the picture of the social problem which was not only the central feature of the experience but the reason why there was any experience occurring at that time and to that person. The fact of these personal effects is well known to even the casual student of religion. It is a trait especially congenial to Protestant religious tradition to emphasise the individual ef- fects. Eugene W. Lyman' lists five "vital characteristics of re- ligion": a "sense of kinship, power, insight, integrity, and won- der." Henry Nelson Wieman" lists twelve qualities of personal- SMeaning and Truth of Religion (New York: Scribner's, 1933), chap. iii. 2Wieman and Westcott-Wieman, Normative Psychology of Religion (New York: Crowell, 1935), chap. iv.</page><page sequence="12">RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE AND SOCIAL PROGRESS 455 ity which he calls "marks of religious behavior." He offers a more detailed analysis than does Professor Lyman, but he adds only one item which is essentially different. This he calls "be- lief in the superhuman." There appear certain difficulties when religious experience is measured by its personal effects. So much that goes by the name of religious experience fails to produce these qualities of personality in any degree which makes the experience distin- guishable in value from the nonreligious experiences of life. So many of these qualities which were claimed as the fruit of reli- gious experience appear apart from that which is usually labeled religious that the attempt to measure religion in terms of its character products has been a perpetual source of embarrass- ment to theologians. It is characteristic of religious experience that those to whom these religious experiences came put little emphasis upon the personal effects of the experiences. They were so engrossed in the accomplishment of an all-absorbing task to the doing of which their religious experience was the act of dedication that they were little interested in the traits of personality which the experience produced. These effects are manifest, but apart from the social problem and the absorption of the individual in that problem they would not have occurred. Under these circum- stances attention to the personal traits engendered borders upon a perversion of religion, perhaps mild, but nonetheless unde- sirable. The situation seems to be analogous to the problem of hedon- ism as an ethical theory. Happiness or pleasure may be defend- ed as the value of conduct, but it cannot be defended as the ob- ject of conduct. Whether social or individual good is the aim of religion may be debated. I think it is an artificial issue. But the object of attention and of interest in religion must be the solu- tion of the social problem, not the pyschological effect of the experience upon the individual. 4. The metaphysical factor remains to be considered. It is</page><page sequence="13">456 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION always there. It seems to be an integral part of religious experi- ence. The taunt has been made that recent religion has become too humanistic and anthropocentric. This is doubtless true. The swing the other way comes as a sharp corrective. Yet nei- ther extreme is desirable. Religion became anthropocentric be- cause the various metaphysical theories connected with religion had become untenable. It now tends to become theocentric be- cause the inadequacies of humanism have become apparent. Yet a return to an old metaphysic is to make central a feature of religious experience which is properly secondary in importance. It is entirely evident that each of these religious experiences was explained in terms of whatever metaphysical theory was readily available at that time in the social group to which the individual belonged. Moses inherited a tradition of animism ap- proaching anthropomorphic personalism, which he identified with the Jah of the Midianite tribe in whose borders he had taken refuge. Adopting their life, he adopted their mental pat- terns. Gautama was submerged in the stream of amorphous idealism of the Vedic-Hindu world, and he ascribed his insight to the idealistic realities of the universe without making the limited personal identifications which would have been made in the Semitic world. Jesus and Mohammed inherited the same anthropomorphic-personalist tradition as had Moses, but with the benefit of a long intervening period of growth. To make our list of possible metaphysical explanations com- plete, we ought to add the impersonal processes of nature char- acteristic of the Confucian-Taoist group, and the causal deter- minism of the modern scientific world. The vividness of these metaphysical pictures has intrigued the childish fancy of the popular mind, and of minds supposedly not so popular to the point that the social nature of religious experience has become obscured. The obsession of the religious world with these various traditional streams of metaphysical explanation long after they have become untenable as systems of metaphysics has brought into disrepute not only those meta-</page><page sequence="14">RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE AND SOCIAL PROGRESS 457 physical systems but the religion popularly associated with them. Likewise the identification of religion with certain sys- tems of metaphysics has removed from our artificially compart- mentalized lives the sense of the holy which could have given to it a meaning and a direction which it lacks. For a protest against the obsession with the metaphysical to the obscuring of the social does not involve a denial of the importance of the metaphysical. Such a sense of the cosmic relationship of life and of religion is of vital importance, provided it be a recogni- tion of importance and not a theory of the nature of reality. It is a distinct loss to religion and to all the rest of life that re- ligion first monopolized metaphysics and then discredited it- self because of these metaphysical systems. Rudolf Otto quite correctly ascribed the significance of this metaphysical interest of religion to the "idea of the holy." But the presence of awe and of reverence does not thereby guarantee the concepts associated with this category. As to its credentials as an a priori category, as Otto claims, that is quite another matter. The concept of the a priori has been offered before as a bridge between the psychological and the metaphysical. Its credentials must stand before the bar of judgment with the total problem of the origin and nature of our categories. Any determination of the nature of the metaphysical must be made as a separate and independent inquiry apart from the na- ture of any religious experience. The result of such an inquiry might be any one of the theories mentioned above, or it might result in the acceptance of the more recent theory of levels or of organism. The recent revival of interest in mysticism is in danger of being confused with the metaphysical problem. As a process of mental hygiene it has its uses. As a technique of personality in- tegration and as a process of that phase of religious experience which is not problem-solving, but is aesthetic or appreciative in its nature, mysticism has indispensable values. In its aesthetic</page><page sequence="15">458 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION practice it doubtless does approach to reality. But it carries no metaphysical guaranty with it. In the creative periods of religion the occurrence of religious experience depends upon insight into the solution of social prob- lems. The accompaniments, secondary in nature, are a sense of the metaphysical association, and the psychological effects upon those persons involved. Obsession with these secondary items has obscured for us the religious nature of social problems and of social progress. Today we stand in a position quite similar to those other creative periods when the disintegration of old social patterns and the pressure of new needs is driving us to social re- construction. In these previous creative periods religion has in each case abandoned its quest for the social good, and has followed the bypaths of escape into theories of the metaphysical. In this diversion of interests it has escaped much persecution and much of its constructive opportunity. This diversion of religion was due in part to social factors and in part to the exporting of the religion to other lands. Today we need not be victimized by these forces. Gilbert Murray's picturesque phrase fits the cur- rent movement toward escape-it is "failure of nerve." We shall win the fulfilment of the hopes of a struggling hu- manity not by again escaping into the theories of the metaphysi- cal or by taking refuge in the personal experiences of aesthetic appreciations. We shall build the new civilization when we find the answers to these social problems, and, having found them, learn to apply to these insights the energy and the loyalty hitherto given to traditional religious forms and concepts. In these struggles for political and economic and social well-being we shall find the essence of religious experience. UNIVERSITY OF TULSA</page></plain_text>
