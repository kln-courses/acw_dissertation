Such cycles, called maximally-distributed, multi- aggregate cycles, maximize chromatic diversity over their spans while constraining harmonic vari- ety. The paper examines the role of maximally-distributed, multi-aggregate cycles (or segments thereof ) as compositional determinants in a variety of Bartók’s works. In particular, the paper con- siders how cyclic unfoldings are used in conjunction with the technique of near-aggregate comple- tion, how cycle adjacencies are often treated as salient harmonic entities in passages that feature cyclic unfoldings, and how the periodic intervals of such cycles are often manifest as salient trans- formational intervals in works that unfold those cycles.

In a simple cycle, the length of Example 3 presents a double interval cycle that imposes a the cycle is equivalent to the number of distinct pcs in the not-so-familiar ordering upon the familiar octatonic collec- cycle.

A 9-cycle (e.g. a descending arpeggiation through length of 8 because the SUM of 4 and 5 is 9, the GCD of 12 a fully-diminished seventh chord) has length 4, because and 9 is 3, and 2(12/3) is 8. Although I have illustrated the GCD(9,12) is 3, and 12/3 = 4.

Cycles generated by intervals 1, 5, 7, or 11 therefore call a (4,3)-cycle. Unlike the double interval cycle exist in only one distinct form (i.e. there is only one circle of of Example 3, the (4,3)-cycle is an example of a multi- fifths or one chromatic scale). aggregate cycle, a compound interval cycle that covers (or We will consider interval cycles to be equivalent under runs through the tones of ) more than one aggregate.6 The retrogression of their elements (i.e. under mod 12 inversion length of the (4,3)-cycle is 24: the cycle orders a 24-element of their generating intervals). The 7-cycle, for example, is collection in which each tone of the aggregate is represented structurally equivalent to the 5-cycle: unfolding forward twice. Example 4 depicts tones using upper- and lower-case through one is equivalent to going backwards through the letters, both to distinguish members of the two aggregates, other.

Any compound interval cycle can be decomposed into interlaced simple cycles whose generating interval is the sum of the compound cycle’s gen- erating intervals.8 It follows that any compound interval cycle, the sum of whose component generating intervals is coprime with 12—that is, whose component intervals sum to 1, 5, 7 or 11 semitones mod 12—will be a multi-aggregate cycle, since each component simple cycle will exhaust an  aggregate.9 This is a sufficient, but not necessary condition— in “Divided Arpeggios,” Bartók uses a quadruple multi- aggregate cycle with generating intervals that sum to 2 mod 12. The (4,3)-cycle of Example 4 exists in only one distinct example 3. The (4,5)-cycle ordering tones of an octatonic form, because the SUM of its generators, 7, is coprime with collection. 12, (i.e. d = 1). That single form can be reified either as the (4,3)-cycle, or as the (3,4)-cycle. That is, instead of starting with the big C at 12-o’clock and proceeding 4 semitones to e the scheme (“Circul”), using terms such as “Circumferens” to describe the path one follows therein. The first graphic circle of keys in print (Heinichen 1728, inserted at p. 837) realizes a different multi-aggregate cycle, the double (9,10)-cycle. 8 Note, for instance, that the (4,5)-cycle of Example 3 comprises two in- terlaced 9-cycles, because 4 and 5 sum to 9 mod 12. Lambert (1990, 54) generates compound interval cycles by explicitly “overlaying” simple cycles at particular intervallic offsets. Lambert, for example, derives our (4,3)-cycle by overlaying two 7-cycles at a distance (or offset) of 4 semi- tones. From Lambert’s perspective, the interval 3 in the sequential  interval series is a secondary feature, an accident of the generating  interval of the constituent simple cycles and their offset interval. The present paper takes a different view: we regard the particular sequence of generating intervals as primary, and view their SUM as a secondary (but still important) feature. Perle 1996 also derives double interval cy- cles (linearizations of what he calls ‘difference scales’) by combining simple cycles at different intervallic offsets (his ‘slide-rule’ operations). 9 In the case of Heinichen’s circle, the sum of the component intervals, example 4.

What is significant about the passage, however, is that the music at measure 9 is the 5-transpose of the opening material, a transposition level equivalent to the cycle’s periodicity: 5 is the mod 12 sum of 8, 8 and 1. Here, the cycle’s periodicity is an internal transformational rela- tionship that becomes projected externally as a relationship between statements of those cyclical materials, just as the T7 periodicity of the mediant circle is made externally manifest in the form of the dominant and subdominant relations in Hauptmann’s tone schemes. A similar procedure operates in the second etude.

Example 19(a) provides the opening of the  B-section, which, beginning in m. 30, presents nine tones that descend through the quadruple (3,4,3,3)-cycle, a  maximally-distributed, multi-aggregate cycle with the distri- bution vector 〈11,11,11,15〉. Example 20 illustrates the full cycle; an outer bracket identifies the A–G span unfolded (counterclockwise) at Example 19(a). In the subsequent measures, Bartók develops a two-part texture out of the upper and lower tetrachords of the un- folded span (A–F  –D–B and F–D  –B  –G respectively— Bartók omits the A  ). After m. 32, a freer passage ensues, in which various tetrachords continue the two-part dialogue. The B-section concludes with a return to the configuration of mm. 31–32, but with the tetrachords transposed up one semitone. Example 19(b) gives the transposed passage be- ginning at m. 39. Just as the original tetrachords at m. 31–32 were derived from a contiguous span of the (3,4,3,3)-cycle, so too do the transposed tetrachords at m. 39 represent a span of the (3,4,3,3)-cycle, shown by the inner bracket on Example 20 (embracing all tones except the central A). T1 is thus an internal intervallic relationship—the mod 12 sum or periodic interval of the (3,4,3,3)-cycle—that becomes exter- example 17.

Example 21(b) shows the comparable passage from the reprise. At m. 57, a tetrachord from the prevailing odd series labeled γ and one from the op- posing even series labeled δ are presented in dialogue. Again the counterpoint tightens, and the passage concludes  (mm. 66–67) with the vertical presentation of a tetrachord derived from the tones of γ plus δ, shown on the right side Example 21(b).31 Example 21 shows that the chordal state- ment at m. 66 that closes the reprise is the 2-transpose of the chordal statement at m. 25 that closes the exposition. Once again the T2 transformation, the periodic interval or mod 12 sum of the (3,5,3,3)-cycle, is an internal relation that is made manifest as an external relation between closing harmonies of the exposition and reprise. Example 22 summarizes these observations. The example shows the central role multi-aggregate cyclic materials play in the articulation of the work’s form: the A section is de- fined by the full presentation of the ‘even’ (3,5,3,3)-cycle; the B section is framed by the unfolding of segments of the (3,4,3,3)-cycle; and varied repetition in the reprise is achieved through the unfolding of the full ‘odd’ (3,5,3,3)- cycle.

Thus, the cyclic solution for SUM = 1 we determine that 2(7) = 14 = 2 mod 12 = -x, and that mod 12 is the (9,8,8)-cycle. The interested reader is invitedx therefore = 10. Since SUM = x + y, we know that y = SUM – to derive for themselves the triple interval cycles that instan-tiate the other maximally-distributed vector, 〈11,11,14〉. x = 7 – 10 mod 12 = 9. The (10,9)-cycle is therefore the SUM-7 multi-aggregate cycle that instantiates the distribu- tion vector 〈5,19〉; this is the cycle that underlies Johann A12. Example 27 presents a summary of all double, triple David Heinichen’s circle of keys. The other cycles with the and quadruple maximally-distributed multi-aggregate cycles same distribution vector are the (2,3)-cycle, the (2,9)-cycle, in a 12-tone chromatic universe. The representative cycles and the (10,3)-cycle. listed instantiate the non-parenthesized cycle sums; their in-verses (cycles which instantiate the parenthesized cycle A11. E sums) are not listed.XAMPLE. The method of finding the maximally dis- tributed cycles of a given cardinality is essentially the one il- lustrated in A9; the only difference is that the chosen distri- A13. The quadruple cycles on Example 27 for which SUM = bution vector deviates minimally from a maximally even 2 and which have the distribution vector 〈10,14〉 (marked distribution, and also satisfies criteria discussed in the main with a “†”) such as the (3,5,3,3)-cycle of “Divided Arpeg- text (i.e. the values must sum to the cycle’s length, and no gios,” though not maximally distributed in an absolute sense, values can be divisible by j in a j-tuple cycle). For instance to are nonetheless the maximally distributed cycles that have an find the triple-interval cycles that instantiate the maximally- ordered pair-wise distribution of tones. The cycles are each distributed vector 〈10,13,13〉, we will assume that k0 = 0, and composed of two interlaced, maximally-distributed, double- therefore that k whole-tone cycles—odd and even forms of the (8,6)-cycle.10 = k23 = 0. We know there is a solution for each mod 12 SUM = 1, 5, 7 and 11. We will solve for the For example, on Example 17, members of the even (8,6)- case where SUM = 1 mod 12; the remaining cycles are its cycle—0, 8, 2, A, 4, 0, 6, 2, 8, 4, A, 6—are located “on the M hour” positions, starting at 12:00 on the outer circle;5, M7 and M11 associates. Since 10 = 1 mod 3, k10 repre- sents the case where α = β + 1 = γ + 1, and since m = α + β + members of the odd (8,6)-cycle—1, 9, 3, B, 5, 1, 7, 3, 9, 5, B, γ, we get 3β + 1 = 10, or β = 3 (and consequently α = 4 and γ 7—are located “on the half hour” positions, starting at 10:30 = 3). Recalling the linear congruence for the case where m = on the outer circle. The other five distinct maximally- 1 mod 3, distributed quadruple cycles of the same type arise from dif-ferent relative orientations of the two interlaced double- β(SUM) = -x (mod 12), whole-tone cycles. The (8,6)-cycle has a 〈5,7〉 distribution we substitute SUM = 1 and β = 3 to get 3 = -x mod 12, and vector. The 〈10,14〉 distribution vector of the SUM = 2 thus x = 9. Similarly, since 23 = 2 mod 3, k23 represents the quadruple cycles, a doubling of the 〈5,7〉 vector, arises from case where α = β = γ +1, and since m = α = β = γ we get 3β - the intercalation of the two constituent (8,6)-cycles. 1 = 23, or β = 8 (and consequently α = 8 and γ = 7).
