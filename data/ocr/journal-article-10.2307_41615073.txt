His first decorative initial letter was published there in 1867, and his last cartoon ten months before his death in 1910. Like other Punch artists, Sambourne found that his creativity was slowly sapped by a demanding routine. Before these demands overwhelmed him, however, Sambourne illustrated a number of books, including two Macmillan reissues of popular works, Charles Kingsley's Water Babies and Three Tales of Hans Andersen. These were perhaps his highest achievements. Sambourne was born in 1844 and started his working life as an engineer's draughtsman. He spent only a few months studying drawing at the South Kensington School of Art, and this near absence of artistic training contributed to an insecurity about his work. His response was to attempt an obsessive accuracy of detail, where a more confident illustrator would have given a general impression. Impressionism, in Sambourne's eyes, was a cover for laziness. Unfortunately, although Sambourne's life from the 1880s can be documented through his diaries, his wife's diaries, and his correspondence, the early years remain shadowy. He cherished a desire to become an artist, and to escape from his mundane occupation. 'I was seized with an unconquerable longing to try and draw anything and everybody I encountered. It was, in short, the ruling passion with me.'1 'I put some on wood, without any previous knowledge &amp; they appeared at once.'2 Sambourne's early work is of uneven quality. His turn for caricature resulted in some rather crude drawings, but his gift for the fantastic released him from his inhibitions. In Punch , he wittily caricatured politicians, particularly Gladstone, in his initial letters for parliamentary sketches, 'The Essence of Parliament', often showing well-known heads perched on top of animal or bird bodies. Sambourne began his successful 'Fancy Portrait' series, presenting famous men in grotesque guise, in 1880. In one of the best known, Oscar Wilde appears as a sunflower. Like the 'Essence of Parliament' figures, Wilde has no body at all, only a stem. This was a well tried comic tradition, but, for Sambourne, who could catch a facial likeness but who had some initial difficulty in drawing the human figure, the style had many advantages. The young Sambourne supplemented his income with book illustrations. Like his Punch drawings, these were varied in style and quality. Some of the best were of landscapes. He produced a set of Venetian scenes for an elaborate edition of Byron's Childe Harold in 1878, and a series of sketches for two books about summer expeditions, Our Autumn Holiday ôn French Rivers , written by a fellow-oarsman, James Lynam Molloy, and Our Holiday in the Scottish Highlands , with Arthur À Beckett, published in 1874 and 1876 respectively. The 1860s revolution in book illustration, with the work of artists such as John Everett Millais and Fred Walker, might never have taken place for all its effect upon Sambourne. He struck out in another, and much less naturalistic, tradition, regarding Dürer as his master. He owned a print of Knight, Death and the Devil and towards the end of his life said that he had tried to emulate the German master: 'I have endeavoured to formulate a style of drawing which shall tell its own tale as simply as possible; from the fact that the great bulk of my cartoon work is done in an up-to-date high-pressure sort of way, and the engraver's time is short, I give him little cross-hatching, and rely for effect in single lines of varying thickness.'3 On his staircase, Sambourne hung two prints by Dürer's successor among modern German draughtsmen, Alfred Rethel. One is the famous Death as Friend , which was deeply admired by many of Sambourne's generation of English illustrators. The other is the related Death at the Masked Ball , the design of which Sambourne used for a cartoon of June 1892, 'Dissolution as the enemy of the London season'. For many years, Sambourne's superior at Punch was John Tenniel, the chief political cartoonist. Tenniel worked rapidly without a model, something which Sambourne could never do, and of which he disapproved. When Henry Lucy took over 'The Essence of Parliament' and demanded that the drawings should be made on the spot Sambourne withdrew from the column. He spent hours, he said, 'investigating a point before I begin to draw, in order that some incidental fact many be accurate'.4 Tenniel and Sambourne shared a preoccupation with drawing animals. Both were keen sportsmen and members of a riding club, horses being a frequent feature of Tenniel's work. Tenniel seems, however, to have had a number of standard drawings, which he reproduced in different situations, as he did with his anthropomorphic cartoons, where the Russian bear and the Austrian eagle continue the practice of using animals as a shorthand for nations. In his drawing of 'Alice with the Lion and the Unicorn', for Alice in Wonderland of 1865, Tenniel, like Sambourne, uses large heads and small bodies, clearly differentiating the two animals in personality, the neatly dressed courtier/business-man Unicorn and the shambling Lion. Sambourne went much further than Tenniel, however, in introducing an enormous range of animals, fish and birds, but he is never as anthropomorphic as Tenniel, presumably because of his determination to reproduce the actual appearance of the animals themselves. In Punch , as in book illustration, Tenniel's influence was evidently important to him. The Water Babies , produced by the same publisher, Macmillan, was intended as a successor to the Alice books. Sambourne and Tenniel both belong to a long tradition of animal illustrators. Editions of Aesop's Fables have been popular since the 14th century, and it is surprising that Sambourne never worked on one. Tenniel's version came out in 1848, Ernest Griset's in 1869 and Walter Crane's in 1887 ( The Baby's Own Aesop). The career of Griset, who was an almost exact contemporary of Sambourne, presents a remarkable contrast. Both men were illustrators specialising in animal subjects, but Griset failed to diversify, and his departure from Punch in 1869, after only two years on the staff, probably cleared the way for Sambourne's own appointment. One of Sambourne's favourite animal artists was Edwin Landseer. A print of his Rat Catchers (1821) still hangs at Sambourne's house, 18 Stafford Terrace, London W8. This violent scene of animal life, where three dogs and a ferret are killing rats, is a good indication of Landseer's importance to Sambourne. If he was not a strictly anthropomorphic artist, Landseer often implicitly relates animals to human life. Sambourne adapted one of Landseer's most horrifying paintings, a polar landscape inspired by the fate of the franklin 48</page><page sequence="2">Volume II, No.3 Tbe BRITISH ART Journal expedition, Man Proposes , God Disposes (1864), for a cartoon of 1886. Landseer's image of bears eating a human skeleton is transposed into a comment on Gladstone's failure to carry proposals for Irish Home Rule through Parliament, a defeat which led to his resignation. In the early 1880s, Sambourne discovered photography, which saved him many hours at the Zoo. 'I use photographs so that I may secure absolute accuracy. I design all my compositions very carefully and use photographs to fill in details, such as the way a sword hangs, how many buttons a man has on his coat and so on. Photography is a good servant, but I am very careful not to let it by my master.'5 Before long, however, Sambourne became obsessed with photography for its own sake. There were at least 35,000 prints in his house when he died, most of them by Sambourne himself. Sambourne's usual models were his family, household staff and friends. If no one was around, he posed himself, sometimes with a lay model. The facial expressions were irrelevant, it was the physical stance which he needed to record. For some female figures, Sambourne hired models, listed in his diaries. At his artists' club, he posed them nude, to the dismay of his wife: 'More of those hateful photos, Lin wastes time, late with work.'6 Sambourne was an admirer of classical sculpture, and hung photographic prints of famous works in his house. Like Tenniel, he sometimes gave his idealised female figures a classical physique. His adaptation of a photographic image for a cartoon drawing can be clearly seen in an example taken from Punch for April 22 1900. This featured a symbolic figure of Ireland waving farewell to Queen Victoria after her state visit. The photograph which Sambourne used for the purpose shows a partly clad model, her 'wind-blown' drapery held out by two clearly visible threads. In the cartoon, the outline of the figure is closely reproduced from the photograph, but the woman is now decorously clothed in a shamrock embroidered dress (Pis 1, 2). In 1880, Alexander Macmillan and Sambourne began to plan an illustrated edition of Charles Kingsley's The Water Babies , which had first been published in 1863 with two illustrations by Noel Paton. Paton's two idealised roundels, and particularly his 'Charity' frontispiece, with Mrs Doasyouwouldbedoneby and the water babies, gives a religious emphasis to the book, quite unlike the raw aggression of Sambourne's woodcuts. The Paton edition was reprinted in 1872 with extra illustrations by Percival Skelton, two plates and a series of initial letters. Skelton's vague designs, with their gothic landscapes and tiny 'fairy picture' figures, are considerably inferior to the work of either Paton or Sambourne. If the initiative came from Macmillan, Sambourne, with his talent for the grotesque, was an obvious choice. The original plan was for 40 woodcuts, including initials, inset plates and full pages, and a fee of £250-£300. 'The drawings wd. be done on paper &amp; reproduced. The sole rights &amp;c for reproduction being with you but the original drawings with me [Sambourne]'.7 Sambourne woodcuts through the began were book added 'in from earnest' beginning later. in The January to illustrations end, 1882. although He worked to a few the Sambourne through the book from beginning to end, although a few woodcuts were added later. The illustrations to the opening chapters, before Tom the chimney-sweep falls into the river, are typical of Sambourne's work at the period. The human figures are rather insecure, the animals better realised. The illustrator evidently chose episodes with horses and dogs wherever he could. Once Tom is in the river, however, Sambourne gets into his stride. Some of the finest illustrations are the decorated letters for Kingsley's poems. In their complexity of design, they represent a different level of illustration from the textual woodcuts, which are more closely related to the events of the story. In 'Clear and Cctol', 49 1 'Farewell to Ireland', preliminary photograph taken by Linley Sambourne, 12 April 1900, Linley Sambourne House 2 'Farewell to Ireland', Linley Sambourne, Punch , 25 April 1900</page><page sequence="3">The BRITISH ART Journal Volume II, No.3 a number of elements associated with rivers, willow tree, water spirit, aquatic creatures, boats in a harbour, are gathered into a single decorative design (PI 3). Yet, although the parts are carefully and exactly drawn, the scale is deliberately unrealistic, the tree being about half the size of the dominating figure. Sambourne's children, Maud and Roy, were the models for Tom and Ellie, but he seems to have used photographs rather than posing the children themselves. As work went on, Roy, born in 1878, became too old for Tom, and Sambourne records drawing Ellie, climbing on the rocks, at a time when Maud was seriously ill with measles. Maud's doll was used for the illustration to the song 'I once had a little doll, dears', and Sambourne was furious when he found it out of position on returning to work in the morning. For one initial letter, a 'T', he used photographs of a nude model and of a fish, in order to draw a mermaid. Then, obsessed as ever with accuracy, he placed a doll into a bottle of water to check the exact effect. In the text of The Water Babies, Tom is a watching figure, the intermediary between the reader and the strange underwater world. In the illustrations, the water creatures appear large and predatory, in striking contrast to the tiny figure of Tom. Swimming in front of an otter with gnashing teeth, or seated beside a gigantic lobster (as a noted bon viveur , Sambourne would have had no difficulty in finding one), the naked human boy seems alarmingly vulnerable (PI 4). All the animals for The Water Babies were carefully drawn from actual specimens. Some, like the dead fish or the stuffed otter, were brought home, others were studied and sketched in the Zoo and the Natural History Museum. Not until 1884 did Sambourne set up his own aquarium. He must have used a Museum specimen for the tiny drawing of a caddis, an evolving mayfly, hung about with a mass of small objects. Sambourne made several visits to the Museum in April 1882, drawing fish for a cartoon showing Lord Rosebery. This material was presumably used in its turn for The Water Babies. On 15 and 19 May he drew from a dragonfly for the illustration of Tom witnessing the processes of metamorphosis, a subject which greatly fascinated the Victorians (PI 5). The baby had been drawn separately (and apparently from a photograph) on 11 May. In September 1882, Sambourne was fishing in Scotland, and his diary reflects a close connection between sport and work. 'Photoed' now begins to appear as an entry. 'Caught big trout in burn. 3/4 pound'; 'Photoed trout'; 'Pike fishing in Loch Shene'; 'Photoed'; 'After lunch went to wood to sketch'; 'Started early with lunch and drew Burnie for WB.'8 The trout photograph was apparently the source for one illustration. Another was taken from a photograph of the first salmon Sambourne ever caught, in September 1883. Some of the drawings and photographs did double duty. Sambourne was also working on a diploma certificate for the Fisheries Exhibition, an enormously complicated drawing, featuring, like The Water Babies, scenes from seas and rivers. Work on the illustrations was fitted in around Punch commitments, and came in fits and starts. Sambourne's diary sometimes records several days, or even weeks of Water Babies, a single drawing taking him two or three days. A good many were done on holiday, when other pressures were less. Then came weeks of apparent inactivity. By March 1883, Sambourne had done over fifty illustrations, and reckoned to do 20 more. Apologising for the delay, and asking Macmillan for an advance, he explained, 'I wish I could work quicker. This I will say that there will not be a careless drawing or one that I need to be ashamed of in the Water Babies. '9 'Believe me,' Sambourne told Macmillan in September 1883, 'no one can feel the delay so much as I do myself.'10 Similar letters were sent through 1884, and, by August of that year, Sambourne had done 70 illustrations and had 14 more to do, 'mostly small'.11 Sambourne was now planning the volume, and marking up a copy to show where the drawings should go. Throughout the final negotiations for the arrangement of the book, he insisted that the plates should be placed next to the passage they illustrated, not on another page. On the whole he had his way. The larger plates are surrounded by a framing line, and Sambourne wanted this to vary according to the size and shape of the plate, but this battle he lost. Each page is framed by a standard line. The book was intended for the traditional Christmas market, but, when this chance was missed in 1884, Sambourne rationalised the disappointment by telling Macmillan that The Water Babies , not being new, was better published away from Christmas. The last illustrations were some of the most difficult. Sambourne struggled with the massive seated figure of the sea- 50 3 'Clear and Cool', initial letter, Linley Sambourne, The Water Babies, 1885, Chapter 1 4 'Tom and the Lobster', The Water Babies, 1885, Chapter 4</page><page sequence="4">Volume II, No.3 Tbe BRITISH ART Journal goddess, Mother Carey, a contorted version of the classical statues he so much admired. He decided not to include a drawing of Mrs Bedonebyasyoudid because, he told Macmillan, he thought her too unattractive. Another late illustration, the drawing for which still hangs in Sambourne's house, shows the degenerate race of the Doasyoulikes (PI 6). This illustration raises the question of how far Sambourne felt himself to be in sympathy with Kingsley's morality Did he accept the book's beliefs, or was he simply attracted by the idea of drawing strange animals and fantastic creatures? The Water Babies has a number of counter-evolutionary aspects. Tom apparently steps back in the evolutionary chain, adapting from land to water instead of vice versa. Near the end of the book, Tom and Ellie are shown a series of photographs of the Doasyoulikes, a race so hedonistic and lazy that they eventually degenerate into apes. 'Why,' said Tom, They are growing no better than savages.' 'And look how ugly they are getting,' said Ellie. 'Yes; when people live on poor vegetables instead of roast beef and plum-pudding, their jaws grow large, and their lips grow coarse, like the poor Paddies who eat potatoes.' Mrs Doasyouwouldbedoneby tells the children that, as the degeneration continued, the Doasyoulikes became more . . . like the dumb beasts, who only do what they like, the stupider and clumsier they grew; till at last they were past all cure, for they had thrown their own wits away. . . Folks say now that I can make beasts into man, by circumstance, and selection, and competition, and so forth. Well, perhaps they are right; and perhaps, again, they are wrong... But let them recollect this, that there are two sides to every question, and a downhill as well as an uphill road; and, if I can turn beasts into men, I can, by the same laws of circumstance, and selection, and competition, turn men into beasts'. 51 5 'Tom and the Dragon-Fly', The Water Babies , 1885, Chapter 3, 6 'The Doasyoulikes', The Water Babies , 1885, Chapter 6 7 'She began to cry most bitterly', Linley Sambourne, 'Thumbelisa', Three Tales of Hans Andersen , 1910 8 'She came to the door of a field-mouse's home', 'Thumbelisa', Three Tales of Hans Andersen, 1910</page><page sequence="5">The BRITISH AXT Journal Volume II, No.3 10 '"Soldiers! Soldiers!"', The Dauntless Tin Soldier', Three Tales of Hans Andersen , 1910 Sambourne's drawing of the Doasyoulikes represents their progress downwards, with the figures at the top more human in appearance, and those at the bottom most like apes. Above them, a sensuous female figure dominates the composition. Sambourne worked on the plate for three days or more in December 1884, using photographs of apes and bears made in the previous summer at the Natural History Museum and the Zoo. Sambourne was aware of evolutionary theory. There is even a caricatured drawing of Thomas Huxley and Richard Owen, the first director of the Natural History Museum, in The Water Babies. It illustrates a passage where the narrator (evidently with Huxley's atheism in mind), declares that even the greatest scientists are unable to state that something (in this case a water baby) cannot exist. Soon after the completion of the Doasyoulike drawing, another request for better terms went to Macmillan, and eventually £400 was agreed upon for the whole project. Sambourne pointed out that, drawing by drawing, the work was worth £1000. He explained that the lavishness of illustration had been necessary for the book: &amp; after all I am the principal sufferer - if any. ... I have used every possible effort I am capable of to make the edition a good and lasting specimen of my work. I know with the expenses &amp; at first how unremunerative illustrated books must be. - The heavy cost of engraving etc. Sambourne had to console himself with the thought of selling the illustrations. The Water Babies was eventually published for Christmas 1885. At 12s. 6d. it was expensive, especially when the Paton edition was still selling for 2s. 6d. Subscriptions, however, were good, and the 'trade has taken kindly to the book'.15 Sambourne took a copy to the weekly Punch dinner, and, after business, showed it, with justifiable pride, to John Tenniel. Having Sambourne finally embarked brought The upon Water a new Babies Macmillan to completion, project, Sambourne embarked upon a new Macmillan project, drawings for a selection of stories by Hans Andersen. He began work on 5 October 1885, before completing The Water Babies , with a drawing for Thumbelisa , the story of the tiny girl who nearly marries first a mole and then a toad. On 12 October, he photographed a toad, though not for the first time. It was a failure, and was repeated three days later. The toad photographs were used both for a Punch cartoon, and for two 'Thumbelisa' drawings. In the larger of these, one of Sambourne's finest illustrations, the toad has marooned Thumbelisa on an island among the waterlilies (PI 7). In a burst of energy, Sambourne rapidly followed this with a drawing of Thumbelisa with a swallow, but his flying start was not maintained. It was January 1886 before he began again, drawing the old toad approaching Thumbelisa in her little bed. Again, as in some of the Water Babies drawings, the illustration gives a sense of inversion and human vulnerability, with a huge and threatening animal and a tiny human being. The very feminine Thumbelisa, in her light and flowing dress, is overshadowed by a darkly shaded animal. The frightening effect is reduced by showing the toad in spectacles, borrowed from an optician for the purpose. More drawings, probably for Thumbelisa , were made in February 1886, but Sambourne made no further headway in that year. Macmillan and Sambourne signed a contract in November 1886. This was for 50 drawings, for five Andersen stories. Sambourne was to be paid £400 (the same as The Water Babies overall). Macmillan wisely inserted a penalty clause. If the drawings were not completed in three years, the agreement would be cancelled and Sambourne would repay his £100 advance. The drawings were to be reproduced by line block, the technical work being done by Emery Walker, the photographer and designer associated with William Morris. Sambourne liked the method: 'No wood could have done it', but, once he started sending his drawings to Walker, was made anxious by the need to 52 9 Maud Sambourne, photograph taken by Linley Sambourne, Linley Sambourne House,</page><page sequence="6">Volume II, No.3 Tbe BRITISH ART Journal 'draw a little simpler', and to work on a smaller scale.16 Could he, he wondered, use some of the larger drawings as a double-page spread? 'Others do.'17 'I'm confident of success with such subjects,' Sambourne told Macmillan. 'It ought to go like anything in America &amp; also in Germany.'18 But, once again, momentum was not maintained. From this time on, Sambourne's diary records more and more social and sporting events, and, apart from the Punch work, almost no drawing. Not until May 1887 does he report beginning on the drawing of 'mouse and mole' for Thumbelisa , and later in the same year, he completed the illustration of Thumbelisa with the fieldmouse (PI 8). Circumstances sometimes favoured the project. On 6 March 1888, Sambourne woke with a bad cold and, unable to go out, spent that day and the next doing an Andersen drawing, presumably Thumbelisa flying to the south with the swallow. One more drawing was completed in June 1888. Sambourne had promised the set to Macmillan for September 1888, so that the book could come out for Christmas. 'I have been collecting studies &amp; notes for the animals part of them &amp; am prepared to go right ahead now. Which I am anxious to do on my own account.'19 Over a year later, in December 1889, he was saying much the same thing. He had studies and notes for The Dauntless Tin Soldier and The Ugly Duckling , and had a drawing on 'stone compressed chalk paper which is prepared especially for process printing', as a trial for Walker. This method, he assured Macmillan, would cut down the time, 'having the white &amp; half tones makes them effective'.20 One of the Tin Soldier drawings, dated 1890, was based upon a photograph of Sambourne's daughter, Maud, taken some years before (Pis 9, 10). From this time on, Sambourne's correspondence with Macmillan becomes even more sporadic. In 1890 he was suggesting a completely different project, for a travel book on Norway, which came to nothing. Macmillan was promised the rest of the Andersen drawings for November 1892, but in July Sambourne wrote with more excuses. The work for the Christmas Punch 'Almanack' was overwhelming him. His 'conscience was sorely pained', but he would do 'better drawings than 5 years ago', had refused any other work, and would do nothing else until these were completed.21 In 1894, another effort was made. Three drawings, apparently all for the Tin Soldier , were sent in. Returning the proofs, Macmillan asked for eight drawings which Sambourne had borrowed to reproduce elsewhere. Sambourne now, more than eight years after the beginning of the project, chose his five stories, The Tin Soldier , Thumbelisa and The Little Mermaid (all of which were partly done), and The Ugly Duckling and The Storks , on neither of which Sambourne seems to have begun. After Sambourne's death in August 1910, Macmillan published the 22 drawings in a handsome volume bound in blue cloth with gold lettering and a gold vignette of Thumbelisa being carried off by a cockchafer. After publication, the original drawings duly returned to the Sambourne family, and some of the best of them still hang on the walls of 18 Stafford Terrace, which is now open to the public as a museum under the management of the Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. 1 Evening Standard , 3 August 1910. 2 Letter to MH Spielmann, 25 August 1907, Punch Archive. 3 'The Political Cartoon', Magazine of Art (1892), p 46. 4 Yorkshire Post, 4 August 1910. 5 77/ Bits, 20 August 1910. 6 Shirley Nicholson, A Victorian Household , 1988, pp 15-6. 7 Macmillan Papers, British Library, Add.
