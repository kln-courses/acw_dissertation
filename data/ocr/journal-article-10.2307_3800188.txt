<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Politics of Extinction. By Lewis Regenstein. Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc., New York. 1975. xxiv, 280pp. Illus. $9.95. Lewis Regenstein is Executive Vice President of the Fund for Animals in Washington, D.C. The foreward is written by Cleveland Amory, author of Man Kind. These facts set the tenor of the en- tire book. The theme seems to be complete pro- tection of all wildlife. Really, this is an "anti-kill" book. The protec- tionists' viewpoint, referred to as "our case," is overly dramatic. There are many generalities such as "almost gone" and "nearly wiped out" scattered throughout the book. Statements are made that the purpose of the book is to "strip bare hunting as a sport." Animals are not killed, they are "slaughtered." Hunting is referred to as a "brutal luxury," and the charge is made that animals that are shot by hunters usually die a horrible death. Whenever the words management, sport, sus- tained yield, experimental, scientific, overpopula- tion, and harvest are used, they are in quotation J. Wildl.

Hunting is blamed for the plight of all species on the extinct, endangered, or threatened lists. Very seldom is habitat destruction even referred to as a possible reason for low population. Cer- tainly, there are many impacts of civilization, be- sides hunting or harvest, that have had much to do with the demise of many wild animals. For example, what would we do with the herds of bison if we still had them? Some of the great predators simply cannot tolerate people in the near proximity. Certainly, we can't get rid of people. Medical researchers are accused of torture. Aquaria and zoos are all bad. Credit is not given to the wildlife manager for the good jobs done in re-establishing elk, pronghorn, beaver, and tur- key over much of our nation where habitat is suited. Credit is not given for research, refuges, restoration, or any positive effort. Radiotelemetry is referred to as "putting a harness of some sort" on an animal. Anthropomorphism is prevalent. Animals kiss and have brothers and sisters. They show grief and have loved ones. Animals are given credit for farming. Some even practice birth control. The book is well written and attractive. Pictures, as would be expected, depict many tortured, starv- ing, and dead animals. Treatment of legislation is especially interesting, if it weren't so biased against the government and wildlife professionals. It is a shame that it is necessary to resort to innuendos, name calling, generalities, and many derogatory statements relative to a problem as important today as management of our natural resources, including wildlife. Why can't the two factions, the protectionists and the harvesters, agree that the wildlife manager is educated and really does know what he or she is doing? Why can't the two sides appreciate dedication, research, and ability that really would result in the best mode of operation for all concerned? I believe wildlife professionals would profit greatly by reading this book or one similar to it. It would shock them into realizing the severity of the anti-harvest, anti-management movement and the capability of those associated with it.-D. L.
