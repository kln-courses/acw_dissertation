<plain_text><page sequence="1">MORE ON LAMP'S "FIRST WORD" In his essay "Africa Centered" (First Word, Spring 1999), Frederick Lamp raises impor- tant questions for all of us interested in the arts of Africa. I feel compelled to respond not only because he refers directly to my research (part of my work involves "the recent under- mining of secret societies by the government of Guinea") but also because his description of several problems confronting the field, though accurate, were miscontextualized or attributed to peripheral reasons (the new gen- eration's frivolousness or lack of gumption, for example). Lamp's first three explanations for the shift away from "cassical" Africanist art scholarship- the "what's up," "traditional," and "trendiness" factors-refer to a set of related phenomena. Graduate students do not want to study what earlier scholars have studied, opting instead for new developments in terms of both content and analytical frameworks. In the process, they often criticize the work of their mentors. Here Lamp is on target, but I wonder how the present crop of young Africanist art historians differs in this regard from other ambitious, bright scholars in the humanities over the last fifty years. The Oedipal dynamics of advisor-student relations and an academic star system that rewards overblown and iconoclastic claims to originality have long promoted such tendencies. Lamp's generation of scholars certainly had the same reaction to their elders, "discovering" the im- portance of women's arts and understudied media such as ceramics and textiles. While Lamp seems to imply that today's upstarts dis- regard the important work of past generations and offer superficially trendy analyses in its place, we younger students of Africa might respond that such flimsy scholarship has always existed and is soon forgotten. Moreover, its exis- tence is no excuse for blanket dismissals of the field's younger practitioners. Lamp's next two explanations, the "isola- tionist" and "globalization" factors, are again best understood as structural shifts in the academy, particularly at the level of the fund- ing agencies. For all the reasons Lamp enumer- ates, much of Africa has become marginal to the strategic and economic interests of the U.S. These priorities undoubtedly have an indirect yet major impact on the decisions of such orga- nizations as Fulbright, Fulbright-Hays, and the SSRC, which provide financial support for the lion's share of research on the arts of Africa. In my view this has little to do with Americans' "disappearing fascination with other cultures," much less with waning "idealism that made us willing to suffer mosquitoes and instability in the Third World for a cause." Like the director of the UCLA Coleman African Studies Center whom Lamp quotes, graduate students are (I would guess) retooling the presentation of their research not to avoid the rigors of Africa but to do research there at all. ) Anthropomorphic Harp Zande, Zaire Height: 291/2 Lamp's sixth explanation, which he calls the "Western gaze" factor, seems to me much more fundamental to the future of the study of the arts of Africa, and it deserves close at- tention. "The postmodern fear of exoticism," Lamp writes, "has rendered Africanists un- easy and conflicted." This part of his essay echoes the curricular battles of the 1980s and '90s over the canon, political correctness, and identity politics. Museums have been an espe- cially contested territory in these culture wars (and have also become a more prominent topic in Triennial papers), but the point at issue in Lamp's essay is the shift away from "classical" African topics in recent conferences and dis- sertation research. This brings up Lamp's very particular use of statistics. Nearly all of his points are made with percentages, namely a shift in the share of papers dealing with "classical" topics from 60% presented at the 1989 ACASA Triennial to 30% at the 1995 and 1998 Triennials. Similarly, he gives percentages for the topics of recent disser- tations as well as for Ph.D. research-in-progress. But the key to all these figures is the two-sen- tence paragraph where he writes that in real numbers "classical" papers at the Triennials have "actually declined from 65 in 1989 to only 53 in 1998. Meanwhile the number of presenta- tions on contemporary has quadrupled and on the diaspora has tripled." Thus, while the per- centage of "classical" Triennial papers dropped 50% (from 60% to 30%) between 1989 and 1998, the actual number of papers fell by 18.5% (from autumn 1999 * atrican arts 65 to 53)-a more modest decline, especially in light of the funding shifts noted above. So why should scholars of "classical" African arts begrudge the areas of contempo- rary and diasporic African art scholarship the kind of spectacular growth that they them- selves experienced from 1965 to 1985? My own guess (I can conduct no polls as I live in a tiny village without running water, electric- ity, phone, or e-mail) is that these changes are linked to larger demographic shifts in Afri- canist graduate programs, and audiences for African art. More Africanist and African-dias- poric students are earning Ph.D.s in art history and affiliated fields. While some are working on "classical" topics, others are not. I can only speculate that the reasons for such choices range from career strategization to areas of pre- graduate-school expertise (many students of contemporary arts are themselves practition- ers) to simple intellectual curiosity. Among the young scholars I know, postmodern theory is something we discuss and argue about, but it is far from determining our research agendas. Indeed, I would characterize the recent crop of graduate students as "post-post-positivist." We have read the critiques and tried to implement their lessons in our work, but we are not para- lyzed with existential dread at the thought of writing about an other. Lamp's last explanation for the shift in African-art studies is the "denial" factor: we are afraid to admit that "classical" arts are real- Continued on page 85 9</page><page sequence="2">MUTE TESTIMONIES Objects in the Press of History: Confessing the Past and Re-Shaping Memory; AFFINITIES Paintings, sculptures, craftwork, and photographs demonstrating cross-cultural interaction in South Africa South African National Gallery Cape Town, South Africa SOUTHERN AFRICAN TRIBAL ART Afri-Karner Museum Franschhoek, South Africa SOUTHERN AFRICAN BEADWORK AND ARTIFACTS Fiona le Blanc Gallery Johannesburg, South Africa LINKS; THE HORSTMANN COLLECTION OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN ART; THE FOUNDATION COLLECTION; NEW, USED &amp; IMPROVED Contemporary South African art; SECULAR AND SPIRITUAL: Objects of Mediation on Views from Within Traditional South African art Johannesburg Art Gallery Johannesburg, South Africa THE PERMANENT COLLECTIONS AT MUSEUMAFRICA MuseumAfrica Johannesburg, South Africa TRADITIONAL SOUTH AFRICAN ARTIFACTS; CONTEMPORARY SOUTH AFRICAN CRAFTS Kim Sacks Gallery, Johannesburg, South Africa AFRICAN ART AND ANTIQUITIES Totem-Meneghelli Gallery Johannesburg, South Africa THE STANDARD BANK COLLECTION OF AFRICAN ART University of the Witwatersrand Art Galleries Johannesburg, South Africa ART FROM WEST AFRICA Totem Galleries: Rosebank, Carlton, Sandton Johannesburg, South Africa AFRICAN ART La Rochelle Gallery, Paarl, South Africa SISONKE: SYMBOLS OF IDENTITY; TRADITIONAL AFRICAN ART; STORY OF PEOPLE IN SOUTHERN AFRICA Archaeology of South African Stone and Iron Ages, San rock art Natal Museum Pietermaritzburg, Natal, South Africa PIPPA SKOTNES; TRANSFORMED FIBRES Pretoria Art Museum Pretoria, South Africa AFRICAN ART Les Art International, Saxonwold, South Africa TSONGA AND NORTH SOTHO ART Tzaneen Museum Tzaneen, South Africa PERMANENT COLLECTION National Gallery of Zimbabwe, Harare, Zimbabwe ART FROM ABORIGINAL AUSTRALIA National Gallery of Australia Canberra, New South Wales AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL ART Art Gallery of Western Australia Perth, Western Australia middle east FAITH-DORIAN AND MARTIN WRIGHT GALLERY OF AFRICAN ART Israel Museum Jerusalem, Israel ACERVO AFRICANO E AFRO-BRASILEIRO Museu de Arqueologia e Ethnologia Sao Paulo, Brazil autumn 1999 - african arts dialogue Continuedfrom page 9 ly disappearing. Again, I agree with him but not with the inferences he draws. The "classi- cal" arts of Africa do not simply disappear. In the Upper Guinea Coast area where we both work, the wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone have been devastating but have not eradicated the men's and women's societies or their arts. Not all "the young have spent the last decade riding around with assault rifles on the backs of pickups torturing old people and mutilating women and children." Lamp knows as well as anyone that although rebellion and violence between elders and youth have many prece- dents in the region, they have not yet erased the institutions that support much of the cul- tural production. At other times, "classical" forms are appropriated into contemporary media, just as new forms (e.g., colonial coins and Islamic charms on Bondo/Sande masks) find their way into the "classics." This raises my final question. How, in the end, do we draw a line between "contempo- rary" and "classical" arts in Africa? I was sur- prised to find myself lumped into the "contemporary" camp. Not only is my re- search village based and long term, it also focuses on objects and practices that, as far as I am able to tell, were very much the same in the precolonial era. I have never been interest- ed in classifying my work in this way, and it seems that in regard to the very important points Lamp raises, the desire to divide research into such categories is part of the problem, not the solution. 7 Mike McGovern Oyafero, Guinea Ph.D. Program, Graduate Institute of Liberal Arts Emory University, Atlanta REVIEW OF THE VISUAL ARTS OF AFRICA The Authors Respond We wish to thank Barbara Frank for her thoughtful review of The Visual Arts of Africa: Gender, Power and Life Cycle Rituals (Spring 1999, p. 14). We echo her criticisms of some aspects of the book, especially the printing errors (which were introduced after we re- viewed the final page proofs) as well as the too dark reproduction of several photographs. After we recommended corrections for the next printing, a stock of revised copies became available in the fall of 1998. (Unfortunately the publisher did not provide the later version for review.) The most significant change was made in chapter 2, where three of Anita Glaze's Senufo field photographs were substituted for figures 2.21, 2.23, and 2.24. We selected the three broad-based major themes of gender, power, and life-cycle rituals to help focus our discussion of a vast amount of visual material from the African continent. While we attempted to develop these themes when they were integral to the material pre- sented, we chose not to force them when they were not. Regarding our lack of coverage of North Africa and the absence of a discussion of con- temporary artists for all the major geographical regions, we had to decide whether to include these topics, thereby postponing publication by another year, or exclude them and aim for a publication deadline that would allow the book to be available for fall 1997 classes. Obviously we chose the latter option. As we begin to work on the second edition of The Visual Arts of Africa, we plan to incorporate a section on North Africa, expand the discussion of contemporary artists, and divide the coverage of East and South Africa into two chapters.

After the years at Jubilee, Legae's sculpture became more abstract both physically and conceptually, and his graphic work tended toward detailed naturalism combined with a highly intellectu- al use of composition and montage. His draw- ings often made use of large areas of open space and dense networks of line in chalk, pencil, and pen, with bony and sinewy forms floating out from massive black linear tangles. Characteristic of his work since the late 1970s was the motif of sacrificial animals and beasts of burden in horribly contorted postures: noble horses, wily goats, mangy dogs. In 1977-78 Legae began a poignant series of drawings protesting the brutal murder of activist Steven Biko. At their premiere at the Goodman Gallery, these images of crucified, crushed, and confined sacrificial fowl became known as the "Chicken Series." The related series, "Freedom Is Dead," contains more diverse iconography- skulls, insects, birds of prey; it won an honorable mention at the 1979 Valparaiso Biennale. Later pen-and-ink work includes images of what Legae considered to be the "real Africa" (a refer- ence to the sort of cultural freedom denied Black South Africans until recent years), which he had witnessed on a trip to Senegal. Other recent work reflects upon the state of South African pol- itics and society after Apartheid-particularly the psychological difficulties of transition to a multiracial democracy and the persistence of poverty and economic Apartheid.
