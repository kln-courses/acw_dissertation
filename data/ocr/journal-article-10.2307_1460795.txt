<plain_text><page sequence="1">Retrenchments in Religious Thought: Christian Parabolic Theology, Post-Christian Poetic Para-Theology* DANIEL C. NOEL T is no news by now that we are in a time of radical retrenchment for Western religious thought, the relation between faith's immediacies and their interpretive elaboration in theology having become seriously strained. Many writers in the modern period have been distressed by the "failure to fit" here, the mismatch of lived experience with the categories we have inherited for reflecting upon it. This well-documented dilemma has meant for some people the shedding of the religious traditions of their fathers and a search for more suitable concepts elsewhere, often in secular ideologies. Others have been led in frustration toward an anti-intellectualism which eschews all categories of interpretation whatsoever. But such hermeneutical shiftings and shoppings - Peter Berger's marketplace analogy for explaining the effects of pluralism comes to mind - have further required that even the assumption of unblurred boundaries separating the religious and secular, the theological and anti-theological, can hardly be held with great certainty any longer. The best theologians know all this, of course. They know it as a vocational identity crisis which propels them out of former doctrinal allegiances, into pre- theological confession and revisionist reflection. Or else, if they are somehow able to remain identified with a traditional Western communion and continue to do theology within that circle, they find the apologetic ante constantly upped: defending the faith virtually demands redefining it year by year. In this extremity, religious thinkers inside and outside of traditional theological circles are turning back toward forms of expression and conceptualization which lie "behind" theology as conventionally construed, closer to its sources in the lived experience of faith. *A comparative essay-review of the following: Speaking in Parables: A Study of Metaphor and Theology, by SALLIE TESELLE, Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1975, 186 pages, $4.25, L.C.

NOEL For Sallie TeSelle, theo-logos, "God-talk," is truly and properly a "speaking in parables," as the title of her provocative new book has it. Theology can and should at least be a speaking ofparables, an activity which serves its purpose by staying in touch with the primary forms of utterance in the New Testament and subsequent Christian genres. Without denying the value of what has been achieved by systematic theology of the dominant analytic-discursive variety, TeSelle champions an alternative mode: what Stanley Hopper has been calling theo- poiesis, a poetic and imaginal sensitivity to the implications of the divine Word in contemporary language, belief, and life. By applying the researches of Ernst Cassirer, Owen Barfield, Paul Ricoeur, and others on the nature of metaphor to the interpretation of Jesus' parables, and then by exploring the metaphoric operations of poetry, narrative, and autobiography in Christian history, TeSelle makes a convincing case. Her label for this level of religious reflection, midway between systematic theology and the parables themselves, is "intermediary" or "parabolic" theology. The major difficulties with her prolegomenon, it seems to me, are brought about by the same problematic of retrenchment, the same modernist agenda, which gives rise to it in the first place. Hers is a resolutely Christian theology, a fact which lies behind her frequent references to the purpose of theology as the serving of the hearing and acceptance of God's word in all times. This definition in turn exerts a strong, though unacknowledged, conservative pull on her thought which runs counter to her avowed intention to theologize without fearing "secularity, hiddenness, ironic distance, and indirection in the experience of coming to belief" (p. 141). Just such a risk-laden style of theology is dictated both by her metaphoric model and by what she allows is a desperate apologetic situation. Throughout the book, however, there are indications that she is held back from acting on these imperatives. Although she emphasizes "coming to belief" as a process forever preserved from stasis by the "story" quality of Christian discourse, she herself seems finally and fixedly to have arrived at belief. For instance, in a discussion of the parable form she asserts, with Robert Funk, Amos Wilder, and other New Testament scholars, that the voice of Jesus can have no special authority outside of its parabolic mediation. "It is only," she says, "by giving extraordinary attention to the parables themselves that we hear that voice and understand that vision" (p. 74). But surely this would imply that, in an important sense, we do not and cannot come to the parables as already settled Christian believers. And it would therefore suggest the dubiousness of formulas such as the following: "A parable of Jesus ... is a call to decision issued from one who is himself a parable, or, as Christians believe, the parable of God" (p. 78). How can there be Christians with such definitive beliefs about Jesus when his own parables are said to prohibit non-metaphoric closure? Rather than seeing this as a shortcoming of TeSelle's argumentation, I take it that such tautological tangles are built into the state of affairs all religious thought faces these days. Nevertheless, the question arises whether she has assumed a syllogistic progress, a discursive headway, through these knotty problems which none of us can now make. "Believing," she reasons, "comes out of experience, out of one's story: Christian believing sees in the story of Jesus the metaphor of all believing, a life developing toward its consummation in death still believing that the ultimate power is worthy of trust" (p. 85). Again: for there to be a "Christian believing"</page><page sequence="3">RETRENCHMENTS IN RELIGIOUS THOUGHT 781 secure enough to see Jesus as the single authoritative paradigm there has to be a non-parabolically authoritative Jesus to begin with, a firm foothold for faith outside of his story or ours. Privileged, unmediated access to the truth of Christianity, however, is exactly what TeSelle's reliance on the metaphoric imagination withholds. Although her chapter on narrative is called "The Story: Coming to Belief," coming to Christian belief is a story which Speaking in Parables presupposes rather than tells. Perhaps we need to take TeSelle's footnoted advice to return to the first chapter of her earlier Literature and the Christian Life (New Haven, 1971) for clarification on this question, but here, on her own terms, she appears to apply the designation "Christian" - and, a fortiori, "anonymous Christian" - too confidently. As a result, her latest book tends not to take the non-Christian seriously enough. This is demonstrated when she fails to follow up a parenthetical aside she makes while rejoicing over the accomplishments of certain novelists. She refers to the latter as offering "unusually rich resources for the theologian in understanding what it means, in contemporary terms, to create metaphors of coming (or failing to come) to belief"' (p. 141). Those who are failing to come to belief, or who came and went, represent another problem for TeSelle. What she considers to be secular or non-Christian in poetry, for example, has either already been safely categorized as Christian (Donne's "Holy Sonnet 5," Hopkins' "The Windhover," the pop preachments of folk hymns, Jesus Christ Superstar, and Corita Kent) or comes with clear non-Christian affiliations (Denise Levertov's Hasidism, Gary Snyder's Buddhism, Charles Olson's "special view of history") which her over-confident pigeonholing - she calls these three poets "cousins to Christians" (p. 117) - scarcely respects. Her desire, she says, is to give the disbeliever "sufficient 'space"' (p. 114). But she is manifestly driven toward "baptizing" the best of the disbelieving poets and storytellers. By the same token, someone who makes a strong point of rejecting Christian belief and who has not so far achieved any large eminence as a writer serves TeSelle's theological purpose as an inviting target. Such, at any rate, seems to be true of her animus against Sam Keen, whose death-of-God affirmations and autobiographical fragments constitute for her a crucial instance of wrong-headed religious hermeneutics. She does express the worry that her choice of Keen's book for analysis "is perhaps arbitrary and unfair" (p. 169), but quickly decides that his is so non-parabolic a confession (no stronger condemnation can be imagined) as to be "irresistible" (p. 170). Her criticisms of Keen are, it must be admitted, well taken. To a Dancing God is in many respects self-centered, romantic, even elitist, as she points out, and Keen's need to explain his story of the peach-seed monkey does take away from its metaphoric power. But on the other hand one presumes his book was only a beginning, an initial movement out from the self to the world which tried, haltingly, to be the sort of parabolic theology TeSelle calls for (albeit Keen's purposes are post-Christian and the intellectual domain he now occupies might better be described as "para-theology"). Besides, Keen's appeal to the category of story as a model for religious reflection at least has the virtue of taking that category itself as a metaphor: a possible, rather than obligatory, means of making sense of one's experience in time. This approach stands in sharp contrast to the essay TeSelle draws upon uncritically at several points, Stephen Crites' "The Narrative Quality of</page><page sequence="4">782 DANIEL C. NOEL Experience," which can be defensibly caricatured as a "proof for the existence of story." (Cf. Journal of the American Academy of Religion 39 [September 1971], pp. 291-311.) Although Crites supports his literalizing position with impressive argumentation and Augustinian resourcefulness, it is worth noting that he confronts strong counter-evidence - e.g., the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis or the non-narrative possibilities of a "post-modern" consciousness - no more fully than TeSelle deals with her disbelievers. Early on in Speaking in Parables the author confesses that "for many of us the language of the Christian tradition is no longer authoritative; no longer revelatory; no longer metaphorical; no longer meaningful. .... When this happens, it means that theological reflection is faced with an enormous task - the task of embodying it anew. This will not happen, I believe, through systematic theology ..." (p. 23). TeSelle is surely correct in this last belief, and if she is sometimes pulled back by the enormity of the task into an unseemly dogmatism, those of us who are engaged in related tasks should not be too critical. "Understanding the creative imagination as that which uniquely allows us to see and say the conceptually imperceivable and inexpressible" (p. 24) may be a challenge beyond the "negative capability" of any religious thinker, non-Christian or Christian. At all events, given Sallie TeSelle's calling and her Christian convictions about the purpose of theologizing, she has produced a comprehensive, lucid, and thoroughly persuasive statement of the need for a parabolic theology. II A second volume which approaches these same dilemmas from a quite different direction is Adalaide Kirby Morris' Wallace Stevens: Imagination and Faith. While reading these two excellent works I found myself augmenting TeSelle's treatment of disbelievers with the example of Wallace Stevens, while also injecting TeSelle's data on new developments in theology and biblical hermeneutics into Adalaide Morris' literary discussion. This experience informed my assessment of Speaking in Parables and will occasion some comparative comments in my dealings with the Morris book. An immediate impression gained from reading this study of Stevens is that his critique of the Christianity he knew was "radical" in the same sense that our recent "radical theology" was so called. Instead of another brittle attempt to demonstrate the non-existence of God, we were presented by that movement with a historical fait accompli: sincerely, sympathetically, but with utter finality, the once-living God was said to have "died." So with Stevens' pronouncements. Morris states that "the Christian religion was for Stevens an example of a Supreme Fiction which had fully accounted for reality and fully satisfied the imagination. One of Stevens' very late poems begins, 'St, Armorer's church was once an immense success'" (pp. 43-44). But the Christianity of his Lutheran forebears, Stevens felt, no longer sufficed for twentieth-century spiritual needs. As Morris continues, Stevens believed that "only in evolving beyond Christianity can we liberate the increasingly human self ..." (p. 66). The author agrees with J. Hillis Miller that the "'vanishing of the gods'. .. 'is the basis of all Stevens' thought and poetry' " (p. 46). And while she also accepts Ralph J. Mills' opinion that in Stevens' case "'Christianity is simply observed in retrospect'" (p. 47), she adds that if, "in death, the Judeo-Christian God is already a statue, .. . Stevens' critique of Christianity is his attempt to blow up that statue" (p. 50).</page><page sequence="5">RETRENCHMENTS IN RELIGIOUS THOUGHT 783 Whether the evolution of Christian theology itself, the twentieth-century re- visionings of its Tillichs and TeSelles, can be said to have kept pace with Stevens' experience is a question Morris does not go into. Hers is, after all, a volume in the Princeton Essays in Literature Series, and she no doubt desires it to pass muster before the ranks of the Stevens critics - not only Miller and Mills but also Harold Bloom and Helen Vendler and Joseph Riddel. This is, overall, a scholarly company not notably patient with thematic insistences on the "religious quest" in a poet's work, and its approval of Morris' reading of Stevens is an ample agenda for her energies. Still, she has, by her particular focus on Stevens' search for a substitute faith, implicitly entered the contemporary theological arena. Ideally, some sensitivity to the struggles within that arena would have made her study even stronger. As it is, she enables us to see Stevens' own lack of acquaintance with the theology of his day and his distrust of the Christian thought of the past: "Perhaps because he found Christian formulations obviously irrelevant, perhaps because he doubted his competence in theological argument, perhaps because he considered the Christian creed more an outmoded aesthetic projection than a serious object of belief, Stevens rarely seemed to notice Christian dogma itself" (pp. 50-51). In discussing a poem which condemns the theology of Aquinas, Morris points out that for Stevens a system like Thomism "is not of interest for the familiar reason that it is a structure of ideas no longer relevant to the structure of things, because it is self-contained or, in the poem's metaphors, because it is moonlight without the milkman" (p. 83). Significantly enough, when seen with Sallie TeSelle's concerns in mind, Stevens' separation from systematic theology takes on a religious-hermeneutical validity which Morris' exclusively literary perspective is not designed to disclose. Although TeSelle would be hard-pressed to call Stevens an anonymous Christian, as a theologian she shares with him the intention to put the milkman back into the moonlight, and would therefore very likely affirm many of his criticisms of traditional Christian thought. But none of this does much justice to the thing Morris' book brings out so well, that Stevens' critical jibes are balanced by a life-long attempt to construct, through his poetry, positive alternatives to each facet of the rejected religious past. At one point Morris touches on the Nietzschean character of the program of substitutions Stevens undertook: "For each end there is a beginning: if God is dead, modern man must recognize and facilitate a new order and era of belief" (p. 47). This suggests the sweep of Stevens' constructive program, but for a closer view it will be helpful to sample each of Morris' four long chapters in turn. The first one, "Lineage and Language: Stevens' Religious Heritage," deals with the poet's adaptation of biblical forms familiar to him from the piety of his great-grandfather, John Zeller: the parable, the proverb, the prayer, the hymn, and the psalm. Since TeSelle's book places such weight on parables, I want to look at Morris' discussion of that discursive form in particular. Morris' initial definition of the parable is disappointingly conventional; she calls it "a brief narrative from which a moral can be drawn" (p. 18). This has none of the emphasis of TeSelle's New Testament scholars on parables as extended metaphors capable of interpreting the hearer, surprising him or her with the challenge of fresh vision and altered lifestyle. Nevertheless, as Morris follows out Stevens' use of this form we find that in many respects his is an implicitly</page><page sequence="6">784 DANIEL C. NOEL metaphoric understanding of parables. She declares, for example, that "as a result of its structure, the parable is what Stevens terms one of the 'effects of analogy.' It demands the pondering of parallels" (p. 19). We can also infer a metaphoric core in Stevens' parables from what Morris says about his penchant for anecdote, "a sly twist of the parable": "dealing with such things as firecats, the red prince Berserk, and the huge canna in the dreams of X, they cannot be mistaken for fact but are parables as they might be told on the frontier: fictions posing, through Stevens' sleight-of-hand, as fact" (p. 23). To recall a passage from TeSelle's own chapter on the parable form, "as genuine metaphors, parables could not do other than turn us toward reality, for, as Wallace Stevens says, the purpose of 'the symbolic language of metamorphosis' is to intensify one's sense of reality" (p. 70). Stevens' anecdotal parables, then, may be said to employ metaphoric means to intensify our sense of reality in a time when reality is happening at the disputed frontier between fact and fiction. Morris concludes that Stevens' "transvaluations" of parables and other biblical genres "defer to the supreme integrations of the old by retaining the vocabulary and purpose; they acknowledge new realities by changing the content" (p. 32). Morris charts much the same transvaluative process in her second chapter, "The Deaf-Mute Church and the Chapel of Breath." She explains that for Stevens the Church had become a "deaf-mute" because it was "unable to sense the new realities, unable to voice the old integrations" (p. 45). Her reference to Stevens' projected alternative is, in turn, couched in imagery which introduces his central substitution of the imagination for God. "The chapel of breath which must, in the death of religion, replace the deaf-mute church is the church of the spirit and the temple of imagination. It is a return from created object to creating force, from the -concept of God, which is 'only one of the things of the imagination,' to imagination itself" (pp. 80-81). Chapter Three, as seen from its title, "Mystical Theology: Stevens' Poetic Trinity," is taken up in part with exploring the ramifications of Stevens' transvalued "doctrine of God." But Morris first shows how Stevens' aims imply that "modern poetry must incorporate theology" so that the latter becomes "a 'theology after breakfast,' one which 'sticks to the eye': a theology improved by poetry's stubborn adherence to the ordinary world" (p. 83). This again coheres with many of TeSelle's intentions for parabolic theology, while at the same time being aligned with Sam Keen's post-Christian and para-theological direction. Certainly the sense of a "poetic trinity" in Stevens' work suggests the presence of Christian thought-forms, but Morris indicates how their content has, once more, been altered. The "three persons" of the imagination are the deified source, its incarnation in the hero - Stevens' "major man" -,, and its immanence as an indwelling presence in the world. Stevens' ponderings of the God-term in his para-theology are especially intriguing, since the notion of the imagination as creative power seems to deliver him over to the same dilemmas generations of Christian thinkers and their critics have wrestled with. Chief among these is the tension between transcendence and immanence, between an alien abstractness, immune to our projections but unavailable for worship, and an anthropomorphic deity all too pathetically human. Stevens' way of working this out is Feuerbachian. "'The anthropomorphic can only yield in the end to anthropos ...'" (pp. 100-01), he decided, and Morris goes on to say that "specifically, God yields to the quality in man which made God: the imaginative, the fictive power which, like beauty, is</page><page sequence="7">RETRENCHMENTS IN RELIGIOUS THOUGHT 785 eternal in the flesh. The imagination is not a projection of itself by a race of egoists but the power by which we conceive the universe as a thing apart: it is 'the music summoned by the birth/That separates us from the wind and sea"' (p. 101). The idea, so comfortable to our Western sensibility since Freud yet so dubious when universalized, that there is some quality of human potential which "made God," is one Stevens eventually perceived as incomplete. Morris quotes his more considered judgment that the poet's imagination "'is not wholly his own but ... may be part of a much larger, much more potent imagination, which it is his affiar to try to get at'" (p. 113). He tried to get at it by adumbrating, through his poems, a kind of ethic. As Morris tells us in her final chapter, "How to Live, What to Do," Stevens held the Arnoldian conviction that poetry must provide "a sanction for life and an idea of order to sustain us" (p. 136). Viewed from the standpoint of these concerns, his poetry becomes what Ralph J. Mills has termed "a personal church," while the transcendent-immanent dichotomy in the doctrine of the imagination appears as a spiritual-factual "doubleness" in central Stevensian images such as the rock, the angel, and the earthly paradise. Morris says of the rock, once a symbol of the truth revealed through the Christian church, that "if 'it is a mountain halfway green' to symbolize the empirically tangible, the definite, and the factual, it has another 'immeasurable half, such rock/As placid air becomes' to symbolize the intangible, indefinite, mystical element man brings to the rock: the light of imagination" (pp. 138-39). Likewise, Stevens' image of "the necessary angel of earth" is further described as "'the angel of reality': he brings contact with the actual of earth and he represents 'the imagination, the one reality/In this imagined world.' The 'reality' figured by the angel, like the 'truth' figured by the rock, is both spiritual and factual" (p. 153). Finally, Morris discusses the theme of the "mystic marriage" in Stevens' work, and we are led to the symbol she considers a climax of Stevens' poetic transvaluations: ". .. in the peace of this mutual fulfillment earth becomes, for a moment long as midsummer, Stevens' paradise: 'Axis of everything, green's apogee / / And happiest folk-land, mostly marriage-hymns'" (p. 175). The imagery of meetings and matings is necessary to Stevens' paradisiacal earth because, as Morris stresses, "the land we live in ... is neither wholly of the earth nor wholly of the mind but an infinitely, intricately variable creation of the 'identities/ Between one's self and the weather'" (p. 176). But also necessary for this midsummer reconciliation of doubleness is the "credence" of the late poem "Credences of Summer," Stevens' "consummate hymn to the paradise of living, finally and fully, as and where we live" (p. 183). And so we are back to the question of belief, but from Stevens' post-Christian perspective "final belief," as an earlier poem states it, "Must be in a fiction." This "nicer knowledge of/ Belief, that what it believes in is not true" - to use a formulation from "The Pure Good of Theory" - is enough, in images like the rock, the angel, and paradise, to provide "a consoling, perfecting illusion, a fiction in which we can, if only for a moment, believe, and a fiction through which we again touch earth" (p. 153). Whether graciously given or painstakingly achieved (traditional tensions persist in this regard), Stevens' "certain faith that 'the brilliance of earth is the brilliance of every paradise'" (p. 181) was in any case a fleeting certainty, and embraced as such. This is a key point to be made here, for it means that Stevens' story was not a "coming to belief" in TeSelle's terms.</page><page sequence="8">786 DANIEL C. NOEL While the Stevens Morris' study presents is at times tantalizingly close to TeSelle's ideal of the parabolic theologian, and is seemingly separated from it only by a lack of contact with the live options of recent Christian thought, it is important to see that the differences between Stevens' aims and TeSelle's are still determinative. Indeed, TeSelle might want to offer a stern critique of the Stevensian piety and para-theology Morris illuminates. Another thing to remember is that although Louis Martz has written thoughtfully of Stevens' adaptation of Christian meditative forms which go back to Hopkins and Donne (poets whom TeSelle, as we have noted, enlists in her cause), probably no exclusively literary analysis has given us so religiously post-Christian a Stevens as Morris' book. Her approach is to some extent a deductive amassing of examples to support a pre-existent thesis, and there is small attention paid to the kind of poem-by-poem explication some other Stevens critics have employed to highlight a totally unreligious oeuvre. If, in other words, we decide that Morris corroborates Robert Bellah's remark in Beyond Belief that Stevens is "the greatest American 'theological poet' of the twentieth century" - and I am persuaded that she does - we are nonetheless compelled to see Stevens as closer to the struggles of a Sam Keen than to the respected Christian "intermediary" thinkers William Lynch and Richard R. Niebuhr, who provide TeSelle with her major intellectual role-models. We are also obliged to use ungainly labels like "post-Christian" and "para-theology" in order carefully to differentiate Stevens from the parabolic theology with which his poetry and poetics instructively overlap. III Although each of these two books stands on its own as a valuable work revelatory of contemporary retrenchments in religious thought, each can also be a lens for perceiving unnoticed or unexploited riches in and through the other. Alone or together, they can hardly be expected to clear up in any definitive way the confusion at the borders of belief today. Our experience itself seems to have evolved to where it is out of reach of even the most forward-looking schemes and strategies for conceptual demarcation. We need perhaps to abide for a time in the ambiguities of Stevens' poems or TeSelle's sort of parables - including stories uniquely expressive of women's experiences of coming (or failing to come) to belief - before presuming to build ambitious new systems of religious theory. But of course that is precisely the message, or part of it, that both women bring. However conceptually couched, their appeal is to aesthetic as over against the prevailing scientific paradigms of intelligibility. This should contribute not only to a long-overdue acceptance of artists as serious religious thinkers in and through their art, but also to a related re-appraisal of the "and" in "Religion and Literature."</page></plain_text>
