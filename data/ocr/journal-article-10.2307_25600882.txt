<plain_text><page sequence="1">STEVEN E. COLE The Logic of Personhood: Coleridge and the Social Production of Agency GIVEN THE CENTRALITY WHICH COLERIDGE HIMSELF accorded tO his theory of the reason1 and his conception of personhood, the virtual absence of these topics from most commentary is noteworthy.2 This is not to say that the subjects are not mentioned, but rather that they serve only rarely as the focus of any sustained discussion. The reasons for this are complex, having to do both with methodological questions about how literary critics customarily deal with philosophical issues, and the oretical questions about what is significant in Coleridge's thought. These two sorts of questions obviously influence each other: the theoretical assumption that Coleridge is most significant in his discussion of the imagination produces in turn a style of criticism or interpretation whose aim is to show either the success or failure of imagination as a mode of apprehension.3 But whatever the origin of the problem, the consequence i. Despite Coleridge's own usage, I use the lower case for both reason and understanding in order to avoid the ontological implications which are smuggled in with capitalization. 2. Standard discussions of Coleridge's theory of the reason include Charles Richards Sanders, Coleridge and the Broad Church Movement (1942; New York: Russell &amp; Russell, 1972) 19-43; Arthur O. Lovejoy, "Coleridge and Kant's Two Worlds," in Essays in the History of Ideas (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1948) 254-76; Thomas McFarland, Coleridge and the Pantheist Tradition (London: Oxford UP, 1969) 215-16; and Owen Barfield, What Coleridge Thought (Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan UP, 1971) 105-9. 3. The most significant examples of this style of criticism are deconstructive readings of Coleridge which uniformly rely on a belief that Coleridge's theory of the imagination (and more generally of the reason) is designed to defend an idealist or transcendental ontology which can be deconstructed (with almost comical simplicity) by showing how such a position fails to account for empirical contingencies. See Jean-Pierre Mileur, Vision and Revision: Coleridge's Art of Immanence (Berkeley: U of California P, 1982); Arden Reed, Romantic Weather: The Climates of Coleridge and Baudelaire (Hanover, N.H.: UP of New England, 1983); and Jerome Christensen, Coleridge's Blessed Machine of Language (Ithaca: Cornell UP, 1981), and "The Mind at Ocean: The Impropriety of Coleridge's Literary SiR, 30 (Spring 1991) 85</page><page sequence="2">86 STEVEN E. COLE has been a seriously truncated version of Coleridge which is in part responsible for the glibness with which his thinking is dismissed by contemporary theory.4 In what follows, my argument is that Coleridge's construal of reason and personal identity, far from being reducible to the "romantic ideol ogy" of the transcendent self, is in fact a complexly argued defense of agency as a shared construal of identity. My claim is not, however, that this position is "offered" in any simple way, nor even that the position is not contradicted by equally plausible analyses of Coleridge. Rather, what I want to show is that Coleridge's thought about these issues rewards precisely the kind of serious attention that we so readily grant to Kant or Hegel, yet which seems somehow so alien to a "literary" figure such as Coleridge. Coleridge believed himself to be a philosopher, and in part my claim will be that by treating him as such?by examining not so much his beliefs as his arguments?we begin to find a carefully nuanced response to issues of agency and belief which is far more subtle and compelling than contemporary accounts have been willing to grant. I Until quite recently, the faculty psychology upon which any theory of reason is assumed to be based was largely held in contempt, and despite Life," in Romanticism and Language, ed. Arden Reed (Ithaca: Cornell UP, 1984). There are good defenses of the philosophical coherence of Coleridge's conception of the imagination in Timothy Corrigan, Coleridge, Language, and Criticism (Athens, Georgia: U of Georgia P, 1982), and Paul Hamilton, Coleridge's Poetics (Stanford: Stanford UP, 1983). I have argued for the coherence of Coleridge's understanding of language in "Coleridge, Lan guage and the Production of Agency," Modern Philology 88 (1990): 109-125. 4. In a recent collection of essays, Politics and Poetic Value, ed. Robert von Hallberg (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1987), politically engaged poetry is seen by Anne McClintock as a "refusal to see poetry in the Coleridgean sense" (243) and by Jerome McGann as refusing to "propose for its immediate object pleasure, as Coleridge once said all poetry does" (312). These examples are indicative of a widespread tendency to use Coleridge, and more generally romanticism, as a foil for what is claimed to be the overcoming or decentering of the unified self which the romantics are assumed to privilege. A classic example of this kind of argument is Ralph Dollimore's claim, in Radical Tragedy: Religion, Ideology and Power in the Drama of Shakespeare and His Contemporaries (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1984), that Coleridge saw "the individual ... as a transcendent subject constituted ... by an essence in its own right" (261). The belief that the "romantic self" is the product of ideological delusions is central to the New Historicist arguments in Jerome McGann, The Romantic Ideology: A Critical Investigation (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1983), and Social Values and Poetic Acts: The Historical fudgment of Literary Work (Cam bridge: Harvard UP, 1988), and Clifford Siskin, The Historicity of Romantic Discourse (New York: Oxford UP, 1988).

Thus, Jon athan Bennett concludes a sympathetic and incisive account of Kant's theory of knowledge by virtually dismissing the relevance of the reason to that theory: I believe that Kant had no moderately clear view about the putative faculty of reason. We shall probably get closest to his usual working picture if we assign to the understanding the sorts of conceptualizing which are needed for survival in the real world?cavemen's theo rizing, as it were?and associate reason with intellectuals' theoriz ing, i.e. the deliberate and explicit search for relatively high-level explanatory theory in order to give one's corpus of belief more unity than the man in the street needs for his mundane practical purposes.6 There are two problems which philosophers such as Bennett see in traditional descriptions of reason, although the problems are really two versions of the same complaint. First, it is argued that our knowledge of the world, even when it is not deducible from our experience of the world, does not require the hypothesis of a transcendental realm as the ground of that knowledge. Such a hypothesis, the argument goes, is merely a terminological substitution which begs the more vexing ques tion of how the relationship of knowledge to its objects is to be con strued. The second objection is that the theory of reason, insofar as it purports to be a descriptive psychology, involves an unwarranted meta physics which would attempt to single out from the vast array of dispositions manifested by any agent a special class of dispositions which is claimed to be independent of experience. In both cases, what is being argued is that the theory of reason wants to find an unconditioned ground for both empirical and psychological experience, and that such an attempt must invariably fail to account for the heteronymous conditions which compose the empirical and the psychological. These complaints are, of course, not new, but what distinguishes analyses of Coleridge from, say, those of Kant or Hegel, is the failure to find explanatory frameworks which might change the 5- See Noam Chomsky, Reflections on Language (New York: Pantheon, 1975) and Jerry Fodor, Modularity of Mind (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1983).

COLE focus of discussion from purely logical questions about the putative ontology of reason, to functional questions about what the theory of reason is supposed to be able to explain. Further, while philosophers such as Bennett have found much that remains defensible after the theory of reason has been shed, literary critics have instead assumed that the very belief in reason necessitates an incoherence or even duplicity about such issues as the relationship of agency to experience. To put it bluntly, the scepticism which underlies contemporary theory has made it im possible even to consider whether there is anything of worth in positions such as Coleridge's which deny the central tenets of scepticism. A good starting point for examining problems in this dismissal of Coleridge's theory of reason and his account of agency is the following passage, which has been widely cited in contemporary criticism: no natural thing or act can be called originant, or be truly said to have an origin in any other. The moment we assume an origin in nature, a true beginning, an actual first?that moment we rise above nature, and are compelled to assume a supernatural power.7 7- The Complete Works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, ed. W. G. T. Shedd, 7 vols. (New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1871) 1: 272-73; hereafter cited as CW. Coleridge's insistence that the entities of nature cannot be conceived as originant is consonant with Kant's almost nightmarish vision of a world where consciousness is overwhelmed by the objects of its experience: If among the appearances which present themselves to us, there were so great a variety?I do not say in form, for in that respect the appearances might resemble one another; but in content, that is, in the manifoldness of the existing entities? that even the acutest human understanding could never by comparison of them detect the slightest similarity (a possibility which is quite conceivable), the logical law of genera would have no sort of standing; we should not even have the concept of a genus, or indeed any other universal concept; and the understanding itself, which has to do solely with such concepts, would be non-existent. If, therefore, the logical principle of genera is to be applied to nature (by which I understand those objects only which are given to us), it presupposes a transcendental principle (Im manuel Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, trans. Norman Kemp Smith [New York: St. Martin's, 1965] A 653-54). Coleridge's effort at understanding what we might call the psychology of Kant's "transcen dental principle" is, as has often been noted, part of the more general effort at bridging the austerity of Kant's distinction between consciousness and things in themselves, but we fail to understand Coleridge's place in this effort if we assume, as for example, Lovejoy does in "Coleridge and Kant's Two Worlds" (n. 2 above), that Coleridge leaves untouched the distinction of the noumenal and the phenomenal.

Beiser, The Fate of Reason: German Philosophy from Kant to Fichte (Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1987)</page><page sequence="5">COLERIDGE AND THE SOCIAL PRODUCTION OF AGENCY 89 This distinction between nature and origin appears to involve precisely the sort of confusion about the relationship of agency to empirical temporality that recent theoreticians have argued is evidence that the very notion of agency is hopelessly confused. Indeed, the sceptical (or deconstructive) reading of such an argument is fairly obvious. An origin would be that from which the reality of a thing might be determined: in the absence of origins, things have no relation to each other (or rather, the relations of things to each other are infinite, and thus non-existent), and thus the existence of any particular thing is purely contingent. Accordingly, since nature (which Coleridge defines as "a power subject to the law of continuity . . . which law the human understanding . . . can conceive only under the form of cause and effect . . . but for which the term reciprocal action, or the law of reciprocity . . . would be more accurate and more expressive" [CW i: 272]) provides no origins (the entities composing nature being defined purely reciprocally, in terms not of what they are but rather in terms of what they are not), self definition can itself be seen to have a purely private, and thus indeter minate, origin. To try to fix the definition of a self requires establishing a non-reciprocal relation of a self to its origin, but if origins are them selves not to be found in the public or shared domain of "nature" (nothing in Coleridge's definition of nature allows restricting the term to non-human objects, since from the present perspective, any externally perceived object, whether human or not, can be defined only recipro cally, that is to say as part of "nature"), then our definition of the self, of agency, must accordingly be indeterminate. In other words, if what originates agency is agency itself, then no determination of what con stitutes or defines agency can be made. A way out of this dilemma might be to claim that agency is produced noumenally, and thus is independent of the endless reciprocal relations of nature, an argument which would work only if the noumenal were itself independent of the agency it produces. But if this were true, then it would be impossible to understand how agency could ever know the conditions of its production; while from the perspective of the nou menal, agency might genuinely be seen to have an origin, such an origin must remain forever inaccessible to agency itself, so long as agency remains in any way part of the phenomenal world of reciprocal relations. An additional problem is this: the noumenal as an origin for agency may prove coherent from the perspective of my own agency, in that I can posit a noumenal origin for those aspects of my identity which seem not explained by my phenomenal experience if such an origin seems the necessary ground for precisely those inexplicable aspects. But I am in no way entitled to posit a similar ground for other agents, since all my</page><page sequence="6">90 STEVEN E. COLE knowledge of them is derived phenomenally. (Indeed, a standard argu ment for behaviorism is that the belief that behavior is privately origi nated involves an unwarranted reification of one's private experience at the expense of what one knows, phenomenally, to be the case for other agents.8) Thus, if the power to originate behavior is the sole defining characteristic of agency, then agency must itself, as the sceptic has argued, be construed either privately or as divinely produced. (The sceptic would of course feel that showing that an origin in divinity is the sole alternative to privacy is a compelling argument for privacy.) Coleridge's most significant difference from the deconstructive view proposed here is over the question of whether agency can be understood to exist prior to its manifestations. For Coleridge, the claim that agency can be understood in this way involves a failure to distinguish between that which motivates an action, and that which constitutes an action, which in turn involves a failure to understand the nature of action itself. An action, for Coleridge, seems to be that behavior for which one can postulate an origin, but the origins of actions must themselves be divided into what E. J. Bond calls "internal" and "external" determinants, the former being the psychological mechanism for choice (however it is defined), and the latter being the reasons for the choices that are made.9 Accordingly what produces an action is its twofold origination: an action is both motivated by a decision to act in a certain way, and constituted by the reasons for the decision. In thus tying private motivation to consti tutive reasons, and in further arguing that agency is produced by the relation between these two, Coleridge provides an account of agency which is able to incorporate both the public or determinate, and the private or indeterminate, aspects of agency.10 In order to show how this Coleridgean position challenges the scep tical argument, I want to begin by examining the private or indeter 8. See Stephen Stich, From Folk Psychology to Cognitive Science: The Case Against Belief (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1983) 221-46. 9. E. J. Bond, Reason and Value (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1983) 13-15. See also Bernard Williams, "Internal and External Reasons," in Rational Action: Studies in Philosophy and Social Science, ed. R. Harrison (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1979) 17-28. 10. There is an ongoing debate about whether desires can coherently be claimed to be the reason for actions. The Coleridgean position I am defending here would want to argue that while desire is trivially necessary for action (in the sense that I will not act without wanting to act), the question of motivation is empty without a clear sense of the external (or teleological) reasons for what I want. What determines my actions is not my desire but rather the ends which constitute the reason for my desire. Coleridge believes that we can speak coherently about morality only if desires are tied to reasons in this way. For a similar argument (although one pointed at a consequentialism that Coleridge would reject), see Derek Parfit, Reasons and Person (Oxford: Oxford UP, 1986) 120-27.</page><page sequence="7">COLERIDGE AND THE SOCIAL PRODUCTION OF AGENCY 91 minate aspect of agency, which is that part of agency which involves an internal decision to act in a certain way. Coleridge's name for this aspect of agency is the "will," and his position demands that his definition of the will show that the will is itself not determined by some prior object. For if the will does have such a prior determination, then it cannot be seen as part of that which originates actions, and accordingly the dis tinction between agent-produced actions and the endlessly proliferating reciprocal relations of nature must be abandoned. Here is Coleridge's distinction between nature and the will: Nature is a line in constant and continuous evolution. Its beginning is lost in the supernatural: and for our understanding therefore it must appear as a continuous line without beginning or end. But where there is no discontinuity there can be no origination, and every appearance of origination in nature is but a shadow of our own casting. It is a reflection from our own will or spirit. Herein, indeed, the will consists. This is the essential character by which Will is opposed to Nature, as spirit, and raised above nature as self determining spirit?this namely, that it is a power of originating an act or state. (CW i: 272) Unfortunately, in this form, the will seems completely indeterminate, in that its sole difference from nature is the absence of a causal relation. What Coleridge needs, to tighten his definition, is an explanation of what it means to originate an act, and to do this he distinguishes between an experience for which one can find something "analogous to it in outward experiences" and an experience which "belongs exclusively to the will" (CW 1: 273). In the former case, what produces the experience is an external phenomenon over which one has no control, while in the latter case, the experience itself would not have occurred in the absence of an internal decision. But Coleridge goes beyond this fairly prosaic definition of the will by extending his position in two ways. First, he insists that the will be understood not as an independent metaphysical entity, but rather as something whose presence is known by its mani festation: "we know what will is by acting" (CW 1: 273). In other words, the will is defined as a kind of relation we have to our experiences, a relation which Coleridge calls "acting." What matters, then, is how we construe the kinds of experiences we have; insofar as there are experi ences which seem not to have "analogies" in the external world, which seem not, that is, to have an external causation, then we are justified in attributing those experiences to the will. Second, Coleridge argues that our understanding of the will be tied to our acknowledgement of what Coleridge calls "the main contra-distinctive character of humanity . . .</page><page sequence="8">92 STEVEN E. COLE that distinction between things and persons on which our whole moral and criminal law is grounded" (CW i: 273). In the absence of a belief that things and persons can be distinguished, Coleridge implies that our identification of the will as that which originates actions will be unable to counter the claim that our belief in the will is "an illusion arising from our ignorance of the antecedent causes" (CW 1: 273). In other words, it is only in the context of rational purposes for our actions (such as the purpose of treating others as persons rather than things), and further, of those purposes being manifested in actions, that it makes sense to speak of the will at all. But before examining more closely Coleridge's analysis of rational purpose, we need first to look at how Coleridge conceives the relation ship of the individual will to the will of God. In the argument we have been considering, Coleridge seems to believe that the denial of the will cannot be reconciled with "the belief of an all-wise Creator" (CW 1: 273). But while Coleridge feels that the lack of such reconciliation itself argues for the will, his argument to this point does not demand that we see the will as dependent upon the existence of God. Later, however, Coleridge makes this dependency quite explicit: A finite will constitutes a true beginning; but with regard to the series of motions and changes by which the free act is manifested and made effectual, the finite will gives a beginning only by coin cidence with that Absolute Will, which is at the same time Infinite Power. Such is the language of religion, and of philosophy too in the last instance. (CW 1: 274) It is difficult to know exactly what this means, particularly since Coler idge provides no arguments for his position. The problem is that the distinction between will and nature, which was perfectly coherent on its own terms, has now changed to a distinction between finite and absolute wills, the latter of which is claimed to be the necessary ground of a "free act." If Coleridge is here restricting the definition of a "free act" to those acts which are in harmony with divine will, then his argument is a rather uninteresting tautology which has no bearing on the earlier definition of the will. On the other hand, if Coleridge wants to make the stronger argument that "coincidence with that Absolute Will" is itself the precondition of the freedom of the finite will, then what he has done is turn the finite will, in its relation to divinity, into precisely the same sort of thing that nature is in relation to the finite will: both are intrinsically nothing more than contingent entities with no real beginning or end.11 11. Thomas McFarland, in his defense of what he calls Coleridge's "Trinitarian reso</page><page sequence="9">COLERIDGE AND THE SOCIAL PRODUCTION OF AGENCY 93 A way out of the difficulty would be to distinguish between infinite and finite freedom, and to argue that the latter is not dependent on the former. Coleridge himself seems to grant that such a position is con ceivable when he says "a finite will does indeed originate an act, and may originate a state of being; yet only in and for the agent himself" (CW i: 274), the distinction here presumably being what purpose an act serves: a finite will cannot by itself originate an act for God, and accord ingly is not free from a religious perspective, although it may very well be free from a finite perspective. That Coleridge is uncomfortable with the implications of his argument is indicated by his claim that "the will of a finite agent acts outwardly by confluence with the laws of nature" (CW 1: 274), thus abandoning the distinction between nature and will which had allowed the initial definition of the will. However, nothing in his argument requires that we accept this. II Thus far, the focus has been what we might call the motivational side of agency, that is, that aspect of agency which is internal. Further, we have seen that it is only the finite will which can explain how an agent might act independently of both the laws of nature and divine will. What we now need to examine is the constitutive side of agency, that is, the external reasons for an agent acting in a certain way. Following Kant, Coleridge locates such external reasons in the reason itself, and the primary thrust of his account of agency is to show how the internal decisions of the will can be located in the external determinations of the reason. What is important here is that the notion of free agency does lution, " argues that Coleridge is coherent in grounding the finite will in the absolute, but such coherence is purchased at the cost of understanding Coleridge's claims about finite agency, a cost which Coleridge himself seems more than willing to pay. See McFarland, Coleridge and the Pantheist Tradition 191-255. McFarland's defense of Coleridge on this issue is supported by James D. Boulger, Coleridge as a Religious Thinker (New Haven: Yale UP, 1961), and J. Robert Barth, S.J., Coleridge and Christian Doctrine (Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1969). It is natural that defenders of Christian theology would find nothing incoherent in Coleridge's attempt at collapsing the finite into the absolute, but what is worth noting is that this position requires that Coleridgean beliefs which are perfectly defensible from the perspective of the finite, but which contradict the privileging of the absolute, must themselves be seen as incoherent or anomalous. The ambivalence which orthodox Chris tians have felt towards Coleridge's contradictory merging of the finite and the infinite goes back to the 19th century, as we can see from Newman's claim that Coleridge "indulged a liberty of speculations, which no Christian can tolerate, and advocated con clusions which were more often heathen than Christian, yet after all installed a higher philosophy into inquiring minds, than they had hitherto been accustomed to accept" (John Henry Cardinal Newman, Apologia Pro Vita Sua, ed. David J. DeLaura [New York: W. W. Norton, 1968] 84.).</page><page sequence="10">94 STEVEN E. COLE not at all involve a specious belief in pure origination, that is, a belief that agency is free only if its actions are independent of any possible determining force or context. Rather, the definition of free agency that Coleridge is advancing assumes that "freedom" denotes a kind of rela tionship that agency has (or can have) to the contexts which constitute the very possibility of agency itself. In other words, while the relation ship of the will to reason is constitutive of the possibility of agency itself, that relationship can itself be seen as free, in that it originates in the will's decision to pursue the ends of reason, or determinate, in that it originates in the will's passive acceptance of externally produced ends. Thus, Coleridge's argument is not that all the actions originated by the will are determined by the reason, by rational purposes, but rather that it is the existence of rational purposes which provides our ability to discriminate among kinds of actions. Further, while the will is the necessary precondition of action, by its very freedom from external causation (a freedom which leads Coleridge occasionally to mistakenly associate the will exclusively with the reason12) the will can originate experiences which are indistinguishable from the contingencies of the external world in their passive acceptance of the external world. In other words, the passivity or activity of the will is determined not by the nature of the will itself, but rather by the origin of the choices which the will makes, an origin which itself becomes the determinant of one's identity: 'the Reason in finite Beings is not the Will'?or how could the Will be ever opposed to the Reason? Yet it is the condition, the sine qua non of a free i.e. of actual Will. Therefore Reason and the Will are the co-efficients of actual personality.13 From this perspective, what the reason offers the will is a ground of identity from which personality can be actualized. In the absence of such a ground, it becomes coherent to claim that the will is choosing not to be free, in the sense that what it is choosing produces a kind of identity which is the antithesis of freedom. The choice of an unfree identity (the choice of an identity from within which choice is inconceivable) is thus for Coleridge the choice to have one's identity determined by the con tingencies which he argues are the province of the understanding. 12. See, for example, CW i: 192-98. See Barth, Coleridge and Christian Doctrine 107-12, for an argument that the identification of the will with the reason is a coherent extension of the claim that the finite will must be located in the absolute. 13. Quoted in Boulger, Coleridge as a Religious Thinker 233.</page><page sequence="11">COLERIDGE AND THE SOCIAL PRODUCTION OF AGENCY 95 But in order to make sense of such an argument, we need first to examine whether the reason and understanding are defined in such a way that it remains coherent to speak of "choice" at all. A good starting point is Coleridge's distinction between the theoretical and practical versions of the difference between the reason and the understanding,14 a distinction which begins with a description of the reason as a potential awareness of totality: The Reason first manifests itself in man by the tendency to the comprehension of all as one. We can neither rest in an infinite that is not at the same time a whole, nor in a whole that is not infinite. Hence the natural Man is always in a state either of resistance or of captivity to the understanding and the fancy, which cannot represent totality without limit: and he either loses the one in the striving after the infinite (i.e. Atheism with or without polytheism), or the infinite in the striving after the one (i.e. anthropomorphic mon otheism) .15 Obviously, the consequence Coleridge draws here from "captivity to the Understanding" is exclusively theological, in that such captivity produces either "atheism" or "anthropomorphic monotheism," but what is interesting is that these results come from an ontological awareness, and are not in any sense the consequences of actions. Further, these modes of representation cannot themselves be seen to originate in the will, since their origin is quite explicitly either the purely external (that represented by the understanding) or the purely universal (that repre sented by the reason); in neither case can the will be distinguished as an entity with the power to initiate choice. Coleridge goes on to argue (in a footnote) that "in order compare the Reason . . . and the Understand ing . . . we must distinguish each according to its twofold character . . .?i.e. th?orie or intellective, and moral or practical" (LS 60), but as we shall now see, his elaboration of this distinction does nothing to explain how the will, as the originating force of actions, can be conceded any real existence from the perspective of an ontological universality. He argues that from a theoretical perspective, the Reason is "the contemplation of immediate truths [he also calls these "self-evident"]? or the immediate recognition of the Necessary and the Universal in 14- While Coleridge is obviously indebted to Kant for the distinction between theoretical and practical conceptions of the reason, his extension of this distinction to the understand ing seems to be his own. 15.

COLE negative and positive positions," while the Understanding is "the power of generalizing the motives of the Sense, and of judging of the objective reality of all Appearances by their reducibility to a genus or class" (LS 60). Both of these definitions imply that the reason and the understand ing *arc- faculties possessed by an agent, as his further description of the understanding as "the faculty of mediate truths" (LS 60-61) clearly in dicates. However, if we extend the present definition of reason in the direction of what I want to call the "ascending" reason (that is, the reason as the embodiment of a universally necessary totality) and if we similarly extend the definition of the understanding in the direction of the "descending" understanding (that is, the understanding as the em bodiment of contingent particulars whose sole existence comes from endlessly proliferating reciprocal relations) what we find is that the reason itself becomes the totality of that which is real, and the under standing slips away into a maze of illusion.16 Now it may well be that such a position is ontologically defensible, but it allows no conclusions to be drawn about the status of individual agency, since such agency itself, insofar as it is humanly instantiated, must either be illusory, or be universally determined: in either case, no distinction among kinds of agency, such as is required for the very definition of agency as originated by the will, can be made. No similar difficulties plague the practical distinction between the reason and the understanding, if we examine the distinction in isolation i6. In an analysis of what he calls "the pure position of the thing," Coleridge argues that "all apparent separation (the being m and not 1 or n) must fall under the one or the other of two modes of Relation," the first of these being "the Relations of all to each beheld as in God," and the second of these being "the Relations of Finites to Finites, which may be divided into Phaenomena &amp; their solutions." The first of these perceives relations "as all would appear from an eye commensurate with the Universe if placed in the center of the Universe ... an Infinity that is at the same time absolute Unity?and of that therefore, in which the center contains the circumference. " The second mode of relation, apparently limited by its restriction to "finites, " is incapable of seeing the center as itself inseparable from that which surrounds it, and instead perceives what are implied to be causal rela tionships between an initial phenomenon (Coleridge's example is the sun rising) and its explanation, its "Solution," in "the appearances that would present themselves from the center of the particular System, in which the first appearance takes place (See Collected Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, ed. E. L. Griggs, 6 vols. [Oxford: Oxford UP, 1956 71], iv: 689-90). The distinction between the finite and the infinite (which are here synonymous with the understanding and the reason) indicates the degree to which Coler idge's ontology requires that the understanding be conceived as descending to a world of phenomena whose relations are purely arbitrary, and that the reason be conceived as ascending to a realm of absolute unity within which all relations, by virtue of their internal necessity, are conceivable only from the point of view of omnipotence.</page><page sequence="13">COLERIDGE AND THE SOCIAL PRODUCTION OF AGENCY 97 from the ontological position: the reason is "the power of determining the Will by Ideas, as Ultimate Ends," while the understanding is "the faculty of selecting and adapting means to proximate ends?i.e. such ends as in their turn become means" (LS 61). ("Power" and "faculty" seem to be functionally equivalent, although there is a deliberate bias towards the reason in describing its use as a "power.") Unfortunately, Coleridge immediately again mixes the ontological and the psychological in ar guing that "reason, in the highest sense of the term, as the focal point of the Theorie and Practical, or as both in One, is the source of Ideas and conversely, an Idea is a self-affirming Truth at once Theorie and Practical, which the Reason presents to itself, as a form of itself.?For the Understanding, an Idea can be only described negatively?as that it is super-sensuous, ideal [ideas] in opposition to eidola [appearances]" (LS 61). The obvious problem here is that nothing in Coleridge's description of the will as that which motivates individual agents allows the will to have access to the "super-sensuous," and yet the claim that reason itself is manifested as a "self-affirming Truth at once th?orie and practical" demands such access, if the reason is to be seen as that which determines the will. What we need, then, is a better explanation than Coleridge offers here of how the reason can be said to determine the will, and to do this, we should examine what the force of "determine" is meant to be. From our earlier examination of the will, it should be clear that "determine" can not mean either that the reason creates the will, or that the reason establishes determinant limits on what the will can do: in either case, it would no longer be coherent to speak of the will as originating behavior. Rather, what I think Coleridge wants to say is that the reason determines the will in the sense that it provides a motivation, a determination, for the will to act in a certain way.17 But we can still save a stronger meaning for "determines" if we understand that from this what the reason is providing is a formulation of practices the participation in which the will is free to originate. Accordingly, everything depends upon how we define the ultimate ends upon which the reason bases its determination of the will. One way to begin such a definition is to consider what Coleridge means when he contrasts ultimate ends with "proximate ends?i.e. such ends as in their turn become means" (LS 61). The difference seems to 17- For interesting discussions of how reason can provide a motivation for action, see Alan Gewirth, Reason and Morality (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1977) 190-98, and Bond, Reason and Value 27-41.</page><page sequence="14">98 STEVEN E. COLE rest upon both the way that a particular end is defined, and on the kind of action which is produced by pursuing an end. If an end is defined as "proximate," then its existence has only a contingent relation to other ends, in the sense that one pursues it not for itself but rather for that to which it is contingent. Accordingly, acts motivated solely by the pursuit of proximate ends will be purposeless in the sense that the achievement of the end will itself have accomplished nothing. At this level of abstrac tion, it is perhaps difficult to imagine what it would be like to act in such a way, since intuitively all actions seem motivated by ends whose achievement makes the actions themselves worth doing. But as we shall see, the distinction between proximate and ultimate ends is quite coher ent insofar as it designates contradictory relations which the will might have to practices in which it engages. Accordingly, let us consider ultimate ends as distinguished from prox imate ends by the kinds of practices which they constitute. Most ob viously, if our pursuit of proximate ends produces actions largely devoid of purpose, then our pursuit of ultimate ends should have the opposite effect?it should produce actions whose defining characteristic is their purposefulness. In other words, the distinction between kinds of ends is instantiated by the kinds of actions which the will's pursuit of those ends produces, and in this sense it is fair to conclude that the kinds of ends an agent pursues determines the kind of person he or she is; the pursuit of proximate ends produces a passive, and finally merely con tingent agent, while the pursuit of ultimate ends produces an active, and thus self-defining, agent.18 I have so far spoken, however, as if the particular ends pursued were themselves a matter of indifference, and indeed, Coleridge seems at times to assume that it is the definition of an end as "ultimate, " and not the particular end itself, that is at stake in the distinction between kinds of ends. But if the pursuit of an end is itself the defining characteristic of the kind of agent one is, then we can see that the particular ends that one pursues (and not merely the kinds of ends) need themselves to be 18. "Self-definition" is tricky here. If the end a self pursues is a purely private matter, then Coleridge's position is vulnerable to precisely the deconstructive critique offered above. But, as I hope I show below, for Coleridge, privately determined ends contradict completely the shared definition of agency which is the starting point of the pursuit of ends. Anya Taylor, in a recent study, Coleridge's Defense of the Human (Columbus: Ohio State UP, 1986), fails to understand Coleridge's contextual definition of personhood, and the result is a defense of a Coleridge who "would like to think he was centered, not displaced into margins" (68), which merely perpetuates the easy oppositions upon which deconstruction relies.</page><page sequence="15">COLERIDGE AND THE SOCIAL PRODUCTION OF AGENCY 99 judged according to their adequacy in constituting the sort of person we want to be. In other words, an ultimate end is constitutive of a practice the participation in which constitutes our identity as an agent, and accordingly, an ultimate end can be said to have constitutive or intrinsic value: while our pursuit of an ultimate end may be contingent in terms of our choice as to whether the end should be pursued, once we choose to engage in such a pursuit the value of the end is itself intrinsic in that it alone provides the reasons for our pursuit. This doesn't mean that we can't choose from among varying constitutive ends, but rather that our reasons for the choice will come from the end itself, from the powers of self-construction which the end enables. HI The fundamental idea of reason (its ultimate end) for Coleridge is the idea of the person as distinguished from the thing, and by insisting that personhood is an idea, rather than a pre-existing state, Coleridge wants to establish that being a person is constituted by the pursuit of an end, as opposed to being an essential quality of the human itself: personhood is a relation a human can have to an end, just as being a thing is what a human becomes in the absence of such a relation. What is crucial to determine here is what produces the ends which are constitutive of our identity as persons, for if such ends are privately produced, then the earlier claim that ends are embodied in the practices which they consti tute becomes nonsense: a privately produced end would be indistin guishable from the originating capacity of the will itself, and as such, could not have the constitutive force necessary to determine the will. At times Coleridge writes as though the ends of reason were indeed privately produced, although he would certainly not want to believe that this is the consequence of his arguments. In a note appended to The Friend, he draws a distinction between the theoretical and the practical reason, in a way which initially may seem to parallel the discussion at which we have already looked: "[metaphysics] has for its province Acts and Constructions of the free Intellect, and might be named the Science of Self-construction: while [mathematics] has for its department the acts and constructions of the necessary Imagination."19 But what is new here is the quite explicit association of freedom with what Coleridge had earlier called the practical reason, that is, the reason as that which determines the will by ultimate ends. But while in the earlier formulation such ends 19- Samuel T. Coleridge, The Friend, ed. Barbara E. Rooke, 2 vols.

COLE had seemed at least in principle to be determinant, and thus beyond the realm of free choice, the association here of freedom and "Self-construc tion" makes it difficult to understand how the ends could themselves be determinant. One possible way out of this dilemma would be to argue that the freedom of self-construction here is just the freedom to have actions be determined by ultimate ends which are themselves independent of free dom itself. But Coleridge elsewhere makes this resolution seem far too simple, by arguing that in those areas to be determined by the reason, the determining principles are themselves a matter of choice: "all such subjects as are out of the sphere of the senses, and therefore incapable of a direct proof from outward experience . . . will be decided by each individual according to the positions assumed as first principles in the metaphysical system which he had previously adopted" (LS 104-5). Nowhere does Coleridge formulate more clearly the difficulties intrinsic in attempting to provide an ontological description of agency. Since the very definition of agency requires the hypothesis of will, the hypothesis, that is, of the power of choice, the theory of agency must acknowledge the capacity of an agent to choose principles whose coherence and deter mining force are purely private. If, as Coleridge implies in these arguments, self-construction is com pletely a matter of choice, one of two consequences follows. Either the construction of a self is a purely contingent and arbitrary process, at least as it is understood from the perspective of other selves, or the very construction of a self must involve the determining force of principles whose existence must be independent of the self, even though their determination of a particular self is a product of choice. It is, of course, the latter position which Coleridge wants to argue, and for the position to be persuasive, it must confront two related issues. It must first explain what the principles are which determine a self insofar as its process of construction is aimed at producing a self. (It is perfectly plausible to imagine a process of self-construction whose aim is to destroy the possibility of being a self, if one distinguishes between a self as that which originates the process and a self as that which is produced by the process.) Second, the position must explain what the consequences are if the choice is made not to construct a self, which here would mean choosing not to have one's self determined by the principles of reason. This latter issue is vital, because if no consequences followed from the kinds of choices being made, then it would become impossible to argue for choosing to have one's self determined by the principles of reason, and accordingly, self-construction would indeed have to be seen as a purely private and indeterminate process.</page><page sequence="17">COLERIDGE AND THE SOCIAL PRODUCTION OF AGENCY 101 As I have already mentioned, Coleridge argues that the most signifi cant principle governing self-construction, the most significant end con stituting the possibility of being a self, is the idea of a person as distin guished from a thing. Obviously, Coleridge's insistence on this distinction is by no means original, nor is it completely persuasive, as the following formulation should indicate: Every man is born with the faculty of Reason: and whatever is without it, is not a man or person, but a thing. Hence the sacred principle, recognized by all Laws, human and divine, the principle indeed, which is the ground- work of all law and justice, that a person can never become a thing, not be treated as such without wrong. But the distinction between person and thing consists herein, that the latter may rightfully be used, altogether and merely, as a means; but the former must always be included in the end, and form a part of the final cause. We plant the tree and we cut it down, we breed the sheep and we kill it, wholly as means, to our own ends. The wood-cutter and the hind are likewise employed as means, but on an agreement of reciprocal advantage, which includes them as well as their employer in the end. (Friend i: 189?90) There are two difficulties in this formulation which stop the distinc tion of persons and things from having the force which Coleridge wants it to have.20 First, the claim that others be treated as persons rather than things presupposes the very existence of personhood which the distinc tion between persons and things was itself designed to explain. To state the distinction merely in terms of one's obligations to others does noth ing to help elucidate why such an obligation exists, since it is only if one's own personhood is that which has incurred an obligation to others which allows the claim that one has an obligation to others as persons. In the absence of such reciprocity, the possibility that I am myself a thing, that I am merely the means to the ends of others, precludes any claim that I must necessarily regard others as persons. What is needed, rather than a presumption of personhood from which obligations can be deduced, is an explanation of how personhood is itself constituted by first, the capacity to recognize others as agents capable of having their behavior motivated by ends, and second, the belief that others are similarly capable of recognizing my own motivation by ends rather than 20. My discussion of the difficulty of distinguishing persons and things draws upon Robert Paul Wolff, The Autonomy of Reason: A Commentary on Kant's 'Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals' (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1973) 42-68.</page><page sequence="18">102 STEVEN E. COLE means. Only such a reciprocal definition of personhood can explain why the very definition of personhood involves an obligation to treat others as persons. This leads to the second difficulty in Coleridge's position here, which is the vacuity of his example of what it means to act from means rather than ends. The distinction he wants to draw between how one treats a tree and how one treats a wood-cutter seems to rest solely on the claim that in the latter situation, my treatment of the wood-cutter cannot violate the ends which he has posed for himself. But what's difficult to understand here is what limits there are on my obligation to the wood cutter; surely Coleridge cannot mean that my relations to the wood cutter are defined solely by his ends, yet nothing in the example can explain what the proper action is when ends conflict. Unfortunately, the very example Coleridge gives of treating others as persons rather than things involves an assumption that ends are themselves privately pro duced (I am asked to respect whatever ends the wood-cutter has pro posed for himself) and that the recognition of others as persons is thus only a second-order reflection upon my relations to others, which log ically comes after my determination of my own ends. For if this is not the implication of Coleridge's argument, then the example produces the incongruous situation that my own relation to the wood-cutter is de termined by his ends, while his relation to me is also determined by his ends: nothing in the example explains how the idea of personhood might affect the wood-cutter's ends, and in turn how my own recognition of (and obligation to) his ends might change if the context of recognition were thus transformed. What we can now see is that the mere distinction between persons and things as that which constitutes personhood avoids the question of context, the question, that is of where it makes sense to locate the intersubjective constitution of personhood that we have seen is missing in the example above. If we locate it purely in the relations of isolated individuals, many of the same problems emerge that we saw earlier in the claim that personhood is privately produced: just as the private definition failed in its inability to account for my identity in relation to other agents, so what we might call the inter subjective definition fails if it cannot account for the totality of my relations to the world, includ ing the reciprocal relations I have to other agents. For if the defining characteristics of personhood are first, the capacity to act out of ends, and second, the contradistinction to being a thing, then just insofar as there remain aspects of my experience (such as the ends which constitute the experience of others) which do not manifest these characteristics, there remains also my failure to act as a person.</page><page sequence="19">COLERIDGE AND THE SOCIAL PRODUCTION OF AGENCY 103 We need to explore, then, both the contexts which define my relations to other agents qua agents, and also, the larger contexts, whether public or private, which are themselves defining of these more narrowly con ceived forms of relations. For if the distinction between persons and things cannot account for such contexts, then inevitably, at some level, my claim to be acting out of those ends which are constitutive of my own personhood must be illusory; as long as there remain aspects of my experience in which either I regard others as things rather than persons (my relations to them are determined, that is, not by their own ends but rather by the ways which I can use them), or in which I am myself regarded as a thing rather than a person (and thus am incapable of acting out of ends which I have freely chosen), then my own status as a person is itself impossible to maintain. Presumably, this line of argument is a version of the claim that the ultimate ends of reason must be universal, but what is different is the recognition that such univer sality must be understood not ontologically but contextually: an end can be claimed to be ultimate, to have a universal validity, only if its exis tence, in all possible contexts, allows me to act out of ends.21 Or, to put this point somewhat differently, if contexts exist within which I can plausibly act in ways which are counter to the idea of being a person, without that idea itself being placed in jeopardy as the constitutive power in my sense of my self, then the choice between acting according to ends and acting according to means is effectively irrelevant since neither of the possible choices has any real relation to my construction of who I am. Coleridge wants to claim that the idea of personhood has such uni versality, and what I now want to do is examine whether he provides the necessary contextual explanation which would lead us to grant such a claim. If the idea of personhood is able to constitute contexts within which my own personhood is necessarily acknowledged, then it be comes coherent to speak both of the universality or ultimacy of the idea itself, and also to claim that insofar as the idea is contextually instantiated (instantiated, that is, in the practices through which it is known) one can speak of my obligation to others. 21. The insistence on both social and temporal contexts as necessarily part of my identity as a person is central to Derek Parfit's rejection of "nearness" as a criterion for motivation. (The nearness criterion would argue that we have reasons to want only those things which are either socially or temporally near to us. For example, the nearness criterion argues that it is rational to want a present satisfaction over a future satisfaction, or to want to aid the lives of those I know over the lives of those I don't know.) See Parfit, Reasons and Persons 117-95.</page><page sequence="20">104 STEVEN E. COLE IV In "The Essay on Faith," Coleridge offers his fullest, and most com pelling, explanation of how the idea of personhood is contextually en acted, how it allows a shared recognition, and constitution, of my capacity to act from ends.22 What Coleridge wants, in this essay, is to provide an analysis of the generation of faith, which he assumes requires an explanation, not of the theological maxims which are the object of religious faith, but rather of the logically prior constitution of person hood, our faith in which allows the description of more specific kinds of faith. Thus, while Coleridge's aim in the essay is certainly to establish what he feels is the necessity of faith in God, the form which his argument takes by no means requires that we follow him to this con clusion. Rather, our focus will be on the specific relation Coleridge wants to establish between faith in our own personhood, and the con texts which establish our awareness of that personhood. Coleridge begins the essay with a definition of faith which seems to rely on precisely the ontological assumptions which I have earlier criti cized: "Faith may be defined, as fidelity to our own being?so far as such being is not and can not become an object of the senses . . . and again to whatever is affirmed or understood as the condition or concom itant, or consequence of the same" (CW v: 557). What is important here, however, is not an ontological distinction, but rather a contrast between two ways of understanding who we are: insofar as our being is determined in such a way that it is indistinguishable from objects of sense qua objects of sense, then it is not really a being which we "own"? it is not, that is, a being to which we can have a relation of faith. That Coleridge can not mean the contrast of our being to all sensorily per ceived objects is obvious from his example of his definition of faith: "That I am conscious of something within me peremptorily command ing me to do unto others as I would they should do unto me" (CW v: 557). Since no non-sensory awareness of others is possible, it is obvious that what Coleridge must mean by an "object of the senses" is those things which we perceive to which we have no obligation. Thus the fidelity which faith demands of us is a fidelity to our being insofar as that being itself incurs an obligation, insofar, that is, as our being is not something that can be treated with the indifference that one treats a sensorily perceived thing.23 22. This essay has attracted only limited discussion. The best analyses are McFarland, Coleridge and the Pantheist Tradition 235-38, and Barfield, What Coleridge Thought 163-64. The problems of dating the essay are examined by Barth, Coleridge and Christian Doctrine 29-30. 23. Coleridge's derivation of personhood from obligation can be usefully contrasted to</page><page sequence="21">COLERIDGE AND THE SOCIAL PRODUCTION OF AGENCY 105 But what Coleridge understands is that such a notion of obligation cannot be derived privately; it cannot come from a privately constituted idea of who we are. The reason for this is that if who we are is defined in isolation from the other objects of our experience, nothing warrants our belief that we are any different from any of those other objects, and if no such difference exists, then we can have no obligation to treat ourselves as anything other than a sensorily perceived object. Accord ingly, Coleridge's example of "fidelity to our own being" establishes a relation our being has to the being of others, and the burden of his essay is thus to show how that relation can constitute a self to which we can be claimed to have an obligation.24 Coleridge begins by defining conscience (the awareness of an obligation) as one's consciousness that in so far as doing unto others as I would have them do unto me is a defining attribute of my own personality, that consciousness itself presupposes a more general consciousness of the derivation of my individual identity as a person from the idea of per sonality as that which defines the human. In other words, Coleridge argues that in so far as one is a person, one has both a consciousness of personhood as incurring an obligation to treat others as one wants one's self to be treated, and a more general consciousness that such an obli gation derives not from one's individual identity, but rather from the dependence of that identity on a shared human identity; it is only this latter consciousness that permits the awareness of an obligation, the development of a conscience: in the very act of being conscious of [the command to do unto others as I would they should do unto me] in my own nature, I know that it is a fact of which all men either are or ought to be conscious;?a fact the ignorance of which constitutes either the non personality of the ignorant, or the guilt, in which latter case the Michael Tooley's definition of the person as the subject of "non-momentary interests." What Tooley wants is a definition of the person which would authorize a position of indifference towards those entities which are defined as non-persons, a position which has as its consequence a political quietism about the material conditions which enable the possession of "non-momentary" interests. (Tooley assumes that the only human candidates for personhood which would fail to possess "non-momentary interests" are fetuses and infants, but this assumption does not seem to follow from his argument.) Grounding personhood in obligation, as Coleridge wants to, prohibits precisely this sort of political quietism. See Michael Tooley, Abortion and Infanticide (Oxford: Oxford UP, 1983) 123 34. 24. See, on this point, Laurence S. Lockridge, Coleridge the Moralist (Ithaca: Cornell UP, x977) 159-60; Anthony John Harding, Coleridge and the Idea of Love (Cambridge: Cam bridge UP, 1974) 189-90; and Raimonda Modiano, Coleridge and the Concept of Nature (Tallahassee: Florida State UP, 1985) 73-77.</page><page sequence="22">106 STEVEN E. COLE ignorance is equivalent to knowledge wilfully darkened. I know that I possess this consciousness as a man, and not as Samuel Taylor Coleridge; hence knowing that consciousness of this fact is the root of all other consciousness, and the only practical contra-distinction of man from the brutes, we name it the conscience; by the natural absence or presumed presence of which, the law, both divine and human, determines whether X Y Z be a thing or a person. (CW v: 558) What Coleridge wants here is to define personhood as both an internal consciousness of an obligation to others, and an external consciousness of the derivation of that obligation from the shared human identity which the possession of such an obligation instantiates. From this per spective, it is obvious that when Coleridge speaks of "our own being" as opposed to an "object of the senses," what he means is that our own being is that which is determined by a relational interaction of our own consciousness and the consciousness of others, and that it is the deriv ation of our being from such a relation that allows the contradistinction to sensory objects. Further, when he argues that we have an obligation to our own being, an obligation which is defined, paradoxically, as an obligation which we have to other beings, what he means is that the very derivation of our being from our relations to other beings requires such an obligation. If I did not treat others as I want my self to be treated, the very constitution of my self by my relations to others would be impossible: my treatment of others is that which constitutes my own self. While this argument certainly provides a compelling explanation of why I would want my identity to be relationally constituted, in that it is only from within such a constitution that I can be certain of being treated as I would want to be treated, the explanation is by no means intended to offer an ontologically determinant account of who one is; it is determinant only with respect to being a person rather than a thing. The existence of the will insures that we can, if we want, choose to be a thing rather than a person, although the location of the reason itself in the idea of being a person makes it impossible that one could ever offer reasons for being a thing; in this sense, scepticism is not the offering of alternative modes of explaining who we are, but rather a denial of the possibility of explanation itself, a denial of the adequacy of the reasons which are given for choosing to act in a certain way.25 For crucially, 25- See Stanley Cavell, "Knowing and Acknowledging," in Must We Mean What We Say? (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1976) 238-66.</page><page sequence="23">COLERIDGE AND THE SOCIAL PRODUCTION OF AGENCY 107 Coleridge sees that a sceptical rejection of the obligations incurred by our consciousness of our constitutive relations to others is a rejection of the possibility of agency itself: In the senses we find our receptivity, and as far as our personal being is concerned, we are passive;?but in the fact of the conscience we are not only agents, but it is by this alone, that we know ourselves to be such. (CW v: 558) One implication of sensory passivity, of the denial of agency, is that experience itself becomes impossible, for Coleridge argues that it is only in the act of becoming conscious of one's conscience, of one's obligation of one's fealty to one's self and others, that it is possible to establish the relation of one's self to the external world which is the presupposition of the possibility of experience: "the initiation of the process, the be coming conscious of a conscience, partakes of the nature of an act. It is an act, in and by which we take upon ourselves an allegiance, and consequently the obligation of fealty" (CW v: 559). Another way of understanding this dependence of consciousness (which is here synonymous with experience) on conscience can be found by examining the meaning of the word itself: conscience, in this its simplest form, must be supposed in order to consciousness, that is, to human consciousness. Brutes may be and are scious [sic], but those beings only, who have an I, scire possunt hoc vel illud una cum scipsis [are able to know this or that together with themselves]; that is, conscire vel scire aliquid mecum [to be con scious, that is to know something with me], or to know a thing in relation to myself, and in the act of knowing myself as acted upon by that something. (CW v: 559) Here it is what we might call the "withness" of consciousness, the dependence of the scire in consciousness upon the con, which establishes the relation of the knower to that which is known and thus makes possible consciousness itself. In our experience of things, no such relation is necessary, and thus Coleridge uses the neologism "scious" to describe the kinds of experience which we have in common with animals, in so far as we are ourselves like animals. But we can be aware of being acted upon, and thus of knowing in relation to ourselves, only if that which is acting upon us has a similar awareness, since the very definition of act here is that which emerges out of consciousness. Accordingly, since it is only a person which has the capacity to act, to determine its experience by its consciousness, Coleridge believes that he has shown the dependence of consciousness upon conscience?the dependence, that</page><page sequence="24">108 STEVEN E. COLE is, of our consciousness on our awareness of an identity with that which we are conscious of, and a corresponding obligation of fealty to our awareness ofthat identity, a fealty which is constitutive of the possibility of the identity itself. Finally, since this relation of shared identity which is constitutive of my personhood is produced by an act, by a decision of the will to determine my identity by the idea of being a person, we can say that personhood is itself defined by participation in the very practices through which it is known, and accordingly that its sole on tological force is its constitution of those very practices. What Coleridge leaves free is our decision as to whether to have our will determined by the idea of being a person, but he assumes that such a decision will itself be motivated by our awareness that it is only through such a decision that we can come to be treated as a person rather than a thing, that we can act rather than simply be acted upon. But this abstract description of the logical form of the relations con stituting personhood leaves open the question of where the shared iden tity that constitutes our personhood is to be located. One possible answer is to locate it solely in our relations to isolated others, to find, for example, in romantic love the sole constitution of our identity as per sons.26 But while Coleridge may at times lend credence to such a belief, in the "Essay on Faith" he is emphatic that the relations that are consti tutive of personhood must be universal, in the sense that they must account for all our possible relations to other agents. Coleridge admits that this argument is a "deep meditation" but he insists that "the position is capable of the strictest proof" (CW v: 559). The basis of his "proof" is an argument for the dependence of first person awareness, that is, an awareness determined by conscience, on all other possible construals of person. He begins by once more deriving the conscience from the will's decision to determine individual identity from its relations to others: Now the third person could never have been distinguished from the first but by means of the second. There can be no He without a previous Thou. Much less could an I exist for us, except as it exists during the suspension of the will, as in dreams; and the nature of brutes may best be understood, by conceiving them as somnam bulists . . . there can be no I without a Thou, and that a Thou is only possible by an equation in which I is taken as equal to Thou, and yet not the same. And this again is only possible by putting 26. Harding, Coleridge and the Idea of Love, finds in Coleridge's conception of love a "desire to escape the corruptions of an existing community by creating a smaller one" (266).</page><page sequence="25">COLERIDGE AND THE SOCIAL PRODUCTION OF AGENCY 109 them in opposition as correspondent opposites, or correlatives. In order to do this, a something must be affirmed in the one which is subjected in the other, and this something is the will. I do not will to consider myself as equal to myself, for in the very act of consti tuting myself /, I take it as the same, and therefore as incapable of comparison, that is, of any application of the will. If then, I minus the will be the thesis, Thou plus will must be the antithesis, but the equation of Thou with I, by means of a free act, negativing the sameness in order to establish the equality, is the definition of conscience. (CW v: 559)27 What the conscience recognizes is that my own identity can be secured only if there is that to which I am equal, for failing such a relation of equality the very notion of identity is itself inconceivable. We have already seen that the content of such equality for the conscience is the imperative to treat others as I would have them treat me, but here Coleridge wants to establish the logic of such equality. Thus he needs both to establish that in terms of which equality can be asserted, and that in terms of which difference can be maintained: both of these are necessary, since the very notion of equality requires both sameness and difference. The sameness he finds in the existence of the will in both "I" and "Thou" while the difference is in how the will functions. If the will asserted equality from the perspective of "I," the assertion would be hollow, since the very act of constituting an "I" must assume an internal identity of that which is constituted, which leaves the "I" incapable of being compared to itself: from this Coleridge concludes that the will cannot be applied to the "I" in terms of itself. (The will can, of course, be applied to agency conceived as a thing, that is, as passive, for in that case, the object of application as Coleridge defines it cannot be an "I.") Accordingly, what the will must be applied to is a "Thou" conceived as possessed of a will in relation to itself, for then both the sameness and the difference necessary for my constitution of an "I" are established: the "I" is the same as the "Thou" in its possession of a will, but it is different from the "Thou" in how its will functions. By using its will 27. As Thomas McFarland has pointed out, Coleridge's position here is similar to Martin Buber's analysis of I-Thou relationships (Coleridge and the Pantheist Tradition 236-39). But McFarland's claim that Coleridge differs from Buber in deriving "the I-Thou . . . from the nature of consciousness . . . one human confronting another as an I to a Thou, [which] for Coleridge [is] a secondary realization of a polarity that has arisen in the individual consciousness itself" (239) is contradicted by Coleridge's insistence that the I is itself constituted by the totality of its relations to others.</page><page sequence="26">110 STEVEN E. COLE to understand its relation to the will of the "Thou," the "I" is able to establish the very relation to equality which constitutes its own identity. But as Coleridge understands, what is being described here is not the ways that a specific agent would function, but rather the consequences that can be drawn from an agent, constituted as a person, as that agent is situated in the web of relations which constitutes its existence. Ac cordingly, the very qualities which contradistinguish an "I" from a "Thou" will be instantiated in the same agent as it occupies different relational positions. From this, it also follows that nothing allows the relations which constitute personhood to be limited to those identified in the relation of an "I" and a "Thou": Unlike a million of tigers, a million of men is very different from a million times one. Each man in a numerous society is not only coexistent with, but virtually organized into, the multitude of which he is an integral part. His idem is modified by the alter. And there arise impulses and objects from this synthesis of the alter et idem, myself and my neighbor. (CW v: 563) We can thus see that the idea of personhood instantiates not the private relations that one individual has to another, but rather the totality of relations an agent can potentially have to other agents, a totality from within which difference and equality are necessarily the defining char acteristics.28 More important, our participation in that totality is pro duced by a freely chosen act the terms of which are themselves consti tuted by the totality: what an act determined by personhood (as he defines act, Coleridge does not allow an act not determined by person hood) allows is a determination of my own identity, a determination 28. From this perspective, we can see that Stephen Bygrave over-emphasizes the scep tical relationship which the Coleridgean self has to the existence of others: The self which is an object evident to the consciousness meets the individual who is an object of admiration and desire or of fear and loathing. They recognize each other. It is a circle that Coleridge never breaks. He will detach himself from his own construction, be a spectator even of his own mooted community; and yet these very acts of detachment provide us with a language antagonistic to the closure they suggest. They provide a language that is exemplary but not ideal?sceptical, dia lectical, fragmentary. (Coleridge and the Self: Romantic Egotism [New York: St. Mar tin's, 1986] 199) For a more subtle analysis of scepticism in Coleridge, which argues in part that scepticism is for Coleridge (and for English romanticism in general) a means of escaping the privacy of identity bequeathed by Hume, see Andrew M. Cooper, Doubt and Identity in Romantic Poetry (New Haven: Yale UP, 1988) 23-25.</page><page sequence="27">COLERIDGE AND THE SOCIAL PRODUCTION OF AGENCY 111 which insures that I will myself be treated as a person rather than a thing. Coleridge is, however, acutely aware that a mere description of the constitution of personhood is vacuous if it does not address the material enactments of that constitution, the real institutions and practices which comprise our actual experience. Indeed, even in the "Essay on Faith," whose ultimate purpose is to vindicate our faith in a non-material, tran scendental ground for our identity as persons, he admits that the de scription of personhood he has offered requires the recognition that the scenes of our experience have a determining force which may work against the very idea of being a person: "Soon, however, experience comes into play. We learn that there are other impulses besides the dictates of conscience; that there are powers within us and without us ready to usurp the throne of conscience, and busy in tempting us to transfer our allegiance" (CW v: 560) Thus, it follows from Coleridge's argument that two directions are possible. Either we can move inward, exploring the psychological contexts relevant to my participation in shared practices which constitute my identity as a person, or we can move outward, to the historical and political contexts which serve as the scene of the process. In either case, what is at stake is a recognition of those forces which inhibit or obstruct my participation in shared, constitutive practices, and more important, a search for values which might help achieve those ends which psychological or historical forces seem to occlude. That such a position resembles closely the dilemmas with which contemporary criticism wrestles as it struggles to find a way out of the easy ironies of indeterminacy is no accident; indeed, my central argument here is that our rejection of Coleridge (and more generally of romanticism) is purchased in part at the cost of our own ironized futility.
