The following passage translated from the " Con- clusions " gives the gist of the book: " Incoordination rules in all animal so- cieties. Despite appearances, no member of the community works for it; each works alone, functioning from the influences which direct it, and inde- pendently of the results. Contrary to current affirmations the facts do not permit it to be said that the group constitutes a superior organism, possessed of special qualities. In reality all the individuals are caught in a mesh of in- teractions in which each of them takes a direct part, and the inter-attraction which unites them does not modify the nature of their relations.... From this point of view we conclude a strict individualism. And, in fact, each member behaves in no way differently than does a solitary animal" (p. 314- 15). The individual he defines as " a living body, anatomically isolated and functioning autonomously." The latter criterion is to be interpreted only after appreciation of the manifold relationships involved between any organ- ism and its biotic and physical environment. Non-social groupings include colonies, associations and crowds. The last also occurs in social groups which are characterized by internal integration through the cohesive force of inter- attraction. Three forms of reaction of animal to animal are noted (1) in- difference, (2) inter-repulsion, and (3) inter-attraction which is said to des- ignate a precise reaction of an organism to a determined excitation, on the order of sensorially oriented reflexes, or tropisms, and like them dependent on the physiological state of the animal and modifiable by external conditions which affect that state. The night aggregations of halictid bees are chosen to exemplify the rudimentary condition of social life. In stressing the " dis- interested" nature of the social phenomenon the author as urgently refuses advantages as other writers have claimed them. How is it more excusable to insist against, as for, a benefit? For example, the large web formed by the juxtaposition of smaller ones by the lycosid spider Araneus cornutifs is used as an illustration of the purity of the basic social force, because, it is claimed, such a web is a distinct disadvantage for it increases the number of spiders to feed upon the prey. The first three chapters treat of the matters mentioned above, and end with a remark on heterotypic societies. Inter-attraction is cited as the inte- gration of such groups as Corvus cornix and C. frugilegus, ants and myrme- cophiles, crabs and actinians. The reader is left to ponder how such a thing may come to pass between, for example, a crab and a coelenterate. The whole topic is confined to a three page discussion. 1 Rabaud, Etienne. 1937.

They can only be mentioned here: the whole being greater than the sum of its parts, collective manifestations (food provision, slave- making, etc.), division of labor and polymorphism, mutual aid, language, and the evolution of societies. The last will interest many. All efforts to evolve social life are deemed fruitless, for they repose on the assumption that the simple is the primitive. Behaviors distinguish the modalities of social life, but behavior is individual and is neither developed from or modified by such life. Behaviors developed in solitary forms may become social with the ac- quisition of inter-attraction by those animals. He recognizes, however, that social life does facilitate the continuance of variations, especially losses of abilities in what others called the more specialized members. In these chap- ters a method is used which gains the point for the author before the rebuttal is started. He presents a clean definition or statement of the problem, but in such rigid and anthropomorphic terms that rash indeed would be the person to contradict. One example suffices: " Provision implies foresight, foresight presupposes a knowledge of the sequence of events, which could scarcely be possessed by animals " (p. 170). A more striking case is found in the chap- ter on language which is concluded by the statement that a true language, however simple it may be, is entirely lacking (p. 231). Chapter IX consists of a recapitulation and an extension into human society which differs only by the presence of states of consciousness, their corollaries, and language. The reason for the book and the method of treatment of data are told in the preface. Comparative analyses are essential for results. Especially it is important to study the individual alone and with the group. Further the social and closely related solitary forms should be compared. Both anthropo- morphic interpretation and the setting apart of human society are deplored. He states that the essential is to remain constantly in contact with positive facts, and in preventing the addition of imaginary facts which engender error. It is necessary to avoid confounding interpretation resting on fact with f an- tastic hypothesis, which making a choice among the facts deforms them, and may direct research into channels providing inconsistent phantoms. The task which the author set himself is a very large one, and perhaps it is not sur- prising that he fell into this same pitfall to which he consigns the efforts of others. It is inevitable as long as the concept lacks the plasticity of living phenomena. However, the originality of the idea, the stress on the individ- ual, and the attempted objectivity make the book worth consideration, al- though the dogmatic tone will antagonize its readers.
