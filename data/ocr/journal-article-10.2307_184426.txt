<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILOSOPHY AND THIS WAR WALTER CERF INTRODUCTION: THE PURSUIT OF TRUTH Science has become independent of its possible applications and misapplica- tions to human welfare. In so far as the practical application of his theories has created, and is creating instruments of war more devastating than man has ever known, the scientist might perhaps feel responsible for the fate of our world. However, this pernicious application of science is purely incidental-just as incidental as the beneficial uses to which science can be put. Science and the pursuit of theoretical truth should be unaffected by world events even of the most catastrophic nature. Yet this conviction, however natural we may deem it, is not unchallenged. On the contrary, this war is being waged between two groups of powers, one of which frankly declares science to be solely in the service of the race and the state, while the other group still holds to a science for truth's sake. The wars of the last century were fought between nations whose outlook, at least on this point, was identical. But this war is a war which involves the very character of science qua science. Can the scientist in such a war still follow his path of truth without meeting the challenge? Does not this war involve him, not only as man, but as scientist? Is he not forced to reconsider his "natural feelings" concerning the autarchy of science and reestablish the spiritual founda- tion which is basic to his belief in science for truth's sake? And is not this task of a renewed evaluation of the essence of science a philosophical task? Philosophy, however, we are told, is itself a science. Some radicals among the philosophers claim it is the science. Everybody is agreed at least that philosophy is or ought to be, scientific-whatever that may mean. Like any science, philosophy itself is challenged in its very foundation by the conflagration we are witnessing. Moreover, not only its form as science, but also its subject matter involves philosophy in this war. Behind the clash of arms stand doctrines which are to a great extent the issue of the reflective work of philosophers-Hegel and Nietzsche on the one side,1 the Christian philosophers and the enlightenment culminating in Kant on the other. What this war is about is indicated by con- cepts such as individual, state, liberty, human dignity. Two spiritual worlds clash, worlds rooted in the meditation of the philosopher, worlds so radical and comprehensive that they embrace the meaning of every human activity. Hence, this war has flung philosophy from two sides into an ultimate crisis: on the one hand, in its relation to science; on the other hand, in its relation to the meta- 1 We are concerned here not with the extent to which the Nazis' claim to Hegel and Nietzsche is justified, but simply with the fact that they make this claim.

The philosopher is confronted by the task both of appropriating anew the meaning of science, and of deciding the battle between systems of thought and value whose degenerate representatives are the catchwords employed by Democracy and Fascism. A. The Quest For Rationality Even the most insignificant question asked in the remotest corner of the most negligible science is ultimately nourished by the quest for rationality of the given. The given is originally that in which man happens to find himself, i. e., the world. Rationalization as this term will be used in the following pages, is the reduction of the given to the ratio, or principle, of its essence and existence. Why is the given what it is, and not rather different? Why does the given exist and not rather not exist? To know the reason for the what and the that of the world, to rationalize the irrational, to recreate conceptually the merely given, this desire drives the scientific enterprise into both macro- and micro- cosmos. Whatever motives may have been instrumental in the development of science, whatever interests may have stimulated its growth, whatever seductions may have lured it from its straight course-in the end science, in distinction from art and technique, has one and only one function: the rationalization of the given. The analysis of reason in both Humean and Kantian terms may have shown the impossibility of satisfying the quest for ultimate rationality. Why is there anything and not rather nothing? Why is it what it is and not different? But it would be a grave misunderstanding of Kant's Critique to conclude from the impossibility of answering the question the invalidity of the question itself. To keep alive the question as such, as an eternal reminder of both the source and the limitations of scientific rationalization, is an indispensable task of philosophy. The actual sciences, however, rationalize not the given as such and in its totality, but particular regions of it. To be sure, in the earlier phases of its development, any particular science is animated by the idea of the rationaliza- tion of the given as such. The first physicists, for example, believed themselves to be on the way to a rationalization of nature understood as the all-compre- hensive creatum. Psychology afforded a similar spectacle in the recent past. But the history of physics and psychology shows a slow disillusionment about the universality of their scope, and a final recognition that both the sphere and the procedure of their rationalization are limited. The given as a whole is lost sight of and divided into fields in the cultivation of which ever increasing crops of knowledge are accumulated and preserved in the storehouses of science. Not only is the given split up into different sections; rationalization itself varies greatly with the various sciences. Classification and causal explanation, interpretation and mathematization are kinds of rationalization so different from each other that it may be doubted that they have in common as their essential characteristic the quest for rationality. What is rational in terms of one is superstitious or naive in terms of the other. They do not seem to grant 167</page><page sequence="3">WALTER CERF each other a limited right, as members of the same body, which fulfill different functions. Their claims clash, and in the blind and stubborn exercise of partic- ular methods the summoning voice of radical rationalization is silenced and forgotten. In this situation, philosophy is called upon to accept a fundamental task with respect to science: the critique of the various kinds of rationalization. B. Kinds of Rationalization and Their Ontological Critique The various kinds of rationalization have developed with the advancing sciences, and their growth has seldom been canalized by methodological criticism. Thus they have become victims of unrecognized presuppositions. These presuppositions are categorial, or, as we prefer to call them, ontological. They concern the beingness (substiantiality, einai, Sein) of the beings (tode ti, on, Seiendes) explored by a particular science, or group of sciences. For ex- ample, the science of living organisms, biology, moves in the orbit of an anticipa- tion, howeversvague, of the beingness or substantiality of living organisms, a beingness which, in distinction from the character of mere "thereness" which inanimate beings (qua beings) possess, is called Life (cf. page 18). Hence philosophy, as the critique of the kinds of rationalization, renders explicit and articulates the hidden ontologies which guide the methods of the various sciences. The critique of science ends in the system of ontologies, i. e. of the various sets of categories which circumscribe and characterise the different strata of the given, such as res extensa, artifact, life, man. In order to illustrate the foregoing general remarks we shall now try to sketch some of the ontological presuppositions hidden in the various kinds of rational- ization. a) Classification. Classification, or specification, of the given, presupposes acceptance of an objective, or natural order of things. Man discovers, but does not arbitrarily establish, the goups into which things are ordered. They are ordered into groups by nature, and man's discovery of the natural groups pro- ceeds by tentatively accepting certain qualities as characteristic and essential, i. e., as indicative of the essence of the things to be ordered. The essence itself may be hidden to man. In improving his classification the botanist, for example, believes himself to have come closer to an understanding of his objects, i. e. to an insight into their essences. All classificatory attemps having a truly scientific function presuppose the hylomorphic constitution of their objects. Hylomorphism, in turn, is part of a whole ontological system which derives its chief orientation from a particular mode of beingness, namely from life.2 2 I am not quite certain whether it would not be truer to Aristotle to say that it is artifacts, and not living beings, from which the fundamental categories of hylomorphism are gained. The living beings are the sphere of preferred application of the categories, but not their place of origin. They originate with a phenomenological description of artifacts. How- ever, this would make no difference to our contention, the chief objective of which is to show the dependence of classification upon some ontology-quite apart from naming the particular stratum (life or artifacts) to which this ontology is indigenous. 168</page><page sequence="4">PHILOSOPHY AND THIS WAR b) Causal explanation. To explain a thing causally is to relate it to something else such that the former is taken to be the effect of the latter. Causal explana- tion3 takes the ratio of a thing to be its cause. There is no difference, in prin- ciple, between explaining the existence of a thing and the properties of a thing. We seem to fathom the whole secret of the world and its parts if we know the causes which have made them as they are. The ontological perspective which conditions the method of causal explana- tion is not easily seen. How ratio came to be identified with causa, and causa with temporal succession is perhaps the most interesting and suggestive feature of the development of European thought from the early Greeks to contemporary physicists-a development which is the meeting-place of various ontologies thwarting, replacing, or joining each other. Here, we must be satisfied with stating briefly the crucial moments in this development where a view of the ontological background can be gained. i) The first stage is to be found in the reign of dike governing with equal sway the one all-inclusive cosmos, a cosmos not yet divided into a social and a physical world. The pre-Socratic thinkers did not transplant the concepts of one sphere (state) to the other (nature), or vice versa. There were not two spheres, but only the one realm of dike, including indiscriminately the necessity of stellar motions and the fate of human actions. There is the reverberation of cosmic necessity in the early Greek idea of human fate, and the reverberation of human fate in the Greek conception of cosmic necessity;4 and though aitia (cause) is guilt, guilt is not a moral, but a "fatal" failure. The same dike governs the course of the sun and the fate of Oedipus. ii) When finally the concept of physical cause emerged, it contained two elements which may indeed be called anthropomorphic:5 the productivity of the cause, and the necessity with which the effect follows upon the cause. From the viewpoint of more modern developments, productivity of cause and necessity of effect may truly be said to be conditioned by an ontology which unknowingly derived its chief categories from man's self-understanding or, if one prefers, from inner experience. And the ensuing modern development of the concept of cause may rightly be called a de-humanization of this concept. iii) The most important step in the dehumanization of the concept of cause was taken by Descartes.6 A particular stratum of nature-inanimate nature interpreted as res extensa-was imposed upon the rest of nature. However, the emphasis upon inanimate nature, or matter, is not one implicit in the con- cept of causality. The history of causal explanation was influenced, at this 3 We shall henceforth use the term "explanation" as always meaning "causal explana- tion." 4 Cf.

The Philosophical Review, Vol. L, 1. 169</page><page sequence="5">WALTER CERF decisive turn, by another kind of rationalization, namely mathematization. Under the spell of mathematization, extensio was chosen as the characteristic quality of res corporea, and thus the various strata of beings were leveled down to the stratum of res extensa. Causality had to conform to the res extensa ontology. Causa lost the character of activity. Necessity, on the other hand, which bound the effect to the cause, was still preserved as a last reminder of the origin of the concept of cause in the concept of guilt. iv) The union of mathematization and causal explanation is in itself acci- dental.7 But it has worked smoothly and produced the vast and complex structure of the natural sciences. In more recent developments, however, causal explanation has been degraded to a kind of junior partner. Hume dropped the character of necessity, reducing causality to mere temporal suc- cession. Finally the probability calculus has replaced the search for a cause in whose necessary effect man thought to find satisfaction for his reason. The ship of causality, so heavily laden with anthropomorphic freight when it started its voyage into nature, has come home, its bottom thoroughly emptied by the mathematical pirates. The fact that both classification and causal explanation can be found in one and the same science (biology, for example) should not prevent us from recogniz- ing that they are quite different forms of rationalization, presupposing different categorical systems, each of which is wrong, or primitive, in terms of the other. From the viewpoint of causal explanation, classification is only a primitive precursor of the truly scientific method. From the viewpoint of the hylomorphic ontology on the other hand, causal explanation will never lead to the true principle which can be given solely by a definition grasping the essence of the explicant. Philosophy, as critique of rationalization, gives to both their relative right. In discovering their categorical conditions, philosophy sets for the various kinds of rationalization the limits of their legitimate application. c) Idealization and Mathemetization. We have mentioned the influence of mathematization on causal explanation. In order to understand the ontological background of mathematization, we have now to analyze another kind of rationalization not mentioned in the preceding pages-the process of idealization. Idealization changes certain all-pervasive features of the given into the ideal objects of mathematics (the geometrical and algebraic units). Mathematiza- tion, on the other hand, is the application of mathematics to the given. The ontological background of idealization may be formulated in a single statement. A being which is truly a being ought to be eternal and autarchic. Parmenides expresses the instinctive ontology of the Greeks. A being which is not always what it is and which depends upon other beings is not truly a being. Like Greek art whose ideal classicism testifies to the horrible pressure of Greek reality, Greek mathematics derives its human (existential) motivation from the vertigo caused by the ever-shifting manifestations of the senses, and fromthe 7 Mathematization may be, and has been, united also with classification. An example is Aristotle's analogy of the powers of the soul with geometrical figures. A modern ex- ample: the system of chemical elements. 170</page><page sequence="6">PHILOSOPHY AND THIS WAR horror of the all-engulfing stream of time. Away from the flow of time to the statically eternal, away from the senses and their dependence upon appearances to the nous which is autarchic and eternal, away from non-being to being; this movement of ontological significance is the basis for the idealization of space and time, which produces the eternal types of spatial forms and the eternal moments of the temporal flux. Mathematization, in turn, is rationalization of the given by virtue of the idealization by which the Parmenidean Greeks distilled Eternal Being from ever-flowing non-being. Mathematization, paradoxically enough, re-unites the ideal distillation with the flow of reality. The given becomes rational if we can express it mathematically. What we express mathematically is thus eternalized and autarchized. It partakes of the glory of the nous which, unlike the senses, is autarchic in that it does not depend upon the factual givenness of objects but is identical with its objects, and grasps them in their eternal truth.8 Behind the evaluation of mathematization lies the metaphysical concept of divinity as the self-sufficient eternal being beyond the flux of give and take, and that man, though finite, has a faculty (nous, ratio) which in its autarchy and independence of the senses and the given is, or resembles, the divine. The crisis of the modern natural sciences is to a large extent due to the dis- crepancy between the Parmenidean ontological presuppositions which condition the mathematization of the given, and the ontological structure of the given itself, which defies apparently all attemps at an absolute mathematization. The ideal world-formula striven for by a totally formalized mathematics leaves the given untouched (cf. page 7-8) and ready for a new kind of rationalization, a rationalization which moves in an ontological framework different from the Parmenidean.9 d) Hermeneutical understanding. Since the systematic development of the humanities at the beginning of the last century and continuing in our own day, the establishment of a new kind of rationalization may be observed. History, psychology, sociology, ethnology, anthropology, philology-all of them, insofar as they may have to do with man as a spiritual being and not as a mere organism (cf. page 19), make use of interpretation, i. e., hermeneutical procedures which the Germans call Verstehen, distinguishing it from the explanatory methods of the natural sciences. Interpretation is a kind of rationalization different from all other kinds and having a right of its own based upon the peculiar ontological structure of the subject matter of the humanities. 8 The characteristic quality of beings is, therefore, in the modern beginning of this process of mathematization, extensio. The applicability of geometry to nature is based upon res being extensa. The secondary qualities are to be dismissed altogether, or shown to be rooted in primary qualities, i. e. in mathematizable properties. The mathematical determinations make up what a thing really is. The secondary qualities are mere appear- ance. Furthermore, insofar as a science is mathematical, it is demonstrated science. Demonstration seems to illustrate most clearly the victory of autarchic reason over the factuality and the contigency of the given. 9 Cf. Herman Weyl's latest public lectures in Princeton, N. J. 171</page><page sequence="7">WALTER CERF To be sure, the humanities tried hard, to a certain extent, and are still trying to apply to their subject matter the kinds of rationalization which made possible the victorious course of the natural sciences. Causal explanation and measure- ment were to give a "scientific" fagade to the alleged subjectivism and relativism of the humanities. However, explanation and measurement presuppose an ontological context entirely different from the categorical structure of the field which the humanities explore. In trying to be "scientific" the humanities miss the method appropriate to their own field. Generally speaking, scientific method is not limited to any particular kind of rationalization. On the con- trary, any rationalization becomes unscientific when it is applied to a field having an ontological structure different from that to which it is indigenous. Handicapped by a blindness for ontological conditions in general and for the ontological structure of their own subject matter in particular, the humanities are only now drifting into the current which eventually will carry them off the shoals of bad subjectivism and worse "scientific" presumptions. This current is the new anthropo-ontology (or, in Heidegger's terms, the existential analysis), i. e. the categorial articulation of man. Empirical research without ontological direction is like a ship without a captain, just as ontology without empirical research is like a captain without a ship. Anthropo-ontology gives ontological direction for all the sciences whose object is man. A systematic presentation of anthropo-ontology is beyond the scope of this paper. However, one central feature stressed by the anthropo-ontological approach is relevant to our future argument. And it will, at the same time, permit us to describe the rationalization which is peculiar to the humanities. This feature may be called essentiality. Man's existence is to hold himself in a relation to existence. The essence of existence is open to man, and to man only. Man exists neither like a stone which is a mere "that", a mere fact, nor like an organism which blindly preserves its existence (soozein ten ousian); man exists as holding himself in the task of existing, as accepting or declining the burden of existence. Not only his existence is "before" him as existence is before all living beings, but also his non-existence. Non-existence is a possi- bility for man which "he can stand." Thus he gains distance from existence and can give it a "meaning", or let it meaninglessly glide to its end. To be sure, everything-even man-can be leveled down to mere factuality. The mere thatness of a being in time and space is indeed a basic stratum without which no other kind of being can exist. But this does not mean that a being is nothing but a mere fact. Taken as a fact, man is a certain physical and chemical process in a certain space and at a certain time. As a living being he is already beyond mere factuality, and has a relation to his own existence, the relation of soozein ten ousian,l0 of preserving his existence. But, as man, he not only exists as having a relation to his existence; he also "knows", i. e. holds himself in this relation. The essence, the logos of this relation is open to him. His beingness is self-realization. Such a being cannot be defined because he never 10 Cf. Aristotle, De Anima. 172</page><page sequence="8">PHILOSOPHY AND THIS WAR is what he is, but what he will be. In moral terms, he is what he ought to be. In defining himself man decides himself about himself. Any definition of himself turns back on him and makes him become what he said he is. The subject-matter of the humanities is man. Man, we have seen, is of a unique beingness, a beingness entirely different from, though based upon, the beingness of inanimate and animate beings. Correspondingly, the method of rationalization11 appropriate to the ontological structure of man will be unique. It will be irreducible to any of the kinds of rationalization so far encountered. This method of the humanities is interpretation, or hermeneutical under- standing. Such an understanding is achieved only if we can make the reality of the object a possibility of our own self-realization. The reality of a Raphael painting is nothing if we cannot re-appropriate it. We re-appropriate it when we are able to see in its style a possibility for our own life, a mode of artistic expression still possible within the horizons of our contemporary culture. In understanding the Sistine Madonna we cancel its factuality and give back to it the status, though modified, which it had for the artist-the status of self- realization. In becoming a possibility for our self-realization, it re-acquires its genuine "reality" and, vice versa, in re-acquiring its genuine "reality", it be- comes a possibility for our self-realization. Even if we say "no" to this particu- lar possibility we can do so only on the basis of having understood it, i. e. of having reawakened it to a life which is ours. Thus, for every generation, for every culture, the same fact will have a different meaning. If this is relativism, it is still that kind of rationalization which is the only one appropriate to man's ontological structure, doing full justice to the unique role of possibility in the realm of man. Interpretation, more than any other kind of rationalization, satisfies the thirst for complete insight. In no other region can such total absorption of the "fact" into our own cosmos of meaning be achieved. No other science can gird itself to that ultimate synthesis which, in obsolete terminology, brings about the identity of subject and object. But equally unlike any other science, this com- plete insight must be reconquered by every new generation, and for every new generation the same document, the same work of art, the same historical event will have a different meaning. C. Summary and Pre-view We have now surveyed the chief kinds of rationalization. It will be advisable to summarize the result before we proceed. Science pursues the rationalization of the given. The given we saw separated into "fields" and philosophy is called upon to keep alive the questions concerning the given as such and in its totality. Why is there anything and not rather nothing? Why is it what it is and not rather different? Rationalization has taken various forms, and philosophy is to extract from each of them its proper meaning. As the critique of science, philosophy dams 11 May I stress again that I use this term not in the sense which James Harvey Robinson gave it, but in the sense defined on page 3. 173</page><page sequence="9">WALTER CERF the blind floods of rationalization into their proper beds. Philosophy articulates the ontologies which condition the various kinds of rationalization. Do not these two functions exhaust philosophy's role in respect to science? What else could possibly be required of it? So far, we have accepted rationalization itself as something factual. We have criticized its various kinds; we have brought to the fore its presuppositions; but rationalization of the given is a program which applies to itself. That there is rationalization, and that it is imposed upon man as a most important task, perhaps as his highest achievement-this we have not questioned at all. Why, after all, we must ask now, should the given be rationalized? Why should man be primarily a rational being? Why should he consider the pursuit of truth as his noblest, most human assignment? Should he not rather set before himself as his ultimate end the glory of the state and the supremacy of his race? The relation of philosophy to science was brought to a crisis by the challenge of the Nazis. The radical stage of this crisis has finally been reached. Why should there be rationalization at all? We have come to the point where phi- losophy has no longer to clarify rationalization and to protect it from deviation. Much more is demanded now. Should or should not man see in his reason the highest expression of his humanity? HOMO ANIMALIS VERSUS ZOON LOGON ECHON A. The Non-rational Decision as Basis of Rationalization Science is the pursuit of theoretical truth for its own sake. However, this war is being waged in the name of a new "life" which denies to science its au- tarchy. Hence, this war of all wars touches the life-nerve of science, which has to re-ascertain its most basic condition. This condition, on which science is founded, is beyond science and beyond theoretical truth. The basis is "prac- tical" in character (to use traditional terminology), or existential (in contempor- ary terms).12 The pursuit of theoretical truth is possible only on the basis of a truth which man has of himself. The truth which man has of himself does not say how man is, but it says how man wants himself to be. The pursuit of theoretical truth is made possible in the framework of a decision which man has made concerning himself. This decision was expressed in the Greek definition of man as zoon logon echon. Before John Smith becomes a scientist he must have made up his mind and chosen among the many careers open to him that of the scientist. This, how- ever, is not the decision which is basic to science itself; but rather the affirmation of man as zoon logon echon. Such a definition, as we have seen, is a program of self-realization. Ratio, nous, is to be the highest faculty of man. Man is to be 12 Contemporary Existenz Philosophie limits the term "existence" to man's particular beingness. The peculiarity of man's beingness we have found to lie in his essentiality. Man has not only the relation to existence, which any animal has, i. e. to preserve his existence; he has also a relation to this relation. HIe knows, however inarticulately, that he exists as preserving his existence. His reality is noein ten ousian. 174</page><page sequence="10">PHILOSOPHY AND THIS WAR rational. This self-affirmation of the rational character of man was made at a certain time, in a certain place, by certain individuals. But it has become the spiritual climate of our whole European culture, and all our individual decisions are made in the framework of possibilities which this basic decision has put at our disposal. Without this basic decision no sciences would have been developed, and the career of the scientist would not be one among the possibilities open to our choice. Zoon logon echon is a definition of man purporting to be true. As truth about man it is truth about a being whose peculiar beingness is neither factuality nor life. Man's beingness is self-realization, i. e. the openness for the essence of his existence. Because of this beingness the definition of man as zoon logon echon establishes an ultimate boundary within which man realizes himself. The defini- tion is a decision and a program. Its truth cannot be measured by the actual deliverances of experience, as experience of facts. There are no matters of fact in this field. Its truth is that of a decision, a decision of man about himself, a decision without reason and motive, a non-rational decision.'3 Philosophy, as critique of science, elaborates the ontology of man. Man's beingness is self-realization. Philosophy is at last ready to accept the definition of zoon logon echon as a decision. Reason itself recognizes its non-rational basis. The non-rational source which precedes all rational science is, itself, rationally acknowledged by the guardian of science. Irrational in the ordo essendi, the basic primal decision has a rational position in the ordo cognoscendi. The defini- tion that man is rational has had a history such that we have finally come to learn that this definition is a non-rational decision. Philosophy has achieved an insight into the decisional character of the definition which is at the bottom of all science. The pursuit of theoretical truth moves within the limits of a decision by which man defines himself as rational being. It is exactly this essential decision of man about himself which is challenged today by another decision driving man in another direction of self-realization. The attempts to lay bare the categorial foundations of science, which have been outlined in the previous section, still presuppose as unquestioned the decision that man should rationalize the given and himself. The new "ideology" is directed, not against our actual science, but against the basic decision which is the condition of any scientific enterprise. The new definition of man stresses super-individual entities such as race and state. Man is primarily a racial being. His humanity lies in his giving himself entirely up to the larger interests of racial and civil organization. It is between these two decisions that the present war is being waged. This war is the attempt to make the new decision the spiritual climate of the epochs to come. The era of the animal rationale, the Nazis contend, has come to an end. The great age of the homo animalis has begun. Before we proceed to ask how the issue between the two basic decisions can be resolved, let us probe a little deeper into the character of these decisions. Can they really be called decisions? Who makes them? Between which alterna- 13 This non-rationality of the basic decision will be analyzed more fully on page 28. 175</page><page sequence="11">WALTER CERF tives are they made? And in what sense are they basic? These questions concern the form of the basic decisions, their character as decision. But they do not inquire into the content of the decisions. We do not propose to go into the latter, and for this reason: the issue between the two basic decisions will be resolved, not through a critical consideration of their content, but only by in- sight into the consequences which are implied in their form as decisions.l4 B. The Formal Structure of the Basic Decision Why do we call the basic decision non-rational? In comparison with a statement about matter of fact any decision, even the most rational one, appears to be irrational. Under normal conditions I am running no risk of being corrected in asserting that the table is brown. There is little chance that such a statement misses its object. This risk is much greater even in simple decisions concerning every-day states of affairs. Who can pretend ever to have made a decision without "taking chances", a decision which meas- ured with certainity the advantages and disadvantages of its implications? And, once embarked upon a decision, into what unpredictable situations will we be brought, to what new decisions (equally irrational) will we be forced? If we call the basic decision non-rational, it is not this comparative irrationality that we want to point out. The non-rationality of the basic decision is of a different character. We shall better understand the non-rationality of the basic decision when we have considered more carefully the formal structure of decisions as they are made in our daily life. An everyday decision implies a choice between alternative possibilities, made by some individual. This choice, if rational, is guided by insight into the moral quality of the ends, by anticipation of advantages and disadvantages to be derived, and by deliberation concerning the ways and means to achieve the end chosen. If these three moments (insight into the moral structure, antic- ipation of advantages and disadvantages, and deliberation concerning ways and means) are wanting, the decision is irrational, in the sense that reason has played no part, or only a negligible part, in determining the choice between the alternatives. The choice then has its ratio in some whim, emotion, or accidental factor. But in both cases-in rational and in irrational decision-there is always a particular individual and a particular set of alternatives. There is the individual confronted by a set of possibilities and, inherent in this con- frontation, the individual's knowledge of it; and there is a final preference for one of the possibilities. We repeat: whether this preference is determined by 14 This statement anticipates the following section C, and will be fully understood only only in its later context. But it had to be mentioned here in order to explain our not dealing with the content and the history of the issue. The general formulation of the material issue as given on pages 2 and 26 will do for our purposes. And, as to the historical back- ground of the warring ideologies, it suffices to know that the Nazis claim Hegel and Nietzsche as their spiritual ancestors, while the democrats claim to build on the great rational tradition of philosophy from Aristotle through the doctors of the church to Kant and the Neo-Stoics of the Enlightenment. Cf. W. T. Stace, The philosophical issues involved in this war, Philosophy Vol. XVI, No. 63. 176</page><page sequence="12">PHILOSOPHY AND THIS WAR rational insight and deliberation or by whim and emotion leaves the essential structure of decision qua decision untouched. The non-rationality of the basic decision belongs to a quite different order. It has nothing in common with the irrationality of our everyday decisions. It does not concern the motivations or any other particular structural ingredients of the decisional situation. It concerns this situation as a whole and is an all- pervasive modification of it. If the word were not fraught with ambiguous associations, we might use the term "transcendental" instead of "non-rational". Our task is, then, to describe the modifications of the structural ingredients which distinguish the basic decision from the decision proper. Let us begin with the set of alternatives among which the choice is made. We shall develop this point at some length and treat the rest more superficially. Not only is there no such set of possibilities confronting the subject of the decision; the possibility chosen is created by this very choice. That man is a rational animal was not one of the possibilities among which the first Greeks could choose. It was they who created the possibility, thus drawing a horizon around their world which distinguished it from any other culture. Similarly, that man is an image of God was not one of many possible ideas which the Jews were confronted with; but it was they who created the possibility of man's envisaging himself as an image of God. Once established, this possibility functioned as an ultimate horizon determining the spiritual world of the genera- tions to come. It set free concrete possibilities quite different from the possibili- ties which confront a member of any culture to which this decision has not been basic. These examples will have made clear why such decisions must be qualified as basic and non-rational. They are basic because they form the conditioning horizon for decisions properly so-called. And they are non-rational because, while decisions and not statements, they defy being brought under the structural scheme of decisions. We have, as yet, seen but one mark of this defiance, though the most important one. We shall now cast a brief glance at the other modifications which the decisional structure suffers in a basic decision. There is no individual subject who takes the basic decision, i. e. who creates the cultural horizon. The individual who might be pointed out as the subject of the decision (Aristotle, Moses) acquires a status of transindividuality. Aris- totle, when he defined man as zoon logon echon, acts (in Hegelian terms) as the mouthpiece of the Greek spirit; and Moses is the charismatic leader, closer to God than to his people. The basic decision is not taken as a decision. The creation of the basic possibility is, as it were, one big Yes, and a No-i. e., blindness-for everything else. Finally, it is an unmotivated decision, not only in that no reasons are given, but also in that no reasons can be given except in terms of values created by this decision itself. That is, it is a decision which is its own reason. We have outlined the formal structure of the basic decision in the only way this can be done, i. e. by showing negatively the modification which the structural 177</page><page sequence="13">WALTER CERF ingredients of a decision proper undergo in a basic decision. No doubt a whole philosophy of history would have to be written to define both the metaphysical foundations and the implications of this concept of basic decision. But the fact that perspectives into a "metaphysics of the spirit" reveal themselves at this point must not make us suspicious of the preceding remarks which belong rather to a phenomenology of history. But what relevance can considerations about the form of the basic decision have for the content of the ideological issue of this war? A solution of this ideological issue is the great task of present-day philosophy. How can formal reflections be of any use in deciding, not the form, but the content of the clashing systems? Our formal reflections will be of decisive value. They enable us to determine how such a conflict of basic decisions can alone be solved. Paradoxically enough, the academic and abstract consideration of how the issue between basic decisions can be solved will give us the cue for the concrete and pressing question: Which side shall we choose, the side of the rationalist15 or of the racist, Democrat or Nazi? C. How Can an Issue between Basic Decisions be Solved? How can the issue between the two basic decisions find a solution? Let us take a simple example from the field of decisions proper, such as an argument between a man who chose to be a scientist, and another who preferred the career of a politician. If they try to convince each other of their respective superiority, how will they proceed? There seem to be only three ways: theoretical argumentation, pragmatic experiment, and moral measurement. Theoretical argumentation may either proceed by a priori reasoning or by finding out "the facts". Pragmatic experi- ment, on the other hand, sets out to test the workability of the assertion. The third procedure, finally, embarks upon moral considerations concerning the value of the alternative ends. These, then, are the methods for solving an issue between everyday decisions. We shall see that in none of these ways is a solution of the issue between the two basic decisions forthcoming. The nature, or, as we said before, the form of the basic decision excludes these kinds of argumentative procedure. It will be advisable to review the reasons for this exclusion in some detail. Since there can be no a priori deductions, either of the rational or of the racial essence of man, the adversaries would have to try to convince each other through facts. They would have to point out facts which do not fit into the other's theory. And indeed they have tried, and are still trying, to convince each other in this way. The rational scientist will incur no great labor in assembling facts which contradict the race theoretician; and, vice versa, there are a great many instances on which the followers of the race myth can draw to point out to the rationalist the racial conditions of human reason. 15 We shall call rationalist anybody who, directly or indirectly, implicitly or explicitly, upholds the value of reason above and against the value of race. Even the empirical scientist would be a rationalist in our use of the term. 178</page><page sequence="14">PHILOSOPHY AND THIS WAR But such a discussion is entirely illusory. Not only do the two decisions mistake themselves for "scientific theories"-while they are, as we have seen, according to the peculiar structure of their subject-matter, programs of human self-realization. Such programs cannot be defeated by facts since they are creative of their facts. But what is more, argumentation and the attempt to convince each other presuppose as medium of discussion the acknowledgement of reason and truth for their own sake. Yet it is just this medium which one of the partners to the discussion does not acknowledge and wants to replace with something else. That is, the rationalist, in trying to get his man to argue with him, has begged the question. But, on the other hand, does not the racist, whenever he wants to express himself, make use of statements and combinations of statement, so-called theories, which claim to be true? Hence, even the anti-rationalists have to use the medium of reason, thus demonstrating their own inconsequence and in- feriority. However, this is futile reasoning. The racist descends into the arena of argumentation because he does not yet understand the a-theoretical character of his own "theories". But it may be expected that he will soon live up to the character of this "theory". Or he uses the old ruse of the wolf in sheep's cloth- ing so that he may come close to his victims-just as, in the political field, it is expedient to use the democratic means of disseminating anti-democratic doc- trines. The danger lies just in the fact that the rationalists are led to believe that, after all, even the new men have their theories which as such are subjected to the test of truth. The racist knows better than the old-school rationalist that his definition of man is a program to be executed and not a statement of what man is. He expresses himself in the theoretical medium of truth: "The Aryan is a superior man. Man is primarily a racial being." The rationalist does not recognize that this apparent statement is a decision, a program-or, if you wish, a desire. It is not something to be refuted, but something to be fought against, and to be fought against by a renewed self-appropriation of man as rational being. The rationalist is fatally weak if he thinks that he can demonstrate. In such matters, truth is practical and not theoretical. The rationalist is lost if he tries to draw the racist into his theoretical medium. He has to live up to the fact that behind his adversary's theories the program of a new era lurks. And, more important, he has to live up to the other fact that behind his own theoretical pursuit of truth there lies the existential practical decision that man is human by virtue of his reason-a non-rational decision concerning his ratio- a decision beyond the possibility of argumentation. As a second way of deciding the issue between the two basic decisions we mentioned the experimental or pragmatic one. Here the practical character of what on its surface seems to be a theory is recognized and, in a liberal spirit, each program is permitted to work. Each theory is given a chance to be tested by the results of its realization. There are various roads for pursuing the happiness of mankind. To the liberal and scientific mind each way has its right, and only experience can help us to distinguish the way that is easier or faster. 179</page><page sequence="15">WALTER CERF This is a lovably tolerant standpoint, and its adherents are still numerous. They know the dangers of their tolerance, but what they seem to be blind to is that such a test is fair only if each of the participants will submit to it in the same liberal, scientific spirit as they do. Without the fulfillment of this condition the test is nonsensical and their tolerance self-destroying. Most certainly, the new theory will never subscribe to this condition. It will go ahead with the fury of a forest fire and claim that as long as there are still trees unburnt and countries uncontrolled it has not had much of a chance. "The New Era" claims the whole world, or it would not be the new era. No limits can be set to such a fire by the free allotment of a sphere where it can rage as it likes. This fire will not, cannot keep its promise of self-limitation. Each new allot- ment will increase its hunger and rage. There will be no judges to appeal to, and, if there were judges, no police to enforce their ruling. Such a fire can be extinguished only by an ocean of arms. Without new fuel it will burn out of itself. And there is the hope that once again forests will grow where cinders now cover the offended ground. Finally, there is the belief in the valuational way of deciding the issue. Can there be any doubt that reason is a higher value than race? There can be such a doubt. And more than that: the racist will with the same outraged conviction ask if there can be any doubt that race is a higher value than reason. A comparison between different value systems must make one of the value systems arbitrarily the norm for judging about the others-and thus the question is begged. The liberal talks with and evaluates the fascist in terms of his liberal values, and the fascist is lost from the beginning. The fascist evaluates the liberal from the viewpoint of the fascist system of values, and the liberal never has so much as a chance to open his mouth. A spectacle of mutual fairness which is utterly unfair! Or the various opposed value systems are embraced by one all-comprehensive system, in terms of which a just appraisal of the single systems can be rendered. Such an all-embracing system of values must postulate a value, or values, higher than reason and race which are supreme in the partial systems of the rationalist and racist. Now, while the acknowledgment of such a higher value is quite reconcilable with rationalism (as the Christian philosophers strikingly show), it is absolutely irreconcilable with the cult of state and race. This cult does not suffer anything above its own gods, race and state. Although, for political reasons, a compromise may seem expedient, the Church, religion, and, generally speaking, man's relation to God will be let in only as a kind of junior partner. The recognition of a value higher than their most cherished idols would take the life blood out of the Nazi doctrine. Hence, even this last refuge of reconciliation and compromise has to be given up, and we must conclude that there is no valua- tional possibility at all of deciding the issue between the basic decisions. But if this issue cannot be solved in any of the ways enumerated, how can it be solved at all? The issue between the two basic decisions can be solved only by decision- by the same kind of irrational decision which is at the basis of both the definition 180</page><page sequence="16">PHILOSOPHY AND THIS WAR of man as zoon logon echon and of man as homo animalis. This is a battle fought between decisions, a struggle between wills-not a discrepancy of theories to be settled argumentatively, or an antagonism of values to be bridged valuationally. The decision between the opposite systems is a non-rational decision, a decision which is its own reason and which proceeds with the simple force of: I want myself rational; or, I want myself racial! To the superficial rationalist, unaware of the non-rational source of his reason, the decision which is asked of him will be beyond his understanding. He does not see that the decisional character of man's existence (cf. page 28) makes the basic decision more "rational" than any choice, rational or irrational, between alternative possibilities. The definition of man as zoon logon echon is a program of self-realization, and, like any program, it will remain a mere program if the will which made it is too weak to execute it. If the rationalists are not strong enough to be non-rational rationalists, their adversaries will have won the battle without a stroke, and the millenia of reason will indeed have come to their end. The arrow of rationalism was shot from the bow of an irrational decision. Today upon us falls the task of bending this bow again. D. Democracy and Science The same situation is mirrored in the medium of politics. The fate of science and philosophy is intimately connected with the fate of democracy. We shall, therefore, conclude our discussion with a "political" consideration. Both science and democracy move within the same ultimate horizon. Science rationalizes the given. Democracy is based upon the belief that man is rational. Because man is rational, he is endowed with a dignity which no other being has. Because he has this dignity each man is equal to any other man. Because he is rational each man can rule himself, i. e. he is free. Because he is free, he can accept the laws of others as if they were given by himself to himself. Because he is free, he does not accept any laws which he could not have given to himself. He trusts that his fellow men will accept the same rules in the same spirit as he does himself. This trust is the life blood of democracy. Man trusts in the lumen naturale of every other man. He trusts in it, and it is this trust which induces him to become worthy of this trust. Man is not rational, he is on the way to becoming rational. Nothing is more educative than the universal trust that man is rational. It is this belief which makes man become rational. Democracy is not based upon rationality as an actual quality of man, but based upon the trust, the belief that man will become rational, a belief which is itself the first actualization of man's being rational. This belief is the true atmosphere of democracy. Without it democracy is but a caricature. Because democracy is the realization of man as a rational being in his social intercourse, democracy is fully justified in not permitting any views to be ex- pressed which are against its own goal, and likely to disturb the belief in man's dignity, equality, and liberty. The democracies must not think themselves unfaithful to their own principles if they do not give free rein to voices which 181</page><page sequence="17">WALTER CERF preach destruction of democracy. If the democracies recognize that they are based on a "practical" truth, on a truth about what man should be, if the democracies are strong and young enough to consider themselves as being basically "on the road" towards a certain ideal of man and society, if the de- mocracies regain their old spirit of realization, instead of being just a reality, then they can consistently deny a voice to anybody who affirms an ideal of man contrary to the one in whose service democracy lives. Those democracies which have forgotten that they are "on their way" to making man free and en- lightened, and which sleep happily in the belief that they possess what they have yet to achieve, will be too weak to shut the mouths of their foes. They will be too weak to fight. At the basis of democracy does not stand the theoretical truth that man is free and intelligent, but the practical truth that man ought to be free and in- telligent. Democracy is the implement through which this goal can be achieved, not the expression of its actual achievement. Democracy is true to itself when, and only when, it prevents all other basic decisions from thwarting its own way. As long as democracy knows itself to be in the service of an idea of man which is to be realized, and reaffirms every day its basic decision about what man should be, so long will democracy live and win.
