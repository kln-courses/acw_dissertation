<plain_text><page sequence="1">"MERKAVAH TRADITIONS IN PHILOSOPHICAL GARB: JUDAH HALEVI RECONSIDERED" ELLIOT R. WOLFSON I It is generally agreed that the twelfth century was a critical time when both philosophy and mysticism began to have a greater impact on the intellectual development of Jews living in central Europe. On the one hand, ancient Jewish mystical speculation on the divine chariot (merkavah) cultivated in the Talmudic and Geonic periods was joined together with a "new" theo- sophic conception of divinity, and kabbalah took its place on the stage of literary history. It is assumed, for instance, that sometime in this century the Sefer ha-Bahir, held by Scholem and others to be the first text fully dedicated to theosophical kabbalah, appeared in Provence.1 It was also in this very geographical region during this century that other, apparently autonomous, circles of kabbalists appeared on the scene, the most well-known being the circle of R. Abraham ben David of Posquieres and his son, R. Isaac the Blind.2 In this same period 1 Cf. G. Scholem, Origins ofthe Kabbalah (Princeton, 1987), pp. 49-198. See also M. Idel, "The Problem of the Sources of the Bahir" [Hebrew] Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought 6 (1987): 55-72; idem, Kabbalah: New Perspectives (New Haven, 1988), pp. 122-127. 2 Cf. Scholem, Origins, pp. 199-309. Thus Scholem concludes his survey of the kabbalah of RABaD and R. Isaac the Blind: "For our analysis it suffices to have demonstrated that in the fragments from Isaac a specific and completely independent form of the Kabbalah, very different from the world of the Bahir as we have learned to know it, can be localized and identified in Provence. The seed of the Bahir, landing in Provence, germinated in a singular manner." See also M. Idel, "The Sefirot above the Sefirot" [Hebrew], Tarbiz 51 (1982): 239; idem, New Perspectives, p. 136.</page><page sequence="2">180 ELLIOT R. WOLFSON [2] the merkavah corpus began to have a profound influence on the emerging theosophical speculations of Pietistic circles in North- ern France and the Rhineland who not only faithfully copied the older materials but creatively developed ideas contained therein which in some cases have strong phenomenological similarity to mainstream kabbalistic conceptions.3 On the other hand, it was in this century that in the European continent Jewish philosophy - an amalgam of Aristotelianism and Neoplatonism4 - had gained an increasing audience, largely due to the composition of original texts in Hebrew and the translation of older texts from Arabic into Hebrew. 3 The relationship of German Pietistic speculation to the theosophic kabba- lah which flourished in Provence and Northern Spain has been the subject of much scholarly discussion.

Through the work of several schol- ars, however, we have come to appreciate the extent to which philosophical texts in and of themselves should be considered as important sources for the preservation of earlier mystical ideas that may have, in turn, helped to generate the literary renaissance of kabbalah.5 Indeed, it would be wrong to assume that the philosophical personalities of medieval Jewry, before the thirteenth century, were devoid of mystical tendencies or influences. It seems to me that any such bifurcation is largely colored by the writings of Maimonides (1135-1204) which, in spite of any formal similarity to medieval kabbalistic herme- neutics, have little to do with the positive content of earlier Jewish mystical documents.6 That Maimonides was familiar with at least some of these we know with certainty from the fact that he had occasion to refer to the Shi'ur Qomah both in an earlier work, the Commentary on the Mishnah, and in a later responsum. Whereas in the former he showed a positive dis- position towards this text, calling for the need of an extended commentary, in the latter he not only concluded that the treatise was a Byzantine forgery but equated the study of it with idolatry.7 It can also be safely assumed that Maimonides had access to Sefer Ye$irah, though he does not mention it by name.8 Finally, it has been demonstrated that Maimonides had 5 Cf.

He even has little, if any, use to make of standard aggadic texts which strike of a merka- vah character. Those who would like to appropriate Maimon- ides as a Jewish mystic by seeing him as a figure who combined philosophy and mysticism - espousing therefore a type of intellectualist mysticism0 - miss the essential point, in my opinion. The mystical dimension of Neoplatonism is indisputa- ble, as is the historical claim that this school of philosophy influenced Maimonides, primarily through Arabic writers who had assimilated Neoplatonic texts. IO The critical question from my vantage point is Maimonides' relation to Jewish mystical doctrine as expressed in a given literary corpus determined not by scholars but by the community of mystics themselves. When the question is phrased in this way, I find the evidence wanting. Indeed, it seems to me that one could make a very good case Homilies," Proceedings of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities 7 (1989): 127-132. 9 Cf. M.

Blumenthal, vol. 3 (Atlanta, 1988), pp. 1-16. The same critique, in my opinion, may be levelled against those who would impute to Maimonides the mystical elements that emerge more overtly in the Jewish Sufism of his son, Abraham, and grandson, 'Obadyah. I do not mean to deny the mystical element in the Sufi piety cultivated by Jews, but only question the validity of identifying this as a factor in determining the relationship of Maimonides himself to the esoteric traditions of Jewish mysticism.

The content of the mysteries of ma'aseh bereshit (physics) and ma'aseh merkavah (metaphysics), however, is very much deter- mined by philosophic notions that are exoteric in nature, ascertained by the use of natural reason. Moreover, the utilitari- an-instrumental approach to the commandments that underlies Maimonides' discussion of ta'ame ha-mi4wot is completely exoteric in its orientation.13 Kabbalists in the thirteenth century were well aware of this subversion and attempted to counter it by composing what they considered to be authentic - i.e., indigeneously Jewish - commentaries on Genesis and Ezeki- el's chariot as well as propagating the mystical reasons for the commandments.14 " Cf. M. Idel, "Sitre 'Arayot in Maimonides' Thought," in Maimonides and Philosophy, ed. S. Pines and Y. Yovel (Boston, 1986), pp. 79-91; idem, New Perspectives, p. 252. 12 Cf. I.

WOLFSON [6] The aim of this paper is to show, however, that in the pre- Maimonidean philosophical thought15 of Judah Halevi (ca. 1075-1141) ancient Jewish chariot-mysticism, especially as it was interpreted in the Geonic literature, had a decisive in- fluence.'6 To this end I will focus on some of the themes connected with Halevi's understanding of prophecy and revela- tory experience, for it is with respect to these key issues that one can most readily discern the centrality of earlier merkavah traditions. That Halevi knew some of these texts is beyond question as is attested by the fact that in the Kuzari he men- tioned several of the relevant documents by name. Thus in nrril,:), and the secret of the commandments (nlxm n 110; cf. the reading in MS Paris 850, fol. 118a: the secret of the performance of the commandments, no mlX1a ;nr1yn). Cf. Sefer Razi'el (Amsterdam, 1701), fol. 7c. The text has been printed as well in Sode Razaya' ed. S. Weiss (Jerusalem, 1988), p. 1. See, by contrast, Eleazar's enumeration of esoteric disciplines in IHokhmat ha-Nefesh, ch. 2 (Bene Beraq, 1987), p. 14: the secret of the chariot (:1m'in n0o), the secret of creation (nPt}'xa mwyt '11o), and the secret of unity (nlmn n11). The latter is known by one who knows the secret of the wisdom of the soul (JS3;1 nrln 110). 15 In using the expression "philosophical thought" in relation to Halevi I do not wish to take issue with the claim of those who would not regard the Kuzari as a philosophic book. Cf. L. Strauss, Persecution and the Art of Writing (New York, 1952), p. 98. Strauss is right to characterize Halevi's dialogue "primarily as a defence of Judaism against philosophy" (p. 103), and in that sense it is a work of kalam (pp. 99-100). It is nevertheless appropriate, in my view, to refer to the philosophical thought of Halevi, by which I mean his overall religious philosophy. The latter, while in some fundamental ways at odds with the leading philosophic positions of Halevi's day, is expressed at times in terms and modes of discourse derived from philosophy proper, a point well-made in the scholarly literature. 16 The complicated relationship between philosophy and mysticism in Jew- ish sources - mostly in a period later than that of Halevi - has been studied most thoroughly by Alexander Altmann and Georges Vajda. For the former, see the essays collected in Altmann, Studies in Religious Philosophy and Mysticism (Ithaca, 1969). For the latter, see the studies referred to in G. Vajda, "Recherches sur la synthese philosophico-kabbalistique de Samuel Ibn Motot," Archives d'histoire doctrinale et litteraire du Moyen Age (1960): 29, n. 1 (= Melanges Georges Vajda, p. 661, n. 1).</page><page sequence="7">[7] MERKAVAH TRADITIONS IN PHILOSOPHICAL GARB 185 III:65 Halevi identifies the tanna, R. Ishmael ben Elisha the High Priest, as the one who is mentioned in the "Hekhalot, Hakkarat Panim, and Ma'aseh Merkavah. He knew all these secrets to the point that he merited a grade proximate to prophecy" (fil=:'N I ni:1'p ni.').17 It is noteworthy that Halevi compares knowing secrets of the merkavah to prophecy, a point to which I will return at a later stage in this analysis. What needs to be emphasized here is that the three items listed above are references to specific literary works. In the case of the first two, Hekhalot and Hakkarat Panim, this is fairly obvious, the former referring in all probability to one of the main and most widely disseminated texts of the merkavah corpus, Sefer Hekha- lot also known as 3 Enoch,'8 in which R. Ishmael figures prominently, while the latter refers to a chapter on chiromancy entitled Hakkarat Panim le-Rabbi Yishma'el, also part of the same corpus.19 The same can be said with respect to the third reference given by Halevi, Ma'aseh Merkavah. As Scholem has already pointed out, this title was used by medieval authors in basically three ways: (a) to cover a general collection of Hekha- lot books, (b) to refer specifically to either Hekhalot Rabbati or Shi'ur Qomah, or (c) to name another Hekhalot text which Scholem himself published from manuscript and called by this 17 Cf. Kuzari, : 103, where one is said to come close to the degree of prophecy through the doing of good deeds, sanctification, purification, and being close to the prophets. See also V: 12 where the hasid is depicted as being one level below the prophet. Halevi's association of pious behavior and the attainment of a degree which approximates that of the prophets had an impact on the Jewish- Sufi Pietism of Abraham Maimonides and his circle. Cf. P.

WOLFSON [8] title.20 In IV:3 Halevi again mentions Ma'aseh Merkavah but this time together with Shi'ur Qomah,2' thereby eliminating the possibility that for him Ma'aseh Merkavah refers to Shi'ur Qomah. It must be concluded, therefore, that Halevi had in mind either the general collection of Hekhalot books or another particular Hekhalot treatise. Given the fact that Halevi enumer- ates Ma'aseh Merkavah together with Hekhalot and Hakkarat Panim in one instance and with Shi'ur Qomah in the other, I am inclined to accept the latter possibility. Halevi's intimate knowledge of early Jewish mysticism is attested as well by his elaborate commentary on Sefer Yesirah in IV:25-27. Refer- ences to that work are also to be found in 111:17 and V:14. Furthermore, Halevi's religious poetry abounds with images taken from the merkavah literature as will be shown in the relevant places in the present analysis.22 That Halevi's writings - both the speculative dialogue and the religious poems - reflect a mystical strain should come as 20 Cf. G. Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, Merkabah Mysticism, and Talmudic Tradition (New York, 1965), pp. 101-102. Curiously, in this context Scholem did not mention Halevi in his discussion of the medieval authors who refer to Ma'aseh Merkavah. Concerning the use of this title see also the remarks of P. Schafer, "Tradition and Redaction in Hekhalot Literature," reprinted in idem, Hekhalot-Studien (Tubingen, 1988), p. 13. 21 Cf. Altmann, Studies, p. 188. 22 To be sure, the influence of merkavah imagery on liturgical poetry (especially the classical 'ofan form) is not unique to Halevi or even to Andalu- sian Hebrew poets. On the contrary, this is a common feature found in medieval poets in Spain, Northern France, Germany and Italy, Cf. E. Fleischer, Hebrew Liturgical Poetry in the Middle Ages [Hebrew] (Jerusalem, 1975), p. 454; idem, The Yo;er Its Emergence and Development [Hebrew] (Jerusalem, 1984), pp. 252-267, 522, 620, 671. The relationship between Hekhalot hymns and formal- ized Synagogue prayers, especially the qedushah, has been the subject of much scholarly debate. Cf. I. Gruenwald, "Angelic Songs, the Qedushah and the Problem of the Origin of the Hekhalot Literature," in idem, From Apocalypti- cism to Gnosticism (Frankfurt am Main, 1988), pp. 145-173, and references to other scholarly literature on pp. 145-146, nn. 3-7.

The possible influence of Islamic mysticism, especially in the form of Isma'ilism, on Judah Halevi has been suggested by several scholars, most notably, David Kaufmann,23 Ignaz Goldziher,24 Israel Efros25 and Shlomo Pines,26 while others have readily acknowledged the more general influence of Arabic Neoplato- nism upon his thought.27 Scholars have also noted the mystical tendencies in Halevi's poetry.28 Halevi's indebtedness to Jewish mysticism, however, and, in particular, merkavah traditions, has been less frequently noted in the scholarly literature, the one major exception being Moshe Idel.29 In the following sections I 23 D.

WOLFSON [10] wish to concentrate on some aspects of Halevi's thought which derive from merkavah speculation in both its classical and Geonic formulations. To be sure, as will be shown in the course of my analysis, these older mystical themes were combined with more contemporary Neoplatonic ideas and structures of thought, in some cases perhaps filtered through Sufi channels. It is nevertheless the case that Halevi was utilizing ancient Jewish mystical doctrine. The blending of merkavah imagery with Neoplatonism represents an important stage in the evolution of medieval Jewish thought. A fresh analysis of this dimension in Halevi's writings will undoubtedly enhance our appreciation of the soil that nurtured the intellectual roots of kabbalah.30 II The influence of the merkavah traditions upon Halevi is brought out most clearly in the Kuzari, IV:3.31 In a lengthy passage on the various divine names and the nature of pro- phetic revelation, Halevi notes, inter alia, that the verse, 'And under His feet there was the likeness of a pavement of sapphire' (Exod. 24:10), alludes to the fact that the nobles of Israel "perceived a spiritual form" (r'iTrnmlK ,ni'lK) which is called Studies, p. 188, while discussing Halevi's positive evaluation of Shi'ur Qomah in Kuzari, IV:3: "Jehuda Ha-Levi need not, of course, have expressed here his entire view of the work. Close as he was to Jewish mysticism, he might have regarded it as a repository of profound mysteries." 30 A separate question, not the subject of this inquiry, is that of the affinity of later kabbalists for Halevi and their borrowing from or dependence upon his writings. Cf. Kaufmann, Geschichte der Attributenlehre, pp. 166-167, n. 120, and references to other scholarly literature given there. For Halevi's particular influence on the Gerona kabbalists, see Scholem, Origins, pp. 410-411, and references given in n. 107. 31 In preparation of this paper the following editions have been consulted: Kitdb al-Radd wa-'l Dalilfi 'I-Din al-Dhalil, ed. D. Baneth and H. Ben-Shammai (Jerusalem, 1977); Sefer ha-Kuzari, trans. Yehudah ibn Tibbon; Sefer ha- Kuzari, trans. Yehudah Even-Shmu'el (Jerusalem, 1972).</page><page sequence="11">[11] MERKAVAH TRADITIONS IN PHILOSOPHICAL GARB 189 the "God of Israel." In the continuation of the same passage we are told that this "divine form" (inix OKN)32 appears to human imagination in the most noble image, viz., that of a human being. In yet another comment in the same context there is a remark to the effect that in the time of Moses the vision of the spiritual form or light was available to persons other than prophets. Indeed, in a subsequent section of the Kuzari (IV: 1) Halevi contrasts Moses' spiritual leadership with that of others on the grounds that Moses did not seek to limit prophetic revelation to the isolated few. On the contrary, Moses made the people stand near Mount Sinai "to see the light that he had seen ... and afterward he called the seventy elders and they saw it, as it says, 'They saw the God of Israel."' The visible pole of revelation is therefore identified by Halevi as the God of Israel.33 32 Ibn Tibbon translates Halevi's expression 'aid jurah in a somewhat ambiguous manner as 'Inrl, i.e., "his image." For a more literal rendering see Even-Shmu'el, Sefer ha-Kuzari, p. 162: mlK rn ms. 33 It should be noted that the expression 'God of Israel' occurs in several biblical passages where some visionary experience of the divine is posited, most notably Exod. 24:10. Presumably, based on this usage Ezekiel adopted the terminology "glory of the God of Israel" (lt,w rUT 'n1 :n) to refer to the object of his vision. Cf. Ezek. 8:4, 10:19, 10:20, 11:22, 43:2, 44:2. The technical signification of the term 'itu ',niK in a theophanic context was not lost to subsequent generations of Jewish writers. Thus, for example, the term is used frequently in the textual units comprised within the corpus of Hekhalot literature. Cf. P. Schafer, Konkordanz zur Hekhalot-Literatur (Tiibingen, 1986), s.v. xV'W, pp. 322-324, where numerous occurrences of the epithet "God of Israel" are recorded in the various manuscript codices in which these texts have been preserved. The merkavah mystics consciously chose this expression to refer to the aspects of God which were apprehended through the ecstatic-mystical experience. I would suggest that the verse in Exodus regarding the seeing of the God of Israel at Sinai, as well as its reflex in Ezekiel's vision of the glory of the God of Israel, probably informed the merkavah mystics' choice of this epithet to serve as a terminus technicus for the visible aspect of the divine glory. Analogously, as I will set out to demonstrate, in the case of Halevi the God of Israel is not merely a descriptive term qualifying the proper name of</page><page sequence="12">The spiritual form (al-purah al-rtuhdniyyah) which, as we have seen, Halevi equated with the biblical "God of Israel," is further identified by him as the world of the merkavah and all that is comprised in this world: the various classes of angels, the throne, and the visible aspect of the glory itself. That Halevi interpreted the throne-world of ancient Jewish mysticism in these terms is evident from his description of R. Aqiva as one "who approached the level of prophecy until [the point that] he had contact with the world of the spiritual entities (ftKy ,,91rfnm)), as it says, Four entered the Pardes ... one entered in peace and exited in peace. Who was it? R. Aqiva" (III:65).34 Pines suggested that this passage must be understood against the background of the term pneumata derived from Greek magical-theurgical texts of Late Antiquity which was rendered in Arabic philosophic sources as al-ruhaniyyat.35 While this etymology may be correct, as seems to be supported by other passages in Halevi, in this specific context it is important to emphasize that which Pines failed to note, viz., here the world of spiritual entities, 'aldm al-ruhadniyyan ('olam ha-ruha- niyyim), is identified with the aggadic Pardes which is under- stood by Halevi as the celestial throne-world. That is to say, therefore, that in this case at least the spiritual entities comprise God, but is rather a technical expression used to characterize the visible forms of divinity. In my opinion this is no mere coincidence, but represeuts a discernible philological link that connects Halevi with the Jewish mystical texts of which he was certainly aware. See also Judah Hadassi, 'Eshkol ha-Kofer (Eupatoria, 1836), 27b. 34 In the continuation of this passage Halevi describes Aqiva as one "who had contact with [or made use of] the two worlds without any danger.

To be sure, the philosophical interpretation of this older motif is evident in the continuation of this very passage when Halevi describes the fate of another rabbi who entered the Pardes, Elisha ben Abuyah, as degrading the commandments "after contemplating the Intellects (n'jpy')." From this con- text, then, it may be concluded that Halevi identified the mystical Pardes with the realm of spiritual beings which are the immaterial Intellects. In yet another passage in the Kuzari (II:4), where the merging of ancient Jewish theosophy and contemporary philosophical terminology is evident as well, Halevi notes that the "spiritual forms" (ni'n'nK1 n1xK) are called the "glory of the Lord" (nmrr' t:) and, metaphorically, simply the Lord (mrr;).36 In that same passage we are told that the kavod refers to "spiritual forms" that "are formed from the subtle spiritual substance (,=mnl-fK 1't?,5 t.O3K) called the Holy Spirit (rvp;n nn)."

WOLFSON [14] source "whence the angels, which are spiritual beings (,n 5KK', rirmim'f),37 are created, and to which the spiritual souls (o=5NK nKi,aflKx), are conjoined."38 It has been suggested by Harry Wolfson that Halevi's concep- tion of a "subtle spiritual substance" which is acted upon by a ray of divine light reflects a Neoplatonic view, traceable to Plotinus himself, regarding the light (0o6)) that proceeds from the One and acts upon the intelligible (voqlz) or divine (Oeia) matter (i5Xl) or substance (ouiaa).39 It was Wolfson's opinion, 37 Cf. IV:3 where Halevi concludes that the word mal'akh can refer either to an entity created temporally from the subtle elements or to one of the incorruptible angels which may be further identified as the spiritual realities (f'lmKlhK) of which the philosophers speak. Halevi informs the reader that one is not obligated to reject or accept this philosophical position. Indeed, with respect to the angels seen by Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel, Halevi flatly states that "it cannot be decided if they were from that which is created or from the enduring spiritual forms." The identification of the angels as incorruptible spiritual beings or forms finds expression as well in the writings of Halevi's contemporary, Abraham ibn Ezra, who likewise uses the term Surot to refer to the angelic beings whom he further identifies as the separate intelligences.

Elsewhere (Kuzari, V:23) Halevi speaks of an aspect of the Ruah ha-Qodesh, which is continuously with every member of Israel in any geographic area, as the "spiritual hidden Presence" in contrast to the aspect of the Presence "revealed to the eye" exclusively in the land of Israel.

The second air, God's intermediary in creation, is identi- fied as the Throne, the biblical kavod and the rabbinic She- khinah or Holy Spirit. Out of this second air are produced the various forms that appear to the prophets, in a way analogous to Halevi's conception of the spiritual forms apprehended by the prophets being produced by the light of the Holy Spirit. The significant factor that Wolfson did not dwell upon is Halevi's indebtedness to older forms of Jewish mysticism. This indebt- edness is highlighted if one compares his notion of surot ruhaniyyot with the cognate notion in standard Neoplatonic works. To take one example from a key medieval Neoplatonic text that may have been an important source for Halevi, the Pseudo-Empedoclean Book of Five Substances. In that text one reads about an "intellectual vision" ('sn; nl';in) through which one can know the spiritual or intelligible forms (nr'rrt nilx nmrnM) which are the "impressions (or traces) of God" (m,ltn n",tIn)42 within the world of the Intellect (nt:Vr D5ly).43 These forms are akin to the Plotinian conception of intelligibles (TaC votra) within the second hypostasis, Nous, that make up the intelligible world (Koi6gSo vorjx6o). Yet, for Halevi, the spiritual forms are not simply the intelligible ideas within the mind of God; they assume the character of the entities known from the 40 Kaufmann, Geschichte der Attributenlehre, p. 183, n. 146. 41 Wolfson, Studies, p. 93. 42 Cf. Kuzari, 1:77, but there the divine traces of which Halevi speaks are in the physical world. 43 Cf. D.

The understanding of the kavod as comprising the entities of the chariot is affirmed as well by Halevi when he discusses the term kevod YHWH in IV:3. According to one opinion, the divine glory (m;lr 1tn:) is a "subtle body (rnt%Kt D0oK) which accomplishes the will of God, and assumes every form that God wills to make visible to the prophet," whereas, according to a second view, the glory refers to the "totality of angels and spiritual intermediaries: throne, chariot, firmament, ophanim, wheels, and other imperishable beings."45 In still another sense the terms "glory of the Lord," "Angelhood (mn: ) of the Lord,"46 and "Presence of the Lord," can be applied metaphori- cally to natural phenomena, as in the verse, 'the whole earth is full of His glory' (Isa. 6:3), to indicate the immanence of God.47 However, insofar as the third usage does not represent a distinct theory or doctrine of the kavod but merely accounts for one of its semantic applications, it may be concluded that reflected in Halevi's words are two differing conceptions of the kavod. It is 44 To an extent this is true of other Jewish Neoplatonists, most notably, Solomon ibn Gabirol, Abraham bar Hiyya, and Abraham ibn Ezra. 45 Kuzari, IV:3. 46 See below, n. 53. 47 Cf.

The connection of the glory with divine immanence is expressed especially in Halevi's interpretation of a passage in Sefer YeSirah where the seven double letters are said to correspond to the six directions and the holy Palace (wltjp hr:) in the middle. Concerning this seventh entity, the holy Palace, Halevi writes: "'Blessed be the glory of the Lord from His place (Ezek. 3:12),' He is the place of the world but the world is not His place [cf. Genesis Rabbah, 68:10]; this alludes to the divine matter (al-amr al-ilahi) which joins the opposites" (IV:25). Halevi's interpretation is apparently based on Saadya's commentary to Sefer Yesirah 2:3, ed. J. Kafih (Jerusalem, 1972), p. 80; cf. Judah ben Barzillai, Perush Sefer Yesirah, ed. S.J.

WOLFSON [16]</page><page sequence="17">[ 17] MERKAVAH TRADITIONS IN PHILOSOPHICAL GARB 195 generally assumed that the first view corresponds to the notion of the created glory, first formulated by Saadya Gaon (882- 942),48 and the second to the Karaite view as expressed, for instance, by Judah Hadassi (12th century) who identifies the kavod with the sum of angels and divine beings (sometimes referred to in the plural form kevodot) including the throne itself.49 In the opinion of several scholars Halevi accepted the validity of both views,50 though according to at least one traditional commentator, Israel ben Moses Halevi of Zamosc 48 Cf. Efros, Studies, p. 152, n. 50; Altmann, Studies, pp. 140-160. It should be noted that Altmann considered the Jewish mystical tradition of ma'aseh merkavah as a possible source for Saadya's doctrine of kavod nivra' See loc. cit., pp. 153-154. Altmann reached this conclusion on the basis of the fact that for Saadya the kavod is mentioned together with the throne and the attendant angels. It must be emphasized, however, that the very notion of a created glory, the central pillar of Saadya's theory of revelation, is not found in the ancient Jewish mystical tradition. Moreover, in other respects a tendency to transpose the earlier mystical ideas in a philosophical or scientific vein is discernible in Saadya's writings, as has been shown, for example, by H. Ben-Shammai, "Saadya's Goal in his Commentary on Sefer Ye4irah," in A Straight Path Studies in Medieval Philosophy and Culture: Essays in Honor of Arthur Hyman, ed. R. Link-Salinger (Washington, D.C., 1988), pp. 1-9. On the philosophical orientation of Saadya's commentary, see also G.

The Saadianic influence in the first view has been noted already by several scholars:52 the kavod or Shekhinah is a created light made visible to the prophets in multiple forms in order to substantiate the divine veracity of the revealed word. Prophetic visions, according to this position, are not visions of God at all, but rather of a created luminous substance called by a host of names culled from the Bible and rabbinic writings. Confirmation of this view is to be found in a previous part of IV:3, where Halevi writes that the intermediary through which the divine is revealed is called by various names, to wit, glory ('13n), Presence (nruw), Kingship (nlrr),53 fire and cloud, image and form, and appearance of the rainbow.54 All of these phe- 51 Cf. 'OsarNe/ mad ad Kuzari, IV:3, already noted by Lasker, op. cit., p. 115, n. 17. 52 Cf. Wolfson, Studies, 2:93; the studies of Efros and Altmann referred to in n. 48; Silman, Thinker and Seer, p. 178, n. 40. 53 At the end of IV:3, Halevi speaks of "the glory of God, the angelhood (tlKmn) of God, and the Shekhinah." Cf. II:7. Similar terminology can be detected in his poetry as well; see, e.g., Diwdn, 3:123 (poem no. 64): "And they will see your kingdom (inl:z) and by means of your messengership (lnlK'rngl) they will go." See ibid., p. 262 (poem no. 138) where shem, malkhut, and kavod are used interchangeably and are further identified as the light of God's countenance. And see ibid., p. 292 (poem no. 145), and 4:145 (poem no. 62). Cf. Wolfson, Studies, 2:86, n. 89; Efros, Studies, pp. 151-153. According to Efros, the confusion between the usage of these two words is explained by the fact that both terms derive from the Arabic conception of 'alam al-malakut, i.e., the changeless world of angels. There is an obvious similarity between Halevi's terminology and subsequent kabbalistic doctrine concerning the last sefirah which is called by the names kavod, Shekhinah, and malkhut. Cf. Joseph Albo, Sefer ha-'Iqqarim (Warsaw, 1877), 11:11. 54 Cf. Kuzari, II:26 where Halevi distinguishes between three kinds of light: the known revealed fire (fil,ruaK finKl,OX Xw'XK), the subtle hidden fire ('n r'iNX 196 ELLIOT R. WOLFSON [18]</page><page sequence="19">[19] MERKAVAH TRADITIONS IN PHILOSOPHICAL GARB 197 nomena "were proof that the [prophetic] word [or speech] came from God to those individuals [i.e., the prophets], and they called it the 'glory of the Lord' (;rnm 1123), and sometimes simply 'Lord' (m,r)." This formulation indeed bears a strong resem- blance to the doctrine of the created glory of Saadya Gaon who likewise maintained that the purpose of the visual appearance of the glory was to establish the ultimate authenticity of the divine word. Yet, some of the other comments made by Halevi suggest that he may have been reflecting an understanding of the kavod that is essentially at variance with Saadya's doctrine of the created glory. That is, the kavod is not a created entity that is manifest at given intervals of time, but is rather an incorruptible spiritual form - a "spark of divine light"55 - that can assume the diverse shapes of the entities that occupy the throne-world. These spiritual forms, in turn, express the tangible or visible manifestation of the divine reality which is per se incorporeal and invisible. The possible relation of Halevi's usage of the term "spiritual forms" to refer to the whole range of entities in the throne-world, to wit, the glory of God, the angels, the chariot, the firmament, the ophanim, and the wheels, and the occurrence of the term "holy forms" (nnwnp nrmns) in the Sefer ha-Bahir to refer to spiritual entities connected to the throne has been noted by Idel.56 Moreover, from a terminological standpoint it can be shown that Halevi's usage of kavod reflects rlK1 'toK), and the light of wisdom and knowledge (aKxKrIN' nrn 'n 11:). These three correspond to the burnt-offering altar, the altar of gold, and the candela- brum. In Halevi's own terms, the purpose of the three objects is to enable the person to cleave to each of the respective luminous entities. In the continuation of that passage Halevi adds yet another light which is manifest through the Urim and Tummim, viz., the light of prophecy (i1:a1l n3). 55 Kuzari, 11:8. Cf. ibid., II:50. 56 See Idel, New Perspectives, pp. 124-125. Another parallelism between an image in the Kuzari and Sefer ha-Bahir was noted by Scholem, Origins, pp. 78-79.</page><page sequence="20">198 ELLIOT R. WOLFSON [20] well the way that this term was used in the ancient Jewish mystical speculation. That is, in the texts that make up the Hekhalot corpus the word kavod functions as a generic name that embraces all the constituent elements in the heavenly realm that are visually apprehended by the mystic in his ecstatic ascent: the chariot, the celestial chambers, the different angelic hosts,57 the throne and the glory itself. From that perspective the word kavod is interchangeable with merkavah, so that it may be said that the one who has seen the chariot has seen the glory.58 Given this usage in Jewish mystical texts, as well as other Jewish literature influenced by the former, it seems to me necessary to qualify the generally accepted assumption that the second view of the kavod espoused by Halevi in IV:3 simply reflects the Karaite position. I do not mean to suggest that there is no similarity between Hadassi's understanding of the kavod and Halevi's description. The point that I wish to emphasize is that Halevi's own characterization of this second view, an alternative to the Saadianic one, is colored by the descriptions of the chariot known from the Jewish mystical literature which are, at least in part, exegetical elaborations of the relevant biblical material.59 Indeed, assuming that the second view refers to the Karaite notion, then I would suggest that what allowed Halevi to cite this position, and in fact to espouse a view quite similar to it in other contexts, is the proximity of it to what he 57 This semantic usage is attested, for example, in an early piyyut attributed to Yose ben Yose, published by E. Fleischer, QoveS 'al Yad 7 (1968): 70: "The beasts, the cherubim, and the holy seraphs [are] His glory, they shine and rejoice in glorifying His glorious name, D'InMt1 o'1;imT / 1lr1i3 umlp; W'2Irv 1 2,n1i nlnlm 58 Cf.

He did not, however, focus especially on the Jewish mystical tradition.</page><page sequence="21">[21] MERKAVAH TRADITIONS IN PHILOSOPHICAL GARB 199 considered to be the authentic merkavah tradition. That Halevi's understanding of the visual kavod is influenced by the Hekhalot texts is supported by the concluding remark of Kuzari, IV:3, wherein he notes that biblical anthropomorphisms and theophanies, e.g., Exod. 24:10 and Num. 12:8, as well as Ma'aseh Merkavah and even Shi'ur Qomah must be understood in light of the doctrine of kavod or Shekhinah. That is, that which Scripture refers to as the "God of Israel" or the "image of God" is identical with the visible glory of the Hekhalot text as well as the measurable Demiurge of the Shi'ur Qomah tradition. Halevi adds that the ethical-religious value of these visionary claims is to instill fear in the hearts of believers. It is clear, however, that the true significance of his position is the inter- pretation of both the prophetic and mystical traditions in light of his doctrine of kavod as comprising the spiritual forms of the chariot realm. The influence of merkavah imagery in Halevi's conception of the kavod can be seen from another vantage point as well. For Halevi the spiritual forms in the throne-world are not discrete entities but constitute one organic or anatomical unity visu- alized or imagined in the prophetic eye as an anthropos. In this regard it is of interest to consider the fact that in the throne speculation of the German Pietists the various beings that make up the chariot world are not discrete entities but rather consti- tute an organic unity. Thus, for example, in his commentary on Ezekiel's vision of the chariot Eleazar of Worms writes: "All the beasts, the ophanim and wheels are one body like branches of a tree."60 In another work, his voluminous commentary on the mystical aspects of the liturgy, Eleazar makes a similar point: "Zion and Jerusalem are close, all is one [just as] the beasts and wheels are one body, for the spirit of the beasts is in the wheels, and the beasts have four heads and one body."61 The position is 60 MS Paris 850, fol. 50a. 61 MS Paris 772, fol. 109b.</page><page sequence="22">stated even more precisely by the Castilian kabbalist of the second half of the thirteenth century, Moses of Burgos, a student of Jacob and Isaac ha-Kohen who were greatly influenced by the writings of Eleazar. In his Sefer ha-'Orah he notes: "The eight beasts, the eight chariots above the highest firmament, and the eight wheels of the chariot and the four ophanim of the chariot, are all set in one body."62 In other passages Eleazar maintains that the four beasts who bear the throne comprise one body which is likened to a cherub or an anthropos.63 Evidence for a similar tradition is to be found in the texts that derived from the independent group of Pietists, the IHug ha-Keruv ha-Meyuhad ("Circle of the Special Cherub").64 Without entering here into the complex intricacies of these different theosophies, suffice it to say that in the Ashkenazi merkavah speculation the chariot realm was viewed as one organic whole whose different parts were thought to be attached one to another like limbs of a human body. Indeed, the throne-world was imagined as an anthropomorphic body.65 I assume that this tradition, shared by the two Pietistic circles, was not innovated by either of them, but rather derives from a common source that has its roots in much older speculation on the chariot in Jewish esotericism. It is plausible that some such tradition influenced Halevi as well. That Halevi knew of and utilized such a tradition is evident in another passage in IV:3, which has been discussed most 62 MS JTS Mic. 1806, fol. 18a. 63 Cf. Sode Razaya', ed. I. Kamelhar (Bilgoraj, 1936), p. 33; Sode Razaya' ed. S. Weiss, p. 141; Farber, "The Concept of the Merkabah," pp. 424, 553. 64 Cf.

Halevi distinguishes two senses in which we can understand the anthropomorphic tendency to compare the Creator to a human being. On the one hand, there is the philosophic or rationalistic conception according to which the anthropomorphism is rooted in the comparison of God to the rational soul. That is, just as man, who is the microcosm, comprises a soul and body, so too the soul of the macrocosm (the world) is the divine being. In this very limited sense God is figuratively likened to a human. There is, however, an alterna- tive explanation, one that is based on a prophetic-visionary experience as contrasted to rational comprehension. Here it would be in order to cite Halevi's own language: Do not question that the image of man has been [attributed to the Creator]... For God is the spirit of the world, its soul and intellect, its life... Thus the image has been clarified according to the intellect. How much more so, according to prophecy, whose vision is greater than logic. The vision comprehends the upper multitude [i.e., the world of angels] directly and sees the host of heavens, the spiritual entities close [to God] and the other ones apart from them, in the image of man. These are alluded to in the verse, 'Let us make man in our image and likeness' (Gen. 1:26).66 Prophetic vision, in contrast to philosophic ratiocination, apprehends the multiplicity of spiritual entities which together comprise the form of an anthropos. Idel has argued that Halevi's account must be understood in light of an earlier merkavah tradition concerning the configuration of the world of angels as an anthropomorphic structure. Idel further suggested that the spiritual form which Halevi identified as the biblical God of Israel likewise must be understood in the context of this merkavah tradition. Hence, for Halevi, the "visible" glory of God is the totality of spiritual forms which together constitute the form of a human being. This anthropos, in turn, is the measurable being of the Shi'ur Qomah tradition, now under- 66 Kuzari, IV:3.</page><page sequence="24">stood not as the Godhead but as the totality of angelic beings that comprise the divine back. Indeed, according to Halevi, it is this vision of the chariot and angelic world which Moses wanted to attain in his request of God, 'Show me Thy glory' (Exod. 33:18). Moses was granted to see God's back, i.e., the "glory which prophetic vision alone can bear," but not the face which "no mortal creature has the power to endure." The back of the glory included those theophanic elements related in the chariot visions of the prophets and mystics. Again we see that the doctrine of kavod implied here must be distinguished from the Saadianic conception. For Saadya, the object of Shi'ur Qomah speculation was a created light apprehended only by the angels, distinct from the light apprehended by the prophets;67 for Halevi, the object of both prophetic and mystical visions, including therefore the measurable form in the Shi'ur Qomah tradition, is a spiritual form which is, in truth, multiple in its manifestations, comprising nothing less than the totality of the angelic realm that is visible to human beings through a special means of vision. The identification of the kavod as the back of the divine, which encompasses the angelic hosts of the chariot realm seen by the prophets, is implied as well in the following stanza from Halevi's poem, 'nvnK ' i K n} K:68 Imnlft DW nK BnD i 5im -: 3v nlz X2 una x v I.w nl7x K1 3 K171 &amp; voi Iplnln lnn nlX3 Il nJNn :'1117 nl'Kl 7y1 nixp inn 2 10 131xl1 iwy nD i'1131 l niz nw1w 7:y 5^n Iim3n X 'r 1Y3D D7H-I l Xi3 n to D 5yUn On 67 Cf.

This visible aspect is further characterized as comprising the camps of angels surrounding the chariot which are hidden from the eyes of all but the prophets. III Another aspect of Halevi's discussion of prophecy may also have its origin in Jewish speculation on the vision of the chariot. I refer to Halevi's claim that the spiritual forms can assume diverse shapes within the prophetic imagination - also identified by Halevi as the "inner" or "spiritual" eye and the heart (to be discussed more fully below) - which collectively express the tangible or visible manifestation of the divine 69 From the context it would appear that these "pure souls" are angelic beings; Cf. J. Schirmann, Hebrew Poetry in Spain and Provence, 2 vols. [Hebrew] (Jerusalem, 1961), 1:533, n. 20 (poem no. 237). It is possible, however, that this expression also refers to human souls which are bound to the throne in the angelic realm, a usage attested in other Andalusian poetry such as that of Solomon ibn Gabirol; cf. The Liturgical Poetry of Rabbi Yehuda Halevi, ed. D. Jarden [Hebrew], 4 vols. (Jerusalem, 1978-1986), 1:105, n. 20 (poem no. 36). 70 On the rhetorical use of the word n1Klln for eyes, see the example of Samuel ha-Nagid cited by A.

Micah 7:16. 72 Dfwdn, 3: 288 (poem no. 145).</page><page sequence="26">reality.73 The spiritual forms are thus configured symbolically within the prophet's imagination. In IV:3 Halevi informs the reader that the most perfect of forms (lux5K 5XK) apprehended by the inner eye of prophetic vision is that of the king or judge sitting on the throne ofjudgment. In his lengthy disputation on Sefer Ye$irah in IV:25 Halevi comments that the statement, 1xDo 5y 15ni a5lyn )n rnn5an i5n? wv m3 n 1n57 1 327 5w3 l (Sefer Ye$irah 6:2), refers to three symbolic depictions of the 'inyan ha-'elohi, for the teli symbolizes the intelligible world (5py5'K 'tK), the galgal the extended sphere of the sun (150 ODVK), and the lev the realm of animate beings (lKrn5K). The figurative expressions thus represent the providential role of the 'inyan ha-'elohi in each of the realms of being. What is most important for this discussion is the fact that for Halevi the cosmological role of the 'inyan ha-'elohi in the highest realm, that of the Intellects (= 'nr), is symbolized by the image of the king on the throne - the same image that serves as the highest form within the prophetic imagination. This point is reiterated in slightly different terms in one of Halevi's poems, =ltv ,r t^D1lX:74 Inr1w nut I*nKX 11'1'12 illIn'i 1n?rln bM V'n1 nlmKNll nlwln DW1 Innnn2n tP lnnN n,32n lX1n n'3n l=n XKmnl Dl 1'a? 1KM' Yt 1Y'Kl? pi When He desired his servant,75 In His tent He set His Presence76 He placed the visions for the prophets, To look upon His image;77 73 In IV:3 Halevi compares the prophet's vision of the spiritual forms to the aggadic tradition concerning Moses' vision of the heavenly Tabernacle before the building of the earthly one.

The image of God visualized in the prophet's eye is thus that of an exalted and elevated king, viz., the enthroned anthropos known from biblical theophanies and developed further in the chariot mysticism. The "eye of the prophet" is not simply a figurative expression but must be construed as a technical reference to the imaginative faculty which Halevi likewise designates in a key passage in Kuzari, IV:3 as the "inner" or "spiritual" eye.80 Here we would do well to pause to consider more care- fully Halevi's notion of prophetic vision and the specific role of imagination, for through such a consideration we can appreciate better Halevi's indebtedness to the merkavah tradi- tions, especially as they were interpreted in Geonic literature. Halevi rejects the standard medieval philosophic interpretation of prophecy as a state produced by the Active Intellect operating upon the human intellect and imagination.81 Thus in Kuzari, I:87 Halevi writes that according to Jewish belief "prophecy did not (as philosophers assume) burst forth in a pure soul, become united with the Active Intellect (also termed Holy Spirit82 or Gabriel), and be then inspired."83 Moreover, 78 Cf. Dfwdn, 3:5 (poem no. 4). 79 Cf. Ezek. 43:10. 80 Cf. Dfwdn, 3:75 (poem no. 38): 11'?O / ltnm' rK / rwl'K nmTn / rv'U irn. 81 Cf. Davidson, "The Active Intellect in the Cuzari," pp. 366-367. For the intellectual background of this view of prophecy, see F. Rahman, Prophecy in Islam: Philosophy and Orthodoxy (Chicago, 1958), pp. 30-91. 82 Halevi here is following a view expressed in both Alfarabi and Avicenna; see Efros, Studies, p. 142, n. 4. 83 See, by contrast, Kuzari, V:12 where Halevi presents a more straightfor- ward philosophic account of prophetic illumination arising from the conjunc- tion of the human intellect with the Universal Intellect ('5tK 5y3K: 5XxnK). In that passage the philosopher of Halevi's exposition represents the opinion of Avicenna; cf. Pines, "Shi'ite Terms and Conceptions," p. 211.</page><page sequence="28">206 ELLIOT R. WOLFSON [28] continues Halevi, Jews do not believe that "Moses had seen a vision in sleep, or that someone had spoken with him between sleeping and waking, so that he only heard the words in fancy [i.e., the imagination], but not with his ears, that he saw a phantom, and afterwards pretended that God had spoken with him." The implication of Halevi's rejection of the standard philosophic view is that from the Jewish perspective, as he presents it, the object of prophecy is a real entity, albeit spiritual in nature, that is apprehended by the individual.84 The content of prophecy does not result from the prophet's intellectual conjunction with the Active Intellect as mediated through his imaginative faculty; it is rather an objectively verifiable datum,85 although the means of verification may exceed the bounds of the normal processes of sense or intellection. For Halevi, that is, prophecy is more than a mere psychological state; it entails the same presumption of veridicality as normal sense experience, but in the case of prophecy the objective correlate of the vision is a spiritual form that, in the prophetic state, becomes tangible.86 Indeed, for Halevi, the fundamental 84 Cf. Davidson, "The Active Intellect in the Cuzari," pp. 389-390. See also C. Sirat, Les Theories des visions surnaturelles dans la pensee juive du moyen- dge (Leiden, 1969), pp. 86-87. With respect to this theme Halevi shares a basic orientation with theosophic kabbalists who similarly emphasize the "objective" pole of prophetic vision as opposed to the more psychologically- oriented explanation of the philosophers; see E. Wolfson, "The Hermeneutics of Visionary Experience: Revelation and Interpretation in the Zohar," Religion 18 (1988): 315; and idem, "The Secret of the Garment in Nahmanides," Da'at 24 (1989-90): XXV-XLIX. 85 See Rahman, Prophecy in Islam, p. 38, who draws a distinction between the views on prophecy of Alfarabi and Avicenna on the basis that the former, unlike the latter, tried to maintain the objective correlate for the pyschological state of prophecy. 86 Cf. Davidson, "The Active Intellect in the Cuzari," p. 389, who tries to uphold a distinction between the "tangibility" of the Shekhinah and its "corpo- reality." That is, according to Davidson, Halevi's view that the Shekhinah is the tangible aspect that provides the visible element in prophecy does not nec-</page><page sequence="29">[29] MERKAVAH TRADITIONS IN PHILOSOPHICAL GARB 207 paradox of prophetic revelation, that which the believing Jew cannot explain but must accept, is predicated on the fact that in the moment of prophecy the spiritual, incorporeal intention of God becomes tangible in both a visible and audible form known scripturally as the God of Israel.87 The means to ascertain this form are decidedly mental or spiritual, i.e., the prophet hears and sees in a way quite distinct from the physical senses.88 Halevi also contrasts prophetic vision with the process of rational insight or discursive reasoning.89 Thus, in IV:3, as I have already noted above, Halevi asserts that the prophets have an "inner eye" (,rY75 ufKlt ?K) or "spiritual eye" (fn'mnriK r;y,ty ) through which they see the spiritual forms.90 Halevi goes on to identify this "inner essarily entail that for him the Shekhinah is a physical body. It is clear that one of Halevi's main preoccupations is affirming the joining or conjunction of the incorporeal with the corporeal; see, e.g., Kuzari, 1:25, 68. 87 Cf. Kuzari, 1:89, IV: 17; Sirat, Les Theories des visions surnaturelles, p. 87. 88 Cf. Dfwdn, 3:288-289 (poem no. 145). 89 Cf. Kuzari, 1:95 where Halevi speaks of the divine faculty which is above the intellect, the attainment of which enables one to be conjoined with God and the spiritual entities. In such a state, moreover, one comprehends the intel- ligible truths without inquiry or study. In that context the imagination is not mentioned. 90 In a way strikingly close to Halevi, Abraham ibn Ezra in one place describes the angelic hosts that inhabit the third world as the "wonderful forms and awesome visions" (rniKt nllmttri nl' mKl nm'lX) which one beholds with the "inner eye" (1'3iP '1'y2) or "eye of the heart" (13' '1r'3:W1) as opposed to the physical eye.

On the use of the term surot in ibn Ezra, see above, n. 37. The motif of the eye of the heart is repeated often in ibn Ezra's poetry. See, e.g., The Religious Poems ofAbraham ibn Ezra, ed. I. Levin, 1:26 (poem no. 2), 67 (poem no. 38), 69 (poem no. 39), 97 (poem no. 54), 112 (poem no. 62), 120 (poem no. 66), i26 (poem no. 69), 480 (poem no. 243), 515 (poem no. 258). Cf. A.M.

Levin, 1:26 (poem no. 2, n. 3), 112 (poem no. 62, n. 4). That is, for ibn Ezra, in marked contrast to Halevi, the heart's eye is the rational faculty in a human being seemingly unrelated to the imagination. Thus, on occasion ibn Ezra uses the expression "eye of the intellect" (rwn ';Y) instead of "eye of the heart" (:,n l'y) indicating that the two terms have the same meaning. Cf. Levin, 2:449 (poem no. 404): 'hW r,37 lmtn. In numerous other poems of ibn Ezra it is evident that the heart (sometimes he uses the expression "splendor of the heart," ';i lp') is identical with reason which is the highest aspect of the human soul; see, e.g., Levin, 1:51 (poem no. 27), 110 (poem no. 61), 113-114 (poem no. 63), 125 (poem no. 68), 127 (poem no. 70), 462 (poem no. 237), 483 (poem no. 244); 2:180 (poem no. 309), 215 (poem no. 325), 220 (poem no. 327). This usage is reflected as well in ibn Ezra's biblical commentaries. See, e.g., Commentary to Gen 1:1 (ed. Weiser [Jerusalem, 1977], 1:12): na:'i pr n n n il2y: ... 2 Xlnpp nMlyrn on, nnvr 1p1 n? n:W'lin; Deut 6:5 (ed.

But [the prophetic state involves] the matter of separation [of the soul from the body] for he removes [from his mind] all [mundane] thoughts entirely. And the imaginative faculty in him, which is a faculty that derives from the elementary animal soul, prevents him from imagining or thinking about any matter pertaining to this world as if his soul left him. Then his imaginative faculty transforms his thoughts such that he imagines that he ascends to the upper worlds to the roots of his soul ... and the forms of all the lights will be strengthened in his thought as if he imagined and saw them as is the way of the imaginative faculty to imagine in his mind things of this world even though he does not [actually] see them.... Within his imaginative faculty these [spiritual] matters assume a corporeal form so that [the prophet] can comprehend them as if he actually saw them with the [physical] eye (;nlX ,XI'1 1iKtz '73' tg1 T;In 1 ,inn '1r W 1Yir ,n O:n,,yn i'trllD DW</page><page sequence="31">[31] MERKAVAH TRADITIONS IN PHILOSOPHICAL GARB 209 respect to the relationship of this imagination to reason, Halevi appears to espouse two opposite views. On the one hand, he seems to allot a secondary role to reason, for he states that reason brings proofs for that which the spiritual eye has already seen, presumably in a direct, intuitive way, a view found elsewhere in Halevi.93 On the other hand, he follows philo- sophic convention when he states explicitly in this very passage that the inner eye, the imaginative faculty, sees the spiritual forms only when "it is subject to the rational faculty," thereby implying that the imagination is secondary. From an examina- tion of other passages in the Kuzari, not to mention his poetry, it may be concluded that the former represents the opinion he accepts in the vast majority of instances. That is, the imagina- tion is the spiritual faculty through which one can discern that which is unavailable to reason. It is likely, as scholars have pointed out, that Halevi's conception of the inner eye is based on precedents in Islamic philosophy.94 Moreover, his identification of the faculty which apprehends incorporeal spiritual forms as the imagination (mutakhayyilah) can be traced to earlier philosophical discus- sions within the Neoplatonic tradition. A clear example of this can be found, for instance, in the Kitdb al-Ustuqussdt of Isaac Israeli (ca. 855-ca. 955). In Israeli's view the mechanics of wn?n T'Y).

On possible Sufi connections, see Kaufmann, Geschichte derAttributenlehre, pp. 177, n. 135, and 202, n. 180 where Halevi's conception of the inner eye is traced specifically to al-Ghazzali (see ibid., pp. 166, 220-221, n. 205, 232, n. 221); and Davidson, "The Active Intellect in the Cuzari," p. 367, n. 4.</page><page sequence="32">prophetic vision are as follows: during sleep the spiritual forms (nM'nrmni nrnlls), which are intermediate between corporeality and spirituality, are impressed upon the sensus communis which is itself intermediate between the corporeal sense of sight and the imagination proper (fantdsiya) which is said to reside in the anterior ventricle of the brain. The sensus communis then transmits these forms, clarified by the intellect, to the imaginative faculty which receives them in a more subtle way. "We mentioned that the forms with which intellect clarifies the spiritual forms are intermediate between corporeality and spir- ituality because they result from the imaginative representa- tions of the corporeal forms, and are more subtle, spiritual, and luminous than the latter, which are found in our waking state and are full of darkness and shells."95 The imaginative faculty transfers the images to the memory where they are stored. In a state of wakefulness the person seeks to comprehend the spir- itual meaning of these imaginative forms (rnin'l) through the cogitative faculty and will thus completely purify the forms of all vestiges of corporeality.96 From Israeli's description it is evident that the intellect plays a critical role in the production of these imaginative forms; indeed, it seems that the imagina- tion itself serves the rational soul, a point implied in Halevi's remarks as well. The intermediate role acorded to the imagina- tion between sense perception and reason can be traced back to Neoplatonic sources and ultimately goes back to some Aristote- lian ideas.97 The doctrine of "imaginative revelation" is found as well in the writings of Alfarabi (ca. 870-950) and taken over with some 95 A. Altmann and S.M. Ster, Isaac Israeli A Neoplatonic Philosopher of the Early Tenth Century (Oxford, 1958), p. 136. 96 Ibid., pp. 135-137. 97 As has been pointed out with respect to Alfarabi by R. Walzer, "Al- Farabi's Theory of Prophecy and Divination," in idem, Greek into Arabic Essays on Islamic Philosophy (Oxford, 1962), p. 211. See also Wolfson, Studies, 1:315-330; Altmann and Ster, op. cit., pp. 142-143; C. Sirat, A History of Jewish Philosophy in the Middle Ages (Cambridge, 1984), pp. 64-65. 210 ELLIOT R. WOLFSON [32]</page><page sequence="33">[33] MERKAVAH TRADITIONS IN PHILOSOPHICAL GARB 211 modification by Avicenna (980-1037). According to Alfarabi, the imaginative faculty has, in addition to the standard func- tions of retaining impressions of things apprehended by the physical senses and constructing new images on the basis of the sensory impressions, a third function consisting of the figura- tion of the intelligible forms received from the Active Intellect in terms of perceptual symbols. The symbolic images produced in the imagination in turn impress themselves upon the percep- tual faculty and the images are apprehended as sensible reali- ties.98 In similar fashion Avicenna distinguishes between two forms of prophetic experience, intellectual and imaginative: in the case of the former the universal intelligibles are received directly from the Active Intellect, whereas in the latter the prophet receives images from the celestial souls by means of his imagination.9 The key difference between the view of Alfarabi and Halevi is that the latter eliminates the role of the Active Intellect bestowing these intelligibles on the imagination. For Halevi the prophet looks directly into the spiritual forms which are experienced in corporeal terms within the imagination. In the context of IV:3, in marked contrast to some other sections of the Kuzari, lo the function which Halevi attributes to 98 See Walzer, "Al-Farabi's Theory of Prophecy and Divination," pp. 211- 216; Rahman, Prophecy in Islam, pp. 36-45; M.W. Ur-Rahman, "Al-Farabi and his Theory of Dreams," Islamic Culture 41 (1967): 149. 99 Cf. M.E. Marmura, "Avicenna's Psychological Proof of Prophecy," Journal of Near Eastern Studies 29 (1963): 51. 100 In V:12 Halevi, consciously portraying the philosophical view, depicts the common sense as the faculty that stores images of sensible objects after they have disappeared, whereas the imagination is described as "the faculty which combines all the images united in the common sense, and which separates them, and adds changes to them without removing at all the images of the common sense." Further on in the same section of the Kuzari Halevi notes that the highest function of the rational soul is such that the spiritual forms or intelligibles replace the images which the vital soul had formed by means of the imaginative faculty. Cf. 111:5. For the philosophical background of these passages, see Wolfson, Studies, 1:285-286.</page><page sequence="34">ELLIOT R. WOLFSON [34] the imaginative faculty is apprehension of that which is incor- poreal. A similar function is given in III:5 where Halevi de- scribes one of the stages of the pietistic life'?l as the exercise of the imaginative faculty to conjure images of certain major events and/or items stored in the memory, such as the attemp- ted sacrifice of Isaac, the Sinaitic theophany, the tabernacle of Moses, the sacrificial cult, the indwelling of the Presence in the Temple, in order "to represent figuratively the divine matter." According to that passage, the symbolization of the 'inyan ha-'elohi in concrete images occurs within the imagina- tive faculty, but those images are supplied to the imaginative faculty by the memory which retains select received traditions. In the case of IV:3 Halevi expresses the matter in somewhat different terms, asserting that the relation of the inner sense to the incorporeal entity is parallel to the relationship between the outer sense and the sensible (physical) object. To be sure, Halevi emphasizes that in gazing upon these spiritual forms with the inner eye the prophet sees forms appropriate to his nature and in accord with what he is accustomed. Conse- quently, when the prophet describes the visionary experience he uses corporeal attributes, such as the image of God as the king or judge sitting on the throne. The image is appropriate from the perspective of the seer but inappropriate from the perspective of that which is seen: the spiritual form is not in its essence an enthroned king but only appears as such in the mind of the prophet. Nevertheless, the experience is not purely subjective, for there is a correlation between the spiritual form and the mental image constituted within the imaginative con- sciousness of the people of Israel collectively (at Sinai) or the individual prophet. To take another example from a different domain that sheds light on Halevi's conception of prophetic vision. In 1:99 Halevi employs the midrashic motif that God showed Moses on Mount Sinai the prototype of the Tabernacle '01 See above, n. 17. 212</page><page sequence="35">[35] MERKAVAH TRADITIONS IN PHILOSOPHICAL GARB 213 and all its parts. According to Halevi this means that God showed these forms to Moses "in a spiritual manner and he made them physically." Similarly, continues Halevi, David had a spiritual vision of the First Temple and Ezekiel of the last. This spiritual vision is contrasted sharply with the natural capacities of estimation, syllogism and ratiocination. The criti- cal point is that spiritual vision - the act of imagination - has an object that is outside the mind, an object that is incorporeal but which assumes tangible shape within the particular im- agined form. While the Islamic influence on Halevi's notion of prophetic imagination is clear enough, I would like to suggest another possible source that has been less readily acknowledged, viz., the theory of prophecy and mystical vision of R. Hai ben Sherira (939-1038), the gaon of Pumbedita, as transmitted especially by R. Hananel ben Hushiel of Kairouan (d. 1055/56) and R. Nathan ben Yehiel of Rome (1035-ca. 11 10).102 In this context it is of importance to note that David Kaufmann suggested that Halevi's views regarding the distinctiveness of the Jewish people vis-a-vis the other nations in terms of their immediate knowledge of God based on revelatory experience and the historical truth of prophecy should be compared to similar ideas expressed by R. Nissim ben Jacob of Kairouan (ca. 960-1062).103 R. Nissim singles out the prophets of Israel and the Jewish people collectively (specifically at the Sinaitic the- ophany) as possessing certain knowledge of God through direct experience, whereas the other nations acquire this knowledge only indirectly through rational proofs and syllogistic reason- 102 The possibility that Halevi's notion of prophecy as mental vision was influenced by R. Hananel's commentary on B. Berakhot 6a was already noted by Even-Shmu'el in his translation of Sefer ha-Kuzari, p. 364. 103 See Kaufmann, Geschichte der Attributenlehre, pp. 167-168, n. 121; S.

Nissim, then, prophecy entails the immediacy of sentient experience and this alone constitutes necessary knowledge which is absolute and irrefu- table.'07 It is evident that Halevi shares much in common with 104 Cf. S. Poznanski, "Extracts from the Book Megillat Setarim of Rabbi Nissim ben Jacob of Kairouan" [Hebrew], Ha-$ofeh le-HIokhmat Yisra'el 5 (1921): 177-180. See also the fragment published by Abramson, op. cit., pp. 344-345. 105 See Abramson, op. cit., p. 344, who renders nwrinn as n'nn1KT (a priori). This rendering is totally unsatisfactory as it misses the very point ofR. Nissim's claim, i.e., apriori knowledge is prior to or independent of experience, and for R. Nissim, the superiority of prophecy consists precisely in the fact that it is firsthand knowledge of an empirical, indeed sensuous, nature. The latter is the force of the expression nmil';l ny', which is consistent with its usage in other medieval Hebrew philosophical texts. Cf. Kaufmann, Geschichte der Attribu- tenlehre, p. 167, n. 121, who accurately refers to R. Nissim's notion as "sinnlichen Wahrehmung." 106 The reading in the text published by Poznanski, op. cit., p. 180, D~y"K "'m:Y, is corrupt. I have corrected it to rngS1R DY5lx according to the emendation suggested by D. Kaufmann, Die Sinne (Leipzig, 1884), p. 56, n. 53. See also S. Abramson, op. cit., p. 193. The expression al-'ilm al-daruri is used by Saadya to refer to the third of the four sources of knowledge which he enumerates in the introduction to Kitdb al-Amdndt wa-al-I'tiqdddt (ed. J. Kafih [Jerusalem, 1970], p. 16), viz., inferential knowledge based on data supplied by the senses or reason. 107 To be sure, R. Nissim certainly denied that God possesses a body. What, then, is the object of this prophetic experience that is described as knowledge through the senses? In line with his Geonic predecessors, R. Nissim offered two possible explanations for passages that relate a visionary experience of the divine: either they are to be taken metaphorically or the object of the prophetic experience is in fact an angel which is a form created by God. Cf. Poznanski, op. cit., pp. 184-187.</page><page sequence="37">[37] MERKAVAH TRADITIONS IN PHILOSOPHICAL GARB 215 the views espoused by R. Nissim. Yet, in at least one fundamen- tal respect Halevi's description of the prophetic-mystical vision is closer to the position adopted by R. Hai, R. Hananel and R. Nathan. That is, for Halevi, as for these figures, the locus of the vision is the imagination, a point not developed by R. Nissim. It thus seems to me that Halevi's position represents a kind of synthesis, or merging, of the respective views of R. Hai (and those who elaborated on his doctrine, especially R. Hananel) and that of R. Nissim: on the one hand emphasis is placed on the heart as the spiritual organ of vision, while on the other the sensuous character of prophecy is underscored as the distinc- tive feature of the Jewish people. Insofar as Kaufmann has already duly noted the importance of R. Nissim for understand- ing Halevi's doctrine of prophecy, I will concentrate on the impact that R. Hai's interpretation of the chariot vision may have had on Halevi. The starting-point of our analysis is the claim that prophetic and mystical vision - they are treated as one by R. Hai and his followers'08 - is a vision of the heart, 3,n n'rw.109 It is clear from the relevant sources that the latter conception is based on the talmudic expression, "understanding of the heart," }nJ31K }*', utilized by the anonymous redactor in B. Megillah 24b to explain R. Judah's view on the nature of the vision of the 108 Cf. R. Hai's responsum concerning merkavah mystical praxis in 'Oar ha- Ge'onim to fagigah, ed. B. Lewin (Jerusalem, 1984), "Responsa," p. 15, where he argues against the view of R. Shmu'el ben Hofni that the vision and miracles are restricted to the prophets. According to Hai, the miracles performed by the righteous and the visions perceived by them are identical to those of the prophets. A polemic against the position of Hai can be found in Judah ben Barzillai, Perush Sefer Ye4irah, p. 22, where the author makes a clear distinc- tion between prophets and merkavah mystics on the grounds that the vision of the former (,K1Xln nflK) approximates an "actual seeing" (t,r nn,,1" O'ln3np) whereas that of the latter (n;l~n ,X n'"iKlr) is purely mental (X3'1 Kxnl331).

Hai's interpretation, the ecstatic ascent described in the Hekhalot texts consisted of a mental vision - contemplation of the heart - rather than a physical journey. This is implied, as Idel has argued,1' in R. Hai's famous responsum on mystical praxis from which I will cite only the most relevant part: "When one desires to see the chariot and to gaze upon the palaces of the angels above, he has various ways to accomplish this: he should fast for several days, place his head between his knees, and whisper to the ground songs and many explicit praises. Thus he will gaze inward and into the chambers [of his heart] (lr'tnlr lrrn '3 r ) as one who sees with his eyes the seven palaces, and he sees as one who enters from palace to palace.""2 R. Hai's view is transmitted as well by R. Nathan of Rome in his lexicon of the Talmud and Midrashim, the 'Arukh, who describes the descenders to the chariot as follows: "They did not ascend on high, but rather in the chambers of their heart they saw and contemplated ('imin l,al 7'' p71)113 as a person who sees and contemplates some- thing clearly with his eyes, and they heard and spoke with a seeing eye by means of the Holy Spirit" (lp1n;1 m'l: lbr rio ,y.). 114 10 Cf.

Hai interprets the mystical vision of the chariot with terms used in Leviticus Rabbah 1:3 to refer to prophecy: u,nlj;i nrim: 1ow Dt '3.115 The same attempt to understand the vision of merkavah mysticism in light of prophetic vision is to be found in R. Hananel's commentary on B. Hagigah 14b concerning the four who entered Pardes: "They did not ascend to heaven but they contemplated and saw by means of the understanding of the heart (Kx1 KHnn31:) as one who sees and looks through a speculum that does not shine.""' In this case R. Hananel has combined two rabbinic idioms, 'il Kfn=iK, which describes the chariot vision, and ,lrn ', n Kfv ,'9,DOK, which is used to describe prophetic experience.'17 The clearest application of this category to prophetic vision occurs in R. Hananel's com- mentary to B. Berakhot 6a and Yevamot 49b. In the case of the former, commenting on the aggadic statement that God wears phylacteries, R. Hananel writes: The Holy One, blessed be He, makes His glory visible to those who fear Him"8 and His pious ones through a comprehension of the heart ( nn5'i nrlm3:) in the image of an anthropos sitting, as it is written, 'I saw the Lord seated upon His throne, with all the host of heaven standing to His right and left' (I Kings 22:19), and it is written, 'I saw God sitting on the high and lofty throne and the skirts of His robe filled the Temple' (Isa. 6:1). [The glory appears] as one that has feet, as it is written, ['They saw the God of Israel] and under His feet there was the likeness of a pavement of sapphire' (Exod. 24:10)...

It is possible to say that one sees through a vision of the heart the image of the glory (11: nin') ... but not through an actual vision of the eye, for the verse states explicitly, 'When I spoke to the prophets ... and was imagined by the prophets19 (n;lt'lK O'Xn ::l '1) (Hosea 12:11). This teaches that [God] showed to every prophet an image (Ir'?v) that he could see.'20 The same point is reiterated in R. Hananel's commentary to the statement in B. Yevamot 49b to the effect that all the prophets gazed within the speculum that does not shine while Moses gazed within a speculum that shines: "All the prophets saw the glory from within the speculum that does not shine... And this is what is written, 'and was imagined by the prophets' ('nl ,rIN D,N331n) (Hosea 12: 1), i.e., the vision that they saw was an image (tl'i) and not the essential sight. Moses, our master, gazed upon the glory and the splendor of the Shekhinah (Tin ,nj,rtvr) through a speculum that shines from behind the splen- dor of the Shekhinah."121 While no definitive proof can be adduced to demonstrate conclusively that these sources influenced Halevi directly, the common elements at least make the suggestion plausible. For Halevi as well the mystical vision of the chariot approximates the prophetic experience, and both involve mental vision through images which is depicted further as a seeing by means of Ruah ha-Qodesh. In suggesting that the Geonic interpreta- tion of the merkavah texts is a possible source for Halevi's notion of internal vision or the imaginative seeing of the heart (the crucial term employed by Halevi in his poems as will be seen in detail below), I do not want to rule out the likelihood 19 I have rendered this verse in accordance with the interpretation of R. Hananel. 120 'Oar ha-Ge'onim to Berakhot, ed. B. Lewin (Jerusalem, 1984), Appendix, p. 3. 121 'Oar ha-Ge'onim to Yevamot, ed. B. Lewin (Jerusalem, 1984), "Responsa," pp. 123-124. 218 ELLIOT R.

Hai and R. Hananel were themselves influenced by Islamic thought in their interpretations of the merkavah tracts.124 In- deed, the role accorded the heart in the passages from R. Hai and R. Hananel is similar to the function of the heart (qalb) in Sufism as the seat of spiritual gnosis (ma'rifa) and internal vision (ba4ira).125 The Hebrew idiom used by R. Hananel in 122 See references to Kaufmann and Davidson given above, n. 94, and see below, nn. 133, 154, 170. It would be of particular interest to compare Halevi's notion of the heart, or inner eye, as the locus of the imaginative form of the divine glory - the most perfect shape being that of an anthropos - with the role of theophanic imagination and the creativity of the heart in the thought of Muhyi al-Din ibn al-'Arabi (1165-1240). For a detailed analysis of the latter, see H. Corbin, Creative Imagination in the Stfism of Ibn 'Arabi, trans. R. Manheim (Princeton, 1969), pp. 216-245. 123 Cf. Altmann, Studies, p. 145, and references given there to other scholarly literature in nn. 26-27. 124 The possibility that R. Hai's spiritualistic understanding of the vision of the chariot was influenced by Sufi mysticism (and particularly related to the function of the heart as the seat of mystical gnosis) was suggested by A. Jellinek, Beitrdge zur Geschichte der Kabbala (Leipzig, 1852), Zweites Heft, pp. 15-16, n. 22. See also P. Bloch, "Die ;n::'1ra 1ii, die Mystiker der Gaonenzeit und ihr Einfluss auf die Liturgie," Monatsschrift fur die Geschichte und Wissenschaft des Judentums 37 (1893): 69-72.

An interesting example of this approach, as noted already by Halperin, The Merkabah in Rabbinic Literature, pp. 174-175, n. 136, is found in Origen's First Homily on Ezekiel (J.P. Migne, Patrologiae Graeca, XIII [Paris, 1857], col. 675) where the exiles are said "to have contemplated with the eyes of the heart" (cordis oculis) that which the prophet "observed with the eyes of the flesh" (oculis carnis). For the possible Jewish background of this passage, which may provide evidence for a psychological interpretation of the chariot vision in ancient Judaism, see Halperin, "Origen, Ezekiel's Merkabah, and the Ascension of Moses," Church History 50 (1981): 273-274; idem, Faces of the Chariot, p. 335.

Hai who spoke of the mystic gazing into the chambers of his heart. Even if we bracket for a moment the possible influence of Sufism on the Geonic interpretation of the Hekhalot praxis, the likelihood that Sufism had an impact on Halevi's notion of the heart as a spiritual organ for vision - the term used on occasion in the Kuzari (cf. 11:24, 54)131 and frequently in his poetry which parallels the inner or spiritual eye mentioned in the former32 - should not be underestimated.'33 It is important here to recall as well that the expression "eye of the heart" ('in py,) is a common- place in Andalusian Hebrew poetry of the Golden Period (10th-12th centuries).'34 It is necessary to view Halevi, as any Tongue: The Semantics of Mystical Union in Islam," in Mystical Union and Monotheistic Faith, ed.

For other sources see Altmann, Studies, pp. 42-44 and references to scholarly literature in nn. 11-18. 13' It may be suggested that this understanding of the heart as the organ of spiritual vision underlies Halevi's famous analogy comparing Israel to the heart of the nations; cf. Kuzari, 11:36. As Halevi repeats over and over again, only Jews possess the divine matter which allows them to transcend the human species and become angelic or spiritual. 132 Cf.

Yet, I would argue that Halevi's particular use of these expressions is to be distinguished from what is found in the other sources.'35 For these poets, who embraced the general philosophical orien- tation of the Hispano-Arabic culture of their time, the heart's eye is the means to attain an intellectual seeing of God or other immaterial entities (such as the angels and the rational soul). That is to say, in the Islamic-Jewish Neoplatonic tradition the vision of the heart is an intellectual intuition of that which is incorporeal and thus invisible in a physical sense. The eye of the heart (*rl t'Y) is synonymous with the eye of the intellect (1' wn). A classical example of this is to be found in a passage from the Rasd'il of the Ikhwdn as-$afd', a tenth-century Neo- platonic text (possibly deriving from Isma'ili circles'36) which had a wide influence upon Muslim and Jewish writers in Arabic-speaking lands. According to the relevant passage the 180]; Moses ibn Ezra, Shire ha-Hol, ed. H. Brody, 2 vols.

In the latter case ibn Ezra refers to the inner eye of the intellect as the "eye of knowledge" (nyrn 71Y) which sees the "splendor of the glory." On the expression "eye of your intellect" ('lfu 1VY) in which one is said to conceive of the spiritual powers, cf. L. Dukes, "Extracts from the Book 'Arugat ha-Bosem of R. Moses ibn Ezra" [Hebrew], Zion II (1842): 121. For pertinent examples in the case of Abraham ibn Ezra, see above n. 90 and the reference to Habermann given there. 135 See, by contrast, Y. Razhabi, "Borrowed Elements in the Poems of Yehudah Halevi from Arabic Poetry and Philosophy" [Hebrew], Molad 5 (1975): 173, who treats Halevi's notion of internal vision performed by the heart's eye in terms of Arabic philosophical precedents (and Sufi texts in- fluenced thereby) without noting what I consider to be the key difference. 136 For a review of the scholarly discussion, see S.H. Nasr, An Introduction to Islamic Cosmological Doctrines (Boulder, 1978), pp. 25-40.</page><page sequence="45">[45] MERKAVAH TRADITIONS IN PHILOSOPHICAL GARB 223 believers, the sages, and the prophets are said to separate from the physical world and contemplate the spiritual world with the "eye of their hearts (Dm32'p l'y) and the light of their intellects (nlP,py 12)."137 The standard viewpoint is reflected succinctly by Maimonides in the following statement in the Mishneh Torah: "The forms which are incorporeal are not seen by the eye but rather they are known through the eye of the heart (2rn 7py), just as we know the Lord of everything without vision of the eye."'38 The eye of the heart is thus a figurative expression for the intellect by means of which one acquires knowledge (either discursively or intuitively) of that which is without body.139 It is precisely such a conception which underlies the usage of this term in Andalusian Hebrew poetry. This does not, however, accurately reflect the usage of Halevi, for the vision of the heart of which he speaks is not intellectual but rather imaginative, and the object that is seen is not the Neoplatonic form (or Aristotelian universal) but rather a spiritual entity that is constituted within the imagination (i.e., seen by the inner eye) as a tangible, almost sensuous, shape. Halevi, in contrast even to his Muslim predecessor, Abfi Hamid al-Ghazzali (1058- 137 Rasd'il, 4 vols. (Cairo, 1928), 4:141 (cited by Razhabi, "Borrowed Elements in the Poems of Yehudah Halevi," p. 173). 138 Yesode ha-Torah, 4:7 (also mentioned by Razhabi). 139 Cf. Maimorrides, Guide of the Perplexed, 1:4: From still other medieval sources it is evident that heart refers to the rational soul or the intellect, a usage related to, but divergent from, both biblical and rabbinic sources which treat the heart as the seat of thought and emotions. (The same connotations are implied in the Arabic lubb.) Of the many examples that could be cited I will mention one of the more striking ones, viz., Bahya ibn Paquda's Kitdb al-Hiddya ild Fard'id al-Qulub. The identification of the heart and the intellect is evident from the introduction (ed. J. Kafih [Jerusalem, 1973], p. 14) where Bahya describes knowledge ('ilm) as the "life of their hearts and light of their intellects (W'KIO1 D1nnnp? r,n'n Inhlpy5). Concerning this statement and parallels in other Arabic texts, cf. F. Rosenthal, Knowledge Triumphant: The Concept of Knowledge in Medieval Islam (Leiden, 1970), p. 321.

It seems likely to me that Halevi's identification of the heart or the inner eye as the imagination may indeed reflect the Geonic tradition recorded in the rabbinic materials discussed above. Specifically, the interpretation of prophetic experience and its application to merkavah mysticism that is found in Halevi has its precedent in the view espoused by Hai and those who elaborated his doctrine. These sources therefore must be seen as an important channel for Halevi, perhaps supplying him with the basis to appropriate and transpose the Sufi notions that parallel the ideas found in the Jewish texts. Scholars have tended to focus on the external influence without giving sufficient attention to the internal sources which may have 140 Cf. Kaufmann, Geschichte der Attributenlehre, pp. 119-140; idem, "Jeuda Halewi," pp. 123-124 (Hebrew translation, pp. 184-185). Cf. the criticism of Kaufmann's position in D. Neumark, Essays in Jewish Philosophy (Cincinnati, 1929), p. 227; J. Guttmann, Philosophies of Judaism (New York, 1964), p. 493, n. 137. For a more balanced approach to Halevi's relationship to al-Ghazzali, see D.H. Baneth, "Rabbi Judah Halevi and al-Ghazzali" [Hebrew], Kenesset 2 (1942): 311-329; J. Guttmann, "Religion and Knowledge in Medieval Thought and the Moder Period" [Hebrew], in idem, Religion and Knowledge (Jerusalem, 1955), pp. 21-23. 141 See Baneth, "Rabbi Judah Halevi and al-Ghazzali," p. 316, n. 4, who points out that for al-Ghazzali the heart is identified as the intellect or a power within the intellect; see ibid., pp. 323-324. Indeed, according to al-Ghazzali, soul (nafs), spirit (ru^), intellect ('aql), and heart (qalb) denote different states (ahwdl) of one spiritual entity (al-latifdh al-ruhdniyyah); cf. M.A. Sherif, Ghazali's Theory of Virtue (Albany, 1975), p. 25. By contrast, Guttmann, "Religion and Knowledge," p. 21, asserts that Halevi, like al-Ghazzali, distin- guishes between the heart as the seat of religious knowledge and the intellect. Cf. Kuzari, II:26, where Halevi speaks of the heart as the locus of the external and internal senses. In IV:3 Halevi speaks of the intellect being in the heart of the brain, but only in a metaphorical sense insofar as the intellect cannot be found in physical place.</page><page sequence="47">[47] MERKAVAH TRADITIONS IN PHILOSOPHICAL GARB 225 allowed for the assimilation, appropriation and transposition of foreign materials or concepts.142 Support for the claim that this Geonic interpretation of prophetic and mystical vision had a decisive influence on Halevi may be gathered especially from his religious poetry where he states on numerous occasions that the seeing of the glory is performed by the heart or the heart's eye which I take to be another way of describing the imagination. The first example is drawn from his poem, rn'yi li?uZ 'l2'ly. Let me note, parenthetically, that the word lr'yw in Halevi s poetry is often used synonymously with lW'n and therefore should be trans- lated in such instances as mental image or vision rather than rational thought or concept.143 Moreover, the use of the meta- 142 The question of the transposition or transmutation of one cultural- literary form into another is especially acute with respect to Halevi's poetic composition as it is for the Andalusian Hebrew poets in general. A typical account of this process is found in Razhabi, "Borrowed Elements in the Poems of Yehudah Halevi," p. 165, who thus describes the Jewish poet in Spain during the Golden Age: "In his soul there was no barrier between the Jewish culture and the secular culture, and at times there escaped from his pen, whether intentionally or not, foreign ideas and words." However, in many of the examples that Razhabi gives, especially in the case of Halevi, he shows that the ideas borrowed from Arabic texts resonated with ideas found in the traditional Jewish literature.

Thus, for example, in 11:24 Halevi offers the following interpretation of the verse, "I was asleep, but my heart was wakeful" (Song of Songs 5:2): "He [Solomon] designates the exile by the term sleep 144 and the continuance of prophecy among them by the wakefulness of the heart."'45 Halevi's exegesis of the expression "my heart was wakeful" turns upon the identification of the heart as the locus of prophetic vision. Halevi expresses the matter in the poem '1ry' ,l3yil 'lz: in the following way:'46 o3 r " lT /'i 1/1.K -nyl :l9tni 7Sn My heart has seen You147 And believes in You As if I had stood at Sinai; I have sought You in my visions,'48 (poem no. 169): 'l'n1tnl z 13'Y' 'flK1'T / 1rnltn '9yr '31'yr, It is important to note in this context that in medieval Hebrew philosophical terminology the word rl'Yi is generally used to translate the Arabic khatir which can denote either the compositive animal imagination (sometimes rendered as takhayyul) or the faculty of estimation or cogitation (wahm).

It is significant that here the poet's spiritual vision of God is likened to the prophetic theophany of the glory at Sinai; indeed, the poem is technically a reshut for the prayer of barkhu on the holiday of Pentecost which celebrates, according to rabbinic interpretation, the Sinaitic revelation.150 The ultimate purpose of the visionary arousal, i.e., the stirring of the heart to conjure an image of the divine, is to enable one to bless the name of the glory,151 as the poem itself ends: Similarly, in another reshut written for barkhu, the poet boldly declares about God:'52 nf3 nnxn Ku rSy nlmoi 1? l vnwpnl inK "rn 37 Vt!D3 He has an image which the eye does not see,153 Yet the soul in the heart discerns Him and gazes upon Him.

It should be noted that for Halevi the fulfillment of the traditional commandments is also a means, indeed the only legitimate means, for the people of Israel to attain an angelic state which is likened to prophecy. The key difference is that in the discussion of normative practice the visionary element is not central. Cf. Kuzari, I:79, 98; II:34, 48; V:20; Silman, Thinker and Seer, p. 182. On the relationship between the gradation of the angel and that of the prophet in Halevi, see the sources cited by Silman, op. cit., p. 251, n. 27. Other forms of pietistic behavior, especially song and dance, are likewise upheld by Halevi as means for cleaving to the divine matter; see Kuzari, II:50. With respect to these forms Halevi may have been influenced by Sufi sources which likewise emphasized dance as a means to induce mystical ecstasy. Cf. F. Meier, "Der Derwischtanz," Asiatische Studien 8 (1954): 107-136; M. Mole, "La dance exstatique en Islam," Sources orientales 6 (1963): 145-280; A. Schimmel, Mystical Dimensions of Islam (Chapel Hill, 1975), pp. 179-186. On the other hand, Halevi could have drawn from earlier Jewish sources as the use of dance in religious worship is attested in pre-Islamic Jewish texts including the Bible. Especially interesting is the statement in M. Sukkah 5:4 to the effect that the pious (ol'Onn) and the men of action (ntvynn u,rK) danced before the priests at the celebration of the water-drawing festival. For a discussion of these and other relevant sources, cf. A. Caquot, "Les danses sacr6es en Israel eta l'entour," Sources orientales 6 (1963): 121-143. 155 Cf.

Indeed, in the poem that begins '?;3n 2 ' ly;tn rD;nK, Halevi mentions the "tablets of my heart," ('21 nlmY') which are compared to the "tablets [of the Pact] which were inscribed on 157 Eccles. 3:19. 158 Dfwdn 3:204 (poem no. 113). 159 A play on Job 19:26: mLX ,nt 'nx'va?1. 160 Dfwdn 3:6 (poem no. 5). 161 Ibid., 4:201 (poem no. 97). 162 Ibid., 189 (poem no. 87). 163 Cf. ibid., 3:272 (poem no. 144): 35n n5n, / iu^'tn Tr1, 'n' lIn 'a; 288 (poem no. 145), cited above at n. 72. 164 Cf. ibid., 4:209 (poem no. 101): r'naltrnn :n T'y: / n:?

Exod. 32:1 5).166 The point of the poem, alluded to in the biblical phrase which serves as its prelude, m'l,K Iftl Mr "' (Job 19:26), is to emphasize the extent to which the locus of one's knowledge and vision of God is centered in one's own physical and spiritual being. Thus Halevi maintains that one can "see" God from one's spirit which is created from the spirit of God's mouth, from one's limbs which are formed by God's hands, and from the tablets of the heart which are likened to the tablets of the Pact, luhot ha-'edut, inscribed from both sides. In still another poem, 1 inx, nlnln,1'67 Halevi compares the heart of God's servants (n:: 1'"y) to the tablets upon which are carved the inerasable divine laws. In that context the heart which bears the imprint of the divine below is also compared to the throne that bears the glory above:'68 just as God dwells in the heart of the faithful, the faithful dwell alongside the throne of glory.'69 In Halevi's own words: 'lly o3u1 nlmi nlm51n y nippn riinn Ku, iK nlpn innp nws 11i1 n:alun o: n111 ' mnalnn 1r32301, nln31l nlntn mn by 166 Diwdn, 2:272 (poem no. 51). 167 Ibid., 3:67-68 (poem no. 35). 168 On the correlation of the heart and the throne, and the possible Sufi influence, see discussion below. The association of the tablets and the throne in Halevi may be derived as well from the aggadic tradition that the tablets were hewn from the sapphire stone of the throne or a quarry beneath the throne. For references see L. Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews, 8 vols. (Philadelphia, 1968), 6:49-50, n. 258, 59, nn. 305-306. 169 Cf. E.

This heart, moreover, is the inner eye or the imagination upon which are written the images - in the way that the commandments are inscribed on the tablets - from which one sees God or the divine form in a concrete, tangible manner.170 This imaging of the formless God is the ultimate goal - and challenge - of the poetic dwelling.7' To express the matter differently, the imaginative visualization of God for Halevi is a manner of expressing the sense of being filled with the immediacy of the divine presence - the 'inyan ha-'elohi - in one's heart.172 Thus in one of his poems, the baqashah which begins with the words 'ny,' r2 '1i nK 1':K, Halevi compares the "fear and trembling" of the process of poetic composition to various biblical accounts of visionary 170 It is possible that with respect to this image, luhot levavi, Halevi was influenced by a Sufi conception as found, for example, in the Ihyd ''ulum ad-din of al-Ghazzali, wherein the heart is said to reflect the truths contained in the Well-Guarded Tablet, al-lawh al-mah.fuz, mentioned in the Qu'ran 75:22 and identified in the mystical literature with the Active Intellect or the Universal Soul. Cf. Baneth, "Rabbi Judah Halevi and al-Ghazzali," p. 325, n. 2. For the influence of al-Ghazzali's passage on the Jewish Sufi, 'Obadyah Maimonides, see Fenton, The Treatise of the Pool, pp. 43, 71, n. 43, and text cited on p. 92: "When thou will have persevered in this effort, thine imaginative faculty will be purified and all that is graven on the 'well-guarded Tablet' will be manifest to thee." It is of interest that in this text the heart, which reflects what is written on the Well-Guarded Tablet, is also identified as the imaginative faculty, a point that concurs with what we have found in Halevi. 171 Cf. Dfwdn, 4:258 (poem no. 134): ;lin niK-'I 'bwln Inixt1 T' n' 3; 263 (poem no. 135): nl', ,: '3ln nPT IK / nlriK 0o: l''rn 'ry. Cf. ibid., 2:306 (poem no. 89).

Let me delight in the splendor of Your Presence, 'Awake, I am filled with [the vision] of Your image' (Ps. 17:15) In this context we again see a clear connection between the hasid and visionary experience of the image (nmjn) of God also referred to as the splendor of the Shekhinah. One of the essential images that informs this mental vision is that of the enthroned glory. The point is evident from the poem, *aV? nnrw1n :174 "NX t?;n tWnK 1: Dl' S:9y3 nlmNK n^y3 T: One day I sought if the Lord was present,175 For He transcends my physical sight; Returning to my heart and my thoughts176 I found Your throne as a witness, hidden within my recesses.

Insofar as the throne is the "quarry of the soul," in Halevi's language, it follows that the soul is the locus for the imaging of that throne.

Bowering, The Mystical Vision ofExistence in Classical Islam: The Qur'dnic Hermeneutics of the Sufi Sahl At-Tustarf (d. 283/896) (Berlin, 1980), pp. 163-164, 191-193, 239, 253; Ibn 'Ata' Allah, Traite sur le nom allah, introduction, translation, and notes by M.

The correlation of the throne and the heart seems to be implied as well in the statement of Abu Yazid al-Bistami (d. 874) cited by ibn al-'Arabi in his FuSut al-hikam (English translation by R.W.J. Austin, The Bezels of Wisdom [New York, 1980], p. 101): "If the Throne and all that surrounds it, multiplied a hundred million times, were to be in one of the many chambers of the Heart of the gnostic, he would not be aware of it."

He joins, indeed becomes one with, the angels and utters hymns before God, and ultimately has a vision of the divine form characterized as the resplendent light of the divine countenance.

From all the textual evidence that I have adduced, therefore, it may be concluded that the language and motifs of ancient Jewish mysticism were utilized by Halevi and set in his own Andalusian cultural milieu. Most impor- tantly, the description of the visionary experience of the mystic was considered to be, phenomenologically speaking, on par with prophecy and poetic inspiration. In all three cases the inner vision consisted of an imaging of an incorporeal light in corporeal forms within the imagination. IV At this juncture I will discuss another motif in Halevi that has great affinity with an idea expressed in Jewish esoteric sources, viz., the conception of prophecy as the apprehension of the divine name. 90 It is well-known that the names of God occupy a central place in the world of ancient Jewish speculation on the chariot.'9' Indeed, in the Hekhalot texts the nomina barbara assume both theosophical and magical-theurgical signifi- cance.'92 That is to say, on the one hand the names are said to reveal the nature of the divine essence, but, on the other, they serve as the principle means for the heavenly ascent to the throne as well as being an essential part of the hymns uttered by the angels and the mystic before the glory.193 These two func- tions cannot be separated for the effectiveness of the names as '90 On the relation of the name and prophecy, cf. The Religious Poems of Abraham ibn Ezra, 2:220 (poem no. 327). 191 Cf. K.E. Grozinger, "The Names of God and the Celestial Powers: Their Function and Meaning in the Hekhalot Literature," Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought 6 (1987): 53-70 (English section). 192 On the magical-theurgical significance of the divine names in the Hekhalot literature, cf. Scholem, Major Trends, p. 56; idem, Jewish Gnosticism, pp. 54-55, 75-83; I. Gruenwald, Apocalyptic and Merkavah Mysticism (Leiden, 1980), pp. 104-107. 193 Cf. Elior, "The Concept of God," pp. 17-18, 20-24.</page><page sequence="58">magical-theurgical means is linked to the operative belief that the names indicate something of the divine (or angelic) essence. Insofar as the name of God reflects the essence of God epitomized, for example, in the famous statement, "He is His name and His name is He"'94 - it follows that the knowledge of God granted to the mystic in his ascent to the throne and vision of the glory will consist of knowledge of the names.195 The "seeing of the king in his beauty" is, in effect, a mystical vision of the letters that make up the divine names. Although Halevi does not discuss the actual merkavah texts, it seems to me that his understanding of prophecy as the comprehension of the divine name is connected to this Jewish mystical tradition. Indeed, as will be seen further on in this section, Halevi on occasion employs precise terminology from the Hekhalot texts to characterize his conception of the name as a luminous substance. I will attempt to show that for Halevi the name is identical with the divine glory which is characterized as light. These associations are standard themes in ancient Jewish mys- tical literature that were expressed in both kabbalistic and Pietistic literature of the High Middle Ages. Before proceeding to a discussion of the mystical conception of the name in Halevi, it most be noted that evidence for the cultivation of such an idea is found in the writings of other medieval Jewish Neoplatonists. In this context I will mention three examples. In the poetry of Solomon ibn Gabirol (ca. 194 Schafer, Synopsis, ?588. Cf. G. Scholem, On the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism (New York, 1969), p. 44. 195 Cf. R. Elior, "Hekhalot Zutarti," Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought, Supplement I (1982): 5; idem, "The Concept of God," pp. 21-22. The mystical identification of the name and the glory is based on earlier traditions attested in the Bible itself. Thus the name is used as a substitute for the glory and assumes the characteristics applied to the latter as, for example, in the Deuteronomist's repeated claim that the name dwells in the Temple. Cf. Deut. 12:5, 11 , 21; 14:23, 24; 16:2, 6; 26:2. Interestingly, the targumic authors render the reference to God's name in these contexts as God's Presence, nr'n:rw. 236 ELLIOT R. WOLFSON [58]</page><page sequence="59">[59] MERKAVAH TRADITIONS IN PHILOSOPHICAL GARB 237 1020-ca. 1057) the name is identified as the power of the Creator manifest in being through the divine Will. 196 In Pseudo-Bahya's Kitdb Ma 'dnial-Nafs it is stated that the first of the entities that emanates from the One is called by the Greeks Active Intellect and by the Torah glory, Shekhinah, and the name.'97 Even closer to Halevi's formulation is Abraham ibn Ezra who speaks of the souls being conjoined to the angelic realm, i.e., the separate Intellects, and thereby they cleave to the glorious name, shem ha-nikhbad (the Tetragrammaton).'98 From these examples, and others that could have been cited, it is evident that Halevi's utilization of the ancient speculation concerning the name within a Neoplatonic context is not an isolated phenomenon but rather represents a discernible pat- tern in medieval Jewish Neoplatonism. In IV: 15 Halevi writes that in the moment of prophecy, when the prophet achieves a state of being separated from his bodily existence by "cleaving to the angelic species," he is cloaked in the Ruah ha-Qodesh (elsewhere described as aljism al-latifal- ruhdni, the subtle spiritual substance) and by means of a prophetic vision apprehends the Tetragrammaton.199 The latter, Halevi notes, "is the specific and definite name which instructs about the relation between God and His most perfect creatures on the face of the earth, viz., the prophets, whose souls are pure, and they receive the light which penetrates them like the light of sun in a crystal... The explicit name instructs about 196 Cf. A. Parnes, "The Mentioning of the Name in the Poetry of Solomon ibn Gabirol" [Hebrew], Kenesset 7 (1942): 280-293; I.

The matter of the Tetragrammaton cannot be comprehended by logic, and of it there is no proof except through prophetic vision (ismnK '131nK)."200 The prophet, cloaked in the light of the Ruah ha- Qodesh, apprehends the divine name which is a light that cleaves to the soul. This gnosis of the name, Halevi tells the reader in IV:3, can be attained only through "the evidence of prophecy (;'l:35K fin'tt,,K) and internal vision" (i1':rtK).201 Underlying Halevi's remarks is a decidedly mystical notion of the divine name which has its roots in the merkavah texts. Accordingly, one can find in Halevi a correlation between the Tetragrammaton, on the one hand, and the luminous substance of the kavod, on the other. This correlation is especially appar- ent in several of Halevi's poems. Thus, for example, in the poem, 1n ' onr,K iev', a retelling of the Sinaitic revelation in alphabetic acrostic, Halevi discusses the second com- mandment, "You shall not take the name in vain," in the following way: "Do not take in vain that which is hidden from His holy ones [i.e., the angels] ... the splendor of the glory of His name called upon the multitude ... kindling flames of fire"202 K1 nmy2t1 nn ... zrn?n by Ki7pi aD^n v? Tn ... rinp? r131 MIV1 xwn tx.203 In this case Halevi has characterized the name as a luminous substance by substituting the name for the voice of God which is described as kindling flames of fire in Ps. 29:7. Specifically, there is a connection made between hod and yaqar, terms designating the luminosity of the glory, and the name. In another poem, ',nK n ,rK n13n, the mystical conception of the name as a luminous Presence is evident as well:204 112 K1131 D1SK tlym lt D1TW nK 200 Cf. Efros, Studies, pp. 147-148. 201 Cf.

WOLFSON</page><page sequence="61">[61] MERKAVAH TRADITIONS IN PHILOSOPHICAL GARB 239 Bless the name - everlasting splenaor,205 awesome and terrible.206 At the conclusion of that very poem Halevi equates the divine name (1?n), Kingdom (1nl*'n) and glory (1il3), all of which are identified as the light of God's countenance.207 As we have seen above, in the Kuzari as well the terms rln1 and nli'5 (or nln5xn) both designate the visible form seen by prophets. On occasion Halevi describes his own state of ecstatic inspiration in terms appropriate to the state of prophecy, as for example in the poem "'1,, yll: 208 bnlfsy3 "nly '3*? nlewp His name is in me209 Like fire in my kidneys,210 Bound to my heart,21 Shut up in my bones.212 In the above poem Halevi obviously draws upon the prophet's description of God's word "like a raging fire in my heart, shut up in my bones" (Jer. 20:9). For Halevi, however, the subject is not the prophetic word of God, the divine speech, but rather the very name of God, presumably the Tetragrammaton. The first words, "His name is in me," n'lp intvl, echo the biblical passage describing the angel of the Lord: "for My name is in him," 'n 'D n3ip3 (Exod. 23:21). This very verse played a crucial role in ancient Jewish esotericism where it was read exegetically as a reference to Metatron also known as Yah ha-Qadan, for he was 205 Cf. Isa. 60:19. 206 Cf. Hab. 1:7. 207 Dfwdn, 3:262 (poem no. 138). 208 Ibid., 89 (poem no. 47). 209 Based on Exod. 23:21. 210 On the conjunction of kidney and heart, used to designate one's inwardness, cf. Ps. 26:2, 73:21. 211 Cf. Ps. 73:21. 212 Jer. 20:9.</page><page sequence="62">thought to have borne the Tetragrammaton within himself.213 Halevi combines this image from Exodus 23 with that of Jeremiah 20 to create the notion of the name being inscribed on his heart214 and innerparts like flames of fire. The name of God is itself the luminous substance that is within the poet. Thus, in another poem, Halevi writes:215 'lnSb IIK 1'I1 '7I Kiml 'Xin iyT' -'Ki ^1 KXll '73 IY .- lIl lYXK -'Xi Your name is before me, how can I walk alone? It is my beloved, how can I sit lonely? It is my lamp, how can my light go dim? How can I wander with it as a staff in my hand? Here the name of God is characterized in several ways which all tend to underscore the fact that it is a personalized dynamic entity, a point made as well by Halevi in the Kuzari (IV: 1, 3) when he states that the Tetragrammaton is the nomen proprium which designates the divine reality in its particularity and specificity as is the function of proper names. The first verse brings to mind the passage in Psalm 16:8, "I have set the Lord before me always." In the case of Halevi, however, it is the name of God that is set before him. This name is the constant companion of the poet, indeed his beloved, as well as his lamp, the ontic source of the poet's soul characterized as a light, and, finally, the staff which supports the poet in his earthly peregrinations. In a recent discussion of this poem Raymond 213 Cf. B. Sanhedrin 38b; I. Gruenwald, Re'uyot Yehezqel, in Temirin, vol. 1, ed. I. Weinstock (Jerusalem, 1972), p. 130, and see editor's n. 119; Schafer, Synopsis, ?387. 214 A similar notion is expressed, for instance, by the thirteenth-fourteenth- century kabbalist, Isaac of Acre, 'Osar .Hayyim, MS Guenzberg 775, fol. 54b: "The name of the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, is inscribed on the heart of the enlightened ones from Israel, the pure souls upon whom He dwells." 215 Dfwdn, 2:221 (poem no. 10). 240 [62] ELLIOT R. WOLFSON</page><page sequence="63">[63] MERKAVAH TRADITIONS IN PHILOSOPHICAL GARB 241 Scheindlin astutely observed: "This 'name of God' represents not merely the thought of God, but rather something divine that the poet feels to be an integral part of himself."216 Indeed, the name of God for Halevi is an hypostatic entity, identical with the glory, that is the ontological source of the soul of every Jew. The name is inscribed within the soul, for the soul is of the same substance as the name. Because of this consubstantiality the poet can be unified with the name. Thus in the poem, ly*; 1,i1 *:ln}K, Halevi boldly claims: "Cleave to the name of God, Your strength, and hold fast to it," tnX 1 i'lnl'x X trn py:1.217 In the moment of poetic composition, therefore, the poet, like the prophet, is cloaked in the Holy Spirit and apprehends the Tetragrammaton.218 The object of the vision described in some contexts as the anthropomorphic configuration of the spiritual form within the imagination is here characterized as the mystical apprehension of the name. In the final analysis, for Halevi the visible glory, the aspect of the Shekhinah "revealed to the eye," is identical with the divine name which is the light that emanates from the Holy Spirit, the "spiritual, hidden Shekhinah,"219 and which comprises the totality of spiritual forms known from chariot speculation.220 Reflected in Halevi's writings is an older doctrine concerning 216 Scheindlin, "Redemption of the Soul," p. 64. 217 Dfwdn, 3:88 (poem no. 46). 218 Cf. ibid., 261 (poem no. 138): nrm n h o t'rpm l p t17? nK... ':2. 219 Cf. Kuzari V:23, and discussion in Davidson, "The Active Intellect," p. 388. 220 It is of interest to note as well that approximately a century later, the Castilian kabbalist, R. Jacob ben Jacob ha-Kohen of Soria, reports in his Perush Mirkevet Yehezqel what appears to be an older Jewish mystical tradition that has great affinity with the views of Halevi: R. Jacob makes a distinction between an upper and lower glory, the former corresponding to the sefirot whereas the lower comprises the throne of glory, the encompassing electrum, seven sera- phim, the cloud of glory, and eight cherubim. Cf. R. Ya'aqov ha-Kohen, Perush Mirkevet Yehezqel, ed. A. Farber (M.A. thesis, Hebrew University, 1978), p. 8. See p. 96, n. 11, where Farber already notes the resemblance of this passage to Halevi's view. See also the article of Idel cited above, n. 29.</page><page sequence="64">the kavod that has its roots in the Jewish mystical tradition. To be sure, Halevi's philosophical formulation advances consid- erably beyond the more mythical presentation in the merkavah texts, but there can be no doubt regarding the direct influence of the latter upon the former. The 'God of Israel' as it is used in the merkavah literature refers to the manifest forms in the world of the throne that constitute the revealed aspects of the divine in the mystical vision. Halevi similarly maintains that the 'God of Israel' is a spiritual form, expressed in the shape of the various inhabitants of the throne-world that are apprehended in a prophetic vision. In one place, as I have indicated, Halevi even describes this prophetic vision in terms of a person's cleaving to the angelic species (i.e., one strips away one's body and becomes a purely spiritual entity), being cloaked in the Holy Spirit, and comprehending the most sacred of divine names, the Tetra- grammaton. While there is no exact parallel to Halevi's for- mulation in the merkavah texts, it can easily be shown that each of the critical elements has a basis in the early forms of Jewish mysticism. Central to the latter is a visionary ascent which leads to a temporary transformation of the human being into an angel; this transformation, moreover, is often described in terms of the mystic being surrounded or cloaked in the light of the kavod. Finally, the culminating stage in the ecstatic vision is a mystical apprehension of the divine names - many of which are various permutations of the Tetragrammaton - as they are correlated with limbs of the divine body. In the case of Halevi we have a striking example of a medieval Jewish intellectual who sought to incorporate early forms of Jewish mysticism in the texture of a more sophisticated philosophical approach largely indebted to Islamic influences, especially Sufi and Isma'ili thought. In great measure this tells the story of the literary profile of medieval Jewish mysticism which took shape in Provence and Northern .Spain. At the very least this study points again to the complicated interweaving of two of the threads of medieval Jewish intellectual history, philosophy and mysticism, which by no means are easily disentangled. 242 [64] ELLIOT R.
