<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Merciless Tragedy of Desire An Interpretation of H.C. Andersen's "Den lille Havfrue" Jorgen Dines Johansen Odcnsc University interest in "Den lille Havfrue," an interest I share with many readers and scholars, results from the tension between a powerful, almost heartbreaking representation of the merciless tragedy of earthly love and desire on the one hand and religious reparation on the other, a reparation many readers find both unconvincing and sentimental. Scholarly interest in the tale culminated in 1967 in a debate juxtaposing two interpretations, Soren Baggesen's Christian existentialist approach and Eigil Nyborg's Jungian reading (see Baggesen "Individuation eller frelse?" and "Replik," and Nyborg "Den indre linie" and "Psykologien"). Any subsequent interpretation must take these two readings into account. Although I find Baggesen's analysis a major contribution to our understanding of the tale, my interpretation nonetheless disagrees with his in terms of some funda- mental issues as well as with Nyborg's Jungian reading. I propose, therefore, to analyze the two main themes of "Den lille Havfrue": salvation through the acquisition of an immortal soul and human love. I will discuss the latter in greater depth than usual taking seriously the story of unhappy, unrequited erotic love. From the analysis of the place of love and sexuality in the story, a psychoanalytic interpretation will be attempted. Topography By virtue of its genre, "Den lille Havfrue" has both a heavily semanticized topography and a formidable narrative structure. The thematic values of the topography are established from the beginning. The opposition between land and sea is interpreted as an opposition between up (here)</page><page sequence="2">204 Scandinavian Studies and down (there). Notably, the little mermaid's grandmother calls the landccdenh0iereVerden"(I: 96) [the higherworld (65)]. 1Their respec- tive value is indisputable. This basic topographic-thematic division of the fictional universe is supplemented by two (or three) additional realms: that of air and heaven and that of the maelstrom leading down to the depths beneath the ocean floor, one of the places of final destruc- tion. In addition to this vertical division of the fictional universe, a horizontal one is based on the opposition between culture and nature. Nature, however, is divided into a positive cultivated space as opposed to a demonic and destructive one. In the sea, the merking's castle represents culture, the gardens of the princesses cultivated nature, and the territory of the sea witch demonic nature. On land, culture is represented by the castle and city and cultivated nature by fields and forests, whereas destructive nature is represented by the warm coun- tries where the heavy air of the plague rests (1: 106) and by the surface of the sea bordering the land. The sea is conceived as a destructive force of nature threatening the life of man. Furthermore, on land another vertical division is established between the surface of the land, the mountain top, and the depths of the sea. This division is thematically significant, because it topographically indicates the upward vs. down- ward movement so important to the story. Let us draw a diagram of the fictional universe: heaven/sun k yi I /' air k 00 yi Lff% /' ml depths of ocean / V J culture cultivated, positive demonic, nature destructive nature 1 All English translations of H.C.

The castle is the central social unit on land as well as on the sea floor. However, the church and temple- i.e. religious sanctuaries- are on the land whereas, the witch's demonic territory, a sphere of magic and destruction, is beneath the sea. The similarities and differences between land and sea are due to the double relation between the two realms : they are, at one and the same time, homologous and opposed to one an- other. Due to the basic anthropomorphism of the genre, the sea is constructed by analogy to the land. However, at the same time, the opposition of sea and land is basic. In spite of their specific homologies, they are conceived as culture vs. nature, and their social similarity is, therefore, counterbalanced by their fundamental religious opposition. The two upper realms of the universe manifest no divisions nor specifications of element. The air is literally an inter-space (and an inter- time, an interim) between earth and heaven, a space of transformation whose only function is to make the acquisition of a soul possible, thus to open the road to the kingdom of heaven. Heaven itself is, out of piety, not constructed by analogy to either land or sea. The twinkling stars and the sun represent a grandiose but vague sacrality. This topography is based on the ancient idea of the elements of nature: water, earth, air, and fire. In the fairy tale, fire is replaced by heaven, but the elemental relationship is retained. The sun, as a source of light and warmth, represents both fire and heaven as is traditional in Christianity. First Intentional Theme: The Acquisition of a Soul An intentional theme signifies a cluster of significations and often a narrative pattern to which the text and its narrator specifically call attention, pointing out to the reader its importance. Such a theme is also, beyond reasonable doubt, well-known and important to the au- thor himself. When Baggesen claims that the tale is planned with the salvation of the mermaid as the consistent outcome of the plot ("Indi-</page><page sequence="4">206 Scandinavian Studies viduation," 50), he is pointing to a narrative structure with a consciously intended end which gives this part of the plot its own finality. 2 The first intentional theme of "Den lille Havfrue" concerns the relationship between body and soul and the question of eternity as opposed to transitory time. Given the tale's Christian frame of refer- ence, it is no surprise that soul is related to eternity, while the body is transitory and perishable. Eternity is anthropomorphized as immortal- ity or eternal life and transitoriness as death understood as final destruction. In a traditional model of oppositions, we get the following combinatory diagram: I soul ^______ body IV II body soul III If we combine this model with the topography of the tale, we get the following combinatory diagram: earth (mankind) I soul . body heaven IV II sea (mermaid , | the blessed) ^ ^j- III air (daughters of the air) 2 The supposition of a level of intentional meanings in a fictional text seems unproblematic, even necessary. After all, intention is a integral factor in speech. Two caveats impose themselves, however. First, the intended meaning is obviously only a part of the text's meaning potential. Second, even if the author and his narrator(s) are well aware of the general thematic and narrative structures, they certainly are not necessarily conscious of the all the significations and relationships of the individual textual elements. The non- intentional significations of a text not only include the tricks played upon its author by what is repressed, but also the concrete ways in which intentional themes and narrative are realized (e.g. it would have been hard for Shakespeare to have been aware of the rich, specific phonological patterning of one of his sonnets).</page><page sequence="5">The Merciless Tragedy of Desire 207 The correlation between the basic thematic structure and the topogra- phy of the fictional universe confirms Baggesen's claim that the tale is conceived with the salvation of the little mermaid as the plot's denoue- ment. Furthermore, the vertical division of the universe also confirms this claim, because the protagonist ascends through the spheres from the bottom of the sea to the air with the prospect of ultimately reaching heaven. Second Intentional Theme: The Quest for Requited Love The first theme articulates the opposition of body and soul in relation to that between eternity/life and transitoriness/death. The second in- tentional theme relates the body-soul opposition to the theme of love portrayed as the opposition between the active and the passive. The basic opposition is, thus, between loving and being loved (non-reci- procity vs. reciprocity) : prince and princess to love to be loved the mermaid prince to be loved to love daughters of the air Although the literary figurations of this simple model are infinite, Andersen's originality nonetheless results in part from the ingenious way in which the two themes are combined as seen in the dialogue between the little mermaid and her grandmother. "Jeg skal altsaa dee ogflyde som Skumpaa Seen, ikke here Belg ernes Musik, see de deilige Blomster og den rede Sol! Kan jeg da slet intetgjere,for at vinde en evig Sjsl!"- "NeiF 'sagde den Gamle, akun naar et Menneske fik dig saa kj&amp;r, at du var ham meer, end Fader og Moder; naar han med hele sin Tanke og Kj&amp;rlighed hang ved dig, og lod Pmsten Ugge sin heire Haand i din med Lefte om Troskab her og i alEvighed, da fled hans Sjd over i ditLegeme og dufik ogsaa Deel iMenneskenes Lykke. Hangav dig Sjd og beholdt dog sin egen. Men det kan aldrig skeel Hvad der just er deiligt her i Havet, din</page><page sequence="6">208 Scandinavian Studies Fiskehale, finde de h&amp;sligt deroppe paa Jorden, deforstaae sig nu ikke bedre paa det, man maa der have to klodsede St0tter} som de kalde Been, for at v&amp;re smuk!" (I: 96) "I am going to die, become foam on the ocean, and never hear the music of the waves or see the flowers and the burning red sun. Can't I do anything to win an immortal soul!15' "No," said the old merwoman. "Only if a man should fall so much in love with you that you were dearer to him than his mother and father; and he cared so much for you that all his thoughts were of his love for you; and he let a priest take his right hand and put it in yours, while he promised to be eternally true to you, then his soul would flow into your body and you would be able to partake of human happiness. He can give you a soul and yet keep his own. But it will never happen. For that which we consider beautiful down here in the ocean, your fishtail, they find ugly up above, on earth. They have no sense; up there, you have to have two clumsy props, which they call legs, in order to be called beautiful." (66) To be loved by a human being, then, is the precondition for acquiring a soul. Baggesen compares this paragraph both to the marriage ritual and to Luke 14:26 and concludes that Andersen paraphrases the ritual, but in the passionate language of the Gospels, because, from a Christian point of view, the soul's salvation- i.e. everything- is at stake ("Indi- viduation" 55-6). The biblical references are beyond doubt, and the importance of the Christian understanding of the relationship between grace and salva- tion is not questioned. However, the idea that the salvation is dependent on the love of another human being is not a basic Christian, not to say Lutheran, doctrine. Rather the converse- salvation by virtue of acts of charitable love- is basic to the Gospels. This unorthodox idea, how- ever, is not developed at this point in the narrative. The reason for the marginality of the grandmother's point of view is of course that the despised and outcast may be saved as well. Indeed, according to certain passages in the Gospels, the outcast is even closer to the kingdom of heaven. To posit that conjugal and sexual love between man and woman as a precondition for access to the kingdom of heaven is, to say the least, highly unorthodox. By making the fulfilment and happiness of human love a precondition for the acquisition of heavenly love, Andersen establishes a continuity between the earthly and the sacred. However,</page><page sequence="7">The Merciless Tragedy of Desire 209 this condition for salvation- the acquisition of an immortal soul- claimed by the grandmother and the sea witch is not met. The plot, thus, explicitly disavows the allegedly inextricable relationship between the two themes. Plot and modalities Consistent with generic conventions, "Den lille Havfrue" has a rela- tively simple narrative structure. However, its simplicity is deceptive, because of the way in which the sequence of narrative modalities is made significant in the tale. The canonical sequence of modalities in the folktale, as analyzed by structuralist narratology, is as follows: being's /having's lack -&gt;will-&gt; knowledge -&gt; capability -&gt; doing -&gt; BEING'S/HAVING'S PLENTY Obviously, it is not mandatory that the modalities and action result in a transformation from lack to plenty, but most folktales follow the pattern. At the beginning of the tale, the little mermaid as a princess is integrated in the world of the merpeople. Nevertheless, she is called a strange child, and she has a vague yearning for human existence and love. These longings are represented by the way in which she has laid out her garden. . . . men den yngste gjorde sin ganske rund ligesom Solen, og havde kun Blomster, derskinnede rode som den. . . . vilde hun kun,foruden de rosenrode Blomster, som lignede Solen der hoit oppe, have en smuk Marmorstotte, en deilig Dreng var det hugget ud of den hvide, klare Steen og ved Stranding kommet ned paa Havbunden. Hun plantede ved Stetten en rosenwd Gmdepiil, den voxte herligt, og hang med sine friske grene udover den, ned mod den blaa Sandbund, hvor Skyggen viste sig violet og var i Bevsgelse, ligesom Grenene; det saae ud, som om Top og Bidder legede at kysse hinanden. (I: 88) . . . she [the youngest] wanted it to look like the sun; it was round and the crimson flowers did glow as though they were so many little suns.. . . she had only a marble statue of a boy in hers. It had been cut out stone that was almost transparently clear and had sunk to the bottom of the sea when the ship that had carried it was lost. Close to the statue she had planted a pink tree; it looked like a weeping willow. The tree was taller than the sculpture. Its long soft branches bent</page><page sequence="8">210 Scandinavian Studies towards the sand; it looked as if the top of the tree and its root wanted to kiss each other. (58) The vagueness of her longing is due to her lack of experience resulting from the prohibition against going up to the surface of the sea to encounter the human world. The prohibition itself sparks the desire for knowledge in all six princesses. The acquisition of this knowledge is determined by biological and social, not by individual, factors. On their fifteenth birthday, they are allowed to ascend to the surface of the sea, an area between two worlds and dangerous to both humans and the merpeople. The fifteenth birthday itself marks the passage from minor- ity to sexual and psychological maturity. As is typical in the folktale, important temporal and spatial passages are congruent. To the five elder sisters, the ascent and acquaintance with the human world of man are isolated events. They satisfy their curiosity but do not desire any further knowledge of mankind. They remain in their own element praising it to the sailors whom they attempt to draw down into the ocean. Thus, they are representatives of the traditional concept of mermaids as creatures of nature endowed with demonic sexuality. In contradistinction, the little mermaid's desire for knowledge is unquenchable, even before she is allowed to ascend herself. When she finally ascends, her meeting with the prince is decisive. As Baggesen points out, the little mermaid does, in fact, act against her mermaid nature when she rescues the prince from drowning, just as her constant longing for the earth is contrary to the nature of her species. At the same time, the rescue of the prince is the first of the three obligatory tests of the folktale hero, which the little mermaid passes (cf. Propp and Greimas). By means of this first test, which signifies self- conquest and self-denial, she acquires the modality of will. Now her desire is focused on a definite object, the prince. However, because they belong to different realms, the little mermaid lacks knowledge of the conditions of their union. While providing her with the requisite infor- mation, her grandmother tells her that such a union is impossible for physical and aesthetic reasons: to man the fishtail is appalling, indeed legs are mandatory. To cross the border separating sea and land means acquiring corporal and erotic attributes. Through the black magic of the sea witch, the possibility of physical transformation is realized giving the little mermaid the modality capa- bility. On the marble staircase of the castle, at the point of passage</page><page sequence="9">The Merciless Tragedy of Desire 211 between sea and land, the mermaid herself carries out her metamorpho- sis. To acquire this capability, the mermaid must voluntarily endure the second test. In the folktale, this would have been the principal test signifying the victory of the hero. In Andersen's tale, however, this test is a voluntary sacrifice resulting in a double self-mutilation. Although the mermaid undergoes the transformation allowing for her physical integration in the human sphere, she loses an attribute, essential to both merpeople and men, the voice and thus speech. Consequently, she is barred from communicating linguistically and dialogically with others, barred from the possibility of letting others know. Once again, the modalities of knowledge and capability are at stake, because the mermaid is reduced to a silent knowledge incapable of expression. Indeed, in a certain sense, she is worse off than ever, because mermaids lack the capability of crying. The ability to cry and speak not only means the capability of communicating feelings, thoughts, and knowledge to others, but also the capability of emotionally living through and acting out of inner conflicts. The mermaid is cut off from both. Her passage from sea to land has not made her situation any better. In the sea she was physically and socially integrated but psychically alienated. On land she is estranged because her muteness prevents her from sharing thoughts and emotions. And to this is added the physical pain caused by walking and dancing, by just touching the ground. At this stage, the possibility of integration exists, provided she wins the love of the prince. As the ultimate source of her integration, happiness, and salva- tion, the actions of the prince are crucial. He is at once the mermaid's object of love and the potential donor of himself and of an immortal soul. At this juncture, the prince's ignorance- his lack of knowledge- is decisive. When he is shipwrecked on his sixteenth birthday- at the critical transition from boy to adolescent- he is saved by the mermaid and unconscious when she brings him ashore: . . . detghzdedc bende, at bun bavdefrelst bans Liv, da ban balvded drev om paa Bolgernc, og bun Unkte paa, bvorfast bans Hoved bavde bvilet paa bendes Bryst, 00 bvor inderligt bun da kyssede bam; ban vidste slet intet derom, kunde ikke engang dromme om bende. (I: 95) . . . she was so glad that she had saved his life when she had found him, half dead, drifting on the waves. She remembered how his head rested</page><page sequence="10">212 Scandinavian Studies on her chest and with what passion she had kissed him. But he knew nothing about his rescue; he could not even dream about her. (65) "... kunde ikke engang dromme om hende" [ . . . could not even dream about her]. Andersen's wording is a stroke of genius, because it renders her totally alien to him, totally absent from his mind. To the ignorance of the prince, irony adds a tragic misapprehension: ... du ligner en ung Pigejeg engang saae, men vistnok aldrig mere finder. Jeg varpaa et Skib, som strandede, Belgerne dreve mig i Land ved et helligt Tempel, hvorflere unge Pigergjorde Tjeneste, denyngste derfandt mig ved Strandbredden og reddede mit Liv, jeg saae hende kun to Gange; hun var den eneste,jeg kunde elske i denne Verden, men du ligner hende, du nasten fortr&amp;nger hendes Billede i min Sjd, hun herer det hellige Tempel til, og derfor har mingode Lykke sendt mig dig, aldrig ville vi skilles!" (I: 102) . . . you look like a young girl I once saw, and will probably never see again. I was in a shipwreck. The waves carried my ashore, where the holy temple lay. Many young girls were in service there; one of them, the youngest of them all, found me on the beach and saved my life. I saw her only twice, but she is the only one I can love in this world; and you look like her. You almost make her picture disappear from my soul. She belongs to the holy temple, and, therefore, good fortune has sent you to me instead, and we shall never part. (72) This quid pro quo is decisive for the plot. Despite the fact that the narrator, the reader, and the mermaid know that she is the rescuer, the prince's apprehension is precisely the converse. Nevertheless, because the prince and the mermaid believe that the princess has taken holy orders and thus is lost as an object of love, the mermaid is allowed a humble dream: uPigen horer det hellige Tempel til, har han sagt, hun kommer aldrig ud i Verden, de modes ikke mere, jeg er hos ham, seer ham hver Dag, jeg vilpleie ham, elske ham, ojre ham mitLiv!" (I: 102) "He has said that the girl belongs to the holy temple and will never come out into the world, and they will never meet again. But I am with him and see him every day. I will take care of him, love him, and devote my life to him." (72) Here Andersen sketches a possible conclusion to the tale, a conclusion that would not give the mermaid an immortal soul but would portray her constant self-sacrificing devotion to the present but unattainable object of love. The expression "ofre ham mit Liv" [sacrifice my life for</page><page sequence="11">The Merciless Tragedy of Desire 213 him] is important, because the text indicates, how the actions of the heroine should be interpreted. The plot ends differently, however, because, just as the mermaid transcends the demonic sphere of nature, the princess returns from the realm of the sacred. For the prince their meeting becomes both recog- nition and fulfillment. He wants her, because he believes that he knows she is his rescuer. The mermaid seems doomed to die on their wedding morning, but through the sisters5 intervention and sacrifice the sea witch gives her both knowledge and power (capability) to return to the sea by sacrific- ing the prince. In the folktale, the third test is normally concerned with the modality of knowledge, namely the recognition by society of the protagonist as the one who has in fact accomplished the heroic task (i.e. returned victorious from the second test) and unmasked the imposter. In Andersen's tale, the third test is of quite a different kind. It must be noted, however, that with regard to the plot, Andersen's tale is so close to the folktale that structurally such an end would be possible. The conclusion might have been portrayed the prince learning the truth, understanding his self-deception, recognizing the mermaid as his res- cuer, repudiating the princess, and marrying the mermaid. In £CDen lille Havfrue" what matters is something quite different, so the modality of will is decisive in the outcome of the last test. Compared to the two previous tests, the third represents an ethical and existential radicalization which makes the problem of sacrifice even more acute. Now the choice is between destruction and self-destruction, between homicide and suicide. Since the mermaid knows the consequences and is fully in control, her self-denial becomes a voluntary choice of death. "And thereby she is saved," Baggesen comments, and pointing to Mark 8:35: "For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it." By losing her life, this one as well as the eternal, for the loved one, accord- ing to Baggesen, she receives grace precisely at the point where she seems furthest from it ("Individuation" 69). It is easy to agree with Baggesen on the relevance of the scriptural passage. Indeed, it is possible to understand both the universe and the plot of the tale as determined by the seeming contradiction involved in it. This may be illustrated by a simple model:</page><page sequence="12">214 Scandinavian Studies life death life of soul life of body death of soul death of body (Brask and Gradenwitz 1976) By adding the themes of existence and salvation as specifications of the model, we get: life death life of soul^Jifeof body death of soul death of body wordly existance perdition ultimate destruction salvation According to Brask and Gradenwitz, who used this model in another context, the two combinations Life of the Soul + Death of the Body: salvation and Death of the Soul + Life of the Body: perdition are examples of contradictions, because when two specifications of a hier- archically higher opposition are united in one element, a paradox is created which requires an existential choice. The mermaid, however, does not even have a choice between Perdition and Salvation, but only between self-denial and ultimate destruction on the one hand, and destruction of the object of love and self-preservation on the other. The grace of God is not known to her. The decisive question, thus, is whether this final shift from salvation through the erotic love of a fellow being to salvation through God's grace subverts the unity of the text such that the conclusion of the tale seems superimposed. Like Baggesen I do not think so. But before arguing this point, it is necessary to return to the theme of erotic love. From the Intentional to the Unconscious3 In this tale, it seems evident that the opposition between loving and being loved is intentional, indeed tragically clear to Andersen, while some of the ramifications of erotic love, which are evoked by the text, were unknown to him. 3 First it should be stressed that what is conscious and unconscious to the author is difficult to decide. Very often we can only offer an educated guess, but we will never reach absolute certainty. We can, however, make explicit the reasons for our interpretations and</page><page sequence="13">The Merciless Tragedy of Desire 215 The absolute demand for love, for being loved, seems present in the human mind from the beginning but changes with the development of the psyche. At first it manifests itself as an unarticulated demand for the satisfaction of needs but later is transformed into a desire for the other. This desire is, in the last analysis, a desire for the desire of the other. Finally, with the acquisition of language, the subject is able to ask for love, but at the same time prevented from asking for precisely that which it desires, because such desires are repressed, suppressed, and ineffable. The problem of the tale is that the other's desire cannot be taken for granted, even when it is our own conscious or unconscious desire. ccAf enfremmedMagtafhsengerhendesevigeTilvcerelse55 (1: 106) ["Obtain- ing eternal life depends on others" (76)], say the daughters of the air to the little mermaid. The mermaid, however, has one specific handicap: she belongs to an alien species, indeed, the characteristic attribute of her species- the fishtail- is hideous to man. Generally, mermaids are hu- man above the waist and animal below. The fishtail represents their animality, and men shrink away from their lower, animal nature. An- other reason for man's loathing of mermaids is that they seduce and lure men into the sea. To man mermaids represent seduction, animality, and death. To be accepted by man- i.e. the prince- the little mermaid must negate these three attributes; indeed, she must transform them into precisely their converse. The transformation from death to life is accomplished as she saves the prince from drowning. The text provides two reasons for this rescue: her love for the prince and her striving toward the higher world. The rescue is also an expression of Andersen's conviction that it is possible, at least for the elect, to transcend origin, nature, and condi- tions and that it is possible through self-denying love to serve life instead of death. These ideas are axiomatic to the tale. Even with the help of the sea witch, the negation and transformation of the remaining two attributes is complicated and highly problematic, particularly that of the fishtail which involves an unnecessary and highly undesirable change of seductiveness and sexuality. offer whatever evidence we have. And, whether the author was absolutely clear about the implications of his text, has had a presentiment, or was totally ignorant thereof is not that important, because the answer often will be that he has had a foreboding but has not necessarily sounded the depths of his own unconscious, although he has certainly expressed them.</page><page sequence="14">216 Scandinavian Studies Before a discussion of these transformations, however, the sea witch and her domain should be analyzed. The road to her house runs be- tween the grinding maelstroms, over the bubbling mud, and through the strange forest. The latter is described as follows: Alle Tmer og Buske rare Polyper, halv Dyr og halv Plante, de scute ud&gt; som hundredhovede Slander, der voxte ud of Jorden; alle Grene vare lange slimedeArme, med Pingre som smidige Orme, og Leedfor Leed bevagede de sigfra Roden til denyderste Spidse. Alt hvad de i Havet kundegribefatpaa, snoede de sigfast om oggav aldrig mere Slippaa. . . . [HunJJbi saa afsted, som Fisken kan flyve gjennem Vandet, ind imellem de h&amp;slige Polyper, der strakte deres smidige Arme og Pingre efter hende. Hun sane, hvor hver of dem havde noget, den havde grebet, hundrede smaae Arme holdt det, som st&amp;rkejernbaand. Mennesker, som vare omkomnepaa S0en og sjunkne dybt derned, tittedey som hvide Beenrade frem i Polypernes Arme. Skibsroer og Kister holdte defast, Skeletter afLanddyr og en lille Havfrue, som de havde fanget og qvalt, det var hende n&amp;sten detforskmkkeligste. (I: 98) The bushes and trees were gigantic polyps that were half plant and half animal. They looked like snakes with hundreds of heads, but they grew out the ground. There branches were long slimy arms, and they had fingers as supple as worms; every limb was in constant motion from the root to the outmost point. Everything they could reach they grasped, and never let go of again. . . . ... [S]he flew through the water as fast as the swiftest fish. The ugly polyps stretched out their arms and their fingers tried to grasp her. She noticed that every one of them was holding, as tightly as iron bands, onto something it had caught. Drowned human beings peeped out as white skeletons among the polyps' arms. There were sea chests, rud- ders of ships, skeletons of land animals; and then she saw a poor little mermaid who had been caught and strangled; and this sight was to her the most horrible. (67-8) Obviously, death and destruction are underlying characteristics of this demonic region, but the sexual imagery is more compelling. The mael- stroms that, C£hvirvlede rundt og rev alt, hvad de fik fat paa, med sig ned i Dybet" (I: 97) ["twisted and turned: grinding, tearing, and sucking anything that came within its reach down into its depths55 (67)] are a notable topographic addition to the sea world, because they are depths within depths and make it possible even for merpeople to be whirled down into a deadly hole. From a psychoanalytical point of view, being sucked down into a hole is a figuration of destructive female sexuality, the devouring mouth/womb of the mother. The warm, bubbling mud</page><page sequence="15">The Merciless Tragedy of Desire 217 signifies the realm of faecality. The slimy and strangling snakelike polyps are a powerful expression of destructive male sexuality; even more significantly the mermaid sees her alter ego strangled by male sexuality. Nevertheless, when the sea witch appears, it becomes evident that destructive male sexuality is inferior to that of the female: Nu kom hun til en stor slimet Finds i Skoven, hvor store, fede Vandsnoge baltrede sig og viste deres stygge hvidgule Bug. ... De h&amp;sligefede Vandsnoge kaldte hun sine smaae Kyllinger og lod dem vdte sig pan hendes store, svampede Bryst. (I: 98) At last she came to a great, slimy, open place in the middle of the forest. Big fat eels played in the mud, showing their ugly yellow stomachs. . . . The ugly eels she called her little chicken, and held them close to her spongy chest. (68) If we add the facts that the witch scrubs the pot ccmed Snogene, som hun bandt i Knude" (I: 100) ["with eels, which she had made into a whisk" (69)] and that her potion has the power to splinter the polyps into a thousand pieces, her symbolic value becomes evident.4To inter- pret the sea witch as a representation of the phallic, castrating mother accords with her role and function in the tale. With her help and because of her demand, the mermaid is subjected to a double mutilation: first that wished for by the mermaid, the severing of her fishtail into two legs. According to the surface logic of the tale, the division is necessary, because two-leggedness is an attribute of the human species, and legs are a prerequisite for being beautiful. (See Plato's TToAl tlkoc where he speaks of human beings as 8171050^ dyeing 276 c.) This surface logic should not let us forget that the division of the tail, which makes the mermaid human, at the same time opens the sexual locus between her legs. Thus, the severing transforms her not only into a human being but also a woman. 4 Indeed, it is amazing how many attributes Andersen's portrait of the sea witch share with the Gorgon of which Freud has given an exemplary interpretation. He writes: "According to Abraham (1922) a spider in dreams is a symbol of the mother, but of the phallic mother, of whom we are afraid; so that the fear of spiders expresses dread of mother-incest and horror of the the female genitals. You know, perhaps, that the mythological creation, Medusa's head can be traced back to the same motif of fright at castration" (XXII: 24). In a short note, "Medusa's Head" (1922), Freud stresses the fear of castration at the sight of the female genitals. Concerning her snake hair, he writes: "It is a remarkable fact that, however frightening they [the snakes] may be in themselves, they nevertheless serve as a mitigation of the horror, for they replace the penis, the absence of which is the cause of the horror" (XVIII: 273).</page><page sequence="16">218 Scandinavian Studies Da Solen skinnede hen over Soen, vaagnede hun op, og hunfolte en sviende Smerte, men ligefor hende stod den deilige unge Prinds, hanfastede sine kulsorte 0inepaa hende, saa hun slog sine ned og saae, at hendes Fiskehale var borte, og at hun havde de nydeligste smaae, hvide Been, nogen lille Pige kunde have, men hun varganske nogen, derforsvobte hun sig ind i sit store, langeHaar. (I: ioo) When the sun's rays touched the sea she woke and felt a burning pain; but the young prince stood in front of her and looked at her with his coal-black eyes. She looked downward and saw then that she no longer had a fishtail but the most beautiful, little, slender legs that any girl could wish for. She was naked; and therefore she took her long hair and covered herself with it. (70) Baggesen interprets this passage as an allusion to Eve after the Fall. [W]e have to maintain that the mermaid has not fallen from the state of innocence like Eve. . . . However, since the tale lets the mermaid start her course as a human being in the same situation as Eve after the Fall, it must signify that being human means being like Eve, and this means being dependent on redemption by the grace of Jesus Christ.... It is this grace that is the subject of the tale. ("Individuation" 65-6, my trans.) In the literal sense, Baggesen is obviously correct in claiming that the mermaid has not sinned. If, however, we read the passage in the context of another from the beginning of the tale, an interesting contrast emerges. I en lille Bugt trafhun en heel Flok smaae Menneskebom; ganske nogne lob de og plaskede i Vandet, hun vilde lege med dem, men de lobe forskmkkede deres Vei. (I: 90) In a little bay, she [the third of the sisters] had come upon some naked children who were playing and splashing in the water. She had wanted to join them, but when they saw her they got frightened and ran away. (60) Notably the Danish text reads "ganske nogne ," and these completely naked children think nothing of their nakedness and do not try to hide it. The mermaid, on the other hand, sees that she is naked and conceals her body from the gaze of the prince. Consequently, even if she has herself committed no sin, she has, nonetheless, acquired knowledge that the adult human world is gendered and together with this aware- ness a sense of shame and chastity. In other words, even though not tainted by guilt, she is nonetheless no longer innocent, because she feels</page><page sequence="17">The Merciless Tragedy of Desire 219 the insisting presence of her sex together with the social and ideological taboos directed against it. These are sufficient to create a psychological split and a sense of guilt in the subject. Thus, the first part of her transformation consists literally in the laying bare of her sex. The second part, the sea witch's price, is the cutting of her tongue. On the surface, the excision is given a twofold explanation: the witch wants the wonderful voice of the mermaid for herself, and secondly, she wants to make it difficult for the mermaid to capture the love of the prince. The mermaid protests, however: ccMen naar du tager min Stemmed sagde den lille Havfrue, "hvad beholder je£ da tilbage?" "Din deilige Skikkelse" sagde Hexen, "din sv&amp;vende Gang og dine talende 0iney meddem kan du nok bedaare etMenneskehjerte. Naa, hardu tabtModetl mkfrem din lille Tunge, saa skjarerjeg den af, i Betaling, og du skalfaae den kmftige Drik!v (I: 99-100) "But if you take my voice," said the little mermaid, "what will I have left?" "Your beautiful body," said the witch. "Your graceful walk and your lovely eyes. Speak with them and you will be able to capture a human heart. Have you lost your courage? Stick out your little tongue, and let me cut it off in payment, and you shall have the potion. (69) Baggesen claims that the voice of the mermaid belongs to the sphere of erotic seduction. Therefore, he surmises, the mermaid has to lose this means of catching the prince, because their love must be pure. This seductive kind of erotic love would ultimately cause them both to perish (cf. "Individuation" 67). I question this interpretation for several reasons. First, the sea witch may very well be right in claiming that body, gait, and eyes are sufficient to seduce a human heart and a dancer's erotic appeal is no less than a singer's. Second, this interpretation overlooks the fact that the sacrifice is a mutilation which reduces the mermaid to an object deprived of the possibility of vindicating her subjectivity through the expression of her own desire. Consequently, others may interpret her emotional expres- sions as they like. If we also consider the symbolic meaning of the demonic sphere of nature and the witch as the phallic castrating mother, then a latent signification of the excision of the tongue becomes apparent: a sym-</page><page sequence="18">220 Scandinavian Studies bolic castration. The biography of Andersen, his problematic relation- ship with both parents, and his lost dreams of becoming a singer, inter alia, also suggest such a reading. There is no doubt whatsoever that for both reader and author the mermaid is the figure of identification in the tale, and she is female.5 Nevertheless, the sex given to her in the story may well be contested and contradicted on other levels of the text to the extent that she also becomes the vehicle of a primarily male conflict. This interpretation explains the diabolic dialectics of the transformation effectuated by the sea witch: on the one hand, the sex is laid bare, on the other, the mermaid is robbed of her sexuality and thus neutered.6 This metamorphosis replicates the one she experienced on her fif- teenth birthday. At the hand of the sea witch, she has to reexperience the transition from childhood to maidenhood. Although her first passage 5 Cf. note 7. 6 Two objections to the psychoanalytical interpretation of literary text invite comment. The first is accusation that this analysis breaks up the coherence of the textual elements in order to relate them to each other in ways other than at the text's surface, and that psychoanalysis assigns some of them a priviledged symbolic significance. Here, such an accusation could be that this interpretation does not respect something which, at the face of it, is basic, namely the sex of the fictional protagonist, the mermaid. Certainly, this is true because castration, which in my opinion is absolutely central to the text, matters more to the boy than to the girl. However, who has ever promised us the total coherence of a fictional text? Indeed, it is naive to presuppose it, if we acknowledge that literature is produced by the interplay of opposition between conscious and unconscious layers of the mind. And a fictional character, in casu the little mermaid, may well manifest a young woman's longing for love- the role of the boy in the oedipal triangle- and his castration fear in relation to the phallic mother. And just as the fictional character is an inclusive symbol, so is the text, in its entirety, an extremely complex network which seen from varying perspectives forms different patterns of signification. The number of patterns, however, is not infinite, although we cannot fix the number, and neither is the number of valid interpretations. In rejecting a certain Jungian reading of the tale that makes the prince its protagonist, I do so because such a reading misunderstands both the narrative and the thematic structure of the text, znd-mirabile dictu-zlso the reader's primary point of identification in the text, which is certainly the mermaid, not the prince! The second objection to the psychoanalytical interpretation- the accusation of reducing the text to a symptom of the more or less neurotic psyche of its author- is more trivial. However, a literary text that is unrelated to the existential concerns of its author is seldom capable of moving us. The point is rather whether the author is capable of making his concern ours. Obviously, "Den lille Havfrue" is closely related to Andersen's concerns but is certainly not private. It is both possible and very tempting to point out its basis in the biography of its author. Yet, the deeply serious conscious and unconscious conflicts that give the tale its intensity and make it a formidable and moving work of literature are not Andersen's monopoly.</page><page sequence="19">The Merciless Tragedy of Desire 221 was painful, it was nothing compared to the fierceness of this second rite of passage. Thus, Andersen describes both the normal and an exceptional transition from childhood to puberty. In the first case, the transition is easy, because it is not yet accompanied by a definite desire contrary to the merpeople's nature and customs. Certainly, the mer- maid feels uncomfortable with the insignia of her status: "hun vilde saa gjerne have rystet hele denne Pragt af sig og lagt den tunge Krands; hendes rode Blomster i Haven klsedte hende meget bedre, men hun turde nu ikke gjore det om" (I: 92) ["[she] would gladly have ex- changed her heavy pearl wreath for one of the red flowers from her garden (she thought they suited her much better) but she didn't dare" (61)]. However, she does not yet have a definite project transcending the limits of her kind; but in the second case she certainly exceeds the limits set for her species. In exceeding these limits, she is punished by the same person who makes her transgression possible.7 Lacan's view that the subject is allowed entrance into the symbolic order by accepting the Name of the Father and the law may throw additional light on the mermaid's terrible stalemate.8 Accepting the Name of the Father means under the threat of castration giving up the object of desire- the mother- but also the integration of the subject into the symbolic order. Entering the symbolic order makes adult sexuality possible in a realm, that even if alien to the other provinces of the mind, will not block the subject's relations to others and to itself. The subject's entrance into the symbolic order, primarily the acquisi- tion of language, is decisive, not only because of the subject's ability to express itself, but also on account of the possibility of reacting to the way in which others define it. In other words, the acquisition of a personal identity is a correlative of the superindividual aspects of lan- guage. By virtue of the structure of language and the speech of others, the subject acquires an identity. If access to speech is blocked, then the subject is destined to being defined by others. The mermaid faces precisely this problem. She is entering the human world as a speechless and mut(e)ilated but still gendered being. Conse- quently, she cannot be known and recognized for what she is, namely 7 It is tempting, indeed, to interpret the desire for the transformation from one species to another as a displacement for the desire to change from one sex to other: from male to female. There is, however, also a social dimension to this desire, namely to become integrated in the bourgeois class (again a desire shared by the tale's author). 8 See particularly "Le stade du miroir comme formateur de la fonction du Je."</page><page sequence="20">222 Scandinavian Studies as- supposedly- a woman and as the prince's rescuer. From the very beginning, her relationship with the prince is determined by her mute- ness. When the prince applauds the song of the slave girls, she thinks: "O han skulde bare vide, at jeg, for at vaere hos ham, har givet min Stemme bort i al Evighed" (1 : 101) [ccOh, if he only knew that to be with him I have given away my voice for all eternity5' (71) ] . And even if, when the mermaid dances, it is said that "ved hver Bevsegelse blev hendes Deilighed endnu mere synlig, og hendes 0ine take dybere til Hjertet, end Slavindernes Sang"(I: 101) ["Her every movement revealed her loveliness and her eyes spoke far more eloquently than the slave's song" (71)], then the prince's enjoyment derives from aesthetic pleasure rather than from her erotic appeal. Indeed, he calls her his "lille Hittebarn" ["little foundling"], and "hun skulde alletider vsere hos ham" (I: 101) ["declared that she should never leave him"]which means only that "hun fik Lov at sove udenfor hans Dor paa en Floiels Pude" (I: 101) ["she was given permission to sleep in front of his door on a velvet pillow" (71)]. In this first phase of their relationship, the negation of her femininity culminates as the prince "lod hende sye en Mandsdragt, for at hun til Hest kunde folge ham" (1: 101) ["had men's clothes made for her, so that she could accompany him when he went horseback riding" (71)]. Thus, to be near the prince, she must accept the fact that the reason she wants to be in his presence- her feminine love for him- is negated. Certainly, the relationship between mermaid and prince changes into something else. The tale explains this development as follows: Dag for Dag blev hun Prindsen kj&amp;rere, han holdt af hende, som man kan holde afetgodt, kj art Barn, men atgpre hende til sin Dronning,faldt ham slet ikke ind, og hans Kone maatte hun blive, ellersfik hun ingen udedelig Sjd, men vildepaa hans Bryllups Morgen blive Skumpaa Seen. "Holder du ikke meest afmig, blandt dem allesammen!" syntes den lille Havfrues 0ine at sige, naar han tog hende i sine Arme og kyssede hendes smukke Pande. "Jo, du er mig kjarest," sagde Prindsen, "thi du har det bedste Hjerte af demAlle, du er mig meest hengiven? (I: 102) Day by day the prince grew fonder and fonder of her; but he loved her as he would have loved a good child, and had no thought of making her his queen. And she had to become his wife or she would never have an immortal soul, but on the morning after his marriage would become foam on the great ocean.</page><page sequence="21">The Merciless Tragedy of Desire 223 "Don't you love me more than you do all others?" was the message in the little mermaid's when the prince kissed her lovely forehead. "Yes, you are the dearest to me," said the prince, "for you have the kindest heart of them all. You are devoted to me." (71-2) The development of their relationship is certainly not in the direction of reciprocal love. On the contrary, the prince loves her as he would have loved a good child and because of her devotion- yet another negation of her feminine desire. The third phase in their relationship results from the prince's com- parison of the mermaid with his memory of the young girl from the temple at the sea. As a copy, the mermaid becomes emotionally present to the prince. Indeed, her likeness to the princess almost makes the picture of the latter disappear from his soul. Psychoanalytically, the object of love is not discovered, it is rediscov- ered. The individual is on a quest for an object that has as many features as possible in common with its conscious and unconscious concepts of the ideal object of love. These ideas are primarily modeled on the loves of childhood. Thus, the individual's longing for love is a striving to make memory, the ideal, and the present reality coincide, i.e. to actual- ize what is imagined. And, indeed, this is one of the main subjects of Andersen's tale. To the prince, the mermaid is a partial actualization of his remembrance of the princess, but she must retreat, when his remem- brance becomes flesh and blood. It is a stroke of genius that the fulfillment of the prince's love is an inextricable mixture of illusion and reality: illusion, because his thinks the princess is his rescuer, reality, since, in fact, she is the first woman he sees after having survived the shipwreck. And Andersen prolongs the pain. Even as a copy, the mermaid seems close to marrying the prince. When his parents force him to visit the foreign princess, he tells the mermaid: "JJeg mm see den smukkc Prindsesse, mine Forddre forlange det, men tvinge mig til at fore hende her hjem, som min Brud, ville de ikke! jeg kan ikke elske hende! hun ligner ikke den smukke Pige i templet, som du ligner, skulde jeg engang vdge en Brud, sd blev det snarere dig, mit stumme Hittebarn med de talende 0ine!v og han kyssede hendes rodeMund, legede med hendes lange Haar og lagde sitHoved ved hendes Hjerte, saa det dromte omMenneske- Lykke og en udodelig Sjd. (I: 103) "I must look at the beautiful princess, my parents demand it. But they won't force me to carry her home as my bride. I can't love her. She does</page><page sequence="22">224 Scandinavian Studies not look like the girl from the temple as you do. If I ever marry, I shall most likely choose you, my little foundling with the eloquent eyes." And he kissed her on her red lips and played with her long hair, and let his head rest so near her heart that it dreamed of human happiness and an immortal soul. (72) Doubtless, this situation is heart rending. At one and the same time, the prince's utterance brings him closer to and further from the mermaid: he chooses her as his bride, but only in passing, hypothetically, and because she resembles his memory image of another. And at the same time, he looks upon her as a child without social identity and fatally handicapped. However, by playing with her erotically the prince him- self denies her being a child. And the human happiness of which the mermaid is dreaming is most certainly the mutual fulfillment of erotic love. In the tale, the kiss functions as the emblem of love and eroticism. It is repeated in various forms six times, three times before and twice after this episode. 1. Solen steg saa r0d og skinnende op afVandet, det var ligesom om Prindsens Kinder fik Liv dewed, men 0inene bleve lukkede; Havfruen kyssede bans h0ie smukke Pande og strog hans vaade Haar tilbage; hun syntes, ban lignede Marmorst0tten nede i hendes lille Have, hun kyssede ham igjen, og 0nskede, at han dog maatte leve. (I: 93) 1. The sun rose, glowing red, and it rays gave color to the young prince's cheeks but his eyes remained closed. The little mermaid kissed his forehead and stroked his wet hair. She thought that he looked like the statue in her garden. She kissed him again and wished passionately that he would live.

(I: 105) 6. She [the little mermaid] pulled aside the crimson cloth of the tent and saw the beautiful bride sleeping peacefully, with her head resting on the prince's chest. The little mermaid bent down and kissed his handsome forehead. She turned and looked at the sky; more and more, it was turning red. She glanced at the sharp knife; and once more she</page><page sequence="24">226 Scandinavian Studies looked down at the prince. He moved a little in his sleep and whispered the name of his bride. Only she was in his thoughts, in his dreams! The little mermaid's hand trembled as it squeezed the handle of the knife. . . . (75) The first two times - her rescue of the prince and her memory of it- the prince is passive and unconscious while the mermaid active. The third time, in spite of her eloquent eyes, she is dependent on the prince's interpretation of her, and he is only fond of her, because she is devoted to him. The fourth time, the prince acts, but he only pretends, while the mermaid is passive. The fifth time, both prince and princess actively express their mutual love, as is true of the sixth and final time. Even in the sleep of consummated love, they are bound together only thinking of one another. Furthermore, the second and sixth passages highlight the difference between the prince's relationship to the mermaid ("[han] kunde ikke engang dromme om hende" (I: 95) ["he could not even dream about her" (65)] and to the princess (in his sleep he "nsevnede sin Brud ved Navn, hun kun var i hans Tanker" (I: 105) ["whispered the name of his bride. Only she was in his thoughts" (75)]. Finally, it should be noted that in the first, second, and third episodes the prince's head is resting on the chest of the mermaid, whereas, in the sixth, the head of the princess is resting on his chest. Before the prince rediscovers the princess, he can have and marry the mermaid, but he cannot dream of her (only of the princess), while the mermaid can dream of, but cannot have him. Thus, the tale posits a barrier between dream and realization and a barrier which the conclu- sion proves to be unsurmountable. However, it is certainly not the case that dream and realization are forever dissociated. But, the dream's realization is the privilege of the others, and precisely the realization of their happiness means the literal death of the subject. It should be noted that for both the prince and the mermaid (if not for the reader) the return of the princess is in fact miraculous. The prince says: ccDet er digl"sagde Prinsen, "dig, som harfrelst niig, dajeg laae som etLiig ved Kysten!" og ban trykkede sin redmende Brud i sine Anne. "Ojeg er altfor lykkelig!" sagde ban til den lille Havfrue. "DetBedste, detjeg aldrig turde haabe, er blevet opfyldtfor mig. Du vilgUde dig ved min Lykke, thi du holder meest afmig blandt demAllel" Og den lille Havfrue kyssede hans Haand, og hun syntes alt atfele sit Hjerte briste. (I: 104)</page><page sequence="25">The Merciless Tragedy of Desire 227 "It is you!" exclaimed the prince. "You are the one who saved me, when I lay half dead on the beach!" And he embraced his blushing bride. "Oh, now I am too happy," he said to the little mermaid. "That which I never dared hope has now happened! You will share my joy, for I know that you love me more than any of the others do." The little mermaid kissed his hand; she felt as if her heart was breaking. (73) In Aristotelian terminology, this represents a merging of recognition (anagnoresis) and reversal (peripetaia). This recognition, however, is a mixture of truth and illusion, and the reversal is double: for the prince from (relative) unhappiness to happiness, but for the mermaid from (relative) modest happiness to devastating unhappiness. Combining the partly illusory recognition with this double reversal makes possible a radicalization of love's tragedy, to wit the relationship between the desire of the subject and that of the other. The prince's remark to the mermaid shows that he is well aware of her desire for him, that he takes pleasure in it, and that he egoistically supposes- or pretends to sup- pose-that his happiness will be enjoyable to her. Thus, the prince desires the mermaid's desire without desiring her, whereas she desires both him and his desire. Their relationship is asymmetrical, while that between prince and princess is symmetrical. A generalization from the tale's reversal suggests that this concep- tion of love is unmitigated tragedy. Not only is the the reciprocal realization of love (the merging of dream and reality for both lovers) only allotted to others, but the happiness of the others implies, as if by necessity, the destruction of the subject. But the misery does not stop here. Before final ruin, the subject is forced to express its own desire as mute devotion, its love becomes acceptable only as passive, unarticulated suffering. But Andersen's tale does not stop by simply staging the tragedy of unrequited love but rather radicalizes tragedy, renders it even more heart breaking, and attempts to explain why such a tragedy seems unavoidable. The radical nature of love's tragedy has already been described. It is due to the sacrifices the mermaid makes because of her love, sacrifices she cannot even articulate. Even if she could tell the prince about the rescue and her painful sacrifices for his sake, it would hardly have helped her. The recipient of sacrifices feels, normally, gratefulness, but not necessarily love. Erotic desire is not awarded as an order of merit.</page><page sequence="26">228 Scandinavian Studies Unconsciously, the subject cannot understand why it is not loved when it has merited love. Andersen, though, offers three explanations that are connected and supplement each other. The first answer has already been given. In order to become another's object of desire, one must correspond to- be similar to- the other's conscious and particularly unconscious constructs of the object of desire. Only as the materialization of an imaginary object can the subject become the other's object of desire. The tale's second answer is an amplification of the first. Its point of departure is the two realms to which the protagonists and their doubles originally belong. Several scholars ( e.g. Nyborg, uDen indre linie" 86- 7; Duve 142-3; and Egholm Andersen 9-10) have commented on the important fact that the mermaid and the prince both have doubles within each others' original spheres, within the ocean the prince's double is the marble statue of the boy, on land the mermaid is doubled by the princess: princess prince ~ - ■ - ■ mermaid marble statue (Horizontally: the prince is related to the princess in the same way as the mermaid is related to the marble statue, and vertically, the princess is related to the the mermaid as the the prince to the statue.) This symmetry is unmistakable. The characters and the signifying elements- the marble statue- are evenly distributed between two realms. The sea is correlated with death/body/nature and earth with life/soul/culture. These distinctions invite a psychological interpreta- tion in which the sea becomes a symbol of the unconscious, instinctual, and destructive and the earth of consciousness, the ego, and regenera- tion. The demonic nature of the sea is, thus, contrasted with the sacred nature of the earth.9 This structural and psychological analysis is in- 9 In his interpretation of the tale, Nyborg sees the doubling of the characters as an instantiation of the Jungian model of the psyche: the mermaid and the princess represent the nature and the cultural aspects of the prince's anima, while the marble statue represents the prince's as well as Andersen's shadow (see Nyborg "Den indre linie" 86-7). This interpretation must be rejected on the grounds that it presupposes that the prince is the protagonist of the tale and the point of identification of its author. It is sensible to presume that an author identifies himself with all the characters of his text, to a great extent with some, to a lesser with others. There is, however, a tremendous difference between this point of view and Nyborg's unwarranted reading. Rejecting Nyborg's</page><page sequence="27">The Merciless Tragedy of Desire 229 triguing because of its simplicity and symmetry, but it also effaces the ongoing rearticulation of oppositions in the unfolding of the plot. However, even the ascription of general attributes to the two realms must be done with care, because man, belonging to earth, quite tradi- tionally is defined as both soul and body, implying that the instinctual and sexual are a genuine part of human existence. In this context color symbolism is telling: the prince's eyes gazing at the naked mermaid are the same color as the coal black blood of the sea witch, while the mermaid, who wants a human soul and immortality, has eyes of the same color as the princess, dark blue. Consequently, on the intentional level at least, human sexuality is not necessarily negative and destruc- tive. Rather sexuality is a force which unrestrained will lead to destruction and perdition, but which restrained and integrated leads to human happiness. On the contrary, in the sea the absence of soul rather than the presence of body characterizes the merpeople negatively. However, from this absence follows their affinity to death and perdition. But why are the elements doubled? First, it should be noted that the dialectical relationship of the original to the double is complicated. From the perspective of plot, the princess is the innocent and unwitting usurper of the position rightfully earned by the mermaid. From the perspective of the cosmic order of the tale, the mermaid is the intruder trying to create a relationship with the prince by feigning that she already is what she can only become by the action of the prince. Thus, the mermaid does in fact deceive the prince, although this deception seems innocent enough: she loves him, her action is dictated by the wish to obtain an immortal soul, and she cannot tell and is never asked who she is. Thus, one reason for this doubling may be that the princess is exactly what the mermaid aspires to be. By casting the mermaid's likeness in the form of a human, Andersen creates an insurmountable obstacle to the mermaid's desire. However, the asymmetrical desire is first established when the mer- maid ascends to the surface of the sea and exchanges the marble statue interpretation is not only necessary because he has nothing to say about the themes of salvation and grace (except to deplore the Christian dimension of the story), but also because his interpretation is unable to account for the complex dialectic of love and desire. And overlooking what every child who weeps over the fairy tale affirms- namely that the mermaid is the figure of the reader's (and the author's) identification- is inexplicable. Looking at the prince as the protagonist of the tale robs it of its tragic dimension.</page><page sequence="28">230 Scandinavian Studies for the living prince. Her imaginary object of desire is materialized in a human being- the prince- who is also a copy of a fantasy. To the mermaid, however, the realization is much more valuable than the image; indeed, the former is related to the latter as life to death. The mermaid is as replication and materialization of less worth than the memory image of the princess. Moreover, the mermaid's childhood fantasy of the prince antedates her meeting him, while the prince's mental image arose during his passage from childhood to youth, repre- sented by the ship wreck on the sea of sexuality and death. The symmetry is also emphasized by the two scenes of awakening to erotic love. The prince awakes looking into the eyes of an unknown young woman, while, at her awakening, the mermaid meets the look of her beloved. In spite of the continuity of the mermaid's desire and longing, a distance between her and the object of desire exists from the beginning. Her longing is attached to something which is not alive and alien to her nature- the statue- and her garden becomes a place of sorrow and yearning. With the transformation of the object of desire from non-living to living status and her own transformation into quasi human beings, the obstacles should have been removed. Her unfulfilled desire results from the fact that the prince loves the image of the one he first saw when he awoke. If he had not been unconscious during the mermaid's rescue or if she had remained with him until he awoke, he would, have seen the the mermaid first. Leaving the prince suggests she is shy and modest but more significantly denotes that she belongs to another species and another element. Because of this difference in kind, the mermaid cannot appear to the prince as she is, i.e. with her own identity. Thus, the reason she cannot assume the position of the prince's internalized object of desire is that she has not yet discarded her own identity: her nature is an obstacle to her desire.10 Interpreting this state of affairs as a general statement about the necessary conditions for being desired, Andersen's second explanation of desire's predicament is that as one is, one cannot be loved. Only by denying oneself, one's origin, and one's nature and becoming the image of the other can one, perhaps, be loved. This brings us back, once more, to the metamorphosis of the mer- maid effected by the sea witch. If this change is a castration that at one 10 Cf. note 6.</page><page sequence="29">The Merciless Tragedy of Desire 231 and the same time lays bare her sex and deprives her of it, then she is the victim of a diabolic contradiction. This contradiction is symbolized by her muteness and the pain in the feet she suffers from their just touching the ground. Her muteness causes a loss of individual and social identity in the eyes of others: she is changed from princess into a foundling without social identity, she is changed into a child, and she lives on charity in the prince's court. These external consequences of her muteness are, however, a result of its inward nature. She cannot speak because she cannot reveal who and what she is. The possibility of a happy ending, if only she could tell him that she was his rescuer, is illusory, because in doing so she would have to reveal her true nature and assert her identity. Furthermore, her castration by the sea witch paralyzes her resolve to obtain the object of desire and makes the opposition between a socially enforced identity and a natural one insurmountable. As the loss of the beloved is rendered complete by the consumma- tion of the marriage of the prince and princess, the mermaid is once again offered the help of the sea witch in transcending her passive state. The knife that she must plunge into the heart of the prince in order to save herself symbolically is the phallus that the sea witch took from her, now a deadly weapon, a tool of aggression and destruction. Once more the mermaid is brought into an unresolvable contradiction. Asserting her own sexuality means both a negation of her passive but positive yearning for love and the destruction of the object of desire. That which in religious interpretations is self-denial making her worthy of God's grace is in a psychoanalytic context the destruction of the protagonist as a victim of incompatible, indeed antagonistic instinctual impulses.11 The unredeemable and tragic contradiction in the mermaid's yearn- ing for love may be formulated as the tale's third explanation of the impossibility of reciprocated love: if one wants to be loved, one is not allowed to desire. The loss of love- the beloved's withdrawal of love from the subject- is a punishment for exceeding limits and prohibi- tions as well as the prototype of the threat of castration. Therefore, if one actively attempts to satisfy or even to express desire, one will be deprived of that desire by that which one desires, i.e. of one's sex. This is precisely what happens to the little mermaid. Her desire for the prince is so strong that she is willing to sacrifice everything to realize it. 11 Cf. note 6.</page><page sequence="30">232 Scandinavian Studies So, she accepts castration/muteness as the condition of her desire and, unknowingly, the impediment to its realization. Taking the tale's three explanations together yields the following generalization about the conditions of love or rather about the impos- sibility of its realization: to be loved one must not desire, but if one, in spite of all, desires, one will be deprived of the possibility of realizing or even expressing it. Only by self-denial and the creation of a self in the image of the other, can one, perhaps, be loved. But being loved depends on being congruent with the other's desire, with the other's imaginary object of desire. Here, though, one is powerless, since one cannot shape the other's dream. One's fate is, thus, dependent on others. The conditions of love and its fulfillment are represented multi- dimensionally in the tale. On the narrative level, the question of the conditions of love during the passage from childhood to adolescence is paramount. In the text, these conditions are inextricably related to childhood problems where the relation with the phallic and castrating mother is central. Thus, the importance of the imago of the terrible mother places one of the tale's decisive conflicts in early childhood, in the pre-oedipal phase. Since the phallic mother in fact castrates the child, the oedipal fantasy of castration is also prominent. Therefore one must ask whether the prince, in addition to functioning as the young mermaid/woman's object of desire, also plays the role of an oedipal father figure. In fact, certain features suggest such an interpretation. His eyes are of the same black color as those of the sea witch, connoting mature, and consequently dangerous, indeed, deadly sexuality. Fur- thermore, the relationship between prince and mermaid is in many ways described as a father-daughter relationship: she is in fact called a Hittebarn. He is, in certain ways addressing and treating her like a child, and she is one of the bridesmaids at the wedding. The Interaction of the Themes: The Conclusion of the TXle I The interdependence of the two central themes of the tale is obvious since in the beginning, salvation depends on love's fulfillment. Further- more, the theme of erotic love is at odds with that of salvation, a fact probably unknown to Andersen himself. The crucial consideration,</page><page sequence="31">The Merciless Tragedy of Desire 233 though, is that of the interaction of the two themes, not in the begin- ning but at the end of the tale. The centrality of the religious dimension of the tale is certainly not in question because the preceding analysis has confirmed Baggesen's in- terpretation ("Individuation" 50-1) showing that in this respect the text is coherent. The question is rather one of the precise relation of the religious to the erotic. It would be a mistake to see one or the other as dominant. Even though the theme of erotic love comprises most of the story, the theme of salvation is constantly present. Earthly love, characterized by sexuality and eroticism, is with regard to the protagonist represented as a course marked by yearning, renun- ciation, and deprivation which may lead to perdition. In the moment when the mermaid is stricken with jealousy and is near plunging the knife into the prince's heart, erotic love is shown in all its potential negativity and destructiveness. And even though the temptation is resisted, unrequited love leads to suffering and death. If both conscious and unconscious ramifications are taken into ac- count, the course of earthly love may be described as follows: 1. Being's/having's lack is experienced as a vague, unspecific longing, a desire not (yet) directed towards an object; 2. Desire is directed toward an object- the prince- and through him the yearning for an immortal soul; 3. One's own nature is denied for the sake of the object of love (the rescue of the prince); 4. The mermaid is split between actual identity and an ideal ego; 5. At one and the same time, self-mutilation/castration is a revelation and a deprivation of sex; 6. Devotion to and denial of one's own demand for love are deadlocked in the passivity; 7. The fulfillment of the other's love threatens the existence of the subject; 8. The possibility of acquiring the active position depends on destroying the object of desire</page><page sequence="32">234 Scandinavian Studies 9. Rejection of phallic, destructive self-assertion is conceived; 10. Suicide is self-sacrifice. This course from alienation and lack to death contrasts sharply with the blissful love of the prince and princess, and the tale, thus, cannot be read as a simple denunciation of eros. Nevertheless, it is indeed a touching elegy on the devastating effects of unrequited love. But tragically the fulfillment of erotic love is affected by forces for the most part uncon- trolled by the subject itself. Consequently, no necessary connection links the subject's actions and character with the fulfillment of its desire. This conception of the nature of erotic love means that an interpreta- tion of existence based on nothing but eroticism would be not only tragic, but contingent, meaningless, and unjust. Such a conception of existence is beyond what Andersen and Danish romanticism could accept as a general vision du monde. But Andersen and other authors, such as Blicher for instance, could very well conceive of it. Indeed in "Den lille Havfrue," Andersen represents such a vision with a unique rigor up to the point of the protagonist's death. Death, however, is the turning point in the tale where a human and limited paradigm of existence is superseded by a divine and circumscribed human love bound to the erotic is superseded by the unfailing love of God revealed as grace. This reorientation requires a reinterpretation of the whole course of events by the text itself- literary texts most often possess a certain degree of self- exegesis- which makes it coherent and teleological and makes human existence meaningful and just. The pain remains, however, and the text's two interpretive para- digms continue to exist side by side, because the text's self-interpretation does not nullify its earthly tragedy, but rather it confirms it. Although the grandmother quotes the marriage ritual, the idea that the individual is saved through the love of a spouse is neither central to Christianity at large nor to Protestantism. The conclusion's denial of being loved as a condition for obtaining an immortal soul means a return to a more traditional Christian concept of grace. The daughters of the air explain the salvation of the mermaid in this way: "Havfruen bar ingen udodelig Sjd, kan aldrigfaae den, uden hun vinder et Menneskes Kjarlighed! af en fremmed Magt afh&amp;nger hendes evige Tilv&amp;relse. Luftens Dottre have heller ingen evig Sjd, men de kunne selv ved</page><page sequence="33">The Merciless Tragedy of Desire 235 gode Handling er skabe sig een. . . . Du stakkels lille Havfrue bar med bele dit Hjerte stmbt efter det samme som vi, du bar lidt og taalt, h&lt;zvet dig til Luftaandernes Verden, nu kan du selvgjennemgode Gierninger skabe dig en udodelig Sjd om tre hundred Aar? (I: 106) "Mermaids have no immortal soul and can never have one, unless they can obtain the love of a human being. Their chance of obtaining eternal life depends upon others. We, daughters of the air, have not received an eternal soul either; but we can win one by good deeds. . . . You, little mermaid, have tried with all your heart to do the same. You have suffered and borne your suffering bravely; and that is why you are now among us, the spirits of the air. Do your good deeds and in three hundred years an immortal soul will be yours." (75-6) Here being loved by a member of the opposite sex is suspended as the condition of salvation, and her struggle, suffering, and good deeds become the justification for God's grace. It could be argued that this is an expression of sentimentality and orthodoxy, but looking at the conclusion in this way means minimizing desire's merciless tragedy. It seems to me a secular prejudice to consider the tale's conclusion incongruent and incredible. Given the fact that the tale's interpretive frame is religious, the mermaid has already made herself worthy of God's grace by passing the three tests. Curiously, Andersen scholarship has not questioned the first condition of grace, although there seems to be ample reason for doing so: to posit the legitimate and consummated erotic happiness as a conditio sine qua non for obtaining an immortal soul may very well from a religious and ethical perspective be considered offensive, because in this way the questions of grace and salvation are subordinated to the sphere of eros. Thus, a continuity is established between the human and the divine on the basis of human ideas about happiness. We have to insist that the tale is explicit on this point: redemption is neither due to Christ's love for man nor to Mary's intercession, but through the consummated sexual and erotic bliss sanctioned by religion through the sacrament of mar- riage. The reason the reader is not disposed to question or be offended by the tale's first condition of salvation is probably that the reader is deeply affected by Andersen's unorthodox doctrine. However, the course of events and the conclusion negate this way of bringing the human close to the divine. And this negation expresses a painful not a senti- mental insight.</page><page sequence="34">236 Scandinavian Studies Fairy Tales Told for Children: The Conclusion of the TXle II Nevertheless, one might still be justified in claiming that the conclusion would have been purer if the mermaid had been saved by virtue of her sacrifices and good works. However, several structural features render this part of the conclusion logical, if not necessarily acceptable. In addition to the fact that the daughters of the air fill in a place in the combinatory diagram of the first theme, requiring the mermaid's pro- cess of acquiring a soul to pass through a phase where both body and soul are absent is important. Especially because a phase in which body and soul could become united (through marrying a human being) ended in failure. The two routes may be represented thusly: a) body + soul soul + body body + soul ^ b) body + soul ^ Possibility a), representing the human road to salvation, is not open to the mermaid, and consequently only b), the road of negation remains. Questions, though not raised at all remain: why does the mermaid not have a soul and is she in need of salvation? Part of the answer is, of course, given by the lore and tradition known and partly used by Andersen (see Brix 77-80 and Kofoed 98-102 and 189-93). In this tale, the concept of "soul," in addition to its religious core signification, also connotes human happiness, i.e. a soul seems to be a precondition for a fulfilling and happy life in this world. This interpretation is confirmed by the traditional condition for obtaining a soul, marriage to a man. To possess a soul, then, means not only partaking in man's ultimate bliss - immortality- but also being integrated into a rich human life. The difference in kind between human beings and merpeople seems, thus, to imply the possibility and capability for happiness. In Socrates's speech in "Symposium" (201D-212C), eros is both the striving for the happi- ness which comes from creating and contemplating the beautiful and the good and that which is linked with immortality. Andersen might very well have been inspired by Plato and his scala amoris. Yet, in "Den lille Havfrue" the Christian doctrine of self-denial becomes a precondi- tion of grace, is understood as compensation. If life is not rich and</page><page sequence="35">The Merciless Tragedy of Desire 237 fulfilling but rather full of deprivation and suffering, then the immortal- ity of the soul renders justice in the next world possible. This idea is one of Andersen's consistent themes and is impressively exemplified in his commentary on the fairy tales (specifically to "En Historie fra Klitterne " 3:169-98). Here he relates the following conversation with Oehlenschlager: Vi take om det evige Liv, og Oehlenschlager henkastede de Ord: aer De saa vis pact, at der er et Liv efter dette!"Jeg holdtfastpaa Forvisningen herom, grundet i GudsBxtfardighed, men brugte i min starke Udtalelse de uoverveiede Ord: "Mennesket kanforlange det!v- Da vedblev han: "Er det ikke igjen en stor Forfongelighed of Dem, at turde forlange et evigt Liv. Har ikke Gud givet Dem saa uendeligt Meget i denne Verden. Jeg veed," vedblev han, "hvilken uendelig Fylde of Godhed han forundte mig; naar jeg i Doden lukker mine 0ine viljeg taknemlig prise og velsigne ham; forundes mig da endnu et evigt Liv, da tagerjeg det som en ny uendelig Naade." aSaaledes kan De tale," sagde jeg, aGudgav Dem saa uendeligt Meget paa Jorden, ogsaajeg borsige det, men hvor Mange stilledes ikkeganske anderledes i Verden, de kastedes herind med et sygt Legeme, en kuetAand, fortes ind i de bitreste Forhold til Sorg og Savn, hvorfor skulle de saaledes lide, hvorfor blev det saa ulige fordeelt, det var en Uret, og den kan Gud ikke ove, han vilgive Erstatning, lefte og kfse Det vi ikke kunne!" (6: 17) We were talking about the eternal life, and Oehlenschlager made the remark: "Are you so certain that there is a life after this one?" I maintained this conviction on the grounds of God's righteousness, I used, however, in my strong statement the rash words: "Man can demand this!" "Is it not a great presumption on your part to dare demand eternal life? Has not God given you so infinitely much in this world? I know," he continued, "what infinite abundance of goodness he has granted me; when I close my eyes in death, I will gratefully praise and bless him; if then I am also granted eternal life, I will take it as a new infinite grace!" "So you may say" said I, "God gave you so infinitely much on earth, and I ought to say so myself, but so very many are less fortunate in this world. They were thrown into it with an ailing body, with a daunted spirit, were put in the most bitter conditions of sorrow and depriva- tion. Why did they have to suffer this, why was everything so unequally allotted? That was unjust, and God cannot do wrong. He will provide compensation and resolve that which we cannot!" (my trans.)</page><page sequence="36">238 Scandinavian Studies Obviously, this concept of eternal life may give rise to objections from many modern readers, but the rejection of Andersen's faith does not justify doubting that it was a structuring power of the tale. However, one problem remains. Andersen is not satisfied with leav- ing the mermaid among the daughters of the air for three hundred years during which time she can work out her salvation by doing good works. He lets, rather, the behavior of children either abridge or extend this period. This conclusion is defended by Baggesen with the following argument: Det er ikke rigtigt, ndr luftens dotre havder, at deresfrelse i mods&amp;tning til havfruens ikke afh&lt;znger afenfremmed magt. De er lige sd afhangige of bornenes artighed, som havfruen var afprinsens hzrlighed. ... Pd eventyrets meningsplan er prinsens hzrlighed og bernenes artighed parallelle; de er begge handlinger hos et menneske, hvoraf ikke dets egen, men et andet menneskes frelse ajhanger. ("Individuation" 73) It is not true, as the daughters of the air claim that their salvation, in contradistinction to the mermaid's, is not dependent on a foreign power. They are just as dependent on the children's good behavior as the mermaid was on the love of the prince. . . . On the level of the tale's signification, the love of the prince and the good behavior of the children are parallel; they are both actions of a being on which its own salvation does not depend but rather that of another person. ("Indi- viduation" 73, my trans.) Baggesen goes on to say that "Den lille Havfrue" presents a radical version of the greatest commandment in the New Testament "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself" (Matt. 19:19, Mark 12:31; cf. Luke 10:27) The tale, according to Baggesen, interprets the commandment to say that your neighbor is delivered into your hands, so you shall love him, because his salvation depends on your love ("Individuation" 73). This argument is ingenious and appealing, since it ensures the semantic coherence of the text. I strongly disagree however. In my view, the tale states that human love is insufficient and turns into boundless heavenly love. A decisive weakness of Baggesen's argument is the parallel be- tween the responsibility of the children and that of the prince- both of which are then generalized into a demand for love of one's neighbor- which fails to account for the fact that the prince's love for the mermaid is decidedly erotic. Consequently the parallelism between the prince and the children is untenable, and the tale's conclusion has to be ex- plained differently.</page><page sequence="37">The Merciless Tragedy of Desire 239 In my view, the communicative situation- the fact that the tale has two addressees- offers an explanation of the story's conclusion. It is well known that Andersen always was very conscious of this double addressee. With regard to "Den lille Havfrue" in the preface, "Til de addre Laesere," Andersen writes: Under Udarbeidelsen of et storre, ganske fra disse forskjelligt Arbeide, paatmngte sig mig imidlertidldeen og Udviklingen afet nytEventyr: "Den lille Havfrue"- Jeg maatte nedskrive det. Dersom jeg lod det udkomme som en lille Bog for sig, da gjorde man maaskee storre Fordring, jegfandt det derfor bedst, at lade det slutte sig til den engang begyndte Cyclus afEventyr; ethvert afhine egner sig maaskee mere for Barnet, end dette, hvis dybere Betydning kun den JEldre forstaaer, men jeg t0r dog troe, at Barnet vil have Ghde deraf og Opkfsningen selv, ligefrem betragtet, vilgribedet. (I: 19) While working on a bigger project quite different from these [fairy tales], the idea and the development of a new fairy tale, "The Little Mermaid," forced itself upon me- I had to write it. I preferred to let it come out as a little book on its own, but such a great demand arose that I found it best to let it attach itself to the cycle of fairy tales I had already begun writing. Any of these is perhaps better suited to children than this one, whose deeper meaning the adults can understand. I dare presume, however, that the child will also enjoy it and that the denouement itself, plainly considered, will grip the child, (my trans.) Andersen's concerns about the tale's appropriateness for reading to children is quite unmistakable. It is not quite clear, though, what the word Opbsning denotes. Obviously, it refers to the end of the tale, but the end is tripartite: 1) the seeming destruction of the mermaid; 2) her association with the daughters of the air; and 3) the role of the children during this period of transition. To which of these three Andersen is referrring cannot be decided with absolute certainty. Nevertheless, Andersen's concern allows us to infer that he intentionally addressed the last pargraph to the child who heard or read the tale in order to attach it to a life world and to draw a moral from it. And allow me to claim that the moral of this paragraph is not formidable at all but linked with an important dimension of the tale in another way. The conclusion justifies childhood's network of prohibitions and requirements: "If you do/don't this or that, then. ..." where the continuation has many varia-</page><page sequence="38">240 Scandinavian Studies tions. They can, however, be divided into two groups a) cc. . . then you will certainly be sorry/be punished," or b) "... then you will make me sorry,'5 i.e. a guilty consciousness is grafted onto the child by the threat of losing the love of the parent. In conclusion, Andersen adds, for hverDag vifinde etgodtBarn, somgjersine Forddre GUde ogfortjener deres Kjarlighed^forkorter Gud vorPwvetid. Barnet veed ikke, naar viflyve gjennem Stuen, og maae vi da of GUde smile over det, da tages etAarfra de trehundrede, men see vi et uartigt og ondtBarn, da maae vi grade Sorgens Graad, og hver Taare Ugger en Dag til vor Prevetid!" (I: 106) if we [the daughters of the air] find a good child, who makes his parents happy and deserves their love, we smile and God takes a year away from the time of our trial. But if there is a naughty and mean child in the house we come to, we cry; and for every tear we shed, God adds a day to the three hundred years we already must serve. (76) I find it hard, to say the least, to see this as a difficult moral but rather understand it as the crystallization of the theme of self-denial and self- sacrifice common to the religious and the instinctual dimension of the tale. The precept "Thou shalt not desire" not only motivates the threat of loss of love and castration, but is also basic to Christian doctrine transmitted through child rearing. Thus, the tale expresses a strange ambiguity: in its explicit moral, it perpetuates those norms and mechanisms of subordination whose terrifying consequences it has just illustrated. However, before we feel indignant, we should realize that the passage from nature to culture, which the tale narrates, is a passage that every individual must make or perish. The cruelty of Andersen's story, but also its sublime tragedy, is due to the fact that it tells the story of someone who had an intense longing to make this passage, who willingly made sacrifices to do so, and who perished.
