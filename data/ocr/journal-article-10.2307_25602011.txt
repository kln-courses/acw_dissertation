(Journals i: 251, 253) Onno Oerlemans's wide-ranging and illuminating literary-environmental study, Romanticism and the Materiality of Nature, enlists this journal entry as an important instance of the "dilemma of the romantic impulse to 'know' the natural world." It is a dilemma, according to Oerlemans, because the impulse ends in a feeling not of connectedness but of alienation, for the na ture contemplated proves incapable of being resolved into distinct or amal gamated objects subsumable under the categories of reason (195). Like other romantic-era writers, including her two fellow travelers, Dorothy Wordsworth discovers material nature's sublimely unknowable character: "inert and inimical to consciousness, rather than open to and productive of it" (202). Physical proximity to nature reveals the observer's epistemological distance from nature. At this textual site, as in numerous other passages, Oerlemans provoca tively envisions a romantic environmentalism that is more gray than green (in Paul Fry's parlance). Where James McKusick's more recent Green Writ ing eschews the dichotomous view of nature as inert and of representation as isolated, Oerlemans celebrates this "shock of the material" (209), not least for its challenging of holistic conceptions of mind and nature, such as those espoused by Jonathan Bate and Karl Kroeber. Romanticism and the Materiality of Nature draws well upon the work of other environmental crit ics, notably Alan Bewell, Carolyn Merchant, and Patrick Murphy. But the book may owe its greatest debts both to Geoffrey Hartman's Wordsworth's Poetry, which similarly unearths an antipathetic rather than sympathetic na ture, and to Thomas Weiskel's Burkean-Freudian rendering of the sublime. Oerlemans's reading of linguistic and conceptual aporia?what amounts to a kind of negative sublime?owes much, for its part, to post-structuralist theories of representation, as the book's sense of history is indebted, broadly speaking, to new-historicist criticism. Nature writing becomes a form of mourning work: "a nostalgia for the material world we know we are somehow a part of but yet [find ourselves] estranged from" (22). And for Oerlemans this intimation of nature's otherness, as well as of its related resistance to conceptual and linguistic containment, "ought to inspire awe and respect" (29)?the necessary first step in greening or graying human kind's relationship to the natural world.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 453 Following in Hartman's footsteps, the book's first chapter shows William Wordsworth's environmental countervision to be that of the inherent "in difference, hostility, and inimicalness of material reality"?a reality "un knowable and untranslatable" (35, 37). The Lucy poems and The Prelude particularly reveal Wordsworth's troubled "awareness of how conscious ness springs from the material realm even though it is not reducible to, and remains fundamentally different from, that of nature" (52). The poet may view external nature as a source of the real, an anchor of materiality, but he cannot "trace the path of the anchor line" (51). For Oerlemans such trou bled awareness informs a Wordsworthian poetics and environmentalism marked by loss, alienation, and a longing for the real. Along similar lines, the book's second chapter finds various pictorial representations of animals to "reveal a genuine otherness in nature," an otherness raised by the issue of anthropocentrism itself. The very prohibition against anthropomor phism, Oerlemans provocatively asserts, may itself function as an instru ment of anthropocentrism by turning the nonhuman "into an otherness subservient to human needs" (69). George Stubbs's paintings, "by making [animals] look remotely human," challenge viewers' anthropocentric ex pectations, for the animals depicted "seem somewhat like us" (74)?even too much like us. Oerlemans similarly demonstrates how, in poems by Wordsworth, Coleridge, and John Clare, anthropomorphizing passages disclose human beings' tangled, uncanny relationships to the materiality of the animal world. Oerlemans previously published an essay on Percy Bysshe Shelley's veg etarianism, and Chapter Three revises that reading in light of Timothy Morton's Shelley and the Revolution in Taste. These pages usefully focus upon the ways in which Shelley's views about diet, the body, and social change prove to be deeply "connected to a recuperation of the physicality of human existence in nature," thus grounding the poet's Utopian politics "in what appeared to him to be discernible physical laws" (100). Rather than just smile at Shelley's rather grandiose claim in A Vindication of Natural Diet, that a vegetarian regimen "strikes at the root of all evil," Oerlemans partly defends it. He points out that, strictly speaking, the tract states not "that diet is the root cause of evil, but that a change to a vegetable diet goes to the core of our spiritual and physical being." For Shelley, a "natural diet" thereby can enable those who practice it to "consciously change the material 'roots' of [their] being," and by doing so also help usher those same people toward envisioning significant ecological reform (116). As in "Mont Blanc," in the dietary essays, Oerlemans argues, "doubt about our human mastery of nature reveals to us our dependence upon it [nature] and the need for a new temperance" (119). Unable to be "overcome" inside and outside the human form, the natural world's materiality can be, and</page><page sequence="4">454 BOOK REVIEWS must be, utilized to "recreate ourselves" (101), which will, Shelley implies, in turn alter our treatment of nature. Drawing upon the historical analysis of Lovejoy and of Foucault, in Chapter Four Oerlemans reads turn-of-the-century taxonomy mainly as a "language effect." As in Locke, "[e]ach level of generality is achieved only by a corresponding loss of detail of the real, of the individual specimens" (130). Oerlemans connects these "metaphysics of classification" to writings by Coleridge, Shelley, and Clare. The chapter focuses briefly but intrigu ingly upon Coleridge's Theory of Life (ca. 1816?18) and Contributions to a Course of Lectures Given by L. H. Green (1828), the sole examples of a ro mantic author "explicitly and extensively concerning] himself with the de bate in natural history over the reality of species" (133). Oerlemans enlists Raimonda Modiano's claim that Coleridge's Platonic absolutism (his ideal ist reification of the concept of species) required him to turn away from his "early devotion to a close observation of the external appearances of na ture." Regrettably, the chapter leaves unexamined just what sort of taxo nomic or other scientific principles informed (and perhaps complicated) that early devotion to nature. The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, for one, cer tainly raises important doubts about what an albatross is. Turning to Shel ley's "Mont Blanc," Oerlemans insightfully reads the poem as challenging the age's new legislators of material nature?Linnaeus, Buffon, and Cuvier?by subtly exposing "the incommensurate nature of our ability to recognize and reproduce external order" (146). It would strengthen the ar gument to consider as well the poem's enigmatic conclusion, so as to eluci date how the perceiving mind's imaginative power relates to such sublime incommensurability. Oerlemans is most persuasive about Clare's "celebra tion of the thing in itself," a celebration that ultimately exposes uncanny "gaps in the implied blank spots left between moments of observation, or in explicit inabilities to name" (143). These blank spots in time, as it were, resist taxonomic categorization and intimate both the limits of classification and the vast otherness of nature's materiality. The last of the five chapters sets out to demonstrate that romantic-era travel writing's "documentation of the particularity of the physical world" can, despite the genre's imperialist and other "ideological repercussions," serve as "an end in itself, symbolic of nothing, filled with the intense com plexity of the real" (148, 166). Dorothy and William Wordsworth's travel writings repeatedly reveal nature's elusive, unsignifiable being, while at the same time depicting the observing mind as uncannily homeless?"without [a] lasting abiding-place," in Dorothy's memorable terms. Such writings point to the divide between material nature's otherness and the perceiving mind's uncanny alienation. William and Dorothy's travel-related works do so, Oerlemans claims, both because they foreground "the deep inability of language to penetrate or reproduce the materiality of the physical world"</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 455 (185) and because they remind us that meaning is "contingent, a construct rather than something essentially there" (197). The latter insight is an espe cially important one, particularly in terms of gauging the sublime (it could illuminate as well the previous chapter's analysis of "Mont Blanc"). The question remains to what extent such surmised elusiveness regarding na ture's meaning or being can be said really to stand apart from or even to strike at nineteenth-century ideologies of imperialism, nationalism, gender, and class?ideologies often rooted in the British landscape. Romanticism and the Materiality of Nature invites, and even obliges, readers to question the basis for holistic and other assessments of romantic-period depictions of the natural world. The book is revisionist and something of a manifesto. It valuably leaves one much to ponder, but may also leave some readers wishing for a bit more: for more poems to have been examined (from William Wordsworth's "spots of time" to Coleridge's "Eolian Harp" and Clare's "Nightingale's Nest"), for more close reading, for more refer ences to recent criticism, and for more history. Under Oerlemans's gaze, literary texts can at times seem almost without history, aside from their writer-observers' own personal experiences and metaphysical conceptions. Perhaps because Romanticism and the Materiality of Nature tends to treat his tory as a kind of screen of false consciousness, but often sidesteps new historicist material analysis, the book focuses less than it might upon the historical circumstances that shaped a given text's representation of nature, let alone upon the history of that depicted locale. In its readings of Words worth, Coleridge, and other poets, the book also arguably pays too little at tention to literary history, including the texts' particular histories of com position, publication, and reception. Oerlemans rightly argues that romantic works not only "celebrate the particular moment of perception" but that they also reflect "self-consciously on the limits of language, repre sentation, and knowledge" (200, 23). The reader might reasonably expect, then, to see more evidence of those depicted textual limits. Yet this book's varied sketchings and mappings of the romantic period's material terrain are more than simply intriguing; they usefully challenge one's thinking and linger long after the pages have been read. The study is a significant accom plishment and an important contribution to the growing field of ecological criticism. "What are men to rocks and mountains!" Elizabeth Bennet aptly ex claims, contemplating the prospect of a Lake District tour. Her exclamation belies an important question, one that Oerlemans's book investigates and, in part, answers through the conceptual lens of the sublime. Like Austen's heroine, romantic poets and painters never quite reach their destinations, and their writings serve well to call into question the relationship between human beings and the natural world. Contemplated in all its diversity and particularity, yet ever at a distance, nature's ungraspable essence beckons in</page><page sequence="6">456 BOOK REVIEWS the attentive observer not a feeling of cognitive power but a vertiginous sense of incapacity and awe. And for Oerlemans it is at this point that na ture writing heralds, and even becomes, a basis for environmental reform. The question remains whether such resulting awe, produced by experi ences of nature's indeterminate otherness, can provide practical ground for a more respectful, more ecological, relationship to the natural world. Oerlemans appears to think so. But one wonders. One wonders especially in light of the development of universal human rights, initiated, Lynn Hunt convincingly argues, by eighteenth-century and later readers of literature coming to sympathize and identify with newly depicted Others (e.g., with Richardson's Pamela). Might not similar sorts of imaginative connections have been, and still be, necessary for hu man beings to extend respect and rights to the objectified realm of nature? Human beings may feel awe for sublime gaps, limits, "genuine otherness," and all else that exceeds comprehension. But will such awe inspire respect, and even compassion and care? Oerlemans finds in William Wordsworth, particularly, "a complex sympathy that at once recognizes a deep-rooted commonality between humans and animals, and a respect for the individu ality and even incomprehensibility of non-human consciousness" (95). Like sympathetic identification, anthropomorphism risks reducing other ness to a reflection of oneself and one's all-too-human needs. And yet, as Oerlemans helps us to see, what might appear to be mere solipsism or nar cissism can instead reveal "deep-rooted commonality"?commonality that may redefine our notions of humankind and nature. We come to perceive not just ourselves in the Other but also the Other in ourselves, which is to say in a selfhood altered to include what was once other. Oerlemans's as sessment of Shelley's Utopian vegetarianism attests to the fact that human kind's relationship to material nature will inevitably revolve around human needs and principles. To find ourselves implicated in nature, and to see na ture within ourselves, might indeed, then, be the necessary ground for eco logical reform?and cause for hope.
