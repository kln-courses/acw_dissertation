This mono- graph attempts "to explain the factors that determine sea- bird occurrence and distribution in the Ross Sea during summer." Data from seabird censuses on six cruises are correlated with oceanographic measurements and dietary information from collected specimens. Text and charts describe the environment and give the findings for 21 species (Emperor Penguin to Arctic Tern). These results are analyzed and discussed with regard to the birds' feeding behavior, trophic relations, community composition and biomass, and the factors affecting seabird occurrence. The study reaches important conclusions about prey selection and the importance of food abundance as a limiting factor for high latitude Antarctic bird populations in summer, ideas that may well apply elsewhere. Robert Cushman Murphy would be proud to see how far his light has carried. References, appendixes. Nature Through Tropical Windows.--Alexander F. Skutch, illustrated by Dana Gardner. 1983. University of Califor- nia Press, Berkeley. 374 p. $19.95. "It took Kropotkin to take the edge off Darwin," Alexander Skutch has said, voicing profound dissatisfaction with a vision of nature red in tooth and claw. In his latest book Skutch invests his always painstaking, always valuable accounts of nat- ural history with a sense of his perplexity over the relative importance of competition and cooperation in evolution. The dissonance between graceful descriptions of what he sees as cooperation and reflections on current views of the selfish nature of social behavior make the book worth thinking about. Lyric writing and elegant illustrations re- flect forty years of unhurried days spent watching the dis- appearing tropical world. Although the writing evokes shades of eighteenth and nineteenth century naturalists, it would be a mistake to dismiss Skutch as an isolated ec- centric, a relic of Natural Theology. In this book, which addresses-more explicitly than earlier works-his con- cerns about allowing the predictions of population genetics to dominate our explanations of social behavior, Skutch is frequently successful at revealing how highly contrived some of our currently fashionable selfish-gene ideas may be.--M. F. Lawton. A Field Guide to the Grand Canyon.- Stephen Whitney. 1982. Quill, New York. 320 p. Paper cover. $12.50. This easily-carried volume offers a little of everything about the natural history of the Grand Canyon. At least for birds and their habitats, its treatment is not very successful. The five pages of text on birds are less than illuminating, while the 15 plates of bird illustrations are uneven, with mostly stiff and generalized poses. By contrast, the plates of but- terflies and herptiles are convincing and accurate. Provides 87 plates, 17 figures, index.-J. Tate. Myology of the Purple-throated Carib (Eulampisjugula- ris) and Other Hummingbirds (Ayes: Trochilidae).- Richard L. Zusi and Gregory Dean Bentz. 1984. Smithson- ian Contributions to Zoology No. 385, Smithsonian In- stitution Press, Washington, DC. 70 p. Paper cover. This report describes and illustrates the gross morphology of all the muscles attaching on the axial, appendicular, or hyoid skeletons, and the integument. The condition in the principal species is compared with those in six other species, chosen to represent the major taxonomic subdivisions within the family. These findings are discussed with regard to systematic studies within the Trochilidae and phylo- genetic relationships of that group to other birds. The authors have indicated the wealth of structural adaptations that are yet to be examined in hummingbirds, and their paper is a solid place to begin. Line drawings, references, index. Migration: Paths Through Time and Space.-R. Robin Baker. 1983. Hodder and Stoughton [England]. 248 p. $15.95 paperback, $32.50 hardcover. Available: Holmes and Meier Publishers, Inc., IUB Building, 30 Irving Pl., New York, NY 10003. This is a sequel to, and offspring of, Baker's The Evolutionary Ecology ofA nimal Migration (1978; noticed in Condor 81:121). In this book, ethologists are taken to task for their insensitive dissection of pro- grammed reflex responses, while population ecologists are criticized for their calculated descriptions of dispersion, gene flow and population regulation mechanisms. To re- place these concepts, we are offered the "individual": less than a population, but more than a set of measurable responses to stimuli. Migration theory, according to Baker, is the description of the life path of an integrated, quite anthropomorphic organism making its way through life, across great distances, while remaining true only to itself. Illustrative material identical to the earlier book. Glossary, references and author indices. -J. Tate.</page></plain_text>
