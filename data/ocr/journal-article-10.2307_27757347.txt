INTRODUCTION The years immediately following the discovery of the Compton effect in late 1922 were ones of intense activity in radiation theory. As E. B. Wilson remarked in 1927, "To cover all the recent speculations on the nature of light would be fairly well to cover the interesting and disputed parts of modern physics."1 At last physicists were forced to take Einstein's neglected 1905 light quantum hypothesis seriously, and to squarely con front the wave-particle dilemma. Interference and diffraction phenomena on the one hand and the photoelectric and Compton effects on the other exemplified two apparently conflicting models of radiation.2 Physicists everywhere realized, as C. D. Ellis put it in 1926, that the "wave-theory itself cannot be correct, but except for its greater age it has no greater claims than the light-quantum view."3 To Niels Bohr, the resolution of this crisis in radiation theory lay in recognizing that wave and particle are complementary but mutually ex clusive manifestations of light. Bohr enunciated his principle of comple mentarity for the first time in the fall of 1927,4 after years of struggling with the problems and paradoxes associated with the creation and interpre *School of Physics and Astronomy and Minnesota Center for Philosophy of Sci ence, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455. 1E.

It centered on the conviction, as H. A. Lorentz ex pressed it in mid-1923, that "it must after all be possible to reconcile the different ideas. Here is an important problem for the physics of the imme diate future. We cannot help thinking that the solution will be found in some happy combination of extended waves and concentrated quanta. . . ."8 The search for this "happy combination"?for some type of constructive theory of radiation that would unite rather than separate wave and particle?was a major theme in Einstein's thought throughout his life. But Einstein was not alone in this quest, at least not in the mid-1920's. Louis de Broglie, Harry Bateman, E. C. Stoner, J. J. Thomson, E. T. Whittaker, J. C. Slater, and W. F. G. Swann were among those who also offered quantitative theories, or qualitative suggestions, designed to reconcile wave and particle.9 Another was Gilbert Newton Lewis, who since 1912 had been dean of the College of Chemistry and chairman of the Department of Chemistry at Berkeley.10 In several respects, Lewis's work on the nature of radiation 5 For discussions of Bohr's work, see Max Jammer, The Conceptual Development of Quantum Mechanics (New York, 1966), pp. 323-345; Martin J.

Kemble, "The General Principles of Quantum Mechanics. Part I," Reviews of Modern Physics, 1 (1929), 158-160. 7Einstein's attempts to find a quantitative constructive theory of radiation began shortly after he introduced his light quantum hypothesis into physics in 1905.

Richards in 1899 at the age of twenty four. He subsequently taught at Harvard for a total of four years, studied for one year in Europe in Wilhelm Ostwald's and Walther Nernst's laboratories, and spent one year in</page><page sequence="3">ROGER H. STUEWER 471 was the most original and distinctive of the pre-complementarity period. First, his initial ideas derived from what he argued was a very general principle of nature, the symmetry of time, and from its implications for detailed balancing in radiative processes. Second, he soon proposed an extremely discerning direct particle interaction theory that was based upon both Einstein's light quantum hypothesis and his special theory of rela tivity. Third, Lewis's ideas in general were often as controversial as they were original. Nevertheless, he advocated them single-mindedly, in spite of strong opposition, as he did for example when he concluded that Einstein's concept of stimulated emission was invalid, and when he realized that his theory of radiation violated common sense notions of causality. Fourth, he was eventually led to introduce a new term, "photon," into physics and chemistry, whose meaning, however, changed very rapidly. Finally, all of his work bears the unmistakable mark of a chemist who attacked some of the most profound questions in physics and chemistry, but at the same time thought and worked in relative isolation from those physicists and chemists who could have contributed most to his understanding. All of these points suggest the significance of an examination of the origin and evolution of Lewis's ideas on the nature of light. 2. DETAILED BALANCING, THE SYMMETRY OF TIME, AND STIMULATED EMISSION The history of what we now commonly call the principle of detailed balancing dates at least to 1911 when P. Kohnstamm and F. E. C. Scheffer concluded that in oppositely directed chemical reactions the same inter a government position in Manilla before A. A. Noyes attracted him in 1905 to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he rapidly advanced through all of the professional ranks and established an international reputation for himself. In 1912 he was called to the University of California at Berkeley, and apart from wartime and other interruptions, he remained at Berkeley for the rest of his life, building there an eminent school of research and teaching.

R. Marcelin (1915), I. Langmuir (1916), Einstein (1917), O. Klein and S. Rosseland (1921), J. Franck (1922 1924), R. H. Fowler (1924), E. A. Milne (1924), P. A. M. Dirac (1924), and R. C. Tolman (1924). Tolman referred to it as the "principle of micro scopic reversibility," and formulated it for a system in thermodynamic equilibrium as follows: "the total number of molecules leaving a given quantum state in unit time shall equal the number arriving in that state in unit time, . . . [and] the number leaving by any one particular path, shall be equal to the number arriving by the reverse of that particular path."12 In January 1925 Lewis introduced his own formulation, calling it the "law of entire equilibrium": "Corresponding to every individual process there is a reverse process, and in a state of equilibrium the average rate of every process is equal to the average rate of its reverse process."13 To illustrate his law, Lewis presented the following "crude analogy": Suppose that during a period in which there are no births or deaths the population of the several cities of the United States remains constant, the number leaving each city being balanced by the number entering it. This stationary condition would not correspond to our case of thermal equilibrium. We would require further, to complete the analogy, that as many people go from New York to Philadelphia as from Philadelphia to New York. If there were three railroad lines between these two cities we should require that the number of passengers going by each line be equal in both directions.14 Lewis's analogy also illustrates Tolman's definition, and hence one might infer that Lewis was familiar with Tolman's work at this time. This, how ever, does not seem to have been the case, since Lewis felt that his was a very original definition.15 What was in fact highly original about it was the 11 Richard C.

STUEWER 473 way in which he deduced it from what he took to be a very general prin ciple of nature, the symmetry of time: The law of entire equilibrium might have been called the law of reversi bility to the last detail. If we should consider any one of the elementary processes which are occurring in a system at equilibrium, and could, let us say, obtain a moving-picture film for such a process, then this film reeled backward would present an equally accurate picture of a reverse process which is also occurring in the system and with equal frequency. Therefore in any system at equilibrium, time must lose the unidirectional character which plays so important a part in the development of the time concept. In a state of equilibrium there is no essential difference between backward and forward direction in time, or, in other words, there is complete symmetry with respect to past and future.16 This contention ran completely counter to the traditional and common sense view of time as the unidirectional flow envisioned by Newton.17 Nevertheless, Lewis repeatedly stressed the importance of the principle of symmetry of time in physics and chemistry. He came to regard it as a heuristic principle of great generality with consequences not only for the theory of thermodynamic equilibria but also for the theory of radiation. Indeed, Lewis's preference for his terminology?the "law of entire equilib rium"?stemmed from his insistence, which he regarded as an original con tribution, that this law must encompass both radiative and nonradiative processes.18 It also had to be applicable, as he remarked with tongue in l6Ibid., pp. 182-183. It may not be quite clear from this quotation that Lewis was actually led to his law of entire equilibrium from his belief in the symmetry of time, but he removed all ambiguity on this point five years later when he stated this fact explicitly in his paper "The Symmetry of Time in Physics," Science, 71 (1930), 576. 17See Newton's Scholium to his Definitions in his Principia, translated by Andrew Motte and reprinted in the Great Books of the Western World (Chicago, 1952), 34, 8. I cannot go into the history and philosophy of the concept of time in physics here, but those who are interested in this subject could begin by consulting Richard Schlegel's Time and the Physical World (East Lansing, 1961), and T. Gold, ed., The Nature of Time (Ithaca, 1967). 18In his same 1930 paper (reference 16, p. 575), Lewis stated explicitly: "I believe I was the first to set up this principle as a universal law in all physics and chemistry, applicable not only to chemical and physical processes involving material substances, but also to processes involving light." The sense in which Lewis inter preted the symmetry of time was always in the sense of motion reversibility, or as we would now say, in the sense that the laws of motion are invariant under a time rever sal transformation (replace t with ~t everywhere). Today, of course, theory and experiment in particle physics treat more directly the question of time reversal invariance.</page><page sequence="6">474 LEWIS ON DETAILED BALANCING cheek, to that "entering wedge of scientific bolshevism, which we call quantum theory. . . ."19 The full application of the law of entire equilibrium to radiant energy seems to me a crucial test of its validity, and since by this application we are going to be led to conclusions of a quite unorthodox character, many will doubtless prefer to deny the law of entire equilibrium rather than abandon many of the accepted laws of radiant energy. But I believe that the law of entire equilibrium will ultimately be recognized as one of the most fundamental of natural laws, and that whatever consequences may be drawn from it must be accepted, even though they contradict well established beliefs.20 To Lewis in May 1925 the major "well established belief" demanding scrutiny was Einstein's concept of stimulated or induced emission, which Einstein had introduced in the course of his famous 1917 derivation of Planck's law.21 Einstein had emphasized that his stimulated emission term was absolutely essential to his derivation, since omitting it and including only the spontaneous absorption and spontaneous emission terms would lead to Wien's, not Planck's, law. After 1917, Bohr had enhanced the im portance of Einstein's work by taking a step Einstein himself had been re luctant to take; Bohr had emphasized the probabilistic implications of Einstein's three coefficients.22 Lewis fully recognized, therefore, that any challenge to Einstein's concept of stimulated emission would be greeted with skepticism and probably with serious criticism. Nevertheless, Lewis was convinced that such a challenge was necessary, because he was con vinced that Einstein's concept of stimulated emission was incompatible with his own law of entire equilibrium. Consider, he argued,23 the problem attacked by Einstein himself, namely, the emission and absorption of 19Gilbert N.

The spontaneous absorption of radiation is accompanied by an atomic transition from a lower energy state Zn to an upper energy state Zm, which Lewis represented symbolically as Zn + hv ? Zm. He then represented the spontaneous emission of radiation, which he took to be the inverse of spontaneous absorption, as Zm ? Zn + hv. Lewis argued that these two inverse pro cesses are completely distinct from the stimulated emission of radiation, since here the atom in its upper state Zm acquires radiant energy hv, a process which must be represented symbolically as Zm + hv ? Zn + 2hv. This transition, Lewis asserted, has no corresponding inverse transition, and hence it "absolutely contradicts the law of entire equ?ibrium"?and with it the symmetry of time. Einstein's concept of stimulated emission therefore had to be discarded. Lewis knew, however, that it was only by including the stimulated emis sion term that Einstein had been able to derive Planck's law. "At first, therefore," Lewis noted, "it would seem that this crucial test of the law of entire equilibrium demonstrates its invalidity." We should, however, "not make this judgment too hastily."24 Instead, we should recall that except for ideal cases chemical thermodynamics teaches us that "equilibrium be tween substances is determined not by their concentration but by a thermodynamically corrected concentration which I have called the activity."25 One should not assume with Einstein that the rate of spon taneous absorption of radiation is proportional to its energy density uv. Instead, one should assume that it is proportional to its "activity" av, which, when represented by am and an for the upper and lower atomic energy states, should be identified with the Boltzmann probabilities of those states. Thus, taking account of two new temperature-independent coefficients Knm and Kmn, Lewis asserted that his law of entire equilib rium required that Knmanav = Kmnam. But this expression is formally identical to Einstein's equilibrium expression without the stimulated emis sion term. Thus, Lewis concluded that his law of entire equilibrium in general implied that the activity av of the radiation is given by Wien's law: n -*1 2-hv/kT n u av - -j v e , v^-1; c where the symbols have their usual meanings. 2*Ibid., p. 425. 2sIbid. Lewis argued that the activity av approaches the ratio uv?hv as the concen trations of both the matter and the radiation approach zero.</page><page sequence="8">476 LEWIS ON DETAILED BALANCING This result could be interpreted, Lewis argued, by recalling the well known formal similarity between Wien's law and the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution in kinetic theory. In the first place, this formal similarity im plied that just as the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution holds only for ideal gases, so equation (2.1) holds only for "ideal radiation." And just as any departure from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution corresponds to a de parture from the ideal gas pressure-volume relationship, so any departure from equation (2.1) corresponds to a departure from the ideal radiation pressure-energy density relationship. Furthermore, just as the Maxwell Boltzmann distribution is based on the assumption that gas molecules interact with each other, so equation (2.1) is based on the assumption that light quanta interact with each other. Lewis supported this conclusion by pointing out that light quanta must interact with each other, at least gravitationally, as a consequence of Einstein's mass-energy relationship. Finally, just as the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is strictly valid only for small collision times, so equation (2.1) is strictly valid only for small interactions or for large frequencies since, as Lewis had concluded earlier in the year, the "cross section" of a light quantum is inversely pro portional to the square of its frequency.26 Taken together, all of the above meant that "we can speak of ideal radia tion in the same sense that we speak of an ideal gas, and that the exact distribution equation for ideal radiation is the Wien equation." "As a corollary it may be pointed out that any equation like Planck's which con forms to Stefan's law and Wien's displacement law, cannot represent actual [ideal] radiation." "Lest, however, it seem that the results of this investi gation are too largely destructive in character, I shall restate, in a different form, the one positive result of the discussion, namely, that in a system of radiation in thermal equilibrium the activity of the radiation follows exactly the Wien distribution formula."27 Not surprisingly, Lewis's "one positive result" struck many other physicists and chemists as a bewildering, if not iconoclastic, negative result. The first to respond was R. C. Tolman, who wrote to Lewis on 26Gilbert N. Lewis and David F. Smith, "The Theory of Reaction Rate," Journal of the Chemical Society of America, 47 (1925), 1515-1517 ["The Size of a Light Quantum"]. Their conclusion was that the light quantum's cross section a = \2/87r = c^ISttv2, which was exactly Rayleigh's classical value; it prompted Lewis to remark that; "If this surmise proves to be correct it will not be the first time that a result ob tained from classical theory has retained its value even after the premises upon which it is based have been abandoned" (pp. 1516-1517). 27Lewis, "Distribution" (reference 20), pp. 427-428.</page><page sequence="9">ROGER H. STUEWER 477 14 May 1925, opening his discussion by commenting on Lewis's law of entire equilibrium: "I talked about the principle during the war with Langmuir at the Cosmos Club, and had a good deal of conversation with Ehrenfest about it last year." But, he added, "I feel some doubt as to the universal applicability of the principle and considerable doubt as to its best formulation. This may be, however, because I haven't thought about it as much as you have."28 Tolman restated his doubts one month later in a second letter to Lewis: "Although I believe that the principle of micro scopic reversibility is a very useful one, I feel that we have got to do some pretty close thinking before we can state it in an acceptable form. I have found a number of cases where the principle certainly does not hold and where statistical equilibrium is certainly maintained by cyclical processes. I am not sure, however, whether they are more than trivial in nature. I also feel uncertain as to the propriety of considering the effect of catalysts on microscopic processes. . . ,"29 It is not entirely clear what cases Tolman had in mind here, but one possibility is the thought experiment he discussed in his 1927 book on statistical mechanics in which he considered a collision between a sphere and a wedge of equal mass, initially at rest. Assuming that the wedge takes up all of the energy of the sphere, Tolman concluded that the inverse of this admittedly "somewhat artificial" collision does not exist, because it "is immediately evident that no single collision is possible which will re turn the sphere and the wedge to states congruent with their original motions."30 Caution therefore had to be exercised in defining and apply ing the principle. Up to this point, Tolman had not yet seen Lewis's criticism of Einstein's concept of stimulated emission. He first became aware of it toward the end of June 1925, when Lewis sent him a copy of his paper along with a copy of a letter Lewis had just received from R. H. Fowler in Cambridge. Tolman expressed his opinion on Lewis's ideas in a final letter to Lewis on 29 June 1925: I am much interested in Fowler's letter and your article. I have not yet had time to go over the article carefully. At first sight, however, I feel 28Tolman to Lewis, 14 May 1925, Lewis Correspondence, College of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley. 29Tolman to Lewis, 13 June 1925, Lewis Correspondence, Berkeley. 30Richard C.

This doubt less will be very pleasing to you. And it certainly is one criterion of progress that the new shall be different enough from the old so as to offend conservatives such as myself. In particular it seems to me that you do not give sufficient weight to the fact that the Planck radiation law can be derived by applying the Wilson-Sommerfeld rules of quantiza tion to the modes of vibration of a holraum [sic], combined with ordi nary statistical mechanical treatment. Since I myself lay great stress on this simple derivation of the radiation law, which does not go into the mechanism of light emission and absorption, I feel that we must be very friendly to Einstein's attempts to find a mechanism of absorption and emission which will give exactly the same law.31 The extent to which Tolman agreed with Fowler on this point may be seen from Fowler's letter to Lewis: Trinity College, Cambridge June 6 Dear Lewis, Many thanks for your nice letter, &amp; the copy of your next paper to the Academy on this subject. Yes I do agree that you are taking the principle more strictly at its face value &amp; carrying it to its logical consequences further than anyone has done before. And there certainly are points of difficulty in Einstein's stimulated emissions. They don't appear in con nection with the ordinary switches between definite levels, but in the photoelectric effect &amp; its converse treated by Milne. When you try &amp; calculate the mean absorption coefficient of hot material in ionizative equilibrium ?V include the stimulated captures you get into difficulties. Milne himself hasn't got clear on the point, which I only knew of from discussions with him, so I can't make myself more explicit. All the same my impression is that the Einstein coefficients are essentially correct &amp; give the right picture of what the atoms are doing &amp; that insofar as you regard this as denying the law of entire eqra then I would take the view of denying that law for radiative processes. I am inclined to think that it may be necessary to distinguish between two types of process [es], one in which (like ordinary slow collisions) there is conservation of energy &amp; momentum in detail &amp; reversibility to the last detail &amp; the other type where there is no conservation &amp; no reversibility?(except statistically). 31 Tolman to Lewis, 29 June 1925, Lewis Correspondence, Berkeley.</page><page sequence="11">ROGER H. STUEWER 479 Radiative processes are a case in point for I don't regard light quanta as a possible alternate basis for the wave theory of light (which any theory has got to reproduce) &amp; then as you point out E's coefficients cant tell the whole story &amp; the process cant be reversed in detail without con verging spherical waves. [These ideas are derived from Bohr. I dont know if they are right or not, &amp; I believe he would hedge himself.] The reason why I believe that the stimulated emissions ought to come in in Einstein's way, is that only so does the quantum description of line-emission &amp; absorption fit in with the classical picture. There is a very good paper by Van Vleck in the Physical Review 1924 I think which does a great deal to make this correspondence clear. Apart from this I would really be rather tempted to follow your new application &amp; stick to the reversibility law at all costs, but as it is I be lieve the picture so drawn would be wrong. Yours v. sincerely RH Fowler32 Fowler's reference to the 1924 paper of J. H. Van Vleck33 at the Uni versity of Minnesota requires immediate comment. Defining the differen tial absorption of an atom to be the excess of stimulated absorption over stimulated emission for corresponding upward and downward transitions, Van Vleck proved that the quantum expression for the ratio of differential absorption to spontaneous emission asymptotically approaches, at large quantum numbers, the classical value of the ratio of absorption to emis sion. There is, therefore, a close correspondence between the quantum and classical theories of emission and absorption of radiation. Hence, Van Vleck's paper should have prompted Lewis to reexamine thoroughly his rejection of Einstein's concept of stimulated emission, since Van Vleck proved in effect that Einstein's concept was absolutely essential to main tain reversibility and hence to maintain Lewis's law of entire equilibrium in quantum radiative processes. Lewis did not read Van Vleck's paper and therefore did not understand 32Fowler to Lewis, 6 June [1925], Lewis Correspondence, Berkeley. Fowler, of course, was an expert on these questions; his 1923-1924 Adams Prize Essay at the University of Cambridge was enlarged into his Statistical Mechanics (Cambridge, 1929). On p. 436, he cites Lewis's work and claims that detailed balancing is now (1929) regarded as generally valid. In the 2nd edition (1936), p. 660, he makes an even stronger statement. 33J. H.

For the time being he was most concerned with the other main point that Fowler had raised; namely, that his law of entire equilibrium may be valid only for nonradiative, nonstatistical processes since the con servation laws may not hold in microscopic interactions, a suggestion that Bohr had recently brought to the forefront of physics in the Bohr Kramers-Slater paper of 1924.34 Lewis expressed his views on this point when he answered Fowler's letter on 25 June 1925: "I believe," he wrote, "that in spite of the interference of light which presents difficulties of a most serious character, that eventually we are going to establish the prin ciple of entire equilibrium and maintain the conservation laws, although perhaps the wish is father to the thought."35 Two months passed before Fowler replied to Lewis. By that time new facts had come into Fowler's possession which, in his opinion, placed Lewis's work in an entirely new light: Trinity College Cambridge Aug 30 Dear Prof Lewis, I read your second note on reversible processes &amp; the Activity' of radiation with a good deal of interest &amp; some scepticism (I admit), but my scepticism has recently been considerably weakened by a new line of attack which seems to be going ahead. Its nothing to do with me, &amp; very likely you have already noted it (with pleasure I am sure) but in case you have not I thought I would point out some of the main papers for your notice. The original idea is a statistical one &amp; reinterprets the Einstein coeffi cients in a way which must be extremely like your point of view. This is in a paper by a Hindoo?Bose Zeit f?r Phys 27 p 384. published about a year ago. I am not yet prepared to say I fully appreciate the full implica tions as I have only just come across it. It involves radical changes in the proper [ ? ] way of making the calculations of statistical mechanics which will certainly be interesting to follow up. But the same idea has already been taken up &amp; developed in gas theory by Einstein, Sitzungsberichte 34N. Bohr, H. A. Kramers, and J. C.

Einstein himself would have thoroughly disputed Fowler's contention had he been aware of it. Lewis once again did not take Fowler's advice to familiarize himself with Bose's and Einstein's papers, since he was extremely pressured for time in the summer and fall of 1925. He wrote Fowler on 29 October 1925 that "I have been obliged to give practically all my thought to the Silliman Lectures which I am going to give at Yale University next month."38 In spite of his general reluctance to deliver public lectures,39 Lewis looked forward with a great deal of pleasure to delivering the Silliman Lectures at Yale. He relished the thought, as J. L. Hildebrand has observed, of doing "his best to shock scientific prejudices in several fields."40 For Lewis the most important of these fields now was radiation theory, and he was determined, as he wrote Fowler, to go well beyond his past work and "resolve the serious paradox between quantum theory and wave theory." He added: "I do not expect many people to accept my views immediately, 36Fowler to Lewis, 30 August [1925], Lewis Correspondence, Berkeley. 37[S.

DIRECT PARTICLE INTERACTION AND SPECIAL RELATIVITY "Sir, to leave things out of a book, merely because people tell you they will not be believed, is meanness." So said Johnson to Boswell, and so said Lewis to the readers of his Silliman Lecture on "Light and the Quantum" when he published it in 1926.42 Although he recognized that his ideas were radical, Lewis nevertheless considered them to be of the utmost im portance; he published them in three different places: in his book The Anatomy of Science, which constituted his Silliman Lectures,43 in Nature,44 and in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 4S He stated that some might regard his ideas as "extremely repugnant to common sense." He also freely admitted that since they had not yet "run the gauntlet of scientific criticism," they might turn out to be "thoroughly erroneous." "Often," he remarked, "a 'watcher of the skies' beholds some brilliant nova which later proves to be only a candle on a neighboring hillside."46 The general state of affairs in radiation theory in 1925-1926 invited speculation, however, since its very foundation had been challenged. "Re cent experiments, especially those of A. H. Compton," Lewis observed, "have fully corroborated Einstein's brilliant surmise that the energy of radiation consists of quanta."47 The knowledge that Einstein's twenty year-old "heuristic viewpoint" finally had to be taken seriously prompted repeated attempts to resolve the wave-particle dilemma, the most famous and fruitful of which no doubt was J. C. Slater's 1924 virtual radiation 41 Lewis to Fowler, 29 October 1925, Lewis Correspondence, Berkeley. 42Gilbert N. Lewis, The Anatomy of Science (New Haven, 1926), p. 113.

STUEWER 483 field concept48 which soon led to the Bohr-Kramers-Slater paper.49 It was in this generally speculative atmosphere that Lewis advanced his own ideas. Lewis felt that approaches like Slater's and Swann's that considered the possibility of assigning a virtual, classical-like Poynting vector field as a guide for light quanta had one major drawback: since light quanta were assumed to propagate rectilinearly, they could not follow the "tortuous path of the Poynting vector" in an interference field.50 Even if the Poyn ting vector field were to determine only the points at which quanta strike a receiving screen, "we are met by contradiction." Thus, Lewis considered a typical two-slit arrangement, and supposed that a given quantum can strike a certain point on the screen only when the upper slit is open, but cannot strike that point when both slits are open. He suggested that one start the experiment with only the upper slit open, and then suddenly open the lower slit also. The Poynting field that was thereby suddenly ad mitted through the lower slit could not "tell" a quantum passing through the upper slit not to go to the forbidden point. For to do so, the field would have to intercept the quantum at some point between the upper slit and the forbidden point on the screen; but by then the quantum's tra jectory had already been determined, and hence it was necessarily on its way to the forbidden point. The more we think about this contradiction, Lewis wrote, the more "the hardly credible thought" occurs to us "that in some manner the atom in the source . . . can foretell before it emits its quantum of light whether one or both of the slits . . . are going to be open."51 Although it sounded "absurd," this was the basic idea that Lewis would attempt to develop into a consistent theory of light. And since his theory would clearly involve fundamental challenges to our common sense notions of temporal order and hence of causality, it was imperative for Lewis at the very outset to present a clear picture of the concept of time in physics. "There is," Lewis observed, "some discrepancy between the equations of mathematical physics and the less formal physical explanations with which we are accustomed to annotate them. The equations themselves recognise no distinction between positive and negative extension in time; they are symmetrical. But, in the language of physics, a great distinction is made between past and future."52 Mechanical systems run backward in 48J. C.

Only radiative processes have in the past seemed to be temporally asymmetric, but "we now know that this is not the case, and in advancing the theorem of 'entire equilibrium,' I have recently shown how we may consider all these elementary processes as completely re versible and symmetrical with respect to past and future."53 The key to understanding radiative processes, therefore, lay in recogniz ing that time is symmetric. Lewis required two further assumptions, how ever: first, that an emitting atom loses energy only in the form of a particle of energy hv, momentum hv\c, and mass hv/c2, which travels rectilinearly to an absorbing atom unless deflected, in which case the conservation laws of energy, momentum, and mass are obeyed; and second, that a single light particle emitted from a single atom is subject to the laws of interference.54 Compton's experiments lent plausibility to the first of these assumptions, Taylor's experiments to the second. The crux of the matter was to couple these two assumptions with that of the symmetry of time. To do so, Lewis denied that an atom simply radiates "into space," but rather that an atom never emits light except to another atom, and . . . that it is as absurd to think of light emitted by one atom regardless of the exis tence of a receiving atom as it would be to think of an atom absorbing light without the existence of light to be absorbed. I propose to eliminate the idea of mere emission of light and substitute the idea of transmission, or a process of exchange of energy between two definite atoms or mole cules. Now, if the process be regarded as a mere exchange, the law of entire equilibrium . . . requires us to consider the process as a perfectly symmetrical one, so that we can no longer regard one atom as an active agent and the other as an accidental and passive recipient, but both atoms must play coordinate and symmetrical parts in the process of exchange.55 s^Ibid. 54Lewis, "Nature" (reference 45), p. 22. 55Ibid., pp. 24-25.

STUEWER 485 This perfect symmetry between emitter and absorber, between past and future, led directly to a causal paradox. Lewis considered the following illustration: "The light from a distant star is absorbed, let us say, by a molecule of chlorophyl which has recently been produced in a living plant. We say that the light from the star was on its way toward us a thousand years ago. What rapport can there be between the emitting source and this newly made molecule of chlorophyl?"56 If we suppose for the sake of argument that the star served as the source of light in the tw?-slit experi ment above, and that the absorbing molecule of chlorophyl was placed precisely at the forbidden point on the screen, then, if both slits were suddenly opened to the starlight, could we thereby have prevented the light from being originally emitted? "If so it would mean that we could, perhaps in a trivial way, but nevertheless in principle, alter the course of past events."57 Perhaps the most striking feature of Lewis's ideas, including the above causal paradox, was that they could be regarded as a "natural" and "in deed inevitable" extension of Einstein's special theory of relativity. Lewis, who was proud to recall that it was he who in 1909 had presented the first paper on relativity before the American Physical Society,58 was thoroughly familiar with Einstein's theory. He now considered a Minkowski diagram representing the four-dimensional manifold of special relativity (Figure 1). As usual, in the diagram the time axis OT, one spatial axis OX, and the light cone OL, for which the four-dimensional distance ds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2 - c2dt2 = 0, are shown on a two-dimensional plot. Any line drawn from the origin O to a point inside the light cone TOL is called a time-like line and represents the locus of a material particle, since in this region ds2 &lt; 0, and the slope dx/dt of any such line is always less than c, the velocity of light. Any line drawn from the origin O to a point outside the 56Lewis, "Nature" (reference 45), p. 25. si Ibid. 58Lewis, Anatomy (reference 42), p. 85. Lewis was here referring either to his paper "A Revision of the Fundamental Laws of Matter and Energy," Phil. Mag., 16 (1908), 705-717, which apparently formed the basis for his talk "Non-Newtonian Mechanics" at the 24 October 1908, New York meeting of the American Physical Society, or to his paper (written with R. C. Tolman) "The Principle of Relativity and Non-Newtonian Mechanics," Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 44 (1909), 711-724.

The line OL is unique. It is the line for which ds2 = 0, and for which the slope dx/dt = c. "Now," Lewis wrote, "in spite of the symmetry demanded by the geometry we affiliate the line OL with the time-like lines and say that it represents the velocity of light. As a con cession to traditional thought we do violence to our geometry when we call the light process a form of motion at all; and while we shall continue to make this concession, it will be with a realization of the unique charac ter of radiation."59 To represent both the emission and absorption of radiation, two Min kowski diagrams are required, one for the emitting atom, and one for the absorbing atom. Suppose that the lines OT and QL represent the space time loci of these two atoms (Figure 2). Suppose further that the inter cepts O and L, and O and Q, are on the light cones, and hence are joined by lines OL and OQ of zero four-dimensional length (ds2 = 0). This is an idea, Lewis observed, "of which much use has been made in the mathe 59Lewis, "Nature" {reference 45), p. 26.</page><page sequence="19">ROGER H. STUEWER 487 rr \ Figure 2.

The proposals which I am making . . . are tantamount to assuming that such a distance is also zero in a physical sense, and that two atoms whose loci are OT and QL may be said to be in virtual contact at any two points such as O and L or O and Q, which are connected by singular lines."60 For example, "I may say that my eye touches a star, not in the same sense as when I say that my hand touches a pen, but in an equally physical sense."61 In other words, when "two atoms are in ordinary physical contact we do not inquire how one atom ascertains that the other is in a position to receive energy, nor need we so inquire in the case of virtual contact, even though the time of emis sion and the time of absorption are said to be separated by thousands of years. Such a statement depends upon an arbitrary choice of a time axis. If in our figure we should take, not OT, but time axes lying nearer and nearer 60Ibid. 61 Lewis, "Light Waves," (reference 44), p. 237.</page><page sequence="20">488 LEWIS ON DETAILED BALANCING to OL, not only the time elapsing between O and L but also their spatial distance would approach zero."62 The symmetry of the transmission process, which was also embedded in the so-called retarded and advanced potentials, and which owed its origin to the symmetry of time, was therefore beautifully reflected in the sym metry of special relativity. It was only through "our notion of causality" that a "dissymmetry alien to the pure geometry of relativity" had been introduced into physics. But if relativity had taught us anything, it had taught us to be wary of common sense notions of space and time. And indeed, Lewis felt that relinquishing these common sense notions was a small price to pay for a theory that was capable of yielding quantitative predictions of radiative transmission processes. These predictions potentially included quantitative predictions of the probability of transmission of radiation from one atom to another. For, Lewis argued, if one were to draw the world-lines of two atoms, A and B, in virtual contact with each other and capable of emitting and absorbing energy hp, respectively, these world-lines would assume the form of two helices of equal radius with axes parallel to each other (Figure 363). One could then connect a point A' on the axis of one helix to a point B* on the axis of the other with a singular line and associate the relative difference in the positions of these points with a relative difference in phase between the two atoms. One could also mentally project each helix onto a plane, where the projected figure would ordinarily be an ellipse but would turn into a circle for one particular characteristic orientation of the plane, and associate the relative angular orientations of these two characteristic planes with the relative polarizations of the atoms. "Thus we speak not of the phase and polarization of light but of the relative phase and relative polar ization of the atoms themselves; and we shall assume that the chance that the atom B accepts radiation from A depends upon these two quantities, and upon the distance between A and B."64 The analysis could also be extended to encompass the reflection of light from a mirror C; in fact, it could be extended to encompass all of the "quantitative laws of optics." However, Lewis would reserve the extensions of his theory for "another communication." Meanwhile, the question arose whether or not it was possible to test Lewis's theory experimentally. This question was particularly important vis-?-vis theories like Slater's or Swann's in which a Poynting vector field 62Lewis, "Nature" (reference 45), o. 26. 63Ibid., p. 27. 64Jfc?d, pp. 27-28.</page><page sequence="21">ROGER H. STUEWER 489 C A R ij ) Figure 3. Lewis's diagram illustrating two atoms in virtual contact with each other. seemed to play a role. Fortunately, Lewis wrote, "there is a crucial experi ment [between such theories and mine] which does not seem absolutely beyond the reach of our present experimental technique."65 Consider a bi-mirror experiment (Figure 4) in which the mirrors AA' and BB' have been adjusted to produce a bright fringe at D and a dark fringe at C. Sup pose now that the mirror AA! is suspended by a torsion wire, and that its 65Ibid., p. 28.</page><page sequence="22">490 LEWIS ON DETAILED BALANCING Figure 4. Lewis's bi-mirror experiment. width is only one half the screen distance CD. Then, Lewis asserted, on the one hand, the Poynting vector field (and hence the radiation pressure) would be uniform across the mirror A?. On the other hand, according to Lewis's theory light quanta should strike point A (en route to the bright fringe) but should not strike point A' (en route to the dark fringe). Given these experimental conditions, Lewis's theory, in contrast to Slater's or Swann's, predicted that the mirror AA* would experience a torque. Lewis recognized that his theory was very bold and speculative. He wrote Paul Ehrenfest on 4 February 1926: "As you know, I do not follow the fashion much in physics and chemistry, but take a path of my own, which I do not doubt often leads nowhere. But I have a feeling that in this paper on radiation I have hit upon something pretty fundamental, and I should like very much to have your opinion. I think you are one of the few men who will not condemn them instantly and without a hearing."66 Lewis provided a more sober statement of the importance he attached to his 66Lewis to Ehrenfest, 4 February 1926. This letter is actually dated 4 February 1925, but it is clear from its contents that this was a typographical error.</page><page sequence="23">ROGER H. STUEWER 491 theory when he summarized it for publication. It "goes a long way," he wrote, "toward bringing closer correlation between our physical and our geometrical concepts; it emphasizes the unique character of the singular lines (motion of light), it makes physical use of the theorem of zero dis tance along singular lines, and it does away with that distinction between past and future which, however useful it may be in other cases, seems to have no significance in a purely reversible process."67 4. REACTIONS TO LEWIS'S THEORY The response to Lewis's theory was immediate and varied. Some com ments and criticisms, of course, were too general to be illuminating. For example, one "outer layman," who identified himself only by the initials F. P., could not fathom how Lewis's theory helped to understand ques tions such as "how does polarization separate the whole light into two parts vibrating at right angles?"68 William Band, a physicist at the Uni versity of Liverpool, supported Lewis's ideas in general but thought that it would be "more intelligible and more in accordance with the historical development of physics" if instead of concentrating only on the end points of the causal chain?the emitting and absorbing atoms?Lewis also took into account other intervening elements like lenses or diffracting obsta cles.69 C. D. Ellis termed Lewis's theory "an original view on the whole problem,"70 and E. B. Wilson, sharing Ellis's enthusiasm, considered it to be "a reasonable interpretation of the mathematics fundamental to rela tivity."71 Only three days after Lewis's paper had appeared in Nature (13 February 1926), Niels Bohr had also studied it and reported his impressions of Lewis's theory in a letter to O. W. Richardson: "Every day seems the 67Lewis, "Nature" (reference 45), pp. 26-27. 68F. P., "What isa Beam of Light?"

Thomson's 1903 suggestion of a positive and nega tive charge being connected by a Faraday tube which transmits electromagnetic pulses between them. At the same time, he was skeptical of Thomson's current views: "All we need now," he asserted, "is to have some physicist who has read up the new psychology as a minor tell us that the Faraday tube that draws the negative and positive electricity together is but a gross materialization of the real funda mental force of nature, the sex instinct, and our molecules have become as in humanly lewd as we are alleged to be!"

I am just reading a paper of Lewis which suggests ideas which we have often touched upon in our discussions here [in Copenhagen], but considered too wild to follow up more closely. Still I wonder what progress may be obtained in that way, and it shall be very interesting to see Lewis' more detailed publications."72 Richardson replied: "I think there is a good deal of nonsense in Lewis's ideas if I have understood them properly."73 The first physicist to offer detailed criticisms of Lewis's ideas was, once again, R. C. Tolman. Tolman wrote to Lewis on 9 March 1926 that al though he felt "sympathetic" to Lewis's "point of view," he could not agree with the conclusiveness of Lewis's "proposed crucial experiment."74 Tolman specified his reasons nine days later in an article written jointly with Sinclair Smith.75 Tolman and Smith suggested that a dark fringe on one edge of the receiving screen in Lewis's setup and a bright fringe on the other did not necessarily mean that no light quanta were traveling to the dark edge, but only that they produced no observable effects there. As in the Lippmann process of color photography, standing wave patterns ex tending into the screen could be present at both edges, with an antinode at the surface of the screen at the bright edge and a node at the surface of the screen at the dark edge. Hence, equal numbers of quanta could actually strike both edges of the screen as well as both edges of the suspended mirror, which would mean that even on Lewis's theory the mirror would experience "the same or nearly the same forces ... as would be predicted from the wave theory."76 Lewis reacted almost immediately to Tolman's and Smith's suggestion,77 calling it "untenable" for the following reason. Consider a thought experi ment in which the receiving screen was replaced by a thin calorimeter of equal width after the interference pattern had been established.

Tolman and Sinclair Smith, "Nature of Light" (reference 55), pp. 343-347. Tolman and Smith suggested (p. 347) that perhaps one "heuristically adequate" way of reconciling quanta with the wave theory would be to assume that the waves "carry no appreciable energy but provide the signaling system by which in accordance with the laws of interference the atoms can 'know' whether or not they are allowed to interact with an oncoming [energy carrying] quantum." 16Ibid., p. 346. 77Gilb?rt N.

STUEWER 493 ing to the usual wave theory, the bright edge of the calorimeter would heat up, while the dark edge would not. According to Tolman's and Smith's suggestion, however, since quanta, and hence energy, would ac tually strike the dark as well as the bright edge of the calorimeter, both edges would heat up. Conservation of energy would be violated therefore, since "the total amount of energy arriving at the plate . . . [would be] largely increased merely by the interposition of the optical apparatus which produces interference." Lewis concluded that Tolman's and Smith's objections were invalid and that his crucial experiment would indeed yield a "positive result." Lewis submitted his refutation of Tolman's and Smith's argument for publication on 31 May 1926. He evidently also sent a preprint to Tolman, because on 3 June Tolman replied to Lewis by letter as follows: "Dr. Smith and I do not agree that our suggestions involve any contradiction to the principle of the conservation of energy. In case the screen is highly opaque, we believe that quanta falling at the center of a dark band would be deflected on passage through the surface of the screen to regions where absorption is permitted by the wave theory."78 Tolman went on to cite a passage in his and Smith's paper which permitted this interpretation of their views. "Our position then is," Tolman concluded, "that the theory which you have adopted, the failure of your proposed crucial experiment, and the conservation of energy, are all three compatible propositions."79 Tolman's rejoinder, which he soon published,80 might have precipitated yet a further response from Lewis, but it did not. Nor was the issue settled experimentally, as it might have been. Rather, it was settled?along with the fate of Lewis's entire theory?through correspondence with Al bert Einstein. Nothing, of course, could have been more natural than for Lewis to seek Einstein's opinion on his theory of radiation. The theory itself was solidly based upon both Einstein's special theory of relativity and his light quan tum hypothesis. Moreover, Lewis had had the highest possible respect and admiration for Einstein ever since Lewis had experienced the "thrill of excitement" when first studying the "strange but alluring doctrine" of relativity.81 Early in his career, evidently between 1909-1911 or 1912 78Tolman to Lewis, 3 June 1926, Lewis Correspondence, Berkeley.

Lewis wrote Einstein that his law of entire equilibrium and its applica tion to black body radiation were "based essentially upon your own ideas" and "probably owe their origin to a conversation that I had with you in Zurich many years ago. ..." He was now trying to carry them "a little far ther than anyone has ventured to do hitherto," and as a result had been led to a conclusion which "is not in accord with . . . your derivation of the Planck distribution law." Finally,"Lewis told Einstein: "The paper on The Nature of Light I should like very much to get your views upon. Although I state that it is an extension of your principle of relativity, it may be a step that you would be quite unwilling to take. I hesitated a good deal be fore accepting it, but am now thoroughly convinced that it is correct, and that although it is not the whole truth it does make a fair beginning to ward eliminating the paradox of the quantum."84 Few subjects were as close to Einstein's heart, and less than one month later, on 22 August, he replied to Lewis. Einstein's letter provides detailed insight not only into Lewis's ideas, but also into the evolution of Einstein's own thought: 22. VIII. 26. Dear Mr. Gilbert Lewis: Many thanks for your letter and your papers, which I read with great pleasure. The ideas you suggest in "The Nature of Light" are the same as I have agonizingly turned over in my own mind without coming to a conclusion. Also, the idea of a direct action with respect to the four dimensional distance 0 appears extremely tempting; what is sad, how ever, is that if A - B = 0 and B - C = 0 (more precisely, if =0; SBC ~ 0)&gt; tnen A ~ C (sac) Is nevertheless not [necessarily] 0. And yet, the action from A to C via a mirror B is just as intense as if A and C 82 Lewis seems never to have specified an exact date for his visit, although he men tions the visit itself explicitly in his letter of 27 July 1926 to Einstein.

STUEWER 495 would have a four-dimensional distance of zero. One should really carry out your mirror experiment . . .; unfortunately, it is as good as certain? in spite of all of the difficulties in understanding it?that the time average of all radiation pressures behaves according to Maxwell's theory. I am completely convinced of the validity of your "law of entire equilibrium." But I can not agree with your opinion that this law proves the incorrectness of my derivation of Planck's law. That this Une of argument may not be so easily applied here is due to the fact that no mechanism is imaginable which catalytically favors the spontaneous emission [freie Ausstrahlung], but not the stimulated absorption and stimulated emission [positive und negative Einstrahlung]. One must re gard spontaneous emission and stimulated emission, on the one hand, and stimulated absorption, on the other hand, as inverse processes. I do not agree with your distinction that according to the law of mass action stimulated emission is regarded as a reaction in which two quanta are involved (Zm + hv = Zn + 2hv). I think that the law of mass action ceases to be applicable in its simple form in the non-Wienian radiation region, or for degenerate gases. In formulating my [1917] theory, I myself found the non-evident reversibility of my statistical mechanism unpleasant, and I have empha sized this point in lectures. But this is not in fact an objection. To see this one only has to consider the radiative equilibrium state of an oscilla tor in a Jeanian radiation field, where one can operate with classical theory, and where one can use considerations completely analogous to those in my paper. In so doing one is certain from the very beginning that one is to remain in the region of strictly reversible processes. (Mechanics and Maxwell's equations). If one considers an oscillator of energy E during a short time r, such that during this time the percentage change in E is infinitely small, its energy changes 1) by spontaneous emission 2) by absorption of radiation (work done by the external radiation field on the oscillator). The sign in front of the absorbed radiation de pends on the phase of the oscillator, and is therefore just as probably positive as negative. My theory is nothing but the appropriate transformation of this idea into quantum theory. In view of this consideration, it is actually impos sible to omit the stimulated emission, and it is therefore in no way an ad hoc assumption.

Meanwhile, I remain, with best wishes, your A. Einstein85 Einstein's criticisms were clearly devastating. The thrust of his remarks on Lewis's direct interaction theory of radiation was that if two atoms A and C were in virtual contact (in Lewis's sense) via a mirror jB, they would not in general be in virtual contact in the absence of the mirror: the two four-dimensional distances sab anc* sbc mav be individually zero, without having the direct four-dimensional distance s?\ c equal to zero, as may readily be seen by an example.86 Hence, on Lewis's theory, the radiative coupling between two atoms A and C could be radically different depend ing on whether or not the transmitted quanta were reflected from a mirror?a consequence which is inconsistent with some of the simplest optical phenomena. Einstein's remarks on the conclusions Lewis drew from his law of entire equilibrium were equally devastating. The correspondence between classi cal and quantum radiative processes, which Einstein had already hinted at in his 1917 paper, and which clearly revealed the need for the stimulated emission term, was the same correspondence that Van Vleck had empha sized in his 1924 paper and which Fowler had drawn to Lewis's atten tion.87 As a corollary, Einstein's remarks were in sharp disagreement with Fowler's suggestion that Bose's derivation of Planck's law seriously weakened the classical-quantum link. Lewis took Einstein's criticisms very seriously. When he answered Einstein's letter on 3 November 1926, he opened on a note of capitulation: "Owing to our isolation here [at Berkeley] I am afraid I spend a good deal of time puzzling out questions which have already been solved by others. I wish that I could hear more frequently the informal opinions of those who are studying the same problems that I am."88 In spite of his pub lished promise, Lewis never developed his theory of light further along the lines he had indicated. Rather, his researches on radiation theory took 85Einstein to Lewis, 22 August 1926, Lewis Correspondence, Berkeley.

STUEWER 497 quite a different turn,89 although his ultimate views on the subject were determined by his firm belief in the symmetry of time. Lewis also recognized the force of Einstein's criticisms of his law of en tire equilibrium as applied to radiative processes. He admitted to Einstein: "I can not so easily dispose of your argument regarding 'negative Einstrah lung' [stimulated emission]. While I do not believe that there is any energy in the undulating field of radiation, the existence of such a field can not be ignored, for it is by means of this field that we can predict all of the phenomena of interference." Thus, even if the field were an energyless probability field, "there would still be a phenomenon relating to the prob abilities quite analogous to the 'Einstrahlung' [absorption] and 'Ausstrah lung' [emission] of energy, and it might be argued that these have to be taken into consideration just as you have done."90 In the end, however, Lewis could not bring himself to fully admit the validity of Einstein's concept of stimulated emission. He could not con vince himself that it would be "possible to reconcile this idea of reversibil ity to the last detail with the classical picture of radiation," because he could not understand how spherical waves could be observed to spread out from a source without ever being observed to contract back into it. He hinted that he might have to abandon his earlier assumption that the proba bility of transmission of radiation depends only upon the relative phases and polarization of the emitting and absorbing atoms; "other similar pro cesses" might also have to be taken into account. These processes in turn would perhaps produce those equilibrium conditions which Einstein in 1912 had termed "aussergewohnlich,"91 and which would correspond to an "extended thermodynamics." 89Tt is worth remarking that if Lewis had not preserved his correspondence, we would have very little idea of why he redirected his research program, since he does not discuss this point in his published papers. 90Lewis to Einstein, 3 November 1926, Lewis Correspondence, Berkeley. 91 In this connection Lewis later cited Einstein's papers "Thermodynamische Begr?ndung des photochemischen Aquivalentsgesetzes," Annalen der Physik, 38 (1912), 881-884, and "Deduction thermodynamique de la loi de l'?quivalence photochimique," Journal de physique, 3 (1913), 277-282. The second paper is not a translation of the first. Lewis brought out what he meant by these "aussergew?hnlich" states by considering a box containing radiation and having perfectly reflecting walls, one of which is so thin that radiation pressure fluctuations can cause it to undergo a sort of Brownian motion. At thermal equilibrium there would be no interchange of energy on the average between the enclosed radiation, the thin wall, and the outside surroundings; but, Lewis argued, the radiation would have a definite frequency distribution owing to the Doppler shifts it experiences in its approach to equilibrium.

"It is pretty extreme quantum theory," Lewis remarked, "but I think you may find it amusing, and the extended thermodynamics which I discuss there might be built up quite without regard to the 'photon' hypothesis."92 5. THE CONSERVATION OF PHOTONS Lewis published his "pretty extreme quantum theory" and its associated "extended thermodynamics" in a long letter to the editor o? Nature dated 29 October 1926,93 and in two papers he communicated to the Proceed ings of the National Academy of Sciences on 6 April and 18 April 1927.94 Einstein's criticisms had forced him to reevaluate his ideas on the nature of radiative processes and to drop some of his ideas altogether, but neither his interest in the subject nor his research on it had been truncated. The major feature of radiative processes which Lewis felt could with stand Einstein's criticisms was that "a new kind of atom" was involved in them. This "atom" had to be "an identifiable entity, uncreatable and indestructible, which acts as the carrier of radiant energy and, after ab sorption, persists as an essential constituent of the absorbing atom until it is later sent out again bearing a new amount of energy."95 It was for this "atom," this "entity," that Lewis coined a new name: It would seem inappropriate to speak of one of these hypothetical enti ties as a particle of light, a corpuscle of light, a light quantum, or a light quant, if we are to assume that it spends only a minute fraction of its existence as a carrier of radiant energy, while the rest of the time it remains as an important structural element within the atom. It would also cause confusion to call it merely a quantum, for later it will be necessary to distinguish between the number of these entities present in an atom and the so-called quantum number. I therefore take the liberty equilibrium, all at the same temperature, according to the amount of energy originally in the enclosure, and only one of these states coincides with the state of black body radiation, which is alone considered in the classical [i.e., Planck's] thermodynamics of radiation." The other states presumably were the "aussergewohnlich" states. See Lewis's paper "A New Equation for the Distribution of Radiant Energy," Proc. Nat. Acad. ScL, 13 (1926), 473. 92 Lewis to Einstein, 3 November 1926, Lewis Correspondence, Berkeley. 93Gilbert N. Lewis, "The Conservation of Photons," Nature, 118 (1926), 874-875. 94Gilbert N.

STUEWER 499 of proposing for this hypothetical new atom, which is not light but plays an essential part in every process of radiation, the name photon.96 Lewis attached six major properties to his "photon": (1) In any isolated system the total number of photons is constant. (2) All radiant energy is carried by photons. ... (3) All photons are identical. ... (4) The energy of an isolated photon, divided by the Planck constant, gives the frequency of the photon, which is therefore by definition strictly monochromatic. . . . (5) All photons are alike in one property which has the dimensions of action or of angular momen tum, and is invariant to a relativity transformation. (6) The condition that the frequency of a photon emitted by a certain system be equal to some physical frequency existing within that system, is not in general fulfilled, but comes nearer to fulfilment the lower the frequency is.97 Clearly, Lewis's "photon" was not Einstein's light quantum. Lewis stated that his "photon" "is not light but plays an essential part in every process of radiation." The most striking aspect of Lewis's concept was his conten tion that in "any isolated system the total number of photons is constant." He considered this property to be central to his concept, entitling his article "The Conservation of Photons." Indeed, this property would soon become the basis of the "extended thermodynamics" he mentioned to Einstein. First, however, Lewis felt compelled to allay two possible "serious objections" to it. The first arose out of the thermodynamics of black body radiation. Consider a Hohlraum containing black body radiation of definite energy E and temperature T, where E ~ T4, and imagine that the Hohlraum undergoes a free expansion which increases its volume by a factor of 16 = 24. This implied, Lewis asserted, that if the radiation were then "brought to a new temperature equilibrium by introducing an infinites imal black body," the total number of photons present would change by a factor of 2.98 To now insist on photon conservation, Lewis had to reject a postulate "tacitly employed" by Wien and Planck, but one "which is sup ported by no experimental facts; namely, if an infinitesimal black body is introduced into a hohlraum, the radiation will come to a certain tempera ture, and then no further change will ensue when a large black body of the same temperature is introduced." By "dispensing with this postulate, and **Ibid. ^Ibid. 98 Lewis actually said that the number of photons would double, but his argument here is not very clear to me; rather than lose his main point, I stated his conclusion in a neutral way.</page><page sequence="32">500 LEWIS ON DETAILED BALANCING adding a new variable, the number of photons . . . , we obtain a greatly enlarged science of thermodynamics"99 and one which by implication was consistent with photon conservation. The second objection arose out of spectroscopic considerations. Since an electron can undergo a transition from an upper to a lower energy level either directly or through various intermediate levels, it could be asked if the total number of photons emitted in both cases are equal. The answer was simple: the existence of "superfine structure" proved to Lewis that the upper and lower levels "must be multiple," and hence that both transi tions could result in the emission of the same number of photons, which again would preserve photon conservation. Consequently, "The rule that one, and only one, photon is lost in each elementary radiation process, is far more rigorous than any existing selection principle, and forbids the majority of processes which are now supposed to occur."100 Lewis suggested that these "inhibited" processes, if they existed, would be found particularly "at very low temperatures," and he indicated that he had already initiated experiments to test this prediction. This remark caught P. W. Bridgman's eye, and on 24 April 1927 he commented on it in a letter to Lewis: Your photons interest me very much, and I shall want to see how the new thermodynamics which you promise works out; and also of course whether you get any new experimental results at low temperatures. I can't help having a feeling, however, that the solution of our many present difficulties with the nature of light will be found at least partly in inventing new ways of thinking about things, particularly in thinking about time, rather than by inventing new quasi-material structures.101 Bridgmen was unaware that it was precisely because Lewis had begun to think anew about time that he had begun to think anew about microscopic reversibility and, ultimately, about the nature of light itself. Even before receiving Bridgman's letter, Lewis had returned to still another problem in radiation theory, the derivation of Planck's law, which was intimately related to the issue of photon conservation and the significance of photon conservation for the "extended thermodynamics" he hoped to develop. In ear ly April 1927, Lewis derived Planck's expression for the entropy of black body radiation102 (which of course was tantamount to deriving Planck's law) in a way that seemed to Lewis to be "even more fundamen "Lewis, "Conservation" (reference 93), p. 874. 100Ibid., p. 875. 101Bridgman to Lewis, 24 April 1927, Lewis Correspondence, Berkeley. 102Lewis, "Entropy" (reference 94), p. 307-313.</page><page sequence="33">ROGER H. STUEWER 501 tal" than Einstein's 1917 derivation?a remark which clearly indicated Lewis's continuing skepticism toward Einstein's concept of stimulated emission. Lewis did not regard his derivation as entirely satisfactory, how ever, because he had not explicitly used his law of photon conservation in it; he succeeded in a second approach to the problem103 less than two weeks later. Lewis considered an enclosure of volume v containing radiation of fre quency P, energy density uv, entropy density $v&gt; photon density nv - up/hp, and made the following three assumptions: first, that the total energy u - v /J? uvdP is constant or, in other words, that du/v - Sq SupdP = 0; second, that the radiation is in thermal equilibrium, its total entropy 5 = v/J? svdp a maximum or, in other words, that ds/v /0?? bspdp- J0?? (dsplbup)dupdP = 0; and third, that the total number of photons n = v /J? nvdv = v J0?? (uv/hv)dp is constant or, in other words, that dN/v' = J0?? (l/hp)bupdv = 0. Taken together, these three assumptions imply that ?=^+x2? (5&lt;1) ?up hp where Xi and X2 are constants independent of frequency but not in gen eral independent of temperature. They may be evaluated either by purely mathematical techniques or, Lewis argued, by starting from a considera tion of Wien's law, uv ~ P3 e~^v. Lewis chose to follow the second route. The proportionality constant in Wien's law had been "evaluated by Planck as Sirh/c3." This constant corresponded to "the particular kind of equilibrium" known as black body radiation, but, as Lewis contended later, if "the law of conservation of photons can be established" it would be "doubtful" that black body radiation "is as definite a thing as has been supposed."104 "In order to include all of our new types of equilibrium we may introduce a new quantity 7 which is constant only when the number of photons is constant. If 7 = 1 for the case of black body radiation, then in general 7 will give the ratio, at any frequency, between the actual energy density and the energy density in a black hollow at the same tempera ture."105 Lewis therefore multiplied Planck's proportionality constant by 103Lewis, "New Equation" (reference 91), pp. 471-476. Joan Bromberg has pointed out to me that in 1927 Dirac and Jordan were also willing to alter Planck's law by assuming that the number of photons is constant.

Nevertheless, if "it later proves possible to show that in absorption and emission of light the photon acts as an indes tructible and uncreatable atom, then we shall find, not only in the thermo dynamics of radiation, but also in the thermodynamics of all substances, great fields of equilibria hitherto unsuspected, in which the individual states differ from one another with respect to the new variable, the num ber of photons."107 Lewis's concluding words and entire derivation prove that by April 1927 he still had not taken Fowler's advice and familiarized himself with either Bose's derivation of Planck's law or Einstein's subsequent applications of Bose-Einstein statistics to gas theory.108 If he had, he could not have 106Ibid., p. 475. 107/6?U, pp. 475-476. 108See reference 37.</page><page sequence="35">ROGER H. STUEWER 503 missed seeing that his central assumption of photon conservation and the resulting introduction of his quantity 7 directly conflicted with a central assumption in Bose's derivation; namely, that the total number of photons is not constant. Lewis's "indestructible and uncreatable" photon was a chemist's atom and not a physicist's light quantum, a fatal flaw in Lewis's work. For although Lewis's term "photon" was promptly assimilated into physics, his "photon" concept was not. In October 1927, ten months after Lewis had introduced both his term and his concept, the fifth Solvay conference was held in Brussels. Throughout the almost three hundred printed pages of conference reports and discussions109 Lewis's term "photon" was frequently used?indeed, it appeared in the title chosen for the reports and discussions, Electrons et Photons?but his "photon" con cept was never elaborated. Thus, within a period of only ten months, the meaning of Lewis's term had changed radically: it no longer denoted Lewis's atom, but Einstein's light quantum. Perhaps the foremost advocate of this altered meaning at Brussels was Arthur H. Compton, who only two months later would travel to Stock holm to receive the 1927 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of the Compton effect.110 Understandably, Compton's advocacy of Lewis's term carried a great deal of authority. He adopted it at Brussels with the follow ing words: In referring to this unit of radiation I shall use the name "photon," sug gested recently by G. N. Lewis. This word avoids any implication re garding the nature of the unit, as contained for example in the name "needle ray." As compared with the terms "radiation quantum" and "light quant," this name has the advantages of brevity and of avoiding any implied dependence upon the much more general quantum me chanics or quantum theory of atomic structure.111 It is this meaning?Einstein's light quantum and not Lewis's atom?that the term "photon" has assumed ever since.

Brillouin pointed out that, according to de Broglie's most recent theory of light, the experiment that Lewis had proposed should actually yield a negative result.112 By the time of the fifth Solvay conference profound changes had taken place in physical theory. Both matrix mechanics and wave mechanics had been created, the Davisson-Germer and Thomson experiments had just established the existence of electron waves, and only one month earlier Bohr had first enunciated his principle of complementarity in Como.113 Lewis himself was fully aware of these developments, but his initial reac tion to them was mixed, as his contemporary correspondence with A. F. Joff? in Leningrad reveals.114 Lewis wrote Joff? that he felt that the dis covery of electron diffraction did not really help in understanding the dual nature of light. It only made the problem "a larger one," because now one had to explain why neither electrons nor photons can "pass to a cer tain forbidden spot in an interference field." Nevertheless, he told Joff?, he was becoming "a little more acquainted" with the "new mechanics," although the mathematics involved in it was "rather beyond the powers of an old-fashioned chemist."115 6. THE SYMMETRY OF TIME Lewis's conviction that time is symmetric was central to his research program for at least five years, 1925-1930. He expressed his confidence in the validity of the principle at the end of the period in the following words: "throughout the sciences of physics and chemistry, symmetrical or two-way time everywhere suffices. As a philosophic speculation this view has received some attention, but I shall be much disappointed if it can not llfy'Electrons et Photons (reference 109), pp. 139-140. 113For a full discussion, see appropriate sections in Max Jammer's Conceptual Development of Quantum Mechanics (reference 5).

That Lewis did in fact soon begin to familiarize himself with the "new mechanics" may be seen from his paper "The Quantum Laws and the Uncertainty Principle of Heisenberg," Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., 15 (1929), 127-139 (with Joseph E. Mayer).</page><page sequence="37">ROGER H. STUEWER 505 also be accepted as the statement of a law of physics, of exceptional scope and power, directly applicable to the solution of many classical and modern problems of physics."116 The conclusions Lewis drew from this principle were not always ac cepted by his contemporaries, but neither were they ever rejected as un worthy of consideration. In one instance, in the case of Lewis's direct particle interaction theory of light, two decades had to pass before Ein stein's criticisms were surmounted and Lewis's basic ideas vindicated: in 1945 Wheeler and Feynman dispensed with Lewis's assumption that the interaction takes place between a single emitter and absorber, and postu lated instead that sufficiently many particles are present to absorb com pletely the radiation emitted by the source.117 Wheeler and Feynman emphasized this point when they evaluated Lewis's contributions: "Lewis went nearly as far as it is possible to go without explicitly recognizing the importance of other absorbing matter in the system, a point touched upon by Tetrode, and shov/n . . . [by us] to be essential for the existence of the normal radiative mechanism."118 It is difficult to understand why Lewis so persistently rejected Einstein's concept of stimulated emission until one realizes the strength of his con viction that time is symmetric. As late as 1930, when Lewis published yet another derivation of Planck's law,119 this time one which was similar to 116Lewis, "Symmetry of Time" (reference 16), p. 570. 117John Archibald Wheeler and Richard Phillips Feynman, "Interaction with the Absorber as the Mechanism of Radiation," Reviews of Modern Physics, 17 (1945), 157-181; "Classical Electrodynamics in Terms of Direct Interparticle Action," Rev.

For comments on this paradox, see Mary B. Hesse, Forces and Fields (Totowa, New Jersey, 1965), pp. 279-285. Also see Carlton W.

The extent to which Lewis regarded the symmetry of time as a funda mental principle of nature became fully evident on 17 April 1930, when he received the gold medal of the Society of Arts and Sciences in New York City, and chose as the subject of his acceptance speech "The Sym metry of Time in Physics."121 In this long address, Lewis presented a panorama of physical phenomena?mechanical, thermodynamical, radia tive, electrodynamical?which he took to support the principle. "We shall see," he promised, "that nearly everywhere the physicist has purged from his science the use of one-way time, as though aware that this idea intro duces an anthropomorphic element, alien to the ideals of physics. Never theless, in several important cases unidirectional time and unidirectional causality have been invoked, but always, as we shall proceed to show, in support of some false doctrine."122 "To lighten the discussion," Lewis imagined an early protagonist of the symmetry of time, Dr. X, who kept notebooks in which he commented on relevant developments in physics as they occurred. Dr. X's first entry dealt with the progressive geometrization of kinematics which culminated in the work of Minkowski: "If this geometrical view of kinematics is correct q0 e mhv?kl _. qQ/(i - e hvjkl j = 2, while the average energy E contained in the ceils Qm is given by E = 0 + 1 kT(hv) + q0e~2hv,kl\2hv) + . .. = (1 - e~hv,k'1 )(hv){e-hvlkT + 2e-hvlkT + m_) = hvl{ehvlkT - l).Thus,ci? - (87rVhp3dv)l(c3)(ehvlkT - 1), which is Planck's law. It was no accident that Lewis's derivation was similar to de Broglie's of 1922, since Lewis acknowledged (p. 1536) that the "very simple method which I shall give here I owe in part to a kind communication from Professor L. Brillouin." For Louis de Broglie's deriva tion, see his "Rayonnement noir et quanta de lumi?re," Journal de Physique, 3 (1922), 422-428. Einstein wrote to Lewis (16 January 1931) that while he had not yet had the time to study it carefully, Lewis's derivation appeared to be very interesting (Lewis Correspon dence, Berkeley). 120Lewis, "Quantum Kinetics" (reference 119), p. 1533. 121 Lewis, "Symmetry of Time" (reference 16), pp. 569-577. l22lbid., p. 570.</page><page sequence="39">ROGER H. STUEWER 507 there must be no distinction of past and future."123 Similarly, in the me chanics of conservative systems, "no dissymmetry of time" is required: "All the equations of mechanics are equally valid when t is replaced by -f." Dr. X then became even bolder, speculating "that not only mechanics but all physics might eventually be reduced to a geometry." Thus he wrote in his notebooks: "If this belief be correct, Newton's idea of a flow of time has no place in physics. Until I see strong evidence to the contrary, I shall maintain this to be a basic law of physics .... Every equation and every explanation used in physics must be compatible with the symmetry of time. Thus we can no longer regard effect as subsequent to cause. If we think of the present as pushed into existence by the past, we must in precisely the same sense think of it as pulled into existence by the future."124 Dr. X regarded the second law of thermodynamics as "a source of un easiness," particularly Clausius' statement that the entropy of any system left to itself steadily increases to a maximum, but he took heart when he read in one of Gibbs's papers that "the impossibility of an uncompensated decrease of entropy seems to be reduced to an improbability," and he felt his suspicions fully vindicated when he read in Boltzmann's lectures on gas theory that "for the universe both directions of time are indistinguishable, as in space there is no up or down," Dr. X concluded: "The statistical interpretation of thermodynamics offered by Gibbs and Boltzmann af fords for the first time an understanding of entropy. The process irrevers ible in time does not exist."125 This "corollary of the law of symmetry in time" led to important conse quences. In the first place, matter had to be atomic in structure, since if two continuous media were allowed to diffuse into each other, "such a diffusion would in principle be a phenomenon which by no physical means could be reversed," whereas if they consisted of two streams of discrete particles, the reversal would only be a matter of time. The only problem, one of "much subtlety," arose if the particles were assumed to possess a whole continuum of possible initial positions and velocities, since then we could not claim that the streams would ever return precisely to their initial conditions. "It is a pity," Lewis interjected, "that Dr. X did not live to see the universal acceptance of quantum theory, which assigns to an isolated system ... a finite number of discrete states. Thus every particular state exactly recurs within finite time." This also meant to Lewis that Edding  l25Ibtd.t pp. 570-571.</page><page sequence="40">508 LEWIS ON DETAILED BALANCING ton's entropic arrow of time argument, which implied an eventual "running down" of the universe, had to be rejected.126 To truly understand what is meant by an irreversible process we should "dig up by the roots" and examine the concept very carefully. Consider the following typical but simple thermodynamical system: three different gas molecules in a cylinder divided in half by a shutter and maintained at a constant temperature. With the shutter open the probability for any given distribution to occur?say, all three molecules in the right half?is 1 in 23, or 1 in 8. This means that the increase in entropy that occurs when the system undergoes an irreversible change from a known distribution to an unknown distribution is feln23, or 3Mn2. "Whence we have now reached our most important conclusion. The increase in entropy comes when a known distribution goes over into an unknown distribution. The loss, which is characteristic of an irreversible process, is loss of information." "Gain in entropy always means loss of information, and nothing more .... Nothing further is needed to show that the irreversible process neither implies one-way time, nor has any other temporal implications. Time is not one of the variables of pure thermodynamics."127 Dr. X knew, of course, that the laws of optics were completely sym metrical concerning the emission and absorption of light. "The whole science of optics leaves nothing to be desired with respect to symmetry in time." One problem arose, however, when he considered the emission of a spherical wave from a point source. "The exact physical reversal of such a process is quite unthinkable. We should be obliged to imagine some pre arrangement whereby each of a number of bodies far and near would, at the appropriate time and in the right direction, send out its quota of energy, all of which in the neighborhood of the absorbing particle would coalesce into a continuous spherical shell."128 Problems of this character convinced Dr. X that "the only process of radiation which can be har monized with the symmetry of time is a process in which a single emitting particle at any one time sends its energy to only one receiving particle." This view had "some of the characteristics of Einstein's theory of the light quantum," and Lewis noted that "I think we may now agree that Dr. X was right_"129 Dr. X was "eminently satisfied" with the theory of electricity and mag netism. He saw that Maxwell's equations were symmetric with respect to 126Ibtd.f p. 571. This difference between Lewis and Eddington caught the eyes of F. O. Wollaston and K. W. Miller, who commented on it in their article "The Nature of Time " Atetare, 127(1931). 163. l21Ibid., p. 573. 12*Ibid. 129Ibid., p. 574.</page><page sequence="41">ROGER H. STUEWER 509 time. Yet, he was temporarily "bewildered" by the question of how to obtain the "old one-way theory of radiation" from such time-symmetric equations. "He did not see the full answer to this question until the devel opment of the theory of retarded potentials. Then he realized that in the mathematical treatment of the problem two symmetrical solutions arose, of which one was arbitrarily discarded because it seemed inconsistent with common notions of causality." Viewing the "whole history of physics," this was "the most remarkable example of the suppression by physicists of some of the consequences of their own equations, because they were not in accord with the old theory of unidirectional causality."130 The symmetry of time also had implications for chemistry; for example, for the chemistry of reaction rates. In the first place, the law of entire equilibrium, which Lewis had deduced from this principle, implied that Pa$ab = Pb^ba* where pa andpfr are the probabilities of finding the system in states a and b, and (f)ab and ?ba are tne "intrinsic probabilities" for the system to go from a ? b and from b ? a in a given time. But 4&gt;ay and (pya must be symmetrical functions of the same intrinsic properties, and hence one also had, in Lewis's nomenclature, the "law of the mutuality of elementary processes," (pab = (j)ya. Together, these two laws implied a third, the law of equality of a priori probabilities, pa - pb&gt; These three laws were "the fundamental laws of quantum kinetics and quantum statis tics. They are at present the most important [new] deductions from the law of the symmetry of time."131 Lewis felt, in sum, that extremely important lessons should be learned from his examination of Dr. X's recently discovered notebooks: We have seen that if science long ago had accepted the principle of sym metry in time, it would have eliminated the idea of unidirectional causal ity which has led to so many of the errors of classical physics. From this principle could have been deduced the atomic structure of matter and the newer [statistical] thermodynamics. By its aid the flaws in the older theories of radiation and in the electromagnetic theory would have been seen. Moreover, the idea that light passes only from one particle to one 130Ibid. To analyze this problem geometrically in a way that gives equal weight to the retarded and advanced potentials, Lewis and Wilson had invented the geometrical vector field. See Gilbert N. Lewis and Edwin B. Wilson, "The Space-Time Manifold of Relativity: The Non-Euclidean Geometry of Mechanics and Electromagnetics," Proc. Amer. Acad. Arts and Set., 48 (1912), 389-507. Lewis also argued that unless the emerging quantum electrodynamics did not take account of the retarded and advanced potentials simultaneously and symmetrically, it would not "fully succeed."

CONCLUSIONS The symmetry of time was therefore a very general, unifying, and heuristic principle of nature to Lewis. On the one hand, once convinced of its validity he used it as the basic hypothesis for his theories and ideas, and it became the source of his confidence in them. On the other hand, he found that it stimulated new avenues of research. Both functions of Lewis's principle are apparent in the enunciation and elaboration of his law of entire equilibrium, and in the evolution of his ideas on the nature of radiation. Lewis's deep-rooted conviction that time is symmetric also had negative aspects. It caused him to reject and, later, to mistrust Einstein's concept of stimulated emission. Lewis never saw the full significance of Van Vleck's and Bose's papers for his own theories. Contemporary physicists, therefore, attached less importance to Lewis's ideas than they might have. Basically, they in turn accepted some, but rejected others. Tolman, Fow ler, and Einstein accepted the potential fruitfulness of Lewis's law of en tire equilibrium, but rejected his conclusions concerning Einstein's concept of stimulated emission. Bohr and Richardson studied Lewis's theory of direct particle interaction, but were deterred by its difficulties. Einstein examined Lewis's ideas on radiation and microscopic reversibility, but immediately saw their shortcomings. Compton and everyone else accepted Lewis's term "photon," but rejected his photon concept. Finally, most of Lewis's contemporaries, apart from Bridgman and perhaps one or two others, did not share his enthusiasm for the principle of symmetry of time. For the most part they regarded it as a "philosophic speculation" and did not accept it as a "law of physics, of exceptional scope and power." if none of Lewis's contemporaries took his principle as lightly as the New York Times reporter who characterized it as "Two-Timing,"133 or if none regarded it as fundamantal as Lewis did, he himself contributed to the situation through his continued adverse attitude toward Einstein's con cept of stimulated emission. Most contemporary physicists and chemists 132Ibid., p. 575. 133Lachman, Borderland (reference 10), p. 117.</page><page sequence="43">ROGER H. STUEWER 511 sided with Einstein on this issue. In general, however, Lewis's principle was not so much rejected as simply ignored. There was no concerted or pro tracted contemporary public debate on the validity of symmetry of time. No one seems to have directly built upon or developed Lewis's ideas.134 This may have been disappointing to Lewis, but it was certainly not totally unexpected. He took great pleasure in the role of scientific provo cateur he chose for himself. Throughout his life, he had a strong desire to strike out in new directions and to stimulate the thought of other physi cists and chemists. This trait was not only apparent in his research, but in his teaching as well. His seminars at Berkeley were marked by their open ness and air of excitement.135 Lewis's willingness to attack leading prob lems in physics and chemistry, so evident in the work I have examined here, was one of the salient characteristics of his scientific personality.
