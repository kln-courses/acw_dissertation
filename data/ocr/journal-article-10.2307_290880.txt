In an earlier study I have argued against the view that the Olympian scenes in Homer are "late" expressions of Ionian skepticism, and in favor of the explanation that they are mainly ancient myth or folk tale, retold with touches of genial humor for the delectation of the listener.' This brings up the larger question whether in general the roles and characters of the gods were invented by the poet or taken from a common stock of myth and popular tradition, and here we find uncertainty as well as diversity of opinion. The historian of religion or mythology commonly regards the poems as expressions of existing tradition and belief and finds it convenient to treat them as a unity in which is reflected a fairly coherent stage of religious develop- ment; occasionally, however, he feels obliged to exorcise the spirit of the higher criticism by such apotropaic formulas as " in a passage of doubtful authenticity," "perhaps interpolated," "probably of late composition," and the like.2 The Homeric 1"The Higher Criticism on Olympus," A.J.P., LVIII (1937), pp. 257-274; see also "Homer's Gods: Prolegomena," T.A.P.A., LXVIII (1937), pp. 11-25, especially pp. 16 f. 2 Cf. H. J. Rose, A Handbook of Greek Mythology (New York, 1929). Walter F. Otto (Die G6tter Griechenlands [Bonn, 1929], p. 15) re- marks that differences in time between the Iliad and the Odyssey, or between parts of the poems, may be disregarded, "denn in allem Wesentlichen ist die religiose Anschauung iiberall dieselbe."

CALHOUN. critic on the other hand usually takes a point of view which is a by-product of his theories; if he is looking for criteria which may be used to distinguish Schichten, he is naturally tempted to ascribe differences in the portrayal of the gods to the inven- tion of the different poets whose handiwork he is trying to identify.3 Thus Homer is for Finsler a pessimistic philosopher who invented the Olympian scenes of the Iliad to express his Weltanschauung; 4 for Wilamowitz he is the creator of the Olympian fairyland of graceful phantasy revealed in the Apate.5 So potent is the domination of Homeric study by ideas of this sort that Nilsson cannot get wholly free of them even in his brilliant demonstration that much of Greek mythology goes back to Mycenaean origins.6 The belief that the Homeric gods and the Olympian scenes are original creations is not, however, restricted to the separatists; Drerup, for example, regards the divine apparatus as the poet's own invention, intended to em- phasize by contrast the reality of the human characters and actions.7 Both points of view may be traced far back in the history of Homeric criticism, and both of course have elements of truth. Common sense tells us that Homer, like other poets, used what he found and also invented for himself.8 Yet even after we terms of the need to distinguish between earlier and later parts of the poems. Erik Heden (Homerische Gotterstudien [Upsala, 1912], p. 3) assumes that the Odyssey represents a later stage than the Iliad. A. Roussel (La religion dans Homire [Paris, 1914], introduction) starts from the assumption of Homeric unity. See also M. P. Nilsson, A History of Greek Religion (Oxford, 1925), p. 135. 3 Cf. M. P.

We cannot say definitely of any passage or episode, of any motif or characterization, or even any slight detail, whether it is newly invented or drawn from a common stock. Very often this question is of first im- portance to an understanding of the poet's art, or his religious ideas, or the intellectual and moral background of his times. We do not fully understand the poems if we cannot say whether the tale of Ares and Aphrodite is a late invention interpolated to satirize the popular religion, or is the unconscious expression of a mildly licentious contemporary taste in poetry, or comes from an ancient stock of primitive, naive, amusing tales about the gods. In the same way it is important to know whether the Apate is a sacrilegious burlesque upon the holy mystery of the iepos yacos, or a licentious nouvelle galante, or the adaptation to the poet's purpose of an ancient folk tale long told about gods or humans. If such questions as these are to be answered, we must find more valid criteria than our preconceptions or a priori assump- tions. We need to know what tales about the gods were current while the poems were being composed. In the complete absence of contemporary external evidence it might seem that the inquiry must inevitably move in a vicious circle. There is, however, a way to avoid the fallacy. Scattered through both poems are brief references or allusions to tales of gods and heroes, or to events and characters in these tales, briefly introduced in anal- ogies, illustrations, similes, or reminiscences, or in descriptions of places or accounts of famous persons and families. For the most part these references are purely incidental, and so phrased that they would be meaningless and impossible were the audience not already well acquainted with the tales.9 There are also stories told at greater length, but, like the briefer references, brought in incidentally and not direct, organic parts of the narrative. Here the case is not so certain; there is always the possibility the dividing line? What is to be ascribed to tradition taken over by a poet, and what to his own imagination? " See also P. Cauer, Grund- fragen der Homerkritik (Leipzig, 1923), p. 381. 9 For example, A 267 f. would be meaningless to hearers who did not know of the Lapiths and Centaurs, or r 6 to those who were not familiar with stories about Pygmies. 3</page><page sequence="4">GEORGE M. CALHOUN. that the poet has invented a story for its ornamental value or for the sheer joy of telling it. Yet there is a distinct probability that such incidental, inorganic stories were taken from material already in existence, and in several instances this probability is reinforced by the manner of the telling.10 Furthermore, when we encounter folk motifs known from the MIarchen of every land and time, magic potions, for example, or wondrous steeds, or enchanters' wands, we can be sure that they are not new inventions but part of the poet's stock in trade. Finally, if we view all of this material together and perceive that many of the personages, motifs, and episodes bear a marked resemblance to those of folk tale or popular legend, the collection as a whole may reasonably be taken to represent a common stock of myth and popular tale which was familiar to Homeric audiences. The passages to which I invite attention are for the most part casual references, or brief summaries, or incidental tales, and relate to stories in which gods or mythical and legendary personages have an important part. In the Iliad, events which are part of the action before Troy are organic and hence are excluded by definition.11 In the Odyssey, the adventures of Odysseus in fairyland and the encounter of Menelaus with Pro- teus are included because they are generally admitted to draw directly upon popular tale for motifs and incidents. In both poems, a number of typical folk motifs and also characteristic or habitual actions of gods or other supernatural beings are included although the contexts in which they occur are organic.12 I have tried to indicate as briefly as possible the nature and extent of the material which seems to me pertinent; doubts and differences of opinion are discussed in footnotes or in connection with my general conclusions.l3 10 E. g., the tale of Bellerophon, Z 155-205; cf. infra note 16. 11 For convenience the line is drawn arbitrarily at the gathering of the host in Aulis. 12 When it is said that Thetis is in the palace of Nereus (A 357 f.) or that the gods are visiting the Ethiopians (A 423 f.), the statements are in a way part of the action, but they imply a background of story well known to the audience. When Poseidon or Athena uses a magic wand (N 59 f.; v 429; ir 172, 456), a folk motif is introduced into the action of the poems. 13 In order to keep the apparatus within limits, the passages with which my discussion and conclusions have to do are given here in the 4</page><page sequence="5">HOMER'S GODS-MYTH AND MARCHEN.

A 20-67 wrath of Hera and Athena and Hera's mustering of the host, which seem to imply the judgment of Paris;15 219 order of their occurrence, and citations which can easily be got from this register are as a rule not repeated. The collection may perhaps be found useful because handbooks of mythology do not ordinarily segre- gate the Homeric material, and Homeric handbooks usually pay scant attention to mythology or folk tale; cf. T. D. Seymour, Life in the Homeric Age (New York, 1907), p. 2, where the subject is dismissed in a sentence, despite its undoubted importance for an understanding of Homeric life in any but the narrowest sense. It should be made clear that this inquiry is not concerned with theories of composition based upon mythological material (collected and discussed by Drerup, Homer- problem, Chap. VI), or with attempts to determine the relative an- tiquity of this mythical material (cf. Heden, Gotterstudien, pp. 31 ff.), but only with the extent and general character of the tales which clearly were known to Homeric audiences. The difficult problems involved in the relations between this material and mythological scenes in early Hellenic or pre-Hellenic art do not come within the scope of this study, which I have attempted to keep as much as possible to the Homeric text. 14 Unless the story was invented to explain the text, the legend of the abduction of Helen by Theseus is implied; Aethra here has been an annoyance to commentators since Aristarchus, who athetized the line, but here she is, in the MSS. Though Nilsson regards r as one of the later books, he takes this passage as evidence that the legend was of respectable antiquity (Mycenaean Origin of Greek Mythology, pp. 167 f.). 16 Cf. infra n. 23. 6</page><page sequence="6">GEORGE M.

That the story is taken from familiar tradition is indicated not only by this abundance of folk material but also by the brevity with which the episodes are treated (e.g., the slaying of the Chimaera, 183: Karerreerve Oecwv repdearrt 6rtaoas) and by the terse reference to Bellero- phon's last unhappy wanderings (200-202). The attempts to prove that these three lines are an interpolation (see Leaf, ad loc.) seem to me utterly futile; like many similar feats of analysis, they start from an arbitrary refusal to understand words in their simple, natural sense, for Kal Kelvos clearly means, to any but higher critics, "even Bellero- phon." 17 Here again (cf. supra n. 14) we cannot be certain whether the text contains an allusion to the story of the wall built by Poseidon and Apollo with the help of a mortal, Aeacus (cf. Pind., 01., viii, 30 ff.), or the story was suggested by the text. Line 438 is certainly easier to understand on the former supposition. 8 The higher criticism tends to the view that this passage is an awkward imitation of X 208-213, where we have the original invention (e. g., Wilamowitz, Die Ilias und Homer, p. 43; Finsler, Homer I, part 2 [1924], pp. 203, 206).

Rel., XXXIII [1935], pp. 90 f.), there can be little doubt that the scales of fate and their association with Zeus was an ancient motif, familiar to the poet and to his audience, and there is no valid ground for regarding one of the passages as an imitation of the other. No one who has given real thought to the epic use of formula will fail to allow for the possibility that we have here an ornamental formula, appropriate to crucial mo- ments in combat, which admitted in the third and following lines a wide choice of names or of noun-epithet formulas in the genitive such as are listed by M. Parry, L'epithete traditionelle dans HomBre (Paris, 1928), pp. 69-78. There is really no good ground for suspecting even 0 73 f.; the illogical, but psychologically understandable, 4eae^qv is more apt to be early than late. The later feeling is shown in the curious ancient variant e`eaOev reported in the scholia. 9 Much of the material suggests familiar folk motifs; e.g., the offense of Oeneus, the monstrous boar, the quarrel over the spoils, the strife of Idas with Apollo for Marpessa, the curse of Althaea. The tale is evidently well known, as Phoenix says (524: ovrw KatC rvp 'rpoafev eirevo6eOaa KX\a dvsp6v), and the general belief that the poet is here using familiar material is undoubtedly correct. 7</page><page sequence="8">GEORGE M.

That Aristophanes and Aristarchus athetized them is interesting only for the light it throws on Alexandrian criticism; cf. my " Nausicaa et Aristarque," Rev. Bt. Hon., IV (1934), pp. 11 f. To stigmatize the legends, apart from the birth of Heracles, as "not Homeric" is, as I point out later, to reject everything that is mentioned once only in the poems (cf. infra n. 23). What really underlies the attempt to excise the passage, apart from the encouragement derived from Aristarchus, is the fallacious notion of "late" Ionian irreverence (cf. supra n. 1). 8</page><page sequence="9">HOMER'S GODS-MYTH AND MARCHEN.

Yet the situation in its essential outline is the familiar one of the wish that turns out wrong; Achilles has got his wish, but it has led to the death of his beloved comrade and the loss of his arms.

If we adopt this principle, we shall have to strike out all the references I have listed on page 16, and may well ask how many times a story must be referred to before it can be regarded as Homeric. I know of no better explana- tion of Helen's words to Aphrodite in r 400-409, or Hera's to Zeus in A 26-28, than that the poet is thinking of the judgment of Paris, sub- stantially as we know it from later sources; the frenzy of Hera, sweat- ing up and down throughout the land to muster the Achaeans, suits better with Q 29 f. than with the idea that she is on the side of the Achaeans merely because she is the patron goddess of Argos (Wila- mowitz, Ilias und Homer, pp. 287 f.). Rose might better have dis- missed the reference as interpolation than offered to the shades of Aristarchus the remarkable interpretation he proposes (Handbook, p. 107). See also J. A.

This collection, while not exhaustive, is reasonably complete, I believe, in the matter of old legends; it could be considerably expanded were all folk motifs to be noted in detail. Selection is necessarily subjective, and each critic must depend upon his own examination of the text and his own choice of material. There will of course be differences of opinion, both in selection and in interpretation, but I believe that any who will read the poems with particular attention to material of the general types col- lected will be convinced that a great fund of myth and legend was known to the poet and also to his audiences and that much of this bears the authentic stamp of the primitive popular tale.34 3aThe meaning of KaXXeL ... dAuppooic has been much discussed; it may be taken as "immortal beauty," but Xplerac suggests a beauty produced by anointing with ambrosia, as in X 170, where certainly we have this motif. 33 The Harpies, who are stormwinds (cf. Rose, op. cit., p. 28), are identical with the 0veXXat of line 66, but rather more sharply personi- fied here than elsewhere in the Odyssey (a 241; t 371). In II 150 the personification is complete, though complicated by the equine concep- tion of Podarge. Helen's wish in Z 345-348, couched in almost the words of Penelope, suggests that she has in mind some such tale as is told here of the daughters of Pandareus, or perhaps a story of children snatched away at birth. 34 "Eine genaue Untersuchung der Motive lasst vielmehr die Ver- 14</page><page sequence="15">HOMER'S GODS-MYTH AND MARCHEN. Both poet and hearers know of many strange mythical races, Pygmies and Giants, Cimmerians and Ethiopians, Laestrygo- nians and Lotuseaters, Phaeacians, Amazons, Centaurs, and Cyclopes.35 The two last are close kin to other monstrous beings that lurk in the remoter parts of earth or belong to the distant, legendary past, Sirens, sea monsters, Scylla, Harpies, Gorgon, the Chimaera, the hellhound Cerberus, Briareus, Typhoeus, and the monster slain by Heracles at Troy. The familiar conceptions of fairyland are found in the refer- ences to the Ethiopians and Lotuseaters, the enchanted isles of Circe and Calypso, the floating island of Aeolus, Scheria, the Elysian Fields, and Olympus. There are also marvelous palaces and gardens, like the abodes of Alcinous and Circe, the grotto of Calypso, the brazen castle of Aeolus, the palaces of Poseidon and of Nereus in the depths of the sea, and the dwellings of Zeus and the other Olympians, bright with the gleam of gold and filled with beautiful, sometimes magical, objects wrought by Hephaestus. At the other pole we have the dark and misty realm of Hades and Persephone, the meadow of asphodel, and finally nethermost Tartarus with gates of iron and brazen threshold. Somewhere between are the dark and cheerless lands of the Cimmerians and the country of Dreams.36 The limitless stock of popular myth and legend known to the poet, and equally well to his audiences, can scarcely be con- ceived by the reader who has not given particular attention to the nature of these passing references. Some of them make really an overwhelming impression of broad realms of fantastic story into which the poet allows us the merest glimpse as we mutung begriindet erscheinen, dass hinter dem Epos eine reich bliihende und vielseitig gegliederte Erzihlungsliteratur gestanden haben muss, neben Sage und Marchen auch heilige Legende und Novelle bereits entwickelt waren" (Radermacher, op. cit., p. 3). 36 The ogre motif is dominant in the episode of Polyphemus and dis- tinct in the account of the Laestrygonians (K 112-116, 120, 124). In a 85-87 Echetus resembles certain figures in the legends of Theseus. 86 In these elfin lands we find the curious intermingling of fact with fancy that is so common in Mirchen; for example, hints of polar nights and days (X 14-19; K 82-86), the land whose folk eat no salt and have never seen an oar (X 121-128; t 268-275), and the uncertainty about the Phaeacian ships, which now are rowed by amazingly good oarsmen and now seem to go of themselves (0 555-563).</page><page sequence="16">GEORGE M. CALHOUN. follow the thread of the action in the Iliad or the Odyssey.37 There is for instance B 814, the hill near Troy which the im- mortals call "the tomb of agile Myrina"; E 766, with its tantalizing suggestion of other encounters in which Ares had been worsted by Athena; 38 Z 200-202, implying an unhappy last chapter in the life of Bellerophon; ? 362-365, suggestive of lost episodes in the tale of Heracles; X 323 f., the visit of Rhada- manthys to Tityus; 0 226-228, the death of Eurytus; o 250 f., the love of Eos for Clitus; p 207, hints of old tales of the spring in Ithaca and kings of olden time; ao 85-87, which suggests there were stories about Echetus, apparently a sort of local ogre. Other allusions are less striking because the tales at which the poet hints are familiar to us in the forms they took in later literature, yet they are equally valuable as evidence of a common stock of myth and folk tale on which the poet could count to make his allusions intelligible to any audience. For example, he refers once only to the Pygmies (r 6), to Daedalus (E 592), to the elfin steed Arion (I 346), to Niobe (0 602-617), to Jasion, the ill-fated lover of Demeter (e 125), to the translation of Ino (E 333-335), to Itylus (r 522), to the fate of Pandareus' daugh- ters (v 66-78). Yet each of these references, even though it be limited to a word or two, implies a well known tale or group of tales. Where there are repeated references to a single story, each is likely to be of this same sort, that is, a mere hint or casual men- tion which evidently served to recall the entire story to the hearer's mind. For example, the immortal steeds of Achilles are first mentioned at the end of the Catalogue (B 770), merely 87 What has been gleaned from later sources in regard to these mythical figures will be found in Roscher's Lexicon and in Pauly- Wissowa, R.-E., as far as that work has progressed. We have always to consider the possibility, in some cases the certainty, that later writers are inventing stories to explain allusions they no longer under- stand; thus, in the case of Myrina, we cannot say what, if any, of the marvelous tales found in Diod. Sic., iii, 54 if., where Dionysius of My- tilene (2d cent. B. C.) is quoted, were known in Homeric times; in Strabo, xii, 8, 6, p. 573, the identification with the Amazons seems to be merely an inference from the epithet. 88 Perhaps in connection with the exploits of Heracles; cf. 0 362-365; [Hes.], Shield, 325-344, 443-456; Roscher, Lex., I, 479 f. and, on the association of Heracles with Athena in early art, I, 2215 f. 16</page><page sequence="17">HOMER'S GODS-MYTH AND MARCHEN. as the finest horses in the Achaean host; as such they are prom- ised by Hector to Dolon (K 322 f., 330 f.). The first allusion to their supernatural character is the remark of Odysseus to Dolon, later repeated by Apollo to Hector, that they are hard for mor- tals to manage, save for Achilles, a goddess' son (K 402-404 P 76-78). We learn their names and pedigree at II 148, where their part in the action begins; their sire was Zephyrus and their dam the harpy Podarge, pasturing in a meadow by the stream of Ocean. When they leap the trench (II 380 f.), and when they bear Automedon to safety (II 866 f.), we are told that they were a gift of the gods to Peleus. At P 426 they refuse to leave the battlefield, and stand mourning for the fallen Patroclus until Zeus, filled with pity, breathes into them goodly might, crying "Why did we give you to Peleus, a mortal, and ye ageless and immortal ? " The famous passage in which Xanthus is miracu- lously endowed with speech and foretells his master's death (T 392-424) contains no allusion to the story of the horses except the words " famed offspring of Podarge." From I 277 f. we learn that Poseidon gave them to Peleus, and it seems likely, in the light of the poet's references to the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, to the spear and the arms of Peleus, that they also were a wedding gift. These elfin steeds call to mind other instances of this familiar motif, the mares tended by Apollo for Admetus (B 763-767), the horses given by Zeus as atonement for the rape of Ganymede and the foals bred from them by a trick of Anchises (E 265-273; cf. 640, 651), the wondrous steeds of Erichthonius sired by Boreas (Y 223-229), Arion (4 346 f.), and the comments of the chieftains on the horses of Rhesus (K 546, 551, 556 f.) ; a related motif is the marvelous horseman- ship of the twins Actorion, sons of Poseidon (4 638-642). With immortal steeds may be compared the cattle and sheep of Helius, which are not born and die not (K 127-131), Orion's dog (X 29), and perhaps the horned lambs of Libya (8 85), which verge on the supernatural. Not only is the poet's memory well stored with the Gemeingut of popular legend, but he is thoroughly acquainted with the principle cycles relating to the earlier generation of heroes and consistently assumes an acquaintance as thorough on the part of his hearers. His references to the exploits of Heracles, to the legends of Thebes, and to the Argonauts imply the general 2 17</page><page sequence="18">GEORGE M. CALHOUN. outlines of accounts found in later literature, though there are of course divergences in details.39 As regards the earlier epi- sodes in the tale of Troy, he is familiar with the wedding of Peleus and Thetis and with the judgment of Paris, and has ap- parently an inexhaustible fund of story about the royal house of Troy.40 In addition to the famous list of Zeus' loves and the catalogue of heroines in the Necyia, allusions to the amours of gods, nymphs, and mortals are scattered through the poems. It is clear that this was a favorite type of story and that many of these legends had spread beyond the localities of origin and become part of the common stock of song, familiar to poets and to audiences everywhere. The abundance of this material cannot be doubted, and we have seen how many of the motifs bear the stamp of folk and fairy tale.41 Besides fabulous races and monsters, strange lands and palaces, immortal steeds and cattle, unions of human beings with gods and nymphs, we may note, without any attempt at clas- sification or completeness, that the passages to which I have in- vited attention contain references or allusions to magic wands, talismans, enchanted ships and marvelous devices, superhuman strength, metamorphosis, invisibility, prodigious strides and shouts, rivalry with gods, magic potions and unguents, the gift of immortality or of eternal youth, servitude of supernatural beings, gifts of gods to mortals, misuse of magic gifts, broken compacts with gods, scales of fate, stock tricks and stratagems of folk tale, one against many, tokens of death, Potiphar's wife, the king's daughter and half of the kingdom, trial of skill for a "8 The more important references are, for Heracles, B 659 f.; E 392- 397, 640-651; 0 362-369; A 690-693; Z 250-256; O 25-30, 639 f.; T 98- 124; T 145-148; 0 223 f.; X 266-270, 601-626; 0 25-30; for Thebes, A 376-398; E 802-808; Z 222 f.; K 285-290; I 679 f.; X 271-280, 326 f.; o 244-247; for Jason and the Argo, H 468 f.; 1 41; 4 747; cA 69-72. 40 On the judgment of Paris, cf. supra n. 23. 41 For an excellent brief analysis of typical "folk-tale motifs," see Nilsson, History of Greek Religion, pp. 49-60.

Its relation to what is explicitly said in the poems is very much that of the complex background of fiction and of history against which the modern novel is composed. Although the action in both poems tends to be upon the human plane, with only admixture of the fabulous or super- natural,43 a sharp line cannot be drawn between the rational and the fantastic-after all the poet is telling a tale of the heroes of olden time. The material in which we are interested is found mainly in the allusions to old tales or in the fairylands of the Odyssey, but it is continually spilling over into the proper action of the poems. The plot of the Odyssey and several major epi- sodes come from Marchen,44 and we are likely to meet a fan- tastic motif anywhere in either poem. Circe wields a magic 42 See the exhaustive collection of triads in J. W. S.

Bethe, Homer I, Ilias (Leipzig, 1914), p. 32. The discussion by W. J. Woodhouse, The Composition of Homer's Odyssey (Oxford, 1930), though rather subjective and arbitrary, offers an interesting analysis. In recognizing the abundance of folk material in the Odyssey, where it stares the reader in the face, critics have usually failed to understand how much of the same material is implied in the scattered allusions and references of the Iliad. 19</page><page sequence="20">GEORGE M. CALHOUN. wand in Aeaea, where Eos dwells and has her dancing places, but Athena does the same in Ithaca or Poseidon on the battle- field of Troy, and Hermes is seldom without his potent staff. The steeds of Achilles belong to the legend of Peleus and Thetis but we see them on the battlefield, and the horses captured from Aeneas by Diomede were sired by the immortal stallions that Zeus gave to Tros. Diomede wounds Ares as he might any human opponent, yet the god cries out with the voice of ten thousand men and rises into the heavens like a vast, dark cloud. Everywhere the natural and the supernatural are mingled inex- tricably. We have now to examine more particularly the traces of old tales about the gods, and the possibility that these old tales de- termine the conceptions of the gods presented in the Olympian scenes. In the account of Poseidon's union with Tyro (A 235- 259), which represents as we have seen a very common motif, the god lay with the woman where the river Enipeus met the sea, and round about them was set a dark wave, mountain high, which arched over and hid the god and the mortal woman. This watery grotto created by the god for his embraces, miraculously wrought in the fluid element, is precisely the counterpart of the bed of flowers and the golden cloud in the Apate (E 346-351); in both we have clearly the same motif, probably taken from old popular tales of divine amours, and there seems to be no valid reason for regarding the latter passage as a burlesque upon the holy, mystic marriage of Hera and Zeus.45 Again, the central 64 The appearance of the Lepbs 'ydlos in cult is in no way incompatible with the interpretation here proposed, for traditions of cult and of popular tale relating to the same characters or episodes may coexist and may be connected by mutual borrowings. What is important is the lack of valid grounds for the assumption that the union of Hera and Zeus was narrated only in religious poems, in which it was treated with reverence, until the poet of the Apate seized upon it as a theme for a sacrilegious burlesque, and the consequent conclusion that the Homeric treatment is incompatible with a reverent attitude toward the gods. If popular tales of divine amours were as abundant in the Homeric age as the allusions in the poems suggest, it is scarcely con- ceivable that they ignored the union of Hera and Zeus, and in X 295 f. we find an allusion to a story of their first stolen embraces which strongly suggests the popular tale. Finsler's theory (Die olympischen Szenen, pp. 18 ff.) that E 347-351 are actually taken from an old 20</page><page sequence="21">HOMER'S GODS-MYTH AND MARCHEN. theme of the Apate is explicitly recited in the poet's references to the story of Heracles (S 249-261; cf. O 16-33), and when we consider its elemental simplicity, a woman tricking a man by the oldest and most universal of feminine arts, we see clearly that the general atmosphere of the episode and the characteriza- tions of the divine participants derive from ancient popular tradition. In the Apate Zeus does not actually maul Hera, but frightens her by threatening to do so and by reminding her of what had happened when she used the trick before in her persecution of Heracles. At that time he had hung her up by the hands with anvils fastened to her feet, and in his rage had flung from Olympus the gods who would have rescued her; her confederate Hypnus would have been flung into the sea had he not been saved by Nyx, whom Zeus scrupled to offend. It was perhaps on this occasion, or at any rate on a similar one, that Hephaestus, attempting to defend Hera from her enraged consort, was seized by the foot and hurled from the battlements of heaven (A 590- 594). Zeus does not actually use violence toward any of the gods in the Olympian scenes, but he is always threatening to do so and is expected by the other gods to make good his threats at any moment. This incessant quarreling between Zeus and Hera, which runs through all the Olympian scenes of the Iliad, seems to have had an equally large part in the old tales of Heracles so often alluded to in the poem. In the story of Heracles' birth (T 95-133), Hera tricks Zeus by a device which has a strong flavor of Marchen, and Zeus satisfies his rage by flinging Ate from Olym- pus. The story of Hephaestus thrown from Olympus by the will of Hera because of his deformity and given asylum by the sea maidens Thetis and Eurynome, for whom he wrought secretly in their grotto much marvelous jewelry, bears all the earmarks of the popular tale (Y 395-405). sacred poem of cult breaks down when the episode is studied in its entirety; the lines are at one with the extravagant description of Hera's boudoir and her toilet (S 166-186), all of which suggests folk material intended to create the atmosphere of unearthly magnificence appropriate for divine embraces. Whatever may be the date of the Hymn to Aphro- dite, the treatment of this identical motif in 58-74 seems to rest on the same immemorial tradition of popular tale. 21</page><page sequence="22">GEORGE M. CALHOUN. In fact the dominant motif of the Olympian scenes through- out both poems is the quarreling, the division and conflict, among the gods, which closely parallels the strife and conflict between the human characters. During the course of the Menis, it is the quarrel of Hera with Zeus, which we are never allowed to forget; the poet cannot repeat continually such tense episodes as the close of the Apate, the open breach in A, or the fruitless sortie of the goddesses in ?, but the motif is felt in all the scenes in which Zeus nags maliciously at Hera or reproaches her for her bitterness toward the Trojans. In the brief scene S 356- 367, to which one Zenodorus,46 otherwise unknown, owes his little measure of immortality, we have perhaps the transition to the form in which the motif appears after the reconciliation of Achilles and Agamemnon; from this point on it is not so much the anger of Hera against Zeus as strife between the gods who favor Troy and those who are friendly to the Achaeans, begin- ning with the Theomachy and ending with the quarrel over Achilles' treatment of Hector's body. In the Odyssey the Olym- pian scenes are fewer and generally shorter, perhaps because the theme of the poem makes it less appropriate to parallel the hu- man action by divine. Yet in three of the scenes the motif is the anger of Poseidon and the conflict between his wishes and Athena's, and in a fourth the wrath of Helius is appeased only by prompt compliance with his ultimatum;47 in the final scene, 46 Wilamowitz (Die Ilias und Homer, p. 170) speaks appreciatively of the ancient critic, but points out that he should have gone a bit farther and expunged also 168, 181-186; in justice to Zenodorus, how- ever, it must be remembered that he may have done so earlier in his commentary and should at least be given the benefit of the doubt. If we may judge by what is said in the scholia, the ten books of Zenodorus, had they been preserved, would have reduced much of the modern higher criticism to the status of mere repetition. The lines in question are an integral part of the tradition, and I have yet to hear any objective reason for rejecting them; the arguments of the higher critics, who are of course practically unanimous in condemnation (cf. "Nausicaa et Aristarque," Rev. Et. Horn., IV [1934], p. 11, n. 2), are not impres- sive to one who is really familiar with the Olympian scenes. 47 This passage again (cf. supra n. 46) is rejected by most critics and seems to have been condemned by Aristarchus (cf. sch. to r 277). The most tangible objection to its authenticity, that it is a heterogeneous element in the tale of wanderings, is most cogently presented by Ove 22</page><page sequence="23">HOMER'S GODS-MYTH AND MLIRHEN. between Zeus and Athena, we have, as Zeus observes, only the completion of the plan proposed by Athena in the earlier scenes. It is no exaggeration to say that in both poems the Olympian episodes are constructed almost wholly around this single, domi- nant motif, and if the quarrels, conflicts, and threats of the gods against one another should be taken out, nothing would remain. We have seen that the motif is at least as old as the tales of HIeracles so often referred to in the poems. There are indica- tions that it was as old as the earliest legends about the gods, for we have the unpleasantness engendered by the amours of Eos and Demeter with mortal men, the legend of Typhoeus, the conflicts of Zeus with Cronus and the Titans and with the giants, Otus and Ephialtes. Against this background, Thetis' story of the revolt against Zeus and Hera's reference to marital quarrels of Oceanus and Tethys, which taken by themselves might seem to be the poet's own invention, appear to be remi- niscences of ancient legends. The story of Ares and Aphrodite differs from other Olympian scenes in being incidental to the action. Both the general theme and the detail-deceived husband, spying friend, magic snare, discomfiture of the guilty pair-mark it as one of the most ancient and universal of popular tales, in which, depending on Jorgensen, "Das Auftreten der Gotter in den Biichern L-/J der Odyssee," Hermes, XXXIX (1904), p. 378. On the other hand Rothe presents reasonable and, in my opinion, sufficient grounds for its acceptance (Die Odyssee als Dichtung, Paderborn [1914], pp. 103 if.). I can see no reason for rejecting it, unless we are prepared to maintain that a poet is committed to invariable homogeneity. Furthermore, I am indebted to my former pupil, Dr. F. M. Combellack, of the University of Oregon, for the significant observation that the text which results from excision of the suspected lines exhibits a clear violation of estab- lished Homeric usage in transition from direct speech to narrative; the matter will be treated more fully in a study on which Dr. Combellack is now engaged. It must be remembered also that we are dealing with Mdrchen (cf. Radermacher, op. cit., pp. 23 ff.) and that the two princi- pal motifs in the suspected passage, Lampetia's message and the threat of Helius, seem to be eminently in place in an episode of this nature. I hesitate to refer to the desirability of making clear at this point what is not clear from the words of Circe (/s 137-141) or of Tiresias (X 110-115), that the storm, though sent by Zeus, is a direct punish- ment for the offense against Helius; to the higher critic this will be the surest sign that the passage is interpolated. 23</page><page sequence="24">GEORGE M. CALHOUN. the artist's mood and purpose, the actors may be human beings or equally well, following the tradition of naive anthropomor- phism, gods. It seems to be a clear instance of the invasion of divine mythology by the popular tale. The passage is com- monly regarded as " late " and satiric in intent.48 For this view there is no real evidence; it rests on a preconception which is arbitrary and demonstrably unlikely. Against it are the clear marks of the popular tale, the tone of naive anthropomorphism, and the ingenuous mingling in the closing lines of the reverent with the ridiculous.49 The quarrels and conflicts of the Olympian scenes commonly have their origin in affronts or injuries received by gods from mortals; the anger of Hera and Athena has its source in the judgment of Paris,50 and Poseidon is their ally because of his ill treatment by Laomedon (&gt; 441-457); Poseidon's irritation at the Achaean wall, his anger against Odysseus and against the Phaeacians, and the wrath of Helius are similarly motivated. In the general form of an insult or injury to a supernatural power this is among the commonest of folk motifs. One of its types is the contest to which a mortal provokes a god, as for example B 594-600, Thamyris and the Muses; I 559 f., Idas and Apollo; 0 226-228, Eurytus and Apollo; here might be put the presumptuous words of Niobe to Leto (Q 607 f.). Another common motif is the servitude of a supernatural being to a mortal, which appears several times in the poet's allusions to old tales, as for example, B 766, Apollo's servitude to Admetus; H 452 f., ? 441-457, the year's service of Apollo and Poseidon to Laomedon; somewhat similar is the temporary subjugation of a supernatural being by stratagem, as in the story of Menelaus and Proteus. In our collection of material are also instances of gods foster- ing mortals and immortals, of gods seeking asylum when at- tacked or pursued by enemies, of the wounding of gods by mortals, of gifts given by gods to mortals, of the help and com- panionship constantly vouchsafed by gods to favored human 48 However, cf.

In fact the divine apparatus of the poems, by which the gods are introduced as actors, seems in general to derive from the lairchen element in ancient myth; as divine mythology de- veloped, it took over from folk tale the supernatural motifs which are among its most distinctive features and utilized them in the specific form of divine intervention by anthropomorphic gods.51 A thorough search would probably reveal other common motifs of popular tale in the Homeric portrayal of the gods. For our purpose, however, the quest need not be pursued fur- ther; enough has been given to show that the Olympian scenes are in large part an adaptation of familiar motifs and situations to the poet's themes, and the divine participants not so much his own free invention as traditional figures, gods of ancient myth and folk tale. It would be hard to find a better illustration of the way in which the concepts of folk tale influence Homer's characteriza- tions of the gods than the figure of Hermes,52 who is at once the patron and protector of the Master Thief-in this instance Autolycus-and himself the Master Thief. When he cleverly steals Ares out of the brazen vessel, the feat seems to be part of an ancient tale; when the gods beg him to steal away the body of Hector, the poet is perhaps inventing, but inventing in con- sonance with the characterization of the god familiar from immemorial tradition. When the poet is thinking of gods in general, as superior powers and not as dramatis personae of some ancient story, he is under no limitations save those of his own spirit and imagina- tion; he may think of them and speak of them as the supreme, majestic rulers of the cosmos; he may make them guardians and defenders of the noblest ideals to which the thought of human beings has risen in his day. Nor is this conception necessarily vague or shadowy, or restricted to collective notions of the gods; he may imagine any single one of the gods against a general 1 On the general problem, cf. W. Wundt, " Marchen, Sage und Legende als Entwickelungsformen des Mythus," Arch. Rel.-Wiss., XI (1908), pp. 200-222, especially p. 212. For an excellent discussion of the relation of divine to heroic mythology and of both to folk tale, cf. Nilsson, History of Greek Religion, pp. 38-75, 172-179.

CALHOUN. background of divine grandeur and may depict him as acting on this plane. Apollo as the author of sudden death, or de- scending in awful majesty to smite the Achaeans, wiping out with ineffable might the trench and wall thousands of mortals had toiled to make, blasting with a touch, almost with a ges- ture,53 the mightiest of warriors, represents a majestic concep- tion of the gods; in these appearances he is august and terrible. He is not so impressive when he takes part in an Olympian squabble and is the target of Hera's abuse, or in the Theomachy when he evades Poseidon's challenge, or even when he tricks Achilles by fleeing before him in the form of Agenor; 54 when he is brought into a merry tale of adultery on Olympus to jest with Hermes at the plight of the culprit pair, little is left of his majesty. So Ares, when the poet thinks of him as the embodiment of war, is clothed in terrible grandeur, but he is rather a figure of fun in the Olympian scenes, caught in He- phaestus' net, tumbled with Aphrodite upon the ground by the stout hand of Athena, shut in a brazen pot by the Aloidae, or wounded and sent screaming with pain from the battlefield by Diomede.55 The Helius by whom the heroes swear their solemn oaths is a mighty divinity who sees all and hears all, but in the tale of Ares and Aphrodite he is the husband's spying friend and in the old Mdrchen about his cattle he has to be told of the injury that has been done him and then has to beg Zeus to punish the offenders. The general principle will bear repetition. When the poet is thinking and speaking of the gods as superior beings, supreme rulers of the cosmos, he is free to endow them with whatever attributes of grandeur, nobility and power he 63 One is reminded of the death of Hunding in Die Walkure, where the portrayal of divine omnipotence and human helplessness attains perfection-with the aid of music. When Homer leaves the actual slay- ing of Patroclus to human agency, he is following his usual practice of keeping the supernatural within certain rational limits; cf. "Tele- maque," pp. 161 f.; "Homer's Gods: Prolegomena," pp. 15 f. I hope to treat this subject more fully in a future study. 64 The episode cannot be classed as an Olympian scene, but is closely connected with the scene which has preceded (cf. ? 515-519) and that which follows (X 166-213), and there is a flavor of Mdrchen about Apollo's trick, his taunts, and Achilles' reply. 65 This episode again (ef. n. 54) is closely connected with Olympian scenes and in the same tone. 26</page><page sequence="27">HOMER'S GODS-MYTH AND MARCHEN. likes; he is dealing with a general concept which is progres- sively developed step by step with the thought, feeling, and imagination of humanity; nothing constrains him except the limitations of his own spirit. But when he wishes to introduce the old, naive tales of primitive myth and folk lore, or to allude to familiar episodes in these tales, or perhaps to model new tales or episodes upon this ancient type, he is no longer free; his gods must be the authentic figures of Mdrchen and myth.56 If he wishes to tell the stories in which Zeus is portrayed as boast- ing and bragging, making love to mortal women and goddesses, mauling other gods and flinging them out of Olympus, cringing under the sharp lash of Hera's tongue, or hanging her up by the hands and thrashing her, or threatening to do so, his Zeus will have to be this brutal, blustering, grotesque, pathetic creation of the semi-savage imagination. So also in the case of his human characters; he cannot tell the tale of the one-eyed ogre about Odysseus without substituting for his stately human hero an absurd figure of folk tale.57 As an explanation of the poet's vacillation in his portrayal of the gods between the ridiculous and the sublime, this hypothesis has certain advantages. It does not require us to assume that an artist capable of composing the Iliad was incapable of seeing the gods in more than one aspect, or to postulate as many poets as there are differences in the conceptions of divinity. It frees us from the necessity of overworking the diaskeuast, the inter- polator, the Bearbeiter, and the Flickpoet in order to account for diverse points of view in the text which actually is before us. To me it seems clear, simple, and adequate, and it does violence neither to the text nor to what we know of human nature and the artistic temperament. The general principle was observed 66 This is recognized by Andrew Lang, The World of Homer (New York, 1910), pp. 120-122, and by Erik Heden, Homerische Gitterstudien (Upsala, 1912), pp. 43 f. 67 Though this material may have been, as Nilsson thinks ("Der homerische Dichter in der homerischen Welt," Antike, XIV [1938], p. 31), outmoded, it was evidently too popular with audiences to be dis- carded because of inconsistencies which only conscious criticism dis- cerns (cf. " Homer's Gods: Prolegomena," pp. 16 ff.). However, in view of the long survival of equally primitive material in cult, we may doubt whether it was in any real sense outmoded or old fashioned.</page><page sequence="28">GEORGE M.

The question would not have occurred to the poet or to any of his hearers. Our poet thought of gods as supreme powers, majestic in their sublimity, and he thought of gods as figures in ancient story, actors in many a ridiculous or revolting episode conceived in the semi-savage imagination of a remote past. At times the one conception would be uppermost, at times the other, but poten- tially both were always present in his mind. Both were equally familiar, and he was never troubled by their inconsistency, of which he was unaware. Skepticism lay in the future; the men who would become aware of the inconsistency and be troubled by it and dispute about it and eventually use it as a guide for dissection were still to be born. So, if it pleased the poet to tell a story about the gods that was funny and perhaps indecent, why should not he and his hearers enjoy it to the full? GEORGE M. CALHOUN.
