<plain_text><page sequence="1">the philosophy of human nature 103 The Philosophy of Human Nature. By Chu Hsi. Trans lated from the Chinese by J. Percy Bruce, M.A. 7|x5, xvi+444 pp. London: Probsthain &amp; Co., 1922. This work claims to be a considered rendering of the philosophical chapters 42-8, inclusive, from the complete works of Chu Hsi, whose 49th chapter was translated many years ago by Canon McClatchie, under the title of " Confucian Cosmogony ". The latter translation provoked such caustic criticism that the author wound up his defence by a severe denunciation of the critic (Dr. Chalmers), saying " Foenua habet in cornu ; longe fuge I "?in other words, " He's dangerous ; keep away." That is, perhaps, not quite tho method by which to dispose of honest objections. Dr. Chalmers replied by publishing his version of "One page from Choo Foo-tsze " (?Chu Hsi), and there, so far as I remember, the matter dropped, no one intervening on either side. The general reader may fairly ask : " Who was Chu Hsi ? "? a satisfactory answer to which Mr. Bruce does not provide in the present volume. Chu Hsi (a.D. 1130-1200) was a philosopher, historian, Government official, and commentator. It is in the last character that he is best known. He revised and greatly altered the interpretation by the older scholiasts of the Confucian Canon, his method being uniformity of rendering in dealing with like texts. He was not infallible, he regarded T'ien as an unsubstantial principle. But we are now sure, owing to the,philological labours of Mr. L. C. Hopkins, that T'ien was an anthropomorphic being?-God. Mr. Bruce, however, keeps to the old non-committal term, " heaven," which is scarcely suggestive of Chu Hsi's principle. As a specimen of Mr. Bruce's work, we may quote a few paragraphs from chapter vi, p. 312, on Love, which word he adopts as a translation of jen, rendered by Dr. Legge, inadequately as I think, throughout his Chinese Classics by " benevolence ", instead of by the word " charity " in it?</page><page sequence="2">104 NOTICES OF BOOKS theological acceptation as," charity of heart", now widely recognized as the true rendering. " Love " is at once objectionable on the ground of ambiguity ; and in note 1, Mr. Bruce is driven to state that j?n is " the disposition love ", and that ai, the word in general use, is " the emotion love ". In note 3 ho adds that "j?n is a principal (sic) or law and purely immaterial, but Law can only be discerned in the Ether as its medium of manifestation". What Chu Hsi himself said, according to Mr. Bruce, and to quote a few lines only, runs as follows :? 312. " The two elements which make man to be man are Law, which is the law of Heaven and Earth, and Ether, which is the Ether of Heaven and Earth. Law is without traces and invisible, so that it is only in the Ether that we can see it and if we would understand the meaning of Love, we must think of it as manifested in an all-comprehensive, mild, and gentle Ether." There is no index, which makes a work of 444 pages little available for reference. H. A. G.</page></plain_text>
