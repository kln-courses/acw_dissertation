THE LINGUISTIC IMAGE IN THE INTERPRETATION OF AFRICAN OBJECTS Nigel Barley* The notion of art that in some way 'comments' on the society that produced it presupposes that art is a language or, in important ways, like a language. The notion of the 'language of art' has long been a standard cliche of critics and interpreters and this image, which lurks behind our studies, passes unnnoticed and undiscussed in any treatment of artistic creation. It has been stretched and distorted to the point of disintegration but old images never actually fall apart, instead they take over the language to the point where they become one of the invisible presuppositions that structure our endeavours. But the cliche of the 'communication model' has undergone a further development in recent years in that images that are linguistic in a more technical sense have been grafted onto it. These derive from a more formalised and carefully articulated model that has been developed not in naive notions of language but in the specialised subject of linguistics proper. In this process, anthropology has been largely, but not exclusively an image-taker. There is no doubt that this is primarily due to the conspicuous and rather solitary success of linguistics among those sciences that home in on the area of human behaviour. In linguistics alone, it would seem, there has been a revolution that has borne fruit. New models have been developed that seem demonstrably better than those they supersede. Greater accuracy, formalisation and descriptive power are yields of the new theoretical apparatus. Given this condition, it is not surprising that anthropologists should seek to incorporate parts of the mechanism wholesale into their own more rickety devices. The tendency has gone hand in hand with a shift in the apperception of that distinctively human element that marks out our field of enquiry. From 'Man as functioning social entity' firmly in the grip of a system larger than himself, we pass to a concern with 'Man as a symbolic animal', a creator of systems, structures and symbolic universes. This paradigm is obviously much closer to the traditional concerns of art students than the previous excessively *Fieldwork was conducted in North Cameroon from June 1977 to September 1978 and April 1979 to August 1979. Funding was from the Social Science Research Council, to whom thanks are due. (This paper was prepared for a conference in Visual Art as Social Commentary in Africa organised by John Picton at the School of Oriental and African Studies in November-December 1981. It was originally the intention that a selection of the papers would be published, but this unfortunately did not come to pass. Nigel Barley's paper came at the end of the conference as a critique, indeed, of the very idea of art as a 'commentary'. It is published here more or less as given at that time. - JP)</page><page sequence="2">94 Nigel Barley sociological view that it replaces. Yet there is a real danger here. If the images that we study under the oxymoric name of 'primitive art' are like language in a number of ways, it remains true that they are not language itself. As Black (1962) has shown, it is in the nature of such an image to leave imprecise the imputed similarities between the two terms of the metaphor with possible wide divergencies between different persons who nonetheless accept the comparison as valid. At a certain stage in the decline of a metaphor, it therefore becomes useful to look at some of the basic ways in which it has been used in enlightened enquiry and to seek to pinpoint those features that have made the image relevant and helpful. From here, it should be possible to question whether other areas of the linguistic image are susceptible to colonisation and to suggest how they might be applied to the concrete interpretation of data. It was a feature of the papers at the 'Visual Art as Social Commentary' conference that they sought to embed 'primitive art' firmly in its full local context. Yet it is the most striking feature of the study of non-Western 'art' as currently practised, that it concerns itself almost entirely with the material products of another category - ritual. There is a well established process by which ritual objects, stripped of their ethnographic context and isolated in Western collections become art. That this is so, is not without importance for the use of the linguistic image as seen in the study of alien objects. For no one approaches the study of 'art' from a primarily pragmatic or instrumental perspective. It is one of the principal defining features of the Western notion of 'art' that it is non- functional. Functional aspects are hived off and accorded the lesser title of 'design'. It is interesting to note that, from the local point of view, this concept probably corresponds much more closely to the reality of things than our own concept of 'art'. We may expect, therefore, that the 'naive' local viewpoint would find our interpretations heavily biased towards the semantic. The category 'art' would seem, then, to act as a framing device that sets our objects apart from the rest of the world as surely as the picture frames and glass cases of our museums. But happily, such framing often also occurs in ritual where moments of separateness abound. Spaces are set aside, special regulations are enforced. These criteria enter strongly into our definitions of ceremonies and festivals. The effect of such isolation of objects and actions is the familiar phenomenon of 'semanticisation'. Barthes (1967) has perhaps done more than anyone to show how perfectly ordinary objects, removed from their normal contexts become the subject of symbolic speculation and are thereby heavily semanticised. Studies of alien artefacts as 'art' will therefore tend to be most successful when they are dealing with objects clearly semanticised in their own cultures through use at clearly demarcated festivals and ceremonies. One result of this semanticisation is the stress, within art studies, on the</page><page sequence="3">The linguistic image in the interpretation of African objects ability of visual images and objects to represent. Interpretations of this kind centre on the 'A is/symbolises/represents B' form of model. Typically, studies of this kind employ a somewhat crude idea of word meaning and synonymy. The basic units of the analysis of ritual objects are symbols, the standard definition of these being, from Turner, as things, regarded by general consent as naturally typifying or representing or recalling something by possession of analogous qualities or by association in fact or thought. (Turer 1967: 19) In other words, symbols signify and are motivated. This is already a great departure from the linguistic model whose signs are basically arbitrary. It is the peculiarity of the linguistic analogy, however, to be selectively all things to all men and this gap can easily be bridged by changing the level of the comparison. In poetry, for example, there is a general shifting of the arbitrary features towards motivation. The sound of a word, its phonetic shape are used in rhyme schemes and for evocative purposes. We will therefore find that 'art' objects are not just like language but like poetry. Thus Layton writes, Prosaic speech and mundane graphic design aim to evoke a single level of meaning, while art - like poetry - achieves its effect by giving tangible form to many levels of meaning at once. (Layton 1981: 113) But to limit studies of that Protean term 'meaning' to representation alone is to devalue it gravely. Images do not only refer, they also connote. The materials of which objects are made, the subject matter depicted, conditions of manufacture and display, stylistic features of the image - all these convey information about owners. Often anthropologists will home in on objects as emblems of group affiliation or personal identity, sumptuary relations of status and power. Since the Prague School of linguists, such studies have leaned heavily on language images in the domain of style, register and dialect. An example comes from Fagg: In traditional Africa the language of art is not intertribal... Art, in fact, ... is one of the ways in which a tribe (by its nature an 'in-group') distinguishes itself from its neighbours. (Fagg and Plass 1964: 7) To suggest that on this level of communication objects constitute a language and that they have meaning at anything but the most elementary level, is to stretch the metaphor grossly. It is to ignore the distinction between 'total communicative effect' and 'linguistic meaning' (Leech 1974) that defines the area of central interest to linguistics proper and hives off precisely those aspects that anthropologists have concentrated on. If such objects communicate, then they do so in only the most drearily circular way, deriving their significances from any value that the culture happens to be interested in at the time. Thus, the Russian art treasures once used by the wealthy to cormnunicate their power, affluence and civilisation are now pointed out to the visitor to Soviet Russia as communicating the self-indulgence, spiritual 95</page><page sequence="4">96 Nigel Barley poverty and barbarism of the displaced elite. It is significantly in this least formal and most ad hoc area of linguistics that anthropology has perhaps had its strongest influence back on the study of language; the 'ethnography of speaking' (Hymes 1971) has become recognised as a valid branch of the science.1 But while the 'messages' that such objects express are normally trite and severely limited in scope, they often repose upon a series of more general classifications that are of enormous interest to the anthropologist. Thus, a Benin brass plaque that depicts the Oba swinging leopards by the tail and was once presumably affixed to the beams of his palace, can be unravelled as a conventional statement of his power and authority. It rests, however (Ben- Amos 1976), upon a classification of materials (brass, ivory, coral, wood, etc.), a classification of animals (leopards, cattle, chickens, etc.), a classification of space (vertical, horizontal, non-palace, palace, etc.) to classify men. This is often expressed in terms of objects 'expressing a world view', 'communicating a system of values'. There is often great justification for such turns of phrase. In many studies (e.g. Biebuyck 1973), anthropologists tend, quite naturally, to be most interested in those artefacts used in initiation. The interpretation of these constitutes the instruction of the candidates. However, it is important to note that it is the initiands who do the expressing and communicating, not the objects which are the subject matter of a process of multiple and competitive interpretations. For the objects do not so much 'express' as 'presuppose'. Leech has defined presupposition in its most general form as follows, 'Who utters the truth of X, takes for granted Y.' (Leech 1974: 292). Both language and objects have this ability to demonstrate presupposition. Presupposition implies a whole system of logical relations and equivalences that lie beyond the scope of mere statement. It is on this level that we can talk of themes, classifications and values that we must refer back to in order to interpret. But there is nothing distinctively linguistic about this. Rather it is the point where language and other forms of knowledge meet. If this is linguistics, then it is very much the cognitive end of it. It is rather that language - at its outer levels - is subjected to the same more general processes of interpretation as the rest of the world. The almost infinite flexibility of the linguistic analogy in 'art' is most apparent when we look at the problem of generativity. Over the years, the Western view of the image-maker in primitive society has oscillated between 1 The relationship between art studies and communication theory and network theory is much more complex, with early precursors such as Mauss and Malinowski anticipating more general approaches. It is interesting to speculate how different studies of the kula might have been if the Trobrianders had exchanged with each other anthropomorphic carvings that appealed aesthetically to Westerers, and not shell baubles whose value surely could not be intrinsic.</page><page sequence="5">The linguistic image in the interpretation of African objects two extreme positions, that of a free-thinking innovator ard that of a slave to a coercive cultural tradition. All intermediate points have been represented in the course of this debate. The linguistic analogy, however, provides relevant comparisons for all positions. Fixed phrases that have paradigmatic status are the equivalent of fixed images that permit little, if any, variation. Ordinary language provides a model for a fixed system that nonetheless permits theoretically infinite variation. The relation of regalia to fixed proverbs (McLeod 1976), the apparent diversity of ritual objects within a fixed tradition (Humphrey 1971), the multivariate interpretations of a single image (Biebuyck 1973) can all be happily paired off with the appropriate part of the linguistic analogy. Sooner or later, such models end up discussing definitions of identity. When are two objects 'the same'? Relevant linguistic analogies here are phonemes (where what is similar in one language is distinctively different in another) or writing (Horton 1965: 23) where different realisations are yet 'the same'.2 This very brief survey of some of the ways in which students of alien objects have dissected linguistic concepts and applied the parts to their material suffices to show that, if there are many aspects of objects that have their linguistic correlates, no 'art' system yet studied is anything like as complex or well-formed as a language. Similarities are partial and those selected for comparison vary from one art system to the next. It is because of the distinctive properties that set true language apart from the 'language of art' that we translate the latter into the former in the course of interpretation. What appeals in the hugely various uses made of linguistic concepts seems to be simply its ability to formalise relationships between members of a single set, between different sets, between chains of formatives and between statements, their logical consequences, presuppositions and implications. If this is so, then an outstanding question remains unresolved. Why, following the Chomskyan revolution of linguistics, does anthropology adopt the discarded analytical, 2 Phonemes, being structured, yet in themselves non-referential, yield models for artistic and ritual systems where meaning and form do not show a one-to-one correlation. They can be used to demonstrate non-referential rules of combination (Faris 1972), matrix-like distributions of distinctive features (Layton 1981: 105) and all manner of basic logical relations of the oppositional sort. Indeed, it is the phonological component of an old item and arrangement grammar that constitutes the theoretical basis of structuralism. Saussure has often been regarded as a founding father of structuralism (it being forgotten that he himself was strongly swayed by Durkheim's notion of the coercive nature of social facts). In fact, a far more important element is the phonologist Trubetzkoy. Levi-Strauss's binary opposition is Trubetzkoy's 'bilateral' opposition, Needham's polythetic classification looks much like Trubetzkoy's 'multilateral' opposition (1969: 68). The analogue scale of resemblance, so beloved of anthropologists, is Trubetzkoy's 'homogeneous multilateral' opposition. Ldvi-Strauss's analogy is Trubetzkoy's 'proportional' opposition (1969: 70). Ldvi-Strauss's mediators look like a reworking of Trubetzkoy's 'neutralised archiphonemes' (1969: 79). 97</page><page sequence="6">98 Nigel Barley item and arrangement model and not the synthetic (so-called generative) item and process model that has replaced it in linguistics proper? The answer would seem to lie in a number of considerations. First, analytical grammars are much simpler to construct and require less formalised information to 'work' (Lyons 1968: 158). Then, the analytical approach corresponds more closely to the anthropologist's experience in the field. He is apparently confronted with data that he interprets. Then there is a real difference in the notion of generativity applicable to language and ritual objects. The time-scale is enormously different. Ritual systems, if they generate new rituals and objects do so over many years. Fixity of form is part of our definition of the ritual category. It is also the case that language is most often represented in models as a chain in two dimensions only whereas even the simplest art objects exist simultaneously in many dimensions. One could imagine a generative model used to describe the production of an artefact, say a carving from a single lump of wood, each operation on the material having its counterpart in a sequential rule in the 'grammar' of its production. At the end of it, we would have a description that was totally lacking in insight. It would produce precisely what had been put into it, a mere rephrasing of a conventional description. The power of generative models lies in their ability to effect operations on already formed chains of elements. They exist in a sort of 'logical time' not the real time of the above. Yet there are certainly aspects of alien artefacts that require this power in an adequate description. Let me illustrate with an example from the Dowayo people of North Cameroon. Fig. 1 shows a carved wooden doll ornamented with pokerwork. Such dolls may only be carved by a blacksmith, who makes them from a particularly quick-growing tree. In the form of fig. 1, such an artefact is regarded as a toy and will be given to a little girl to play with. There is no suggestion that this in any way involves an instrumental effect on her fertility. Such dolls are also made in decorated form as in fig. 2. Decoration consists of wrapping the wooden dolls in copious beads, glass or plastic, cowries, red leather and blue and white loincloths. Amulets containing Koranic inscriptions may also be added. Dolls occur in male and female forms, the difference being marked in the form of the genitals and hair. While the male has a star-shaped coiffure like the female, this is not incised in the wood of the hair but composed of strands of wool (imported) poked through a median ridge, together with small strands of beads (fig. 3).3 In this decorated form, dolls are worn around the neck, hanging down over the belly of an infertile woman. The first time she puts it on she will be fed smoked meat in a sauce of sesame or native salt. There could be nothing more simple than this form of 'sympathetic magic' as far as mere description goes. The doll is like the child wished for. If one requires a male child, a male doll is carved, if a female child, a female doll. Whatever view of the world we choose to impute to the 3 An early example of this occurs in Wente-Lukas (1977: 277).</page><page sequence="7">The linguistic image in the interpretation of African objects 99 i.:..

It is interesting to note that while some local missionaries condemn such devices as diabolic, others tolerate them as 'displaying the Dowayos' love of children'. But this very simple and unexceptionable interpretation of the doll as an iconic sign copes only with the tip of an iceberg of submerged structure. First, the decoration of the doll and the eating of smoked meat also occur at the birth, or more precisely the first viewing by the father, of a real child. Once again we can deal with this as a motivated similarity between child and doll. Such an explanation, however, ignores the fact that these elements occur elsewhere in the Dowayo ritual system. A boy is similarly decorated with beads and loincloth on his return from circumcision. He eats smoked meat at the hearths of the village. Moreover, he is decorated with a star-shaped haircut. Similar dress is worn by widows when they come out of mourning at the end of the death-ceremonies of their husbands and by relatives of the deceased at the ceremonies accorded a dead woman's water-jar.4 The linguistic analogy slips now away from mere reference. We might feel that this form of dress 'connotes re-birth, reincorporation into society.' This would fit nicely with a large amount of anthropological experience of such rites of passage. Unfortunately, there are complications, for the haircut, decoration and meal turn up in quite other contexts. There is in Dowayoland a class of pollution diseases called zaase. These may be produced by contact with specific classes of persons such as blacksmiths and sorcerers, or with the dead. Some plants can cause them. The most dangerous and feared class is caused by contact with cultural artefacts such as granaries, hoes, or hearths. Instead of fattening and nourishing a person they may draw the goodness out of him, causing emaciation and death. The cure involves decorating the afflicted person, giving him or her the star-shaped haircut and rubbing them against the offending object. They are fed the smoked meat meal. Hereafter, people and objects are in the correct relationship. It would seem likely, therefore, that the fertility doll is best viewed as a sort of zaase treatment. There is no child with which the woman can be brought into the correct relationship. This, precisely, is her problem. The doll, then, functions as a surrogate. The smoked meat meal, decoration, and star haircut might then be held to collectively signify the passage from the state of zaase. An allusion to the analogy between each single feature and phonemes that can only signify in the presence of others, might be held to be in order if we wish to use the 'standard' linguistic analogy. But such an approach is not descriptively adequate for it ignores the structure of the rich cycle of Dowayo personal and annual festivals that make 4 For a fuller discussion of these see Barley (1983).</page><page sequence="11">The linguistic image in the interpretation of African objects use of zaase. These are best handled with rewrite rules. Circumcision, in standard fashion, divides up into three phases (Rule 1): Rule 1. circumcision --- separation + liminality + integration1 The agrarian rites also exhibit a similar structure, beginning with separation (threshing of millet) and ending with integration (eating of the first fruits): Rule 2. agrarian rites -&gt; separation + liminality + integration2 Rule 3. integration1 -&gt; zaase Rule 4. integration2 - first-fruits But while the agrarian rites may be celebrated on their own, if circumcision has occurred in a village, its end will be collapsed together with the first fruits ceremony and the boys themselves will be treated as first fruits. We can handle this with a Rule 5: Rule 5. integration1 -- (integration1 + integration2)5 Separation, itself, however, is depicted in terms of a myth, 'the beating to death of the old Fulani woman': Rule 6. separation -&gt; 'beating to death of the old Fulani woman' These rules now serve to specify the relations between the various ritual elements of which the dolls are but a part. Circumcision, for example, after the application of the rules, will be performed as: 'Beating to death of the old Fulani woman' + liminality + zaase + first fruits This particular formulation brings together otherwise random prohibitions concerning the dolls in their decorated form. For example, in a village where circumcision is being carried out, such dolls are banned until the boys have safely returned to the village after being cut. Then any woman who has been wearing one of these dolls will put it on to greet the newly circumcised on their return. Moreover, any boy - whether circumcised or not - who is suffering from zaase of hearths and cultural implements will dress up in beads and the 5 This formulation is necessary to prevent excessive recursion. In fact, analysis of all the festivals of the Dowayo ritual system considerably simplifies the rules required and points to certain limitations on the applicability of such formulations.

No approach phrased in terms of 'signifies childbirth' is general enough, while to speak of 'signifying passage from the state of zaase' is merely to rephrase circumstances of use in terms of meaning. A generative approach has the benefit of incorporating these particular objects in the framework of the ritual system and predicting moments when matters as diverse as the wearing of dolls, the curing of pollutions and the eating of the first fruits are collapsed together. I hope this brief example shows that there are some parts of cultural systems where models of the generative sort can prove helpful.6 In conjunction with what was said earlier about the piecemeal way in which anthropologists have applied the linguistic model to ritual objects, we may conclude that two lines of development now seem justified. Firstly, we should not take too seriously our image of 'the language of art' which is a very flawed analogy and should perhaps look at ways in which ritual objects and language are distinctively different. Secondly, there are whole areas of newer linguistic models that may be useful to us. We should not be deterred by the fact that they were developed within another specialist subject with concerns that may seem unlike our own. REFERENCES Barley, N. 1983.
