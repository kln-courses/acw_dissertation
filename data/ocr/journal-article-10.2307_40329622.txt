<plain_text><page sequence="1">320 REVIEWS Road Belong Cargo. By Peter Lawrence. Manchester and Melbourne University Presses, 1964. Pp. I-XVI, 1-291. Price $A4.5o, stiff paper cover edition $A3. The 1940's and 1950^ were marked by an efflorescence of cargo-cult activities in New Guinea and Melanesia. This could well be associated with the political, social and economic disturbances of the war and post-war years, though the origins of such cults were independent of that World War. Articles by missionaries, by adminis- trative officers and by anthropologists appeared with great frequency, especially in the 1950's, and anthropological books on the South Pacific seldom failed to include a section on such cults. Few books, however, have been devoted to a full-length study of the subject, and one of these, Peter Worsley's The Trumpet Shall Sound (1957), was based solely on an analysis of the relevant literature. For books based on first-hand field work, we are left with K. 0. L. Burridge's Mambu (i960) and Peter Lawrence's Road Belong Cargo (1964), which has already appeared in a stiff paper cover edition (1967), and deservedly so. It will become a classic in its sphere. The great merit of the book stems from the clarity and economy of writing, and particularly from the author's comparatively long association with the region, the Rai Coast of New Guinea - a total of about three years spread at intervals between 1949 and 1958. Much documentary research followed. The great attraction of the book is the study in length and depth of a leading cult-figure, Yali, which occupies pages 116 to 221. To have caught this story, to have known and watched the fortunes of this man, and to have written it up was a most fortunate circumstance for anthropology and history. Having read the preceding philosophical and historical sections and so reached page 116, and that is no hardship, the reader is impelled to follow Yali's career and all its context and circumstances until his influence was brought to an end (page 221) ; then of course the reader wants to know what happened later, if there were any revivals of the cargo cult. He also wants to know what Dr. (now Professor) Lawrence made of it all. He will not be disappointed. One other distinguishing feature of Road Belong Cargo is the author's philosophical approach to the subject. He not only, quite early in the book, gives an outline of the religious dogmas of the groups concerned, but then goes on to explain their values and epistemological assumptions. Without an understanding of these, we would not appreciate fully the motives and values which exist in the cargo-cult for those people. As Professor Lawrence says, " The essential materialism and anthropocentrism and the religious basis of their intellectual system were implicit in their conception of the cosmic order ". And again, " Anthropomorphism and materialism were undistin- guished in religion. The world existed for man and he was master of it " ; indeed, " religion was a technology ". Further, it did fax more than reflect man's social values. It governed his whole intellectual life. And so, " except in minor matters, they dismissed the principle of human intellectual discovery ". As this applied in their thinking to all peoples, white or brown, we see the leading clue to the concept of " cargo ". Experience through the decades did not change this epistemological approach. As the author writes near the end of the book, " traditional methods of reckoning time were unaffected by contact ". In cargo doctrine " there was no chronological system which could depict Western technology as the end-product of innumerable years of gradual progress ". There was, indeed, for the Rai Coast people no immense period of time available in the past, only a few generations - just beyond the range of living memory, no further. Consequently, the cult epistemology is logical. Cargo</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 321 ideology has become an intrinsic part of the culture of the southern Madang district. It explains European economic superiority with much greater logic than any description of Western financial transactions, industrial research and organization can ever hope to do. Inevitably, then, for sometime to come, the cargo type of thinking will be expressed in " undesirable reactions to the new economic, political and educational institutions ". To sum up, Road Belong Cargo is an outstanding study of Cargo Cults in a region - a study which is at once historical, biographical and philosophical. A. P. Elkin.</page></plain_text>
