<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW IMITA TIO DAVID WEST, TONY WOODMAN (edd.): Creative Imitation and Latin Literature. Pp. ix+255. Cambridge University Press, 1979. ?12.75. This valuable collection witnesses to the continued success of David West's and Tony Woodman's editorial partnership. It highlights the variety of imitatio and its contribution to the vitality of new writing. Latin literature is the central concern, a Janus figure, looking back to Greece and on towards English masters who sought creative stimulus in their Latin forebears. Donald Russell examines the ancient critical theory and practice. The principles of the successful and acknowledged use of the universal imitatio or mimesis are distinguished from slavish copying. Mimesis operates on a philosophical as well as a literary plane: 'The analogy between the mimetic relationship of works of literature to each other and their mimetic relationship to the outside world proves suggestive' (p. 4). Pessimistic authorities offer the latecomer in imitatio the hope of honourable defeat, others stress his superiority in terms of scope and arrangement. Longinus apart, ancient practice in evaluating imitatio proves more jejune than we might hope and we must turn rather to practitioners than theorists for a profounder understanding of the technique. Other contributors take up this challenge, offering a complementary consensus to clear away residual romantic cobwebs from minds that persist in viewing imitation as the antithesis of originality. Originality is placed fair and square in the field of imitatio cum variatione. Despite the unfortunate jargon accumulated round the concept we must make the serious and exciting attempt to assimilate our own intellect to creative minds employing this technique. It is no mean achievement that the passages and authors analysed emerge with their individual clarity and distinctiveness enhanced. David Bain sets his comparison of Menander's Dis Exapaton fragment with Bacchides 526-61 against a historical discussion of Plautine criticism vis-a-vis Menander. Contrasting characteristics emerge forcefully, with much vindication of Fraenkel. Bain deprecates comparative value judgments but ultimately prefers Menander's realism and psychology to the sophisticated panache of Plautus' theatricality. Ian Du Quesnay's remarks on the Roman challenge to Greek literature are valuable, his minute analysis of Eclogue 2's debt to Theocritus and others, notably Gallus, essential for all students of pastoral. For this subtle piece of contaminatio the process ofdistinguishing elements, speaker, addressee, genre, etc., proves illuminating. Corydon fails as comast and as renuntiator amoris, perpetually in love with the impossible. Contrasts and parallels with his two Theocritean prototypes work simultaneously on the reader defining the image the more precisely. David West analyses the Lucretian and Virgilian plagues by content: aetiology, symptomology, epidemiology and Virgil's independent rhetorical conclusion. For two categories Virgil writes 7 lines to Lucretius' 109 but a 72-line epidemiology answers Lucretius' 10. Virgil's vague introductory quondam against Lucretius' specific: Athens, 430 B.C., exemplifies the difference of approach and purpose. Where Lucretius is clinical, precise, factual, Virgil works on the emotions by paradox, pathos and anthropomorphism. There is a sting in the tail: had one compared Lucretius to Thucydides or Thucydides to his Greek medical authorities the judgment would be different: comparisons are not absolute statements. 48</page><page sequence="2">Colin Macleod, whose recent death will be mourned by all classical scholars, used an ethical approach to Horace's Odes. Imitation of Alcaeus involves as much Horace's conception of Alcaeus the man as it does the poet's words. Influences are absorbed, not merely displayed and permit simultaneous imitation of others; thus in epigram, lyric finds its natural accompaniment. To consider only obvious echoes is unfaithful to Horace's aims and methods. We should not distinguish over-sharply study of imitatio and of poetry within its literary tradition (a point to which Francis Cairns returns in a specifically generic context). Odes 2. 5 (convincingly viewed as self- admonitory) is set against Sappho and the epigrammatists as well as Alcaeus and Anacreon. Horace's fusion of models involves an assessment of their mood and character against his own detached persona. Thus 'Horace tempers the gay arrogance of Anacreon with the sterner mood of Alcaeus...' (p. 98) and 'there is a genuinely ethical strain in Horace's love poetry. For the experience of love is set in an understanding of life and an art of living' (p. 101). In a collection where Virgil is well-served, E. J. Kenney's concluding assessment of the ambiguities inherent to the Aeneid is particularly valuable. He offers us our imitatio within a persuasive chiasmic analysis of Pyrrhus' attack on Priam's palace (2. 469-500). The central panel within the palace (483-90) is answered (501-5) by its desecration. In the first framing simile Homer, Nicander and the Georgics combine in a single malignant image of the snake-like Pyrrhus, an Achilles redivivus; in the second, Homer joins forces with Lucretius in the spate-like tide of the Greek forces. Between these we should look to Ennius, particularly his anguished Andromache, to appreciate the passage's profound emotional tension, with its imagery of rape and profanation. Kenney amply justifies his description of Virgilian imitatio as a 'process of recreative craftsmanship' (p. 119). I would have valued - impossible request - some indication of the likely role of the Iliupersis here. Two contributors tackle the problematical intricacies of self-imitation. Cairns treats Ovid, Amores 2. 9 and 3. 11 in terms of verbal and conceptual similarities and as successive variations on a single generic formula, the (unsuccessful) renuntiatio amoris. Both pivot on a central reaction, 2. 9 using ring-composition, 3. 11 the 'parallel' format of case and counter-case. The first avoids allusion to other renuntiationes by contrast with the more confident 3. 11 where Catullan examples and Ovid's own 2. 9 predominate. Incidentally I missed any reference to Catullus 76, conceptually close despite its different imagery. Similarities to 2. 9 in 3. 11 underline that Ovid has learnt from experience meanwhile: his problem, for example, a specific girl, no vague Cupido, but of course he still loses his case. Tony Woodman's argument that Tacitus plugs gaps in his evidence for two dramatic moments in the Annals with similar eye-witness material from the Histories is admirably lucid, hence my brevity. As an interesting side-dish to the first Annals passage, some elegant Virgilian borrowings reinforce the suggested motive for these self-imitations: delectatio lectoris. K. W. Gransden leads us from Ovid's Lente currite (Am. 1. 13. 40) via the dawn complaint of Chaucer's Troilus to Donne's beautiful 'The Sun Rising', offering for good measure Marlowe's fine rendering of Ovid. Ovidian rhetorical parody and blending of serious erotic content with fanciful mythological embellishment receives its due. Troilus' complaint is contrastingly medieval, and satirical diatribe and strong feeling go hand in hand. Donne mixes the Ovidian and Chaucerian, ending with a metaphysical conceit, appropriate, but the product' of systems and habits of thought unknown to the ancient world' (p. '71). Niall Rudd concludes triumphantly with Pyramus and Thisbe in Shakespeare and Ovid. A fine analysis of the Ovidian version apart, he is at his best examining A THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 49</page><page sequence="3">Midsummer Night's Dream through general Ovidian references, through the burlesque of the Mechanicals' production and finally in discussing the relation of these star-crossed lovers to the serious plot of the play. Remarks on illusion and the status of poetry and love are interesting and the play emerges as one of transposition, translation and transformation: 'The result was Shakespeare's Metamorphoses- the most magical tribute Ovid was ever paid' (p. 193). Just such metamorphoses are the subject of this book and ample tribute is meticulously paid them. The Queen's University of Belfast ANNA CRABBE ROMAN LANDSCAPES JUTTA ROMER: Naturisthetik in der friihen rimischen Kaiserzeit. (European University Studies, xv. 22.) Pp. 145. Frankfurt am Main/ Bern: Peter D. Lang, 1981. Paper, 34 Sw. frs. The late Republican and early Imperial enthusiasm for the countryside appears in some sort to have anticipated Petrarch's response to nature: at least, as quoted by Miss Romer, he subscribes to the ancient commonplaces about a green study. But whether this inclination to rustic retreat represented something new seems to me a more difficult proposition: the mere quantity of Roman testimony for the vogue should not blind us to the less well attested background against which the sensibility in question was formed. Greater wealth and leisure help to explain the dissemination of the cult of nature, but not the basic lineaments of the attitudes involved. F. G. Jiinger, quoted on p. 134, sensibly remarks that nature is man's mirror, and that man can be found there even when not present :1 in landscape representation, the moods displayed are human. R. finds a potent force in Epicureanism, which explained the inexplicable, thus rendering nature safe, and allowing the individual to find a new self-confidence. But what else is found reflected in the mirror? Of Stoicism, and its awe in front of the grand design, there is no real account; nor of the diatribe, from which stemmed that moralising primitivism which only admitted the unadorned face of nature, censuring presumptious human efforts to improve what God had given. Although R. collects an interesting body of illustrations, she tends to extrapolate straight from it, and from material conditions, to the mentality behind the descriptions; and is insufficiently alert to the different currents contained in them. Her witnesses are Cicero, Horace, Ovid, Seneca, Pliny, Martial and Statius: but even here, with writers composing predominantly towards the middle and lower end of the stylistic spectrum, and therefore more susceptible to direct interpretation, differing responses intermingle. The gardens of Alcinous were balanced by Laertes' humbler patch: so, likewise, simplicity and ornament provide the Roman standpoint with its canons. Not only that: besides the primitivistic bias, and the estate-agent's liking for artifice, there was also a more open spatial sense which saw nature in the round, including the grandiose and the awful. One thinks of the Vatican Odyssey landscapes, of the proem to Lucretius 2, and the second book of Cicero's DND. Unfortunately, R. omits discussion of the higher forms, where this feeling for the prospect, for nature as a continuum, most makes its presence felt. And in all these cases - the various tastes for the homely, the artificial, and the sublime - there is Hellenistic precedent: the moral sermon, for instance, the pavilion of Ptolemy described by Athenaeus, and the seascapes of Apollonius. R. talks of precedent, but does not cite it, being more concerned with her 50 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW</page></plain_text>
