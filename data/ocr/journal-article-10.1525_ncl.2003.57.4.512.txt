<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Homosociality and the Aesthetic in Henry JamesÕs Roderick Hudson M ICHéL E  MENDEL S SOHN ~he yoking of art and life was one of the  fulcra of Henry JamesÕs Þction. In an oft-cited letter to H. G. Wells dated 10 July 1915, James con- tends: ÒIt is art thatmakes life, makes interest,makes importance, for our consideration and application of these things, and I know of no substitute whatever for the force and beauty of its process.Ó1 If art Òmakes life,Ó can art therefore palliate for deÞ- ciencies in oneÕs own life? My interest in this essay is in JamesÕs treatment of homosociality and aesthetics in Roderick Hudson (1875), particularly the relationship between the wealthy art patron Rowland Mallet and the sculptor Roderick Hudson, and the ways in which this relationship duplicates the novelÕs aes- thetic concerns.2 I examine JamesÕs insistent intertwining of Nineteenth-Century Literature, Vol. 57, No. 4, pp. 512Ð541.

According to Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Òthe word ÔhomosexualÕ entered Euro-American discourse during the last third of the nineteenth-centuryÓ (the time when James wrote Roderick Hudson), and it refers to a Þxed notion of sexuality (Epistemology of the Closet [Berkeley and Los Angeles: Univ. of California Press, 1990], p. 2). In this essay I prefer the terms ÒhomosocialityÓ and Òho- moerotic,Ó with ÒhomoeroticÓ indicating same-sex desire or sexual pleasure, and Òho- mosocialityÓ describing same-sex social bonds and a range of relationsÑincluding, but not limited to, homosexuality.

In recent readings of same-sex relations in JamesÕs works, critics have skirted the issue of the aesthetic implications of ho- mosociality; 3 likewise, in discussions of Jamesian aesthetics, critics have not considered JamesÕs homosocial artistry.4 The novelÕs latent and patent homosexuality has not been linked to JamesÕs aesthetic concerns within it. In this essay I want to sug- gest that JamesÕs aesthetic views are encapsulated in his inter- pretation of homosocial bonds and Catholicism. I argue that in Roderick Hudson James uses aestheticized Catholicism and the homoeroticized patron-artist relationship as means of palliating psychological and sexual fragmentation. Unable to act, Row- land is a failed âneur and an incompetent entrepreneur who is psychologically and sexually fragmented because he is alien- sire, Sedgwick demonstrates that there is a host of affective relations between men that are not always genetic and that homosociality is not homosexuality. She traces a con- tinuum between the homosocial and homosexual, between varieties of male bonding and homosexual behavior as Òa strategy for making generalizations about, and marking historical differences in, the structure of menÕs relations with other menÓ (Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick,Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire [New York: Colum- bia Univ. Press, 1985], p. 2). 3 See, for example, Kelly Cannon,Henry James and Masculinity: The Man at the Mar- gins (London: Macmillan, 1994); Hugh Stevens,Henry James and Sexuality (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ.

For Rowland patronage serves as a brace for his internal disjunctionsÑor, to paraphrase T. S. EliotÕs speaker in The Waste Land (1922), as a means of shoring up his fragments against his ruin. Patronage allows Rowland the possibility of evading the morality and work ethic of his Puritan kith and kin; likewise, aestheticized Catholicism permits modes of being that Protestantism does not condone. Roderick does for Rowland what Rowland cannot do for himselfÑthus making Rowland a creator, as it were, at one re- move. In this sense Rowland Mallet is a Pygmalion Þgure: ini- tially enamored of RoderickÕs statue, Rowland brings it to life (through his patronage) and becomes equally fond of its hu- man incarnation, Roderick. (Roderick, then, is RowlandÕs Gal- atea.) James had rehearsed a version of the Pygmalion theme in ÒThe Last of the ValeriiÓ (1874)Ña story whose plot J. Hillis Miller succinctly summarizes as ÒItalian Hubby Betrays Ameri- can Heiress in Love Affair with Statue.Ó5 The story appeared in the January 1874 issue of the Atlantic Monthly, exactly one year before Roderick Hudson began its serial run in the magazineÕs January 1875 issue.6 As a patron Rowland not only acquires someone who  can create for him, but he also acquires what I term the Òright to sightÓ: a socially and contractually sanctioned justiÞcation for watching his ward. In Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality (1905), Sigmund Freud argues that scopophiles reify the ob- jects of their gaze, and that sexually tinged looking Òoffers them a possibility of directing some proportion of their libido on to higher artistic aims.Ó 7 By watching Roderick, Rowland can ful- Þll both his artistic interests and his sublimated homoerotic drive, and this in turn provides him with the psychological vin- culum he requires. In this sense, the shorthand for RowlandÕs unifying strategy might be Òveni, vidi, vinxi.Ó 8 5 Miller,Versions of Pygmalion (Cambridge,Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1990), p. 212.

His days are Òbroken into a dozen conscious de- vices for disposing of the hours, and intermingled with sighs, half suppressed, some of them, for conscienceÕ sake, over what he failed of in action.Ó 9 Rowland MalletÕs inaction and psychic fragmentation are central to Roderick Hudson, for from the Þrst chapter Rowland is depicted as a paragon of the split soul: he has an Òaptitude for beneÞcenceÓ but easily woos himself Òto egotismÓ (Roderick, pp. 168, 170); he has no artistic talent but is fond of the arts and wants to go abroad to bring back pictures to donate to an American city.10 Early in the novel the narrator emphasizes this duality: [Rowland] had frequent Þts of extreme melancholy, in which he declared that he was neither Þsh nor ßesh nor good red herring. He was neither an irresponsibly contemplative nature nor a stur- dily practical one, and he was forever looking in vain for the uses of the things that please and the charm of the things that sustain. He was an awkward mixture of strong moral impulse and restless 3⁄4sthetic curiosity, and yet he would have made a most ineffective reformer and a very indifferent artist. (pp. 176 Ð77) RowlandÕs ambivalence and concurrent inability to act result in phlegmatism. Max Weber (quoting Friedrich Schiller) famously deÞned modernity as Òthe Ôdisenchantment of the worldÕÓ and charged modern manÕs reliance on reason as the chief cause of this malaise.11 In this sense modernism can be understood, in Ross PosnockÕs words, as Òa return of the repressed.Ó12 Rowland is a precursor of Weberian disenchantmentÑhis repressive pu- 9 Henry James, Roderick Hudson, in his Novels, 1871–1880, ed.

Further references are to this edition and are included in the text. 10 Rowland mentions wanting to acquire paintings by Botticelli and Ghirlandaio in order to donate them to a city for the beneÞt of the American public (see Roderick, p. 170). In this respect, Rowland Mallet is a precursor for Adam Verver in The Golden Bowl (1904), a connoisseur who, having made his fortune, wants to collect every per- fect artifact in order to establish a museum in American City. 11 Max Weber, ÒScience as VocationÓ (1919), in From Max Weber: Essays in Sociology , ed. and trans.

Brought up according to puritanically inßuenced ascetic strictures, RowlandÕs father had a Òwill of steelÓ and Òwas not a sentimentalÓ man (pp. 175, 174). RowlandÕs mother teaches him that sentiment is a ÒprivateÓ thing, literally to be kept in an inner sanctum, and in this respect she is paradigmatic of Row- landÕs own split psyche and restrained sentiment. ÒMrs. Mallet was a woman of an exquisite moral toneÓ whose marriage to RowlandÕs father was Òan immitigable error,Ó and Rowland, as an adolescent, discovers that Òhis mother had been for Þfteen years a perfectly unhappy womanÓ who hid her true emotions (pp. 174 Ð75). On her deathbed she admits to Rowland that her only solace was to Òcultivate . . . a little private plot of sen- timent, and it was of this secluded precinct that, before her death, she gave her son the keyÓ (p. 175). The object-relations school of psychoanalysis, associated with Melanie Klein, D. W. Winnicott, and Margaret S. Mahler, offers an explanation of the childÕs relation to the mother that elucidates RowlandÕs emotional paralysis. Indeed, this theory emphasizes the centrality of the primary relationships between the child and its objects (particularly the mother) and reveals that they signiÞcantly shape the childÕs personality and self- identity. Julia Kristeva concurs that the mother Òmediates the symbolic law organizing social relations and becomes the or- dering principle.Ó 13 RowlandÕs discovery that his mother wore Òa mask . . . by her husbandÕs orderÓ (Roderick, p. 175) is a Òmo- mentous oneÓ because it iterates and mirrors his own restraint. The fact that Mrs. Mallet gives her son Òthe keyÓ to the secret garden of sentiment limns his own emotional strategy, repres- sion. This containment is symbolized by the Òsecluded pre- cinctÓ of emotion, which the Mallets kept under lock and key. Thus, RowlandÕs ambivalence and consequent lethargy can be read as the result of the repression of his sentiments and his failure to acknowledge his true nature. RowlandÕs failure to accept his split nature is apparent in his conversation with the Cavaliere Giacosa. In chapter 10 the Cav- 13 Revolution in Poetic Language, trans.

One suffers horribly at what the other does.Ó Row- land blankly responds, ÒI donÕt understand double people, Cav- aliereÓ (p. 435). AlthoughRowland is double, he has suppressed his sentimental side to such an extent that he can no longer ac- knowledge it in himself or others. This schizoid structuring of the self engenders a hypotonic existence: as a result of his psy- choemotional splitting, Rowland is emotionally paralyzed: he cannot choose between Òeither/orÓ and ÒandÓ; he prefers to re- main on the boundary of indecision and decision. Rowland is all fear and trembling and is therefore unable to act.14 Although critics have tended to construe Roderick and Rowland as opposites on the basis of passionÑthe former as tout feu tout ame, the latter as a wet blanketÑsuch an interpre- tation is unnecessarily reductive and confuses the symptom with its cause: Rowland is passionless because he is plagued by indecision. It is crucial to understand the Þnesse of JamesÕs point here: RowlandÕs inability to act has, as its logical conse- quence, a laissez-faire life of inertia. Rather than having Row- land choose a life of indolence (which to JamesÕs sense would have been morally objectionable), James sensitively portrays the way in which the dolce far niente has been foisted upon Òpoor RowlandÓ (p. 183). Indeed, James repeatedly indicates that such a life, because it is not led by personal choice and does not in- volve self-realization, is ultimately a living death. ÒLotus-eatingÓ increases oneÕs Òliability to moral miseryÓ (p. 171). Rowland is aware, nevertheless, that action and production are fundamental elements of life, for Òit seemed to him that the glow of happiness must be found either in action, of some im- mensely solid kind, on behalf of an idea, or in producing a masterpiece in one of the artsÓ (p. 177). Able neither to act nor to produce, Rowland resolves to search outside himself for happiness, determining that he can achieve vicarious felicity by becoming a patron of the arts. Patronage provides a pretext for the realization of his own dream, since he often Òwished he were a vigorous young man of genius, without a pennyÓ (p. 177). 14 Speaking to Rowland, the artist Sam Singleton says of Roderick: ÒAh, thereÕs a man . . . who has taken his start once for all, and doesnÕt need to stop and ask himself in fear and trembling every month or two whether he is advancing or not. When he stops, itÕs to rest!Ó (p. 261; emphasis added). </page> <page sequence="7"> 518 nineteenth-century l iterature As RoderickÕs patron, Rowland essentially serves as a cata- lyst. He goads Roderick into action while remaining inactive himself; RowlandÕs ÒpartÓ is Òthat of usefulness, pure and sim- pleÓ (p. 394). Being useful, like being a catalyst, is not in itself an action, but it generates action: it is ipso facto a passive- aggressive mode of existence. When asked by RoderickÕs em- ployer, the lawyer Striker, to tell Mrs. Hudson Òjust what [he] propose[s] to do with her sonÓ (p. 204), Rowland makes clear that Roderick is the one who will be entirely responsible for the doing: ÒÔDo, my dear madam?Õ demanded Rowland. ÔI donÕt propose to do anything. He must do for himself. I simply offer him the chance. HeÕs to study, to workÑhard, I hopeÕÓ (p. 205). Initially, patronage is construed as a Þnancial investment. Wendy Graham contends that Òthe pecuniary relationship be- tween the two men [Rowland and Roderick] is a variation on what [Eve Kosofsky] Sedgwick has called Ôqueer tutelageÕÓ (Graham, Henry James’s Thwarted Love, p. 105).15 This argu- ment, however, overlooks the reproductive symbolism implicit in making money. If Rowland Mallet is interested in Roderick Hudson, then it is also because the relationship provides Row- land with a mode of (pro)creation: making money is a sublima- tion for making love. Like a successful stockholder whose in- vestments make money and thus work for him so that he does not have to, Rowland understands patronage to mean that the artist works, creates, and (re)produces for his patron. Rowland construes his role as that of an adoptive parent of the arts rather than a genetic one: buying art is an ersatz for creative ac- tion. RowlandÕs lethargy denotes that he is unproductive, but it connotes that in commissioning Roderick, Rowland is asking him to produce what he himself cannot. Rowland Òcould only buy pictures, and not paint them; and in the way of action, he had to content himself with making a rule to render scrupulous moral justice to handsome examples of it in othersÓ (Roderick, p. 177). The juxtapositions of buying and painting, action and moral judgment reveal the intricacies of RowlandÕs rationale. Because Rowland sees Roderick as action incarnate, and be- cause Roderick is a Òhandsome example,Ó Rowland comes to 15 Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick uses the phrase Òqueer tutelageÓ in her Tendencies (Dur- ham, N.C.: Duke Univ. Press, 1993), p. 91. </page> <page sequence="8"> RODERICK HUDSON 519 believe that his role is Òto render scrupulous moral justiceÓ to Roderick. This sense of moral duty, however, is also the reason why Roderick comes to resent Rowland and angrily tells him: ÒYou canÕt feel for me nor judge for meÓ (p. 496). For Rowland scopophilia is a means of palliating his inabil- ity to express himself artistically or emotionally. The scopophile, or voyeur, derives pleasure from looking at another person as an erotic object. For Freud the scopophilic drive is a compo- nent instinct of sexuality that is not governed by the erogenous zones and is revealed by a tendency to objectify people and subject them to a controlling gaze.16 The scopophileÕs gaze not only eroticizes but also objectiÞes, and in extreme cases Òit can become Þxated into a perversion, producing obsessive voyeurs and PeepingToms whose only sexual satisfaction can come from watching, in an active controlling sense, an objectiÞed other.Ó17 In The Tragic Muse (1890) James recapitulates the theme of  voyeurism: the actress Miriam Rooth is seen almost entirely through the eyes of othersÑparticularly those of Peter Sher- ringham, whom Philip Horne calls Òher fascinated diplomat sponsor-lover.Ó 18 By becoming RoderickÕs patron, Rowland ac- quires a Òright to sightÓ: his scopophilia is contractually and so- cially sanctioned because watching his ward becomes his duty. Rowland can actualize himself aesthetically through Roderick and thus mediate his internal disjunctions. Scopophilia is a means of palliating his inability to express himself artistically or emotionally. Secularized, aestheticized Catholicism is another means of navigating between the Scylla of the egoistic claims of the aesthetic and the Charybdis of the selßess and immoderate devotion to morality. Similarly, homosociality compensates for RowlandÕs alienation. Catholicism emphasizes the brotherhood of all believers; homosociality emphasizes the brotherhood of all men. My in- tent here is to consider Catholicism not as a theological entity but as a residual cultural determinant: I will examine the way in which its treatment is symptomatic of the Protestant context 16 See Freud,Three Essays, p. 156. 17 Laura Mulvey, ÒVisual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema,Ó in Literary Theory: An An- thology , ed.

While I am not seeking to associate the novelÕs aesthetic consciousness exclusively with Catholic religious iconography, it is important to acknowledge the Catholic elements as simultaneous enactments of the aes- thetic and moral sense. The novelÕs treatment of homosociality and Catholicism reveals a chiasma between art and life, and this chiasma connotes a Òcrossing overÓ to the other sexual side, in the same sense that cross-dressing and cross-gendering do. Patronage in the novel is a pretext for the blurring of sex- ual lines; moreover, I perceive a second chiasmatic instance in the aestheticization of Catholicism. We can picture this as a lit- eral ÒCrossing overÓ of art, where the Catholic Cross is brought to bear on the ofÞce of art in a manner similar to No mie Nio- cheÕs painting of a crimson cross over one of her paintings in The American (1877). James was brought up in a religious environment, but, as John T. Frederick notes: ÒTo Henry James, religion was a matter of conduct, not of church membership or acceptance of a stated creed. Further, it was less a matter of external action than of internal attitude and motive.Ó19 In The Catholic Side of Henry James Edwin Sill Fussell argues that the inßuence of friends and contemporary writers, along with the rise of Catholicism and Catholic Þction in America, may have provided an impetus for James to explore the theme in his works.20 Moreover, JamesÕs lifelong friendship with John La Farge may have inßuenced his writing: La Farge was a painter and writer, and in Notes of a Son and Brother (1914) James recalled that La FargeÕs Òbeing a Cath- olic, and apparently a ÔrealÕ one . . . , [made] perhaps by itself the greatest difference.Ó21 Although, as Fussell notes, James was always Òdeliciously vagueÓ about religion (Catholic Side, p. 27), critics have generally assumed that he was more of a secularist than anything else. Likewise, the Catholicity of his characters in Roderick Hudson is subsumed by secular and humanistic alle- giances and stripped of its meaning qua religious orthodoxy. 19 The Darkened Sky: Nineteenth-Century American Novelists and Religion (Notre Dame: Univ. of Notre Dame Press, 1969), p. 242. 20 See The Catholic Side of Henry James (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ.

According to Robert Emmet Long, by the time that James began working on Roderick Hudson, HawthorneÕs novel was already ÒÞrmly established as a ÔclassicÕ work about Ameri- cans in Rome; it was as much a part of the American travellerÕs equipment in Rome, James once remarked, as his Murray.Ó 22 And Theodore E. Stebbins, Jr. notes that Ònearly every Ameri- can who left behind a journal of his travels in Italy before 1870 recorded some degree of aversion to Catholicism,Ó 23 as does The Marble Faun. Like Kenyon and Hilda in HawthorneÕs novel, Protestant Americans visiting Italy were shocked both by the carnivalesque, convert-hungry Catholic world they encoun- tered and by the galleries replete with Òimpure pictures.Ó 24 This hostile distaste, however, was commingled with Romantic adula- tion, and it was this tradition that James ambivalently absorbed and attacked. According to Paul Giles, the lure of the visual arts was, for better or worse, at the heart of Protestant AmericansÕ concep- tion of Catholicism: Catholicism has traditionally relied upon the allure of im- agesÑMadonnas, cruciÞxes, and so onÑmuch more than Puri- tanism, which traditionally harbors a deep suspicion of the power of art and artiÞce. . . . visualization is often associated by Ameri- can writers with a blind Catholic adherence to faith in contrast to the Protestant emphasis upon intelligent interrogation of super- Þcial appearances.25 Rowland Mallet is attracted to CatholicismÕs aesthetic incarna- tion because it can provide something that patronage also pro- 22 Robert Emmet Long, ÒJamesÕsRoderick Hudson: The End of the ApprenticeshipÑ Hawthorne and Turgenev,Ó American Literature, 48 (1976), 312.

By aestheticizing Catholicism, moreover, James empha- sizes the relationship between the moral and the aesthetic and, by the same token, demonstrates that such a cross-pollination can be proÞtable. In Roderick Hudson the religious dimension is transformed: secularized, socialized, aestheticized. Yet despite this spiritual stripping, Catholicism remains of value because it permits and promotes modes of being that Protestantism does not condone. In his early stories Henry James consistently returns to the connections and disjunctions between aesthetics and ethics or religionÑbetween the emphases of the present over those of the pastÑin order to inßect his prose with a new moral tone. In ÒTravelling CompanionsÓ (1870) the narrator Mr. Brooke and his companion Miss Evans look at TintorettoÕs Crucixion , and he asks her, ÒWhat is it here . . . that has moved you most, the painter or the subject?Ó She replies, ÒI suppose itÕs the subject. And you?Ó to which he responds: ÒIÕm afraid  itÕs the painter.Ó 26 Tony Tanner hears an Òapologetic noteÓ in Mr. BrookeÕs response that Òindicates sufÞciently that this would not have been a common answer at this time.Ó 27 The passage also indicates that stripping religious icons of their religious signiÞcance in favor of appreciating their aesthetic value was a theme that James had explored elsewhere and returned to in Roderick Hudson. In ÒThe Madonna of the FutureÓ (1873), after Theobald rhapsodizes about RaphaelÕs Madonna in the Chair, H---, the narrator of the inner story, reminds him that during RaphaelÕs time ÒpeopleÕs religious and 3⁄4sthetic needs went arm in arm, and there was . . . a demand for the Blessed Virgin, visi- ble and adorable.Ó But, he concludes, ÒI am afraid there is no demand now.Ó 28 Here, as in Roderick Hudson, James does not 26 Henry James, ÒTravelling Companions,Ó in Complete Stories, 1864–1874, p. 525. 27 Venice Desired (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ.

RowlandÕs visit to the Church of Saint Cecilia in chapter 7 instances the conßicting and conßating drives that I have de- scribed. Like Strether inThe Ambassadors (1903), George Stran- som in ÒThe Altar of the DeadÓ (1895), and a host of other men in JamesÕs Þction who wander into Catholic churches to Þnd women worshiping at the altar, Rowland Ònever passed it [Saint CeciliaÕs] without going in,Ó and this time he Þnds a woman Òat her prayers at one of the side altarsÓ (Roderick, p. 345). Why would Rowland, the offspring of Òa rigid Puritan stockÓ (p. 172), regularly attend a Catholic church? His actions elucidate his motive: ÒRowland walked to the altar, and paid, in a momentary glance at the clever statue of the saint in death, in the niche beneath it, the usual tribute to the charm of polished ingenuityÓ (p. 345). Here the prose is exceptionally opaque: it is not clear what the Òusual tributeÓ paid Òto the charm of pol- ished ingenuityÓ is. The lexicon, however (altar, momentary glance, clever statue, tribute, polished ingenuity), yokes Catho- lic imagery and visual appreciation thereof, clarifying RowlandÕs impulse. When Rowland steps up to the altarÑi.e., the com- munion tableÑhe is communing with the art itself, appreciat- ing it solely on aesthetic rather than religious grounds, just as Mr. Brooke does in ÒTravelling Companions.Ó The fact that the statue is referred to as ÒcleverÓ and Òpolished ingenuityÓ under- scores RowlandÕs aesthetic focus and indicates his aggressive disavowal of any religious response. Here he does not gaze but rather glances momentarily, as if fearful of the pieceÕs power. The glance is ßeeting and ßirtatious and, contrary to the gaze, does not involve permanent or deeper commitment. Still, Row- landÕs glance is transgressive: it venerates an icon for its beauty rather than for its spiritual value. Rowland does not conßate the sign and signiÞer, as Protestant iconoclasts accused Catho- lics of doing, but instead he radically disassociates them, appre- ciating the icon only for its beauty and not for its religious or spiritual signiÞcance. Having paid his respects to the Òclever statue,Ó Rowland Þnds that the woman Òsitting in a listless attitudeÓ (Roderick, </page> <page sequence="13"> 524 nineteenth-century l iterature p. 345) against a column is none other than Christina Light, the beauty to whom Roderick is so deeply attracted. ÒHave you never felt in any degree,Ó Rowland asks her, Òthe fascination of Catholicism?Ó (p. 346). His negation (ÒneverÓ instead of ever) and ChristinaÕs response (ÒYes, I have been through that, too!Ó) imply that he has felt the Òfascination.Ó ChristinaÕs effusive re- counting of her putative desire to become a nun fails to con- vince Rowland of the veracity of Òher religious experience.Ó Comparing himself to Christina, Rowland concludes: ÒI am afraid that I am sadly prosaic . . . for in these many months now that I have been in Rome, I have never ceased for a moment to look at Catholicism simply from the outside. I donÕt see an opening as big as your Þnger-nail where I could creep into it!Ó (p. 347). Fussell claims that this passage is ÒobscureÓ because Òit is . . . unclear what comparison is proposed by an entity into which you would creepÓ (Catholic Side, p. 75).29 But RowlandÕs idiom clearly associates the religious with the visual and rein- forces the sense that his appreciation of Catholicism is an aes- thetic one. RowlandÕs manipulation of the inside/outside di- chotomy is most revelatory of his outlook: he is fascinated by Catholicism because it offers something to look atÑas does ÒbeautifulÓ RoderickÑand satisÞes his scopophilic desires. Rowland is interested in looking at Catholicism Òsimply from the outside,Ó as an onlooker rather than a believer; he can- not Òcreep into itÓ because he is not interested in its substance, its religious core. Rowland is like Christopher Newman in The American, who, while looking at a painting of the Madonna, says: ÒI am not a Catholic, but I want to buy it.Ó 30 For Rowland it is not the faith but the artiÞce of the Roman Church that holds Òfascination.Ó Rowland does have some religious sentiment, even if it is not speciÞcally Catholic. Notwithstanding his bald reply to the Franciscan frate in Fiesole who proposes to offer a mass for himÑÒI am not a CatholicÓ (Roderick, p. 373)ÑRowland is not 29 Fussell also suggests that Rowland may be making an oblique reference to Mat- thew 19:24, where Jesus says: ÒIt is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a nee- dle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of GodÓ (see Catholic Side of Henry James, p. 75). 30 Henry James,The American, in Novels, 1871–1880, p. 518. </page> <page sequence="14"> RODERICK HUDSON 525 an atheist, since he admits: ÒI believe in GodÓ (p. 347). Like George Dane in ÒThe Great Good PlaceÓ (1900), Rowland is one of Òthe great Protestant peoples,Ó but he Þnds happiness in Catholicism and its Ògood Brothers.Ó 31 Protestantism holds that the individual can have a personal connection to God, that he does not need the mediating power of a priest or the support of a community. Rowland, however, is alienated from himself and from the puritanical elements of the United States because of his inability to conform to social stereotypes about both eco- nomic productivity and sexual reproductivity. His urge to be- come a patron of the arts is a manifestation of his attempt not only to repair his internal disconnections but also to insert himself into the art scene and become part of its community. Nevertheless, when Christina says to him, ÒPlease tell me about your religion,Ó he cannot describe it to her: ÒTell you about it? I canÕt!Ó said Rowland, with a good deal of emphasis. She ßushed a little. ÒIs it such a mighty mystery it cannot be put into words, nor communicated to my base ears?Ó ÒIt is simply a sentiment that makes part of my life, and I canÕt detach myself from it sufÞciently to talk about it.Ó (Roderick, p. 348) Rowland cannot detach himself from his religion enough to speak about it because it is a means for him of resolving his aes- thetic and moral alienation. Although RowlandÕs faith is un- doubtedly secularized, by adhering to both Protestant mor- alsÑmanifest in his encouragement of a Protestant work ethic in others, particularly in RoderickÑand Catholic aesthetics, he creates a psychological vinculum that alleviates his sense of alienation. By seeing, he is healed. In his conversation with Christina, Rowland amalgamates two types of sentiment: the religious and the romantic. Indeed, ChristinaÕs comment about Òa mighty mystery [that] cannot be put into wordsÓ is suggestive of what Lord Alfred Douglas, in his poem ÒTwo LovesÓ (1892), euphemistically referred to as 31 See Henry James, ÒThe Great Good Place,Ó in hisComplete Stories, 1898–1910, ed. Denis Donoghue (New York: Literary Classics of the United States, 1996), pp. 162, 170. </page> <page sequence="15"> 526 nineteenth-century l iterature Òthe love that dare not speak its name.Ó 32 It seems to me that Rowland is talking on two levels here, the religious and the ro- mantic. In his explanation to Christina he is covertly referring to Roderick: ÒIt is simply a sentiment that makes part of my life, and I canÕt detach myself from it sufÞciently to talk about it.Ó When he writes to Cecilia a month later, Rowland admits that he cannot look at Roderick objectively or merely as a Þnancial investment because he is too bound up with him emotionally: I have done my best, and if the machine is running down I have a right to stand aside and let it scuttle. Amen, amen! No, I can write that, but I canÕt feel it. I canÕt be just; I can only be gener- ous. I love the poor fellow and I canÕt give him up. (p. 358) If there is anything that Rowland cannot detach himself from sufÞciently, it is Roderick: Rowland clings to him for the same reasons that he clings to Catholicism. The agape that Rowland shows RoderickÑÒI can only be generous. I love the poor fel- lowÓÑis a sublimated form of eros. Rowland can only be gener- ous (show agape) because this is a sanctioned homosocial bond, whereas love between men is not. He takes his investment in Roderick to heart because it is not merely a Þnancial invest- ment but also an emotional one. Catholicism provides a com- munity of brothers and sanctions agape; in contrast to eros, agape is wholly unselÞsh and outgoingÑit is Christian love proper. As a result, the homosocial bond is reinforced, even if the ho- moerotic one is not sanctioned or acted upon. By sanctioning homosocial interaction, Catholicism gives Rowland a means of sublimating his desire by grounding his actions in agape rather than eros. Rowland is not only buying RoderickÕs artwork but also Òbuying the picture,Ó in the sense that patronage becomes a means for him to paint himself into the tableau vivant of the Roman art worldÑor at least for him to have the right to watch it, as the following excerpt implies: When the two ladies [Madame Grandoni and Miss Blan- chard] withdrew, [Rowland] attended them to their carriage. 32 Lord Alfred Douglas, ÒTwo LovesÓ (1892), rpt. in The Chameleon: A Facsimile Edi- tion (London: Eighteen Nineties Society, 1978), p. 28. </page> <page sequence="16"> RODERICK HUDSON 527 Coming back to the drawing-room, he paused outside the open door; he was struck by the group formed by the three men. . . . Rowland stood looking on, for the group [of artists: Roderick, Gloriani, Sam Singleton] struck him with its picturesque symbol- ism. Roderick, bearing the lamp and glowing in its radiant circle, seemed the beautiful image of a genius which combined sincer- ity with power. (pp. 246 Ð 47) This passage adumbrates what I believe are the wider implica- tions of patronage: homosociality, homoerotics, and the con- ßation of the artist and art. Why does Rowland gaze at the group of artists from the outside, as if looking at a painting? Why is it a Ògroup formed by the three menÓ that arouses Row- landÕs interest? Why is Roderick assimilated to a Òbeautiful im- ageÓ? The nexus of concerns underlying these questions is en- capsulated in what I term the ÒPygmalion and Galatea motif.Ó Like Maggie Verver and her father in The Golden Bowl (who, as Martha C. Nussbaum has observed, Òassimilate people, in their imagination and deliberation, to Þne objets d’artÓ),33 Rowland, through his gaze, reiÞes Roderick. Rowland is in effect acquir- ing creations as well as a creator, a person who can produce for him. In this respect, Roderick becomes one of RowlandÕs cre- ations, in the same sense that Christina Light is the product of her motherÕs efforts and a work of art saleable on the marriage market. We are now in a position to appreciate the intricacy of JamesÕs crisscross substitution of art and life. Indeed, Roderick is not only a creator of images but also an image himself, quite literally a tableau vivant. The rhetorical term that describes the metamorphosis from inhuman to human, art to life, inanimate to animate, is prosopopoeia : Òa trope consisting either of the per- soniÞcation of some non-human being or idea, or of the repre- sentation of an imaginary, dead or absent person as alive.Ó 34 An examination of the ways in which prosopopoeia plays itself out in Roderick Hudson reveals a deep connection between aesthetics and homoeroticism. 33 Love’s Knowledge: Essays on Philosophy and Literature (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1990), p. 131. 34 Chris Baldick, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1990), p. 180. </page> <page sequence="17"> 528 nineteenth-century l iterature The most famous instance of prosopopoeia is the myth of Pygmalion and Galatea. According to Book 10 of OvidÕsMeta- morphoses, Pygmalion was a legendary king of Cyprus who fell in love with an ivory statue that he had carved himself. He prayed to Venus that he might have a wife as beautiful as the image he had created, whereupon the goddess caused the statue to come to life. What if PygmalionÕs statue had been not Òa pretty girlÓ but Òa pretty boyÓ (Roderick, p. 177)? Further, is the patron- artist relationship an instance of the creator-creature relation- ship? These two questions strike me as salient, for they allow us to appreciate the ways in which James is working with the mate- rialization of desire and the amalgamation of art and passion. In ÒThe Last of the ValeriiÓ James rehearses prosopopoeia : Count Camillo Valerio becomes infatuated with a beautiful statue of Juno excavated from the grounds of his villa and ne- glects his American wife, Martha. A cynical German archeolo- gist who has come to examine the piece observes: ÒHe keeps her under lock and key, and pays her solitary visits. What does he do, after all? When a beautiful woman is in stone, all he can do is to look at herÓ (ÒLast of the Valerii,Ó p. 812). Later, Martha wails: ÒHis JunoÕs the reality; IÕm the Þction!Ó (p. 822). In ÒThe Story of a YearÓ (1865) the wounded John Ford is vis- ited by Lizzie, and as she sits at his bedside he sees her not as ßesh but as stone: ÒHe lay perfectly motionless, but for his eyes. They wandered over her with a kind of peaceful glee, like sun- beams playing on a statue.Ó35 Inmany of JamesÕs early stories, desiredwomen are watched and compared to statues. In Roderick Hudson loved men are also compared to statues, but whereas women or their sculptural representatives are hidden away, the male statue and its human incarnation can be appreciated in public under the pretext of patronage. When Christina asks Rowland, ÒWhere is that queer friend of yours?Ó (Roderick, p. 275), Rowland tellingly replies: ÒYou mean Mr. Hudson. He is represented by these beautiful works.Ó Similarly, Singleton comments to Rowland: ÒIn my memories of this Roman artist-life, [Roderick] will be the cen- tral Þgure. He will stand there in radiant relief, as beautiful and unspotted as one of his own statues!Ó (p. 439). 35 Henry James, ÒThe Story of a Year,Ó in Complete Stories, 1864 –1874, p. 64. </page> <page sequence="18"> RODERICK HUDSON 529 If the patron-artist relationship represents a socially sanc- tioned homosocial bond, then for Rowland Mallet it moves fur- ther along the sexual continuum and becomes eroticized. In the opening scene of the novel Rowland discusses his dilemma with Cecilia: ÒI am tired of myself, my own thoughts, my own affairs, my own eternal company. True happiness, we are told, consists in getting out of oneÕs self; but the point is not only to get outÑyou must stay out; and to stay out you must have some absorbing errand. Unfortunately, IÕve got no errand, and nobody will trust me with one. I want to care for something, or for some one. And I want to care with a certain ardor; even, if you can believe it, with a cer- tain passion. . . . Do you know I sometimes think that IÕm a man of genius, half-Þnished? The genius has been left out, the faculty of expression is wanting; but the need for expression remains, and I spend my days groping for the latch of a closed door.Ó ÒWhat an immense number of words,Ó said Cecilia after a pause, Òto say you want to fall in love!Ó (p. 171) This exchange elucidates RowlandÕs conßation of two needs:  to express himself and create, and to Þnd an amorous outlet. Acutely perceptive, Cecilia recognizes this conßation immedi- ately, telling Rowland: Òif I refused last night to show you a pretty girl, I can at least show you a pretty boyÓ (p. 177). Of course, the Òpretty boyÓ she presents him with is RoderickÕs statue, ÒThirstÓ (and, by implication, Roderick himself). By suggesting that a live Òpretty girlÓ can be replaced by a statue of a Òpretty boyÓ that later comes to life in the form of Roderick, Cecilia is underscoring her cousinÕs sexual ßuidity and, most importantly, the Pygmalion and Galatea motif at work in the novel. Just as the Church of St. Cecilia is the locale of RowlandÕs Crossing- over of Catholicism and aesthetics, so it is through CeciliaÕs agency that Rowland effects his sexual crossing-over. Like OvidÕs Pygmalion,36 Rowland has Òaccepted the pros- pect of bachelorhoodÓ (Roderick, p. 167), but when he sees Rod- erickÕs statue he is overwhelmed, for Ònothing, in a long time, had given him so much pleasureÓ (p. 178). His reaction is de- 36 See Ovid,Metamorphoses, Books IX–XV, rev. ed., trans. Frank Justus Miller, revised G. P. Goold (Cambridge, Mass: Harvard Univ.

Pygmalion is equally surprised by the pleasure that the sculpture excites in him: ÒPygmalion looks in admira- tion and is inßamed with love for this semblance of a formÓ (Metamorphosis, p. 83). J. Hillis Miller notes: ÒThough the birth of Galatea takes the help of a goddess [Venus], Ovid empha- sizes the way it is the result of human work, even of speciÞcally male work. The work is both sexual and at the same time simply one of manufactureÓ (Versions of Pygmalion, p. 7). RowlandÕs cognomenÑMalletÑis indicative of his role as creator, as a human incarnation of a sculptural tool. Roderick is created by Rowland insofar as he owes his identity as an artist to RowlandÕs patronage: had it not been for Rowland, Roderick would have remained a part-time dilettante with a day job as a lackey for the lawyers Striker and Spooner. RoderickÕs Þrst statue, ÒThirst,Ó is a symbolic rendering of his unquenched de- sire for knowledge and experience. The statue is described in anthropomorphic terms: ÒIts beauty was the beauty of natural movement; nothing had been sought to be represented but the perfection of an attitude. This had been most attentively stud- ied, and it was exquisitely renderedÓ (Roderick, p. 178).37 Seeing the Þgure, Rowland asks Cecilia, ÒIs he [Roderick] a sculptor  by profession?Ó Her responseÑÒHeÕs a law-studentÓÑelicits laughter from Rowland. Rowland in effectmakes Roderick into 37 There are a number of other instances where RoderickÕs life imitates his art. Af- ter he arrives in Europe, he does not pace his imbibing and soon complains of Òan in- digestion of impressionsÓ (Roderick, p. 222). As it did for his dipsomaniac father, who Òdrank himself to deathÓ (p. 184), inebriation also plays a part in RoderickÕs downfall, and Roderick becomes the embodiment of one of his intended but unrealized statues, Òa Bacchus, realistically treated!Ó (p. 362). ÒA Reminiscence,Ó another of RoderickÕs sculptures, is a rendering of a lady whom Roderick met at Baden, Òwho had reminded Rowland of Madame de Cruchecass eÓ and Òwas tremendously statuesqueÓ (p. 258). Madame de Cruchecass e is a character in William Makepeace ThackerayÕs The New- comes (1854), a lady of somewhat damaged reputation. Her name, however, hints at more: Òcruche cass eÓ literally means Òbroken jug,Ó and thus highlights RoderickÕs self- destructiveness, his drunkenness, and his broken ambitions. Similarly, RoderickÕs sculpture of an inebriated lazzarone represents the abyss into which Roderick has sunk. He has drunk life to the lees and, soused by RomeÕs sensuous and sensual delights, cracked his golden bowl. </page> <page sequence="20"> RODERICK HUDSON 531 a professional sculptor, and before RoderickÕs death Rowland tells him so: Òmy affection was always stronger than my re- sentment; . . . I preferred to err on the side of kindness; . . . I had, myself, in a measure, launched you in the worldÓ (p. 500). Though Mrs. Hudson feels like Òthe goose, or the hen, who hatched a swanÕs eggÓ (p. 209), it is Rowland who is responsible for ensuring that the ugly duckling matures into a swan. Mary Garland says as much when, while still in Northampton, she tells Rowland: Òit is like something in a fairy tale. . . . Your com- ing here all unknown, so rich and so polite, and carrying off my cousin in a golden cloudÓ (p. 210). For Rowland Mallet the patron-artist relationship is a sub- limated and socially sanctioned homosocial bond. In The Seduc- tion of the Mediterranean Robert Aldrich explains that until very recent times, homoerotic themes and homosexual longing were often obliged to assume a degree of coding or outright disguise: The situations or images so coded were those in which male nudity, male-bonding or intimate friendships could be presented: . . . places overseas where usual norms of deportment were re- laxed or puritanical mores suspended. Displacement was a way  to bend the rules, to hide ÔdeviantÕ relationships or to excuse misbehaviour.38 Was it because ÒNorthampton is not as gay as RomeÓ (Roderick, p. 304) that Òthe two young men were lounging on the sun- warmed grassÓ (p. 315) in Italy? This scene in chapter 6 in- stances the homosexual coding that Aldrich describes. When Christina and her retinue happen upon ÒMr. Mallet and Mr. Hudson sleeping under a tree,Ó Christina demands of Rod- erick: ÒIs that the way you spend your time? . . . I never yet hap- pened to learn what men were doing when they supposed women were not watching them but it was something vastly  below their reputationÓ (p. 318). Because it also involves cre- ationÑof artworks rather than offspringÑand therefore has the characteristics of a (re)productive heterosexual relation- 38 Robert Aldrich, The Seduction of the Mediterranean: Writing, Art and Homosexual Fantasy (London: Routledge, 1993), p. 7. </page> <page sequence="21"> 532 nineteenth-century l iterature ship, the patron-artist relationship mirrors the man-woman relationship. This interpretation is premised on the primacy of the het- erosexualÑi.e., reproductiveÑrelationship over the homo- sexual one. Although this is admittedly a heterosexist line of ar- gumentation, the novel itself demands such a reading. Thus, I am claiming that the homosexuality inRoderick Hudson is impli- cated in heterosexual norms where male-female relationships constitute the hegemony. Judith Butler, Lee Edelman, and Mi- chael Moon, in other connections and contexts, have argued the reverse, and while I am not contesting their arguments per se, I want to suggest that they cannot be applied as broadly as has been assumed without risking anachronism. In ÒImitation and Gender InsubordinationÓ Butler reconsiders the charge that homosexuals Òare imitations of the heterosexual real,Ó where ÒÔimitationÕ carries the meaning of ÔderivativeÕ or sec- ondary,Õ a copy of an origin which is itself the ground of all copies, but which is itself a copy of nothing.Ó 39 InHomographesis Edelman argues that the gay male is a Òhomograph,Ó someone who simulates the ÒnormalityÓ of masculinity or heterosexuality only to displace them as grounding ontological categories. EdelmanÕs deconstructionist argument proposes that from the vantage point of dominant culture, homosexuality is named Òas a secondary, sterile, and parasitic form of social representationÓ vis-ˆ-vis heterosexual identity.40 Although such reasoning seems acceptable today, these interpretations simply would not have been conceivable, let alone acceptable, to JamesÕs mind or to his mandarin social set in the 1870s. Following FoucaultÕsHistor y of Sexuality (1976 Ð84), Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick demonstrates in her Epistemology of the Closet that distinctions that we now take for granted between gender and sexuality were only beginning to emerge in the last third of the nineteenth century: What was new from the turn of the century was the world- mapping by which every given person, just as he or she was neces- 39 Judith Butler, ÒImitation and Gender Insubordination,Ó in Inside/Out: Lesbian Theories, Gay Theories, ed.

(Epistemology of the Closet, p. 2) Thus, Michael Moon makes a valid contention regarding JamesÕs 1891 story ÒThe PupilÓ: JamesÕs own literary explorations of the circulation of ÒperverseÓ desires are elaborate and searching, and remarkably uncon- strained by contemporary standards of gentility and prudery. . . . if James were writing today, his work would look more like [David LynchÕs 1986 Þlm] Blue Velvet than it would like [Þlm producers Ismail] Merchant and [ James] IvoryÕs ponderously reverent pe- riod ÒrecreationsÓ of his novels. (ÒA Small Boy and Others,Ó p. 149) While MoonÕs argument is enticing, it cannot be extended to the entire Jamesian corpus. Although homoerotic elements are patent and latent in the early stories and inRoderick Hudson, James was not yet ready to be as Òremarkably unconstrainedÓ  as he later would be. As a result, the novel resorts to queer cod- ing and attempts to camoußage the same-sex relationship. In recent years there has been a considerable critical effort to ÒqueerÓ James, but even though much of the insights afforded into JamesÕs sexuality are interesting, we should not lose sight of the fact that his sexual persona (as subdued as it may have been) evolved considerably, and that the sexuality espoused  in the early works need not be reßective of that of the later works.41 In short, I want to guard against readings that conßate and confuse the early and the late James. The very presence of the homoerotic topos should never- theless alert us to the fact that James was attempting (albeit cautiously) a rupture with the moralism of Ralph Waldo Emer- 41 InHenry James andSexuality Stevens notes the critical and biographical tendency to mistakenly assume that ÒJamesÕs supposed abstinence from any form of sexual activity make[s] him an unlikely author of Þction which self-consciously represents same-sex desire betweenmenÓ (p. x).

According to Aldrich, Pater, in tak- ing up Johann Joachim WinckelmannÕs arguments and vaunt- ing the beauty and sensuality of classical statues, Òsuggested a new aesthetics, openly sensual and erotic, which by implication should be free of the straitened morality of traditional cultural and religious beliefsÓ (Seduction of the Mediterranean, p. 76). James commented on PaterÕs book in a letter to William James dated 31 May 1873: ÒI see it treats of several things I know nothing aboutÓ (Letters, I, 391).

Likewise, Madame GrandoniÕs allegory of the failed German painter, Herr Schafgans, is not only Òa warning against high- ßown pretensionsÓ (p. 245) but also against wily women. His name foreshadows his fate, since Mr. ÒSheep-gooseÓ (Schaf- Gans) is a silly goose who marries Òa buxom, bold-faced, high- colored creatureÓ who Òused to beat himÓ (pp. 245Ð 46). With- out a Òsheep-dogÓ to watch out for him, the sheep is devoured by the she-wolf. But Rowland is not as disinterested and innoc- uous as he pretends to be: he is clearly interested in Roderick and in keeping him for himself. Rowland wants to tell Christina Òwithout delayÓ that Roderick is Ònot at liberty to become in- deÞnitely interested in other women,Ó and when Roderick protests, Rowland reminds him: ÒI am the cause of your separa- tion from Miss Garland, the cause of your being exposed to temptations which she hardly even suspectsÓ (p. 308). When things fall apart and Roderick is no longer pro- ducing anything of value, Rowland meets Christina Light in the Church of St. Cecilia and she accuses him of not being Òcon- tentedÓ: ÒTo begin with, you are in love. . . . And it doesnÕt go well. There are grievous obstaclesÓ (p. 349). If Christina is al- luding to RowlandÕs putative love for Mary Garland, then Rod- erick later reveals one of the Ògrievous obstacles,Ó telling Row- land: Òthere are certain things you know nothing about. . . . women, principally, and what relates to women. Women for </page> <page sequence="26"> RODERICK HUDSON 537 you, by what I can make out, mean nothingÓ (p. 497). Chris- tinaÕs comment alludes to RowlandÕs obstructed affections for Roderick, and RowlandÕs supposed love for Mary Garland is a smoke screen for the Mallet-Hudson homoerotics. In this respect, I read the relationship between Roderick, Mary, and Rowland as an instancing of Ren  GirardÕs notion of ÒÔtriangularÕ desire.Ó 47 A straight line joins the subject and ob- ject, Rowland and Roderick; Mary is the Òmediator,Ó Òabove that line, radiating toward both the subject and the objectÓ (De- ceit, p. 2). Like the nude woman in the foreground of ƒdouard ManetÕsLe Déjeuner sur l’herbe (1863), who diverts the viewerÕs at- tention from the implicit homoerotics between the two clothed men, MaryÕs role is to create a diversion from the novelÕs same- sex relationship. James acknowledged as much in his preface to the novel: The ironic effect of [RowlandÕs] having fallen in love with the girl who is herself in love with Roderick, . . . the conception of this last irony, I must add, has remained happier than my execu- tion of it. . . . . . . Mary GarlandÕs way doesnÕt, indubitably, convince us; any more than we are truly convinced, I think, that RowlandÕs des- tiny, or say his nature, would have made him accessible at the same hour to two quite distinct commotions, each a very deep one, of his whole personal economy. (ÒPreface,Ó pp. xviiiÐxix) When Rowland, imitating RoderickÕs amorous actions at the Coliseum with Christina, climbs to dangerous heights to pick a ßower forMiss Garland, she ÒgravelyÓ asks him, ÒWhy did you do that?Ó His response shows these ÒcommotionsÓ: ÒHe hesitated. He felt that it was physically possible to say, ÔBecause I love you!Õ but that it was not morally possible. He lowered his pitch and answered, simply, ÔBecause I wanted to do something for youÕÓ (p. 473). Rowland cannot tell Mary he loves her because it is morally reprehensible to lie, and his affections lie with Roderick. This passage also elucidates the way in which Row- 47 See Girard, Deceit, Desire, and the Novel: Self and Other in Literary Structure, trans. Yvonne Freccero (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ.

Rowland equates unselÞshness and usefulness with demonstrating love. In the scene in which Rowland sees RoderickÕs corpse, the narrator tells us: ÒNow that it was over, Rowland understood how exclusively, for two years, Roderick had Þlled his life. His occupation was goneÓ (Roderick, p. 511). James used the same phrase in other works, both before and after Roderick Hudson. InWatch and Ward (1871), during NoraÕs two-year absence early in the novel, the narrator says: ÒRoger found that he missed her sadly; his occupation was gone.Ó 48 And in the Þnal chapter of The American, after Christopher Newman has loved and lost Claire de Cintr , the narrator says: ÒHe had nothing to do, his occupation was goneÓ (The American, p. 865). The phrase, rem- iniscent of OthelloÕs when he believes he has lost Desdemona (ÒOthelloÕs occupationÕs goneÓ),49 was one of JamesÕs favorites. In Roderick Hudson it indicates both that Rowland no longer has anyone to take care of and that his occupation, in the sense of habitation and tenancy, is over: he can live neither vicariously through Roderick, nor with him. My reading of ÒoccupationÓ as both Òvocation/professionÓ and Òtenancy/homeÓ is substantiated in chapter 2, when Mary Garland tells Rowland: Òyou are unlike other men. . . . You have no duties, no profession, no homeÓ (Roderick, p. 217). By becoming RoderickÕs patron, Rowland Þnds an occupation, a profession, and a home, and RoderickÕs artistic community effectively becomes RowlandÕs as well. The opening of chapter 6 conÞrms this reading: One day, on entering RoderickÕs lodging . . . , Rowland found a letter on the table addressed to himself. It was from Roderick, and consisted of but three lines: ÒI am gone to FrascatiÑfor med- itation. If I am not at home on Friday, you had better join me.Ó On Friday he was still absent, and Rowland went out to Frascati.

Clearly, these actions indicate that Rowland feels that both Roderick and his home are equally his, by virtue of the contractual nature of the patron-artist relationship. Roderick is also RowlandÕs symbolic Òhome,Ó for it is with him that Rowland feels most at home. RoderickÕs home is where RowlandÕs heart is, and his strange sense of loss can therefore be attributed to the ÒunhomingÓ that RoderickÕs death pro- vokes. In ÒThe ÔUncannyÕÓ Freud maintains that being un- homed is unheimlich. The resemblance between Heim (home) and unheimlich (uncanny) reinforces this sense. For Freud the unheimlich is the name for Òsomething which ought to have re- mained hidden but has come to lightÓ; to be unhomed is to ex- pose oneselfÑwhether consciously or not, voluntarily or notÑ to the mysterious, the scary secret: Òthis uncanny is in reality nothing new or alien, but something which is familiar and old- established in the mind and which has become alienated from it only through the process of repressionÓ (ÒThe ÔUncanny,ÕÓ p. 241). Roderick is watched and objectiÞed even in death: when Rowland discovers RoderickÕs corpse, Òthe thing that yes- terday was his friend,Ó he watches over it Òfor seven long hours, and his vigil was forever memorableÓ (Roderick, pp. 509 Ð10). Rowland gives himself over to emotion (what Roderick had termed Ònecessary folliesÓ), and Òthe most rational of men was for an hour the most passionateÓ (p. 510). The novelÕs ending conÞrms that RoderickÕs inßuence on Rowland was not only aesthetic. The degree to which their lives were intertwined is manifest in RowlandÕs death-wish: Òhe would have lain down there in RoderickÕs placeÓ (p. 510). FreudÕs thesis in ÒMourning and MelancholiaÓ (1917) is that the bereavedÕs response to the loss of a beloved can be Òto establish an identication of the ego with the abandoned ob- ject.Ó 50 Yet the bereaved personÕs attempt to incorporate his lost love into his own identity also carries him Òback to the stage of sadismÓ and is manifested by a Òtendency to suicideÓ (ÒMourn- ing,Ó p. 252). I believe that this theory can explain RowlandÕs reaction and his cryptic last line: ÒCecilia . . . calls him [Row- land], whenever he reappears, the most restless of mortals. But 50 Sigmund Freud, ÒMourning and Melancholia,Ó in Standard Edition, XIV, 249. </page> <page sequence="29"> 540 nineteenth-century l iterature he always says to her in answer, ÔNo, I assure you I am the most patient!ÕÓ (Roderick, p. 511). Although this excerpt has been read as indicative of RowlandÕs undying love for Mary Garland, I think that when we bring FreudÕs commentary to bear on the passage, it can also be understood as signaling RowlandÕs un- dying love for Roderick: his restlessness is like a death-wish, a desire to be reunited with Roderick in death. Whereas Mary Garland was, in GirardÕs idiom, a ÒmediatorÓ in the Rowland- Mary-Roderick triangle of desire, after RoderickÕs death she becomes a medium, because Rowland maintains his connec- tion to Roderick through her. This explains why Cecilia has the Òshrewd impressionÓ that Rowland has an ulterior motive when Òhe comes to see Miss GarlandÓ (p. 511). It also suggests that while Mary GarlandÕs Òloud, tremendous cry, upon the sense- less vestige of her love. . . . still lives in RowlandÕs earsÓ (p. 511), Roderick, through her agency, still lives in his eyes as well. In a 1920 unpublished fragment entitled ÒOn Love and Related Matters,Ó Walter Benjamin correlates patience, sight, and sexuality: As we peer into the darkness of the transformations taking place in that great ßowing stream of human physicality, our sight fails as we contemplate a future for which it has perhaps been de- termined that though no prophet shall pierce its veil, it may be won by the most patient man.51 Similarly, patience and sight for Rowland means both pleasure and pain. Yet his sight has not failed him, for it has given him the opportunity to lift the veil that shrouded his psyche. In the novelÕs Þrst chapter Rowland is described as Òforever looking in vain for the uses of the things that please and the charm of the things that sustainÓ (Roderick, p. 177), yet at the novelÕs close one has the sense that, despite the immediate tragedy of RoderickÕs death, Rowland has not looked in vain. Through patronage and the right to sight that it confers, Rowland has discovered that pleasant things, such as art and homosociality, can be useful be- 51 Walter Benjamin, ÒOn Love and Related Matters (A European Problem),Ó trans.

Rowland Þnds in Roderick and in the objects of aestheticized Catholicism what he was looking for, and, by extension, looking at them provides him with psy- chological sustenance. In this sense Roderick personiÞes Òthe charm of the things that sustainÓ (p. 177), for he elicits in Row- land Òa mingled sense of his personal charm and his artistic ca- pacityÓ (p. 186). Like his statuette of the water-drinker, Roder- ick has given Rowland Òextreme pleasureÓ and elucidated for him Òthe uses of the things that pleaseÓ (p. 177). If we look be- yond the melodramatics of the Þnal chapter, we can see that at the novelÕs core there is a realization of the inÞnite intricacies of both life and its artistic incarnations. Rowland has loved and lost, but he has also lost and found. The lesson of art is, for Rowland Mallet, as complex and bittersweet as life itself. He has lost a friend, but he has found that patronage, because it per- mits and promotes aesthetics and homosociality, can be a route into himself. In this respect, Roderick Hudson conÞrms that, in- deed, Òit is art thatmakes life.Ó Cambridge University </page> </plain_text>
