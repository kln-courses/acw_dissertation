<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Philological Endeavours of the Early Arabic Linguists: Theological Implications of the tawqlf-istildh Antithesis and the majdz Controversy (Part II) Mustafa Shah SOAS, UNIVERSITY OF LONDON In his discerning study of the haqiqa-majdz dichotomy Heinrichs observed that the seemingly natural opposition between these two terms was not always the case.1 Moreover, he showed that the technical meaning of the term majdz revealed that it had endured a distinct evolution of its own; its significance was further governed by whether it was used in linguistic or theological contexts. Heinrichs' research of this topic granted particular importance to the incisive observations of Ibn Taymiyya (661-728/1263-1328) in his Kitab al-imdn.2 The focus of Ibn Taymiyya's study was the appropriateness of dividing speech on a literal contra non-literal axis, the corol lary of which was an antithesis in the way words were understood. Ibn Taymiyya took the view that the division of speech on this basis represented an insidious attempt to undermine the literal language of scripture and thereby pursue a pre conceived theological bent. Ibn Taymiyya therefore set out to place the concept of majdz within an elaborate framework, showing from an historical perspective that the term majdz could not be linked to a developed conception of metaphor or figurative language. However, in order to achieve such an objective Ibn Taymiyya had to dispel the 'myth' that a developed notion of majdz was pre-eminently accepted by the earliest generations of scholars. Furthermore, he had to disprove that it was an irrefutable feature of the Arabic language, criticising the theoretical apparatus used to buttress its relevance to language. It was in these contexts that the doctrines asso ciated with the revelationist nature of language's origin (tawqif al-lugha), the con ventionalist perspective (istildh), and the concept of majdz were destined to cross paths. It was Ibn Taymiyya who astutely linked the three motifs, although ultimately he had to sacrifice the concept of tawqif al-lugha. Ibn Taymiyya reported that the work of Abu cUbayda Macmar ibn al-Muthanna (d. 215/815), entitled Majdz al-Qur'an, was the first text to employ the term majdz. Taking this finding into consideration, Heinrichs examined a number of contempo</page><page sequence="2">44 Journal of Qur'anic Studies rary attempts to gauge the development and nature of the phenomenon of majdz and its application, particularly in the work of Abu cUbayda. Heinrichs was generally dis missive of Wansbrough's remarks which suggested that the term was indicative of a form of textual restoration (taqdlr) employed by linguists to 'alleviate the strictures imposed upon the language by Qur'anic diction'.3 Heinrichs also considered a further study of the technical meaning of majdz in the work of Abu cUbayda by Almagor. He concluded that her suggestion that the term majdz was used by linguists simply to denote a mode of expression required further qualification as it did not encompass the full technical extent of majdz.4 Heinrichs presented his own synthesis of the his torical significance of this term, maintaining that the term majdz was originally part of the technical vocabulary of the earliest linguists and that it was invoked to indi cate what he describes as a form of explanatory rewriting of phrases: an instrument of grammatical resolution. Heinrichs also asserted that this 'rewriting' might inci dentally include transient references to figurative language; however, this was not its exclusive function.5 Moreover, Heinrichs reported that although the term majdz was synonymous with the frequently adduced phrases macnd and tafsir, it was specific to issues of linguistic interpretation along with the idiomatic use of certain words and constructions.6 Having shown that the primitive form of majdz was commensurate with a specific linguistic function and that it was a term found in the nomenclature of the early Arabic linguists, Heinrichs examined the factors which brought about the seemingly spontaneous opposition between the terms haqiqa and majdz. He noted that the provenance of the term haqiqa betrayed a theological character. Indeed, Heinrichs dis covered that this term was germane to specific ontological discussions. He believed that the significance of the term majdz and its eventual pairing in opposition with haqiqa could be attributed to the fact that theologians such as the early Muctazilites required a theological instrument to nullify the anthropomorphic imagery of a literal interpretation of scripture. Previously, the linguists had employed majdz to demon strate that the language of the Qur'an could be subjected to explanatory rewriting, showing that the language of scripture was consistent with the idiomatic idiosyn crasies of the Arabs.7 Heinrichs argued that as the variation in the application of these terms crystallised, haqiqa was 'wrested from its ontological moorings' and came to denote the literal use of a word or construction, whilst majdz ultimately assumed a figurative connotation.8 Heinrichs adds that even in the work of Ibn Qutayba (d. 276/889), Ta'wil mushkil al-Qur'an, in which the phenomenon of majdz is exem plified through reference to the Qur'an, the opposition between haqiqa and majdz was not quite developed, although his work did combine the linguistic and theological properties of majdz.9 Meanwhile, the efforts of the Muctazilites had meant that 'the compass of majdz had shrunk to metaphor and figurative usage', and the progression</page><page sequence="3">The Philological Endeavours of the Early Arabic Linguists 45 to an opposition with haqlqa ensued inexorably.10 Heinrichs declared that the clas sical theory of majdz encompassed all forms of metaphorical speech and idioms and thus in many ways the distinct contributions of linguists and theologians had been effectively assimilated. He reported that the aesthetic character of this literary theory was brought to fruition in the works of cAbd al-Qahir al-Jurjani (d. 471/1078).11 However, one should note that amongst those who accepted majdz as a genuine fea ture of carabiyya, there was disagreement concerning aspects of its relevance and interpretation. Ibn Faris (d. 395/1004-5) introduces haqlqa and majdz as antithetical features and he proceeds to offer definitions of their linguistic features. One aspect of majdz to which he refers states that the Arabs' speech comprised expressions which conflicted with their apparent meaning; however, he voices criticisms of Ibn Qutayba for extending a similar principle to a particular type of Qur'anic expression. Thus, one certainly detects a lingering tension in this area of scholarship.12 The theoretical justification employed to underpin the developed concept of majdz was incidental to the principal controversy over whether scripture and religious doc trines should be interpreted through a veneer of metaphorical language. The perspec tives on the concept of the revelationist origin of language (tawqlf al-lugha) and the opposing conventionalist (istildh) position were assiduously imported into the dis cussions. According to Ibn Taymiyya, one aspect of the argument here was that when ever the proponents of majdz were asked to provide authority for their theoretical defence of the feature of majdz, they might respond by invoking the hypothesis con cerning the conventionalist origin of language (istildh). It was suggested that sepa rate stages of assigning meanings to words had predicated that a single word could have more than one meaning and hence this justified the introduction of a figurative bias in the way that words might be interpreted. These linguistic processes seemingly furnished a single word with two possible semantic dimensions: one was haqlqa (lit eral), and the other was majdz (metaphorical). Notwithstanding the fact that there had to be an apparent connection between the literal and metaphorical meanings of a given word, otherwise one would be speaking of two distinctly separate words. Indeed, we have noted previously the arguments cited by linguists to justify homonyms in the idiom of Arabic.13 Furthermore, the proponents of majdz would argue that a contex tual clue would always be present to allow one to identify the majdz expression. A typical form of argument presented in this respect maintained that the haqlqa expres sion reflected the use of a given word in accordance with the primordial purpose of wadc (the process of assigning meanings to words); Ibn Taymiyya provides the exam ple of the words 'lion' and 'ass' which would be haqlqa if used to denote actual ani mals. Conversely, the majdz word is theoretically seen as emanating from a second ary cycle of wad\ and is thereby derived conventionally. Ex hypothesi, it represent ed a word whose application did not reflect its primordial assignment. Taking the</page><page sequence="4">46 Journal of Qur'anic Studies examples of the words 'lion' and 'ass', in a majdz context these would be used to denote bravery or stupidity respectively.14 It is suggested that their meaning has been transferred from a primary meaning to a secondary one. On the linguistic plane the reasoning appears quite innocuous; but on the theological and legal plane the impli cations are quite critical. This was the rationale used to explain linguistically the ori gin of the haqiqa-majdz opposition: the former denoted literal language and the lat ter symbolised a metaphorical dimension of language. It would appear obvious that the best way of countering the theory that the process es of istildh were responsible for the stock of haqiqa-majdz words was to appeal to the concept of tawqif al-lugha. However, the philological endeavours of the linguists had shown that the revelationist doctrine was rather fluid and subject to a plethora of interpretation, despite the fact that linguists endorsed it as a sacrosanct doctrine. Moreover, it was possible for the proponents of majdz to accept the general tenor of the revelationist nature of language's origin, claiming that it could also be used to substantiate a theoretical basis for the concept of majdz:15 Ibn Jinni (d. 392/1002) and Abu CAH al-Farisi (d. 377/987) endorsed the concept of tawqif al-lugha and yet also vociferously defended the incidence of majdz in the language of scripture. It is with in these contexts that one finds Ibn Taymiyya's references to the concept of tawqif al-lugha, although Heinrichs did not refer to this fact. Weiss did present an overview of the links between these themes in his later commentary on al-Amidi's work on the principles of jurisprudence. His former article was concerned principally with study ing the development of tawqif al-lugha as a doctrine; the distinct link with majdz was not examined. Ibn Taymiyya appreciated that given the aforementioned argu ments, the perceived doctrine of tawqif al-lugha would require subtle qualification. Indeed, an examination of Ibn Taymiyya's writing on this subject along with the array of arguments which he adduces in this respect shows that the theoretical justi fication for the division of speech into haqiqa and majdz was shifting. It was these subtle shifts which precipitated a re-examination of the concept of tawqif al-lugha on the part of Ibn Taymiyya as he endeavoured to untangle the profusion of theoretical complexities used to justify the resort to metaphor and figurative expressions in inter preting the diction of scripture. Ibn Taymiyya's condemnation of the developed concept of majdz along with the the ories which were adduced to underpin its merits was outlined in two separate areas of his writing. The first of these is included in his collection of legal and religious edicts and forms part of an introduction to the principles of jurisprudence; the sec ond, also comprised in this legal collection and published separately as a monograph, represented an extended apology for the rudiments of faith (imdn) and was designed to impugn Ashcarite, Muctazilite, Murji'ite, and Jahmite expositions of the doctrines of faith. His foray into this area follows a statement asking whether imdn (faith) was</page><page sequence="5">The Philological Endeavours of the Early Arabic Linguists 47 contingent upon (good) works in a haqlqa sense, as opposed to a majdz sense.16 Ibn Taymiyya fears that such a doctrine would seriously impinge upon the intensely inte gral relationship between faith and practice. But it was also the case that Ibn Taymiyya was keen to repudiate those theologians whose doctrinal statements were formulated through a profusion of references to metaphor. However, such theologians would claim that they were merely emphasising the transcendent nature of God and His attributes and their resort to the concept of majdz helped them achieve this aim. It is intriguing to observe that Ibn Taymiyya was acutely aware of the rather convo luted history of the concept of majdz. He makes the telling observation that a divi sion of words, or indeed the meanings they denoted, into veridical and tropical cate gories, whatever the terminology one resorted to, reflected a posterior development. It could not be connected with the pious ancestors.17 Ibn Taymiyya had reported that the first figure to promulgate innovatively the conventionalist (istildh) perspective was the Muctazilite Abu Hashim (d. 321/933), the son of the eminent al-Jubba'I (d. 303/915).18 He argues that neither the early jurists nor the first linguists had proffered a view on this topic: al-Shafici (d. 204/820) had not proposed such a division of speech nor had the Hanafite jurist Muhammad al-Shaybani (d. 189/808). Ibn Taymiyya asserts that the first instance of this term's usage had no theological sig nificance; it was used to highlight a linguistic function in the exegetical-grammati cal treatise of Abu cUbayda. Moreover, Ibn Taymiyya argues that the theological dimension of the developed concept of majdz was insidiously contrived by the Muctazilites or those with a propensity for dialectics. In Ibn Taymiyya's estimation these developments were innovative in a rather pejorative way. He also alludes to the fact that the proponents of majdz adduced statements claiming that the pious ances tors had seemingly invoked the mechanism of the phenomenon of majdz. He men tions statements attributed to Ahmad ibn Hanbal (164-241/780-855) from the lat ter's work entitled al-Radd cald 'l-jahmiyya way l-zanddiqa in which he employs the term majdz.19 He suggests that Ibn Hanbal's reference to the term majdz was expressed in order to exemplify certain synecdochial features of speech. It was imper ative to note that there was nothing inauspicious in Ibn Hanbal's use of this term because it had a strictly linguistic connotation. And it was disingenuous to imply that this paragon of orthodoxy had accepted the developed theory of majdz with all its theological trappings and used it in the exposition of faith. Extending the array of arguments, Ibn Taymiyya had succeeded in firmly placing distance between the pious ancestors and a developed conception of majdz which encompassed allusions to figurative language. Ibn Taymiyya uses his introduction to usul al-fiqh to approach the issue of the acceptance of a theory of majdz in the works of the jurists. Interestingly, he selects the epistemological preliminaries of Sayf al-Din al-Amidi (d. 630/1233) outlined in</page><page sequence="6">48 Journal of Qur'anic Studies the latter's al-Ihkdm fi usul al-ahkdm in order to instigate a thoroughly meticulous refutation of the relevance of majdz in legal discussions.20 The same stock of argu ments from his Kitab al-imdn is carefully adduced. Al-Amidi's treatise had intro duced the developed concept of majdz as an axiom of language.21 Here the concern of Ibn Taymiyya was that the majority of jurists were accentuating the developed con cept of majdz in which a literal-metaphorical context to language is applied in the textual analysis of scripture. Having quoted al-Amidi's opening remarks regarding the relative consensus of the scholars of usul who endorse resolutely the incidence of majdz in the language of the Arabs, Ibn Taymiyya seeks to appeal to the appropriate religious authority for his position within the field of jurisprudence. He suggests that it was anachronistic to insinuate that the developed concept of majdz was approved by the earliest generation of scholars. Indeed, he argues that the pioneering masters of fiqh such as al-Shafici and other figures of his calibre had neither recognised nor proffered a view on the phenomenon of majdz. Furthermore, reiterating the arguments expressed in the discourse on imdn, he emphasises that the division of speech into haqiqa and majdz is a postulate found in the compositions of the Muctazilites, pro ponents of dialectics, and jurists who favoured emulating the methodology of the speculative theologians. Ibn Taymiyya retorts that none of these aforementioned groups could be considered authorities in tafsir, hadith, fiqh, lugha, and nahw, adding that renowned linguists such as al-Khalll (d. 175/791), Sibawayhi (d. 183/799), al-Kisa'I (d. 189/808), al-Farra' (d. 207/822), and other prominent philol ogists and grammarians had not offered this classification of speech (i.e. its division into veridical contra tropical).22 He is keen to denounce the posterior concept of majdz from all perspectives, emphasising the lack of scholarly authority for such a hypothesis of language. Ibn Taymiyya then moves on to recount that the grammari ans had astutely contrived a technical vocabulary previously unknown to the Arabs, introducing grammatical terminology such as/&lt;zc//, maful, and masdar, yet there was nothing sinister in the wholly descriptive nature of these linguistic categories: the linguists had prudently sought to qualify the characteristics of the Arabs' language; however, the use of the terms haqiqa and majdz could not be viewed in the same vein: it did not proceed naturally from a descriptive approach to the language of the Arabs; it was an invidious division created by theologians keen to pursue sectarian objectives.23 Ibn Taymiyya dismisses the fact that a number of Hanbalites like Abu Yacla (d. 457/1066) and Ibn cAqil (431-512/1040-1119) had espoused the developed theory of majdz, believing that Ibn Hanbal had spoken of the feature of majdz. These figures had misconstrued Ibn Hanbal's references to the phrase majdz and its seman tic value in the technical vocabulary of the formative years of Islam; it was neither a reference to metaphor nor an allusion to figurative language.24 The Shaficite jurist Abu Ishaq al-Isfara'ini (d. 417/1027) is recalled by both Ibn</page><page sequence="7">The Philological Endeavours of the Early Arabic Linguists 49 Taymiyya and Sayf al-Din al-Amidi as a scholar who was the principal opponent of the theory of majdz, bitterly disputing its relevance. Nevertheless, Abu Ishaq had endorsed a doctrine of tawqif which fused the revelationist and conventionalist agents in the origin of language, as Weiss points out.25 He argued that a measure of tawqif provided the foundation upon which istildh was instituted.26 This appears commen surate with Weiss's suggestion that tawqif al-lugha had lost its raison d'etre, given the doctrinal revision propounded by the Ashcarites on the nature of God's speech. However, it presumably confirms that the concept of tawqif al-lugha was not capa ble of expressly countering the theoretical justification of the concept of majdz, which thrived on the notion of successive waves of positing. In his Kitab al-imdn Ibn Taymiyya reports that a group of scholars rejected the notion that language in gener al, or indeed the language of the Qur'an, comprised majdz expressions. Moreover, Abu Ishaq was prominent in this respect, and the issue was not one of terminology as hinted by his opponents.27 Ibn Taymiyya informs us that his detractors argued that if Abu Ishaq were to accept that there existed a selection of words whose usage did not correspond with primordial wadc, and that the meanings of these words were highlighted by the presence of a contextual clue, then he has implicitly acknowledged majdz. Ibn Taymiyya then states that a rebuttal of this argument was outlined by the supporters of Abu Ishaq, exploiting the theoretical arguments presented to justify majdz. It asserted that the haqiqa expression reflected the use of a given word in accordance with the primordial purpose of its wadc: the literal use of an expression; conversely, the majdz expression was its opposite, an expression used for something other than its primordial purpose, although a contextual clue would elucidate the majdz expression.28 This necessitates that a word be primarily assigned with a spe cific meaning for which it might be used; or that it might be used for a non-primor dial purpose. This, in the view of the supporters of Abu Ishaq, creates a problem because it would mean that a lafz (expression) which was majdz required a preceding haqiqa; however, an expression which was haqiqa did not require a majdz. Moreover, Abu Ishaq's supporters added that subsequent figures who were advocates of the phenomenon of majdz were aware of what seemed a flaw in such reasoning and they reviewed their predecessors' definitions, stating that prior to being used, a con ceived expression (al-lafz al-mawduc) is neither haqiqa nor majdz: once it is used for a non-primordial purpose it becomes majdz and has no need of a preceding haqiqa.29 Having ruminated over the various forms of theoretical defence offered by those who believed that a concept of majdz was indispensable in both the fields of law and the ology, Ibn Taymiyya sets out to adjust systematically the doctrine of tawqif al lugha. He admits that theoretical propositions discussed by the supporters of majdz were acceptable if it were possible to disentangle the intricate nature of wadc, partic ularly in terms of an arbitrary scheme of muwddaca preceding the actual application</page><page sequence="8">50 Journal of Qur'anic Studies of words. Furthermore, this position presupposes istildh, i.e. a coterie of intelligent people gathered and conventionally assigned meanings to words, and this had occurred in all languages.30 Moreover, these words and meanings were employed in secondary contexts. It is at this juncture that Ibn Taymiyya claims that this view was not known prior to the endeavours of the son of al-Jubba'i, Abu Hashim, who, in the late third/ninth century, first promulgated the thesis of istildh in distinct opposition to tawqif al-lugha; and that he was opposed by Abu '1-Hasan al-Ashcari (260 324/873-935). Indeed, having dismissed the possibility of one's discerning the profundities of wad\ Ibn Taymiyya had effectively relinquished the doctrine of tawqif al-lugha. He was therefore able to proceed with the argument that istildh was an insidious contrivance, a tool introduced for the specific purpose of supporting the concept of majdz. His reluctance to endorse a rigid interpretation of the doctrine of tawqif al-lugha allows him to repudiate a second view which suggested that words were designated majdz and haqiqa by the Almighty at the primordial moment of language's inception.31 It was Ibn Taymiyya's view that the only constant in this sea of uncertainties was the factor of usage (isticmdl); indeed, this had to govern the whole approach to under standing language and scripture. Ibn Taymiyya does not wholly reject all aspects of tawqif al-lugha. He introduces the agent of ilhdm as a means of accommodating a divine role in the origin of language. It is described as a visceral quality bestowed by the Almighty to facilitate the acquisition of language. This explained why children were able to acquire the rudiments of language during the formative years of their childhood. Although there would be times when a child might seek clarification regarding the convention of meanings and usage, he or she possessed an innate qual ity which acted as a catalyst in their acquisition of language. It was also the case that a person wishing to communicate in a language with which he or she is not familiar may seek the assistance of a translator who would then convey the relevant meanings; however, it is possible for the same person to attain a level of proficiency in a target language through fraternising and without the aid of a tutor. Ibn Taymiyya finds an altogether confined role for istildh: he states that it was restricted to the naming of a city, a book, or a newly devised mechanical contraption; nevertheless, he summarily asserts that such processes could not account for the bulk of language.32 The principal theme which permeates the arguments of Ibn Taymiyya is the authority of linguistic usage (isti'mdl). It takes on the status of an all-pervading sunna which is applied when attempting to gauge the idiom of scripture. According to Ibn Taymiyya, the doctrine of tawqif al-lugha as a linear phenomenon passed from generation to gen eration since the time of Adam, through the period of the great flood, and then to the advent of Islam, was simply self-contradictory and could not be substantiated. Conversely, to maintain that active processes of wadc actually precede isticmdl was</page><page sequence="9">The Philological Endeavours of the Early Arabic Linguists 51 equally fallacious. This leaves the agent of ilhdm as the only plausible factor which could explain the capacity to articulate language: Tf one wishes to call this tawqif, then let him do so.'33 That majdz theoretically presupposes deliberate stages of wadc, and ultimately presages a figurative understanding of language, dictated that a selec tion of phrases which could only be interpreted in a haqiqa sense required further qual ification. Of course, one could dispense with this if linguistic usage were endorsed as the authoritative criterion in the interpretation of language, as argued by Ibn Taymiyya. Proponents of the haqiqa-majdz division of language were compelled to introduce three further categories of words designated as veridical (haqiqa): i) haqiqa lughawiyya; ii) haqiqa sharciyya; and iii) haqiqa curfiyya.34 The first class of words represented the core of language, emanating from the inception of lugha\ the second class of words comprised terms which had taken on new significance with the advent of Islam, particularly words such as zakdt, hajj, saldt, and sawm, for it was impera tive that theologically sensitive words be removed from the sphere of majdz (theoret ically, it was implicit that these words emanated from a secondary cycle of wadc and hence technically they were majdz but it was obvious that they could not be interpreted figuratively); the third class of words included terms whose meaning had been rela tively modified through idiosyncratic usage to the degree that the previous meaning had been seemingly superseded. The technical vocabulary of the grammarians was an excellent example of this last category. According to Ibn Taymiyya, all of these inde terminate categories were inevitable by-products of the haqiqa-majdz dichotomy. He adds that when the Qur'an spoke of zakdt, hajj, saldt, and sawm, the meanings and religious significance were plainly obvious to speakers of the Arabic language. The cri terion of usage therefore rendered all such divisions futile. Moreover, he concludes that the tripartite division of the haqiqa word was introduced to rationalise a number of anomalies created by a theory of majdz.35 One particular argument which features prominently in Ibn Taymiyya's discussion of majdz relates to the propositions of his opponents that the majdz (tropical) expres sion is distinguished by the specific presence of a contextual clue (qarina). And, con versely, an expression which is haqiqa (veridical) will have no contextual clue: it was semantically self-sufficient. Ibn Taymiyya devotes a considerable amount of effort to the issue of context, both in his discourse on imdn and in his introduction to the principles of law.36 He rejects such propositions through an intricate web of argu ments, asserting that context was an intractable feature of all speech: it was not pos sible to isolate speech from general contexts on both the grammatical and semantic levels. By implication Ibn Taymiyya had ruled that the boundaries of the so-called opposition between haqiqa and majdz were far too arbitrary. It was safer to use isticmdl in gauging the language of the Arabs. Ibn Taymiyya focuses on specific Qur'anic verses alleged to exemplify the incidence of majdz in the Arabic language</page><page sequence="10">52 Journal of Qur'anic Studies to illustrate the point. Seeking proof for his arguments, he refers to the three verses commonly adduced in the treatises of the jurists, exegetes, and grammarians as axioms of the majdz expression: Q.12:82; Q.18:77; and Q.16:112. It is implied that the context supposedly paves the way for a tropical (majdz) rendition in the exegesis of these verses.37 Thus in the first verse, 'Ask (the inhabitants of) the village', the term qariya (village) encompasses its inhabitants, and, argues Ibn Taymiyya, the term is used throughout the Qur'an for the same express purpose unless the contexts dictate otherwise. He explains that although animate behaviour is attributed to or expected of inanimate matter (a village), this should not be construed as an indicator of majdz or indeed hadhf (ellipsis) and taqdir (suppletion). Similar arguments could be extended to the other verses. Ibn Taymiyya asserts that when the Qur'an (18:77) speaks of 'a wall wanting to fall' (translated by Arberry as 'a wall about to tumble down'), it was wrong to infer that such an expression was majdz on the basis that a wall is not animate and that 'want' or 'will' is an attribute of animate beings.38 He then suggests that 'inclination' and, moreover, the 'will' that accompanies 'inclina tion' can be applied to animate beings and inanimate matter. Moreover, he goes on to argue that instances of such usage incontrovertibly reflected the idiomatic applica tion of the Arabic language. Besides, the Qur'an was revealed in this unsullied dic tion. The crux of Ibn Taymiyya's argument was that the Arabs would have under stood this language without resorting to such superficial linguistic devices or defini tions. And such approaches had a profound theological purpose: they were not descriptive attempts to appreciate the Arabic language. The exegesis of Q. 12:82 presented by al-Qurtubi declares that it proves the incidence of majdz in the Qur'an, a view, he states, shared by the jumhur?9 He relates that if animate behaviour is associated with inanimate matter, this indicates figurative usage or istfdra (stylistic borrowing). However, he mentions that Muhammad ibn Dawud, Abu Ishaq (al-Isfara'Ini), and others rejected this, stating that the speech of the Prophet and the Qur'an had to be understood in literal terms. It is clear, prima facie, that there was little to choose between the interpretation of this particular verse by Ibn Taymiyya and the exegesis presented by the proponents of majdz. However, the reasons why the latters' approach was expressly rejected will become obvious below. To the upholders of a stern religiosity, majdz came to denote an opprobrious term which provided umbrage for a selection of theological assaults on a perceived reli gious orthodoxy, ranging from the controversy regarding the non-created nature of the Qur'an, to the issue of the Divine attributes, and the integral nature of the relation ship between faith and practice. Ibn Taymiyya was able to relinquish the so-called radical interpretation of the doctrine of tawqif al-lugha because it meant that the ref erence to stages of language positing (watf), used to explain the origin of a tropical expression, could not be proven. The only dependable constant was that of language</page><page sequence="11">The Philological Endeavours of the Early Arabic Linguists 53 usage (isticmdl), which in his view rendered a theory of majdz irrelevant. Ibn Taymiyya was impervious to the arguments about the aesthetic value of a theory of majdz as elaborated upon in the works of the rhetoricians. His trepidation was for its theological import and that it was exploited to obfuscate the true diction of scripture; it had to be rejected without reservation. The substance and spirit of the arguments on the theory of majdz were pursued with great vigour by Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya (690-750/1292-1350), the pupil of Ibn Taymiyya, in a work entitled al-Sawdciq al-mursala cald 'l-Jahmiyya wa' l-Muctazi la.40 Ibn Qayyim trenchantly refers to the theory of majdz as a tyranny used to defend an heretical explication of scripture. Ibn Qayyim enters upon a refutation of the prominently applied definitions of majdz, initially taking his reader through a labyrinth of detail relating to the perceived theoretical shortcomings of a concept of majdz41 The general thrust of the reasoning set out by Ibn Taymiyya regarding the role of figures such as Abu cUbayda, Ibn Hanbal, al-Shafici, and other early scholars is presented in Ibn Qayyim's synthesis of this issue.42 He confirms that when these figures had spoken of majdz, they were not alluding to figurative language. Taking the example of al-Shafici, he states that despite his many compilations none of these works comprised references to the feature of majdz. Indeed, he adds that his risdla on the subject of usul al-fiqh contains not a single reference to this presumed feature of language 43 Ibn Qayyim, like his mentor, suggests that the evolved concept of majdz was a deplorable development and, moreover, it was the contrivance of the ologians whose religious integrity was dubious. He endeavours to refute majdz through references to the primary status of usage (istfmdl) and the deceptive nature of the opposition inherent in the haqiqa-majdz division, whether one is suggesting that this was a momentary condition applied to words, meanings, or indeed usage. Ibn Qayyim makes a categorical appeal to orthodoxy by claiming that the division of speech into haqlqa and majdz had no religious, logical, or indeed linguistic bases: it occurs after the third/ninth century.44 Ibn Qayyim then introduces what he describes as the axiomatic definition of haqlqa and majdz proffered by its advocates: a haqlqa word is one whose usage reflects primordial assignment; and a majdz word is one whose usage does not reflect primordial assignment. Ibn Qayyim adds that some advocates of majdz introduced a further category of haqiqa lughawiyya, shafiyya, and curfiyya. He was clearly mindful that this category was introduced to keep theo logically sensitive words within the compass of haqlqa: the aforementioned defini tions had placed them within the sphere of majdz45 It is at this juncture that he intro duces the doctrine of tawqif al-lugha, as this prevented the use of stages of succes sive wadc in the matrix of arguments used to explain theoretically the origin of a majdz term. He states that the revelationist view of language's origin (tawqif al lugha) was adopted by the majority (jumhur al-nds); whilst the istildh view was</page><page sequence="12">54 Journal of Qur'anic Studies articulated by Abu Hashim al-Jubba'I and others.46 Ibn Qayyim hypothesises that, however one defines words, meanings, or usage concerning istildh, one has to pre suppose two successive stages of wad\ but the only indisputable constant across the spectrum of arguments was actual usage (isticmdl). If it were possible to ascertain that alfdz (words) which constitute the language of Arabic were initially assigned mean ings in which contexts they were employed, then at a subsequent juncture the same alfdz were assigned a further meaning through a second stage of wad\ then the inci dence of majdz in the language of the Arabs would be irrefutable. However, the only ascertainable constant was the actual application of words and this had to form the basis of any investigation into language and the diction of scripture. He presents a definition of istildh which suggests that a group of intellectuals gath ered and conventionally started the processes of denomination, positing words with meanings. These words were then used in appropriate contexts before being subject ed to a further stage of deliberate positing, although in this cycle these same alfdz were used for other meanings which were loosely connected with the previous mean ings. However, in this framework of istildh the words were designated majdz and haqiqa. Ibn Qayyim ascribes this definition of istildh to Abu Hashim al-Jubba'I, stating that it was a manifest expression of mendacity 47 He adds that in reality peo ple were only aware of the usage of words and the meanings that they denoted. The contradictions perceived by Ibn Qayyim as inherent in the definitions of majdz were fastidiously seized upon. He refers to a number of words which were used figuratively and purportedly had no haqiqa precursors; he deduces that if they are used for only one meaning, then this given meaning would have been posited at a presumed stage: by the criteria defined by the proponents of majdz, one stage of wadc must point to a haqiqa expression, as each majdz requires a haqiqa which precedes it48 It was the case that the proponents of majdz would suggest that not every expression of this nature requires a preceding haqiqa and vice versa. The strength of Ibn Qayyim's case rested on the fact that the primordial phases of the origin of language were unfath omable and tracing wadc was an utterly elusive exercise, although he did elevate the status of tawqif al-lugha in his structured attempt to dislocate the arguments adduced by the proponents of majdz. The symmetry in the arguments of Ibn Qayyim and Ibn Taymiyya is all too expect ed, yet with the former the implications for an accepted orthodoxy are made so much more apparent and the examples he quotes whilst vitiating the theories of majdz are particularly detailed. His line of argument allows him to allude to the issue of ish tiqdq (derivation) and the issue of whether language was subject to qiyds: this was not the case for it would result in inception and invention. He reports that if it were possible for a mutakallim to form analogies on the basis of spoken words and there by create a stock of further phrases which he might use in everyday speech, it would</page><page sequence="13">The Philological Endeavours of the Early Arabic Linguists 55 be highly unfeasible to extend such analogies to the speech of the Almighty, his Prophet, or indeed, the diction of the Arabs. The principal point here is that one could not use derived forms of language as instruments for the theological interpre tation of scripture; it was tantamount to istildh. Moreover, its ultimate corollary was the incidence of majdz in the language of the Arabs.49 According to Ibn Qayyim, a number of terms were shrewdly designated as emanat ing from secondary cycles of wadc and classified as majdz. In the definitions of majdz repudiated by both Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Qayyim a term such as ra's (head) could only be haqlqa when there were no contextual indicators or restraints: thus when the word ra's is uttered the upper part of the human anatomy containing the brain springs to mind. Once this particular term is used in a situation which is reconciled with sec ondary usage, the tendency was to seek a majdz rendering; the enigma was how does one establish which instance represents the primary or primordial use of a specific term? There was also the issue of contextual restraints: in these figures' view all speech was governed by the parameters of context and convention. Ibn Qayyim argues that this was the case for the attributes of the Almighty in relation to the sifdt al afdl (attributes of acts) such as anger, pleasure or perceived anthropomorphic char acteristics such as the face, the hands, hearing, sight, speech, and will; Ibn Qayyim tells us that these attributes were perceived by the Jahmites as majdz and were inter preted figuratively.50 He argued that the semantic compass of these terms when applied to Creator and created is inevitably determined by the very contexts of speech, so that a distinction in comprehending such terms was natural. The primacy of isticmdl in these arguments circumvents any need for an elaborate history of the appli cation of words, inferring that their significance had been shaped by the vicissitudes of time. The term bahr (sea) refers to all things displaying vastness and expanse; it was not a specific quality of oceans, but could also refer to the recondite nature of a scholar's knowledge; similarly the term dhawq (the experiencing of a sensation) refers to all things savoured, be they delightful or agonising. There was nothing to dictate that it was haqiqa in respect of the mouth and majdz in all other situations.51 Ibn Qayyim stresses that the Almighty's speech was indisputably veridical (haqlqa) and that this was evident in his revealed scripture: the Torah, the Gospel, and the Qur'an: His speech has neither beginning nor end.52 He also recalls that the Almighty had not established a relationship between words and meanings to transfer them at a subsequent time to other meanings; moreover, the speech of God could not be gov erned by the wadc of created beings. It follows that within such confines, a theory of majdz was difficult to uphold. It is the Jahmiyya who are Ibn Qayyim's specific tar gets, although obviously that such theological spins were indulged by some of his contemporaries and predecessors indicates the significance of his comments. It was indeed the Muctazilites who agreed with the Jahmiyya on both the issue of a created</page><page sequence="14">56 Journal of Qur'anic Studies Qur'an whilst also upholding the transcendent nature of the Almighty, although the Muctazilites did reject the deterministic penchant of their cohorts. The device of majdz was invoked to uphold these appropriate doctrinal positions. The Ashcarites were the heirs to maintaining a transcendental approach to the attributes of the Almighty and invoking the device of majdz. Indeed, it was inevitable that the Ashcarites would over the ensuing years find themselves criticised and censured by figures such as Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Qayyim.53 It was apparent that the revelationist interpretation of language's origin was not going to suffice in the battle to suppress the resort to metaphor in the interpretation of scrip ture. It might be perfunctorily invoked, but on a more theoretical plane there were flaws in this concept. Although Ibn Qayyim speaks of tawqif al-lugha as a doctrine accepted by jumhur al-nds in the early parts of his diatribe, he gradually moves on to maintain the line of argument outlined by his mentor Ibn Taymiyya. Indeed, he initially introduces the same stock of statements, frequently quoting his mentor's opinions verbatim. The doctrine of istildh is totally rejected, following the general thrust of arguments presented by Ibn Hazm (384-456/994-1064) in his Ihkdm.54 He suggests that tawqif was an innate quality cultivated by the Almighty, calling it ilhdm.55 This alone accounts for the ability of nutq (articulation) in language; no stages of muwddaca conventionally established by groups of intelligent people can be substantiated as a preceding process. Ibn Qayyim has to refute a logical premise which predicates that wujud al-malzum bi-dun lazimihi muhdl (the existence of an entity without its concomitant is inconceivable), namely that istildh and stages of wadc were important pre-conditions for isti'mdl in any language; if there were no phases of istildh and wad\ then istfmdl would not exist. Ibn Qayyim confronts this thesis by suggesting that it was not religiously binding, and that the empirical facts verify the impetus provided through ilhdm in the acquisition of language.56 Moreover, istildh had only a minor role in these processes, being restricted to the customary augmentation of terminologies. The strength of the arguments of Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Qayyim was made all the more convincing when the defenders of majdz asserted that one of the ways of determining whether a word was haqiqa or majdz was to refer to authorities on language such as al-Khalil, al-AsmacI, and Abu cUbayda who, according to al-Shirazi (d. 476/ 1084), revealed such cases of majdz in his aptly entitled work Majdz al-Qur'an; such arguments were anachronistic.57 It was no coincidence that Ibn Taymiyya elected to begin his own survey of the issue with a reference to the innocuous activities of Abu cUbayda and the fact that in this fig ure's terminology the term majdz had a purely linguistic function. Ibn Qayyim was scathing of Ibn JinnI and his mentor Abu CA1I al-Farisi, who much to the surprise of Loucel and Kopf endorsed the doctrine of tawqif al-lugha.5* In a selection of these linguists' statements provided by Ibn Qayyim one can observe the</page><page sequence="15">The Philological Endeavours of the Early Arabic Linguists 57 manner in which linguistic facts were furtively serving as preludes to theological discussions. Thus, Ibn Jinni asserts that upon reflection the majority of language was majdz, including the bulk of verbs.59 This was because the actions denoted by verbs were never thoroughly accomplished by the subject of the verb: when one says 'Zayd stood up', not every physical aspect of standing up is experienced by the body; it is a perfect example of wadc al-kull mawdic al-bacd (the whole functions as an emplacement for the part), which was a linguistic vehicle of emphasis. Accordingly, it is argued that such an expression is majdz. Abu cAli al-Farisi used a similar rationale to stress this point: when one says 'I emerged to (find) the lions', it is obviously not the case that all the lions of the world were in the vicinity. But for reasons of emphasis the expression is phrased in this form. A number of further examples are cited to illustrate the argument; however, the focus is shifted to the acts of the Qadim (The Eternal One), who as the Khdliq (Creator) of the heavens and the earth, is not the khdliq (author) of our deeds, for if He were the author in the haqlqa (veridical) sense, he would have been the author of disbelief and aggression, alongside other deeds which are initiated by man; the same is also said of the Almighty's cilm (knowledge).60 The corollary of such argumentation was obvious. Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Qayyim endeavour to repudiate the reasoning, dismissing the arguments initially on a linguistic level and supporting this with an appeal to reli gious orthodoxy. Ibn Qayyim refers to Ibn Jinni and Abu cAli al-Farisi as prominent proponents of bidca and ictizdl: they had rejected the veritable speech of the Almighty, denied that He would speak on the Day of Judgement, and asserted that He had no substantive attributes which subsisted in Him - no knowledge, no power, no life, no will, no hearing, and no sight. They had also claimed that He is unable to create the deeds of men and that He has no will over their acts. Ibn Qayyim reconciles this sectarian bent with their pursuit of majdz. It was an instrument which allowed them to circumvent a literal approach to the language of scripture. He adds that these two linguists were able to circulate such contentious views due to the political ascendancy of the Buwayhids and cAdud al-Dawla (ruled 338-72/949-83). The state endorsed the tenets of i'tizdl and rafd, promoting figures such as IsmacIl ibn cAbbad as the state's wazlr and al-Qadi cAbd al-Jabbar as the chief jurisconsult61 Ibn Qayyim then proceeds to expose the supposed frailties in the arguments of these linguists by using the various definitions of majdz to highlight the inconsistencies in their positions. The typical fashion in which this is achieved is to refer to the stages of wadc in which a contrived term is transferred for use in secondary contexts; that the words khalq, Him, and other attributes were first coined by the Almighty creates a hysteron proteron as they are assumed to be majdz: by implication they must be haqlqa.62 Similar arguments per vade throughout the text as contradictions in the argumentation are identified.</page><page sequence="16">58 Journal of Qur'anic Studies The classical theory of majdz also encompassed several sub-mechanisms, including hadhf or idmdr (ellipsis) and taqdir (suppletion). It is noticeable that Ibn Taymiyya was keen to dismiss the relevance of idmdr in his analysis of Q. 12:82. Ibn Qayyim emulates his mentor's analysis with a number of further examples accentuated as axioms of majdz al-hadhf or taqdir. These devices were identified as aesthetic instru ments which also functioned on a theological plane, and Ibn Qayyim was keen to pour scorn on an assertion by Ibn JinnI that examples of hadhf m relation to parts of the genitive construct occurred in the text of the Qur'an in three hundred places.63 Whilst grammarians used taqdir and hadhf to reconcile speech within their own mod els of grammar, Ibn Qayyim suggested they were circumlocutory devices which impaired the clarity of language, although he does concede that in clear-cut cases such devices were useful. However, it was precarious when ellipsis and suppletion were being practised within the framework of majdz to alleviate an assumed anthropo morphic symbolism supposedly inherent in the language of scripture. The con tentious application of hadhf was identified by Ibn Qayyim in the following verses: Q.89-.22, Q.2:210 and Q.22:7. The first part of the first verse was textually restored to wa-jd'a (amr(u)) rabbika in place of wa-jd'a rabbuka. It was hypothesised that the muddf(amr) was ellipsed, and this was the case for the second verse. The use of restoration (taqdir) seemingly obviated the connotation of physical movement on the part of the Almighty. The proponents of such a view might suggest that identical verses to the one restored did occur in the Qur'an: Q.l 1:101.64 Yet for Ibn Qayyim the issue was one of theological importance; such a theory emanated from a Jahmite approach to language which aimed at negating the acts of the Almighty and, more over, the sentences in question were not grammatically deficient. In the case of the third verse it is suggested that the ellipsed term was arwdh (souls); thus the souls of the dead are raised from their graves. According to Ibn Qayyim, all such interpreta tion of this kind removes speech from its apparent contexts.65 Ibn Qayyim is per plexed by the fact that Ibn Jinni should suggest that Q.4:164 was a haqiqa expres sion (i.e. that God had spoken to Musa). In propounding this view he had contra dicted the principles which had led him to state that God's creation of the heavens and the earth was majdz and that God's Him was majdz; he contrasts this with the view of the Jahmiyya and Kullabites who reported that in the context of Q.4:164 His speech was majdz. He adds that those who argued that the Qur'an was created were of two opinions: some suggested God's speech to Musa was haqiqa and others claimed it was majdz. It is intriguing to note that amongst the Basran grammarians one finds Abu Jacfar al-Nahhas (d. 337/948) suggesting that a figurative spin of the verse was untenable due to the presence of the masdar (taklim) in the verse and, fur thermore, this was the opinion of the majority of Basran linguists.66 His predecessor in the Basran school al-Akhfash al-Awsat does forward what was subsequently iden tified as a majdz interpretation, saying that God's address to Musa was created and</page><page sequence="17">The Philological Endeavours of the Early Arabic Linguists 59 conveyed through a medium. It appears that Ibn Jinni was adhering to the opinion of his Basran colleagues in this respect. The second section of Ibn Qayyim's diatribe against majdz is principally devoted to the specific Qur'anic verses in which a tropical exposition is sought. All attempts to pro vide scripture with a figurative bent through a theory of majdz are actively disparaged. Having set out to show that this controversial device was contrived by the exponents of ictizdl, Ibn Qayyim refuses to sanction the activities of those who wished to pursue the literary merits of the features of majdz; it was also deemed to be a superfluous device in the hands of the jurists as it was not an indispensable instrument for the analy sis of scripture. He quotes both al-Shafici and al-Razi and their view that the explicit (zdhir) meaning of texts of legal significance must form the basis of juristic abstrac tion, a figurative approach to such texts would render the greater part of law virtually redundant.67 The religious significance of the issues here and the implications for an unyielding religious orthodoxy were enormous. The allusions to the theory of majdz embodied all that was heretical in the theology of the Jahmites, the Muctazilites, the Murji'ites, and, indeed, the Ashcarites. It had become the conduit for a host of specu lative theology, which according to figures of the mettle of Ibn Taymiyya, could not be reconciled with the spirit of orthodoxy upheld by the pious ancestors. A consider able amount of the second part of the text is devoted to an in-depth analysis of the term istiwd" (the ascent of the Almighty). Ibn Qayyim examines its occurrence in the Qur'an, dismissing the suggestion that it was a majdz expression and, furthermore, ridiculing the attempts to equate istiwd' with the term istawld (gaining ascendancy), a subtle metaphorical shift as advanced by a number of Muctazilites. This figurative explanation is described as a menacing extension of the thesis of majdz.6* cAbd al-Qahir al-Jurjani elegantly ruminates over the extremes in the various approaches to these issues, highlighting the aforementioned selection of verses which dominated discussions on the subject of the incidence of majdz in scripture and the language of the Arabs. He insists that it was an indispensable tool for apprentices of faith.69 He intimates that the rejection of such a phenomenon was perilous: the devel oped concept of majdz embodied indisputable characteristics and stylistic features of the diction of Arabic. In respect of some of the verses discussed by Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Qayyim, al-Jurjani argues that arrival and advent, as seemingly implied in the language of such verses, predicate movement; these qualities were per se attrib utes of physical bodies. It was imperative to accept a majdz interpretation of such verses. Regarding the issue of istiwa, if it were interpreted literally, it would only be correctly applied to a corporeal body which occupied space and was restricted to locality: not true of the Eternal Creator. He also speaks of the antics of advocates of the other extreme: some proponents of majdz, who in essence pursued a deviantly arcane objective, and whose intent was dissimulation. Al-Jurjani argues that whilst</page><page sequence="18">60 Journal of Qur'anic Studies one had to appreciate the essential features of the Arabic idiom, it was erroneous to perceive scripture as something steeped in esoteric vagaries and indiscernible mean ings.70 Ultimately, the views defiantly expressed by Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Qayyim were perceived as too conservative. The consensus amongst orthodox scholars who preceded these two figures, and indeed, those of later generations, was to endorse pre eminently the posterior concept of the haqiqa-majdz dichotomy in all aspects of their approach to language, whether the format was theological, juristic, exegetical, or lin guistic. Thus the general perception was that these two scholars and those who sub scribed to their views were altogether radicals and certainly in a minority, although their supporters would continue to see them as defenders of religious rectitude. Moreover, some orthodox theologians who countenanced a seemingly rational approach to theology, felt that denying the concept of majdz served no real purpose. The fears of sectarian attacks against orthodoxy had subsided. Hence one finds Abu Hamid al-Ghazali (449-505/1058-1 111) re-evaluating Abu Ishaq al-Isfara'Ini's denial of majdz to suggest he had implicitly endorsed its incidence in the language, whilst also pronouncing that the Qur'an comprised majdz expressions.71 Amongst the schol ars of the Qur'anic sciences such as Badr al-Din al-Zarkashi and al-Suyuti, a robust defence of the occurrence of majdz in the Qur'an was articulated; they suggested that a theory of majdz had to be applied to the interpretation of the language of scripture.72 The Egyptian man of letters Mustafa Sadiq al-Rafici wrote that those who rejected majdz had denied a necessity and invalidated the beauty of the language of the Arabs. He had also observed that those who endorsed tawqif al-lugha had reacted out of a false sense of religious piety.73 However, the theological background to such argu ments had been inexorably obscured. The linguistic implications of the discussions were now in the ascendancy; and given such circumstances, the developed concept of majdz was no longer so controversial. Conclusions The attenuation of the doctrine of tawqif al-lugha was an inevitable consequence of the philological endeavours of the linguists who had paradoxically endorsed this belief in their linguistic treatises. They developed a hybrid selection of impressive theories such as ishtiqdq, ishtirdk, tardduf and adddd, which undermined the import of an accepted doctrine. The doctrine of tawqif al-lugha was, as suggested by Weiss, engendered by the need to suppress Muctazilite doctrines on the nature of the Qur'an. Moreover, those who had subscribed to this doctrine were initially trying to place distance between themselves and the Muctazilites. Figures such as Ibn Taymiyya had concluded that the texts of scripture had never defined in a categorical fashion the doc trine of tawqif It was clear that tawqif al-lugha could not be advanced to explain the linear development of the diction of carabiyya. Yet there was no denying a role for divine revelation in language's origin.</page><page sequence="19">The Philological Endeavours of the Early Arabic Linguists 61 The situation had become precarious with the crystallisation of a theory of majdz, which was a potentially tendentious instrument in the hands of the speculative the ologians. In the formative years it was a device which was purely linguistic and inci dental to theological speculation. It evolved simultaneously with istildh as a mech anism employed to alleviate the angularities imposed by a literal approach to lan guage; it was also applied to buttress prefigured theological predilections which pro voked the defiant response of those of a stern religiosity. Far from endorsing an extreme interpretation of the revelationist origin of language, not only did Ibn Taymiyya realise that the proponents of majdz were exploiting the theory of istildh, suggesting it substantiated their explanations of the majdz phenomenon, they might also retort that the processes of tawqif engendered words which were designated as majdz at the primordial point of language's inception. Accordingly, the only effec tive way of countering such reasoning along with the theological suppositions which flowed from this was to relinquish the former doctrine on language's origin and emphasise a more pragmatic approach to this predicament; hence the reference to lin guistic usage (isticmdl). The acceptance of the doctrine of tawqif did initially hinder a theoretical elaboration of majdz by ridiculing successive stages of wadc. However, a more effective defence was mounted on the issue of linguistic usage (isticmdl), which curiously diffused the significance of tawqif al-lugha. However, both Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Qayyim were concerned only for the theological gravity of accept ing a theory of majdz; it is this concern which shaped their contributions to the debate on tawqif and istildh. Scholars such as Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Qayyim were in a minority regarding the validity of the resort to metaphor in resolving the lan guage of scripture: the device of majdz was able to leave an indelible mark on the currency of a developing Islamic theology. This brings us again to the endeavours of the earliest linguists and the question of whether they were hindered by religious doctrines in elaborating their own linguistic abstraction. It is clear from the examples we examined in Part I that linguists set out their theories of language without necessarily taking into account fully the implica tions for religious orthodoxy. This was certainly the case for many linguists of the Basran and Kufan traditions. The earliest linguists were essentially readers (qurrd') who advocated an altogether functional approach to language predisposed to the serv ice of scripture. That subsequent generations of linguists elected to focus on materi al of a more profane nature, reflects a shift which had occurred within the linguistic tradition. Although such a revolutionary approach was primarily extended to resolve linguistic aspects of scripture, particularly in relation to the body of lectiones (qird'di), it ironically becomes the standard for justifying the linguistic idiosyn crasies of scripture. It was an unacceptable development in the eyes of the upholders of orthodoxy. Furthermore, Kufan linguists, who are traditionally associated with</page><page sequence="20">62 Journal of Qur'anic Studies confining their linguistic endeavours to the text of the Qur'an, made substantial con tributions to the elaboration of philological theories; indeed, they were as radical as their Basran counterparts in their approach to the phenomenon of language.

He points out that amongst early scholars the issue here is one of 'movement' in meaning. However, for a scholar like Ibn Taymiyya this term was invoked in attempts to explain away the appar ent language of scripture (Weiss, The Search, p. 135 ff.). 16 Ibn Taymiyya, Kitab al-imdn, pp. 79-80. 17 Ibid., p. 80. 18 Ibid., pp. 82-6. 19 Heinrichs also refers to this work in some detail, see 'Genesis', p. 116 and p. 140 (footnotes).

I, p. 112. 29 Weiss offers an excellent explanation of the ambiguous status of 'wadc prior to usage'. It implies that words are in a unique state of being assigned mawdiic: subsequent ly their application in phrases governs whether they are haqiqa and majdz. This obviates the need for a majdz phrase to depend on a preceding haqiqa one. Cf. Weiss, The Search, p. 137. 30 Ibn Taymiyya, Kitab al-imdn, p. 82.

Weiss, The Search, pp. 145-6, in which he debates the view that words were designated haqiqa and majdz at the primordial moment of language's inception.</page><page sequence="22">64 Journal of Qur'anic Studies 32 Ibn Taymiyya, Kitab al-imdn, p. 83. 33 Ibid., p. 86. Heinrichs reported that Ibn Taymiyya came very close to describing the haqiqa-majdz terminology as a bidca, in actual fact he does just that when denying that the Qur'an comprised majdz expressions, stating that 'the division of language into haqiqa and majdz is a division which is an innovation and a post-salafi development'(p. 102); cf. Heinrichs, 'Genesis', p. 117. 34 Ibn Taymiyya, Kitab al-imdn, p. 87; Weiss, The Search, pp. 142-7. These terms are discussed regarding Amidi's Ihkdm. 35 Ibn Taymiyya, Kitab al-imdn, pp. 98-9. Cf. Ibn Taymiyya, Majmif, vol. XII, pp. 465-9 (Weiss says the issue of foreign words in the Qur'an is addressed therein); Abu Hamid al Ghazali, al-Mankhiil fi taHiqdt al-usul, ed. M. H. Haytu (Beirut: Dar al-Hadith, 1971), pp. 72-6. 36 Ibn Taymiyya, Kitab al-imdn, pp. 87-103. 37 Ibn Taymiyya, Kitab al-imdn, pp. 87-97. Cf. Ibn Qutayba, Ta'wil, pp. 132-33. Other references to majdz such as Q.19:4, are also repudiated in his synopsis: see Majmif, vol. XII, pp. 464-6. 38 A. J. Arberry, The Koran Interpreted, (Oxford World Classics: OUP, 1964), p. 297; Ibn Taymiyya, Kitab al-imdn, pp. 97-8. 39 Al-Qurtubi, Abu cAbd Allah Muhammad al-Ansari, al-Jdmf li-ahkdm al-Qur'an (21 vols., Beirut: Dar al-Kutub al-cIlmiyya, 1988), vol. IV, pp. 19-20. He also speaks of istfdra. 40 Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, Mukhtasar al-sawdHq al-mursala cald 'l-Jahmiyya wa'l Muctazila, abridged by Muhammad ibn al-Mawsili, 2 vols in 1, (Riyadh: Maktabat al Riyadh al-Haditha, n.d.) vol. II, pp. 2-446. For further discussions of these divisions of the haqiqa see al-Razi, al-Mahsul, vol. I, p. 117-29, and al-Shawkani, Irshdd al-fuhul, p. 21 ff. These are also examined in al-Ghazali's al-Mustasfa min Him al-usul. 41 In the early part of his diatribe, he derides fifty-one theoretical definitions adduced to support majdz. 42 Abu Bakr, SawdHq, pp. 2-4. 43 Ibid., p. 3. 44 He implicitly links this with the hadith which declares that the best of centuries is the Prophet's century and then the following two centuries; the division of speech in terms of majdz and haqiqa occurs after that blessed period and is therefore lacking in authority. 45 The implications of this were already discussed by Ibn Taymiyya, Kitab al-imdn, cf. Weiss's observations on the subject in The Search, pp. 142-3 and pp. 147-8. 46 Ibn Qayyim, al-SawdHq, vol. I, pp. 6-7. Cf. Siraj al-Din al-Urmawi's al-Tahsil, vol. I, pp. 221-29 for a discussion of the significance of haqiqa lughawiyya and haqiqa sharHyya; the rhetoricians had no interest in these divisions; also Ibn Faris, al-Sdhibi, pp. 78-86, for a discussion of terms such as mu'min and kdfir and their Islamic prove nance. Ibn Qayyim refers to Abu Hashim and al-Jubba'i as one person. 47 Ibid., p. 7. 48 Ibn Qayyim, al-SawdHq, vol. II, pp. 8-9. Proponents of majdz argued that a majdz expression could be negated; however, negation could not be applied to a haqiqa expres sion. Ibn Qayyim adduces a selection of terms which were undoubtedly haqiqa but it was also possible to negate them, hence the statement: 'He is not a mu'min' or: 'He is not fast</page><page sequence="23">The Philological Endeavours of the Early Arabic Linguists 65 ing'. Furthermore, if one insists that majdz is distinguished by the presence of a contex tual clue, then all speech is subject to contextual restraints such as grammatical function within the parameters of speech, which in turn govern the semantic value of words and accordingly must be majdz; it also follows that the Qur'an was majdz, and this was a fallacious statement contrary to the a si (p. 22 ff.). Cf. Ibn Taymiyya, Majmu\ vol. XII, p. 491 ff. 49 Ibid., vol. II, p. 24 ff. Cf. Ibn Taymiyya, Kitab al-imdn, p. 88, and Majmu\ vol. XII, pp. 416-20. 50 Ibn Qayyim, al-Sawdciq, p. 29. He also applies similar arguments in analysing con text in the application of words such as makr (plotting or trickery) and the fact that there had to be an abject disparity in the semantic compass of these terms when applied to the Almighty, and when such terms were used to describe the activities of human beings (see pp. 30-6). 51 Ibid., p. 42-3. Cf. Ibn Taymiyya, Kitab al-imdn, pp. 98-9. The same principle is extended to words like jandh, rahma, and risha. These arguments are covered extensive ly in Ibn Taymiyya's Majmuc, vol. XII, p. 472 ff., also p. 436 for the discussion of indi vidual words. 52 Ibn Qayyim, al-Sawaciq, p. 42. 53 Cf.

He argues that when one says 'I hit cUmar', the assault does not affect the entire body, it may apply to his fingers, or just a part of his body. In an identical fig urative vein the same was true of an amir's cutting off the hand of a thief. 61 Ibid., p. 83. Ibn Taymiyya also expresses his dismay at the endeavours of Ibn Jinni, suggesting that one of his works was an excellent testimony to his learning and it was therefore hard to understand his lapses in respect of these doctrines (Majmuc, vol XII, p. 486); also of interest was the fact that Ibn Faris devoted his Sdhibi to the aforementioned Ismacil Ibn cAbbad. 62 Ibid., p. 90. 63 Ibid., p. 98. He is speaking of hadhf al-muddf, allegedly exemplified in Q.12:82. 64 Ibid., p. 100. It is reported by Ibn Kathir that Ahmad ibn Hanbal also supported this rendition, although we should note that he was also mistakenly associated with an endorsement of majdz. See the biography of Ibn Hanbal in Ibn Kathir's al-Biddya wa'l nihdya. Cf. analysis on pp. 106-7 of al-SawdHq. 65 Ibid., p. 101. Reference is made to the use of abbreviation, elision, circumlocution and emphasis as selected features of Arabic; their use did not immediately render speech majdz. 66 Al-Nahhas, Abu Jacfar Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Ismacil, Trdb al-Qur'dn, ed.

See my forthcoming article 'The Controversy Regarding istiwd': Linguistic Contributions to Islamic Theology'. The term istiwd' was the subject of a pro fusion of paraphrase by linguists. The context in relation to the Qur'an highlights God's directing Himself either metaphorically or veridically to the heavens and earth, or to His throne; this is also applied to turning His attention to the affairs of something. Indeed, some scholars insisted on a veridical interpretation of the verse speaking of a 'rising', a 'mounting', or a 'climbing': cald calayhd and irtafaca. 69 cAbd al-Qahir al-Jurjani, Asrdr al-baldgha fi Him al-bayan, ed.
