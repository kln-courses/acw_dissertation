      <p>This fine collection exemplifies one way (among many) in which the history of science can be brought into dialogue with contemporary issues and practices—in this case, those of museology. With the historian of science Samuel Alberti, director of museums and archives at the Royal College of Surgeons in London, as editor, the book's contributors come in large part from the world of museum curators. Their collective insight is to frame the analysis of taxidermied specimens in terms of the “extended biographies” of the animals in question, treating their life stories as trajectories from the living animals through their deaths and transformation into taxidermied objects.</p>
      <p>As seven of the eleven principal chapters demonstrate, this approach is especially apt for celebrity animals. Most became known to the public through their lives in menageries and zoos; the exceptions are Balto the Dog, who gained his celebrity from his role in bringing diphtheria antitoxin to Nome, Alaska, in 1925, and the Thames Whale, a celebrity in life for only three days in January 2006 when it swam upriver to London to its untimely end. The animals parade forward through time, led by Queen Charlotte's zebra (who died in 1773), followed by two nineteenth-century elephants, Maharajah and Sir Roger, succeeded in the twentieth century by Alfred the gorilla and Chi-Chi the panda; the Thames Whale brings up the rear. But “parade” is the wrong metaphor. Individually, to be sure, the chapters offer chronologically successive insights into the particular historical moments at which the animals lived and died—telling the stories of their lives, analyzing their cultural associations at death, and examining related issues such as the connections of zoos to museums and the taxidermy techniques used to mount the animals (or, in the case of whales, the stripping down to skeletons, since whale skins do not take to mounting). But since their “afterlives” all extend to the present, they end up together, with us now. Collectively, these essays present a larger history of mounted exhibits in the history of museum science and culture. This shows the role of display specimens changing over time, from one in which they bore both scientific and other cultural values, to one in which popular associations were most prominent, and most recently to a meta-level in which the cultural history of the animal itself becomes the object of attention.</p>
      <p>If these chapters sit easily together within the comfort zone of historians of science, the rest lead in directions more likely to unsettle. These direct our attention to different ways of finding meaning in taxidermied specimens, whether by focusing on anonymous study skins, exhibits in museum spaces, or private hunting trophy collections. Perhaps the most haunting essay is by Merle Patchett, Kate Foster, and Hayden Lorimer. So little is known about either the life or the afterlife of the object of their attention, a museum study skin of a female hen harrier (a bird of prey), that in order to comment on its life and meditate on the human–animal relationships in which it and its kin are entangled the authors embark on a fascinating combination of social and environmental history, art, and creative writing. They challenge as anthropomorphic the volume's very concept of an extended “animal biography” and ask us to imagine a different way of approaching the animal remnant and its former life, as it touched and was touched by humans.</p>
      <p>Also especially noteworthy is Garry Marvin's thoughtful discussion of taxidermied hunting trophies. He argues that they carry meaning only as long as they are connected to the stories of the hunters; as such, their cultural significance dies with the hunter. One might reasonably counter that their cultural significance changes at that point, rather than going away—if <italic>The Afterlives of Animals</italic> as a whole has shown us anything, it is that new cultural meaning is always being found for taxidermied objects. Nevertheless, I especially appreciated this chapter because it takes hunters seriously as meaning makers, rather than as mindless killers, challenging a certain knee-jerk reaction one often sees among academics.</p>
      <p>This collection thus opens up several new ways of thinking about taxidermied animals. Its intellectual fruitfulness should inspire exploration down new avenues. As Geoffrey Swinney notes in his afterword, “animals” are represented here almost exclusively by mammals (and one bird). Reptiles, fish, and invertebrates are excluded, perhaps because they rarely acquire celebrity status as beloved individuals, perhaps because they are not preserved in the same way as mammals and birds. Yet they also have afterlives as museum specimens worth investigating. Moreover, these essays concentrate almost exclusively on Anglophone museums (mostly British). Would the story be the same in Germany, Sweden, or Russia, or in tropical-zone museums where the conditions and methods of preservation might have been significantly different? We can hope that someone, inspired by these essays, might find out.</p>
