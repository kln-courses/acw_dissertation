<plain_text><page sequence="1">Educational Policy and Political Development in Africa By E. R. J. HUSSEY, C.M.G. This article is an abridged version of a lecture given on the 28th November at a combined meeting with the Royal Empire Society, Lord Hailey being in the Chair. Mr. Hussey has been Director of Education in Uganda and Nigeria, and Educational Adviser to the Emperor of Ethiopia. He is now working for the British Council. A GREAT deal of attention both in this country and abroad is focussed on our past achievements in our Colonial Empire and our future plans in regard to it, and perhaps in some quarters our African Dependencies occupy a very large share of the limelight. In those Dependencies too there is a natural uneasiness as to our future policy-an uneasiness which has been accentuated by the war. African manpower has been used in important theatres of war, and the returning warriors are travelled men. They have experienced the mental stimulus which comes from travel and observation of conditions outside their own country. They have been well cared for and in many instances they have been given a thorough training in literacy and subjects of general application in addition to that which has to do with their duties as soldiers. They will assuredly act as a ferment in the mass of the populations in which they are being absorbed, and as a result we may expect an intensity of interest and indeed some impatience in regard to the political future of their respective countries. The British and Colonial Governments are taking active steps to reap the fruits of this awakening of the African</page><page sequence="2">EDUCATIONAL POLICY AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT IN AFRICA 73 peoples and to direct African aspirations into channels which may, with British assistance, lead to an era of increased prosperity and well-being on the one hand and political progress on the other. The r61e of education in plans for the future is obviously an important one, and it is in regard par- ticularly to its influence in the political field that I want to address you. I must make it quite clear that I am not for a moment claiming that educa- tion has or should have any direct responsibility for political forms, but it is to its indirect bearing in the political sphere that I should like to direct your attention. It is, of course, well known that the missionaries have the credit for being the pioneers of education in our African Colonies and that on the foundations which they laid with such devoted service government systems of education were built up. The fact that character-training is throughout these Colonies regarded as a pre-eminent aspect of education is mainly due to the nature of its growth in those early days when education in non-Muhamnmedan areas was almost completely identified with conversion to Christianity. Moral teaching, which relied on the sanctions of religion, was given first place in the content of instruction. In Muhammedan areas where the Missions have not worked so intensively or with such success, the emphasis on this aspect of training was always implicit in Koranic schools and has been an important feature in schools opened by the government. This emphasis on moral and religious background still persists, and though, as in all countries, there ar.e many who in mature age discard the idealism of youth, it is of great im- portance for the future political development that there are a large number of men and women who are actuated by high ideals derived from early training. Another point worth noting at this stage is that the Churches led the way in the training of Africans for posts of higher responsibility. Fourah Bay College in Sierra Leone was founded as early as 1827 to train leaders in the Church and other walks of life. Bishop Crowther, a Yoruba by birth, was ordained Bishop of the Niger in 1864. When Education Departments were formed by the various governments there was at first no common policy. In fact, the Department was in most cases a Cinderella among government departments, and far from being con- sidered as a source of strength for political development it was by some people actually considered a menace. As a result of education, Africans began to think more about personal and national problems and even to criticise government action in regard to them. Administration was directed in those early days for the most part to establishing public security, developing the country and maintaining good government with the very limited financial resources available. At this stage the beginnings of national consciousness and individual aspirations complicated the work of the administrators, and it was some time before it came to be generally realised that what was needed was more and not less education. But it was not until the influence of the Advisory Committee on Education in the Colonies, formed in I924, began to be felt that there emerged comprehensive policies of somewhat similar pattern in all these dependencies. Even before the formation of the Advisory Committee colonial governments were embarking upon higher</page><page sequence="3">74 AFRICAN AFFAIRS education. I have already mentioned the fact that the Fourah Bay College in Sierra Leone was started by the Church Missionary Society in 1827. Makerere College in Uganda began its life as an Institute of Higher Education in 1925. Achimota, on the Gold Coast, developed university classes shortly afterwards, and the High College at Yaba in Nigeria was opened in I934, providing academic and professional courses, the latter in collaboration with the technical departments. Meanwhile, in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan the Gordon College, which had been started in I899, with the intention that it should pass through primary and secondary stages and eventually become an Institution of Higher Education, has now assumed that r61e. But for the most part these institutions of higher learning were starved for money, and it is only in comparatively recent times that their value to the countries concerned on the political and economic sides has been realised and rewarded with more generous fianancial support. I should now like to make a few remarks on political development in the African Colonies. This is a matter which has been the object of study by many qualified administrators and observers in recent years and about which very valuable contributions have been published by such eminent authorities as Lord Hailey, Miss Perham and Sir Donald Cameron. As a result, there has been very considerable political development in the African dependencies. For the purpose of this address I will not attempt to do more than give a picture, over simplified, but suggestive, I hope, in regard to the question we are considering. I have already noted the fact that in the early years political administrators had as their first duty the establishment of public security. A simple form of government was generally set up, under which British officials gradually introduced the principles of law and order. But at first it was essentially a British Government, and the African rulers were the agents of the controlling British administrators and were given but little scope for initiative or inde- pendent responsibility. It was not long, however, before a new conception of African administration, with which the names of Lord Lugard and Sir Donald Cameron are particularly associated, gained ground and was gradually applied to the various territories of British Colonial Africa. This conception, which is generally summed up in the phrase "Indirect Rule" is familiar to everyone connected with Africa. It is, of course, similar in many respects to what we know as local government in Britain. Now there are two methods, complementary to each other, which have been used for training an African people for political progress. The first is to associate capable and qualified Africans with Europeans in the higher grades of officialdom so that by working on an equality and side by side with Europeans, they may assimilate the traditions of public service and form a gradually increasing proportion of the Government hierarchy of senior officials. The second method is to develop local government in accordance with the principles proclaimed and adopted by Lord Lugard and Sir Donald Cameron, which, while giving the local authorities a progressively increasing share in the management of local affairs, provided also a training ground for the wider responsibilities at the centre. In this process the political officer</page><page sequence="4">EDUCATIONAL POLICY AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT IN AFRICA 75 assumes the r61e of political schoolmaster rather than that of an executive official. There has been some uncertainty, however, as to how a central government could gradually be evolved working upwards from the political forms adopted in Native administration. Inter-tribal and local jealousies are still strong, and the method of applying the principle of representation has been in doubt. Moreover, educated Africans on the central legislature have not always welcomed the proposal to share their responsibilities with repre- sentatives of native administrations, upon which they are inclined to look with some suspicion. Now the proposals for a revision of the Constitution of Nigeria, recently published by the Stationery Office, give us the first example of an attempt to move towards the next stage on the road to self-government. It is fitting that the experiment should first be tried in Nigeria, where the development of local government has proceeded more rapidly than in most other territories. Mr. Hussey here outlined the new Nigerian Constitution, summarised in African Affairs, No. 176. Many of the criticisms of the proposals seem to overlook the fact that this move marks only a stage in the evolutionary process and can be followed by a further stage as soon as such advance is warranted. It is perhaps of interest here to note a move in the same direction on the part of the Government of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. In September, 1943, the Governor-General in Council passed two ordinances. The first was an ordinance for establishing Province Councils, of which the Provincial Governor was to be Chairman, and a proportion of the members were to be elected from amongst the persons who are local government authorities or members of local government authorities established in the Provinces. Their powers were to be mainly advisory, but there is also provision for powers and duties to be delegated to them by the Governor. The second ordinance was the Advisory Council's Ordinance. An Advisory Council for the Northern Sudan was thereby established, containing in addition to nominated members, representatives of the more important social and economic interests in the Sudan and members appointed from each Pro- vincial Council by nomination or after election by the members of such Councils. To this Council are referred for advice questions of political, economic and social importance and the advice tendered by the Council is usually acted upon by the Government. A record of the deliberations of this Advisory Council gives evidence of a high degree of statesmanship and political sense. It is probable that we shall see in the not-too-distant future other attempts to move in the direction of giving the Africans far more responsibility at the centre, which, in progressive stages, will lead eventually to dominion status. In this extremely critical transition stage, during which a process of increased African responsibility at the centre will accompany a further evolution of local government at the circumference and the principle of popular representation will be developed along lines which will eventually give to the rank and file of the population responsibility in the political sphere, Education must occupy a key position.</page><page sequence="5">76 AFRICAN AFFAIRS I should like to suggest some ways in which Educational policy should be directed so as to prepare the way for and assist political evolution. (I) In its own organisation the Educational Department should become a model for training African officials to take positions of responsibility through the appointment and employment of suitable and experienced men and women to serve with equal status alongside Europeans in the education hierarchy. (2) By the establishment of local Education Committees throughout the country there will be an opportunity for setting a standard in local adminis- tration in places where local government of the type we have been considering has not yet taken very definite shape. (3) Throughout the educational system there should be included at all stages instruction in citizenship which would be represented as involving great responsibilities as well as privileges. The Institute of Education at Bakht er Ruda in the Sudan, where very successful results have already been achieved, presents a useful model which might well be copied in all our African Dependencies. One of the features of this Institute is the training of schoolmasters, and a special aspect of this course is a training in citizenship. Another feature is that of research and experiment. In this are included, the compilation of textbooks, improvement in the curricula, consideration of the ways and means of improving through education the social and economic life of the people, and so on. There is a staff of about six Europeans and several Africans who collaborate freely in these projects. Such an Institute of Education in each of our African Dependencies should be instrumental in implanting in the population an understanding of true citizenship and in demonstrating the various ways in which a man, or woman, boy or girl, can become a good citizen by directing his work and his interests to the benefit of himself and his family, his town or village, and his country. These Institutes would be of particular value at the present time in view of the efforts being made in our African Depen- dencies to expand education very rapidly and they would act as a check on any tendency to sacrifice quality for quantity. (4) Collaboration at every stage with other departments of government is required in order to adapt the content of the education given to the needs of the population with appropriate adjustments as those needs develop. (5) There is the important question of the establishment on firm founda- tions of higher education in the African Colonies. Two reports on higher education which have recently been published, the Asquith Report on Higher Education in the Colonies, and the Elliot Report on Higher Education in West Africa, are documents of lasting value and importance for the African Colonies. It is to be hoped that these Reports will be carefully studied both here and in Africa by all who have the welfare of Africa at heart. It is important to note in this connection that the Elliot Commission devoted a great deal of time to the study of the local background and to the necessity of shaping the course of educational expansion towards producing an elite of educated men and women, well-qualified to develop the resources of their country and be leaders in all its activities. I will not, therefore, say</page><page sequence="6">EDUCATIONAL POLICY AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT IN AFRICA 77 more here on that than that if the plans envisaged in these Reports are realised and put into effect throughout the African Colonies, as assuredly they will, a great contribution will be made through higher education to political development. For an African Colony to advance towards political freedom it is of paramount importance that it should possess a body of men and women who have had the advantages of education as good as can be obtained in any country in the world. (6) Lastly, there are many other ways in which education rightly con- ceived and carried out can help indirectly in political development, too many to be mentioned in detail; and the Directors of Education and Education Officers should be quick to grasp opportunities that present themselves. For example, African members of the Education Department may be elected on to local government councils. In such cases every opportunity should be given for them to serve in this way even though it may at times conflict somewhat with their departmental duties. Again, semi-political bodies of Africans are often formed in various parts. The Education Department and its officials may be invited to give assistance to such bodies. These organisa- tions are natural and healthy, even if they are at times unreasonably critical of government policy. It may be, for example, that they would like assistance from the Education Department or its officers in regard to libraries or lecture courses on subjects of academic or general interest. Whenever such assistance is sought it should be freely given, and any such desires expressed by these associations should be warmly welcomed. In such ways as these members of the Education Department, who have very special ties with the younger generation, can influence the course of events. Educated Africans are naturally interested in the shape of political forms, but that is of less importance than the right attitude born of knowledge and experience towards the use of such forms to the best advantage of a country, aspiring to membership of a fraternity of free nations. So far I have been discussing problems of education and administration which have application particularly to those colonies in which the permanent elements in the population are African. I have not considered the problem from the angle in which it has to be considered in Kenya and some other areas, where European settlers form a permanent element in a population composed mainly of people of African stock. I would, however, like to point out that although more complex the problem is essentially the same. Educa- tion in the widest sense should lead to the raising of standards, not only intellectual standards, but all those standards which are involved in assimila- tion of a higher civilisation; and ultimately we ought to find the African population attaining to standards which approximate to those of Europeans of the same grade in skill and accomplishment. This process over the whole population in every colony will take a long time, but in so far as elements in the African population rise to the general European standard, so will they become qualified to take their share in the government of the country. If they are wise they will strive with their increased responsibilities to speed the process for the rest of their countrymen, retaining as their political goal a polity in which both races, through their respective representatives, look</page><page sequence="7">78 AFRICAN AFFAIRS upon themselves as trustees for the progress of the country as a whole, and not merely for one section of it. This is not the time, nor am I qualified to speak in detail about this thorny question, but I do suggest that here again we find the reaction of educational policy upon political development. If education in such a colony is orientated in the way described above, political development will take a shape in which each individual will have his chance. There will be many difficulties to be solved, but the final goal should not be impossible of achievement if this principle is fully recognised and all sections in the country strive to give effect to it. I have tried very shortly to state what in my view should be in the main the relationship between educational policy and political development. There are many people here to-day of wide knowledge and experience in African affairs, and I hope that my remarks this afternoon will be considered as an introduction to the subject, and an invitation to members of the audi- ence to help us all to clear our minds on a subject which I firmly believe to be one of very great importance for the future of our African Colonies. Discussion Sir Bernard Bourdillon said that two points occurred to him. Mr. Hussey mentioned a certain suspicion existing in the minds of the unofficial members of the Legislative Council in Nigeria in connection with Native Administration, but he thought that after Mr. Hussey left Nigeria things moved in the right direction as quite a number of the unofficial members of the Legislative Council regarded themselves as definitely represent- ing certain of the Native Administrations, and in general the attitude of the Legislative Council to the Administrations had changed very considerably. Sir Donald Cameron at one time entertained the idea of introducing Native Administration into the Colony but abandoned it because it was unanimously opposed by the unofficial members of the Legislative Council. Eleven years later he himself revived the idea and carried it through because it was as unanimously supported by the unofficial members-which was proof that their suspicions had abated. He would like to make that clear, because it was of great importance and showed that the danger of active antagonism between the younger, modern, educated, politically-minded class and the old traditional chiefs had been avoided, not so much by what the Europeans had done but by the people themselves. A second point was that there appeared to be a very serious gap between the movement for political education throughout Africa and its responsible press. It was not easy to over-estimate the importance of that gap. At the present moment the widely read press in Africa was in the hands of the young, politically-minded African, and, quite frankly, it was not a good press. There was nothing to counteract it, to present a sober realistic point of view, and it was useless to think that that gap could be filled by any Government publication. In Northern Nigeria there was a Government newspaper with the title Gaskiya ta fi Kwabo (Truth is worth more than a penny) which was very successful because it was published in Hausa, the language of Northern Nigeria. It had no competition because it was not worth anybody's while to publish another paper in the language. There was a great need for a solid and sober press. It was useless the Government trying to publish a paper where the "yellow" press had already got a hold and he hoped the British Council would take up the idea. He believed that papers published by the British Council which would be freely critical of the Government but with a sober realistic out- look would be most useful. There was a serious danger of the political education of the people going wrong owing to the absence of a sound and sober press run on independent authority. Canon H. M. Grace agreed with Mr. Hussey that the Churches began the modern educational work in Africa and they brought with it explosive matter because they taught how each individual counted. There was not a great deal to be taught about the tre- mendous need and the growing desire on the part of the people for some say in their education, it was there already. There was not very much that the schools could do to encourage the idea of self-government, it was growing rapidly. He did not think very much could be taught on the techniques of local government, the soul of the people could</page><page sequence="8">EDUCATIONAL POLICY AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT IN AFRICA 79 not be revealed in that way. What concerned him was that the press was probably the most important educational element, it had a terrific effect for good or evil. What worried him was the gap between the older generations and the younger people. People could not be brought in a generation from a pre-feudal system into democracy without great strain and he did not think this problem was adequately tackled. Prophets were needed who could see one step ahead of African opinion and if there was an adequate body of young educated Africans with the best administrators seeing this one step ahead, some guidance could be given as to what should be done next. If this could happen there would not be political agitations which were so unnecessary and which led to worse evils. Major Ney asked what Mr. Hussey meant by "European standards". He had spent many months in Africa recently and had also come from the continent of Europe and he found more happiness in Africa than in Europe. One had to be careful in this matter and face up to the fact that all standards in Europe were on the melting pot. They should have a fairly clear idea of European standards before inflicting them on the people of Africa. Mr. Hussey replied that he was really considering the question of people who had, through education both in school and outside, adopted standards of living of approx- mately the same standard of comfort and so on as the other inhabitants, so that there would not be the extraordinary difference between the standard of living of the African and the European. The fear of the white settler in many places was that a "higher" type of civilisation would be driven out by a "lower", and if the peoples of these countries could adopt a code of life which did provide the same conditions socially and otherwise, he thought there would be a gradual levelling up and it would be possible for them to be on the same political plane as the Europeans. He was not considering the standard of morality. Lady Davson said that one of the difficulties in Africa was the disparity between men and women. To what extent was progress being made in the education of African women ? Had radio been used in this connection ? Mr. Hussey replied that in the Colonies themselves and in the Colonial Office there was a tremendous realisation of the importance of women's and girls' education. The difficulty had always been that it was much easier to get the boys into school and the men into classes but he was given to understand that there was likely to be some special visitation to study the problem in one or two areas. He had not studied how far the radio would help in this problem, but he imagined it would be of great importance. Mr. H. V. L. Swanzy said that Mr. Hussey's assumption that the present content of edu- cation was the one which was necessary was very important, but was it more than an assump- tion ? Our immediate aim was to increase the technical ability of African peoplesmainlyfrom an economic and social standpoint ("development"), but the immediate aim of the people in Africa was primarily political ("freedom"). The more Africans were given technical knowledge, the more they might use it for non-technical ends. The most highly educated African technicians seemed to hold a purely "personal" outlook as a result of their education,' that is to say an anthropomorphic outlook. There was no connecting link between the two conceptions of "freedom" and "development", and until that con- necting link was made through an admittedly difficult re-statement of the content of education, the political problem would only get worse. Mr. Hussey said that there was no one who did not look upon education as a personal thing. It was engaging the attention of everybody in the countries concerned, and he would draw attention to the institution in the Sudan where people were working for this purpose. A similar institution might be started in all the African dependencies. An African asked whether the textbooks used in the African schools and the teaching of history was designed to perpetuate a feeling of inferiority in native peoples or whether the children were taught to have respect for their own tribes and races and given some hope in their own personality. Mr. Hussey said that there was no doubt that the teaching of history was designed to make people proud of their own race and country and there was nowhere that he knew of where that was not one of the main objects of education. The Chairman said that one of the tests of the interest which a lecture had aroused was the discussion which followed and he was sure that Mr. Hussey would be satisfied that he had aroused interest. Mr. Hussey had spoken of the part which education could play in political development and that was why, probably, he had given so much emphasis to the functions of an institute of education which would inculcate citizenship. If there was an institute to teach the responsibilities and duties of citizenship, it would be all to the good, but there was not such an institute even in Europe as yet. Education in citizenship was not a process of school or academic education, it flowed in from a variety</page><page sequence="9">80 AFRICAN AFFAIRS of sources. It would be agreed that such education should be concentrated very largely on the ideal but he and many others would find it difficult to lay down the syllabus to be followed. Education in politics must come from many sources. Sir Bernard Bourdillon had referred to the press and it would be agreed that the situation of the African press was unhappy. Many efforts had been made to improve it without success and that was one of the things which must come from society itself. It was only with the growth of intelligence and information that there would be a good press. An effort was being made to produce a really national spirit amongst the various African peoples, by which he meant not only pride in themselves and self respect, but a constructive spirit which would lead them to make a real effort for their own amelioration, because political progress could not come merely from above. It was a co-operative process in which the African peoples must take part themselves. Why was it that in certain countries great mass movements had succeeded? Could we not find some way of conveying to the African people a similar impulse to that which had moved the Russian or Chinese people ? If this were done all the problems of education and political advance would take a very different aspect. At the moment we were hampered by the lack of such an impulse. He did not know whether it would come from a rising tide of nationalism or from religion but he would like some of the more forward thinking people to help with the problem.</page></plain_text>
