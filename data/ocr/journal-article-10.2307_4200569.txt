FELDMAN** In 671 BCE, Esarhaddon advanced south from the Levant and attacked Egypt, sacking Memphis. About seven years later, in response to repeated Kushite uprisings and following an initial campaign into Lower Egypt, Ashurbanipal's army reinvaded Egypt, marching as far as Thebes where, according to Assyrian accounts, the temples and palaces were looted and their treasures brought back to Nineveh. The Assyrians had been in conflict with Egypt for some time, but these clashes had always taken place in Western Asia, where the two states fought for control and influence over the small Levantine kingdoms. Not until Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal did Assyria penetrate into the heart of Egypt, attacking its two traditional capitals of Memphis and Thebes. This period of intensified antagonism, along with its consequence - increasingly direct contact with Egyptian culture brought into greater focus Assyria's relationship to the Egyptian imperial tradition. I would like to propose here that Assyrian royal ideology, as expressed in art, developed in part out of an awareness of and reaction to the great imperial power of New Kingdom Egypt, in particular that of the Ramesside period of the thirteenth and early twelfth centuries. Indeed, it is more the reaction against Egyptian tradition that seems to have stimulated what we understand as characteristic and distinctive of Assyrian art, but at the same time, even these elements may owe some inspiration to Egypt. In this way, the New Kingdom Egyptian empire served as both precedent and "other" for Assyria, which began to develop its own imperialist ideology during the contemporaneous Middle Assyrian period. To explore some of these ideas in more concrete terms, I would like to examine two very different examples of seventh century royal Assyrian art. The first, from the reign of Esarhaddon, is a rock relief at Nahr el-Kelb in Lebanon (Fig. 2). The second is Ashurbanipal's relief in the Southwest Palace at Nineveh depicting the Battle of Til-Tuba from one of his Elamite campaigns (Figs. 4-6). While these monuments fit within the well-defined developmental sequence of the Neo-Assyrian tradition, each one also exhibits traits that both draw upon and contrast with the imperial predecessor and contemporary antagonist: Egypt. Six Assyrian reliefs join three New Kingdom reliefs of Ramses II and several more recent carvings on the cliffs where the Nahr el-Kelb river empties into the Mediterranean Sea just north of Beirut (Fig. 1).1 Only one of the Assyrian reliefs contains a still-legible inscription, assigning its manufacture to Esarhaddon (Fig. 2). In a 1998 Harvard dissertation, Ann Shafer proposed a possible attribution of two of the most weathered reliefs to the reigns of Shalmaneser III (858-824) and Tiglath-pileser I (11 14 1076).2 She bases this on an inscription of Shalmaneser III in which he claims, "I climbed Mt Lebanon [the Assyrian designation for this area]. I erected an image of my kingship beside the image of Tiglath-pileser, great king, my predecessor",3 as well as on the actual occurrence of Shalmaneser III reliefs alongside one of Tiglath-pileser I at the supposed source of the Tigris river. The other three reliefs remain unattributed. Regardless of attribution, it is clear that the site at the mouth of the Nahr el-Kelb functioned over many centuries as a historical record of imperial presence in the region, beginning as early as the thirteenth century with the Egyptian reliefs of Ramses II. Returning to the one attributable Assyrian relief, that of Esarhaddon, its placement directly * Many stimulating conversations followed the presenta- tion of this paper at the Rencontre, and I would like to thank in particular Allison Thomason and Christoph Uehlinger for their thoughtful comments and suggestions.

In fact, the siting must have carried extra significance since the relief's inscription records Esarhaddon's successful entrance into Memphis, the first time that an Assyrian ruler had campaigned in Egypt proper rather than in Egyptian vassal or allied kingdoms.4 It, like one of the other Assyrian reliefs, was carved immediately abutting an earlier relief of Ramses II that boasts of his successes in the Levant (Figs. 1 and 2). Yet, while the Assyrian relief clearly shares a conceptual basis with its Egyptian neighbour that is, carving a monument to imperial expansion in the living landscape all other formal aspects stand out in striking counterpoint to those of the Egyptian forerunner. The relief is defined by a double, curving border that neatly encloses the large royal figure. Esarhaddon, standing the full height of the relief in a posture of reverence, dominates the scene that also includes divine symbols in the upper field. The cuneiform inscription runs across the entire width of the lower part, superimposed over the body of the king. The relief stands in stark contrast to its neighbouring Egyptian example, which takes the form of an ornately decorated rectangular architectural frame with cavetto cornice, perhaps provoking the unusually pronounced frame of Esarhaddon's relief (Fig. 3).5 The royal figure, accompanied by an anthropomorphic representation of Amun, occupies less than half of the entire relief. Unlike Esarhaddon, who stands immobile and solid, Ramses II, with legs apart and back heel off the groundline, raises one hand to strike a collapsing enemy held captive by the hair in a dynamic scene of victory. The hieroglyphic inscription, now badly effaced, occupies its own space below the figural scene. Each of these reliefs sits squarely within its individual artistic tradition, and thus the form of 'As has been noted by others, for example, Kreppner, 2002, 373; Shater, 1998, 295. 5 Shafer ( 1998, 295, n. 4) notes that Esarhaddon's raised frame is an unusual feature compared to other Assyrian rock reliefs.</page><page sequence="3">NINEVEH TO THEBES AND BACK 143 _a ' n Fig. 2.

Drawing of southernmost Ramses II rock relief, Nahr el-Keib, Lebanon (from Weissbach, 1922. Fig. 6). Esarhaddon's cannot be seen as a direct reaction to the Egyptian. Nonetheless, the Assyrian relief captures and expresses a tension felt in Assyria towards its New Kingdom precedent. On the one hand, Assyria's imperialism and in particular its control of the Levant could be understood as the inheritor of Egypt's imperialism and domination over the Levant during the Late Bronze Age. On the other hand, Assyria's emergence as a military force at the end of the Late Bronze Age, when Egypt was still a major power, developed counter to and in defiance of Egypt. The possibility of a second-millennium Assyrian ruler, Tiglath-pileser I, having erected a relief only two hundred years after Ramses II and in proximity to those of the Egyptian king, suggests that already by the end of the twelfth century, Assyria was defining itself through comparison to and differentiation from Egypt in both ideological and artistic terms, a possibility supported by other material culture of the Middle Assyrian period.' In addition, the potential Tiglath-pileser relief would chart continuity across the divide between the Middle and Late Assyrian traditions, which is further manifested in the consistent interest by later Assyrian kings in maintaining historical links with second-millennium Assyrian rulers. Thus, at Nahr el-Kelb we witness a visual dialogue between the Egyptian and Assyrian representations, as well as one among the Assyrian reliefs themselves, that documents Assyria's relations with Egypt as it constructed its own imperial expression. Ashurbanipal's palace relief depicting the Assyrian army's defeat of Tepti-Huban-Insushnak, called Teumman by the Assyrians, at the battle of Til-Tuba presents a quite different picture from that of Esarhaddon's Nahr el-Kelb relief (Figs. 4-6). Yet it too seems to embody a complex relationship with the New Kingdom royal art tradition. The battle narrative extends over several orthostatsI 11%1%TT 1 thatline Roo XXXIIo thISuhws Palacea Nievh th paac costuce " For example, several items from the burial assemblage of Tomb 45 at Assur (Feldman, 2003).</page><page sequence="4">144 MARIAN H. FELDMAN I _ _ Fig. 4.

The composition, filling the lower part of three orthostats, is one of the most complex in Assyrian art, and has been taken by modern scholars as the culmination of a progressive line of development beginning with the ninth-century reliefs of Ashurnasirpal II at Nimrud. The large-scale unfolding of military action takes place along three groundlines that extend from left to right. As the battle intensifies, the groundlines dissolve, though they are partly maintained in the horizontal positions of various wounded and dead Elamites. To the far right, the Ulai River runs the entire height of the scene, its patterned water filled with the contorted bodies of dead Elamites and their horses. Although this composition in itself is astounding in its complexity, it is further enriched by the specific narrative of Teumman's capture, execution and beheading, which embeds itself within the larger field of battle. And while the episodes of Teumman's plight at first follow the main flow of the battle narrative from left to right, after the critical moment of beheading (Fig. 6), the composition makes a large U-turn and continues from right to left on the register below with the display of Teumman's head to the Elamite troops (Fig. 5). The story of Teumman's head then jumps back to the upper register where it appears twice, moving to the left, held up before an army tent and then carried away in a cart (Fig. 4). Several scholars have remarked upon the similarities of the composition to Egyptian Ramesside battle reliefs, despite the long interval of time and space separating them.7 The great battle scenes of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties that covered large areas of temple walls were an innovation characterizing the final part of the New Kingdom.8 They seem to build upon earlier New Kingdom reliefs that depict events associated with Egypt's expanding presence in Western 7 Kaelin, 1999; Smith, 1965, 147. The similarity, however, does not extend to architectural context, for while the Egyptian reliefs are exclusively found in temple settings, the Assyrian historical narrative reliefs are predominately located in palaces. 8 Heinz, 2001; Gaballa. 1976.</page><page sequence="5">NINEVEH TO THEBES AND BACK 145 Fig. 5.

Asia and the south, such as Hatshepsut's voyage to Punt carved on her funerary monument at Deir el-Bahri and Tuthmose III's annalistic account of his wars in the Levant at Karnak. The striking innovation of the Ramesside rulers was the extensive and detailed representational mode that William Stevenson Smith describes as "historical-narrative elements treated topographically",9 that is, the use of open, topographically rendered spaces in which the historical narrative unfolds along complex compositional lines. Superb examples of such representations are the multiple depictions of the Battle of Qadesh from year 5 of Ramses II's reign, which he had carved on a number of his temples at Abydos, Luxor, Karnak, Thebes, and Abu Simbel.10 Looking at just one scene from this extensive series, from the north tower of the Second Pylon at the Ramesseum in Western Thebes, we see Pharaoh standing alone in his chariot, several times larger than the foe into which he charges (Fig. 7). " Before his onrush, chaos ensues, as the dead bodies and collapsing horses of the enemy are pushed into the Orontes River, which runs vertically down the relief. Though the figure of the king looms far larger than any other participant, in the words of G. A. Gaballa, "what attracts the eye of the viewer is not the dominant figure of the king but the panoramic representation of the battle".12 This scene bears a striking resemblance in its compositional elements, if not its specifics of rendering, to Ashurbanipal's Til-Tuba relief in which the Assyrian army rushes against a mass of Elamite soldiers, the organized groundlines giving way to the chaos of defeat culminating at the River Ulai filled with dead bodies. By the seventh century, a long history of direct contact between Assyria and Egypt stretched back to the Late Bronze Age, when Middle Assyrian rulers rose to prominence within an international arena in which Egyptian kings played a dominant role. And so it seems not unreason- 9Smith, 1965, 176; also Heinz, 2001, 127, 205. '0Heinz, 2001, 126-48. l On the western side, facing into the second court. Wreszinski, 1988, Pls. 100 and 101.

Certainly in the Late Bronze Age period a form of royal ideology and imagery was shared among the kingdoms of the eastern Mediterranean and Near East.'3 However, even in the Late Bronze Age, Assyria seems to have played by slightly different rules, perhaps reacting to its own difficulties in finding acceptance among the international community of Great Kings, as expressed in letters from the Amarna and Hattusa archives. All the major powers of the Late Bronze Age harboured imperialist longings, specifically territorial acquisition that brought access to wealth in a variety of forms, including booty and tribute. But a balance of power existed because no one state could prevail, ensnaring them all in a diplomatic network of reciprocal exchanges founded on the rhetoric of parity and brotherhood.14 Assyria, emerging from its vassal status in the mid-fourteenth century, was a late-comer to this international club. Ashur-uballit 1 (1363-1328), corresponding with the Egyptian king, is the first Assyrian ruler to call himself "king of the land of Ashur", rather than the less exalted, "vice- regent of (the god) Ashur". He also calls himself "Great King", positioning himself as equal to the already established major powers of the time Egypt, Babylonia and Hatti. His aspirations, however, did not go unchallenged, as the Babylonian king, Burna-Buriash, attempted to block "3See, for example, Feldman, 2002, 17-24. 14See, for example, Cohen and Westbrook (eds.), 2000; Liverani, 1990.</page><page sequence="7">NINEVEH TO THEBES AND BACK 147 Fig. 7. The Battle of Qadesh, Second Pylon, Ramesseum (after Wreszinski, 1988. P1. 101). Assyria from international diplomacy by writing to the Egyptian king, "Now, as for my Assyrian vassals, I was not the one who sent them to you. Why on their own authority have they come to your country? If you love me, they will conduct no business whatsoever. Send them off to me empty-handed."15 Over fifty years later, a thirteenth-century Hittite-language draft of a letter probably sent to Adad-nirari I ( 1305-1274) continues to rebuff Assyrian pretensions and also indicates that by this time Assyria had adopted a strategy of self-representation based on military success rather than brotherly actions. You continue to speak about [the defeat?] of Wasashatta [and the conquest?] of the land of Hurri. You indeed conquered by force of arms. ... and have become a Great King. But why do you continue to speak about brotherhood ...? On what account should I write to you about brotherhood? Were you and I born from one mother?'" It is during this formative Middle Assyrian period that the seeds of the later imperialist image were planted, which would develop, with refinements and enlargements, through the first millen- nium. Moreover, to some extent, Egypt helped fertilize this early germination. Imagery such as that of a man in a chariot hunting ibex found on twelfth-century sealings from Assur exhibits close parallels with New Kingdom Egyptian hunting and battle scenes, as well as compositional affinities with the much later and more complex Battle of Til-Tuba.'7 As Holly Pittman has noted, "In order to understand the development of historical narrative so important to the expression of Neo-Assyrian imperial identity, it is imperative to evaluate the impact of these artistic developments [that is, New Kingdom historical reliefs] in Egypt."'18 Furthermore, this Assyrian royal "image", even within the international arena, was one based on military might and territorial expansion, eventually displacing the rhetoric of diplomacy and brotherhood that marked interactions between the Great Powers. While other Great Kings might boast about their war exploits to internal audiences, they communicated with one another in terms of brotherly love. Assyria, however, appears to have asserted its military standing even among its international peers, provoking the kind of contemptuous response from the Hittites quoted above. The increasing emphasis on military dominance found forceful expression in the actions of Tukulti-Ninurta I (1243-1207) who, at the end of the thirteenth century, violently attacked Babylonia, an event that was glorified in epic poetry as particularly destructive and awe-inspiring. Such literary depictions of conquest are paralleled in the artistic realm of thirteenth- and twelfth- 15 EA 9, translation by Moran, 1992.

FELDMAN century glyptic in the increasing number of combative themes between heroic figures and mytho- logical or real animals."9 Thus, we see already in the thirteenth century a careful construction of imperial self-representation by the Assyrian kings. The two seventh-century royal representations on which this paper focuses come at the end of this process, a process that I want to emphasize was neither simple nor strictly linear. Esarhaddon's rock relief at Nahr el-Kelb draws upon a tradition of Assyrian rock reliefs carved throughout its lands that dates back at least to the period of Tiglath-pileser I at the end of the twelfth century.20 Where this tradition originated is difficult to pinpoint. Closest to the Assyrian heartland are the reliefs carved in the cliffs of the Zagros mountains just to the east of Assyria by various indigenous tribal entities.2' These date to the end of the third millennium and the beginning of the second, significantly earlier than the first known Assyrian rock reliefs.22 Nearer in time are reliefs by both the Hittites and the Egyptians. Examples of Hittite carved rock reliefs dot the Anatolian landscape, but the closest to Assyria is an early thirteenth-century relief of Muwatalli at Sirkeli near Adana in Cilicia.3 Ramses II had several other reliefs, in addition to those at the Nahr el-Kelb, carved in the southern Levantine area, including one just south of Sidon.24 However, the cluster of three Egyptian reliefs at Nahr el-Kelb is reminiscent of a series of carved reliefs and shrines that line the steep cliffs along the Nile at Gebel el Silsila.5 Sixty-five kilometers north of Aswan, where the narrowing of the river forms a natural boundary with Nubia, Ramses II joined several earlier New Kingdom rulers and officials in dedicating a stele framed by an architectural portico carved into the living rock. If one of the reliefs at Nahr el-Kelb can be attributed to Tiglath-pileser I, its physical proximity to the Ramses II reliefs may indicate that the Egyptian tradition provided one possible model for the later Assyrian tradition. While the strong contrast between almost every single formal element in the Egyptian and Assyrian reliefs is purely coincid- ental, nonetheless, this contrast appears to have been deftly exploited by the Assyrians who chose to place their reliefs in the vicinity of, and in two instances including that of Esarhaddon, directly abutting the Egyptian reliefs. In this way, they call attention to their position as both inheritors and supplanters of the Egyptian tradition. Moving from Assyria's periphery to its capital, Ashurbanipal's palace relief presents a more complicated attestation of the complex relationship of art and politics between Assyria and Egypt. The Til-Tuba battle scene, probably carved sometime between 660 and 650, may have derived its elaborate and unique composition from direct exposure to the great battle reliefs of Seti I, Ramses II and Ramses III that adorn the walls of the very temples that Ashurbanipal boasts about sacking and looting only a few years earlier.26 If so, we might postulate two trajectories of Egyptian stimulus: one going back to contact during the Late Bronze Age that developed over time through the Middle Assyrian and early Neo-Assyrian periods, as indicated by such objects as the twelfth- century seal impression from Assur; the other stemming from the more immediate contact of conquest and looting that occurred during Ashurbanipal's campaign against Thebes. Certainly, during Ashurbanipal's reign, the memory of Egypt's past imperialism persisted in the rhetoric of the contemporary Kushite rulers. It was physically present in the still-standing structures of the New Kingdom Pharaohs that the Assyrian army encountered. And it survived in histories that later provided the foundation for Manetho's dynastic reconstruction in the Ptolemaic period. I would like to make clear, however, that I am not arguing for any simple process of "direct influences" from New Kingdom Egypt to first-millennium Assyrian art, although there was ample opportunity during the seventh-century Assyrian campaigns in Egypt for exposure to earlier Egyptian art, and many Egyptian artifacts have been recovered from the excavations at Nineveh.27 Rather, I am suggesting that Assyrian rulers structured their expression of kingship, at least to "9Pittman, 1996, 350 20Kreppner, 2002; Colbow, 2000; Shafer, 1998. 21 BMrker-KlAihn, 1982, Nos. 29-34. 22There are some Assyrian reliefs in the general area of the earlier Zagros reliefs, but they date from the later Neo- Assyrian period, well after the establishment of the monu- ment form (one of Shalmaneser III is known from a textual reference only, the rest date to Tiglath-pileser III or later). 23Bittel, 1976, Fig. 195. 24 Porter and Moss, 1952, Vol.VII, 383. 25 Kitchen, 1993a, 69-77; Kitchen, 1993b, 70-80; "Gebel es-Silsile," in Lexikon der Agyptologie 9/11/1, 441-7; Barguet, 1952. 26As suggested by Kaelin, 1999. 27 Including fragments of three statues of the Kushite ruler Taharqa found in Esarhaddon's military arsenal at Nineveh (Thomason, 2004; Russell, 1998, 241, P1. 230).</page><page sequence="9">NINEVEH TO THEBES AND BACK 149 some degree, in comparison with Egyptian royal expression. This process of constructed identity had its wellspring in the formative Middle Assyrian period, when Egypt was a preeminent power, and was then reinforced and refined over time, and by later contacts with Egypt. Moreover, I contend that the Egyptian artistic stimuli were considered by the Assyrian rulers, both positively and negatively, through a highly politicised lens. Egypt, as a great imperial presence in Westem Asia, was something to be emulated and admired. But Egypt, as antagonist to Assyria's growing empire, was something to be opposed and distinguished from. Both the Nahr el-Kelb rock reliefs and the Battle of Til-Tuba, through their forms, compositions, and even geographical situations, boldly proclaimed Assyria's unique and independent imperial vision; yet, at the same time, they stood upon the shoulders of a giant: the empire of New Kingdom Egypt.
