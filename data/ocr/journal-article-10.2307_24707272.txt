<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARISTOTLE ON ΜΥΤΗ AND PHILOSOPHY* by Α. Ρ. BOS In this paper we intend to deal with Aristotle's philosophical évaluation of myth. Only against this background will it be possible, in our view, to judge the use of mythical themes by the same philosopher in the frag mentary remains of some of his so-called exoteric works. This enquiry into Aristotle's position will be preceded by an exposition of our own point of view with regard to the troublesome question of the relation between myth and philosophy. 1. Myth and philosophy Throughout the âges philosophy has exhorted people to self-know ledge. It never ceased appealing to them to penetrate through the mist of the phénoménal world and reach true insight in their own situation. Those who wished to gain access to true knowledge had to start taking seriously the call of the Delphic oracle: 'Know yourself, become aware of your limitations and the finitude of your possibilities. But the mirror which philosophy holds out to those willing to look can also be directed towards itself. The question might be raised: what is the situation with regard to the self-knowledge of philosophy itself? Did philosophers right from the beginning reflect on their own philosophical activity? Did they realize that there might be a limit to the scope of philosophy? If these questions are examined in relation to the period of ancient philosophy, it must be concluded that philosophy demonstrated self-awareness and a sense of its own worth much earlier than it showed explicit self-reflection. Already in the lively discussions and at times violenüy polemical alter cations that took place in the fïrst phase of philosophical activity, there grew a steadily stronger perception of philosophy's own nature and the methods with which it deals with reality. In the case of the oldest philo sophers we observe a critical attitude which repeatedly leads to devasta ting judgments on contemporaries and thinkers of earlier times. Their targets fall into two groups. They assail those whom we would rank as philosophers. But there are also attacks on and discussions with men who * In writing this paper I have much profïted from discussion with Dr. D. Th. Bunia. He was also responsible for the translation.

Although some none-too-subtle disqualifïcatory judgments 011 earlier thinkers have been recorded — Heraclitus discounted people like Pythagoras as 'knowalls',1 while Parmenides declared all men without exception to be 'know nothings'2 - on the whole it would seem that discussion and communica tion with these thinkers is maintained. When, however, philosophers corne across a world-orientation with a mythical character, communica tion repeatedly appears to break down. Xenophanes is the fïrst, with Plato following in his footsteps, to draw the ultimate conclusion that the old narrators of myth such as Hesiod and Homer should be prevented from reaching the public with their products. Even after a cursory acquaintance with Greek myth and Greek philo sophy, however, the observer is struck by the fact that both these tradi tions aim to supply the same market. They both claim to present a view of the world and man's place in it. Both give expression to an attempt to orientate man in the world in which he lives and give him a sense of direction in his everyday existence. In order to achieve this aim both view the empirical world against the background of a total perspective, and in doing so they cannot help but overstep the limits of daily experience. But in the means used to fulfïl this aim great différences emerge. How otherwise can we explain the none-too-subtle accusations that were thrown back and forth, the charges of 'superstition', 'bamboozlement', 'trumpery', 'opium of the people' on the one hand, the charges of'atheism' and 'anti-religious sentiment' on the other? How can this différence be characterized? The well-known English scholar J. Burnet gave a clear and resolute answer. True philosophy is marked by its 'scientific' and 'rational' nature.3 Myth and the religious notions of the common man lack this characteristic, and so remain ens nared in tradition and superstition. Bumet is convinced that, if the con trast between these two approaches is fully understood, mistaken at tempts will no longer be made to locate the origin of Greek philosophy in the mythical worldview.4 This answer possesses the lucidity and fïrmness which we have corne to expect from the exponents of modem Positivism. With confidence they assure us that, as soon as the new light of reason has appeared, the old mythical-theological orientation loses ail relevance. The persuasiveness of this approach, however, is considerably reduced when it is perceived that the unity of science and reason as propounded by Positivism only exists by virtue of the acceptance of the positivistic method: that is to say, one can only hope to reach unanimity and universal validity in the domain of science if one goes along with the positivists in their déclaration of what may be considered 'scientific' and what not. 'Objectivity' is here based on 'subjective' conventions. It is hardly surpri sing that in recent times many voices of protest have been raised against this position. The viewpoint that philosophy should be seen against the background 1 Heraclitus, D.K. 22B 40, cf. 22B 8. 2 Parmenides, D.K. 28B 6.4. 3 J.

Cornford cited in our following note).</page><page sequence="3">of mythical thought has been defended by F. M. Cornford in his book From Religion to Philosophy.s In the area of Greek religion he makes the distinction between the Olympian and Dionysian forms of religion. The same contrast, in his view, returns in an analogous form in what he considers to be the two main divisions of Greek philosophy, the 'scienti fïc' and the 'mystical' type.6 Although Cornford agrees that philosophy as such is non-religious, it does in his opinion adopt and adapt a number of pre-philosophical presuppositions and catégories of thought which be long to the mythical worldview.7 An eminent pupil of the last-named author, W. K. C. Guthrie, when dealing with the beginnings of Greek philosophy,-afïïrms that mythical ways of thinking are rejected and reli gious faith is replaced by a faith that functions as the basis of scientifïc thought.8 This position, in as far as it accepts an intrinsical relation between scientific thought and a kind of faith, we wish to use as our point of departure in an attempt to shed more light on the similarities and dif férences between myth and philosophy. For our present purposes it will be sufficiënt to describe myth9 as a 'product of man's imagination which is guided by faith and aims at coming to terms with human experience'. The framers of the old myths recorded their own expériences and the ex periential tradition of their people in the form of stories which place those expériences in an all-embracing framework. In so doing they gave expres sion to their récognition of the meaning of these expériences. The création of myth is a process in which meaning is conferred because meaning is recognized. Récognition of meaning in the sense intended here is a form of faith. We are convinced that as such it belongs to the fundamental structure of human existence. Récognition of meaning is thus the essential pre-condition for the création of myth. But at the same time an important rôle must be assigned to the creative imagination of man in the way it is given expression. The assumption is warranted that in ail myths there is a direct relation to the experiential world of the indivi dual or people involved. But the same kind of experience (for example, the fact that life goes on while individuals perish) can lead to very dif ferent forms of mythical représentation (the abduction of Proserpina; the 5 F. M. Comford 1912 v: 'There is a real continuity between the earliest rational spécula tion and the religious représentation that lay behind it\ 6 Op. cit. vii, 139. 7 Op. cit. 135. It should be noted that Cornford dérivés religion from social pattems: 'Behind philosophy lies religion; behind religion as we now see, lies social custom - the structure and institutions of the human group' (54, cf. 87). ' W. K. C. Guthrie 1962 I 29: 'For religious faith there is substituted a faith that was and remains the basis of scientific thought with ail its triumphs and ail its limitations: that is, the faith that the visible world conceals a rational and intelligible order, that the causes of the natural world are to be sought within its boundaries, and that autonomous human reason is our sole and sufficiënt instrument for the search.' ® Cf. W. Burkert, Griechische Religion (Stuttgart 1977) 193 who gives as his définition of myth: "... ein Komplex von Erzâhlungen ... in dem die menschlich einleuchtende Schemata in phantastischen Kombinationen zu einem vielschichtigen Zeichensystem zu sammentreffen, das in wechselnder Weise zur Erhellung der Wirklichkeit angewandt wird ...'

Burkert, 1970 1-2, 13-16.</page><page sequence="4">king of the New Year; the various manifestations of the moon-goddess and so on). The creative imagination given expression in myths stands in marked contrast to the logical cohérence and internai consistency which becomes more and more the hallmark of philosophical treatises, especially after Parmenides of Elea had drawn attention to it in such an explicit manner.10 The way of the logos does not go haphazardly in ail directions, but is absolutely straight and unswerving. From this time onwards the structure of the ideal philosophical discourse is characterized by sequences of logical necessity. The crucial question posed by the rise of the tradition of the logos is now: does it replace the mythical mode of orientation completely or only in a limited area? Is it possible to entrust to logical analysis and reasoning the task of indicating and recognizing meaning in the manner that we described as a basic structural element of human existence? This seems to be asking too much from man's reasoning activity. One might question whether it is correct to regard logical cohérence and creative imagination as mutually exclusive and place them in such marked opposition to each other. To our mind the irreducible diversity of the various philosophical traditions is convincing proof that this view cannot be sustained. Cer tainly it is characteristic of the philosophical tradition that it utilizes networks of strict logical relation within the Systems of explanation which it constructs, that it endeavours to dérivé conclusions from premisses according to fïxed rules, and that there is a continuai effort to remove all traces of internai inconsistency. In myth such aims play no role of any importance. The chief aim of myths is to attract and maintain the attention of the listener by being plausible and convincing, and so they require entirely different characteristics. But also the person engaged in philo sophical or scientifïc activity cannot help but give his existence and activity meaning (in a never-ending effort to discover the meaning of reality!) by placing it in an all-embracing framework which structurally transcends actual experience. This is the case when Anaximander regards the empirical world as totally polarized and places it against the back ground of the Apeiron, the principle anterior to all polarization. Likewise when Aristotle describes the Erös of the entire Physis striving after the perfection of the deity as the motor and motivation of all that takes place in the empirical world. We conclude this discussion by formulating our provisional viewpoint as follows: it is inherent in man's nature to place his expériences in a total framework which renders them meaningful. This framework is transcen dental-empirical in nature and belongs to the pistic dimension of human existence. In the archaic period it was the poets of myths who attempted to give this framework concrete expression in such a way that it could be 10 This is not to say that logica] coherence is wholly absent from mythical présentations. When Kronos is warned by his father Ouranos that he will pay the penalty for his offence, his attempt to prevent that punishment being carried out is perfectly reasonable. The children of his wife Rhea, whom he immediately swallows after every birth, remain unharmed in his intestines until Zeus is old and large enough to initiate the battle with his father Kronos and the Titans. This is typical of the way that myth breaks through the limits imposed by human experience.</page><page sequence="5">passed on to others. When philosophy makes its fïrst appearance in Greece in the sixth century B.C. the same endeavour to formulate a framework for human experience can be observed as in the case of the mythicizing poets. The différence between the two lies in the attempt of the philosophers to create a strictly logical consistency between prémis ses and conclusions as replacement for the créative imagination of the old poets. The poets of myth propagated with the methods of the poetic imagination the meaning of the reality in which they lived. The philoso phers can be typifïed as people who claim to furnish an argumentation for the worldview in which they believe and who use that argumentation in order to make their conviction more persuasive. It is important to note here that the ordering of the data of experience in terms of strict rules of logic stands in a secondary relation to the ex perience as such, which is already structurally controlled and determined by the total framework of meaning in which it is placed. (This could be compared with the way in which the perception of a concrete object is co-determined by its environment and background (which are them selves not the objects of the act of perception), and also by the manner in which the percipient has been trained in perceiving. In the same way the process of acquiring knowledge is directed by paradigmas, frameworks of meaning, which are themselves not product of that process). For this reason it is inadmissible that the results of philosophical activity should be exclusively judged on the basis of their analytical power and logical systematization. It is only the ordering of the results of the philosophical reflection that takes place with the assistance of the instruments which science and reason have at their disposai and which replace the instru ments of the poets. Man's encounter with the empirical world and the framework of meaning which gives it structure are themselves not logical or rational in nature. This conclusion we think justitïed on the basis of the results of the many centuries of philosophical debate. It does not mean, however, that the first philosophers had a clear perception of such a relation between the my thical world-orientation and the philosophical world-orientation with its use of scientific and rational methods. It is therefore important to make a careful examination of what the viewpoints of the earliest thinkers were on this issue. Our attention must be focussed on the question of whether in their criticism of the authors of myth they chiefly meant to criticize and replace the instruments and methods used in the présentation of their world-orientation (1), or that they made the claim that philosophy offers a path and method to an alternative ffamework of meaning which was itself considered to possess an exclusively logical character (2). Perhaps we might suspect that in the case of Xenophanes of Colophon (sixth century B.C.) the sharp criticism of Homeric and Hesiodic theology represents no more than position (1). It is only when Parmenides enters the field that the conditions required for the further step to position (2) are fulfilled. No other source of knowledge than the logos is considered by him acceptable any more. So it becomes understandable that Plato too not only regards the method oflogoi as the only reliable instrument for the formulation of one's orientation in reality, but furthermore considers the actual frame work which gives meaning to that experiential reality to be logical in</page><page sequence="6">nature. In his oeuvre the traditional mythical forms of orientation are radically rejected. On the other hand it is well-known that he himself makes use of the possibilities and techniques of myth in a singularly impressive manner. The question of what signifïcance and fonction these myths possess in Plato's work is highly controversial and has given rise to diverse answers." We shall not directly concern ourselves with it, but now focus our attention on the problem of how his pupil Aristotle concei ved the relation between myth and philosophy. 2. Aristotle on myth and philosophy Also in the writings of Aristotle there are numerous references to my thical figures. Sometimes these references are rather incidental, such as those to Oceanus and Thetys, Chaos and Night, the theme of the succes sion of the gods, Atlas, Ixion, Phaëton, Endymion. In one of his lost works, the dialogue Eudemus, a story was presented of the encounter between king Midas and the demi-god Silenus. It has moreover been suggested thàt Aristotle brought this work to a conclusion with a myth in Platonic style aboutthe island of Kronos.12 Well-known is the remark (presumably made in a letter): 'Now that I am leading a more alone and solitary existence I have become more philomuthos'. It has often been un derstood as meaning that, when Aristotle was deprived of his normal activities as a teacher in the Peripatos and supervisor of the research projects undertaken there, he took recourse to the company of his books and turned with some eagerness to works fforn the mythical tradition.13 Certainly diverse passages make it quite clear that Aristotle adopts a critical attitude to the old poets of myth. A good example of this is the criticism which he levels at Hesiod and others who composed poems about the gods. These people were only concerned with what they them selves considered plausible and did not take into account people like himself who are not satisfied with easy answers. The ancients supposed that the distinction between gods and mortals could be explained by pointing to the nectar and ambrosia, which are the food and drink of the gods but not accessible to mortal beings. They put forward this explana tion as if it was quite clear to them what 'nectar' and 'ambrosia' actually stand for. Such 'mythical wisdom' cannot be taken as seriously, in Aris totle's opinion, as the views of those who supply arguments and proofs for what they say.14 Elsewhere he observes that the strength of myth lies especially in the positive effect it has on the common man.

Plezia, Aristotelis Epistularum Fragmenta (Warschau 1961) 121-123 and takes φιλόμυθος in this context to mean 'talkative': '... desto redseliger bin ich'; (Düring 1966 14-15 &amp; η. 81); cf. Ε.Ν.

If it is true that Aristotle shows both a critical and a more positive attitude towards myth, it is our task now to proceed and determine the weight he gives to both attitudes. In this task we shall have to subject to close scrutiny the remarkable statement found in the first book of the Metaphysics that 'a lover of myth (philomuthos) is in a sense a lover of wisdom (philosophos)'.16 In this passage too Aristotle clearly envisages points of similarity and significant différences between myth and philo sophy. Nevertheless his statement, if examined carefully, contains a number of aspects which might make us wonder. The context of the sentence is well-known. Aristotle introducés the science of philosophy and relates it to tfte universal human desire tor knowledge." Philosophy is in his view a special form of that human striving for knowledge. It directs the attention of its disciples to the most fundamental and ultimate principles by which the mysteries of the universe and of human existence are to be explained. This means that it even tries to gain insight into the driving force behind its own desire for knowledge. Here surely Aristotle is making a very serious attempt to gain self-knowledge!18 He is at pains to emphasize the différence between philosophical activity and the productive sciences. The latter are motivated by desire of a different kind, namely desire for the possession and enjoyment of material things, or, in more général terms, desire to provide the primary necessities of life and to satisfy feelings of greed. Desire is thus a motiva ting force which manifests itself at various levels and in various guises. The desire for produced goods can be considered a striving to eliminate a 'deficit' on the material level. Philosophy, resulting firom the desire for knowledge, sets itself the task of overcoming the deficit on the spiritual level. In this context Aristotle introducés the theme of wonder (thaumazein). It is the spiritual condition of someone who has perceived his own ig norance19 and has reached the stage that he is no longer satisfied to remain in that state. Wonder apparently has to do with the boundary between knowledge and unknown territory. The larger the 'known territory' be comes, the greater the sphere of things which can arouse wonder. This applies both to an individual person and to a culture (as a community of people who exchange and transmit expériences to each other). Aristotle gives an example of how the boundary of knowledge (including the 15 Metaph./1 8 1074a38-bl4. " Metaph.A 2 982bl8 ό φιλόμυθος φιλόσοφος πώς έστιν. 17 Ibid. A 1 980a20. " It is revealing that according to Aristotle's exposition in the first two chapters of the Metaphysics, knowledge of man's telos, i.e. that which ultimately motivâtes him, coïncides with knowledge concerning God and the knowledge possessed by God! This knowledge is at the same time the attainment of the goal of human existence. " Metaph.A 2 982bl2, b!7.</page><page sequence="8">boundary of wonder) of a culture shifts .First people are perplexed at what is found in the area of what lies 'close at hand'. After that they begin to ask questions about the various phases of the moon, the circuits and éclipsés of the sun, the movements of the stars, the genesis of the entire universe.20 The first mentioned category of things which arouse wonder are denoted as ta procheira tón atopön.21 That might give the impression that the différence between the two groups of questions lies in their degree of difïiculty. In what follows, however, we shall present arguments which make it probable that the contrast is intended between problems oc curring in a sphere that lies 'within man's reach' as it were, and those in another sphere on which man has much less 'grip', e.g. the area of the celestial Dhenomena. It would seem legitimate to connect such a shifting of the 'boundary of wonder' with that of the 'boundary of admiration' which Aristotle men tions a little earlier on.22 The honorific title of'wise man' has always been given to pioneers, people who are able to expand the territory of know ledge. Also in this area progress can be clearly observed. The fïrst are those who have made discoveries in the sphere of the necessities of life and the maintenance of the body. Next are those discoveries which provi de man with pleasure and récréation. There follows a third category of skills which can only be developed in a situation where a section of the populace is freed from the obligation to participate in the hurly-burly of economie life. As an example Aristotle cites the priesdy class of Egypt and their discoveries in the area of the mathematical sciences. We may be quite sure that it is not the applied mathematics of the surveyors that Aristotle has in mind here, but rather the discoveries made in the area of pure theoretical mathematics. Moreover he will certainly have regarded the scientifïc activity of the Egyptian priests as being an intégral part of their worship of the gods (especially the celestial gods). For this reason it is especially the science of astronomy that we must think of in this context.23 Aristotle's account is very concise. Clearly he assumes that his readers are familiar with the theme of the graduai development of civili zation referred to in this passage. This must give rise to the suspicion that he has dealt with the theme in greater detail elsewhere. It is not unreaso nable, therefore, that some scholars regard a text in Philoponus as having preserved traces of such a detailed discussion,24 even if the transmission 20 Ibid. 982bl4-17. 21 Ibid. 982bl3. 22 Ibid. 1 981bl3-25: 'It is therefore probable that at first the inventor of any art which went further than the ordinary sensations was admired by his fellow-men, not merely because some of his inventions were useful, but as being a wise and superior person. And as more and more arts were discovered, some relating to the necessities and some to the pastimes of life, the inventors of the latter were always considered wiser than those of the former, because their branches of knowledge did not aim at utility. Hence when all the discoveries of this kind were fully developed, the sciences which relate neither to pleasure nor yet to the necessities of life were invented, and first in those places where man had leisure. Thus the mathematical sciences originated in the neighbourhood of Egypt, because there the priestly class was allowed leisure.' (translation H. Tredennick LCL). 23 Cf. Metaph. A 1 981b 19 rô μη προς χρήσιν, the second and (by implication) third category of human arts do not aim at practical utility. Cf. Diogenes Laërtius 111. 24 Philoponus in Nicomach. Isagogèn I 1, included by W. D. Ross, Aristotelis Fragmenta Selecta, among the texts pertaining to the lost work De Philosophia (8b). Cf. G. Verbeke 1961</page><page sequence="9">must have been very indirect.25 In this text fïve stages in the development of a civilization are distin guished. The first is the making of discoveries which are important for the provision of food (1). As examples the mill-stone and the art of agriculture are mentioned. The next stage involves discoveries and inventions which make life more pleasant and culturally refïned (2). Then follows the development of skills and sciences which do not fall under the first two headings. These are subdivided into législative activity (3) and the study of natural science (4).26 The climax is formed by knowledge of the divine, supra-cosmic and totally immutable entities (5).27 Nothing in this des cription of cultural development compels us to regard it as un-Aristote lian. To the contrary, in a recent article Ε. Martineau28 has revived the viewpoint that also in the De Caelo, which is commonly regarded as a very early work, Aristotle accepted the existence of meta-cosmic entities outside the région of the fifth element. The fïfth element is as substance ametablêton (unchangeable), but at the same time it remains in con tinuous motion, i.e. in everlasting change of place. Above this level Aristotle found it necessary to postulate the existence of entities which are to be conceived as wholly ametablëta. It seems to us not impossible that Aristotle considered his teacher Plato to have been the first to make the advance firom stage (4) to the knowledge of category (5), because he first anchored the entire world of nature in a meta-physical reality. Moreover we think it probable that Aristotle regar ded the development of astronomical science and the systematic interest in celestial phenomena as the décisive preparatory step precisely because, according to Plato, it is in the heavens that the existence of a supreme, meta-cosmic divinity is most clearly made apparent.29 This basic con viction was already explicitly stated by Plato in the Republic (in the com parison of the Idea of the Good with the Sun30) and is further elaborated in the description of the World-soul and the 'visible gods' in the Timaeus.31 426-7, W.

He shows that we may not conclude that Philoponus gives an explicit reference to a lost Aristotelian work (340). Nonetheless he recognized the 'zweifellos stark aristotelischen Charakterder Entwicklungstheorie des Aristokles' (se. of Messene) which is present in the passage cited above (329) and admits that its source needs to be further researched (340).

The lover of myth and the lover of wisdom It is time to return to the text of the first chapters of the Metaphysics. First we observe the noteworthy fact that Aristotle uses the same word thaumazein to express the concepts of'wonder' and 'admiration'.32 Ad miration is accorded to those discoverers, inventors or legislators who make a contribution, first to the improvement of living conditions, and later on to the advancement of knowledge and the removal of ignorance. Before this can take place, however, it is necessary that these 'pioneers' themselves realize the shortcomings in food production, social organiza tion and the fund of human knowledge. The thauma which takes posses sion of them is proportional to the size of the chasm which they observe between their own problematic situation and the idéal situation in which the problem in question has been solved. The awareness of a shortcoming is, it would seem, the foundation for all activity, including all scientifïc and philosophical activity. We shall now examine how Aristotle fits the mythical tradition into this train of thought and évaluâtes it. We do this by asking ourselves what he precisely meant in the short and seemingly simple sentence: "the lover of myth (philo muthos) is in a sense a lover of wisdom (philosophos), for myth consists of thaumasia".33 Three questions spring to mind in relation to this passage: (a) what kind of people are indicated by Aristotle with the term 'philo muthos'? (b) what is meant by the thaumasia outoi which myth is said to consistr (c) what precisely is the point of agreement between the lover of myth and the philosopher? Το the fïrst question three answers can be given: ( 1) philomuthos could be taken to indicate someone who, as a resuit of his interest in philosophy and culture, makes a study of the myths handed down from earlier times. One thinks of the text cited above34 in which Aristotle calls himself philomuthoteros (in the interprétation until recently generally accepted). (2) Secondly we might think of the man in the street, the average Greek, whose world-orientation is still dominated by the mythical traditions of his people, and who listens eagerly and attentively to the recital of the works of Homer and Hesiod and the Orphie theologians. (3) A final possibility remains, namely that he means the persons who actually devi se myth, the mythicizing poets. A glance at the context will show that the first alternative must be ruled out. The man who shows a scientific interest in myth will not be called by Aristotle a 'philosopher in a certain sense'.35 The choice between the second and the third meaning we will postpone until we have discussed the next question. In the second place, what can be meant by thaumasia? To answer this 32 Metaph. A 1 981bl4 and 982bl2. Both meanings of the word are found in one text at Mech. I 847a 11 : θαυμάζεται τών μέν κατά φύσιν συμβαινόντων, όσων άγνοε'ιται τό αίτιον, τών όε παρά φύσιν, όσα γίνεται όιά τέχνη ν πρός τό συμφέρον τοις άνθρώποις. 33 Metaph. Α 2 982bl8 (text W. Jaeger): διό και ό φιλόμνθος φιλόσοφος πώς έατιν ό γόρ μύθος σύγκειται έκ θαυμάσιων. 34 Cf. η. 13. 35 Equally unlikely is that Aristotle has the philosophical myths of Plato in mind, a possibility left open by I.

In the latter instance it describes 'wondrous tales', and 'wond rous' here may well have the connotation 'difïicult to believe'. In this way the term is used in the title of the treatise De Mirabilibus Auscultationi bus.i6 Whenever the distance in time and cultural development between the old myths and the listening or reading public has become great, an old myth can give the impression that it consists of 'wondrous tales' which cannot be granted any credibility. But it is no more likely that Aristotle should regard someone who swallows tales of iron-munching mice un digested as a 'philosopher in a certain sense' than that J. Bumet should promote to a 'scientist in a certain sense' someone who allows his daily movements to be determined by the horoscope that he reads in his morning newspaper. In our text thaumasia must be meant to refer to phenomena or occurrences possessing an objective character which give rise to thauma in the hearts of those whose attention is directed to them.37 They form the basic material for the myth-creating activity. On the basis of this considération the conclusion follows that the term philomuthos must apply to the creator of myth, the mythicizing poet. A paraphrase of the sentence with which we are concerned could thus be: 'therefore also the poet of myth is in a certain sense a philosopher; for myth dérivés its material from things which arouse wonder'. 4. The point of similarity between the poet of myth and the philosopher One question remains: what is the point of similarity between the poet of myth and the philosopher to which Aristotle wishes to draw attention? W. D. Ross has answered this question as follows: 'The argument is: Myth is full of things that excite wonder. He who wonders thinks he is ignorant. He who thinks he is ignorant desires knowledge. Therefore the lover of myth is a lover of know ledge'.38 This explanation could be misleading in as much as it might give the impression that the wondrous aspects of mythical accounts could lead the 36 Περι θαυμάσιων άκουαμάτων. This work is generally regarded as unAristotelian. In ch. 25 it is reported without comment that there is a tradition which déclarés that on Cyprus mice consume iron as food. In ch. 101 a case of reanimation is described. The author comments that it seems 'too mythical' but that he nevertheless feit he should not leave it out. 37 Cf. E. Rolfes,Aristoteles' Metaphysik, übers. und erlâutert (Leipzig 1920) 5: 'Daher ist auch der Freund der Sage in gewissem Sinne ein Philosoph, denn die Sage hat das Wun derbare zum Inhalte'. W. D. Ross, The Works of Aristotle vol. VIII (Oxford 19282): '(Whence even the lover of myth is in a sense a lover of wisdom, for the myth is composed of wonders)'. H. de Ley, Aristoteles, Metaphysica A (Baam 1977): '(daarom is ook de mythenvriend in zekere zin wijsgeer; de mythe bestaat immers uit wonderbaarlijke dingen)'. G. Reale, Aristotele: La metafisica 2 vols. (Napoli 1968) follows W. D. Ross in his version: 'il mito, infatti, è costituito da un insieme di cose che destano meraviglia'; see also his comment 146 "... chi ama il mito ... è filosofo ... appunto perché μύθος e σοφία sone strettamente legati alla meraviglia'. 3* Aristotle's Metaphysics, a revised text with introd. and comm., vol. I (Oxford 1924) 123. 11</page><page sequence="12">listener or reader to realize his own ignorance. In the context of Meta physics A 2 it is impossible that this should be Aristotle's intention. Then myth would no longer fonction as a world-orientation for the common man, but virtually as a starter-motor for scientifïc research.39 In our view Aristotle's concern is to accentuate the 'receptivity for wonder' shown by the poets of myth. They must be judged superior to the ordinary man, who shows no receptivity whatsoever for all those things and events around him that could arouse wonder. Aristotle places the poets of myth and those who strive for wisdom together on a higher level than the ignorant masses who have no idea of the great problems posed by the world around them and the riddle of human life.40 He does this, for example, in the case of the poet who represented Atlas as supporting the vault of heaven with his gigantic frame, because this man at least showed himself aware of the question why heaven does not fall on top of the earth. The inventor of the myth about Demeter, Hades and Persephone feit the pressing problem of the continuity of life and the successive altemation of life and death. The poets who spoke of the gods enthroned on the peak of Mt. Olympus were sensitive to the différence between the transience of human life and a world of immortal and unchanging beings. And when they recounted the struggle of the gods among each other, culminating in the absolute rule of Zeus as upholder of the cosmic order, they demonstrated that they had reflected on the organization of human society.41 These men were moti vated to create myths because they did not wish to remain on the level of accepting things as they are. They were intrigued by the question 'why' in its earliest form, by the desire to interrelate diverse facts in an encompas sing framework. The fact that these relations were so often not self-evi dent, but could develop into fascinating and indeed terrifying problems, made a profound impression on them. Since this being fascinated by the data of experience can arise in all the various areas of that experience, we may assume that, in Aristotle's opinion, myth was basically able to deploy itself in the same spheres of interest as philosophy. From the above analysis we may conclude that Aristotle is convinced that some people are more susceptible to wonder than others. In order to complement our analysis, however, it should be observed that in his view one part of the world of experience is more likely to give rise to wonder than another, so that one can speak of a natural préoccupation on the part of myth and philosophy with a certain category of problems. From modern 39 The interprétation of Benardete 1978/79 214 appears to move in this direction: 'The poets, who call themselves wise, make marvels, which are called myths. Far ffom such wisdom, then, putting an end to wonder, it issues in wonder. If 'the lover of myth too is in a sense a lover of wisdom' and hence 'myth' stands in for 'wisdom', myth must be the enigmatic solution to the enigmatic.' 40 Cf. Plato's Symp. 204a, where the realization of the deficiency ofone's own knowledge is seen as that which gives the philosophers their special position between the gods on the one hand and the ignorant masses on the other. To recognize one's own ignorance is the décisive step towards the right knowledge. 41 Thus Aristotle would have been able to show appréciation for the originator of the story that the lioness thrusts out her womb in giving birth to her young in as much as this man showed amazement at the fact that the population of lions is comparatively low in number. But the story itself he regards as nonsense; see Hist. Atiim. VI 31 579b2. 12</page><page sequence="13">philosophy we are familiar with Immanuel Kant's effusive déclaration on the two subjects that filled him with inspiration: 'mit immer neuer und zunehmender Bewunderung und Ehrfurcht, je öfter und anhaltender sich das Nachdenken damit beschâftigt: der bestirnte Himmel über mir, und das moralische Gesetz in mir'.42 In Aristotle we find something similar. In his opinion two aspects of experience lead man more naturally to a sense of wonder than others, viz. the psychic realm and the heavenly phenome na. The study of the soul and everything associated with it is described as having a higher degree of excellence and value, because it is research 'concerned with superior and more wonderful things'.43 In a well-known chapter of Part. Anim. a similar distinction is made. The part of the natural realm which is not subject to genesis and destruction possesses a higher value, and therefore knowledge of that realm is more valuable than knowledge of what takes place in the sphere of human existence.44 The study of mortal living beings which Aristotle is about to undertake is concerned with beings who are intérior to the heavenly bodies.45 Al though he emphasizes the relative value of the biology of mortal créatures and retains the view that also in it an element of the thaumaston is manifested,46 at the same time it is quite apparent that the realm of the immortal beings in heaven is thaumaston par excellence. The texts which we have cited leave us in no doubt that Aristotle wished the quest for knowledge to be given as broad a scope as possible, but that nevertheless one part of the observed phenomena exercised a stronger attraction on him than the rest. The explanation for the precedence given to the psychic and celestial realms will surely have to be found in Aristotle's conviction that by making study of these realms progress will be made on the path to discovering the ultimate origin of the whole of reality, the supra-psychic and meta-physical principle of nature and man, namely God.47 These phenomena are truly and properly thaumasia. They fascinate and intri gue, never ceasing to captivate the mind. It would be entirely consistent with the above account to présumé that in Aristotle's view myth above all concerns itself either with the subject of the soul, its residence in Hades, Tartarus and perhaps the Isles of the Biest, or with the heavenly régions and their ceaseless révolutions, the différence between the stars and the planets and between the five planets and the sun and moon, the entire harmonious order of heaven. This view of the Stagirite may well have been reinforced by the fact that there was a tendency in the fourth century B.C. to reinterpret the old mythical tradi tions in terms of new astronomical ideas. A striking example is found in the Politicus myth of Plato. The révolution of the fixed stars is represented 42 Imm. Kant, Kritik der praktischenVernunft (conclusion). Cf. B. Dumoulin 1981105 ff. 43 De anima I 1 402a2 τψ βελτιόνων κα'ι θανμασιοτέρων είναι, 'concemed with superior and more remarkable things', D. W. Hamlyn (Oxford 1968). 44 De Part. Anim.

Moreau 195957-61,196635-38. 47 It is no coïncidence that in another text dépendent on the De Philosophia (ff. 12a Ross) the two paths which lead to knowledge of the highest principle proceed via psychic pheno mena on the hand and astronomical phenomena on the other. On the path via astronomy cf. also ff. 13 Ross. 13</page><page sequence="14">as changing its direction of movement as the resuit of divine intervention after the atrocious crime of Thyestes.48 Our scanty evidence suggests that Xenocrates gave the myth of the Titans a cosmological-astronomical in terprétation.49 Vestiges of a similar transformation of mythical traditions are found in Aristotle's references to the figure of Atlas,50 Ixion,51 and perhaps Kronos.52 The same may be suspected with regard to the names Phaëthon53 and Daedalus and Icarus.54 Myth and philosophy are both equally inspired by that area of ex périence which gives rise to the most thauma. This is the realm where the influence of the divine is at its strongest and clearest. It is hardly surpri sing that Aristotle can use the word 'theologos' for the 'poet of myth' and that in his view philosophy culminâtes in theologia.ss 5. Myth as protreptic, not compelling argument On the basis of our earlier discussion we reached the conclusion that Aristotle placed the mythicizing poets of old together with the philoso phera on a hieher level than the common man who is whollv nreoccuDied *' Plato, Pol. 268e-269a. 49 Xenocrates fr. 19 &amp; 20 Heinze, cf. P. Boyancé 1941 166-171, 1948 219 ff. 50 Cf. De Caelo II 1 284al8-23; in this passage Aristotle shows his awareness of the différence between the old myths and the modem théories which (in some respects) show affinity to them. In De Motu Anim. 3 699a27 ff., on the other hand, it might seem that current théories conceming the axis of the universe and the relative révolution of the heavens are making use of old mythical figures. 51 De Caelo II 1 284a34 is perhaps a playful thought of Aristotle. He suggests that the heavenly région, which Plato at Tim. 40a describes as divine and εϋκνκλος, can according to the Platonic view only possess happiness in the manner of Ixion, the mythical figure who was bound to a revolving wheel. It is possible, however, that in the Old Academy Plato's doctrine of the world-soul was given a négative interprétation precisely because of that soui's attachment to a body. If such an attachment is regarded as punishment for the soul, just as in the case of the human soul's residence in the body (cf. Phd. 62b and Crat. 400c), then one might easily connect up the world-soul, which sets in motion the révolutions of the heavenly région, via the 'wheel of births', with the 'wheel of Ixion'. 52 Conceming Kronos our evidence is confined to the mysterious passage of Tertullian, De Anima 46.10 = Protrepticus fr. 20 Ross. On this see further J. H. Waszink 1947 145-149 and 1950, see also H. Chemiss in Plutarch's Moralia (LCL) vol. XII (London 1957) 188 and O. Gigon cited above in n. 11. Cf. I. Düring, Aristotle's Protrepticus (Göteborg 1961) 168. 53 Noteworthy is that the name of Phaëthon, who according to mythical tradition was given permission to drive his father's chariot but did not possess the strength to keep it under control (cf. De Mundo 6 400a31), was given to one of the planets in a series in which the heavenly bodies were not named after various gods, but were given names according to their light-bearing characteristics. There are valid arguments for placing the date of this momen clature as early as the 4th century B.C. (cf. A. P. Bos 1979142-147). In the Aristotelian Corpus these names are encountered in De Mundo 2 392a24. It is worth mentioning in this context that Phaëthon after his failure shared the fate that feil in the Orphie tradition to the Titans, namely to be hit by lightning and to plunge to the earth wholly bumt out. We may suspect that Phaëthon could have been pictured as personifying the fall of the human soul, in a myth similar to the one in Plato's Phaedrus (cf. Mirab. Ausc. 81 836b3). 54 These figures too are well-suited to a myth of the Phaedrus type. The theme of the heavenly ascent and the fatal fall are no less present th'an in the myth of Phaëthon. Moreover it is combined with the theme of being an exile and alien, and is brought in relation to the figure of Minos, often represented as one of the judges in the underworld. Remarkably enough all these figures are mentioned together in Mirab. Ausc. 81. 55 Cf. Metaph. A 3 983b29, Metaph. Λ 8 1074a36-bl4, Ν 4 1091a33. For the 'philosophical theology' see Ε 1 1026a 19. 14</page><page sequence="15">with the things and people that surround him. But this is not to say that we can draw the further conclusion that Aristotle places myth and philosophy on the same level. There can be absolutely no doubt that in his view the activity of the philosopher attains a higher and more reliable form of knowledge than that presented in myth.56 In the final section of our article we shall have to determine with greater precision what the relation of these to each other is and what the résultant conséquences must be. How did Aristotle picture the différence in value between mythical knowledge and philosophical knowledge? The two most significant fac tors will have been the following: (1) the degree of certainty of that knowledge; (2) the degree of removal from concrete, sense-perceptible reality that is reached in that knowledge. To begin with the first factor, myth can contain sound insights but can as easily transmit utter nonsense. The criterion it uses is 'plausibility', not 'coherent logical argumen tation'.57 In contrast, it is a characteristic of the 'first philosophy' that it presents its conclusions in the most exact and compelling form possible.58 With regard to the second point, Aristotle must have been convinced that the attention of myth necessarily remains fixed on the world of sense-per ceptible reality. Even though the muthologos speaks of divine beings, he will always do so in an anthropomorphic manner.59 In his use of myth the poet will never rise to the level of non-sensible, meta-physical, totally immutable entities.60 The positive value which Aristotle was able to attribute to the myths of the old poets as Homer and Hesiod, but also to the more modern versions of Plato and Heraclides Ponticus is due, we con sider, to their protreptic value. Their usefulness lies in the ability to increase man's receptivity for wonder and to attract the attention of outsi ders, among whom especially young people.61 In this process the gran deur of myth and the impressiveness of its conceptions play an important part.62 We are now in a position to consider whether the view ouüined above may shed new light on our évaluation of the Eudemus or On the Soul, the lost work of Aristotle in which he told the story of the legendary king Midas and the demi-god Silenus, as well as, according to some scholars, a myth about the god Kronos. Commentators have frequently expressed surprise at the large gap which appears to exist between the contents and 56 Cf. C. Natali 1977 415. 57 Metaph. B4 1000a9-20. Cf.Metaph.Λ 8 1074b4:μυθικώς προσήκταιπρόςτήνπειθώ τών πολλών και πρδς τήν είς τους νόμους και τό συμφέρον χρήσιν. See also W. Κ. C. Guthrie, 'Aristotle as an historian of philosophy'/.H.S. 77 (1957) 40. 5» Metaph. A 2 982a25-30. 59 Cf. Metaph. Λ 8 1074b5 άνθρωποειόεϊς and Β 2 997bl0. 60 The highest form of philosophy is concemed with the level of nonsensible entities, Metaph. A 2 982a25: πορρωτάτω γαρ τών αισθήσεων έστιν. 61 Cf. Plutarch,De Audiendis Poetis 114e: 'And soof philosophical discourses it is clear to us that those seemingly not at ail philosophical, or even serious, are found more enjoyable by the very young, who present themselves at such lectures as willing and submissive hearers.' (translation F. C. Babbitt LCL). The différence in level we also find expressed in Metaph. a 3 995a4: rà μυθώόη και παιόαριώδη, cf. ibid. 995a6: olμεν ovv éàv μη μαθηματικώς λέγή τις ουκ αποδέχονται τών λεγόντων ο'ι δ'&amp;ν μη παραδειγματικώς, οι δε μάρτυρα άξιούσιν έπάγεσθαι ποιητήν. 62 Cf. Meteor. II 1 353b2: τραγικώτερον γάρ ούτω και σεμνότερου ύπέλαβον Ισως είναι τό λεγόμενου. 15</page><page sequence="16">atmosphère of this work and, for example, the extant treatise De Anima. Often no better a solution could be found than to surmise that the Eude mus does not present the actual views of AristoÜe, but has its content determined by the fact that it was written for a spécifie occasion, i.e. as a consolatio.63 Those scholars who did not wish to remove an entire work from Aristotle's serious oeuvre in this manner were compelled to conclu de that a drastic change of viewpoint had taken place between the Eude mus, which then had to be a youthful work, and the De Anima which was written much later.64 Our discussion above, however, could furnish sup port for the contention that the most probable explanation for the dif férence between the two works lies in the protreptic-paedogogic motive of the Eudemus. The chief function of the captivating mythical passages was to whet the readers appetite and raise his receptivity for wonder. This would also mean that serious reconsideration must be given once again to the old explanation of the différence between Aristotle's exoteric and esoterie works, namely that they have a different reading public in mind.65 In conclusion there is one more question which we would like to raise. Is it true that in Aristotle's opinion philosophy can unrestrictedly reveal to man knowledge of the final causes? Can it disclose the knowledge that god himself possesses?66 Our tentative reply must be that he considered such a goal unreachable for man as man. For this the human condition has too many restrictions and hindrances.67 The philosopher, as a man, re mains a transient créature, afflicted with the burden of matter, assailed by the irrational, limited by the primary necessities of life, handicapped by the shortness of mortal existence. Aristotle too sees it as the task of his philosophy to hammer home to man the limitations of his human con dition. We possess absolutely no evidence, however, that this realization grew stronger as time went by, and that we have here the explanation for a greater sympathy towards myth in Aristode's old âge, a view put forward by G. Verbeke.68 If there is any form of knowledge able to reveal the 63 See A. H. Chroust 1973 vol. II43-54 who concludes: Ά 'mémorial' such as the Aristote lian Eudemus, like any eulogy of a person near and dear, or, perhaps, a consolatio mortis, is hardly the proper document for reliable inferences as to the author's true and ultimate convictions or teachings', and 'In the face of the tragic death of a close friend, 'the heart has its reasons which reason does notknow', op. cit. 53-4. Againstthis view cf. Β. Dumoulin 1981 31. M H. J. Drossaart Lulofs 1967 18-21 rightly objects against this position when he observes that the dépréciation of the body and the whole material existence in the Eudemus forms the counterpart of an extreme spiritualism, which is no less present in Aristotle's later philoso phy. 65 Cf. the testimonies by Ammonius and Elias in Ross, Fragmenta 6-7 and by Simplicius, ibid. 84. 66 Cf. Metaph. A 2 983a5-ll. 67 Cf. ibid. 982b29 πολλαχή γαρ ή φύσις δούλη των άνθρώπων έστίν ('since in many respects human nature is unfree') and Ε th. Ntc. X 7 1178a26 ff. See also Metaph. a 1 993b9, where the relation of man's nous to 'those things which by nature are best known' is compared with the eyes of a bat in respect to daylight. Frequently Aristotle asserts that man, in the light of his human nature, can only proceed ffom that which is to him epistemically accessible. See Ε th. Nie. 14, 1095b2: άρκτέον μεν γαρ άπό των γνωρίμων, ταύτα δε διττώς'τά μεν γαρ ήμϊν, τά δ' απλώς, ίσως ονν ήμιν γε άρκτέον άπό τών ήμϊν γνωρίμων. " G. Verbeke, art. cit. 1961,410 (η. 7) commenting upon the fragment 668 Rose3 that we mentioned above (n. 13). 16</page><page sequence="17">mystery of the world we live in, it must unquestionably be that knowledge to which philosophy aspires.69 The only possible conclusion is indeed drawn by Aristotle himself: man will obtain such knowledge when he has left behind all the restrictions of the human condition! He will possess the knowledge concerning god and the knowledge possessed by god only when he realizes the possibility contained within him, namely to become god himself. There are no texts which can elucidate for us how Aristotle thought he could solve this mystery of human existence, namely how to explain that a mortal man possesses the possibility to become god. He was well ac quainted with the myths of the Orphies, Plato and the Pythagoreans of his day, who speak about this mystery in poetic terms. He too joined this tradition in the Eudemus. But this work had a fundamentally protreptic character. As our research now stands, we are unable to determine the précisé relation between that work and the discussions in the De anima. The scope of the latter work is limited to the viewpoint of the physikos, which leaves the possibility of its being supplemented by knowledge of a higher, more encompassing order. But we are not in a position to décidé whether the Eudemus claimed to supply precisely that knowledge. At the same time we are able to reach a critical conclusion of our own. The fact that the rational apodeixis of Aristotle the philosopher falls short when it must tackle the mystery of human existence,70 while he never theless speaks in the most eloquent terms of man's divine potential,71 must be taken as indicating the validity of the view presented in the fïrst part of our discussion, namely that the systematizing logical activity of the rational enquirer is guided and controlled by an encompassing framework of presuppositions which are pistic in character. " Cf. G. Verbeke art. cit. 418. In this context the text found in Cicero, Tusc. Disp. 3.28 69 (= Protrepticus 8a Ross) is remarkable: ... Aristoteles ... ait ... se videre quod paucis annis magna accessio facta esset, brevi tempore philosophiam plane absolutam fore. I. Dûring 1961 231, however, notes: 'This passage should never be quoted as evidence for an opinion expressed by Aristotle, only as evidence of what Cicero believed that Aristotle had said.' 70 Cf. Ch. Lefèvre, Sur l'Évolution d'Aristote en Psychologie (Louvain 1972) 286: 'jamais Aristote ne parvient à mettre en formule ni à justifier l'unité complexe de l'individu humain', and J. L. Ackrill, 'Aristotle on Eudaimonia', Proceedings of theBritish Academy 60 (1974) 358: 'Just as he cannot in the De Anima fit his account of separable reason - which is not the form of a body - into his général theory that the soul is the form of the body, so he cannot make intelligible in the Ethics the nature of man as a compound of 'something divine' and much that is not divine.' 71 In this context the article of F. L. Peccorini 1979 is worth mentioning. This author maintains that the doctrine of the divine nature of the soul is based on Orphie mythology 'which was taken seriously by all Greek philosophers' (217). He proceeds to argue that Aristotle, not only in the Eudemus but also in his work the De anima, in spite of obvious différences between these works, stood 'under the spell of Orphie myths' (255).
