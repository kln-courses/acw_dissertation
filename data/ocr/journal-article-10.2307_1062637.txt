Reynolds THE SEVERAL BODIES OF BUDDHA: REFLECTIONS ON A NEGLECTED ASPECT OF THERAVADA TRADITION There is no dearth of scholarship concerning the various concep- tions of the bodies of the Buddha which have developed within the history of Buddhist symbolization and thought. Excellent studies have been carried through by a number of eminent buddhologists, including Louis de LaValle Poussin, Nalinaksha Dutt, D. T. Suzuki, Maryla Falk, Paul Mus, Paul Demieville, and, most recently, Nagao Gadjin.1 However in every case the primary objective of this research has been to interpret the emergence and meaning of the doctrine of the three bodies of the Buddha (the dharmakdya, the samboghakdya, and the nirmdnakdya) in the Mahayana and especially the Yogacara schools.2 As a result the 1 Louis de LaVallee Poussin, "Notes sur les corps du Buddha," Le Museon (1913): 251-90; Nalinaksha Dutt, Aspects of Mahayana Buddhism and Its Relation to Hinayana (London: Luzac, 1930); Maryla Falk, Nama-Rupa and Dharma-Rupa (Calcutta: University of Calcutta, 1943); D.

Since it was in one of Professor Eliade's fascinating and wide-ranging courses on "Myth and Ritual" that I was first alerted to the vast richness of the kdya symbolism in Buddhism, it seemed appropriate to take the occasion of this volume dedicated to him to point out this rather important lacuna in the existing scholarship and to at least begin the task of filling it. In order to do this I will first call attention to the fact that the dhammakdya and rupakdya embody the two basic Buddhological realities on which Theravada religion has historically grounded itself. Second, I will discuss the way in which the mainstream of Theravada interpretation has developed the conception of the body which the Buddha acquired through his supranormal and ultimately soteriological attainments. Finally, I will consider an interesting variant of this latter tradition which seems to have had a long though rather obscure career on the fringes of the Theravada community. DHAMMAKAYA, RUPAKAYA, AND THERAVADA COMMUNITY In considering the structure and development of early Buddhism and the subsequent Theravada tradition, it is difficult to over- emphasize the importance of a very basic distinction which is made in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta. In this text, which was composed within a century or so after the actual decease of the Founder, his activities during the last months of his life are described and his final instructions to the community of bhikkhus are recounted. As the narrative proceeds, it recounts that on a certain day the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ananda and said, "It may be Ananda, that in some of you the thought may arise, 'The word of the Master is ended, we have no teacher any more.' But it is not thus, Ananda, that you should regard it. The truths [dhamma] and the rules of the order [vinaya] which I have set forth and laid down for you all, let them, after I am gone, be the Teacher to you." 3 In addition he gave his followers instructions that his physical remains should be turned over to the wise and the noblemen among the laity who should perform a cremation ceremony in the manner ordinarily reserved for a Cakkavatti 3 Digha NikCya 6.6.1.

The early legends which tell of the events following the Buddha's demise reaffirm this distinction between the two legacies which he left to the two different segments of the Buddhist community. According to a cycle of legends which is closely bound up with Mahaparinibbana Sutta, within a few months of his decease the Buddha's leading disciples called a great council known as the Council of Rajagaha at which the dhamma and the vinaya were recited and their authority affirmed. On the other hand, the Mahaparinibbana Sutta itself reports that immediately following the Buddha's demise his relics were turned over to the noble clan which ruled the village of Kusinagara near which the great decease had occurred and that the cremation was performed in the manner prescribed. It goes on to report that, as a result of the desire of a number of neighboring rulers to possess at least a portion of the relics, they were divided and that a number of separate stupas were then built in various areas in order to house the portions which had been distributed. There is a strong body of evidence which suggests that during the canonical period this division both grounded and reflected the realities of life in the Buddhist community. The study, recitation, and interpretation of the remembered teachings provided a major focal point of identity and life in the early Buddhist order of bhikkhus,4 and particularly after the time of King Asoka (the third century of the Buddhist era, ca. 250 B.c.) the reliquary stupas and the cult which was associated with them came to play an increasingly important role as a prime focal point of Buddhist identity and life among the laity.5 Moreover, in the period between the closing of the canon and the translation of the Sinhalese com- mentaries into Pali (ca. the fifth century A.D.) the two legacies came to be referred to as the Buddha's dhammakdya on the one hand and his rupakaya on the other. In Milinda's Questions, for example, the term dhammakdya is used in a context in which it is clear that it is being identified with the scriptural tradition.6 And 4 See, for example, the classic account in Etienne Lamotte's Histoire du Bouddhisme Indien (Louvain: Publications Universitaires, 1958). 5 The topic is introduced by Sukumar Dutt in his work Buddha and the Five After Centuries (London: Luzac, 1957) and is treated in depth in Akira Hirakawa's article, "The Rise of Mahayana Buddhism and Its Relation to the Worship of Stupas," Memoirs of the Research Department of Toyo Bunko, 22 (1963): 57- 106. 6 As we shall see, the term dhammakdya was already in use in the canon. How- ever in the later context it is clear that the dhammakdya is being identified with 376</page><page sequence="4">History of Religions in the Sumaigalavilasini (1, 34 and 3, 865) the equation of the dhammakdya with the Tipitaka (the three baskets of the fully developed canon, i.e., the Sutta Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka) is quite explicit. As for the rupakdya, the term is introduced and identified with the physical body of the Buddha which manifests the thirty-two major and the eighty minor signs traditionally associated with Mahapurisa (Great Be- ings) who are destined to attain the status either of a Cakkavatti king or a Buddha.7 This terminological development, it should be noted, corresponds with the roughly contemporaneous icono- graphic process through which the process of housing the Buddha's relics in stupas came to be supplemented by the practice of housing them in anthropomorphic images which explicitly port- rayed his physical form as that of a Mahapurisa.8 In the tradition of Buddhist chronicles which developed in Sri Lanka and was continued in Southeast Asia, the emphasis on the Buddha's dual legacy and its maintenance through the course of Buddhist history provided the preeminent theme. The major chronicles such as the Mahavansa (Ceylon, fifth century A.D.) and the Jinakalamali (northern Thailand, sixteenth century A.D.) con- stituted what might be described as extended biographies of the Buddha. They began with accounts of the Buddha's previous lives and his final life as Gotama, and then went on to recount the fate of the two legacies which he left to his followers-the dhamma or dhammakdya legacy, which was manifested in the Pali scriptures, and the relic or rupakdya legacy, which was manifested in the most important stupas and images.9 What is more, certain major patterns of symbolism which can be reconstructed from the chronicles and other archeological, architectural, and icono- graphic data have as their basic theme the copresence of the Buddha's dhamma or dhammakdya represented by the scripture (in this connection it is interesting to note that the Tipitaka was often kept in containers which had an obvious resemblance to a the scriptural legacy. See I. B. Horner, trans., Milinda's Questions, vol. 1, Sacred Books of the Buddhists, vol. 22 (London: Luzac, 1963), pp. 96-100 (= pp. 71-73 in the original), noting especially the comparison between the writing of the elder named Tissa and the teaching or dhammakaya of the Buddha which is made at the very outset of the discussion. 7 See S. Dutt, p. 101. 8 For a discussion of this latter development, see Ananda Coomeraswamy, "The Origin of the Buddha Image," Art Bulletin 9, no. 4 (June 1927): 287-328. 9 This development is discussed in some detail in my article on "The Many Lives of Buddha," in Reynolds and Capps, eds., The Biographical Process: Essays in the History and Psychology of Religion, Religion and Reason, vol. 11 (The Hague: Mouton, 1976). 377</page><page sequence="5">Several Bodies of the Buddha coffin) and his rupakdya represented by a reliquary stupa, a reliquary image, or in some particularly interesting cases by both.10 The central importance which became attached to the canonical scriptures which manifested the dhamma or dhammakaya, to the reliquary stupas and images which manifested the rupakdya, and to the copresence of the two as the basic sine qua non for the establishment and maintenance of Buddhism as a historic religion is a theme which can be traced in a variety of texts and cultic situations in various areas of Southeast Asia and Sri Lanka. However since I have already written a rather extensive article on that topic which will soon be appearing in another context, I would like to turn now to a related but nevertheless distinct form which the symbolism of the bodies of the Buddha has been given in the Theravada world.11 THE SEVERAL BODIES AND "ORTHODOX 'SOTERIOLOGY Within the Pali scriptures there is a second kind of distinction between the bodies of the Buddha which can also be discerned. It involves a differentiation between the purely temporary physical body with which the Buddha was born and the body(ies) which he attained through his religious practices, and it takes two different forms. A number of canonical passages suggest that through his meditational efforts the Buddha generated out of his physical body a manomaya (mind-made) body which was of quite different sort.12 Other canonical passages suggest that in addition to his normal human body he possessed a supranormal body which, in one very famous sutta, is specifically described as a dhammakaya. The most important scriptural passage which deals with the manomaya body is highlighted by Eliade in his classic work, Yoga: Immortality and Freedom.13 In a sutta which is incorporated in the Majjhima Nikaya and is singled out for special attention in Buddhagosha's Path of Purification, the Buddha affirms that he has called into being "out of this body another body of the mind's creation, complete in all its limbs and members, and with transcen- 10 For pictures of the coffin-like containers in which the scriptures were some- times placed, see George Coedes, The Vajrayana National Library of Siam (Bangkok, 1924), pls. 13 and 14. 11 The relevant article, which is entitled "The Holy Emerald Jewel," will appear in Bardwell Smith, ed., Religion and Political Legitimation of Southeast Asia (Chambersburg, Pa.: Wilson Books, in press). 12 Ndmakdya is another name which is sometimes used to designate this same body; see, for example, the ]Iahdniddna Sutta (Digha Nikaya 2). 13 Trans. by Willard Trask, Bollingen Series, vol. 55 (New York: Pantheon, 1958), p. 165. 378</page><page sequence="6">History of Religions dental faculties: It is just like a man who should draw a reed from its sheath-or a snake from its slough-or a sword from its scabbard, recognizing that the reed, the snake or the sword was one thing and the sheath, slough or scabbard was another."14 The Buddha attains this body through concentrative meditation known as jhdna, and having attained it he is able to visit the various heavenly realms where the Brahma deities live. Or to put this latter point in a somewhat different way, this is the body which is associated with the attainment of the cosmological realms in which there are only attenuated material qualities (riipadhdtu) and the even higher, though still this-worldly (sansdric), realms in which there are no material qualities at all (the arupadhdtu).l5 As for the distinction between the Buddha's ordinary physical body and his dhammakdya, the two most famous and interesting scriptural references are those which are contained in the Safiyutta and Digha Nikayas. According to the passage in the Saiyutta Nikaya, which the commentary explicitly interprets as having reference to the dhammakdya, the Buddha spoke to a monk who had harbored an intense desire to see him in person as follows: "Hush, Vakkali! What is there in seeing this vile body of mine? He who seeth the dhamma, Vakkali, he seeth me: he who seeth me, 0 Vakkali, he seeth the dhamma. Verily, seeing the dhamma, Vakkali, one sees me; seeing me, one sees the dhamma."16 In the passage in the Digha Nikaya it is affirmed that the monks can call themselves sons of the Buddha who are born from his mouth, who are born from the dhamma, who are transformed by the dhamma, who are inheritors of the dhamma because of his dhammakdya which correspond to a brahmakdya and his dhamma nature (dham- mabhuto) which corresponds to a brahma nature.17 In the Pali commentaries the recognition of these three different Buddha bodies was maintained. Over against a number of other 14 Quotation from Robert Chalmers, trans., Further Dialogues of the Buddha II, Sacred Books of the Buddhists, vol. 6 (London: Oxford, 1927), p. 10. 15 The manomayakiya and particularly its role as a precursor to the Mahayana conception of the sambhogakdya is discussed by O. Stein in his "Notes on the Tri- kaya-Doctrine," Jha Commemoration Volume: Essays on Oriental Subjects, Poona Oriental Series, no. 39 (Poona: Oriental Book Agency, 1937). However it is inter- esting to note that in other discussions of the conception of the kdyas in the Pali and Theravada tradition its presence is not even recognized-see for example, Dutt's otherwise very helpful treatment in Aspects, pp. 97-102. 16 Samyutta Nikaya 3, 120-translation adapted from that provided by F. L Woodward on p. 103 of the Book of Kindred Sayings, Pali Text Society Translation Series, no. 13 (London: Oxford, 1924). 17 Digha Nikaya 3, 84. In a parallel passage in the Majjima Nikaya (3, 29) the dhamma (dhammakdya) from which the disciples are born is directly contrasted with the physical body. 379</page><page sequence="7">Several Bodies of the Buddha Buddhist schools which developed more docetic views, the Thera- vadins continued to emphasize the reality and the importance of the Buddha's physical body as a body which had been produced by kamma which had been accumulated in previous lives and was subject to the same kind of intrinsic limitations which affected the bodies of other human beings. The canonical references to the Buddha's evocation of a manomayakdya and its direct correlation with jhdnic attainments were reaffirmed, for example in Buddha- gosha's authoritative manual, the Path of Purification.l8 As for the conception of a dhammakdya, it was both reaffirmed and quite explicitly identified with the attainment of the supraworldly path and the realization of nibbdna. For example, in the commentary on the Safiyutta Nikaya passage quoted above this identification between the dhammakdya on the one hand and the eight stages of path attainment (the stream-winner, the once-returner, the non- returner, and the fully perfected saint along with the fruits of each) and nibbdna on the other is quite explicit.19 Or, to cite another case in point, Buddhagosha explicitly itentifies the dhammakdya with the path interpreted as sila (morality), samddhi (concentra- tion), and panni (wisdom), along with vimutti (emancipation equals nibbdna) and vimittiianadassana (the knowledge of emanci- pation).20 But in spite of the efforts at systematization which went on in many areas of Buddhist thought and symbolism during the period in which the classical commentaries were written, no attempt was made to integrate these three different conceptions within a single, more comprehensive interpretation. When we turn to the later Theravada tradition, however, we do find a text in which a more comprehensive overview is presented. The text in question is an important fifteenth-century vernacular compendium entitled Saddharmaratnakaraya which was written by the Venerable Dhammadinnacariya Wimalakitti of the Pala- batgala Forest Hermitage in Sri Lanka.21 In the discussion of the Buddha bodies which appears in this work, the famous Sinhalese 18 Bhikkhu Nanamoli, trans. (Colombo: R. Semage, 1960), pp. 443-45. 19 Saratthappakasimi 2, 314. 20 Cited in Dutt, pp. 101-2. This way of expressing the identity of the dham- makdya with the path and nibbdna is utilized in other Hinayana traditions as well-see the references in Nagao Gadjin, "On the Theory of the Buddha Body," p. 27, n. 4. The identification of these five elements as the five supraworldly kandha is noted by LaVallee Poussin in his L'Abhidharmakosa de Vasubandhu, tome 4, Melanges chinois et bouddhiques, vol. 16 (Bruxelles, 1971), p. 297, n. 2. 21 An English paraphrase of the section on which the following discussion is based has been very kindly provided by the Venerable Dr. Henpitagedara Jnanavassa of the Vidyodaya University of Ceylon in a personal communication dated May 15, 1976. 380</page><page sequence="8">History of Religions scholar utilizes somewhat different terminology than that which is found in the canon and commentaries, and he incorporates a number of new elements; nevertheless the interpretation which he presents is in direct continuity with the conceptions which were present in the classical Theravada sources. The account in the Saddharmaratnakaraya begins by describing the ripakdya of the Buddha as that body which befits the fourfold modes of living (postures such as walking, standing, sitting, and lying) and is perceived by all beings gifted with the physical eye; it goes on to note that the knowledge of it is beneficial to those un- enlightened beings who do not possess the eye of wisdom. Pro- ceeding then to a discussion of the dhammakdya, the account be- comes more complex. On the one hand the text incorporates a Pali eulogy of the dhammakdya which identifies it with the full range of the Buddha's supranormal attainments and glory. However, in the main body of the Sinhalese discussion the Buddha's attain- ments are divided among three separate bodies-a more narrowly specified dhammakdya, a nimittakdya (a body which remains con- ditioned), and a sunyakdya or emptiness body. The dhammakdya in this more limited sense of the term is the body which is perceived by the wisdom eye possessed by those persons who are endowed with the dharmatma which brings happiness and dispels all evil. In the discussion which follows, this body is associated with the attainment of the eight jhdnas (but not with the ninth, which implies the realization of the status of a nonreturner or a fully perfected saint and brings cessation), with the five abhiiias or forms of mental science (but not the sixth which involves the destruction of the dsavas and coincides with the realization of the path at the level of a fully perfected saint), and with the four types of analytical knowledge (catupatisambidhj). Thus the dhammakdya in this more limited sense appears, in this new context, to be the direct successor of the manomayaklya of the canon and the commentaries. The nimittakdya, according to the Saddharmaratnakaraya, is associated with the eight supraworldly stages of the path and the attainment of nibbdna. And thus it is directly continuous with the traditional conception of the dhammakdya, which was formulated in the passage in the Safiyutta Nikaya commentary cited above. However, it should be noted that in this new context two parallel adjustments have taken place. On the one hand, the strictly supraworldly status of this third body has been somewhat com- promised by associating all but the most exalted stages of the path 381</page><page sequence="9">Several Bodies of the Buddha with the divine realms in the Buddhist cosmological schema and by associating it with the divine eye which, in the traditional Theravada perspective, has the capacity to perceive beings within the cosmological hierarchy.22 In a similar way the ultimacy of the nibbdna which is involved in the attainment of the nimttakdya has been somewhat tainted by specifically identifying it with the city of sopddisesa nibbdna-that is to say, the nibbdna in which certain remnants still persist. Finally, this slight downward shift in the status of the third of the three bodies which the Saddharmaratnakaraya placed in relation to one another has necessitated the positing of a fourth body, the so-called sunyakcya or emptiness body. According to description in the text, this sunyakdya is, as we would expect, associated with the anupddisesa nibbdna dhdtu in which absolutely nothing remains. It is a body which has no death or decay, is free from thirst, unimaginable, incomparable, intangible, inconceivable, devoid of all shapes, neither high nor low, neither short nor long, neither triangular nor square, uncountable, unlimited, devoid of color, invisible, immaterial, etc. Thus we have in this late fifteenth-century Sinhalese work a comprehensive conception of the bodies of the Buddha which closely conforms to the traditions of Theravada orthodoxy. Although it differentiates out a fourth body, it is basically faithful to the canonical and commentarial conceptions of the physical body, the mind-made body, and the body which is constituted by the path and nibbdna. And despite the fact that it incorporates some of the Mahayanist tendencies which were involved in later Theravada religion, it is faithful to the fundamental cosmological structure of the orthodox tradition. Thus the physical body corre- lates directly with the kdmadhdtu or realm of desire, the dham- makdya with the more exalted rupadhdtu (the realm with only a remnant of material factors) and arupadhdtu (the realm where there are no material factors), the nimittakdya with the supra- worldly but still conditioned realm of the path and the city of nibbdna, and the sunyakdya with the realization of the absolutely unconditioned anupddisesa nibbdna. It presents, in other words, a fully developed yet nevertheless thoroughly Theravadin conception of the physical and attainment bodies of the Buddha. 22 The tendency to identify beings who have attained the path as deities seems to be a common feature in late Theravada religion as well as in certain Mahayana contents. For a discussion of another late Theravada example see Harry Shorto, "The Devata Sotapan: A Mon Prototype of the Thirty Seven Nats," Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies 31, no. 1 (1967): 127-41. 382</page><page sequence="10">History of Religions THE ATTAINMENT BODY(IES) IN THE YOGA TRADITION In our discussion of the notion of the Buddha bodies in relation to the orthodox tradition of Theravada soteriology we began by noting the presence, in the Pali canon, of two supraphysical, supranormal bodies of the Buddha, one designated by the term manomayakaya and the other designated by the term dhammakaya. In that context we assumed, in accordance with the general import of the canonical perspective and the more explicit testi- mony of the Pali commentaries and manuals, that we were being confronted with two distinct conceptions, one which was narrowly bound to the yogic element of jhdnic realization as such and the other which was more specifically connected with conceptions of the Buddhist path. However there have been several interpreters of early Buddhism who have suggested that, at the outset at least, these two conceptions were for all practical purposes identical. For example, Maryla Falk, in her fascinating monograph on Nama Rupa and Dharma Rupa, has argued that in the precanonical Buddhist tradition the basic orientation was one in which-as in the Upanishadic-yogic perspective with which she closely associates it-the practice of the path was virtually equated with jhdnic attainment.23 In this proto-Buddhist tradition, Falk maintains, the emphasis was placed on the similarity between the jhdnic Path, which the Buddha himself followed in his quest for enlightenment and nibbana, and the path which was normative for his disciples. In addition, she maintains that this path was basically conceived as a reversal of the devolutionary process and that, despite the mild form of the anattd (no-self) doctrine with which it was associated in the Buddhist context, it presumed a relatively high degree of continuity between the ndma-rupa (sahsdric) realm and the absolute (nibbdna). According to Falk's reconstruction of the precanonical tradition, sdla functioned as the necessary preparation for the path; samddhi, which was identified with the practice of the four jhdna and the attainment of the manomayaklya/dhammakdya, was equated with the path itself; and insight, which was conceived as the culmination of the path, was associated with the acquisition of a second supra- normal body which was designated as the amatakdya (ambrosia or immortality body). Similarly she argued that in the precanonical phase of the tradition the various stages of the path which were recognized (notably the stages of the returner, the stream-winner and the fully perfected saint) were identified with preparation for 23 Falk, see esp. pt. 6, p. 297, no. 2. 383</page><page sequence="11">Several Bodies of the Buddha the path, with the actual practice of the path and the acquisition of the manomayakdya/dhammkcya, and with the culmination of the path and the acquisition of the amatakdya. Thus, she contends, it was only in the later canonical phase of the tradition, after the path of the disciples had been distinguished from the Buddha path and after the monks had come to emphasize the exclusivist impli- cations of the anattd doctrine, that a truly supraworldly path could be meaningfully distinguished from jhdnic practice as such. It quite obviously follows that only then could the dhammakdya be meaningfully distinguished from the manomayakaya.24 Many objections can be raised concerning Falk's claim that she has identified a precanonical phase in the development of Buddhist soteriology and related conceptions of the bodies of the Buddha.25 However, in this context I do not propose to emphasize this aspect of the situation, but rather to point to the positive fact that she has identified and documented a very interesting strand of the tradition which, even if it does not have any clear claim to chrono- logical priority over the more orthodox orientation which we have discussed above, has left undeniable traces in the canonical texts. Having done this, I would like to go further by suggesting that this yogic perspective, in addition to being influential in the development of the specifically Mahayana conceptions concerning the bodies of the Buddha (this is the main theme on which Falk focused in her discussion) also reappears in the perspective of a group which existed on the fringes of the Theravada community during the later centuries of the second millenium A.D., primarily in northern Thailand but also in Sri Lanka. The existence of this group, whose members called themselves Yogavacara clansmen, and the fact that it maintained a Buddhist orientation which has much in common with very ancient Brahmanic, Upanishadic, and Indian yogic traditions has already been noted by Louis Finot, F. W. Woodward, and George Coedes, as well as by Eliade himself.26 Actually very little is known about the origins of the 24 It should be noted that Falk herself sees the distinction which developed as one between the manomayakdya and the dhammakdya-as-scripture. In her dis- cussion she does not seriously take into account the distinction which we are identifying as the crucial one in the specifically soteriological context-namely, that which is made between the manomayakdya and the dhammnakdya as supra- worldly path (the latter being coupled with the attainment of nibbana). 25 For a discussion of the validity of the precanonical hypothesis see Edward Conze, Thirty Years of Buddhist Studies (Columbia: University of South Carolina, 1968), pp. 10-12. 26 Finot, "Recherches sur la litterature laotienne," Bulletin de l'cole francaise Extrcnie-Orient 17 (1917): 1-218; Woodward, trans., Manual of a Mystic, Pali Text Society Translation Series, no. 6 (London: H.

Our knowledge of the historical relation- ships between this group and the broader Theravada community is also very meager, though in this connection it is certainly significant that various texts and traditions associated with the group have been preserved in specifically Theravada contexts. The text which especially interests us here is called the Dham- makaya or Dhammakayassa Atthavannana and was found by Coedes in a Theravada anthology in Pali called the Suttajatakani- dananisafisa, copies of which are located in Bangkok and Pnom Penh.27 In addition to a short but significant exordium and an introductory table of contents, this text consists of thirty segments, twenty-six of which identify twenty-six components of the Buddha's dhammakdya as twenty-six of the attainments associated with Buddhahood and four of which identify four elements of the Buddha's clothing (considered as an integral part of his dham- makaya) with four additional attainments of a similar kind. In some cases the specific equations which are made have a clear doctrinal significance (for examples, see below). In some cases the specific equations which are made have a kind of obvious physio- logical appropriateness (e.g., the equations between the eye and various kinds of supranormal eyes, between the ear and the divine ear, and between the navel and the knowledge of codependent origination). In some cases the equations are made on the grounds of an exact or approximate numerical correspondence (e.g., those which are made between the teeth and the knowledge of the thirty-seven wings of enlightenment, between the supramundane and mundane types of knowledge and the lips, and between the ten calls to memory and the fingers). In other cases the equations seem to be based on the even more accidental grounds of a purely verbal congruence, for example, when the feet (pdda) are equated with the four bases of magical power (iddhipada). And in still other cases the equations seem to be made simply to complete the body imagery and the listing of key attainments-for example, when the stomach is identified as the knowledge of the ten powers and the buttocks as the powers of the five faculties. But the key point for our purposes is that in this text the jhtnic attainments and the supraworldly path attainments constitute a single dhamma body. 27 Our discussion is based on the edition of the text which Coedbs has produced from these two manuscripts and published in the Adyar Library Bulletin. 385</page><page sequence="13">Several Bodies of the Buddha There is, of course, no simple identity between the early yogic interpretation of the bodies of the Buddha to which Falk has called our attention and the perspective which is reflected in the Dhammakayassa Atthavannana. Nevertheless they clearly repre- sent two historically different expressions of the same basic view- point and share the same sort of middle ground between the more typically Theravada and Mahayana orientations. In the exordium to the later Yogavacara text, for example, it is clearly stated that its contents should be remembered by the Yogavacara clansmen who, being gifted with keen intelligence, desire to attain the status of an omniscient Buddha.28 In this instance the text has gone significantly beyond the earlier yogic tradition by attributing omniscience to the Buddha and by recognizing it as an attainment to be imitated by those who follow the Buddhist path. But it is also true that the text strongly expresses the traditional Theravada perspective, which emphasizes that Buddhahood is the product of a series of attainments and makes no reference to the kind of ontological concerns and conceptions which are characteristic of Mahayana speculations. Moreover, in the main body of the Dhammakayassa Atthavan- nana the continuity between the this-worldly realms of ndma-rupa (sainsra), the supraworldly path, and the goal is very much in evidence. In fact the conception of a single dhammakdya which not only encompasses the lesser attainments, the path attainments, and the goal, but also integrates them in terms of a very literally organic imagery, carries this emphasis considerably further than it was carried in the yogic tradition of the early period. However once again this Mahayanist thrust is kept very much in check. First of all, the text quite explicitly places the emphasis on the realization of the various components of the body through specific attainments and says nothing which might suggest that the dhammakdya as a whole has the kind of priority which it tends to acquire in the Mahayana Sutras. Second, with the important exception of omniscience, the closely related knowledge of attain- ing the thunderbolt, and the visual fixation on the color blue, the particular attainments which are highlighted by the text are limited to the usual components of Theravada soteriology. And finally, the symbolism which is evident in the structuring of the text gives a preeminent place to the supraworldly path conceived in terms of the stages of sainthood, and it clearly suggests that there is a direct correlation between that typically Theravada 28 Coedes, p. 254. 386</page><page sequence="14">History of Religions conception of the path and the realization of the highest goal(s); thus the change of lineage which involves entry into this supra- worldly path is equated with the nose, the four basic stages of the path and the particular form of jhdnic realization which is associ- ated with them are equated with the forehead, the attainment of omniscience is equated with the skull, and the attainment of nibbdna is equated with the hair.29 As we have already indicated, it is impossible to trace direct historical connections, if in fact any existed, between the kind of yogic tradition which Falk identified in the early Buddhist milieu in India and the Yogavacara tradition which was operative some 2,000 years later in Southeast Asia and perhaps in Sri Lanka as well. However, what can be affirmed is that these two traditions, each of which seems to have existed on the fringes of the Theravada community, advocated remarkably similar alternatives to the more orthodox perspective concerning the various bodies of the Buddha. CONCLUDING COMMENTS The primary objective of the preceding study has been to demonstrate the presence and importance of various conceptions of the bodies of the Buddha in the Theravada tradition, not only in the canonical and commentarial periods, but in the later stages of its development in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia as well. In addition I have suggested that in order to develop an adequate interpretation of these Theravada conceptions it is necessary to make at least two basic distinctions. In the first place, the con- ceptions of the two bodies of the Buddha as Buddha legacies which provide the basis for the life of the historical Buddhist community (i.e., the dhammakdya as scripture and the riupkaya as relic, 29 In this text, as in the texts which are associated with the early yogic tradition, jhdnic attainments are closely correlated with the attainment of the various stages of sainthood. However, it is also clear that in this Yogavacara context, as in the mainstream of the Theravada tradition, the change of lineage which brings entrance into the path is recognized as a necessary prerequisite for the kind of jhdnic practice which leads to the highest goal. This way in which the Theravadins have differentiated between ordinary jhdnic practice and the special form of jhanic practice which is carried on by those who have entered into the path is discussed in considerable detail by Buddhagosha in his Path of Purification, p. 528-29. The reader who wishes to consult the text of the Dhammakayassa Atthavannana concerning the relationship of the supraworldly path and jhTnic attainments should be alerted to the fact that the path understood in terms of the stages of sanctification is discussed under the heading of the fourth jh&amp;na rather than under the heading of the four paths (in fact there is a section which begins with a reference to the four paths, but it deals with quite a different set). 387</page><page sequence="15">Several Bodies of the Buddha reliquary stupa, or reliquary image) must be distinguished from conceptions of the bodies of the Buddha which have a more directly soteriological import. In other words, the kind of differ- entiation which the Theravadins have traditionally made between the Buddha as founder of the religion and the Buddha as the model for the salvation of his followers on the one hand, and between the dhamma as scripture and the dhamma as path and realization on the other, must be taken seriously into account in this context as well.30 In the second place, within the specifically soteriological area an orthodox perspective must be differentiated from a more yogic strand of the tradition. In the more orthodox texts the supranormal bodies of the Buddha manifest attainments which are directly relevant to the disciples whose goal is to become fully perfected saints (thus the emphasis is on the dhammakaya of the Buddha), whereas in the less orthodox and more yogic strands of the tradition the supranormal bodies of the Buddha manifest attainments which are relevant to the disciples whose goal is to achieve a status which cannot be distinguished from Buddhahood itself (thus the emphasis is on the dhammakdya of the Buddha). Also, in the more orthodox texts the plurality of supranormal bodies is maintained in such a way that the differentiation between purely jhdnic attainments and the practice of the nibbdnic path is highlighted, whereas in the less orthodox and more yogic contexts there is a tendency to conflate the supranormal bodies and in so doing to emphasize the continuity between specifically yogic attainments and the attainments of the stream-winner, the once- returner, the nonreturner, and the fully perfected saint. With these two basic distinctions established, it should now be possible to push forward this kind of research in at least two mutually supportive ways. First of all, it should be possible, through the location and examination of additional texts which deal with the subject, to develop a much more nuanced and historical interpretation of the various types of kdya symbolism within the Theravada tradition itself. And what is perhaps even more important and interesting, it should also be possible to reconsider, from the new and very helpful vantage point which this 30 The Mahayanist thrust which results from the failure to make or hold to this distinction between the dhammakaya as scriptural body and the supranormal body(ies) constituted by soteriological attainments is brilliantly explicated by Paul Mus at various points in his preface to Barabudur: Esquisse d'une histoire du bouddhisme fondee sur la critique archeologique des textes (Hanoi: Ecole Francaise Extreme Orient, 1935). 388</page><page sequence="16">History of Religions research can provide, some of the complex historical and structural relationships between the religious perspective(s) of the Thera- vadins on the one hand and of the various Mahayana schools on the other.
