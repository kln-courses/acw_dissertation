NUMBER 1 ? 2007 Tel Tsaf: The 2004-2006 Excavation Seasons* YosEF Garfinkel David Ben-Shlomo Michael Freikman Ariel Vered The Hebrew University of Jerusalem GENERAL BACKGROUND The period generally termed Tottery Neolithic B' (henceforth: PNB) is probably the most obscure chapter in the archaeology of the Southern Levant. Various cultural units have been suggested for this period over the years: Jericho VIII, Wadi Rabah, Wadi Rabah variants, Beth Shean XVIII, Qatifian, and many more (for a detailed list, see Garfinkel 1999: 1-7). The accumulation of new strati graphic sequences, typological analyses and radiometrie dating suggests two main phases within the traditional PNB. These, together with the well-known Ghassul-Beersheba cultural unit, create a continuous cultural development, which can be divided into three main 'archaeological periods' (Garfinkel 1999). * In June-July 2004, a survey (license no. G-51/2004) and a sounding (license no. G 52/2004) were conducted at Tel Tsaf by Yosef Garfinkel, with the help of Yorke Rowan and students from the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The second and third excavation seasons at Tel Tsaf lasted six weeks each (license nos. G-31/2005 and G-53/2006). Three Hebrew University departments were involved ? the field school for students of the Institute of Archaeology, the Rothberg School of Overseas Students, and Science Oriented Youth ? as were various volun teers from Israel and abroad. The expedition was housed at Kibbutz Kfar Ruppin Bird Watch Centre and received technical help from Kibbutz Tirat Tzvi. The project was supported by the Philip and Muriel Berman Center for Biblical Archaeology, the Irene Sala CARE Foundation and the Curtiss T. and Mary G. Brennan Foundation. Staff members include: D. Ben-Shlomo, M. Freikman, A. Vered, A. Shatil, D. Shaham, J. Rosenberg (surveyer) and A. Cohen (conservation). Field photographs were taken by various expedition members: photographs of artefacts are by V. Naikhin. IEJ51 (2007): 1-33 1</page><page sequence="2">2 Y. GARFINKEL, D. BEN-SHLOMO, M. FREIKMAN AND A. VERED The Early Chalcolithic period includes the Wadi Rabah culture, best known from Layer 2a at Munhata (Perrot 1964; 1966; Garfinkel 1992), with smaller excavations at Jericho VIII and PNB (Garfinkel 1999: 148-150), cEin el-Jarba (Kaplan 1969) and Abu Zureiq (Garfinkel and Matskevich 2002). Additional, as yet unpublished, excavations have been conducted over the last 15 years at Nahal Zehora, Tel Esur (Tell al-Asawir), Horvat cUza and ha-Gosherim (Gopher 1993; Yannai 1997; Getzov 1995; 1999). The Middle Chalcolithic period includes Beth Shean Layer XVIII, Tel Tsaf, the 'Wadi Rabah variants' and the Qatifian culture of the northern Negev. The Late Chalcolithic period is the 'classical' Chalcolithic period, which includes various regional developments, such as the Ghassul-Beersheba sites, ossuary burials in the coastal plain, the Nahal Mishmar hoard and the Golan Heights sites. This period has been investigated intensively over the years by numerous scholars (e.g., Mallon et al. 1934; Perrot 1955; Perrot and Ladiray 1980; Bar-Adon 1980; Levy 1986; Gilead 1988; Epstein 1998). The least known part of this new sub-division is the Middle Chalcolithic, the existence or dating of which has been questioned by various reviewers (e.g., Banning 2001; Lovell 2000). In order to clarify this debate, Tel Tsaf was chosen for a large-scale excavation project by the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Three field seasons have already been conducted, and we hope to conduct five additional seasons. THE SITE AND ITS PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS Tel Tsaf (Israel new grid ref. 2015 2024) is located in the central Jordan Valley near Beth Shean and Kibbutz Tirat Tzvi. It is situated on the edge of the Jordan River's west bank, between the upper ('Ghor') and lower ('Zor') terraces (figs. 1-2). Approximately 500 m. to the north, the tributary of Nahal Bezeq joins the Jordan River. This is the typical location of Neolithic and Chalcolithic sites along the Jordan Valley (Garfinkel and Miller 2002:11-12, fig. 2:1). The absolute eleva tion in the region is 270-280 m. below sea level. The site is not a typical tel, but consists of three shallow hills, extending around them to the west and north. In the Middle Chalcolithic period this area reached c. 20 hectares and included the nearby Tel Jemacin. The eastern hill, adja cent to the Jordan River, is medium in size (1.5 hectares) and is currently beyond the border fence. In the 1970s, a massive military installation was constructed on it, probably destroying large parts of the ancient remains. The depth and nature of the archaeological layer here were never examined. The western hill is the largest (3.5 hectares), rectangular in size and isolated from its immediate vicinity. A rela tively wide and shallow gully, west and north of it, is used today for agriculture. A deep, narrow gully in the south separates between the western and southern hills. In the east a small depression separates the western and eastern hills. The current</page><page sequence="3">TEL TSAF: THE 2004-2006 EXCAVATION SEASONS 3 border fence and the border patrol road were constructed along this depression. The southern hill, the smallest of the three (0.1 hectare), is very steep. It was eroded on three sides ? the north, west and south; the southern side was cut sometime in the 1980s, when the current border fence and patrol road were constructed. Most of the accumulation is natural sediment, and only the upper part of each hill is the result of human occupation. In addition, it is quite possible that the gullies were cut after the site's abandonment, possibly by Nahal Bezeq, the course of which, according to observations carried out in the first half of the twentieth century, changes quite often (Nir 1989: 56-57). There is a clear need for geologi cal and geo-morphological studies in order to clarify the depositional history of the site and its vicinity. Tel Tsaf was first reported in the survey of the region conducted by N. Zori in the 1940s and 1950s (Zori 1958; 1962). In the 1970s and early 1980s, the site was damaged by various military activities. In the late 1970s, R. Gophna conducted a small-scale excavation on the western hill. He carried out three short seasons, each lasting one or two weeks. The area excavated was on the eastern side of the western hill, designated Area A by the new expedition. Here eight squares (2x2 m.) were excavated, and virgin soil was reached in two test pits, 3 m. below topsoil (Gophna and Sadeh 1988-89). Rich, well-preserved remains were unearthed: mudbrick architecture, installations, pottery, flint, animal bones, charred wood and pollen (Gophna and Sadeh 1988-89; Gopher 1988-89; Hellwing 1988-89; Liphschitz 1988-89; Horowitz 1988-89). A special group of decorated pottery was found at Tel Tsaf (Gophna and Sadeh 1988-89, figs. 6-8; see below). At the time, the main settlement (his Stratum I) was dated later than Wadi Rabah (Early Chalcolithic) and earlier than the Late Chalcolithic (Gophna and Sadeh 1988-89). Four years later, however, Tel Tsaf was dated as contempo raneous with Wadi Rabah culture (Gopher and Gophna 1993: 326-328). In 2000-2001, A. Kohn-Tavor conducted an intensive archaeological survey of the Beth Shean Valley, including a careful examination of Tel Tsaf and its envi rons. It was found that the site is c. 20 hectares in size, extending beyond the three hills to the west and the north. The results of the previous research clearly indicate that Tel Tsaf is a key site for investigating the Middle Chalcolithic period for several reasons: its size, the thick accumulation of cultural debris, the excellent preservation of brick architec ture, the rich material culture, the distinguished pottery decoration that raises various questions, and its botanic and faunal remains. Thus, a site survey and test excavation were conducted in the summer of 2004, and two large-scale excava tion seasons were conducted in the summers of 2005 and 2006.</page><page sequence="4">Y.

Instead, we laid out 26 squares (5&gt;&lt;5 m.) on the site and in areas to the north and west. Vegetation was then cleared with hand tools, and all visible material culture remains were collected. The following areas were sampled (fig. 1 ; points indicate squares): 1. The western hill of Tel Tsaf (7-10); 2. Tel Jemacin and its vicinity (11-13); 3. The shallow gully west and north of Tel Tsaf (20-26); 4. The hills beyond the gully to the north-west (2-4); 5. The hills beyond the gully to the south-west (5-6, 14-19); 6. The southern hill of Tel Tsaf (1). Hundreds of ceramic sherds and flint artefacts were found, and their distribution yields a more accurate view of the ancient settlement size (table 1). The survey confirms that the ancient settlement was mainly on the western hill. Pottery and flint were also found, extending over a very large area. Off the western hill the deposits seem to be rather shallow, as indicated by several sections cut by roads and natural erosion. It seems quite clear that the area of the three hills designated by previous schol ars as Tel Tsaf is c. 5 hectares. Tel Jemacin was part of the Tel Tsaf periphery in the Middle Chalcolithic period. The valley adjacent to Tel Tsaf in the west and north may have been a later phenomenon, perhaps an ancient bed of Nahal Bezeq, which cut and eroded away parts of the original remains. Based on the above observations, it seems that the core of the site, c. 5 hectares in size, consisted of the three hills near the Jordan River. A large periphery of an additional 20 hectares to the west and north could represent various sporadic and ad hoc uses ? isolated houses, open-area activities, various industries, cemeter ies, animal pens, and the like. The remains of such peripheral activities are generally completely covered or eroded away; information on this aspect of settle ment organisation is thus often lacking. We plan to test a different peripheral area each season, in order to attain a better understanding of the dwelling area and the use of the adjacent land. AREA Area B, excavated in the 2004 and 2005 seasons, is located on top of the southern hill (fig. 1) and includes two excavation units. One is a vertical shaft (depth: 5.15 m.; diameter: 1.2 m.), which functioned as a well, and the other is the living surface from which the well was dug. No archaeological material was found south of Area B.</page><page sequence="6">6 Y. GARFINKEL, D. BEN-SHLOMO, M. FREIKMAN AND A. VERED Table 1.

An additional 1.5 m. was covered by recently eroded sediments that fell from the section. Further below, the shaft was</page><page sequence="7">TEL TSAF: THE 2004-2006 EXCAVATION SEASONS 7 Fig. 4. Area : well's shaft from above (end of 2004 season)</page><page sequence="8">8 Y. GARFINKEL, D. BEN-SHLOMO, M. FREIKMAN AND A. VERED found intact. In 2004, we exposed the shaft from its eastern side to a depth of c. 4 m. (figs. 3-4) and excavated the upper 2 m. of the matrix accumulated within the shaft. All the sediment was sieved. The shaft was filled with a light grey compact matrix with mudbricks, flecked throughout with charcoal, bone fragments, flint, olive pits, seeds and ceramic sherds. The pottery, all handmade, included V-shaped bowls, holemouth jars and jars with short everted rims. One sherd with typical Tel Tsaf decoration (see below, pp. 17-19) was found as well. In 2005, we concluded the excavation of the well. First, the already exposed shaft matrix was completely unearthed. Then the rest of the shaft, c. 1 m. in height, was exposed from its eastern side. Finally, the sediment in the shaft was exca vated. In the lower 50 cm. or so of the shaft, a change in sediment was detected, now being much darker and heavier. It contained a concentration of 20 vessels, deposited one on top of the other (fig. 5). The vessels were complete but cracked, probably as a result of post-depositional processes. The group included three bowls and various small and medium-sized jars, many with a pair of handles on each side. These vessels are most suited to draw water from the well as they can be balanced securely with a rope. From time to time, however, a vessel slipped to the bottom. In the lower part of the shaft there were also several bricks, perhaps part Fig. 5. Area B: vessels in bottom of well</page><page sequence="9">TEL TSAF: THE 2004-2006 EXCAVATION SEASONS 9 of a superstructure that fell from the top of the well, as well as part of a goat carcass. The well may have gone out of use when the goat fell into it, contaminat ing the water. Inside some of the pottery vessels, very fine dark brown clay deposits were found. This sediment sunk into the vessels when they were immersed in the water. After the shaft was completely cleaned we examined the virgin sediment around it. It became clear that the lowest part of the shaft cuts through a different geological layer. While most of the shaft (c. 4.8 m.) was dug into reddish-brown sediment, the last 40 cm. were cut into hard and compact dark clay. Since this clay is not penetrable by water, it created a sealed layer on top of which the under ground water table could be accumulated. In contrast to the Neolithic well of Shacar ha-Golan, (Garfinkel 2004: 87-98; Garfinkel et al. 2006; Garfinkel and Ben-Shlomo, in press), no water was found at the bottom of the well. This, however, is not surprising, because the geological and hydrological conditions in the Beth Shean Valley are different. Here there are local and seasonal water beds; apparently, there was an active waterbed layer during the Chalcolithic period. The interpretation of the shaft as a well is strongly supported by its geological setting and by the concentration of complete vessels at the bottom of the shaft. If this interpretation is correct, the Tel Tsaf well, one of the most ancient ever found in this region, provides an important source of information regarding the early hydrologie technologies of the Near East. Given the comparative data now avail able from Shacar ha-Golan, where a stone-lined well was discovered and excavated (Garfinkel et al. 2006), it is clear that wells were dug in settlements located near large rivers: Shacar ha-Golan is located only a few hundred metres from the Yarmuk River, and Tel Tsaf is at a similar distance away from the Jordan River. As both rivers are the strongest water carriers of the Southern Levant, there was no shortage in water supply at these sites. Thus, the motivation for digging wells must have had more to do with the better quality of well water; consider ations of convenience could have also played a role. The Living Surface around the Well Another major archaeological feature was visible from the section even before excavations began. Near the top of the southern hill, c. 40-60 cm. below topsoil, a clear horizontal debris layer was found, possibly resting on a paved living surface. This extended from the centre of the hill, near the shaft, for ? distance of c. 6 m. to the east. Although the shaft begins c. 1 m. to the west of the debris layer and the two are not physically connected, the pottery from the shaft and from the living surface is identical, suggesting that they are contemporaneous. We hope to corroborate this conclusion by radiometrie dating. If it is confirmed, the topo graphical discontinuity between the shaft and the living surface may be due to military activities and to natural erosion.</page><page sequence="10">10 Y. GARFINKEL, D. BEN-SHLOMO, M. FREIKMAN AND A. VERED In 2004, a single 5&gt;&lt;5 m. square was set up on the southern hill, as close as possible to the shaft (fig. 1:1). A test pit (2x2 m.) was excavated inside, to a depth of nearly 70 cm. Despite the limited excavated area, rich assemblages of pottery, flint and animal bones were unearthed. In 2005, the area above the well was extended, and included most of the archaeological remains on that hill. An area of c. 5x7.5 m. was opened and was excavated to virgin soil. The working conditions here were quite difficult because of the steep 3 m. slope over a distance of 10 m. The living surface, however, was not as tilted as the recent topography, indicating that the current slope is the result of later erosion. The stone level visible in the section prior to the excavation was completely exposed. It turned out to be an amorphous concentration of stones of various sizes, with no clear shape or pattern. As stones are not common in the vicinity of the site, this concentration must have been man-made, perhaps part of a refuse dump. This concentration also included various broken limestone and basalt stone imple ments: vessels, grinding implements and flint cores. Several concentrations of fieldstones, grinding stones, burnt bones and charcoal were observed, probably the remains of hearths. No architectural remains were found. This seems to have been an open area in the outskirts of the ancient settlement. The area above the well was very rich in material culture remains: pottery (decorated and plain), flint, stone vessels, animal bones, a zoomorphic figurine and various artefacts made of obsidian, shell and other imported minerals. Area was notably rich in beads, sometimes unfinished, chunks of raw greenstone minerals, small chips of greenstone minerals and flint drills. This may have been an area in which beads were produced and exchanged. Two out of the four obsid ian items uncovered in 2005 were found in Area B, one on the living area and the other at the bottom of the well. The location of Area B, near a well situated at the edge of the settlement, must have been a preferred location for interaction between people, either the local community or outsiders, for trade, market days, and the like. It is not surprising, therefore, that so many 'exotic' items ? basalt artefacts, beads and obsidian ? were found in Area B. AREAC Area C (figs. 6-10), opened in the 2005 season, is located on the south-eastern corner of the western hill. The aim of our expedition here is a large horizontal exposure of the built area, which is essential for understanding the spatial dynam ics of the site. In accordance with this approach, an area of 300 sq.m. was opened in 2005, followed by an additional 360 sq.m. in 2006. The following stratigraphy was noted: 1. Late Byzantine to Early Islamic activities immediately below the site topsoil.</page><page sequence="11">TEL TSAF: THE 2004-2006 EXCAVATION SEASONS 11 These were only meagre remains, like pits, hearths, a built oven, a few frag mentary mudbrick walls, concentrations of pottery and an Early Islamic coin (Yoav Farhi: personal communication). 2. A sterilised layer of fine yellowish sediment, probably deposited by wind. At the highest point of the tel this layer reaches over 1 m. of accumulation.</page><page sequence="12">12 Y. GARFINKEL, D. BEN-SHLOMO, M. FREIKMAN AND A. VERED Fig. 7. Area C (end of 2005 season) 3. The Middle Chalcolithic remains. According to Gophna's test pits, there are nearly 2 m. of accumulation from this period. So far, at our deepest points, we unearthed nearly 1 m. of accumulated debris. A few stratigraphie phases were noticed within the Middle Chalcolithic period, but further excavations are needed to clarify this aspect. In the northern squares the upper phases were preserved, while to the south and east these were eroded. Thus, in the northern squares, Middle Chalcolithic remains were preserved approximately 1.50 m. higher than in the southern squares. The Middle Chalcolithic remains are characterised by massive, well-built, mudbrick rectilinear elements, which included rooms and courtyards, and rounded elements, interpreted as rooms and silos. While most remains belong to the same occupation phase, several local architectural modifications were identi fied, as well as floors rising within the rooms. The walls are usually 80-140 cm. thick and are built of well-dried loaf-shaped bricks, usually 15-20x35-40 cm. in size. The preservation is good, and some of the walls stand at least 80 cm. high. Nearly 30 architectural units can be defined in the area excavated. Almost all of the walls are interconnected. Nevertheless, it seems that three different archi tectural units were here, abutting each other. The following description treats the area as three main building complexes.</page><page sequence="13">TEL TSAF: THE 2004-2006 EXCAVATION SEASONS 13 Building Complex I (fig. 8) This structure is located in the north-western part of Area C. So far it has been exposed to a length of 21 m. and a width of 16 m., making its size at least 340 sq.m. It consists of a large enclosure, an open courtyard, bordered by walls in the south and east, while the north and west are currently beyond the excavated area. Inside the enclosure various architectural units were identified: one rectan gular room, two rounded structures and five rounded silos. A few phases of use were noticed, but the general plan of the complex did not change. The main room is an impressive rectangular unit (c. 10&gt;&lt;5 m.), partly plastered. In the north-west corner a mudbrick bench was noticed. The location of the room's entrance has not yet been identified. A number of rounded silos were found in the courtyard, some of them on the same axis. Two other rounded struc tures were noted in the courtyard; these appear to differ from the silos, but further excavations are needed in order to verify their exact character. An accumulation of burnt and cracked stones covered large areas of the court yard, and numerous fire installations (roasting pits and ovens) were found scattered between the structures. The roasting pits are oval in shape (c. 1.0x0.7 m.) and were dug approximately 0.5 m. into the ground. They are filled Fig. 8. Area C: building complex I (end of 2006 season)</page><page sequence="14">14 Y. GARFINKEL, D. BEN-SHLOMO, M. FREIKMAN AND A. VERED with burnt stones and ash (see, e.g., fig. 10). Large quantities of animal bones were discovered around them, mostly pig mandibles. More of these installations were reported by Gophna (Gophna and Sadeh 1988-89: 9, fig. 3, square D5). This type of cooking installation has been discussed by Kaplan (1953). The ovens are built installations, lined with well-fired mudbricks set vertically into the ground. In one case, the bricks were laid in three courses. It seems that large-scale cooking was conducted in this area: the meat was earth-cooked in the ovens and the refuse bones were scattered around. The mandibles and other parts poor in meat may have been removed before cooking and discarded around the ovens, while the meat was consumed elsewhere. Similar (although not identical) fire pits, or kilns, were found in northern Syria at Tell Sabi Abyad, level 4 (Verhoeven and Kranendonk 1996: 81-82). Building Complex II (fig. 9) This structure is located in the north-eastern part of Area C. So far, it has been exposed to a length of 16 m. and a width of 14 m., making its size at least 225 sq.m. It consists of a large enclosure, an open courtyard, bordered by walls in the south, west and north, while the east is currently beyond the excavated area. The eastern side of Area C is badly damaged by slope erosion, and it is not clear Fig. 9. Area C: building complex II (end of 2006 season)</page><page sequence="15">TEL TSAF: THE 2004-2006 EXCAVATION SEASONS 15 Fig. 10. Area C: oven installation C96 whether any remains survived. Inside the enclosure, various architectural units were identified: two rounded rooms used for dwellings and three rounded silos. Various installations were found in the courtyard, including rounded clay basins, pits and a baby burial in ajar. This enclosure is separated from building complex I by an elongated wall which runs from north to south. Rounded structures within courtyards or complexes of rectilinear architecture are considered to be characteristic of Halafian culture in Mesopotamia and north ern Syria. Similar rounded structures were discovered, for example, at the 'burnt village' of Tell Sabi Abyad, Level 6; their size there ranges between 1.5-4 m. in diameter (Verhoeven and Kranendonk 1996: 59-63, figs. 2.9,2.12,2.14-15; for a functional reconstruction of some of these structures, see Verhoeven 1999: 215-220). Halafian rounded structures, sometimes named tholoi, were found at Arpachiya, Tepe Gawra Stratum XVII, Yarim Tepe II, Tell Halaf and other Mesopotamian sites (Aurenche 1981: 36, period 7, pis. 124, 127, 141; Merpert and Munchaev 1984: pis. 1-2). This peculiar phenomenon is not known in the Southern Levant, or from other periods in Mesopotamia. Thus, although the Hala fian is earlier than the Middle Chalcolithic, this architectural resemblance may not be incidental; it may reflect Syrian/Mesopotamian influence, or even immigration of people of the Southern Levant.</page><page sequence="16">16 Y. GARFINKEL, D. BEN-SHLOMO, M. FREIKMAN AND A. VERED Building Complex III (fig. 7) This unit is located in the southern part of the Area C, and was examined only during the 2005 season. The size of the area uncovered so far is 13^15 m., or c. 200 sq.m. It is bordered by walls in the north and east, while the south has been eroded away, and the west has not yet been excavated, there is a large open court yard in the west, with one rounded silo (diameter: 2 m.). East-north of this courtyard there is an elongated room (1.7x5.2 m.). Thick white plaster covered its walls, and the floor was paved with small river pebbles. Further south-east, a few narrow cells were found, bordered by rather thick walls. This arrangement resembles a typical gate of the Bronze and Iron Ages. The construction does not seem to be suitable for dwellings, and is more likely to have served as a storage facility. We hope to uncover more of this unit in the next excavation season by expanding the excavation to the west. The Silos A most prominent and somewhat unexpected architectural element at Tel Tsaf is the round structures paved with mudbricks (flg. 7). So far, at least ten have been uncovered (1.8-3 m. in diameter). They were constructed with bricks alone, creat ing a circular wall; the outer row consisted of loaf-shaped bricks laid as headers, thus ensuring a perfectly circular wall. The inner row was made of more rounded bricks. Basic aspects of these structures still remain to be examined, such as the nature of the floors, the entrances and the roofs. Our interpretation of these closely-spaced series of similar structures as silos is based on ethnographic and archaeological parallels (see, e.g., Aurenche 1981: 257). The appearance of such large silos within residential units in this period testifies to the existence of surplus crops and suggests high social complexity. Parallels to the silos of Tel Tsaf, in both form and construction method, were found at Tepe Farukhabad (Wright 1981), although the latter are dated to about a millennium later. In the Southern Levant, circular structures made of bricks and located inside courtyards come from Late Chalcolithic Tuleilat Ghassul, although these are smaller (1-1.5 m. in diameter) and not as well built (Mallon et al. 1934: 40-41, fig. 12; Koeppel 1940: pis. 12:2, 13:1, 15:1). In Gilat, underground silos lined with bricks were found (Alon and Levy 1990: 23, fig. 6). Little has been written about the nature of these structures. Although Area C at Tel Tsaf was excavated for only two full seasons, the results clearly indicate the existence of a large, well-planned settlement with urban characteristics. The massive architecture consists of large, well-built insular complexes, including open areas with rounded structures, probably used as silos.</page><page sequence="17">TEL TSAF: THE 2004-2006 EXCAVATION SEASONS 17 THE MATERIAL CULTURE Rich assemblages of various types were uncovered in large quantities in Areas andC. Pottery Approximately 80% of the finds were pottery, while flint and other categories constitute the remaining 20%. This is in complete opposition to Late Neolithic sites, such as Shacar ha-Golan, where flint is the major category of finds, reaching approximately 80%. Common open pottery forms include shallow bowls, V-shaped bowls and a small number of chalices. The closed forms consist primarily of rather simple jars with handles, both small and large. The assemblage of complete vessels from the bottom of the well, after restoration, will be an important contribution to the study of the pottery of the Middle Chalcolithic period, as it will provide complete profiles, generally absent from this period. Quite a few holemouth jars were found, bearing applied rope decoration near the rim, characteristic of Middle Chalcolithic pottery (Garfinkel 1999: fig. 105). This type of decoration is absent in classical Wadi Rabah sites, like Munhata 2a, el-Jarba and Nahal Beset I (Garfinkel 1992; Kaplan 1969; Gopher et al. 1992), but very common at Middle Chalcolithic sites like Beth Shean XVIII, Tell esh-Shunah, Tell Abu Habil, Tell es-Saidiyeh at-Tahta and Tel cAli lb (Fitzgerald 1935; de Contenson 1960; Garfinkel 1999). Many of the numerous handles uncovered are flattened loop handles with widened attachments. These are absent or extremely rare in classical Wadi Rabah sites, like Munhata 2a, cEin el-Jarba and Nahal Beset I (Garfinkel 1992; Kaplan 1969; Gopher et al. 1992), but are abundant at Middle Chalcolithic sites, such as Beth Shean XVIII, Tell esh-Shunah, Tell Abu Habil, Tell es-Saidiyeh at-Tahta and TelcAli lb (Fitzgerald 1935; de Contenson 1960; Garfinkel 1999). The same is true regarding the central-raised bases that are quite common in the assemblage (Garfinkel 1999: 184). The term 'Tel Tsaf decoration' or 'Tsafian' (e.g., figs. 11-12) was coined after a group of painted pottery first reported from Tel Tsaf (Garfinkel 1999: 186-188; Lovell 2001: 7). Appearing on relatively elaborate vessels, it usually includes the following characteristics: 1. The upper part of the vessel is covered with a smooth white-slipped surface; 2. The lower part of the vessel is covered with a smooth red-slipped surface; 3. A red line usually appears on the rim; 4. Geometric patterns were painted in black on the white area with a fine brush. The combination of red and black creates the earliest example of bichrome pottery in the Southern Levant;</page><page sequence="18">18 Y. GARFINKEL, D. BEN-SHLOMO, M. FREIKMAN AND A.

The geometric design is placed horizontally, within a frame of parallel lines; 6. The most common motif is a row of net-covered diamonds. Other motifs are quite rare, including net-covered horizontal bands, herringbone design and simple parallel lines. 7. A unique specimen is a sherd on which flying birds are painted in black between the diamonds (fig. 12); 8. Two parallel rows, each with a different motif, were drawn on elaborate items (fig. Hb). This geometric decoration was executed in two steps. First, white wash was applied to the upper part of the vessel, while the lower part was covered with red wash. Second, the patterns were painted in continuous horizontal bands on the upper part. The painting was executed with a fine brush, in some cases 0.5 mm. thick. There is variability in the composition of the decoration and in the level of production: some specimens are extremely delicate and very well executed, while other are of lower quality. Many of the more elaborate examples come from frag ments of jar necks.</page><page sequence="20">20 Y. GARFINKEL, D. BEN-SHLOMO, M. FREIKMAN AND A. VERED Parallels are known from only three sites, all on the eastern bank of the Jordan River: Katar?t es-Samra (Leonard 1989), Tell esh-Shuneh (Gustavson-Gaube 1986: fig. 21:107-109) and Tell Abu Habil (Leonard 1992: pi. 22:2-3, 5). Thus, Tel Tsaf decoration should be examined on a regional scale, and samples from all these sites should be examined by petrography. This would allow a reconstruction of these vessels' mode of production ? whether production was centralised, and if so, where. Similar painted geometric motifs have been reported from the Late Chalcolithic period at Teleilat Ghassul in the lower Jordan Valley (Mallon et al. 1934: pis. 42:17, 50:97, 54:1, 65:1-4,6-8). These, however, were not bichrome and not always on a white slipped background. Moreover, these items (or some of them) may not be Late Chalcolithic. For one thing, Teleilat Ghassul was occupied during the Middle Chalcolithic period as well, and small pottery sherds naturally penetrate from one layer to another in a multi-layer site. For another thing, the report does not specify the exact context of each item. The previous excavators have suggested that Tel Tsaf decoration may be related to the Halafian culture of northern Syria: 'the painted pottery of Tel Tsaf is clearly in the Syrian tradition of Halafian imitations, although presenting an even more limited repertoire of motifs' (Gophna and Sadeh 1988-89: 31). This, however, poses a serious chronological problem, as the Southern Levantine paral lel to the Halafian culture is the Wadi Rabah of the Early Chalcolithic period, whereas, as discussed above, Tel Tsaf is related to the later, Middle Chalcolithic. In this context, a few painted, buff-coloured body sherds with black painted deco ration, found in the 2005 and 2006 seasons, are of special interest (fig. 13). This type of pottery is not known in the Southern Levant, but is characteristic of the Fig. 13. Imported cUbaid sherd</page><page sequence="21">TEL TSAF: THE 2004-2006 EXCAVATION SEASONS 21 Late cUbaid period of North Syria and Mesopotamia. This observation was supported by Joan Oates and Henry Wright, who examined a colour photo graph of one of the items, which also has a close parallel at Ras Shamra, in layer Illb (fig. 14). The cUbaid pottery Fig. 14. cUbaid pottery vessel from Ras from Tel Tsaf bears various important Shamra (de Contenson 1992: fig. 222:4) implications. Chronologically, it indi cates a post-Halafian date, and economically, it suggests long-distance exchange networks in the Levant in the first half of the fifth millennium BCE. We hope to conduct archaeometric analysis to verify these observations, as well as to get a better idea about the origin of these sherds. Flint As mentioned above, the general amount of flint is low in comparison with Neolithic sites. Nevertheless, flint cores and debitage were found in most contexts. The flint tools include sickle-blades, bifacial polished tools, numerous burins and fan scrapers on tabular flint (fig. 15). In Area B, quite a number of flint drills were found, probably used in the local production of beads. Stone Tools Limestone and basalt artefacts were found in relatively small quantities, and are usually small in size. Most of the items are broken, suggesting that they were used until they were completely worn out. Many of the basalt fragments were found in ovens or as part of the pavement around them. Of special interest are two frag ments of fenestrated basalt chalices with openings at the base. Similar fenestrated basalt bases have been reported from Tell Abu Habil, together with pottery painted with Tel Tsaf decoration (Leonard 1992: pi. 22:20-21). This category of objects resembles the elaborate items known from the Late Chalcolithic in sites such as Abu Matar, Gilat and Givcat ha-Oranim (Perrot 1955: pi. 18:b; Alon and Levy 1990: 32-34, fig. 12:3; Scheftelowitz and Oren 2004: fig. 4.4-4.7). These objects might be the forerunners of the highly specialised production of basalt bowls, which later became a hallmark of the classic Ghassulian-Beersheba Late Chalcolithic period. Bone Tools These were found in small quantities. Seashells Imported shells are quite common at Tel Tsaf, but no identification has taken place yet. A few ornaments made of shell were found as well (fig. 16).</page><page sequence="22">22 Y. GARFINKEL, D. BEN-SHLOMO, M. FREIKMAN AND A. VERED ^^^^ Q 1 2? imi^^ cm Fig. 15.

Selected beads made from various coloured stones Obsidian Four small obsidian items were found, two in Area (inside and near the well) and two in Area C, indicating that obsidian trade still continues in this period. In the previous period, in the Wadi Rabah culture, much obsidian was found, includ ing 8,000 items collected from the surface at ha-Gosherim (A. Assaf: personal communication) and the 32 kg. core from Kabri (Stekelis 1958). In the Late Chalcolithic period at Ghassul and Beer Sheba, obsidian was not reported. The relatively small quantity at Tel Tsaf is the latest evidence for trade in this exotic raw material. Beads Approximately 900 beads were found in the excavation. They were made of a variety of raw materials: bone, shell, and limestone, as well as green, black, red and blue minerals (fig. 17), and they display variety in size and form. Of special note is a large concentration of small, disk-like, white beads, possibly made of ostrich eggshell (fig. 18). This concentration, consisting of no fewer than 800 items, was found in the courtyard of building complex I, just east of room C70. Zoomorphic Figurines A few clay animal figurines were found in Areas and C, with a few nearly complete items (fig. 19). A similar item was found in the previous excavation as</page><page sequence="24">24 Y. GARFINKEL, D. BEN-SHLOMO, M. FREIKMAN AND A. VERED Fig. 19.

A nearly complete figurine depict ing a dog is exceptional. Anthropomorphic Figurines Two clay violin-shaped figurines (fig. 20) were found together in the debris accu mulated between silos C74 and C171. While Late Chalcolithic violin figurines were usually made of stone (Alon and Levy 1990: 27-28, tables 3-4, 32-34, fig. 7), the Tel Tsaf items are made of clay and are rather thick and free-standing. The upper part was probably just a delicate neck, but is broken on both items. Breasts appeared on both figurines ? clearly recognisable, albeit small. The location of these figurines between the silos may suggest that some fertility agricultural cult was practiced in this location, maybe in relation to the protection of the crops stored in the silos. Fig. 20. Clay anthropomorphic 'violin-shaped' figurines Sealings (Bullae) and Tokens A sealing with irregular crossed lines on baked clay was found in the early excava tions (Gophna and Sadeh 1988-89: fig. 12:16).

Its elongated and narrow surface bear a geometric pattern of a central strighi line crossed by several shorter ones. It has a small perforated handle. Botanical and Faunal Remains Excellent preservation of animal bones and charred botanical remains were reported by the previous expedition (Hellwing 1988-89; Liphschitz 1988 89). Our investigations confirmed a Fig. 22. Stone seal such items were found (fig. 21), suggesting administrative activities in the site. The concentration of sealings found in room C230 is noteworthy. Clay bullae were previously found in Pre-Pottery Neolithic Munhata (Garfinkel 1995: fig. 20:7-9) and in our excavations at the Pottery Neolithic site of Shacar ha-Golan (Freikman 2006). These, however, were always isolated items, never found in significant numbers. The finds from Tel Tsaf completely change the situation, and we hope to dedicate a special study to this phenomenon in the near future. Other ceramic objects, usually of an elongated form, are interpreted as tokens. As documented by Schmandt-Besserat (1992) they represent early symbolic exchange markers and possible precursors to writing. These are very rare in the Southern Levant.</page><page sequence="27">TEL TSAF: THE 2004-2006 EXCAVATION SEASONS 27 rich assemblage of botanical and animal remains, including charred seeds, olive pits, wood and animal bones. In order to have a systematic assemblage of botani cal remains, approximately 300 litres of sediment were collected and processed through a flotation system during the 2005 season. This is the installation used and described in our previous excavations at Shacar ha-Golan (Allen 2002). The material will be essential to understanding the local environmental adaptations of the inhabitants of Tel Tsaf. The animal bones from the ovens and their proximity to Area C are of special interest; their analysis may illuminate special 'feasting' practices related to the Middle Chalcolithic community. Radiocarbon Samples The previous expedition published one radiometrie dating: RT 508 6720?460 uncalibrated BR It was accepted as accurate by Gopher and Gophna (1993), but rejected by one of us in previous analysis (Garflnkel 1999: 309-310). Three samples, originating from the well's shaft in area B, were submitted by us for radiometrie dating at the end of the 2004 season, and yielded the following dates: Tel Tsaf, charcoal, RT 5045, 6040?65 (813C = -23.1); Tel Tsaf, olive pit, RTT 5044, 5845?35 (813C = -24.5); Tel Tsaf, olive pit, RTT 5046, 5840?55 (813C = -12.8). After calibration, two of the dates fall between 4790 BCE and 4610 BCE, with a probability of at least 68.2%. The third date is somewhat older, and falls between 5020 BCE and 4840 BCE with the same probability. Tel! Tsaf(old)RT508_? 2Q?460HP Tel!

BEN-SHLOMO, M. FREIKMAN AND A. VERED These dates are almost a millennium later than the previous one, but are still earlier than the dating of the Late Chalcolithic period, which is usually dated to 6500-5600/5500 BP (4500-3600/3500 BCE calibrated). Two dates from Tel Tsaf are in the same range as four radiometrie dates from Tel Layer lb, which is also dated to the Middle Chalcolithic (Garfinkel 1999: 310): Tel lb, charcoal, OxA 7800, 5950?45 BP; Tel lb, charcoal, OxA 7804, 5930?45 BP; Tel cAli lb, charcoal, OxA 7801, 5815?45 BP; Tel lb, charcoal, OxA 7802, 5770?45 BP. Fig. 23, which presents the various dates of the two sites together, strongly supports the new date of Tel Tsaf. DISCUSSION After three seasons of excavations, the obscure period of the Middle Chalcolithic may now be seen in a different light. A few major aspects may be emphasised: 1. An Independent Period between the Early and Late Chalcolithic The pottery assemblage from Tel Tsaf is clearly different from the Wadi Rabah pottery, on the one hand, and from the Ghassul-Beersheba pottery, on the other. Various observations, which were based on the analysis of small-scale excavations (Garfinkel 1999) can now be tested on a well-stratified, controlled assemblage. 2. Material Culture The rich assemblages of pottery, flint and stone tools bear various typological characteristics of the Late Chalcolithic period, but nevertheless are distinct. A full picture will be achieved only after the completion of several additional excavation seasons and the final analysis of the assemblages, which will probably take at least a decade. Similarities include V-shaped bowls with two pairs of handles, fan scrapers and fenestrated basalt chalices. Differences include the unique curvilinear architectural elements and the total absence of cornets and churns from the pottery assemblage. The violin-shaped figurines also differ from Late Chalcolithic ones, and should probably be seen as a 'proto-violin' figurine type. Our general impression is that the Late Chalcolithic material culture represents a local development of the Middle Chalcolithic. 3. Chronology As mentioned above, the site of Tel Tsaf was previously assumed to be approxi mately one millennium earlier than the date now suggested. In a few years, a good number of reliable radiometrie dates, from both the settlement area and its vicinity will clarify this issue and help to determine the absolute date of the Middle Chalcolithic horizon with better accuracy.</page><page sequence="29">TEL TSAF: THE 2004-2006 EXCAVATION SEASONS 29 4. Social Organization Such a massive architecture and impressive storage capacity as found in Tel Tsaf were not previously known in the Southern Levant. These phenomena clearly indicate a high level of production and the accumulation of agricultural surpluses. Increased storage capacity provides direct evidence for the accumulation of wealth. On the other hand, the sealings uncovered indicate administrative control and probably redistribution of goods. This is the type of data needed for an under standing of the transition from generally egalitarian societies of the Neolithic period to the hierarchical urban societies of the Early Bronze Age. 5. Long-Distance Exchange Networks Unusual amounts of imported items were found at Tel Tsaf, including basalt and sandstone tools, sea shells, coloured minerals for on-site bead manufacture, cUbaid pottery and obsidian. All this points to the inhabitants' easy accessibility to raw materials from south, west and north. Connections with the northern cultures of Syria and Mesopotamia are possibly reflected in the architectural elements, the decoration style and the imported pottery. Migration should not be excluded. 6. The Middle Chalcolithic as the Background to the Late Chalcolithic Various hypotheses have been raised over the years regarding the origin of the Late Chalcolithic (Ghassulian culture). Now, for the first time, a highly organised pre-Ghassulian settlement has been identified in the Southern Levant ? not merely a few pottery sherds in a test pit, as has been the case until now (for a survey of sites, see Garfinkel 1999), but a large horizontal exposure of an area of nearly 700 sq.m. Such massive brick construction and such a concentration of silos have never been found in any Late Chalcolithic site. The entire perspective on the Late Chalcolithic should now change, and we should realize that it was not necessarily much more developed or more complex in organisation than the preceding period. From these new perspectives, further research should focus on the following aspects: 1. Enlarging the horizontal exposure in Area C in order to clarify the plan of this unique massive architecture, and to determine whether it is one large adminis trative centre or several small nuclear family dwellings abutting one another; 2. Further examination of the rounded silos to determine why such an impressive storage capacity was needed and what kind of social organisation it reflects; 3. The opening of new excavation areas on the hills west of Tel Tsaf in an effort to determine what was carried out in the periphery of the settlement; 4. Geological, geomorphological and aerial photography studies of Tel Tsaf and its surroundings, in order to clarify depositional and post-depositional processes and modern military activities that shaped the site;</page><page sequence="30">30 Y.

Technological and typological analyses of the main material culture catego ries ? pottery, flint and groundstone artefacts ? that will clarify their position in relation to the Early and Late Chalcolithic periods; 6. Further analysis of the long-distance exchange network. This will include mineralogical analysis of the beads made of exotic stones, and p?trographie study of the cUbaid pottery, examining the obsidian source as well the origin of the sea shells. 7. Submitting reliable organic samples for radiometrie dating, in order to place the absolute chronology of the Middle Chalcolithic period; 8. Unearthing additional anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines, as well as burials, for a better understanding of symbolic behavior and religious practices. Whether these targets will be achieved partly or completely, the Tel Tsaf excava tions have already opened up a window to a period and culture that were hitherto basically unknown. The massive construction, the storage capacity, the appear ance of quite a number of clay sealings, the elaborate decorated pottery, the fenestrated basalt chalices and the beads all indicate a highly sophisticated community, with a hierarchical social organisation. However, the Tel Tsaf excava tion project is still in its initial stages, and further field seasons are necessary in order to deepen our understanding of the Middle Chalcolithic period of the South ern Levant.
