<plain_text><page sequence="1">MODERNISM AND THE AESTHETICS OF CRISIS Alan Wilde Like the Dead Father, that gigantic figure who overwhelms the landscape of Barthelme's most recent novel and who serves, among other things, as an emblem of the modernist past, the movement appears at the moment to be "dead, but still with us, still with us, but dead" or, alternately, "dead only in a sense."1 Alive enough, at any rate, to remain a provocation to different factions of the postmodern camp, an incitement to sometimes irascible, sometimes querulous literary and academic violence. The antimodernist attacks are various of course, as various as the many current systems and ideologies that give rise to them, but in sorting through these ample and heterogen- eous indictments, it seems possible to identify, without excessive arbitrariness, two predominant sorts. One centers on the "religio- aesthetic withdrawal [of symbolist modernism] from existential time into the eternal simultaneity of essential art."2 For those who hold this widespread view, modernism presents itself as a congeries of so many closed, spatial, formally organized works: a series of self-sustain- ing or organic constructs distantly proclaiming their inherent su- periority to the messiness of life.

So, in her recent novel, Speedboat, Renata Adler has her narrator reflect, in what is, deliberately, the most unheroic of contexts, on the burden of the modernist past. The section runs, in its entirety, as follows: " 'Take off everything but your slip,' the nurse said. 'Doctor will be with you in a moment.' Nobody under forty-five, in twenty years, had worn a slip, but nurses invariably gave this instruction. There they all are, however, the great dead men with their injunctions. Make it new. Only connect."3 What the two interpretations have in common is, most obviously, the sense of modernism as something monumental, not to say marmoreal: a gallery of timeless heterocosms or imperious speaking heads. Is this what modernism was: a heap of icy aesthetic shapes or a ragbag of detachable moral injunctions? No doubt, there is some evidence for both of these positions, but to assent unequivocally to either is to miss the spirit-the interrogative accent behind the imperative mood-of at least one of the injunctions Adler quotes. Forster's "only connect" expresses desire, not achievement; and it is in the space between the two that modernism, less complacent and smug in its withdrawal than Spanos suggests, reveals the dynamics of its often desperate undertaking. I'll return later in this essay to the question of postmodern attitudes and judgments, but before coming directly to modernism itself, it will be helpful to make a short detour in the direction of modernist criticism, past and present. If I seem thereby to be in danger of constructing a Chinese box of sorts, I can only say that modernism seems at this point to require a somewhat archaeological approach, an uncovering of sedimented layers of criticism that obscure our view of the thing itself. In fact, it may be to the point to take a further step and suggest that modernist literature is by now virtually inextricable from the shape modernist criticism has im- pressed upon it. If so, then the next problem lies in the definition of that shape and in the additional recognition that, despite the emergence of so many competing schools and methodologies, the line of modernist criticism remains strong and unbroken. As an illustra- tion of that fact and as a way of getting at the presuppositions in 3Speedboat (New York: Random House, 1976), pp. 72-73. 14 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="3">question, I want to refer to a recent essay by a young critic: F.C. McGrath's "The Plan of The Waste Land." McGrath's aim is to identify "beneath the superficial fragmentation [of the poem] a specific structural plan that is both consistent and coherent and that provides a means of resolving numerous ambiguities in the poem that have plagued its interpreters for over fifty years."4 The words I have italicized are staples of the New Critical vocabulary, with its emphasis on the unification of the apparently disparate; and in their service McGrath demonstrates skillfully and lucidly that "there is no rebirth in The Waste Land.. . and no restoration. The absence of rejuvena- tion in the modern waste land is the major statement of the poem" (pp. 23-24). In short, the rain does not fall. But almost forty years ago, Cleanth Brooks, using an approach to which McGrath and more than one generation of critics are heir, argued that the rains do fall. Eliot's "application of the principle of complexity" works to "give the effect of chaotic experience ordered into a new whole. "5 Both critics are right, of course-or, at any rate, there is evidence to support both contentions: the "dry sterile thunder without rain" of 1. 342 is followed at 11. 394-95 by "a damp gust / Bringing rain," which gives way in turn, in the next two lines, to the statement that "Ganga was sunken, and the limp leaves / Waited for rain."6 How, then, to resolve the contradiction? The answer, which may seem at first glance no more than an evasion of the problem, is that resolution is neither possible nor desirable-and, quite possibly, not intended. One can agree that the poem's vision of disorder, articulated through techniques expressive of fragmentation and discontinuity, is yet, in its totality, a highly ordered structure. Moreover, one can argue-reading the final stanza not as a conclu- sion but as a telescoping resum6 of the poem as a whole-that The Waste Land ends with a sense of formal closure. But closure is not resolution, and no amount of exegetical juggling will eliminate the antinomy of despair and fulfillment (personal fulfillment at least) for which the rains, not falling or falling, stand as correlative symbols. Briefly, then, I want to argue that the structure of Eliot's poem-and 4Modern British Literature, 1, No. 1 (Fall 1976), 23. 5Modern Poetry and the Tradition (Chapel Hill: Univ. of North Carolina Press, 1939), p. 167.

MODERNISM 1 15</page><page sequence="4">of many other modernist poems and novels-is based on what I propose to call absolute irony: the conception of equal and opposed possibilities held in a state of total poise, or, more briefly still, the shape of an indestructible, unresolvable paradox.7 In speaking of closure and in addressing myself more generally to the form of The Waste Land, I may seem to be edging toward a notion of reflexiveness. But this is not what I'm after, at least not if one defines the terms in the usual way, as Maurice Beebe does when he writes: "Modernist art turns back upon itself and is largely concerned with its own creation and composition."8 To a degree, no doubt, one can read Eliot's poem in this way-specifically as a ratification of the mythic method Eliot describes in his essay on Ulysses and thus as an affirmation of art.9 But it is more to the point to see in the reflexiveness that inevitably follows from nonresolution a reference back not to the artwork-whether as a self-sustaining or as a self-defining creation-but, more intimately, to an informing con- sciousness in a peculiar state of crisis: that crisis of profound and radical indecision to which "The Hollow Men" speaks so cogently. The reference to "paralysed force" in the first section of that poem predicts the ubiquitous "Shadow" of the last, which, while it defines the familiar action-impeding mechanism of self-consciousness in twentieth-century literature, maps as well the anterior field of consciousness itself. Which is to say that, if (as phenomenologists hold) consciousness is always consciousness of something, then Eliot's Shadow, relentlessly falling "Between the desire / And the spasm / Between the potency / And the existence" (p. 59), testifies to the frustration of the natural, intentional relation between self and world. Furthermore, what is true of this poem is even truer of The Waste Land, to which the metaphor of hollowness applies with still 7Paul De Man in "The Rhetoric of Temporality," Interpretation: Theory and Practice, ed. Charles S. Singleton (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1969), pp. 173- 209, uses the phrase "absolute irony," which he derives from Baudelaire's "comique absolu," to mean something very different from what I intend. See p. 198 of his essay. I have discussed absolute irony more briefly in "Depths and Surfaces: Dimensions of Forsterian Irony," English Literature in Transition, 16, No. 4 (1973), 257-74.

For from the conflict of disjunc- tion and unity within the work-the opposed visions that absolute irony contains but does not resolve-there is generated a sense of acute negation: the estrangement, brought about by the inability to act (or, in a manner of speaking, by the enactment of a non-act), of consciousness from the world in which it is, to speak phenomenologi- cally again, willy-nilly incarnated. Seen in this perspective, modernist depth-the primary target perhaps of the postmodern reaction- becomes a sign and, more, a space of absence, absence the figuration of desire, and desire the expressive form both of the poem and of the eternally arrested dialectic that, opening out onto the absence it creates, constitutes its shaping center. At this point, it is hardly possible not to acknowledge what must in any case be clear, namely, that many of the terms I have been using were given special prominence and (some would say) notoriety by Cleanth Brooks in a series of essays during the 1930s and 40s.10 Furthermore, however long and vexed the history of words like irony and paradox, it was, for most of us writing today, Brooks who made them current; and the debt needs to be acknowledged. My own aim, then, in stating my disagreements, is not to launch yet another full- scale attack on the New Criticism-the current hectic pursuit, as Oscar Wilde might just conceivably have said, of the unfashionable by the unreadable. It is, rather, to uncover the guiding principles of Brook's critical enterprise, which, like all such principles, time invariably reduces to the status of unproved assumptions. Those assumptions I want to glance at now, taking them in what seems, from the perspective of the late seventies, to be an order of ascending vulnerability. 11 To begin with: the notion of complexity. As I indicated in my 10Besides Modern Poetry and the Tradition, I will be discussing The Well Wrought Urn (1947); rpt. New York: Harcourt, Brace and World-Harvest Books, 1975) and "Irony as a Principle of Structure" (1949), in Twentieth Century Criticism: The Major Statements, eds. William J. Handy and Max Westbrook (New York: Free Press, 1974), pp. 59-70. The book and the essay will be referred to, respectively, as WWU and IPS. 11For a more extensive treatment of Brooks than mine, see Paul Bov6's stimulating and thoughtful essay, "Cleanth Brooks and Modem Irony: A Kierke- gaardian Critique," Boundary 2, 4, No. 3 (Spring 1976), 727-59. Reading Bov6's essay after I had completed my own, I discovered that mine overlaps with his at a number of points, but his implies in many ways a different conception of modernism from the one I am arguing for here. MODERNISM 1 17</page><page sequence="6">discussion of The Waste Land, the poet must, according to Brooks, provide the effect at least of "chaotic experience." The better the poet, the greater his ability to recognize and articulate "conflicting elements" (MPT, p. 37), the "discordant" (MPT, p. 40), "the amorphous and heterogeneous and contradictory" (MPT, p. 43). In other words, the poem's method deserves praise in proportion to its ability to take into account, richly and fully, incongruities and tensions, qualification and conflict-so much so that Brooks is led to praise poetry "in which the opposition of the impluses which are united is extreme" (MPT, p. 42; my italics) and Murray Krieger is led to comment that, for Brooks, "the more complexity the better, so that this theory easily lends itself to the sanctioning of complexity for complexity's sake."12 Nevertheless, I suspect that most modernists would, at this stage of his argument, agree with Brooks, given their sense of the world's disorder; and so too, allowing for a looser, untidier definition of complexity, would many postmodern artists. It is no accident, after all, that Robert Venturi's antimodernist mani- festo, which quotes liberally from Brooks, is called Complexity and Contradition in Architecture. Complexity, however, is only the base of Brooks's aesthetic pyramid, and as soon as one begins to examine more closely the defining and controlling shape of complexity-to speak paradoxically of paradox-the lines begin to taper to their inevitable close. In the broadest sense, paradox is defined by Brooks as "a device for contrasting the conventional views of a situation, or the limited and special view of it such as those taken in practical and scientific discourse, with a more inclusive view" (WWU, p. 257). But that formulation only hints at a fact demonstrable everywhere in Brooks's essays and especially in The Well Wrought Urn: namely, that the contrasts and contradictions Brooks typically concerns himself with are only ostensible. Over and again, his metaphors of tension and conflict carry with them the same revealing qualification. We are directed not to the genuinely but to "the apparently contradictory and conflicting elements of experience" (WWU, p. 214; my italics). So it is, after all, seeming paradox that interests Brooks; not the irrefran- gibly self-contradictory oppositions of the perfected dilemma but the provisional, melting balance of parts in search of a combinative 12The New Apologists for Poetry (1956; rpt.

Paradox is, finally, "the assertion of the union of opposites" (WWU, p. 213.). And, in fact, it is the search for union that unifies Brooks's own essays, that furnishes them with their telos and their motive force. One has only to note in passing the words that repeatedly thread themselves through his discourse-oneness, fusion, resolution, syn- thesis, harmony, and so on-to recognize that complexity and paradox subserve the ultimate goal of unity, that their intensity guarantees the richness of "an achieved harmony" (WWU, p. 195). More is at stake, however. The writer who manages "to fuse the conflicting elements [of experience] in a harmonious whole" (MPT, p. 37) enables the critic, the contextual critic, "to find a criterion in the organization of the poem itself by assessing the relative complexity of the unifying attitude-the power of the tensions involved in it, the scope of the reconciliation which it is able to make, etc." (WWU, p. 256). But Brooks's criterion is not, in fact, an inherent property of the poem, rather, the poem provides an occasion for the critical detection of a hypothetical order, a "truth" he locates in the very nature of things. "The characteristic unity of a poem," Brooks writes, anticipa- tings McGrath,". .. lies in the unification of attitudes into a hierarchy subordinated to a total and governing attitude" (WWU, pp. 206-07; my italics). The key words of the quotation tell their own story clearly enough. What is implied is not simply a notion of harmony and coherence but a carefully graded, ranged and arranged relationship of part to part and parts to whole. Brooks's model of organic form in its omniverous, imperious resolutions, closes the door not only against time, as Spanos alleges, and against more casual conceptions of order and form (a story by, say, Barthelme or Coover), but also against the intransigence of unreconciled consciousness, the image of that genuine paradox Brooks persistently dissolves in the acid bath of aesthetically mastered experience. I shall return to paradox later on, but for the moment it will be more useful to follow Brooks to the end of his argument or rather, since we have arrived at the apex of unity which crowns the whole, to attend to the luminous glow of approbation that surrounds the resolved, perfected poem. No one, I think, will want to quarrel with Brooksian words like sensitivity and richness. Sincerity is perhaps a bit out of fashion, as is depth. Coherence and integrity, if too narrowly construed, may be expected to raise hackles. But the most problematic and troublesome of Brooks's terms of praise are surely the all too hearty and conclusive toughminded, healthy, and, particularly, MODERNISM 19</page><page sequence="8">mature. This is no doubt unfair. The words I've cited are meant to stand in opposition to a sensibility that is "merely callow, glib, and sentimental" (IPS, p. 62), and since those unflattering adjectives are, in turn, directly contrasted with the principle of irony, it will be most appropriate to come at maturity by way of irony itself. Irony has, of course, several related meanings in Brooks's writings. Its function is "to make reservations, to notice by implication 'the other side' of the matter" (MPT, p. 30); it is "the most general term that we have for the kind of qualification which the various elements in a context receive from the context. . . . Moreover, irony is our most general term for indicating [the] recognition of incongruities" (WWU, p. 209). But the most comprehensive of Brooks's definitions claims for irony a good deal more. At issue is "a poetry which does not leave out what is apparently hostile to its dominant tone and which, because it is able to fuse the irrelevant and discordant, has come to terms with itself and is invulnerable to irony" (IPS, p. 62). Now, Brooks's apparent paradox-the notion that only the fully ironic poem can withstand irony-is both ingenious and, at the most general level, persuasive, but the implications of various details of his definition are another matter. One can agree that The Waste Land or, to take another example, A Passage to India is a fully ironic work in that each "carries within its own structure the destructive elements," that is, takes account of "complementary impulses" and "correlative aspects of the experience" being explored, but it is something else again to assert that the writer "has reconciled [the structure] to [the destructive elements]" (MPT, p. 44). Certainly, both Eliot and Forster have managed brilliantly to contain, formally, aesthetically, the internal pressures of their works; but containment is not reconciliation, and still less is it a fusion of the discordant. Furthermore, it can be argued that Forster and Eliot "come to terms" with their paradoxes only in the sense that they, or their works, acknowledge them by expressing the dilemma into which experience shapes itself. And what results, as I suggested earlier, is a state not of mutual balance and support but of fierce, unreconciled opposition. In effect, then, we are faced with two different models, superficially kin but, in the final analysis, subtly and determinedly at odds. In Brooks's, the writer, all passion spent, calmly stands above the experience he has wrought into unity, the master of all he surveys. In the other, the writer stands not only above but, as it were, against experience, his poem or novel indicating not a mastery of the world but a defensive maneuver prompted by it, a tacit admission of fail- ure to come to terms with its complexity. The second model is, in other 20 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="9">words, acephalous: the ultimate synthesis absents itself; like Forster's teasing Krishna, it "neglects to come."13 But what is it exactly that accounts for these differences and makes Brooks's criticism a not altogether reliable guide to much of modernist literature? It is tempting to answer summarily that there is a touch of complacency in his views-about art and about life as well. Certainly, he exhibits a somewhat naive delight in complexity, which is the very antithesis of most modern writers' gloomy perceptions of disorder: "these chasms," as Virginia Woolf puts it, "in the continuity of our ways."14 Krieger comments aptly on Brooks's "unchecked multiplication of complexities, hell-bent for chaos" (p. 135). The last phrase is especially to the point. For writers like the Forster of A Passage to India, exclusion and inclusion are twin dangers, and the false order of the first is matched by the potential formlessness of the second. Brooks's disdain for imposed form, on the other hand, calls forth no answering suspicion of complexity-and for an obvious reason: complications and contradictions unnumbered are, for him, always susceptible of resolution-certain, if hard-won-in the ample embrace of organic form. Organic form is a tricky concept, however. To begin with, one might argue that the most inclusive works of modernism-Ulysses, To the Lighthouse, The Waves, even The Waste Land-come closest to violating Brooks's inviolable union of form and content; that precisely those novels and poems whose internal complexities are most extreme exhibit the kind of structure Brooks most scorns (" 'form' conceived as a kind of container, a sort of beautified envelope" [WWU, p. 226]), thereby ratifying Forster's insight that all- inclusiveness, or chaos, invites the imposition of order fully as much as order imposed from without falsifies the fullness of experience. But there is another and more important distinction to be drawn, which requires further definition. If organic form implies no more than that "each part modifies and is modified by the whole" (IPS, p. 66); that the genuinely (as opposed to the apparently) irrelevant has no place in art; that, finally, structure evolves (or is 13Some of I.A. Richards' formulations about the nature of irony in Principles of Literary Criticism (1925; rpt. New York: Harcourt, Brace and World-Harvest Books, n.d.) seem to come closer to what I am describing. But the context in which they appear-psychological rather than formal-limits their value for my argument. See pp. 247-53.

MODERNISM 21</page><page sequence="10">discovered) in relation to the exigencies of the individual work and not in accordance with some external set of rules (the three unities, say), then most modernists would readily agree. Forster, for example, opposing rhythm to pattern, asserting that order is "something evolved from within, not something imposed from without . . an internal stability, a vital harmony" and that "a work of art-whatever else it may be-is a self-contained entity," Forster in this sense is an organicist. But-and it is a crucial but-for Forster, as for other members of Bloomsbury, the order of art stands in contrast to the disorder of life-"It is the one orderly product which our muddling' race has produced"15-whereas for Brooks, the poet's task is not only "finally to unify experience. He must return to us the unity of experience itself as man knows it in his own experience" (WWU, pp. 212-13; my italics).16 With this contrast, we come to what is crucial in the metaphor of organicism. In Brooks's case, the theory of the organic work of art rests securely on a Coleridgean belief in nature itself as organic. But is it possible to share Brooks's view of art while simultaneously asserting the disappearance (or death) of God and the disorderliness of life? Well, yes, as Forster's case proves: the structures based on belief may long, if not indefinitely, outlast the belief that once informed them; but poised as they are over a void, they inevitably become both precarious and rigid. The New Critical demand "that poetry be 'mature,' that it see all around any experience and not cheat our life of its complexity, our world of its body" (NAP, p. 132) evokes in Forster, by the time of A Passage to India, not a euphoric response to complexity but a feeling of metaphysical disgust. The detachment and objectivity that are two more of Brooks's hallmarks of the truly ironic work (IPS, p. 62) are for Forster-and for Eliot and Joyce, Woolf and Huxley, Auden and Isherwood-signs rather of a failure to engage the world: a standing apart from experience, which inevitably reflects back from the characters who dramatize this failure to their authors, who repeatedly and unmistakably betray in their narrative and poetic strategies their resemblances to their fictional creations. Shall we, then, indeed can we, apply the criterion of maturity to 15"Art for Art's Sake," Two Cheers for Democracy (New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1951), pp. 90, 89, and 92. See the unpublished Ph.D. dissertation by Thomas M. McLaughlin, "Approaches to Order in Bloomsbury Criticism," Temple University, 1976. 16Compare Krieger's reading of this passage, p. 193. 22 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="11">works which, far from expressing the harmonious unity of the assured and settled mind, reveal instead, as a response to complexity and irresolution in the face of paradox, an overwhelming sense of nausea; which view art as, at best, an ambiguous breakwater against the turbid flow of life? "Through control," Krieger writes, "[the poem] disdains the messiness of experience" (p. 26). But disdain is the prerogative of confidence and certainty. Calling unity itself into doubt, modernism- or at least those modernist works structured on the principle of absolute irony-expresses a sort of brave helplessness; and perhaps if one wants an honorific to apply to these writers, the appropriate term is not mature but heroic. What we confront finally is a different kind of complexity: the heroism of consciousness making art of its own uncertainty and expressing in its very form, in the express rejection of an easy resolution, the difficult aesthetics of crisis. II Setting himself in opposition to Mies van der Rohe's orthodox modernism, Robert Venturi, by no means the most radical of postmodern theorists, writes as follows: "Mies refers to a need to 'create order out of the desperate confusion of our times.' But [Louis] Kahn has said 'by order I do not mean orderliness.' Should we not resist bemoaning confusion? Should we not look for meaning in the complexities and contradictions of our times and acknowledge the limitations of systems? . . . When circumstances defy order, order should bend or break: anomalies and uncertainties give validity to architecture."17 Venturi's credo is useful in two ways. First of all, despite the diversity of beliefs I've already acknowledged as a feature of postmodernism, his words seem to me to articulate congently the ethos of the movement: the perception, to start with, of experience as random and contingent ("confusion," "uncertainties") rather than- the modernist view-simply fragmented; further, an accompanying impulse not only to recognize but to accept variety and confusion; and, finally, the elaboration of an ethic of participation: the desire for experience unmediated by the moral and aesthetic imperatives of modernism. In the second place and as a corollary: if, as I believe, the nature of crisis becomes fully apparent only in its aftermath, only, that is to say, when a new path, among many possible and possibly unforeseen, has been chosen, than Venturi's statements, in 17Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture (New York: Museum of Modern Art, 1968), pp. 46-47. MODERNISM 1 23</page><page sequence="12">their reactive force, help to establish more clearly the configuration of the modernist crisis. Unwilling or unable to accept, even as their sense of disbelief in all objective forms of order (exclusive and inclusive) grows, the consequences of their disbelief, the modernists refuse to admit the "limitation of all orders composed by man" (p. 47). Resisting Venturi's--and Kahn's-looser, more modest expecta- tions, they cannot imagine the breaking or bending or, better still, the transfiguration of the order for which they continue to rage. And so they remain, as we now see, captives of an ideal less of order than of orderliness, asserting, in the teeth of a world gone inorganic and dead, those stubborn paradoxes that elevate visions of disorder to the unsteady heights of formal symmetry. Not, of course, as I've already stipulated, all modernists and not even, to come closer to my subject, all ironists of this century. A more genetic approach to the problem makes immediately apparent the fact that irony, though it pervades the century, is far from monolithic. Satiric irony, for example, persists, however attenuated by the long decline of reason as man's master faculty and, more importantly (since twentieth-century satire tends in any case-with a few notable exceptions like Wyndham Lewis-to substitute primitivist for rational norms), by the evaporation of a "common sense" of things. But satire is, relatively speaking, a minor form in modern times, its notion of correctible error or folly superseded by what D.C. Muecke describes as "an awareness of life as being fundamentally and inescapably at odds with itself or with the world at large."18 Muecke's "general irony," which, as he acknowledges, is by no means a twentieth- century discovery, seems to me a reasonable and suggestive account of the basic form of irony in the modernist period; and in what follows I want to adopt his term, making some changes in its focus and taking it to contrast not only (as he means it to) with the specific ironies of satire but also with the more extreme and critical stage of absolute irony that develops from it.19 Muecke speaks of "one great incongruity," which is the basis for 18 The Compass of Irony (London: Methuen, 1969), p. 123. Hereafter, I will be quoting from Muecke's briefer version of that book, Irony (London: Methuen, 1970), referred to as I. 19Citing Friedrich Schlegel ("Irony is a form of paradox") and Connop Thirlwall, Muecke raises the possibility of what I have been calling genuine paradox (I, p. 22), but he goes on to say that "this type of irony may be seen as consisting, none the less, of a contrasting reality and appearance" (p. 31). 24 | CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="13">general irony: "the appearance of self-valued and subjectively free but temporally finite egos in a universe that seems to be utterly alien, utterly purposeless, completely deterministic, and incomprehensibly vast" (I, p. 68). The formulation makes an important point, but it may take for granted too great a consciousness of what it describes. The fact is that for most people Muecke's incongruity-or the awareness of it-is a more instinctive matter. By which I mean that theoretical ironic disparities are, again for most people, generally hypostatized as intrinsic features of the world or of the psyche. Thus Woolf's "chasms," and thus the gaps and discontinuities that modernist writers habitually explore and express, thematically and through their various techniques. It is not, then, so much a matter of "two systems which simply do not gear together" (I, p.68) as of a world, inner or outer, perceived as inherently disjunctive. Muecke would say, I suspect, that I am one of those robbing irony of "the 'central' feature of a contrasting appearance and reality" (I, p. 32); and in some respects at least, he would be right. My point is this: that as irony ceases to be merely the instrument of satire and becomes instead something more autonomous, it projects the double- ness that characterizes it as a trope into a lateral form, a disjunctive form, which creates in turn those attitudes and perspectives-distance and detachment, for example-that we associate with irony as a strategy of noninvolvement or disillusion or defense. These various ways of reacting (or not reacting) are, however, secondary effects of something more basic: a way of "seeing" the world. Postsatiric irony seems to me, then, as it develops in the twentieth century from its roots in German romantic theory, first and foremost a vision of existence. But where shall we situate it? Muecke's contrast of reality and appearance suggests that we place it precisely in the difference between man's perceiving consciousness and the world that is external to him. But if, as Merleau-Ponty holds, there exists "a natal pact between our body and the world, between ourselves [that is, consciousness] and our body," then these traditionally opposed elements are in fact inextricably entwined.20 Or, to put it another way, the world both determines and is determined by consciousness, and whether we speak of a perception of disjunction or of a disjunct world, we are saying, effectively, the same thing. In short, Muecke's 20Maurice Merleau-Ponty, "A Prospectus of His Work," trans. Arleen B. Dallery, in The Primacy of Perception, ed. James M. Edie (Evanston: Northwestern Univ. Press, 1964), p. 6. MODERNISM I 25</page><page sequence="14">contrast is voided in a "world [that] is," to quote Merleau-Ponty again, "not what I think, but what I live through."21 Furthermore, if what we are discussing is perception, an immediate response to the world that precedes conceptualization, then the fact of intention (as opposed to the phenomenological notion of intentionality), which Wayne Booth makes central to his rhetorical investigation of irony, becomes theoretically, if not necessarily, irrelevant.22 Which is to say that the ironist is not, in the first instance, the manipulator (though he may be that ultimately) but the perceiver of disparities, inscribing his pre-critical vision in the form of his work. We must look then, finally, to structure, as Brooks maintains, or, more appropriately, to acts of language to locate irony, for if irony is preeminently a responsive vision, still the vision must speak-be disclosed (or, as Mark Schorer maintains, be discovered)-in order to be recognized. Does this mean that, having set aside Brooks's ideal of achieved unity, one must adopt his principle of complexity? To do so, Muecke maintains-in speaking of the contextual model, which, for Brooks, underlies the valorization of complexity-is to give in to "a tendency to stretch the concept of irony to the point of making it the essential or distinguishing quality of imaginative literature" (I, p. 10). But in fact, modem art (modernist and postmodernist) is over- whelmingly ironic, however one chooses to define the word-and it is hardly surprising that it is so, given twentieth-century life for its context. The problem may lie, rather, in the definition of complexity, for what we require, in attempting to recognize and identify modernist irony, is not a criticism that attends simply or primarily to however many mutually modifying and qualifying elements, which can and, for Brooks, have to be made to coexist organically-the poem which "must perforce dramatize the oneness of the experience, even though paying tribute to its diversity" (WWU, p. 213; my italics). We need instead to recognize specifically those techniques that translate the gaps and discontinuities in experience, that stress its broken edges and sharp corners, the scars of division and the palpable traces of absence-such stylistic and narrative devices as, for example, parataxis, montage, multiple point of view, the stress on 21Phenomenology of Perception, trans. Colin Smith (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1962), pp. xvi'-xvii. Parenthetical page references, preceded by PhP, will be to this edition. 221 am referring, of course, to Booth's A Rhetoric of Irony (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1974). I have commented at greater length on the book in my review of it in the Journal of Modern Literature, 4, No. 5 (1976: 1975 Supplement), 942-43. 26 1 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="15">discrete moments, or, in the case of absolute irony, genuine paradox. Which is to say that it is in the formal revelation of the failure to come to terms with experience that modernist irony makes manifest its bleak intuitions. So then, neither Muecke's contrast of reality and appearance nor Booth's stress on intention (rich and complex though their arguments certainly are), and still less Brooks's mandatory reduction of disorder to unity, seems to me to make sufficiently visible the contours of irony in this century. If I am right about the way perception is encoded in modernist works of art, then the clue to the ironic vision lies, available to the reader, in forms that render not merely the fact of disparity but its informing principles, not only the unconnected elements of life but, more tellingly, the disconnection itself: those unbridgeable spaces that define as they disfigure the map of modern life. In locating modernist irony in a vision of things side by side and not (as Muecke does) one behind the other and in finding its essence in the articulation of disconnection, I don't mean to rob human beings altogether of their sense of doubleness, which may be, after all, the chief token of living in a fallen world. In fact, I want to argue that all irony, regarded as a perceptual encounter with the world, generates in response to its vision of disparity (or in some cases is generated by) a complementary, more conceptual vision of wholeness or singleness, which I have elsewhere called the anironic.23 Thus, if in satiric irony the world is perceived as deviating or lapsed from some pre-existent norm, the anironic offers a contrasting societal or at least earthly vision of integration and connection, harmony and coherence: paradise regained and made resonably or imaginatively terrestrial- where, to use Pope's words: "Earth smiles around, with boundless bounty blest, / And Heaven beholds its image in his breast."24 By contrast, the modernist perception of fragmentation is balanced by an anironic vision of oneness or fusion: the jagged earth transcended, as in Yeats's Byzantium or, as in Mrs. Ramsay's "wedge-shaped core of darkness," interiorized and seemingly stilled. Does this formulation sneak an irony based on reality and appearance in by the back door after expelling it through the front? I think not. What it does, in denying fixed, essential realities and thus, too, illusory appearances, is to allow the coexistence of two mental 23"Desire and Consciousness: The 'Anironic' Forster," Novel, 9, No. 2 (Winter 1976), 114-29. 24An Essay on Man, IV, 11. 371-72. MODERNISM | 27</page><page sequence="16">structures or levels (which in satiric irony are perhaps one): an intuitive grasp of disparity (the ironic) and a secondary, frequently more self-conscious way of coping with disparity by creating alterna- tives (the anironic) to it. I'll return, less theoretically, to the anironic in a moment. The distinction between satiric and modernist or disjunctive irony can be left now. But the further division of the latter into general and absolute requires more detailed comment. To begin with, which works shall we agree on as representing general irony or, better still, what characters inhabit its unsettled regions? Prufrock, of course, and, to take less familiar examples, the heroines of Jean Rhys's novels, but the most striking may be Ford Madox Ford's John Dowell. Ejected from the world he has always known, a world, to use his words, of permanence and stability, he exposes himself as a man whose sensitivity has been unequal to his experience, who, faced with the sudden discovery that there are no certainties, can only repeat over and over throughout his long monologue: "I don't know, I know nothing. I am very tired."25 Unprepared for what the twentieth century reveals to him, that the world lacks order and coherence and meaning, he is yet, in his dim, Laodicean way, the unwitting embodiment as well as the victim of his times. Perhaps his most revealing remark comes when, after his description of one of the novel's crucial incidents, he writes: "I was aware of something treacherous, something frightful, something evil in the day. I can't define it and can't find a simile for it" (p. 44). At which point he proceeds, as he constantly does, to look for one. The simile, that curious figure of speech which acknowledges, more, insists on, difference even while asserting likeness, which stresses the gap-the "like" or "as" or, Dowell's favorite, the still further estranging "as if'-between the things compared, the simile is in many ways the most tangible representation of Dowell's search for meaning in a world whose parts, mirroring his own flat, discrete, and fragmentary perceptions, stubbornly refuse to cohere. That his metaphors are, by contrast, totally conventional only underlines the point. Residual images of a lost order-Paradise is his favorite-they function as anironic contrasts to his habitual sense of disconnection, his increas- ingly gloomy vision of "broken,tumultuous, agonized, and unromantic lives" (pp. 237-38). Broken lives is in fact what Dowell's story is about, and his chief effort in tortuously reconstructing them is to find some meaning 25 The Good Soldier (New York: Vintage Books, 1960), p. 245. 28 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="17">among the facts he recounts, to uncover or recover the continuity he once knew. He fails of course and remains to the end trapped in his shattered world, kept from total collapse only by a vestigial sense of duty and by his ludicrous identification with Edward Ashburnham. At one point, however, Dowell's irony threatens to evolve into a more complex form of response. Near the beginning of the novel, reflecting on the "little four-square coterie" (p. 5) of himself, his wife, and the Ashburnhams, he says, "our intimacy was like a minuet" (p. 6) and then, shortly, goes on to contradict himself: "No, by God, it is false! It wasn't a minuet that we stepped; it was a prison-a prison full of screaming hysterics. .... And yet I swear by the sacred name of my creator that it was true. It was true sunshine; the true music" (p. 7). For a moment Dowell holds in balance, as equally valid possibilities, the visions of hell and heaven, to use his metaphors, which elsewhere he opposes as reality (the ironic) and dream (the anironic). Here both together comprise his primary perception of the world, and we thus come to an adumbration of absolute irony. Dowell resumes his refrain, however-"I know nothing-nothing in the world-of the hearts of men" (p. 7)--and we may leave him now to concentrate on the concept he briefly suggests. To put the matter schematically, what I am suggesting is this: if general irony is based on a perception of disjunction and implies a countervision of fusion, absolute irony joins these elements in a more comprehensively ironic view. In their interactivity, the world presents itself as more tensive and paradoxical, consciousness as more sophisticated and, in some cases, more self-aware. Dowell's hopeless confusion gives way to the self-consciousness of Cortazar's Horacio Oliveira, "weighing and accepting too readily the yes and no of everything, becoming a sort of inspector of scales."26 But more is at stake. As the ironic and anironic of the earlier stage knit together in a new configuration, they assume, each of them, a more radical shape. Absolute irony, as I hinted earlier, embraces simultaneously the extreme of, on the one side, a world in which, as Forster's Mrs. Moore learns, "everything exists, nothing has value" (PI, p. 149)--a world, that is, in a state of total chaos-and, on the other, of a unity so inclusive as to be, for its part too, hardly distinguishable from chaos. But what then of the anironic vision that complements absolute irony, if absolute irony has absorbed into itself the dream of oneness, 26Julio Cortaizar, Hopscotch, trans. Gregory Rabassa (1966; rpt. New York: Avon Books, 1966), p. 27. MODERNISM 29</page><page sequence="18">the desire man feels, Dowell says, "to lose his identity, to be enveloped, to be supported" (p. 115)? The answer is tricky. In fact, at the level of absolute irony, that desire remains, but it is more narrowly and perhaps desperately channeled into an exclusive identification with art: "music heard so deeply," as Eliot writes in "The Dry Salvages," "That it is not heard at all, but you are the music / While the music lasts" (p. 136; my italics). Of course, art serves not infrequently as an ideal complementary to the vision of general irony as well, but not-and this is my point-in the same way. As the anironic of absolute irony, the modernist goal of fusion not only becomes specifically aesthetic; it is, as it were, transformed from the theoretical image of desire to its explicit form. Yeats's two Byzantium poems will help to demonstrate the difference. In "Sailing to Byzantium," the "artifice of eternity" is the ideal consciousness generated to express its dissatisfaction with the world it remains part of, an ideal correlative to the others Yeats expresses in the poem, innocence, tradition, custom, and so on. But in the later poem, Byzantium is the shape of consciousness itself. From within the city, functioning here not as one of the poem's symbols but as its symbolic form, the speaker observes both the furies of complexity and the flood-breaking smithies of the Emperor; and, unable to choose between the extremes the poem projects or to resolve their antinomy, he materializes and stabilizes the dilemma through art. But it is the poet's art, not the Emperor's, that achieves this stability. The Emperor, violent and dynamic, is part of the paradox; the poet's art, the poem itself, is its transcendence. Is it any wonder that modernism speaks so insistently of anonymity and impersonality, and modernist critics of the intentional fallacy and the loss of the self? Art is, finally, the exiled artist's home, in which, remaining true to his perceptions, he is yet able-or so it seems-to bring consciousness to rest, its desire fulfilled in the attainment of order: "a world, or mode of existence, " Val6ry says in describing poetry's effect, "of complete harmony."27 But this transcendence, the pouring of paralyzed consciousness into the shape of the artwork it merges with, is at a cost. The situation that seems to Dowell true music is, viewed differently, a prison; and likewise, the absolute ironist's victory is, effectively, his defeat. For in seeking its loss, the self in reality finds itself implacably mirrored back by the form of the artwork, which, though sought as a liberation from consciousness, instead confirms consciousness and constrains it to see 27Quoted by Gerald L. Bruns in his book Modern Poetry and the Idea of Language (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1974), p. 81. 30 1 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="19">itself as precisely what it desired not to be in the first place: "estranged from the whole world to which [it] belongs." The words are Kierkegaard's and it is worth quoting a good part of the passage in which they appear. He is speaking of Socrates as ironist: "Thus he elevates himself higher and higher, becoming ever lighter as he rises, seeing all things disappear beneath him from his ironical bird's eye perspective, while he himself hovers above them in ironic satisfaction borne by the absolute self-consistency of the infinite negativity within him. Thus he becomes estranged from the whole world to which he belongs (however much he may still belong to it in another sense), the contemporary consciousness affords him no predicates, ineffable and indeterminate he belongs to a different formation."28 It is not necessary to pursue Kierkegaard's argument here. I want simply to pause for a moment over what his words might suggest in the context of this essay. The "different formation" he attributes to the ironist and views in terms of an "infinite negativity with him" I would update and transform into that crisis of consciousness in a state of radical indecision to which I've already referred. Unable to make sense of the world but unwilling to forego the ideal model of orderliness, the absolute ironist folds back on himself in the sanctuary of his art. Finally, the ironic and the anironic converge, and he finds in his supposed release only the inexorable reflection of his own equivocation. Kierkegaard's metaphors of position are particularly suggestive as a description of the ironist's perspective. If general irony is distant and detached, absolute irony is more distant still, "hovering" in fact. The last image brings directly to mind one of Virginia Woolf's stories, which, because it exemplifies almost diagrammatically what I have been trying to expound here as theory, I want to look at now in some detail. The story, or sketch, or fiction-it is difficult to decide how exactly to name a piece of slightly over three hundred words that is virtually without characters or incidents-"Monday or Tuesday" has received little attention and less praise from critics, though Woolf apparently thought highly enough of it to use its title for the 1921 volume in which it first appeared. Perhaps it is best to regard the work as a parable: an exploration of various ways of perceiving and responding to the world and, as such, an invaluable guide to Woolf's preoccupations at least through the early thirties. Brief though it is, "Monday or Tuesday" is anything but simple in structure. Four short paragraphs, which enact a typically modernist dilemma, are framed 28Soren Kierkegaard, The Concept of Irony, trans. Lee M. Capel (New York: Harper and Row, 1965), p. 221. MODERNISM 1 31</page><page sequence="20">by two others, in which both the narrator's perspective and the objects that solicit her attention shift so violently as to suggest that the central problem of the middle section has been, as is in fact the case, somehow bypassed or transcended. I'll return to the frame in a while: it is between the narrative extremes that the initial perplexity defines itself. The first three of these paragraphs describe the desire (the narrator's, presumably, but perhaps that of human beings in general) for truth: "Desiring truth, awaiting it, laboriously distilling a few words, for ever desiring. .. ."29 The phrase "laboriously distilling" suggests the attempted approach: a conscious and painstaking, active and repeated effort to extract, drop by drop, the essence of phenomena, the reality underlying appearance. The subject of the distillation is a series of impressionisti- cally rendered cityscapes and desultory conversations, which reveals everywhere discord and conflict, triviality and bustle. But from time to time beauty too emerges, for this is, on the whole, as compared with the "Time Passes" section of To the Lighthouse, say, one of Woolf's more benign visions of disconnection and confusion. Still, even the moments of beauty constitute only so many more distractions in what Woolf was to describe a few years later as "an age of fragments."30 More and more, as "wheels strike divergently" and "omnibuses conglomerate in conflict" and nameless Londoners exchange vaporous remarks, not only the quest for truth but even the ability to sustain the quest is called into doubt until, in the last paragraph of the three, truth appears one final time as an interrogative afterthought: "Flaunted, leaf-light, drifting at corners, blown across the wheels, silver-splashed, home or not home, gathered, scattered, squandered in separate scales, swept up, down, torn, sunk, assem- bled-and truth?" The passage is remarkable for the way in which it suggests the defeat of the narrator's project and her consequent disappearance, at least as a conscious seeker after truth. Lacking any finite verbs, almost devoid of nouns (all, except truth, appear in prepositional phrases), the sentence, or rather the fragment of a sentence, describes a world of pure appearance, in which truth, substantial and final, has no place or part. 29A Haunted House and Other Short Stories (New York: Harcourt, Brace and World-Harvest Books, 1949), p. 6. Since the whole of the brief piece appears on pp. 6-7, I have not documented my further references to it. 30"How It Strikes a Contemporary," Collected Essays (New York: Harcourt, Brace and World, 1967), II, 156. 32 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="21">But the sentence is not only an ending. Standing between the two preceding paragraphs-in which words seek to name and thus stabilize objects and actions, holding them in place so the narrator can penetrate from shifting surface to stable depth-standing between these and the passage that follows, in which words become trans- parent and suggestive, it provides a transition to another mode of response. "Now to recollect by the fireside," the section begins, and the verb intimates not only, as compared with the activity of "laboriously distilling," a more meditative, intuitive process but, in addition, a summoning together of the self, an attempt, literally to re- collect what has been dispersed in the phenomenal world as a result of the search for truth. But in fact, though the narrator, first reading and then, book fallen, voyaging freely like Mrs. Ramsay through inner space, traverses vast, exotic oceans and continents, she attains only what William Troy, in speaking of Mrs. Ramsay, called "the range of implicit experience. "31 The passive surrender of consciousness to less logical and analytical forms of mental activity-the narrator's word is "closeness"-achieves, to be sure, a oneness or fusion of sorts (the intimacy of consciousness with its own imaginings or, in the final analysis, with itself), but it comes no nearer to capturing reality, as the final words of the story (the story within the story)-"truth? or now, content with closeness?"-make clear. For we are left at the end with a question and with a disjunction: that equal poise of opposites once more. There are, of course, various ways of translating or rephrasing the disjunction-objectivity and subjectivity, say, or, to be more Woolfian about it, night and day, or even Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay-but what matters is that the terms are perfectly balanced. Opposed and yet, subtly, effectively, the same-truth is engulfed by, while closeness evades, facticity-the two approaches describe twin failures to deal successfully with the phenomenal world to which the title, itself disjunctive, refers. The story does not, however, acknowledge failure. What it does instead is present simultaneously valid possibilities, transforming disjunction into paradox and thereby creating the conditions for absolute irony. Unable to choose between truth and closeness, the narrator arrests choice and greets the alternatives with an equal eye, as the first and last paragraphs of "Monday or Tuesday" make evident. 31"Virginia Woolf: The Novel of Sensibility," in Virginia Woolf: A Collection of Critical Essays, ed. Claire Sprague (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1971), p. 28. MODERNISM 133</page><page sequence="22">For if the sections I have so far described articulate the impasse, it is the frame that defines the narrator's final response, although obliquely. Removed as far as possible from the mundane activities of the rest of the story, the frame devotes itself to a description of the sky, "white and distant, absorbed in itself, [which] endlessly . . . covers and uncovers, moves and remains" and of a "lazy and indifferent [heron], shaking space easily from his wings, knowing his way." Whether the clouded sky, in its magisterial impartiality, is meant to suggest a constant reality hidden by the changing configura- tions of appearance; whether, to push conjecture further still, it is intended, in its self-delighting play of light and shadow, its mapping in gold and darkness of the landscape beneath it, to represent the self- sufficient, variegated world of art, I am not completely sure. But it seems to me beyond doubt that, however intended, the heron bodies forth the artist and, more, the ironic artist of Woolf's story. Lazy? Indifferent? Do the words apply? Yes, as contrasted with the descriptions of the narrator first laboriously distilling words in the search for truth and later, though more subdued, still seeking, this time for closeness. For the heron there is no search, no seeking; only casual attention to what is: the existent of which it is both part and not part. What exactly are we dealing with here? Surely, Kierkegaard's ironist, who "elevates himself higher and higher, becoming ever lighter and lighter as he rises, seeing all things disappear beneath him from his ironical bird's eye perspective." And surely too with what I have been calling the absolute ironist, "estranged from the whole world to which he belongs." Incapable of selecting either of her opposed perceptions of the world and incapable of fusing them into a Brooksian unity, the artist retreats from her paradox and from the world it figures, a remote, hovering observer now, saved from the impossible choice but condemned to its inevitable repetition. "Monday or Tuesday" is, then, a portrait of the modernist artist as absolute ironist, and in that sense it is as well a parable of the aesthetics of crisis: it presents an order, no doubt, and, in its own way, a solution, but the vision of paradox remains, unresolved and, lacking a new way of apprehending reality, unresolvable. III One other major problem remains, which leads, appropriately enough, to a critical paradox, though only, as I hope to show in examining it, an apparent one. Let me get at this by a question. If I 34 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="23">have been arguing primarily, in my attempt to establish a category of absolute irony, against New Critical assertions of resolution as the mark of the successfully ironic work, am I then committed by my opposition to defining the structure of absolute irony as not only non- resolved but open? Many critics have argued that modernist literature is, in fact, characteristically open or open-ended, and, among them, none more persuasively than Alan Friedman in his exemplary study, The Turn of the Novel, which concerns itself with the form of "an ethical vision of continual expansion and virtually unrelieved open- ness in the experience of life." "In this discussion of structure in the novel," he writes, "a form conceived as in motion and as a process, I am going to use 'closed' or 'open' to refer to the full and final shaping of the flux of experience. . . . By a closed novel, then, I mean a novel in which that underlying ethical form, the stream of conscience, is finally contained [or, as he says on the following page, "checked and brought to rest"]. By an open novel I mean a novel in which the stream of conscience is finally not contained."32 Now, if one regards the description as a comment on the twentieth century as a whole, including, as Friedman does not, postmodern fiction, it is hard to resist its general validity. But I have to add that, in those works whose structure is defined by absolute irony, we have, for reasons I shall try to specify, the exceptions that prove the rule. In such poems and novels, though resolution does not take place, expansion, as in Friedman's closed novel, is nevertheless checked-if hardly brought to rest. Still dynamic, experience is arrested in flight, made negative in a sense, by the equivocal balance of consciousness; the movement to expansion is turned back on itself, linearity made endlessly circular, the energy of the movement imploding inward and held, if not stilled, only by the exigency of form. In speaking of absolute irony, then, I mean to assert, in response to those who see the shape of modernist literature as organic, its failure to fuse its contradictory elements and, in response to those who view it as expanding, I mean equally to assert its abrupt arrest of outward or onward movement. I have admitted, however, that such works are formally closed, and I would add now that they are open as well, if openness is seen to locate itself as an irresolution within the 32 The Turn of the Novel (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1966), p. 16. See pp. xv-xvi for Friedman's distinction between his own approach and that of Robert M. Adams in Strains of Discord: Studies in Literary Openness (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell Univ. Press, 1958). MODERNISM 135</page><page sequence="24">confines of the novel or poem. For Friedman, "the expanding flux of conscience in modern fiction is left finally open . . . in one of three senses: finally uncontained, finally unreduced, or finally still expand- ing" (p. 30). In the works I am describing, it is both contained and, to that degree, reduced and, if still expanding, then in a troublingly reflexive way: desire straining against the constraining form it has itself devised as the only possible response to its impossible hope for fulfillment. So, in "Monday or Tuesday," the unanswerable question- "truth? or now, content with closeness?"-continues to echo and reecho, as the narrator transcends the open, phenomenal world and ascends to the framing order of art. Of course, Woolf is, in many ways, a special case. The endings of the middle novels-from "For there she was" to "I have had my vision" to "The waves broke on the shore"- increasingly and with increasing emphasis bolt shut the door on their questioning, meditative visions until, in The Waves, absolute irony truimphs and we are left not with "the world seen without a self" but with the self absorbed into its own world of art, the paradox of life both affirmed and denied, left behind, frozen. Friedman himself, in his remarks on To the Lighthouse, shows, I think, some discomfort with his formula: "the need to suggest a nonexistent containment," he writes, ". .. persists" (p. 33). But is it only a suggestion, and is the containment nonexistent? And might not one do better to rephrase his earlier comment-"The final attainment of the lighthouse, there in the book's world, is no containment but actually an unstopped movement of still disturbed conscience" (p. 31)-by saying that the unstopped movement of still disturbed conscience is, in fact, contained, so much so that the novel's fluid, interrogative texture is almost fatally rent? In any case, most modernist poems and novels are less obviously final in their endings, and it will be fairer to Friedman's hypothesis to test it against some other works. What of expanding experience in Yeat's "Blood and the Moon," for example? After three sections in praise of tradition and beauty and purity, Yeats reverses himself in the fourth: No matter what I said, For wisdom is the property of the dead, A something incompatible with life; and power, Like everthing that has the stain of blood, A property of the living. ... Opting for the crude energy of life, he moves toward "virtually 36 I CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="25">unrelieved openness" in every sense. But the poem does not end here. The concluding lines-"but no stain / Can come upon the visage of the moon / When it has looked in glory from a cloud"33- represent not another volte-face, still less a casual afterthought, but the acknowledgement of a paradox which turns the imagination of the poem back to the contemplation of its own unresolved but contained elements. A Passage to India illustrates the same point in a different way. Friedman's comment on the novel's ending-"This is not still another reversal of the book's direction. But it is an expansion of conscience blocked, a direction left uncertain, a new and final opening outward left incomplete" (p. 128)-is incisive and suggestive and, read purely as thematic criticism (which is not what Friedman intends), it is, I think, indisputable. The notion of expansion blocked is exactly right, but the suggestion of an opening outward, even if left incomplete (Friedman quotes Forster's dictum: "Expansion. . . . Not completion"), seems to me to misconstrue the novel's final effect. I have argued more extensively elsewhere that, from the very first sentence of the book, Forster begins to establish the focus of absolute irony.34 Here, I want simply to glance at the last paragraph: "But the horses didn't want it- they swerved apart; the earth didn't want it, sending up rocks through which riders must pass single file; the temples, the tank, the jail, the palace, the birds, the carrion, the Guest House, that came into view as they issued from the gap and saw Mau beneath: they didn't want it, they said in their hundred voices, 'No, not yet,' and the sky said, 'No, not there' " (p. 322). Certainly, the passage directs us, thematically again, toward a distant, unresolved future. The implication of another time and another place does assert itself against the cacophony of dissenting voices. But surely the passage, regarded in a more formal way, tells another story. Almost all of the effects that for Barbara Herrnstein Smith contribute to a sense of closure are present here: verbal repetitions, monosyllabic diction (there are almost four times as many monosyllables as there are polysyllabic words, and of the latter, all but one is disyllabic), formal parallelism, balance, alliteration, metrical (or in this case rhythmical) regularity, unqualified 33The Collected Poems of W.B. Yeats (New York: Macmillan Co., 1951), p. 234. 34See "Depths and Surfaces," pp. 261-66. I am arguing here not only against Friedman's interpretation but also in opposition to my own earlier reading of the novel in Art and Order: A Study of E.M. Forster (New York: New York Univ. Press, 1964). See especially, pp. 155-58. MODERNISM 137</page><page sequence="26">absolutes, and closural allusions.35 In this sense, there is no question of a direction left uncertain. Once again, the movement is reflexive. Friedman's comparison of the endings of A Passage to India and Women in Love serves, as I see it, only to emphasize the difference. Next to Lawrence's genuinely open-ended novel, Forster's suggests a backing away from what I agree is its potential for openness, its dimension of desire. What we have, in place of the untamed energies of Lawrence's characters, is the withdrawal of the artist from chaotic experience and, less explicitly but no less certainly than in The Waves, into the containment of his art. This image of aesthetic fusion naturally associates itself with the aesthetic theories of Stephen Dedalus. "The personality of the artist," he announces in the passage on the progression of artistic forms, ". . . finally refines itself out of existence, impersonalises itself, so to speak."36 But there is, as criticism abundantly shows, no easy way to establish how we are to react to Stephen or, indeed, to the Portrait as a whole. Whether Joyce's protagonist is, as the book ends, creator or forger, artist or aesthete, is only the final question about a novel that commentators have worried with as much imagination as persistence. "Well," Wayne Booth asks, "which Portrait do we choose, that of the artistic soul battling through successfully to his necessary freedom, or that of the child of God, choosing, like Lucifer, his own damnation?" and he ends by asserting that "we cannot believe that it is both a portrait of the prisoner freed and a portrait of the soul placing itself in chains."37 Friedman, quoting this passage, sees in it the rhetoric of a criticism that demands clarity, the evidence of the author's intention, at all costs; and, as we would expect, the novel is for him one more example of literary openness. But Booth has a point, though his penchant for "stable ironies" leads him to miss its implications. "The truth seems to be," he says, "that Joyce was always a bit uncertain about his attitude toward Stephen" (p. 330), and he goes on, discussing now the earlier version of the book, to say this: "A supreme egoist struggling to deal artistically with his own ego ... [Joyce] faced, in the completed Stephen Hero, what he had to recognize as a hodge-podge of irreconcilables." His solution, in moving to Portrait was, according to Booth, "a retreat": "simply 35Poetic Closure: A Study of How Poems End (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1970).

But can't we, less hot for univocal meaning, read Joyce's uncertainty differently and see Portrait as yet one more thematically open but formally contained work of absolute irony? Isn't the locus of the irony precisely the aesthetic and aestheticizing consciousness unable to solve or resolve the dilemma it posits, except by hovering over it in the sublimity of form? Like The Waste Land, "Monday or Tuesday," A Passage to India, and "Blood and the Moon," A Portrait of the Artist arrests its complexities and contradictions in one of modernism's variations on the basic, artistically perfected shape of paradox, inviting not the puzzle solver's ingenuity but the willingness to recognize, as at least a possible mode of response, the intractability of genuine crisis. I don't want to prolong indefinitely my catalogue of absolute ironists, though one could add such names as Gide, Kafka, and Faulkner, taking in along the way (minus its final chapter) that sacred cow of modernism, Ulysses, and ending with Molloy's "mania for symmetry" and Moran's final words: "Then I went back into the house and wrote, It is midnight. The rain is beating on the windows. It was not midnight. It was not raining. "38 What matters, in any case, is surely not the number of works that conform to the specifications of absolute irony but their individual and representative importance, since, as I've been attempting to indicate throughout this essay, absolute irony defines the crucial point, the furthest perceptual thrust of the modernist movement. Heirs to a tradition they revolted against-the whole tradition, some would maintain, of Western, Aristotelian logic-the modernists proved incapable either of accepting chaos or of denying it, and equally incapable of reformulating what seemed to them the inherent, inescapable shape of order-harmony, in a word, or organicism, or "significant form." So, first reducing confusion to superficially more manageable antinomies and dilemmas, they then framed their visions of disjunctiveness in the more than usually patterned order of art. Thus fixed and steadied, the paradox, the aesthetic embodiment of absolute irony, constitutes the emblem both of the ironist's intuition of disorder and of his compelling desire for at least the appearance of form: Moran's desperate confusion contained in Molloy's empty, isomorphic gestures. In short, a world threatening incoherence is first stabilized and 38Samuel Beckett, Molloy, in Three Novels by Samuel Beckett (New York: Grove Press, 1965), pp. 85 and 176. MODERNISM 139</page><page sequence="28">then distanced. But instability attends. Closed in a sense (not Brooks's sense), works of absolute irony are in a way open too, but it is not Friedman's way. Is it any wonder that works like those I have been describing seem so often on the point of exploding from within? One can speak, of course, of the marvellously controlled tension of modernist works, but at times the control is too obvious and the tension too great. Woolf's delicate web of questions in To the Lighthouse will not be encompassed by the great symbolic resolution- or only forcibly so; Stephen and Bloom, at least from the seventh chapter of Ulysses onward, are coerced by the novel's self-conscious proliferation of techniques. The openness of absolute irony is a space within the work of art, the gap between desire and its realization; for crisis, if it is genuine, must lead either to breakdown or to the reformulation of the problem (as Forster reformulated his in The Life to Come or Woolf hers in The Years and Between the Acts), and thus to a new form of desire. Institutions, it has been said, rigidify just before their collapse (or reformation), and so too movements. The dissatis- faction and frustration that are everywhere apparent in modernism progressively channel themselves into more and more rigid structures, which simultaneously externalize and turn inward the pressures that threaten to shatter them. For a moment-it is the definition of crisis- the flow of an unresolved energy is dammed up, arrested, before it breaks forth and floods the postmodern world, leaving in its wake a series of remarkable testimonies to the struggles of an age's conscious- ness, which, despite themselves no doubt, predict a new, more haphazard conception of order and an end to the aesthetics of crisis. IV I want to close by dipping gingerly into that flood, thereby reestablishing the postmodern perspective I alluded to earlier. But first it will be useful to take a brief look at the downward slope that leads to it. No movement terminates abruptly, least of all modernism, and crisis, in any case, is not termination, in literary periods any more than in drama. So it is hardly surprising that modernism continues on-not only in isolated pockets, as it does today-but, at least until the Second World War, as a definable movement, most notably in England in the 1930s among the members of the so-called Auden Group. The fact is that the major preoccupations of the earlier decade are still visible in the late modernism of its successor, and the writers of the thirties reveal themselves to be, if anything, still more self- 40 I CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="29">conscious, yet more aware of the rift between self and world than their elders. But differences there are, and for my purposes it will be most illuminating to focus on one in particular. The thirties, a decade on an altogether smaller scale than its predecessor-though a noisier one perhaps-is, fully as much as the twenties, a time of paradoxes. Indeed, external events forced on the thirties writers a series of troubling contradictions, centering in particular on the rival claims of artistic vocation and political commitment, which they then proceeded to debate publicly in the endless manifestoes and declarations of those years. But whether arguing art and politics, exploring the contrary tugs of past and future (C. Day Lewis' "In Me Two Worlds"), investigating the mysterious inconsistencies of personality (Isherwood's Truly Weak Man), or tracking down the sources of perverse and destructive evasions (Auden's negative inversion of the will), in all these cases the writers disclose their faith that contradictions are susceptible of resolution. The genuine paradox of the twenties gives way to apparent paradox, metaphysics to social science. Consciousness, no less initially confused and divided against itself, marches behind the banners of Marx or Freud (or both), trampling down in the process all of the mythical monsters of the decade: the old gang and the wicked mothers, the politicians and the clergy, and not least the craven doubts and hesitations of the self. So Auden, in a poem called "Crisis," answers his opening question--"Where do They come from? Those whom we so much dread"39-by demonstrating not only that we are ourselves responsible for the horrible anxieties, fears, and neuroses that afflict us, but, in addition, that we have "Failed as their pupils," that in continuing, however obliquely and ruinously, to resist the "Terrible Presences" we create, we open ourselves to a better future. So, first awareness, and then action and choice: the proper exercise of the will. It is the age's formula and its promise of relief. The aesthetics of crisis yield, in the decade's most characteristic metaphor, to the image of travel and to the resolving vision of a "New Country." But this is to make things too simple. From the start, the decade's enthusiasm for change rings a bit hollow. Auden's Paid on Both Sides counsels love and migration: the difficult journey to a new life (New 39 The Collected Poetry of W. H. Auden (New York: Random House, 1945), p. 169. Parenthetical page references to Auden's poems, preceded by CP, will be to this edition. References to Paid on Both Sides will be to the Collected Longer Poems (London: Faber and Faber, 1968), cited as CLP. MODERNISM | 41</page><page sequence="30">Country again) undertaken in a spirit of active but not histrionic commitment. But from time to time, the Chorus belies the social hope, shifting its attention from the local feud that is the major subject of the charade to the unchangeable human condition: the sense of "Man divided always and restless always,"40 to quote from The Dog Beneath the Skin, in which the same call to choose another life is undermined by the same covert intuition of the hopelessness and uselessness of choice. In Paid on Both Sides, Anne Shaw expresses, while rejecting, the thought of "divided days / When we shall choose from ways, / All of them evil, one" (CLP, p. 30). And throughout Auden's (and Isherwood's) work in the thirties-from "1929," where "a sudden shower / Fell willing into grass," symboli- zing the unthinking natural world and "Making choice seem a necessary error" (CP, p. 63) to The Ascent of F6, where the Abbot recommends, mysteriously, given the general direction of the play, "the complete abnegation of the will" (TGP, p. 154)--there runs the belief that any choice, because conscious, implies division and is therefore evil. I'm suggesting, in other words, that, in addition to the apparent paradoxes the decade traffics in, there are genuine para- doxes as well, but that these, half buried and contravened by the bugle calls to action, work not to define a present crisis, as among the earlier modernists, but to intimate the inevitability of one in the future. Of course, the decade was in any case moving, thanks to the economic and political events of the time, to its own more public crisis, but I doubt that the Auden Generation would, in the long run, have made substantively different decisions or expressed substan- tively different attitudes had events been otherwise. In retrospect at least, modernism appears to have been sliding toward a state of exhaustion and impasse. Jogged from the heights their elders held, defensively and with a kind of aesthetic bravado, the writers of the thirties, and particularly the decade's ironists, found themselves more bewildered than heartened by their frequently superficial involve- ments: troubled by the detachment, that, as they recognized, still afflicted them but uneasy in their demand for participation in a world whispering, beneath the shrill slogans and hopeful therapies, of disaster beyond the reach of politics and psychology and of disorder not to be stabilized by the symmetries of art. The chief paradox of the 40W.H. Auden and Christopher Isherwood, Two Great Plays (New York: Random House-Modern Library, n.d.), p. 97. The other "great play" is The Ascent of F 6. Parenthetical page references, preceded by TGP, will be to this edition. 42 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="31">decade-the inevitable but unintended subversion of depth through a relentless attention to surface, undertaken in an attempt to change both self and world by rendering language transparent-this paradox marks the effective end of modernism and of the attitudes that made absolute irony possible.41 Symptomatically, perhaps, Auden and Isherwood turned to religion in the forties, seeking a final resolution of modernist paradox, intractable now to art as well as to politics. In the philosophic city of Auden's "Spring 1940" man's doubleness is recognized and, sub specie aeternitatis, accepted. New Country has been transvalued and left behind. Younger writers have turned elsewhere, in so many directions, in fact, that it sometimes seems impossible to identify the goal because of the superabundance of movement. What can be said with some assurance is that postmodernism seeks in any number of ways to refute-or simply rejects-the very bases of modernist beliefs. Distance, detachment, depth, essentialism, anthropomorphism, humanism, analogies, and the privileging of sight have all been anathematized, most famously perhaps by Robbe-Grillet in Pour un nouveau roman (though I don't mean to attribute all of these rejec- tions to him) and more recently by writers like Raymond Federman, Ronald Sukenick, and other participators in the "literary disrup- tions" described in Jerome Klinkowitz' recent book. Most important may be what Erich Kahler views, with considerable asperity, as "the disintegration of form in the arts."42 Given Kahler's examples, there is much to be said for his diatribe, but it is possible too to speak, with Venturi, of an expanding, more comprehensive form, aiming, as he says, to fulfill through contradiction and complexity "the obligation toward the difficult whole" (pp. 89-103). Symmetry, shapeliness, and binary oppositions (pace Levi-Strauss and the structuralists) are clearly at a discount; and if Derrida is right in asserting that, since all oppositions are implicitly hierarchical, one of the two terms is always more valued, then still more so is the notion of genuine paradox.43 We begin, then, with an antipathy to at least certain kinds of 41For a fuller discussion of these problems, see my essay, "Language and Surface: Isherwood and The Thirties," Contemporary Literature, 16, No. 4 (Autumn 1975), 478-91. 42The last two references are to Jerome Klinkowitz' Literary Disruptions: The Making of a Post-Contemporary American Fiction (Urbana, Ill.: Univ. of Illinois Press, 1975) and Erich Kahler's The Disintegration of Form in the Arts (New York: George Braziller, 1968). 43See Jacques Derrida, Positions (Paris: Minuit, 1972), p. 17. MODERNISM 1 43</page><page sequence="32">order. But that is only the beginning-or only the manifestation-of the change. Modernism reaches through order toward stability, and in Derrida's antimetaphysics the very idea of presence undergoes increasing deconstruction, revealing only and always an elusive absence. The high modernists, it should be said, had themselves begun to dismantle the infrastructures of their universe, making visible everywhere the shadow of the abyss, but what is at issue here is as much an attitude as a vision. In the movement from depth to surface, from an orderliness defined in terms of harmony or stasis to a more kinetic sense of order, from the high seriousness of the modernists (even at their most whimsical or witty) to contemporary ideals of play, there is a further and more basic shift. To speak meta- phorically first, paradise, once lost, is now abandoned: Dowell's desperate desire not to concede the passing of the "true sunshine; the true music" is transformed, more or less cheerfully, into an anti- essentialist je m'en foutisme. The modernist nostalgia over origins is replaced by a dismissal of them; the frustration of being unable to resolve a dilemma gives way to an acceptance of the impossibility of making any sense whatever of the world as a whole. Acceptance is the key word here. Modernist irony, absolute and equivocal, expresses a resolute consciousness of different and equal possibilities so ranged as to defy solution. Postmodern irony, by contrast, is suspensive: an in- decision about the meanings or relations of things is matched by a willingness to live with uncertainty, to tolerate and, in some cases, to welcome a world seen as random and multiple, even, at times, absurd. Forster's vision of simple contiguity has been naturalized, so to speak, transformed from a bleak intimation of unbearable meaninglessness into an acceptance of life as sometimes messy and vital, sometimes more prosaically quotidian, and, at worst, a manageably chaotic. The last phrase is possibly too self-contradictory to pass without comment. I mean simply that, at the least, postmodernism has managed to establish enclaves of occasionally odd and curious pleasures, "the smaller pleasures," Forster calls them in The Life to Come, while continuing to acknowledge, if only covertly, the confusion that attends and surrounds them. All of this is to say that the conditions which made possible the modernist imagination of crisis have now gone by the board. Yeats was righter than he knew. The center has indeed not held-and for a good reason: to all intents and purposes, it has disappeared, taking with it the fulcrum on which the modernist dilemma turned or, rather, supported itself. Paradox has become quandary, the scales have been 44 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="33">unbalanced, and we have come, depending upon how one chooses to read the present, either to what Spanos calls "this silent realm of dreadful uncertainty," where and only where we are "likely to discover the ontological and aesthetic possibilities of generosity" (pp. 167-68) or, according to Kahler, to "the triumph of incoherence" (pp. 73-109). Neither alternative is all that joyful, though Spanos at any rate sees hope in the break from the modernist tradition. I don't think it would be inaccurate to assert that, as the large, imposing structures that embody the modernist crisis become, from the thirties onward, increasingly modest and various, crisis itself, redefined as an almost continuous response to a decentered or uncentered world turns, quite simply, into anxiety, that uneasy burden of contingent existence. And for Spanos, anxiety is exactly what the postmodern artist ought to be aiming at, as a way "of undermining the detective-like expectations of the positivistic mind, of unhoming Western man" (p. 167). Bar- thelme's Thomas puts the case more lightly but with similar intent in The Dead Father: "Things are not simple. . . . Things are not done right. Right things are not done. There are cases which are not clear. You must be able to tolerate the anxiety. To do otherwise is to jump ship, ethics-wise" (p. 93). Tolerating the anxiety. It is a reasonable, if not complete, definition of the postmodern sensibility, in any case of its ironic wing. And there, for the moment, I want to leave that sensibility, at least as something to be contemplated for its own sake. It is time to focus backward again, using the present as a vantage point from which to survey the past more accurately. The question that remains (it is the one I posed at the outset and left hanging) is this: how are we to evaluate and respond to the practitioners of absolute irony, the modernist masters whose reputations are in many cases currently under siege? For the response, Barthelme's portrait of the Dead Father once more comes neatly to hand. As I suggested earlier, that colossal relic of the past is Barthelme's myth of modernism: imperious (his murderous temper); commanding (his "Authority. Fragile, yet present" [p. 67] and his fondness for issuing ukases); aesthetic (he is an art connoisseur manqu" and the novel's most spacious and rhetorical speaker); a devotee of organization and order ("What purpose? What entelechy?" [p. 168] is his question to two of his children); and, finally, someone who, as he admits, enjoys "having it both ways" (p. 15). Certainly, it is a comprehensive, if parodic, account of the modernist myth, critical but not without humorous sympathy; and it is wholly appropriate that Barthelme's postmodern version of The MODERNISM 45</page><page sequence="34">Waste Land discovers the possibility of redemption in the death of its Fisher King. But though Thomas oversees the burial with which the book closes, as the Dead Father descends still unwillingly into his grave, he disclaims responsibility: "Processes are killing you," he says, "not we. Inexorable processes" (p. 158). The remark echoes what may be the novel's central comment, which appears at the end of the interpolated book within the book, "A Manual for Sons." "Patricide," the anonymous author of the "Manual" writes, "is a bad idea. . . . It is not necessary to slay your father, time will slay hinr, that is a virtual certainty. Your true task lies elsewhere. Your true task, as a son, is to reproduce every one of the enormities touched upon in this manual, but in attenuated form. You must become your father, but a paler, weaker version of him. . . . Your contribution will not be a small one, but 'small' is one of the concepts you should shoot for. . . . Fatherhood can be, if not conquered, at least 'turned down' in this generation-by the combined efforts of all of us together" (p. 145). The strategy is typically Barthelmean: the small-scale effort to disenchant or demystify inherited beliefs and imperatives informs all of his work.44 And typical too is the novel's climactic revelation. In its final chapter, where, unequivocally now, the rains do fall, the Dead Father learns that the Golden Fleece he has all along been seeking (for him the journey is a quest to recover his youth) does not exist-or not in the shape or place he had imagined: No Fleece? asked the Dead Father. Thomas looked at Julie. She has it? Julie lifted her skirt. Quite golden, said the Dead Father. Quite ample. That's it? All there is, Julie said. Unfortunately. But this much. This where life lives. (pp. 174-75) Together with the antipatricidal message of the "Manual for Sons," this interchange makes Barthelme's related points: the value of a not too vigorous stand against the largeness of absolute values; the effort to participate in an admittedly confused world; and the acceptance of life, however drab, as the only source of the smaller pleasures. So then, the largely ritual nature of the journey that loosely structures 44See my essay, "Barthelme Unfair to Kierkegaard: Some Thoughts on Modern and Postmodern Irony," Boundary 2, 5, No. 1 (Fall 1976), 45-70. 46 I CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="35">the book suggests a debunking of the insistent modernist quest, in The Waste Land and elsewhere. What you find, the novel implies, is what you already have under your nose-or, in this case, under Julie's skirt. As a low-keyed restatement of the anxiety of influence, The Dead Father contrasts a modest present with a too solid past, all moral bluster and aesthetic retreat, and proceeds, in a final parody of Eliot, to its own "burial of the dead." Allowing for rather too much and too derivative artfulness of its own, a sometimes numbing indulgence in nonreferential play, the novel succeeds wonderfully well in dramatizing its refusal of the sustained, the coherent, and the organic and, equally, its affirmation of the provisional and suspen- sive-in asserting, in short, the validity of local, uncoordinated pleasures against the claims of entelechy. But does the portrait of the Dead Father stand up to the facts of modernism? If I'm right in what I've been saying all along, then the answer is no, although Barthelme's summons to smallness provides a helpful clue to the truth. What is required, I think, is less a "turning down" in the present of modernism's overwhelming fatherhood, as the novel conceives it, than a recognition that the modernists were themselves somewhat less monumental than they are now taken to be. Earlier, rejecting Brooks's criterion of maturity, I described the modernists as heroic, but that word may be as inadequate as the other for the scale and condition I'm trying to suggest. Isherwood's phrase, "the antiheroic hero"45 (used to describe Forster), comes closer to the mark perhaps, but even qualified, the idea of heroism is not likely to sit well with an age like the present, so resolutely seeking, exceptions like Pynchon notwithstanding, to miniaturize both its aspirations and its forms. No, not even the antiheroic hero: it is too easy to conjure up an endlessly receding line of statues, their heads drooping disconsolately but each upper lip still defiantly stiff. What word will do then? To find it we need to recognize in the unresolved quality of modernist irony (to return to the essential mode of its art) a refusal of easy answers and, at the same time, to acknowledge in its absolute poise not confidence and rest but crisis and arrest-to concede, that is, the humanity of the modernist enterprise. At the heart of that enterprise one discerns the intense need to shape a disordered world-not, in the first instance, either to reform or escape it but, instead, to establish, if only negatively, a relationship with it. The search for relationship is what links the 45Down There on a Visit (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1962), p. 162. MODERNISM 47</page><page sequence="36">modernist attempt with the postmodern effort now in process; and if the latter has, by reformulating the problem, brought the speci- fically modernist crisis to an end and opened the door to new solu- tions, it has sometimes succeeded only too well in packaging them in severely attenuated containers. I'm not sure that anyone can declare today what the mainstream of postmodernism is, but it is at least possible to discern, here and there within the movement, the danger on the one hand of a too flaccid acceptance of disorder and, on the other, of a too easy retreat into a reductive, minimalist aestheticism that makes Clive Bell's pronouncements seem hardy by comparison. For what characterizes the modernist consciousness above all is the energy of its desire. And where postmodernism succeeds, it does so by embodying that energy, though to be sure, on a less heroic scale. In these cases, the sons have become the fathers, as Barthelme says, their achievement, as he also implies, not only a weakening of the originals but a redirection of their energy, so that the sons manage, in the unobtrusively symbolic phrase of Between the Acts, to "touch earth,"46 as the modernist ironists, for all their perfervid primitivism, ultimately failed to do. Between the Acts, odd though it may sound to say so, seems to me still the most impressive of postmodern novels, and all the more interesting for representing an awareness of and a response to the crisis I've described, not by a later generation but by one of the major modernists reacting to the dead-end her own earlier work reveals. For the awareness and the response seem to me unquestionably deliberate. Far more fluid and open in its form than novels like To the Lighthouse and The Waves, Woolf's final work contrives nonetheless to allude to the paradoxes of absolute irony. Throughout the book, we are presented with an insistent structure of opposites, which culminates in the contrasting "Unity-Dispersity" (p. 235) the pageant ends with. (The reference at one point to "the donkey who couldn't choose between hay and turnips and so starved" [p. 74] neatly summarizes the inevitable consequences of absolute irony's arrested poise.) But the oppositions, the novel makes clear, are thematic-merely conceptualizations of life's ineradicable ambigui- ties; and to that degree, equally true or equally false or-and this is the most accurate way of viewing them-equally irrelevant: " 'Yes,' Isa answered, 'No,' she added. It was Yes, No. Yes, yes, yes, the tide rushed out embracing. No, no, no, it contracted" (p. 251). What we 46Between the Acts (London: Hogarth Press, 1953), p. 32 48 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="37">have here is not modernism's balanced "either-or" but, as contem- porary critics are fond of saying, postmodernism's more comprehen- sive "both-and." In any case, it is not on the level of theme but of texture that the novel's final vision asserts itself: in its enormous density, its heterogeneous materials, its constant reference to the absolute dailyness-the "Monday or Tuesday"-of the life it presents. Within the context of its omnipresent noise-and its silences ("We are always in a plenum, in being," Merleau-Ponty writes, ". . . just as silence is still a modality of the world of sound" [PhP, p. 352])- things seem to exist, as they do not in the earlier novels, in their own right; not simply as avenues to transcendent vision but, like the animals passing in and out of the barn or the fish swimming "in their self-centered world" (p. 55), as themselves. For Between the Acts maintains and expresses a contact with things as they are: the world as perceived. The reference to touching earth derives from an allusion to Antaeus, and Antaeus is precisely the right emblem for Woolf's novel and for the postmodern imagination as well. Thus, later in the book, starlings attack the tree behind which Miss La Trobe, the exhausted author of the pageant, has been concealed, and she witnesses "a quivering cacophony . . . birds syllabling discor- dantly life, life, life, without measure" (p. 245). There is nothing placid about the scene, as the world (the starlings) imposes itself on Miss La Trobe's being (her consciousness incarnated in the tree), but that is the point. The unsought activation of perception begins again the process of vision, and "from the earth green waters seemed to rise over her"; "words of one syllable sank down into the mud. She drowsed; she nodded. The mud became fertile" (pp. 246, 247-48; my italics). What we witness is the affirmation of the Lebenswelt, or, rather, we are given an image of vision arising out of and rooted to it: and acceptance of the gaps and discontinuities that were once, for Woolf and other modernists, the source of horror and now, between the acts, become the basis of life and creation. If Woolf's affirmation defines the nature of postmodern irony, it also releases the energy of desire contained in the earlier novels and in "Monday or Tuesday." And so too, it seems to me, postmod- ernism in general-or at its best-fulfills the blocked energies inscribed in the modernist crisis. Thus Ferguson, the narrator of Max Apple's "Vegetable Love," failing in his modernist attempt to discover depth (his center) and his late modernist effort to become transparent (the name he assumes is Glass), realizes that "starting MODERNISM 49</page><page sequence="38">from himself and stretching right to the farthest astronaut hitting a golf ball on the moon, there was a line of chaos as direct as the plumb line that went through Ferguson." "Who had absolutes?" he asks himself, and answers, simply, as he prepares for a new life, "I have tried."47 The tone resembles nothing we associate with modernism, and no more do Ferguson's final attitudes: the rejection of certainty and the acceptance of chaos--the attainment, in other words, of suspensiveness. But the roots of his quest point backward as surely as his solution points ahead. The breaking up of paradox, then, can be, interpreted not as the discrediting of modernism but as the release of its humanity; and, retrospectively, we can now see, in distance and detachment, in the search for order and its creation through absolute irony, not moral smugness and aesthetic complacency but, to say it one last time, the dynamics of consciousness in crisis. By humanity I intend, I should say, not whatever may result from the personal revelations about Woolf and Strachey, Forster and Eliot, and the rest, which, in exposing clay feet that leave prints no different from our own, threaten, in some instances at least, to simplify the problematics of their work. The evidence I'm referring to, the case against the dehumanizing and dismissal of modernism, exists in the texts themselves. Biography will shed its light no doubt, but all the rest-and it is what counts, after all: the still vital legacy of modernism to its rebellious sons and daughters, inevitably attempt- ing once again to make it new-all the rest is literature.
