<plain_text><page sequence="1">SHRINES AND THE DOMESTICATION OF LANDSCAPE' Charles Mather Department of Anthropology, University of Calgary, 2500 University Drive N.W., Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2N IN4 Landscapes reflect predominant patterns of social action and thought. In this article, the relationship between landscapes and shrines in Kusasi territory in northern Ghana is explicated in terms of the domestication of the natural world. Focusing on a particular settlement, I argue that Kusasi shrines embody local and tribal histories. Field observations and interviews reveal that the Kusasi use shrines to demarcate physical territories according to social divisions. Through shrines and their associated rites, the Kusasi transform the physical world into a ceremonial landscape. The transformation of the physical world is part of a ritual process involving the domestication of natural and spiritual forces. Shrines are sites of mediation where the Kusasi reiterate established meanings and generate new ones. THE GOAL OF THIS ARTICLE is to illustrate the role that shrines play in defining local landscapes in northern Ghana, West Africa. Amongst the Gur-speaking populations that occupy this part of the African continent, shrines are part of a ritual process that incorporates the natural world into the social world. Using rites and ceremonies at shrines, people establish intimate social connections with the essential forces of nature and thereby define the physical world in social terms. To illustrate the process of domestication, the erection and history of earth shrines among the Kusasi of the Upper East Region will be examined. The Kusasi are patrilineal, with members of lineal segments tracing descent to an apical male ancestor. Lineal segments commemorate their ancestors by keeping shrines and providing them with animal sacrifices and libations of beer. Rites at a shrine are a means of "serving" the associated spirits; one serves one's ancestors and the spirits of the land. The Kusasi use shrines to demarcate territory and to make explicit claims of belonging to and on the land and of being the descendants of those who founded the living community or settlement. Through shrines and their associated knowledge and practice, the Kusasi divide the natural world in reflection of social relationships, and by domesticating the natural world, they create landscape. Shrines are sites of mediation where the ambiguity and unpredictability of relations are harnessed to generate meaning.

An excellent example is the analysis of historical texts by Luig and Von Oppen (1997), which traces the meaning of landscape in European history. In medieval Europe, landscape was "a set of social norms (customary law) recognized in a particular settlement" (Luig and Von Oppen 1997:9). A social construct, landscape was a code of conduct for social relationships rather than the natural or physical topography. Near the end of the medieval era, the term meant an area covered by a set of social norms-a bounded space or territory in which a particular set of norms predominated. Urbanization and other economic and political developments in the Middle Ages helped redefine landscape as the countryside, the natural areas surrounding urban centers. The spatial opposition between countryside and urban center correlated with sociopolitical oppositions. The city was the seat of government; it controlled the economy and acted as the ruling power of the countryside and its peasant inhabitants. Urbanization gave rise to landscape art-a realist genre that gained popularity among the literate classes. Popular works depicted the natural environment at a distance, from a vantage point that afforded the widest view possible of the countryside. According to Thomas (1993:22), landscape art was a child of capitalism, the reflection of an incessant drive to commodify and control resources, goods, land, people, and labor. The ideal of market control was reflected in the omniscient view afforded to viewers of landscape art, "a representation of place which alienates land, such that it can be appropriated by a gaze which looks in from outside" (Thomas 1993:23). In a related vein, Olwig (1993:327-34) refers to landscape art as a colonization of nature, and Green (1996) writes about the vision of landscape in terms of class formation. The above arguments are partly inspired by Foucault's (1977) elucidation of power, domination, and control in the contexts of Jeremy Bentham's ideal prison, the panopticon. Anthropologists are using Foucault's theory of the totalitarian gaze, an explication of behavioral and spatial monitoring as a form of institutional control in the late capitalist world, to explain landscape for cultures from different pasts and places. The idea of totalitarian gaze works well for explaining the spatial division and layout of institutions in postmodern late capitalist societies. However, the idea might have little utility to anthropologists who wish to engage in landscape as it is lived by people in other societies that have different histories and political trajectories. As Gow (1996:60) notes in a study of landscape in Santa Clara, western Amazonia, Foucault's work, however enlightening about the interior construction of Western modes of knowledge, provides ethnographers with no guide to reflection on the modes of experience with which they seek to engage. The relationship between the people of Santa Clara and their land cannot be decanted from a critical reflection on Western philosophy, for it must be sought out in active</page><page sequence="3">SHRINES AND THE DOMESTICATION OF LANDSCAPE 25 engagement with these people, with all the problems that involves. Landscape is, following Hirsch (1996:22-23), a process, and the goal of the anthropologist is to become engaged with the process. In a comparable sense, Luig and Von Oppen (1997:16) define landscape as a "historical process rather than a finished result, as the dynamics of material, cognitive and political construction of a society's environment." The notion that landscape is a dynamic process is present in the "dwelling approach." Dwelling, according to Thomas (1993:28), "involves a lack of distance between people and things, a lack of casual curiosity, an engagement which is neither conceptualized nor articulated, and which arises through using world rather than through scrutiny. Our immediate world is characterized by its inconspicuous familiarity-not by its to-be-looked-at-ness." Landscape is not an object. It must be understood from the inside, from the perspective of an actor rather than the perspective of a viewer. Like Gow, Thomas (1993:28) advocates engagement as a method of coming to understand peoples' perspectives of the landscape- understanding by being a subject and living within landscape rather than looking at it as a measurable commodity.2 Ingold (1993:152) adopts a dwelling approach and argues that "landscape is constituted as an enduring record of-and testimony to-the lives and works of past generations who have dwelt within it, and in so doing have left there something of themselves." The landscape envelops events, people, and places from the past, which are reiterated and remembered in the movements, actions, and relations of those who presently dwell within the landscape. Learning to move in the landscape involves learning about the past and the people who preceded us there in time and space. The landscape is a story. The telling and reading of the story "is not like weaving a tapestry to cover up the world, it is rather a way of guiding the attention of listeners or readers into it (Ingold 1993:153)."3 The narrative of landscape is framed by locales. Put another way, locales are the constituent parts of landscape. As Tilley (1996:161) explains in a study of topography and monuments from the Neolithic and Bronze Age of southwest England, a landscape is a set of relationships between named locales, while locales are physical settings for social interaction. Actors draw upon the material and symbolic cues present at locales to improvise and negotiate meaning and behaviors. Locales shape personal identities; they "have individual and particular embedded meanings and are of vital significance in the formation of the existential self' (Tilley 1996:161). Local identities and histories are embodied at locales while the landscape, constituted of several locales, transcends the meanings of locales and inculcates history and identity at a larger scale. Landscapes partly consist of locales that are ritually and spiritually important, and in this sense we can speak of sacred or ceremonial geography. In a study of Mapuche monuments and ritual locales in south-central Chile, Dillehay (1990:226) describes ceremonial landscape as a historical construct, comprised of artificial and natural features, such as sacred streams and hills, and spaces that are associated with significant events, people, and places from the past. Monuments,</page><page sequence="4">26 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH spaces, and features "contribute to local history in a specific and temporal context through the perpetual and intergenerational creation and utility of particular geographical and ceremonial locations" (Dillehay 1990:226). Ritual locales tie history and social order to spirituality. In the Mapuche case, the association between history, land, and spirituality facilitates social recruitment and the determination of resource rights. Thus the ceremonial landscape has consequence to political, economic, and social relations. In her work among the plateau Tonga from Zimbabwe, Colson (1997) describes two different sorts of ritual locale: "places of power" and "shrines of the land." "Places of power" are permanent features of the landscape regarded as inherently sacred or the loci of spiritual power. If they are associated with particular named spirits rather than generic spirits or unpersonified force, these spirits are usually mythologized as ancient heroes who existed before present political units or communities came into existence or they are conceived as spiritual forces of non-human origin. (Colson 1997:52) In contrast to "places of power," "shrines of the land" are built by humans and the spirits commonly associated with them are the spirits of those reputed to have first settled the locality or to have subsequently conquered and ruled it. They require offerings from those who now occupy their places, and adherence to routines established by themselves. (Colson 1997:52) "Shrines of the land" encode local histories, human actors, and events, while "places of power" express histories transcending human actors and local communities. Perspectives toward landscape can be based upon history, but they can also be founded in cosmology and creation and in how acts of creation infuse and manifest in the land. Morphy (1993:232) summarizes native accounts from northeast Arnhem Land, describing how in Dream Time ancestral beings fashioned the landscape through both unintentional and intentional actions which infused the land with spiritual forces. Ceremony and ritual release these forces in a process of spirit conception, "part of the way in which continuity is established between ancestral beings, social groups and land. Thus features of the landscape are signs of both people and of the embodiment of spiritual forces." Elsewhere, Morphy (1996:188) expands on this point, explaining that "ancestral beings, fixed in the land, become a timeless reference point outside the politics of daily life to which the emotions of the living can be attached." The ceremonial landscape of northeast Arnhem Land is timeless, enmeshed in a continual state of becoming, where ancestral beings and living people are intertwined, and the past, present, and future collapse into one another. Dwelling in the landscape is not only a question of "being here now"; it is also, necessarily, a way of "being there then."</page><page sequence="5">SHRINES AND THE DOMESTICATION OF LANDSCAPE 27 Ritual locales are timeless places, comprised of physical objects and features; they denote a spatial and temporal order, as well as a cognitive order. Citing Criado (1989), Tilley (1993:80) examines the notions that megalithic monuments are events or happenings of thought and that human thought may be characterized as being "savage" or "domesticated." In the former mode of thought, nature and culture are complementary and codependent, whereas in the latter, nature and culture are in opposition. The construction of megalithic monuments is an attempt, by domesticated thought, to impose order on and control nature. Tilley (1993) rejects this position as overdrawn and argues that ritual locales are means of domesticating spirits of ancestors and land: "The important thing is that building megaliths establishes a particular form of ordering and domesticating in the landscape bound up with stressing ancestral presences through architectural orders" (Tilley 1993:80). Megaliths signify claims to land predicated on descent from founding ancestors-that the land is and has been inhabited, ritually defined, and hence domesticated. The notion that ceremonial landscapes are part of a strategy to domesticate the natural world is apparent in Central Africa, where several researchers have studied the socioreligious institutions that govern use of ritual locales (Werbner 1977; Schoffeleers 1977, 1978b; Colson 1977; Garbett 1977; van Binsbergen 1977, 1978). These institutions, alternately referred to as territorial cults and regional cults, are characterized by a concern with environment and ecological management. As described by Schoffeleers 1978a:2), the characteristic activities of territorial cults are rituals to counteract droughts, floods, blights, pests and epidemic diseases afflicting cattle and man. Put positively, territorial cults function in respect of the well-being of the community, its fields, livestock, fishing, hunting and general economic interests. Apart from engaging in ritual action, however, they also issue and enforce directives with regard to a community's use of its environment. Finally, they provide schemas of thought in which myths, rituals and directives for action appear as parts of a coherent world view. The ritual locales controlled by territorial cults are often set apart from human settlements, and the land around them is reserved for ceremonies and offerings to the spirit of the land. Suspension of day-to-day activities such as farming and animal grazing makes ritual locales ideal habitat for wild plants and animals, and thus they are similar to nature reserves. The philosophy of ecological management practiced by territorial cults is founded on beliefs about essential differences between humans and nature. Morris (1995:302) argues that for Malawians, the crucial spatial distinction is between the village and the woodland. The village is the epitome of settled space, the domain of living humans, while the woodland is unsettled space, the domain of wild animals and spirits of the dead and the source of life-generating powers. The division of village and woodland cannot be reduced to a series of structural oppositions between homologous pairs such as nature:culture, men:women,</page><page sequence="6">28 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH affines:kin, ancestors:the living, and animals:people. Rather, the village and woodland are in contrast because "whereas in the village environs a fundamental- but complementary-opposition is articulated between men and women, kin and affines, humans and wild animals-in the woodland there is a fundamental identity between these categories" (Morris 1995:308). Near their communities, Malawians reserve particular areas of woodland, called manda, for burial grounds where ancestors (amanda) dwell (Morris 1995:308-9). The manda woodlands are ritual sites used for initiation rites, making offerings to the ancestors, and holding funerals. Ancestors are both affines and kin, men and women; thus village oppositions are dissolved in the manda woodlands. Discrete cultural categories in the village environs become comparable and equivalent in the woodland because conceptual boundaries are blurred together. The woodland levels hierarchy and dissolves distinction. It is a chaotic space wherein discrete cultural categories are mixed and blended. This blending is a source of spiritual power with unlimited potential. Regardless of the conventions and norms prevalent in the village, all cultural categories are possible in the woodlands. More will be said about this below. Territorial cults can be politically influential; they can be used by groups and individuals to garner political support from the general populace, sometimes serving as the foundation for armed revolution. Guerilla forces in Zimbabwe during the 1970s, for example, found grassroots support by seeking guidance and blessing from the spirit mediums associated with the shrines at the center of cult activities (Lan 1985). More typically, political authorities attempt to entangle their reign and rule with the cult apparatus, naturalizing their authority through ritual association with enshrined spiritual forces. Examples include the historic kingdom of Asantemanso, in what is now the Ashanti region of Ghana, that was centered upon a large sacred grove wherein were enshrined the ancestors of the royal line (Shinnie and Vivian 1991); the kingdom of Bafut, in the Western Grassfields of Cameroon, where the king was also the chief priest of the cults (Asombang 1999); and the various polities in the Bunyoro-Kitara area of Uganda during the early part of the last millennium (Robertshaw 1999). The fact that ritual locales can serve the interests of political resistance or political authority underscores their ambiguous and unpredictable nature. On one hand, they reinforce the normative structures of society, passively reflecting social categories and collectives. On the other hand, the locales can be put to practical use, for performing actions and proposing alternative categorizations that contradict, refute, and challenge the norm. The power to sustain or modify normative categories rests in the supernatural power invested in the ritual locale. The process is ambiguous and unpredictable because the source of power is ultimately unobservable and therefore beyond direct manipulation, being known only through its surficial effects. In an ethnographic study of a Mende settlement in Sierra Leone, Ferme (2001) argues that the visible world is activated by hidden forces and meanings concealed underneath the discourse, objects, and relations that characterize daily life. Ritual locales are, in Ferme's terms, "sites of mediation" where oppositional and complementary elements (e.g., village:bush,</page><page sequence="7">SHRINES AND THE DOMESTICATION OF LANDSCAPE 29 friend:stranger, male:female, humans:"spirits," visible:invisible, cause:effect) are alternatively set apart and placed together. Ritual locales are center points in the production of meaning, where invisible forces are made manifest in the visible world. This article discusses Kusasi ceremonial landscape by concentrating upon earth shrines that the Kusasi refer to as land gods. Kusasi land gods are ritual locales involved with the creation of social order and history, conceptions of time and space, relations between settled space and natural environment, and cosmology. Land gods are also drawn into political discourse and symbolize particular sociopolitical entities. Through the founding of land gods, the Kusasi attempt to domesticate land and spirit, to bring external forces and power into the domain of the house or society. The land gods are sites of mediation-the grounds on which the normative meets the practical, invisible force manifests in visible phenomena, and new meanings are generated and negotiated. ETHNOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND Anthropological research on the Kusasi began over sixty years ago as part of a concerted effort by the British colonial administration to orient and augment developmental schemes in what the administration referred to as the Northern Territories of the Gold Coast. The first major ethnographic study was Rattray's Tribes of the Ashanti Hinterland (1932), a general survey describing customs, social organization, material culture, and language. As part of their administrative duties, district officers were required to compile local histories. J.K.G. Syme (1932), the district officer stationed in Bawku in the late 1920s and early 1930s, produced a report on Kusasi history at the same time that Rattray's work was published. In the same decade, an agricultural officer named Lynn (1937) studied Kusasi agriculture and the impact, success, and future of colonial policy concerning land use and management. Since the 1930s, the Kusasi have repeatedly appeared as subjects in developmentally oriented research studies that are primarily concerned with agriculture and environment (Wiszniewski 1955; Chilalah 1957; Cleveland 1980, 1986, 1989, 1991; Devereux 1989, 1993; Whitehead 1988; Blench 1998; Webber 1996a, 1996b; Warner 1995). Spratt and Spratt (1968, 1972) documented the phonology and syntax for the Kusasi language, called Kusal. Bourdier and Min-Ha (1985) take a chapter to describe and analyze a "typical" Kusasi compound, in a comparative study of vernacular architecture from northern Ghana and Burkina Faso. An elaboration of Syme's work on Kusasi history is given in a set of notes published by Hilton (1962). Finally, Awedoba (1989a, 1989b, 1990) discusses Kusasi marital exchange and prestations. This article presents observations made in the settlement of Zorse, located in Bawku East District, Upper East Region (Figure 1). The Upper East Region (UER) of Ghana covers an area of 8,842 km2 and is located between parkland forest and Sahel at about 10030' to 110 north latitude and between 00 and 10 west of the prime meridian. Kusasi territory falls roughly within Bawku East and Bawku West, two</page><page sequence="8">30 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH of the six districts that comprise the UER, with respective district administrative capitals of Bawku and Zebilla. The territory covers about 3,000 km2 and is bordered by the Red Volta River, the Togo-Ghana border, the Burkina Faso- Ghana border, and the Gambaga escarpment. The climate is arid and semitropical with a wet season between May and October and a dry season, characterized by Harmattan winds, lasting from November to April.

The Study Area in Northern Ghana</page><page sequence="9">SHRINES AND THE DOMESTICATION OF LANDSCAPE 31 According to 1989 estimates, the population of Bawku East and West is 361,561 with 146 persons per square kilometer in Bawku East and 68 persons per square kilometer in Bawku West (Webber 1996a). Given an annual growth rate of 3 percent, the population of Bawku districts in 1997 would have been 458,014. The bulk of the Kusasi live in rural settlements and practice a form of rain-fed, fixed cultivation focusing on cereals (Cleveland 1980; Webber 1996a; Lynn 1937; Blench 1998). They speak Kusal, a language of the Gur family belonging to the Niger-Congo phylum (Naden 1988). Social organization is strongly patrilineal, polygyny is common, and postmarital residence is patrilocal. The basic unit of Kusasi settlement is the earthen walled compound (yir), occupied by a residential group (yirdiim) headed by a senior male (yirana). Divisions within residential groups occur as a result of blood ties between descendants of the same mother. The compound is physically divided into courtyards (zak), each occupied by a residential subgroup (zakdiim) consisting of a wife and her children. The house is a central principle of Kusasi social organization. Lineages are referred to with the same term (dabog) used for a compound whose founder is deceased. A lineage is a "house," and the lineal segments that make up the house are "rooms." Belonging to a house or room denotes membership in the larger social order. In contrast to the house, the Kusasi recognize the "wild"-an external realm beyond the social order. The "wild" is the antithesis to the "house" and is associated with other external forces or threats, including strangers and members of other patrilineages. Local social and political authority resides in the offices of secular chiefs, who hold juridical control over subsettlements, settlements, tribal subterritories, and territories, and in the offices of earth priests (tengindana), individuals who hold ritual authority over the land and human relations with the land. Offices of ritual authority are based on control over land gods (tengbana, "skin of the earth"). Land gods consist of large stones (about 30 x 20 x 20 cm) set into the ground at prominent natural features, such as hills, forests, streams, and ponds, and at the site of founders' compounds. The stones used to make the shrines are not imposing structures, but the natural features associated with the stones are imposing and make the land gods readily observable at a distance. DATA COLLECTION The goal of fieldwork was to identify Kusasi land gods, plot their locations in physical space on topographic maps, record their associated histories, conduct interviews about and participate in the rituals held at land gods, and gather information about the offices and officers that oversee land gods. Observations come from nine months of ethnoarchaeological research conducted from July 1996 to April 1997 among the Agole Kusasi in Bawku East District (Mather 1999, 2000). Research efforts were focused on the rural settlements of Zorse and Yarigungu. The former community served as a case study of settlement and subsettlement land gods, while the latter was the site of a study of land gods with influence over a larger spatial area and a much larger group of people (the entire population within Agole territory).</page><page sequence="10">32 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH To identify land gods within the settlement of Zorse, an interpreter (Cletus Anobiga) was hired, and interviews were conducted with community elders (elderly males, n = 12) and officeholders (tengindana, "settlement chief," "subchiefs," n = 9). After compiling a list of the land gods within the settlement and the names of the respective subsettlement in which they are found, I visited the land gods to take photos and plot their locations on topographic maps using a handheld GPS unit. Once the land gods within the settlement were identified and documented, interviews were conducted with officeholders to elicit the histories of the shrines, including when and by whom they were founded and other important historical events. Interviews were also conducted with officeholders about the ceremonial knowledge and practice associated with shrines, how they obtained the knowledge and practice, and the patterns of inheritance of ritual offices. Alongside interviews about ceremonial knowledge and practice, rites held at the land gods were observed. These included the ceremonies held at the nara festival to commemorate the harvest of the early millet and at saman piid, the celebration of the late harvest at the end of the rainy season. Other occasions involving invocation of the land gods were also recorded, including a rally for a political candidate in the 1996 national election. Research in Yarigungu focused on the paramount land gods in Agole territory. The shrines were photographed, and their locations were plotted on topographic maps using GPS. In addition, interviews with the chief and earth priest of Yarigungu (a single man occupies both offices) were conducted to gather the history of the shrines, find out the pattern of inheritance of the office associated with the shrines, and record the obligations and expectations of the officeholder responsible for the shrines. KUSASI LAND GODS: PLACES OF POWER AND SHRINES OF THE LAND The origins of Kusasi land gods are always intimately tied to the founding of human settlements. Land gods either represent the founders of a settlement or subsettlement or they represent the establishment of a covenant between the spirits of the land and the initial founders of a settlement. The latter sort of land god commemorates the inherent power of the land (a "place of power" following Colson), while the former type of land god commemorates the spirits of historical personae (a "shrine of the land" in Colson's terms). An excellent example of a land god as a "place of power" is the paramount land god of Agole territory. The land god, also called Agole, is the tallest hill in Bawku East District, located in the settlement of Yarigungu just northwest of the district capital of Bawku-town. Sacrifices to the land god Agole, performed by a man who holds the dual role of earth priest and chief in Yarigungu, are made at a large stone that is set into the ground at the foot of the western slope of Agole hill. The land god is an inherent and imposing feature of the landscape. It is the seat of spiritual power within Agole territory and it is of nonhuman origin. The term Agole refers not only to the land god but also to the subtribe, the</page><page sequence="11">SHRINES AND THE DOMESTICATION OF LANDSCAPE 33 territory occupied by the subtribe, and the dialect of Kusal spoken within the territory. Agole is a monumental symbol that simultaneously denotes a physical territory and a social group that expresses its claims to the territory in familial terms. The Agole have claim to Agole territory because they are the descendants of the initial settlers to establish reciprocal relations with the spirit of the land. Validation for the claims of the Agole subtribe is commonly sought in a fairly recent historical event involving a Mamprussi military raid on the Kusasi in the first third of the nineteenth century (Syme 1932; Hilton 1962). The Mamprussi king sent his forces to avenge the death of Mahama, the oppressive chief of Bawku who was killed in an attack by a force of Busangas (Bisa) and Kusasi. The Mamprussi attack caught the Kusasi off guard. Without adequate preparations or defense, the Kusasi were forced to take cover in the hills. When the Mamprussi cavalry readied to attack the hills, an enormous swarm of bees appeared, descended upon them, and scattered them away. For the Agole, the event confirms the validity of their claim to the land. The bees were the land god's means of protecting his people and driving away the Mamprussi. One of the best examples of a "shrine of the land" in the settlement of Zorse is found in the subsettlement of Natenga. The land god is named Akasong and is represented by a large stone, called a tengkugr, or "land stone," at the foot of an enormous baobab tree. When it was first set into the ground, the stone was located at the front of the compound occupied by Ade'ed, the man who, along with his brother Akpar, is credited with founding the settlement of Zorse. In popular belief, the grave of Ade'ed was purposefully placed next to the land god. The association of the stone and the grave illustrates the melding of land and social groups represented by the land gods. The spirit of the land is fused with the spirit of the founding ancestor, and this provides the ultimate rationalization for establishing and maintaining reciprocal relations with the land. Akasong is served with sacrifice and provides spiritual protection and guidance because the land god is, at least in part, infused with the spirit of the apical ancestor of the residents of Zorse. Two other land gods oversee Zorse: Alume and Akpas. Like Akasong, Akpas and Alume are tengkugr, their shrines being large stones set into the ground at the foot of large trees. The relationships between the three land gods are familial relationships. Alternate versions exist for the nature of their familial connections. In one version, Akasong is the grandfather, Alume the father, and Akpas the mother to all of the local land spirits within Zorse. A second version portrays Akasong and Akpas as husband and wife, with Alume as their son. In this latter version, the tree that belongs to Akpas grows out of the grave of Ade'ed's wife. Within the subsettlement of Natenga, Akasong is also called Abangkasong in honor of a historical event involving a former earth priest of Zorse named Abanga. Abanga prophesied that after his death he would return in the form of a tree growing out of the stone of Akasong. His descendants were told that they were not to make sacrifices to him at his compound shrines, but, rather, they were to serve him as part of serving Akasong. Some time after Abanga's death, a tree began to grow out of Akasong's stone. Abanga's prophecy was validated, and his</page><page sequence="12">34 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH descendants began to serve him as part of the rites for Akasong. The office of earth priest is the highest position of ritual authority within Kusasi culture. The association of land god to earth priest is akin to a charter between the people and the land. Abangkasong demands service because it is infused with the spirit of the land, with the spirit of the apical ancestor of the people who occupy the land, and with the spirit of a powerful ritual and spiritual leader of the people. As a rule, the individual responsible for serving the land gods in a particular territory is the genealogically senior male of the social group that occupies that territory. Thus the senior son of the genealogically senior maximal lineage in Zorse serves Akasong. He is the earth priest, or tengindana, for the entire settlement. Each maximal lineage has its own land god, and the procedural rules are the same; seniority denotes authority over and control of the land god. In this sense, land gods are territorial markers that divide the Kusasi homeland into smaller and smaller areas of human habitation. Taken together, the land gods in Bawku East District form a hierarchy that is made up of a number of different tiers or levels (Table 1). At the top of the hierarchy is the land god Agole, which represents the subtribe and the territory occupied by the subtribe. Beneath the subtribe are individual clans that inhabit individual settlements. Thus Zorse and the Zuos clan have the land god Akasong. Lower still we find land gods for subsettlements and maximal lineages. In this regard, Abangkasong, Alume, and Akpas are served by the maximal lineage called Ade'ed dabog that occupies the subsettlement of Natenga within Zorse.

Land gods are not only ritual and spiritual locales, however; they are also discrete spatial markers that orient people's movements and activities. Agole hill is the dominant feature in the landscape of Agole territory. After three or four months living near to the hill, my wife and I learned, following local practices, to chart our movements between subsettlements by our proximity and bearing to the hill. Settlement and subsettlement land gods are also landmarks people use to orient movement in and through the community. The need for landmarks and other such reference points became readily apparent to us when, while walking to Akpagogo from Natenga East, we asked Cletus where the border was between the subsettlements. He made a vague and rough gesture to the east in front of us. When pressed, he explained that one is not supposed to directly point out the borders of</page><page sequence="13">SHRINES AND THE DOMESTICATION OF LANDSCAPE 35 territory. Delimiting and quantifying land is strictly frowned upon if not actually prohibited.4 Fortunately, subsettlement land gods are located near to the borders between subsettlements (Figure 2). With knowledge of which land god belongs to which maximal descent group, one can determine one's topographical location or position. The outward material signs of land gods are correlated with their relative importance. Land gods that are "places of power" are monumental natural features, associated with powerful spirits affecting large numbers of people and covering a wide territory. Land gods that are "earth shrines" are less spectacular and have direct influence over much smaller territories, though they are still of substantial size. The monumentality of land gods is an important component of their influence and power. Historically and prehistorically, land gods were the most permanent features on the landscape. They were ritual locales for rites of intensification involving the largest segments of Kusasi society. Residents of Zorse acknowledge their membership in the clan that holds claim to the settlement by participating in the rituals and ceremonies that occur at Akasong. Ritual connections to Akasong denote social relations between the maximal descent groups that make up the Zuos clan. Likewise, participation in the rites and observances at subsettlement land gods is an expression of membership in the maximal descent group that claims the subsettlement as its founding territory. Thus land gods are involved in maintaining the relationships that make up the social order. 0- . .*10 0 km 1 Sakpanatenga --. / 9*e \ ....... ... Sakpyango 8 " 7* e6 .5.

They are ecologically valued because they provide sanctuary for various indigenous animals and plants. Agole hill is presently a government forest reserve, and in the more distant past it served a similar role. Because it is a sacred place, people have not and do not live or farm directly on the hill. People use the hill, however, for grazing animals and gathering plants and tree parts as ingredients for medicines. Agole is not unique as a reserve. Settlement and subsettlement land gods are also reserves. In the village of Yarigungu, at the western foot of Agole hill, is a crocodile pond that is the home of a land god called Akalok. The pond is a miniature nature reserve that provides precious habitat for indigenous floral and faunal species. Restrictions are placed on the activities that take place around the pond. People are allowed to maintain dry-season farm plots adjacent to the pond, but they are not allowed to interfere with the animals and plants that live there. Trees, for example, are not harvested as firewood or cleared for new farm plots. The boundaries of the pond are maintained under the order of the earth priest of Yarigungu, the authoritative head of the cult. It is, however, acceptable to harvest parts of the trees for preparing medicines. The other land gods in the present data set are governed by similar restrictions. The ecological role played by Agole includes issuing directives concerning when it is time to begin burning brush lands. On a seemingly arbitrary night, the hills are set afire. No person admits to starting the fires, nor is anyone directly blamed for the act. Instead, the hills are said to have started burning on their own account. Once the hills have been burned, people commence burning brush lands in the territory. An almost identical tradition associated with shrines has been described in Malawi, where the burning season "was opened with the ceremonial burning of a hill by the priesthood of the Bunda shrine in the first week of September and no burning was allowed before that date" (Schoffeleers 1978a:3). Land gods are often drawn into political agendas. During the 1996 national election, the earth priest of Zorse was asked to attend a rally and to pour libations in honor of a candidate from the ruling party in Ghana, the National Democratic Council. The earth priest did attend and poured libations for the candidate. What was unique about the rite is that the earth priest did not directly invoke the land gods of Zorse. During the libation a young man sought to correct this oversight, informing the earth priest he had yet to say the names of the land gods. The earth priest promptly reprimanded the young man, asking loudly, "Who is pouring this libation?" Following the rally it came to our attention that the earth priest had already poured libations for a different candidate whom he himself favored. Political candidates realize that following local traditions and customs pertaining to the land gods facilitates gaining favor in the eyes of the people. Land gods play a role in political discourse as instruments of control and domination and as instruments of revolution and resistance. Consider the account of the Mamprussi defeat at Agole hill, when the land god intervened directly on behalf of the Kusasi. The story embodies Kusasi resistance to Mamprussi rule and</page><page sequence="15">SHRINES AND THE DOMESTICATION OF LANDSCAPE 37 Kusasi claims of an inherent right to live in Agole territory wherever and however they please. A more dramatic instance of land gods becoming symbols or focal points of resistance is that of the Tong hills, site of a powerful shrine recognized throughout the Upper East Region and serving as a rallying point for acephalous populations since long before the British arrived in the late 1800s. The British recognized the importance of the shrine to those resisting their rule and decided to dynamite the cave where the shrine was located-a display that would show northerners that resistance was futile. The attempt failed, and the Tong hills became an even more powerful symbol of resistance (Goody 1990). Appealing to land gods and other spiritual forces or entities as a means of enhancing political power has a long history amongst the Gur-speaking peoples of Northern Ghana and neighboring Burkina Faso and Togo. In particular, officeholders in the centralized states of Mossi, Mamprussi, and Dagomba depended upon establishing and sustaining links between ancestors, land gods, and the blood lines of their chieftaincies. According to Fage (1959), the principal reason for the remarkable stability and continuity of these states seems to have been their rulers' success in using ancestor-worship and their own quasi-divine position as the descendants of the nations' founders to form the various descent-groups into nations whose members, whatever their origins, thought of themselves as Mossi, Dagombas or Mamprussis. Only a few of the original descent groups escaped being moulded into these new nations. Oral traditions and historical accounts tell how Gbewa, the founding ancestor of the chiefly lines from the centralized states, was the leader of a foreign cavalry. After several exploits to the west and north of present-day Kusasi territory, he and his men settled at Pusiga and assimilated to the local populace, marrying local women and adopting the local language. After his death, Gbewa's descendants moved south, founding the Mamprussi and Dagomba kingdoms, and north, where they founded the Mossi chiefly line. Near Pusiga is a large hole in the ground wherein is said to dwell a large python. The hole and snake form a land god called Gbewa, recognized throughout Kusasi territory as a powerful shrine. Generally, for those of Mamprussi descent, this land god is a "shrine of the land," commemorating the founding ancestor of the chiefly line. In contrast, the majority of Kusasi view this land god as a "place of power," associated with mythological events and people. Given the historical accounts of Gbewa, it appears the Mamprussi sought to extend their hegemony through ritually associating their political authority (reliant upon control of the means of destruction) with the autochthonous spiritual authority embodied in the land gods. The association of the historical figure Gbewa to the land god is similar to the melding of land god and ancestor occurring in the Zorse land god Abangkasong. This sort of spiritual fusion appears to be the product of political maneuvering; a particular segment of a maximal descent group or clan seeks to take control of a</page><page sequence="16">38 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH land god. These actions restrict the office of earth priest to those who descend from that particular segment rather than to the genealogically senior lineage within the maximal descent group or clan. In the case of Abangkasong, Abanga predicted that after his death a tree would grow from the stone enshrining the land god Akasong. He said this tree would be his bugr (the courtyard/compound shrine he initially inherited from his mother's father's descendants) and that his bugr would "move with" the land god. In order to serve his bugr, Abanga's descendants had to serve the land god. Men within the maximal descent group from different segments were effectively excluded from serving the land god because they could not possibly serve Abanga's bugr; this right belonged to Abanga's senior male descendant. Figure 3 illustrates how the association between bugr and land god excludes different men from holding the office of earth priest. For the sake of example, ego is an earth priest, and his bugr melds with a land god subsequent to his death. The source of this bugr is ego's mother's brother or father. Only individuals who share the blood of ego's mother and hence the blood of her parents can serve ego's bugr. If ego's bugr were not associated with the land god, then descendants of ego's father and junior wife could occupy the office of earth priest. By virtue of ego's bugr being associated with the land god, all descendants of ego's father and junior wife are excluded from holding the office of earth priest. Those who descend from ego's father's brothers or from ancestors of earlier generations are also excluded from holding the office of earth priest. Why would other segments within the maximal descent group accept the notion that Abanga's bugr melded with the land god? In all likelihood, Abanga's descent group was large enough and had enough support from others to make the claim with little or no anticipated resistance. Assuming that Abanga's prophecy was publicly known, people would, however begrudgingly, accept the logical O-A 0TA 0-A OA O-A F-- r- 1i--1 S A O0 AO AO AAO --A 0--A A AO 0 A AA AA AA A Excluded from occupying office of earth priest A Able to occupy office of earth priest Figure 3. Kin Tree Showing Individuals Excluded from Holding the Office of Earth Priest</page><page sequence="17">SHRINES AND THE DOMESTICATION OF LANDSCAPE 39 consequences (i.e., Abanga's descendants have to serve the land god). Note, however, that regardless of the fact that the office of earth priest is restricted to Abanga's line, control of the land god still resides within the maximal descent group. This is quite different from the story of Gbewa because Gbewa did not belong to a maximal decent group or clan and, furthermore, he was not an earth priest but a military ruler. To more fully parse Gbewa, we have to consider the circumstances surrounding the founding of settlements. Again, we can turn to Zorse for further insight. Two brothers, Ade'ed and Akpar, were forced to flee their natal settlement by seven senior brothers of the same father but a different mother. The two brothers escaped, wandered until they discovered a suitable place to establish compounds, and founded the settlement of Zorse. The story illustrates the inherent tensions between members of different courtyards within the same compound and between comparable segments within maximal descent groups. The conflict prompting the flight of Ade'ed and Akpar stemmed from a sacrifice wherein the senior brothers refused to give the junior brothers a share of the meat. Refusal of a rightful share of sacrifice is an explicit denial of membership within a group. In this case, Ade'ed and Akpar were denied membership in the residential group. (It is tempting to think the shrine involved with the sacrifice was the compound shrine, or bugr, controlled by the seven brothers as the senior offspring in the residential group.) Ade'ed and Akpar were juniors, and this means that they did not have a bugr. Fleeing their natal home, settling in Zorse, and having Ade'ed marry a daughter from a family settling in Zorse after them, the brothers acquire a bugr, and this ultimately is what is enshrined in the land god Akasong. The situation with Gbewa is similar because like Ade'ed and Akpar, Gbewa had no bugr. He could only get such a shrine by marrying a local woman. At his death it was this shrine that was associated with the land god. Note, however, that Gbewa's descendants could not rightly make claims to serve the land god because they did not belong to the bloodline of the maximal descent group controlling the shrine. None of them could become earth priest. This is not to say that the association between land god and apical ancestor did not have serious sociopolitical ramifications. Rather, the ritual association likely served as the foundation for the emergence of a new form of political and social authority in northern Ghana-chieftaincy and the centralized state. LAND GODS AND CEREMONIAL LANDSCAPE Kusasi land gods are ritual locales forming a ceremonial landscape. Land gods may be distinguished on the basis of the size of territory they oversee and the size of the social group to which they are associated. The paramount land god, Agole, for example, oversees the Agole subtribe and Agole territory. Each settlement has its own land god as does each subsettlement. Ideally, single clans control settlement land gods, while single maximal descent groups control subsettlement land gods. In practice, subsettlements and settlements are generally occupied by</page><page sequence="18">40 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH more than one maximal descent group or clan, and control of the land gods is vested in the senior maximal descent group or clan (i.e., the group that descends from the ancestors who first erected the shrine and thereby founded the community). Within Zorse, people who are not members of the Zuos clan may only settle in the subsettlement of Akpagogo. Members of the maximal descent groups within the clan may live in any of the subsettlements that form the settlement, though particular descent groups are identified with the particular subsettlements founded by their apical ancestors. The ancestor shrine (bugr) that transforms into a land god is enshrined at a large tree marking the front yard of the ancestors' abandoned compound. The founders of the present social order are fused with the land by enshrinement (a process described previously for the land god Abangkasong in the subsettlement of Natenga). The tree comprising the shrine is a product of nature, yet it owes its existence and survival to human intervention. It is not necessarily that people planted the tree, but they most certainly cared for it, kept the goats and other foraging animals away from it while it was small, and made it an essential fixture of their home.5 The tree is a product of the dwelling of ancestors; it embodies their lives and actions, providing a constant reminder to the living that the spaces in which they move were created and moved through by others before them. Such land gods are landmarks for local histories. Land gods that are "places of power" are where the inherent spiritual force of the land manifests and is engaged through ceremonies, rituals, libations, and sacrifices. "Places of power" are timeless places, formed from natural forces prior to human occupation; they commemorate the initial covenant between the founders of human settlement and the spirit of the land. Though they may be associated with historical events, they are rarely connected to specific historical persona. Rather, they are associated with mythical persona or spiritual forces, and hence the history they represent transcends the histories of local communities. The natural features comprising "places of power" exist prior to and independent of humans, while the constituent parts of "shrines of the land" exist as a result of human activity and interaction. The difference between the types of land gods is a matter of degree. "Places of power" are as much a part of the domestic landscape as "shrines of the land," and "shrines of the land" are nature reserves and thus inhabited by the same wild species of animal and spirit found at "places of power." Furthermore, relations between land gods are nearly always conceived in terms of human relations, and in this sense, all land gods are culturally construed. Agole, for example, has a wife, the land god Agolpo'a. Similarly, many residents of Natenga refer to their three land gods (Akasong, Akpas, and Alume) as father, mother, and child. LAND GODS AND THE DOMESTICATION OF LANDSCAPE The anthropomorphism of land gods is part of an overall strategy of domestication, of integrating land and spiritual forces with human communities. Enshrinement is the initial stage in this strategy. The living can negotiate with an</page><page sequence="19">SHRINES AND THE DOMESTICATION OF LANDSCAPE 41 enshrined spirit, whereas an unenshrined spirit is impossible to predict and capricious, tries to create discord, and is largely beyond human influence. When a spirit is enshrined it is incorporated into a house. This occurs both literally, in the case of spirits enshrined in objects located in compounds, and figuratively, in the case of the land gods which are permanently fixed to the social order, representing the bloodlines or rooms that exist in larger social groups or houses. Once enshrined, a spirit is obligated to act in the interest of those who serve it. Correspondingly, those who enshrine a spirit must be vigilant in their service lest the spirit grow disenchanted and angry with them. Enshrinement bridges the divide between the "wild" and the "house," giving the living opportunity to influence the spiritual causes of physical events and circumstances. Morris's (1995) distinction between the village and the woodlands in rural Malawi corresponds with the Kusasi distinction between the "house" and the "wild." When the Kusasi enshrine a spirit, they capture a bit of the essence of the "wild," bringing with it the essential characteristic of the whole, namely, the blending of opposed categories and the resultant power such blending generates. At the same time, they are frequently recapturing or reintegrating ancestor spirits, former members of their community. In this sense, enshrinement is the culminating state in the transition of a social persona from living member of the community to ancestor; enshrinement is initiation and domestication of spirits. Land gods are domesticated spirits of the land. They are not simply an assertion of human dominance over the land. Indeed, enshrinement does not offer strict guarantees. Droughts, famine, disease, and other social ills stemming from conditions in the natural environment continue to exist. At best, the Kusasi hope to influence the disposition of the land gods, and in fact, they view land gods as social authorities, as is witnessed by the position of land gods within the social hierarchy as apical ancestors of social groups and progenitors of the social order. CONCLUSIONS: LAND GODS AND SITES OF MEDIATION From a normative perspective, Kusasi land gods are a passive reflection of recognized and accepted supernatural, social, and political categories. The shrines are emblems that denote the existence of and membership in specific groups, lineages, clans, tribes, and the like. The rules associated with the shrines provide a framework that enhances the process-individuals who belong to specific groups are obligated to attend and participate in the ceremonies and rituals at specific shrines. From a practical perspective, individuals and groups can use shrines and their associated ceremonies to negotiate and renegotiate supernatural, social, and political categories. People can choose not to attend ceremonies at specific shrines and thereby refute or dispute the normative framework. Similarly, individuals and groups can erect new shrines, hold ceremonies at new shrines, recruit others to attend the ceremonies, and thereby alter normative categories. The cases of Abangkasong and Gbewa illustrate the practical strategies specific groups can employ to gain control over the land gods or to associate their authority with the supernatural authority of the land gods.</page><page sequence="20">42 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH The Kusasi use land gods as sites of mediation, places where the normative and practical sides of social life meet. Land gods encapsulate (literally enshrine) the ambiguity and unpredictability that characterize social life. They simultaneously express social difference and social similarity by delineating groups into "those who attend ceremonies" and "those who do not attend," denoting who does and does not belong to specific social groups. They combine the oppositional and complementary relations that make up Kusasi society. Thus, in a normative sense, they reinforce the fact that lineage segments of the same order are different from one another and yet also belong to a lineage of a higher order of segmentation and are therefore the same. From a practical viewpoint, land gods provide an arena for challenging and transforming normative categories. The mediation that occurs at land gods is not only social and political; it also involves the supernatural and natural, the invisible and visible, and the concealed and revealed. Land gods make accessible the invisible forces and meanings that are concealed beneath the visible world, thereby opening opportunities for reiterating established meanings and generating new ones. NOTES 1. Research would not have been possible without the encouragement, understanding, and participation of the residents of Zorse, the late Zorsenaba, the Tengindana, and my interpreter, Cletus Anobiga. The Ghana Museums and Monuments Board kindly extended a research permit for the fieldwork. Dr. Nicholas C. David provided funding support through the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. This research was conducted as part of the Mandara Archaeological Project (Ghana Phase) directed by Nicholas C. David. Finally, I would like to thank the anonymous JAR reviewers who provided such helpful suggestions for improving this paper. 2. In anthropological terms, conceptualized and articulated engagement constitutes participant observation. 3. Criticisms leveled at the aesthetic expressed in landscape portraits, created by painters, which privileges visual perception can be reworked and cast at the chosen alternative, created by academics (writers and readers), which conceptualizes landscape as text or narrative and thereby privileges textual ways of perception and knowing. 4. In a related vein, counting one's possessions is extremely bad form and is likely to bring misfortune and trouble. Our discovery of this belief occurred during our many interviews where we asked interviewees how many adults lived in their compounds. In every case, interviewees named household members individually rather than just telling the number of compound residents. On one occasion, I made the mistake of counting a man's chickens. Cletus voiced his displeasure and amazement and then seeing my bewilderment, quickly informed me of my blunder. 5. It is impossible to overestimate the value of having a tree in the front yard to provide respite from sun and heat.</page><page sequence="21">SHRINES AND THE DOMESTICATION OF LANDSCAPE 43 REFERENCES CITED Asombang, R.1999.
