U Chicago P. 217 pp. $75.00 he. A study on sf and empire sounds like a massively ambitious project, and indeed it would have to be in order to cover the intersection of two such broad concepts. Patricia Kerslake's foray into the arena is not as wide-ranging as its title implies but is a good, broad-based volume. Considering that postcolonialists generally only look at one or two particular works or the sf of a particular nation, Kerslake's contribution to the discussion is worthwhile as a proper theoretical approach to the genre as a whole. The first half of the volume examines the nature of both empire and sf and leads Kerslake to ask what role "empire" as a concept plays in the genre as well as how that role serves society. Chapter One explores the postcolonial relationship between Self and Other; in sf, she points out that the Other, whether anthropomorphic or monstrous, friendly or hostile, is almost always truly alien. Even humans who are considered Other are literally alienated, living in or returning from some far-off place or time. The second chapter, "Silencing and Cultural Appropriation," looks at the way the Other is treated by the mainstream or Center. Kerslake provides specific examples in Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968) and John Wyndham's The Midwich Cuckoos</page><page sequence="2">502 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 35 (2008) (1957). She shows how the Other is repressed and ultimately destroyed by humanity in both works, although, interestingly, silence and appropriation are barely mentioned. She rounds out this part of the book with Chapter Three, "Metaphor and Empire," and Chapter Four, "Relativity, Distance, and the Periphery." Each of these chapters is meant to strengthen Kerslake's premise that sf is an ideal genre for the exploration of postcolonial issues. In the former, using works by Stanislaw Lem and Ursula K. Le Guin, she explicates extended metaphors of power and Otherness; in the latter, she shows how the re-imagining of distance required for a galactic or intergalactic empire highlights the problematic relationship between Center and Periphery. The three succeeding chapters move away from background in postcolonial critical thought and toward postcolonial analysis of specific sf visions. Chapter Five compares Kurd Lasswitz's and H.G. Wells's two very different pictures of Martian invasions in Two Planets (1897) and The War of the Worlds (1898), which are read here as parallel and startlingly similar indictments of the barbarity inherent in imperialism. The next chapter, "American Greats," looks at Robert A. Heinlein's political philosophies and Isaac Asimov's robot Other as perhaps the nation's most influential sf. This chapter and the one that follows, "Homofuturis and the Imperial Project," are a bit unfocused. The former, regarding Heinlein, tries hard not to discuss his work as a whole but cannot settle on one tale to examine; it ends up bouncing from story to story before fitfully landing on The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress (1966) and Stranger in a Strange Land (1961). The "Homofuturis" chapter seems to be about more contemporary sf and even begins with a list of twenty-first-century titles; it then undertakes comparisons between them and mid-twentieth-century sf before almost inexplicably turning to the 1960 novel A Canticle for Leibowitz. It is not until Chapters Eight and Nine that Kerslake truly examines recent works, specifically Kim Stanley Robinson's 1990s Mars trilogy and Iain M. Banks's Culture series, begun in 1987 and still running. The chapter on Robinson provides the strongest postcolonial reading in the book, as Kerslake illuminates Robinson's paired problematics: the Mars pioneers become colonists ruled by a distant, imperial authority; at the same time, those very pioneers are settlers invading and conquering (via terraforming) a foreign land. The reading, which incisively discusses colonization's relationship to such concepts as the environment, technology, revolution, narrative, and character, shows the possible scope and power of postcolonial analysis when brought to sf. It also hints at the direction a future post-imperial society might take. Unfortunately, the Banks chapter is a bit too exuberantly uncritical of his work. The Culture series is presented as a potential example of "true" postcoloniality even as some of the cited examples show that Banks's future Culture uses its power to subvert and control other societies in a reiteration of classical imperial models. Kerslake moves deftly?though sometimes too rapidly?between theoretical discussion and concrete examples, and in spite of the huge amount of ground covered, the discussions and arguments are expanded thoroughly. As might be expected, however, there are some significant omissions. Most of the works examined are forty or more years old; while this in itself is not problematic,</page><page sequence="3">books in Review 503 Kerslake does not explicitly mention that the study is largely limited to classic or Golden Age sf. Perhaps more glaring?at least to some readers?is the absence of any mention of Octavia E. Butler, who is arguably the genre's strongest voice for postcolonialist thought. In fact, much of sf seems glossed over. William Gibson is mentioned a couple of times in passing, but cyberpunk and its children are not seen at all. There is, along with the bias toward classic sf, a pronounced but unacknowledged focus on aliens, invasions, and literal empire, even though there are occasional mentions of more metaphorical colonization. The text wants to be ambitious about the amount of material to be covered but disciplined about not straying out of control. In the end, it is more successful than not at both goals, which is an admirable achievement. Science Fiction and Empire is thought-provoking and insightful, and is, regardless of its flaws, the kind of large-scale postcolonial work that sf has needed for quite some time.?Bola C.
