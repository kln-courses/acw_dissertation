<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vigiliae Christianae 41 (1987) 105-138, E. J. Brill, Leiden FURIHER OBSERVATIONS ON THE STRUCTURE OF PHILO'S A LLEGORICAL TREATISES* BY DAVID T. RUNIA In a previous article published in this journal I made a number of comments on the structure of Philo's allegorical treatises.' That article began with an evaluation of two stimulating studies devoted to the analysis of individual Philonic treatises. The observations put forward in the final section took the results of these studies as their point of departure. In the present article I wish to present some further observa- tions on the same subject, this time approaching the problems involved from a more general perspective. There is no need, I believe, to apologize for returning to the subject of the structure and organization of Philo's allegorical treatises. Until recently, as we shall soon see, very little scholarly attention had been devoted to it. And yet this area of investigation is vitally important for at least three reasons. To start with, it is going to help us in the practical task of reading and studying these works if we have some idea of what Philo's aims and methods were in composing them. This is even more indispensable if we should make the attempt to read a Philonic work with others, e.g. with a group of interested students. Secondly, our understanding of what Philo was endeavouring to achieve in his allegorical interpretation of Moses will be increased if we gain some in- sight into the structural mechanics of those treatises in which his maturest allegorical ideas are presented. Finally, this subject can help us gain an improved view of the ever-controversial issue of Philo's Sitz im Leben, both with regard to his place within the Judaism of his day, and in relation to the dominant Greek culture with which he was so well ac- quainted. The procedure which I intend to follow in this article is not dissimilar (siparva licet) to the method used by Aristotle to such purposeful effect in his school treatises. I shall commence by presenting the results of research carried out on the subject so far. An examination of these</page><page sequence="2">DAVID T. RUNIA results leads to a number of aporemata, and they in turn form the point of departure for the rest of the article. Where my procedure em- phatically differs from that of the illustrious philosopher is that it can- not be the aim to present a comprehensive and definitive account of the nature and structure of Philo's allegorical treatises. As will soon become clear, preliminary research tasks essential to such an enterprise have not yet been carried out, either by other Philonic scholars or by myself. Our ambitions, for the time being at least, will have to be more modest. If these observations help readers of Philo to understand better what Philo is doing in the treatises they are reading, their aim will have been more than fulfilled. It needs to be said at the outset that when I speak of Philo's allegorical treatises, I am first and foremost thinking of that long sequence of biblical commentaries which in modern scholarship has come to be known as the Allegorical Commentary. This is, of course, not to deny the obvious fact that allegorical exegesis also occurs in Philo's other two exegetical sequences, the Exposition of the Law and the Quaestiones. But these treatises have a rather different structure, the relation of which to what we find in the Allegorical Commentary falls outside the scope of this article. Of the twenty-one treatises in the Allegorical Commentary2 I have chosen the double-treatise De gigantibus-Quod Deus immutabilis sit as the example of Philonic exegesis on which my observations will focus in particular. The choice has been made on purely practical grounds. Thanks to the labours of David Winston, John Dillon and their research team, it is now the allegorical work we know best.3 In my previous article I used Quod Deus immutabilis sit as the example. But I now regret having focussed on it alone, to the exclu- sion of De gigantibus, because it has become increasingly clear to me that the two treatises were composed as a single literary unit. This article will presuppose an acquaintance on the part of the reader with the con- tents of the entire double-treatise. I. Status quaestionis Given the daunting productivity of Philonic scholarship and the cen- tral place occupied by the allegorical treatises in Philo's oeuvre, it is surely surprising that the subject of the formal and thematic structure of these treatises had until quite recently received very little scholarly at- tention. The pioneering study of M. Adler had met with only a limited 106</page><page sequence="3">PHILO'S ALLEGORICAL TREATISES response.4 The monographs of H. Thyen and I. Christiansen also failed to rouse greater interest in the subject.5 It was not until the 1970's that scholars turned their attention to the various problems involved. 1. Nikiprowetzky Credit for a breakthrough cannot unfairly be given, I believe, to the late Valentin Nikiprowetzky. In his magisterial study, which, if it had been written in English could have carried the title 'Prolegomena to the study of Philo', he had occasion to look at the context and composition of Philo's exegetical treatises.6 These are not the product of compilation of exegesis practised in the exegetical schools of Alexandria (Bousset), nor a faithful reproduction of preaching activity in the Synagogue (Volker, Thyen). But there is clearly a connection with the exegetical ac- tivity that took place in the Synagogue. The Quaestiones et solutiones in Genesim et Exodum faithfully mirror the question and answer method used for exegesis in the Synagogue, though their greater com- plexity shows that they are meant for a reading public. The Allegorical Commentary represents an elaborated form of the same basic pro- cedure. The formal aspects of the parallels in method between the Quaestiones and Philo's other exegetical works were further investigated by P. Borgen and R. Skarsten in a penetrating article.7 Particular emphasis was placed on Philo's use of certain formulas, such as sopjlaetL 8'av TLo oux &amp;a6 axostoui TC brTcous..., which is an expanded alternative for the basic 8ta zt of the Quaestiones. Not long before his death, as was analysed in my previous article, Nikiprowetzky returned to the subject he had earlier broached. Asked to contribute a structural analysis to the Gig.-Deus commentary, he at- tempted, for the most part successfully, to show that the structure of the work is based on a sequence of 14 sub-divisions of the Biblical text, each basically representing a quaestio et solutio and running parallel to the quaestiones et solutiones located in QG 1.89-99.8 Seen in this perspective, the work has a coherent and logical structure. Philo, in Nikiprowetzky's view, is an 'auteur clair'. But note that this coherence is presented precisely in terms of the basic structure, and not as the result of thematic or conceptual unity. Between the various sub- divisions the French scholar perceives a good measure of discontinuity. 107</page><page sequence="4">DAVID T. RUNIA 2. Hamerton-Kelly In an exploratory article which has been undeservedly neglected,9 Robert Hamerton-Kelly undertook to show how Jewish and Hellenistic cultures blended in Philo, not only on the level of ideas, but also on the level of literary composition, i.e. in the way he constructs the allegorical treatise De agricultura. The Hellenistic side comes forward in Philo's use of the method or technique of diaeresis (as shown by Christiansen, but her claim that the whole allegorical method is based on it is a patent exaggeration). The Jewish side is articulated by means of a comparison with the traditions of midrash, and in particular the technique of gezerah shawa (inference by analogy), one of the seven middoth or ex- egetical norms attributed to Rabbi Hillel. By demonstrating the role of these two techniques, Hamerton-Kelly could explain to his own satisfac- tion the composition and structure of the De agricultura. It emerged that the form of gezerah shawa used by Philo was based on verbal analogy rather than analogy of thought. 3. Cazeaux It would appear that, after decades of hard labour, Jacques Cazeaux has entered a period of harvest. In the space of two years he has pub- lished not only the massive study on Philo's literary structures reviewed in my previous article, but also two shorter accounts based on the results of the larger work, as well as another study in which two additional Philonic treatises are analysed at considerable length.'0 The response of the scholarly world to Cazeaux's novel and provocative approach must be awaited. My own critique was, it cannot be denied, rather negative in some of its conclusions. In other Philonists it may strike a more responsive chord. It is not my intention to give another summary of Cazeaux's thesis. Suffice it to say that he argues the total and unconditional coherence of the structure of Philo's allegorical treatises. By means of the twin prin- ciples of substitution and redundance," both founded on the assump- tion of the unity of scripture, Philo is able to achieve complex and elaborate structures of meaning. It is of paramount importance to re- cognize that the exegetical 'deep-structure' which Cazeaux postulates is not developed on the surface of the text, but rather moves at a 'sub- terranean' level, a procedure that imitates the 'slowness' of the biblical text and is quite inimical to the discursive rationality of Greek thought. 108</page><page sequence="5">PHILO'S ALLEGORICAL TREATISES The reader himself experiences this movement as he proceeds through the treatises. By following the signposts that Philo conceals in his ex- egetical structures, he completes a spiritual itinerary parallel to those of the Patriarchs recorded in scripture. It is above all the complexity and intricacy of Cazeaux's structural analyses-in his magnum opus 140 diagrams are needed to elucidate them-that must astound the reader. Philo the disorganized rambler is replaced by Philo the supreme structural orchestrator. But has this made him any more accessible? 4. Mack Another scholar who has made highly creative and stimulating con- tributions to our subject is Burton Mack. Most of his work is relevant, but it is necessary to begin by noting an important development in his thinking. In the famous paper that formed the basis of the Claremont Research Project he encouraged a certain atomization of Philo's ex- egesis. By excavating the various exegetical layers present in the treatises, it was hoped that it would be possible to reconstruct the history of exegesis developed in the Alexandrian Synagogue.'2 In two more recent papers, however, the emphasis shifts to the coherent struc- ture of the single Philonic treatise or part thereof.13 Scripture, according to Philo as read by Mack, is encoded. The task of the exegete is to decode it, and in so doing Philo makes extensive use of the methods of rhetorical elaboration. Mack suggests that the elaboration of the chreia (i.e. a brief account of a saying or action on the part of a well-known historical figure) may have served as a model for Philo in his exegesis (i.e. elaboration) of the Mosaic scriptural lemma. In the first article this suggestion is worked out with reference to the single lemma given ex- egesis in Sacr. 1-10; in the second article it is further extended to an analysis of the entire treatise De sacrificiis. An objection to this attempt, put forward by H. D. Betz in an unpublished critique, is that it imposes the techniques of a speech genre on Philo's text, rather than the com- mentary genre that one would naturally expect. It should be further observed that Mack's approach shares some common ground with the structuralist views of Cazeaux. The logic of analogy and elaboration is not intended to lead the reader to a single conceptual grasp of a system of truth. Instead the process of moving logically from one set of signs to another creates a space, and it is there 109</page><page sequence="6">DAVID T. RUNIA that the 'truth' resides. The conceptuality is in fact very difficult to spell out. 'It is with process as an experience that Philo has achieved some- thing remarkable. This is the way in which the process of following the elaboration becomes an intellectual exercise which corresponds to the psychological experience intended as the "truth" to which scripture calls.' 14 5. Runia It would be more decorous to pass over the contents of my article in silence, but since it forms part of work done in recent research, one or two indications will have to be given.15 Its chief concern was to draw at- tention to the fact-also exploited by Cazeaux, but in a quite different way-that Philo, in interpreting the main biblical text on which the treatise focusses its concern, habitually feels the need to invoke secon- dary texts from elsewhere in the Pentateuch (and rarely from other biblical books) in order to elucidate the deeper meaning of Moses' words. All these texts form as it were the skeleton of the treatise, on which the flesh of its allegorical contents is draped. Of particular in- terest was the question of what actually determines the choice of these secondary biblical texts. In an analysis of Deus it could be shown that the transitions from the one text to the next are in about fifty per cent of cases based on verbal parallels in the actual text, while in the remain- ing fifty per cent they are motivated by thematic considerations. This reveals the strong emphasis Philo places on the actual wording of scrip- ture. But the vitally important question of whether Philo imposes a con- ceptual and thematic unity on his treatises had to be left unresolved. 6. Radice Also south of the Alps valuable research is being carried out on Philo, especially in the circle around Prof. Giovanni Reale of Milan. Just recently an Italian translation of six Philonic treatises (including Gig.- Deus) has been published. It contains an introductory section by Philo's latest (and very thorough) bibliographer, Roberto Radice.'6 Radice begins with two interpretative postulates. Firstly he insists that Philo must be seen as an exegete, and not as a philosopher. Secondly he agrees with Cazeaux that there are strictly speaking no digressions in the allegorical treatises. How then can we explain the 110</page><page sequence="7">PHILO'S ALLEGORICAL TREATISES repetitions and general disorganization of argumentative procedure that is undeniably present in them? (Note that in admitting this Radice im- mediately parts company with Cazeaux again.) Radice introduces a distinction between the directive idea, which can be conceptually for- mulated and gives the treatise (or even groups of treatises) its unity, and the specific themes which emerge in the various chapters (equivalent to quaestiones et solutiones) of the treatise and can allow a good deal of thematic discontinuity. A second integrative element-again at least partly in agreement with Cazeaux-is that Philo's departure from and return to the main text takes the form of a circular procedure. It is within this closed circle, as a 'comprehensive semantic unity', that the various allegorical terms find their definition and the directive idea is worked out.17 On the subject of the structure of the individual 'chapter' or pericope Radice also provides some interesting observations. Philo's procedure is compared with a staircase. The main biblical text is analysed, whether explicitly or implicitly, in terms of question and answer. The solutio answers the quaestio, but also has a surplus element, which causes an- other biblical text to be called in, which itself has a surplus element, and so on. The process repeats itself until Philo reaches where he wants to be. Consider what happens in Sacr. 72-79:'8 Lev.26:10 'old'(relative) * 'young' (absolute) Num.11:16 'old' = worthy of respect Lev.19:32 'hoary' : 'old' Lev.2:14 'young' : 'old' Gen.4:3 basic text The exegesis thus moves in jumps. The unity is supplied not so much by the themes utilized, but by the controlling directive idea. II. Results and aporemata The summary of recent research just outlined has been necessarily im- pressionistic and incomplete. Enough has been said, however, to justify the conclusion that, although there are undoubted points of consensus, it is still the points of disagreement that have the upper hand. Let us begin with the former. 11</page><page sequence="8">DAVID T. RUNIA (1) The most important result of the above survey is the complete agreement on the fact that Philo must be regarded first and foremost as exegete of Mosaic scripture. The primary focus of his activity is on explaining the scriptural text, and above all on penetrating to its hidden deeper meaning. Philo has apologetic aims, arguably also philosophical aims, but these are primarily effectuated by means of his exegetical ac- tivity. It is easy to take this insight for granted, but we should bear in mind that it is in fact still quite new. On Philo's hermeneutic assump- tions there is as yet a basic split, some scholars asserting that 'Philo's claim is to be able to master the master','9 others favouring a more deferential role on his part.20 (2) Turning now to the structure of the individual treatise, we can say that there is considerable agreement on the fundamental role of the main biblical text in supplying the basic continuity of the exegesis. Most scholars regard the divisions which Philo introduces into the text as the basis for the various sections of a treatise, generally called chapters. (3) The thesis of Nikiprowetzky and others that the procedure of the quaestio followed by the solutio is fundamental to the structure of the allegorical commentaries has met with a good deal of approval. There is a link, it is generally surmised, with exegetical praxis in the Alexan- drian Synagogue, even if Philo's finished products are much more sophisticated and presuppose a high level of nati8r a on the part of the reader. The above points of consensus are most useful, but remain character- ized by a fairly high level of generality. As soon as we move to more detailed treatments, it is the points of disagreement that strike our atten- tion. I summarize them under three headings. (1) There seems little agreement on the basic structure and procedure of the Philonic 'chapter'. Is there a uniform method (e.g. the quaestio and solutio) that is repeated over and over again, or does Philo exhibit a diversity of approaches? Is there, furthermore, a marked difference between structural methods used in various treatises, or do the similarities remain greater than the differences?21 The role of the secon- dary biblical texts which Philo habitually introduces is also controver- sial. All will agree that Moses is being explained via Moses. But do these secondary texts merely function as illustratory material, or do they take on a life of their own? (2) The second problem area is a continuation of the first, but with wider implications for the understanding of a treatise as a whole. To 112</page><page sequence="9">PHILO'S ALLEGORICAL TREATISES what extent does Philo endeavour to impose a structural coherence, first on a chapter, then on the series of chapters that make up a treatise? Is there a total coherence, or a certain measure of discontinuity between chapters, or-a third alternative-a continuity of a somewhat ca- pricious, associative kind? And, if there is coherence, or at least a controlling 'directive idea', is this of an intellectual kind which is to be grasped by the mind as a kind of dogma, or is it rather meant to be 'ex- perienced' through reading the treatise? Finally, it is also worth asking the question of how difficult Philo intended his treatises to be. (3) The third disagreement is implicit rather than overt. Can light be shed on Philo's procedures by means of comparison with other writings, whether Jewish of Greek? Or is it better to regard Philo as a writer sui generis who, even if he had antecedents or colleagues in the Synagogue, developed his own style and method? Of the scholars reviewed only the two Americans Hamerton-Kelly and Mack adduced comparative material. The remainder preferred to base their findings exclusively on internal analysis of Philo's own works. The results just outlined set the parameters of what I aim to achieve in the remainder of this paper. It should by now be clear that at least two major pieces of research need to be carried out before any definite conclusions can be reached on the structure of Philo's allegorical treatises. Firstly, a systematic comparison must be made between the Allegorical Commentary and the Quaestiones in Genesim et Exodum, and especially those parts of both works which give direct exegesis of the same main biblical lemmata. Secondly, a structural analysis, made with as few preconceptions as possible, must be made of all the allegorical treatises from Leg. to Somn. Every time a scholar bases con- clusions on a small or partial segment,22 he or she runs the risk of reaching conclusions that are only partially valid and can be con- troverted or modified in the light of material drawn from other treatises. A third major piece of research could also be proposed, namely a comprehensive comparison of Philo's structures with other forms of ex- egesis, both Greek and Jewish, produced at approximately the same period. Compared with the other two projects, however, we cannot be certain that the results will be as remunerative. Nevertheless I intend to give a sample in this paper by comparing Philo's structures with three other types of exegesis. This will give us some perspective on the third 113</page><page sequence="10">DAVID T. RUNIA of the problem areas mentioned above. Thereafter I will address the other two problem areas, concentrating my observations on the evidence in Gig.-Deus. Finally, by way of conclusion, I will bring for- ward what I consider to be the single most important issue raised by our subject. III. Some comparisons It is a fact we have to learn to live with when studying Philo that it is easier to use his evidence to cast light on his surroundings than to use his surroundings to cast light on him. There is no other reason for this than the fortuities of transmission. Our supply of literature written about the time of Philo is rather thin, and this applies not only to Hellenistic-Judaic writings, but also to Greek works produced in Alex- andria and elsewhere. The fact that we are looking for exegetical works restricts us even more. But let us see what we can come up with. 1. Anonymous Theaetetus Commentary The first document may in fact be roughly contemporary with Philo. The first editors of the Anonymous Theaetetus Commentary, Diels and Schubart, dated both the papyrus and the original to the second century A.D.23 But very recently H. Tarrant has proposed an earlier dating on philosophical grounds. He is even prepared to credit it to Eudorus or his circle, i.e. 50 B.C. or a little later.24 The papyrus as we have it com- prises about 40 sheets and contains the initial part of a Platonist com- mentary on Plato's dialogue Theaetetus (up to 153e). On the value and quality of the fragment there has also been a divergence of opinion. Dillon regarded it as maintaining 'a level of stupefying banality',25 but Tarrant is inclined to take it more seriously and attempts to derive im- portant evidence on the development of Middle Platonism from it. Although the entire document is interesting for purposes of com- parison, I shall concentrate my remarks on two passages, 34.9-35.44 and 56.11-57.42.26 I am sure that every Philonist who reads these ex- tracts will recognize similarities with and parallels to Philo's exegesis. The commentator subdivides the Platonic text into short lemmata, which he comments on one by one. The use of the quaestio method, i.e. the explicit or implicit raising of &amp;aoptat in the text is particularly marked. Note how at 34.22 the question is introduced by Sta -t and is 114</page><page sequence="11">PHILO'S ALLEGORICAL TREATISES attributed to anonymous exegetes (T7roi6)a...). The reply takes the form of a multiple exegesis. First two opinions of unnamed exegetes are given (34.35 TtveS cpaaLv, 35.13 'vtot 81 apeaOxovrxa). The third alternative is modestly presented, but clearly receives the author's support (35.21 LIriCOte alE?tvov I XeYetV Ot ...). Both the exegetical multiplicity and the modesty are frequently paralleled in Philo.27 Some of the more detailed interpretative techniques also strike us as familiar. The word cp71(a is enough to indicate Plato (57.16 etc.), just as in Philo it often denotes Moses. Words from, or just outside, the lemma under discussion are quietly introduced into the exegesis (e.g. LoavOavouotv at 56.16). When it suits the interpretation small words are closely looked at and their natural meaning violated (wtoc at 35.18ff., 57.32ff.). The interpretation of e6pioxtLV at 56.14ff., which draws atten- tion to a distinction between finding and refinding, is uncannily reminis- cent of Philo's exegetical comment on Gen.6:8 at Deus 86.28 Other Platonic texts are invoked as 'proof' of a given interpretation, e.g. at 56.26. But there are also significant differences to be observed. Although the commentator practises the Middle Platonist hermeneutic principle of explaining Plato via Plato and so is eager to adduce other texts, whether in order to resolve a possible conflict (57.15) or as proof (57.26), these secondary texts never lead to separate developments as in Philo. There is a more direct concentration on the subject at hand. At the same time the commentator, who after all is dealing with a text of considerable length (and not a single page or less of Pentateuchal text), adopts a more 'atomistic' approach, with jumps from one subject to another. No at- tempt is made to connect one pericope with the next (though the author does retain a perspective on the larger developments of the dialogue, cf. 57.40). Finally the difference in subject matter is to be noted. The com- mentator, following Plato's text, is interested in explaining philo- sophical difficulties and tackles philosophical issues. He is not in- terested in an immediate application to the reader's own concerns.29 The work is much less 'spiritual' than Philo's allegorical exposes.33. 2. Porphyry's De antro nympharum A greater affinity, both in subject matter and method, we find in the treatise in which Porphyry gives an allegorical exegesis of Homer's des- cription of the cave of the nymphs (Odyssey XIII 102-112)3' Having 115</page><page sequence="12">DAVID T. RUNIA quoted these lines and defended a non-literal interpretation, the Neoplatonist philosopher proceeds to give a compact exegesis of them in terms of an elaborate symbolism comprising themes from both physical and psychological allegory. It is true that there is a considerable chronological disparity between Philo and Porphyry. Not only, how- ever, is this little work the only continuous piece of exegesis of a single Homeric text that we have,32 but Porphyry also makes it quite clear that he is heavily indebted to the Neopythagorean Numenius (and his pupil Cronius), who in turn doubtless made use of earlier exegesis.33 Once again numerous parallels of content and technique strike the eye. Porphyry extols the virtues of Homer and defends the poet's allegorizing intent (?36), just like Philo does in the case of Moses. The quaestio method is again in evidence (?15 8ta t; ?32 XetiTaLt e 8 7capaCt7aicLat...O6t nOTE vlVU6et). Words are etymologized (?15) and names explained (?35) with allegorical intent. Stress is placed on the ap- propriateness of the symbolism (?19 olxZac au,43oXa etc.). At the same time Porphyry evidently accepts the practice of exegetical polyvalence, admitting more than one explanation for the same symbol (e.g. ?19), but usually making quite clear which interpretation he favours. The balance between physical and psychological allegory differs from what we Philonists are accustomed to. But, for example, the allegorical ex- planation of the blinding of the Cyclops in terms of freeing oneself from the life of the senses (?35) could come virtually straight out of Philo. It is, however, above all the structural elements that should claim our attention. Here, too, there are certain shared characteristics, but I find them rather elusive when examined more carefully. For example, Por- phyry has the tendency to string examples together and then call himself back to the main task at hand (e.g. ?31 &amp;XX' i'a t...xTv Xoyov 7x6vuvwv, cf. Congr. 178). Is this parallel to Philo's method of concatenation? In fact there is a basic difference between this work and Philo's allegorical treatises, because very little remains in it of a commentary in the strict sense of the word. To be sure, Porphyry quotes the Homeric text at the beginning and returns to it at intervals (?15, 32), but he does not divide it into lemmata which he deals with one by one. Thus the very first line of the text is dealt with last (?32), because in this way he can organize the work so that it reaches a climax in the psychological allegory of Odysseus, the wandering soul. The structure is thus more like that of a Hellenistic ouyypa'. ja (a fine parallel is Plutarch's De animae procrea- tione in Timaeo, also a piece of exegesis), with the result that one can 116</page><page sequence="13">PHILO'S ALLEGORICAL TREATISES more easily obtain an overview of the whole work than in the case of Philo's treatises. Can we speak of "secondary exegesis" in Porphyry? The philosopher certainly deepens and illustrates his interpretation by referring to other texts. These have a wider range than in Philo, e.g. cross-references to Homer in ?16 &amp; 34, but also to Mithras mysteries (?15), Orphica (?16), Sophocles (?18), and so on. The connections are made on thematic rather than on verbal grounds.34 We do not find the quasi-independent developments which are one of the main reasons that Philo's allegorical treatises are so much longer, more complex and more repetitious. 3. Palestinian midrash We now make a considerable jump from the Hellenic affiliations discussed so far to a possible Palestinian connection. In so doing I do not presuppose any firm views on the thorny question of Philo's rela- tion to Palestinian Judaism. It is not unlikely, I believe, that there were parallels between the methods of interpreting scripture practised in Alexandria and in Palestine, even if it is (so far) not possible for us to pin these down precisely.35 But what is midrash? For Hamerton-Kelly, following the proposal of R. Le Deaut, 'Midrash is a mode of thinking which may be described but not defined'.36 I find myself attracted to the new approach of G. Porton, who does make the attempt to define it by focussing on its for- mal or literary aspects. He concludes his discussion as follows:37 In brief I would define midrash as a type of literature, oral or written, which stands in direct relationship to a fixed, canonical text, considered to be the authoritative and the revealed word of God by the midrashist and his audience, and in which this canonical text is explicitly cited or clearly alluded to. Speaking with specific reference to the terms of this (admittedly wide) definition, I believe we can legitimately regard Philo as a Hellenizing midrashist, for Philo expounds, and specifically cites or alludes to, a written canonical text which both he and his audience regard as divinely inspired and authoritative. (An immediate difference in relation to Palestine midrashists is that Philo places much more emphasis on the authorship of the divinely elected prophet and lawgiver Moses, but this difference is subordinate.) Porton goes on to outline a variety of types of midrash, ranging from Targumim (Aramaic translations or paraphrases) to Rabbinic midrash. 117</page><page sequence="14">DAVID T. RUNIA The last-named is again divided into homiletic and expositional types.38 Since the latter follows the biblical text verse by verse, it would seem closest to Philo and thus what we are looking for. For purposes of il- lustration I have selected some passages from the Mekilta of Rabbi Ishmael and Genesis Rabbah. Once again chronology is a problem. Both works belong to the earliest Rabbinic midrashim, but in their present form cannot antedate the third or fourth centuries A.D. at the very earliest. It is, however, abundantly clear that they contain much traditional material, some of which may be virtually contemporary with Philo.39 It is also possible that in their formal aspect they have adopted methods used earlier. At any rate it was not difficult to locate texts that can be profitably compared with Philo's procedures. In the Mikilta each chapter is devoted to a section of the biblical text, which is further split into smaller lemmata. My example is the first chapter of the Tractate Pisha, in which exegesis is given of Ex. 12:1.40 We observe that, after the lemma has been cited, a brief explanation is given, which is immediately followed by an objection (equivalent to an exegetical &amp;iopta), either stated by the exegete (1.2) or put into the mouth of the reader (3.30). The objection is raised not so much because the text is unclear, but in relation to other Bible texts. Thus the first ob- jection results from the juxtaposition of Ex. 12:1 and 6:28. The response is also given in terms of Bible texts. In fact the secondary biblical texts are much more copious than in Philo (in our extract 54 texts!). At 3.31ff. the exegete justifies his response by appealing to the hermeneutic rule of kal vahomer (e minore ad maius), one of the seven middoth of Hillel. We note also how the secondary texts quoted can lead to quasi-independent developments. The question of the place of revelation leads after much meandering to the example of Jonah, who tried to escape from the land of Israel and God's presence (7.1). Next there is a section on three kinds of prophets (among whom Jonah), con- taining a diaeresis which we could easily find in Philo (8.12ff.).41 The connection with the beginning of the pericope (3.29) depends entirely on the enchainment of themes. Nor is there any attempt at the conclusion of the discussion to return to the initial theme (cf. 11.3f.). The secon- dary developments are less expansive than in Philo, not least because the protreptic themes set in motion by Philo's psychological allegories are wholly missing. In the case of Genesis Rabbah it will be instructive to look at chapters XXVII and XXIX, which deal with sections of the same biblical text 118</page><page sequence="15">PHILO'S ALLEGORICAL TREATISES underlying the commentaries in Gig.-Deus.42 The procedure adopted in this midrash differs from what we found in the previous work. At the beginning of the chapter the biblical lemma is quoted. Then the exegete puts forward another biblical text which at first appears to have little to do with the main text. As the explanation of this text unfolds, the connection is gradually made clear (cf. XXVII ?1-2; note how the game element in midrash emerges here). Although the extreme compression of the presentation often makes the connections of thought difficult to follow, it would appear in this case at least that it is the verbal similarities which led to the choice of the secondary text.43 The comment in ?3 furnishes a fine example of the hermeneutic principle of gezerah shawa (explicitly invoked). The verbal parallel between Gen.6:5 and 18:20 indicates that the punishment inflicted in both cases is the same.44 Chapter XXIX provides a further illustration of how important verbal parallels are for the selection of the secondary biblical texts. In ?3 Rabbi Simon, expounding the lemma 'but Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord (Gen. 6:8)', chains together three texts with the word 'found' and a fourth with 'found grace'. In ?4 other Rabbis compare the lemma with three other texts in which Old Testament figures 'find grace'. Clearly the four texts are arranged in ascending sequence-Noah's grace is less than Joseph's, which is less than Esther's, and so on. Compare Philo's procedure, mutatis mutandis, in Deus 104-116.45 At the same time the vast difference between the way Philo and the Rabbis 'fill in' these texts cannot but strike us. The grace found by Noah leads in Philo's inter- pretation to highflown metaphysics (Deus 107f.), whereas the Rabbis, by referring to Haggadic lore concerning the feeding of animals in the middle of the night, make it quite concrete (?4 ad fin.). 4. Findings Close, but not close enough. That could be the shortest way to summarize the results of our comparisons. If we lump together the three passages, we find that most features of Philo's exegesis could be paralleled somehow or other. Two exceptions must be made to this generalization. Philo's habit of inserting protreptic passages with direct appeal to the reader in his allegories (e.g. the so-called 'diatribes') was not encountered. Secondly, except to a weak degree in Porphyry, we found no attempt to join up the various pericopes or 'chapters' of ex- egesis, such as Philo achieves with his returns to the main biblical text 119</page><page sequence="16">DAVID T. RUNIA and his frequent transitional phrases. Philo's method of composing his allegorical treatises is clearly related to exegetical methods developed by both Greek and Jewish interpreters of authoritative writings (cf. Hamerton-Kelly). My impression-more than that it cannot be called at this juncture-is that the formal aspects have been drawn more from Greek models, while the manner of invoking and handling of the biblical text has a Jewish background.46 Yet not close enough. The comparisons illuminate Philo-as such they have been a useful exercise-, but they do not 'explain' him. We can only guess as to whether this would be different if we had access to more, and especially contemporary, material. My strong suspicion re- mains, however, that Philo is a writer sui generis, who has developed a style and method distinctively suited to his own aims, and not directly taken over from other exegetes and exegetical traditions. I append some comments on points of detail. (1) The method of raising explicit quaestiones or &amp;a7opCat was common to all three examples as well as Philo. If we also add implicit &amp;dopiat, nearly every item of exegesis can be said to be based on this method. But how useful is it then to say that Philo's allegorical exegesis can be analysed in terms of a stringing together of quaestiones and solutiones? (2) The enchaining of secondary biblical texts, especially on the basis of verbal parallels, clearly has its roots in Jewish exegesis. But can we iden- tify this procedure with the gezarah shawa, as Hamerton-Kelly sug- gests? The midrashic examples indicate that gezerah shawa is too specific a hermeneutical principle to fit the bill in the majority of cases. The method of textual analogy is so general a practice that it is not theoretically justified. Only more precise applications of analogy, as in ka vahomer and gezerah shawa, are laid down as rules. Philo's 'verbal mode of transition' clearly resembles gezerah shawa, but cannot be equated with it.47 (3) In none of the passages compared did we come across anything remotely resembling total coherence or a concerted attempt at integra- tion of themes or ideas. Even Porphyry, who is not restricted by the practice of lemma by lemma exegesis, does not achieve this. If such in- tegration were Philo's aim, he would be attempting something quite foreign to the exegetical traditions in close proximity to him. This is worth bearing in mind, even if we should consider Philo to be a writer sui generis. 120</page><page sequence="17">PHILO'S ALLEGORICAL TREATISES IV. Some observations It is time now to turn to our remaining two points of disagreement, and also to our example of Philonic exegesis, the double-treatise (which is actually single) entitled Iepi yLryavTcov 1tepi TOu oi7I Tpe reaO0at 6o 0etov.4 1. Structural organization We have already noted a fortunate aspect of our choice of example, namely that it presents exegesis of the same biblical text dealt with in QG 1.89-99. The parallelism between these 11 quaestiones et solutiones and the structure of Gig.-Deus is not coincidental. 49 Corresponding to each quaestio et solutio is approximately a 'chapter' in Gig.-Deus. I am convinced that the chapter, which we may define as a unit of exegesis in which a lemma of the main biblical text is comprehensively ex- pounded (i.e. so that the exegete can pass on to the next lemma), is a useful concept in analysing the structure of Philo's allegorical treatises.50 It should be noted, however, that in practice it is not so easy to pin these chapters down precisely. Nikiprowetzky's analysis furnished 14 chapters, Winston and Dillon were content with 10 in their commen- tary, while Radice took a midway position and postulated 12.51 Clearly there is an arbitrary element in determining what a chapter is in the ac- tual praxis of Philo's exegesis. The reason for this is equally clear, namely Philo's desire to enchain or 'weave together' his interpretations into a literary whole (cf. auvup9lvotev Deus 20), which we then in our analysis have to divide up again. Take, for example, the question of whether Gig. 55-57 should be seen as a separate section or 'chapter'. Nikiprowetzky and Radice, focussing on the parallel quaestio at QG 1.91, think it is. But a look at the thematics of Gig. shows that the ostopta raised by Gen. 6:3b has been integrated into, or-perhaps better-fastened onto the tail of, the exegesis of Gen. 6:3a, so that it is better to follow Winston and Dillon and regard the whole of Gig. 19-57 as a single unit. Deus 20-85 gives rise to greater complexities, for we find that (1) Gen. 6:7 is cited fully twice (at ?20 and 51), (2) at ?70 the whole of ?51-69 is treated as a preliminary enquiry rather than the answer to the main a&amp;opta, and (3) in ?70-85 an answer has to be given to the a7copia of Gen.6:7 before the main theme (i.e. the contrast between the judg- ment in 6:7 and the grace in 6:8) can be broached. Another indication 121</page><page sequence="18">DAVID T. RUNIA of the fluidity of Philo's chapters is evident in their variation in length, ranging from 5 capita (Gig. 1-5) to 44 (Deus 140-183).52 The next problem is unquestionably more difficult. Can we say that Philo uses a fixed method in composing the chapters of his treatise? I am less convinced than other scholars-Nikiprowetzky, Cazeaux, Mack-that he does. The role of the quaestio or a&amp;opta is undoubtedly important. We find explicit quaestiones at Gig. 1, 56, Deus 1, 33, 70, 86, 104, 122, i.e. in more than half the chapters. But the method is too general to be really informative. Philo's manner of returning to the main biblical lemma can easily suggest the circular 'cradle' structure proposed by Cazeaux (followed, with reservations by Radice). But his 'imperialism of symmetry' can by no means be imposed on all chapters without straining the reader's credibility. Gig. 1-5 shows clear affinities with Sacr. 1-10, the chapter Mack analysed in terms of the chreia- elaboration. But, once again, it is impossible to detect such a structure in every chapter. A suggestion I would wish to put forward is that it is useful to distinguish between Philo's use of exegetical procedures and exegetical techniques. By the former I mean the regularly recurring methods used by Philo to construct the development of a chapter of his exegesis. Some of these, but not usually all, will be found in every chapter. Sometimes they are quasi-formally introduced, more often Philo employs them im- plicitly. The following list will indicate which procedures I envisage (plus in each case an example in which a formal indicator can be detected):53 (a) introduction (or transition from preceding chapter) e.g. Deus 33 xoavcx; ouv StrtXtyJeivot 7rEpi T.ou... &amp;xoXo6uOwx an7o8awaoJLevv,t &lt;TcL T.o...

I have distinguished between (c) initial observation and (e) detailed allegorical explanation, because it appears that Philo likes first to 'break open' the text by means of an initial observation (i.e. an &amp;itopta, objec- tion, distinction etc.), before proceeding to a more detailed explanation in terms of his exegetical system. We should note that it is especially in (f) and (h) that secondary biblical texts are invoked, but that it also hap- pens in (d), e.g. in Gig. 22-27. The sequence of procedures (though not necessarily all of them) occurs once per chapter, unless, as sometimes happens, Philo deals separately with two or more parts of the biblical lemma as quasi-independent units in the one chapter, e.g. Gig. 19-57. Moreover the same procedures can be invoked to deal with a secondary biblical text cited to explain or deepen our understanding of the main text, e.g. Gig. 32-46. This leads to the phenomenon which Nikiprowet- zky has called the 'quaestio a tiroir',54 and which can be regarded as a 'chapter within a chapter'. Exegetical techniques, on the other hand, have a more direct relation to the contents of the biblical text. Their task is to focus the attention of the reader on one particular aspect of the lemma, which, once it is understood, leads to a better understanding of the lemma as a whole. (There is a close relation to the acopla., the 'hints' or 'pretexts' used to justify the allegorical method.55) They are, therefore, especially promi- nent in procedure (c), the 'breaking open' of the biblical text. Examples of such techniques are: report of an objection (Deus 21); making a distinction (Deus 86) or establishing a contrast (Gig. 1); making a gram- matical observation (Deus 141); outline of a diaeresis (Gig. 60); laudatio of the lawgiver (Gig. 58) etc. Many of these techniques we found paralleled in the non-Philonic exegetical passages analysed for purposes of comparison earlier in this article. 123</page><page sequence="20">DAVID T. RUNIA Having made this distinction between exegetical procedures and ex- egetical techniques, I remain with the difficulty of how I should deal with the practice of posing a quaestio, which, as we have seen, occurs on eight occasions in Gig.-Deus. Contrary to Nikiprowetzky and others, I regard its use as insufficiently consistent for it to be regarded as a fixed procedure. Not only is it often hard to decide whether there is an actual quaestio or not; we should also note that it can sometimes amount to no more than a formality, as for example at Deus 86, where the quaestio asks only what the text means, and then immediately a further exegetical technique is required to break open the text. I think it preferable to view the quaestio as Philo's favourite way of introducing the initial observa- tion which allows him to break open the text under discussion. It is therefore not itself an exegetical technique in the limited sense I en- visage, but can be used to usher in such a technique (cf. also Gig. Iff.). In Appendix 3 I have undertaken to give a structural analysis of De gigantibus in terms of the procedures and techniques just outlined. Per- sonally I find the result no more than partially successful. It does show, to my mind, that in general terms these categories are valuable for the task of understanding how Philo builds up his treatise from the inter- pretation of the one biblical lemma to the next. At the same time, how- ever, one retains the feeling that there is an element of coercion or imposition involved in our analysis. Philo's structures are too fluid, too flexible to allow us to 'decode' them in a way that might render them 'accounted for' or in any way predictable. There is a method, but no fixed procedure or 'system' whose secret code we have to 'crack'. For this reason I remain convinced that it is highly important to observe the central role played by both the primary and secondary biblical texts in establishing the structure of Philo's exegesis. This obser- vation was the basis of the analysis of Deus carried out in my previous article, and I have retained its salient features in the analysis of Gig. These texts together form the framework upon which the exegesis is based. The main biblical text, from which the exegesis proceeds and to which it returns, is dominant. But a number of the secondary biblical texts (not all) are given a role that is hardly less important than that of the main text. It is striking that on the only two occasions that Philo gives a phrase for phrase detailed exegesis of a longer biblical lemma in Gig.-Deus, he does so of a secondary text (Lev. 18:6 at Gig. 32-46, Num. 20:17-20 at Deus 145-180). In discovering the connections be- tween the various texts, we can to some degree retrace the associations 124</page><page sequence="21">PHILO'S ALLEGORICAL TREATISES made by Philo in composing his treatises. Philo feels justified in making these associations because he assumes that scripture is a coherent whole. They are so often based on verbal parallels because he considers that one of the fundamental ways that Moses conveys the coherence of his thought to the reader is through his careful use of language and phraseology.56 2. Discontinuity, unity, or total coherence? But to what extent does Philo himself aim to impose a unity or coherence on his own treatises as structured literary compositions? Is he an emulator of Moses in this regard, as Cazeaux claims? We turn to our final point of disagreement. In so doing we need to add a consideration of the content of Philo's treatise to the purely formal aspects on which we have concentrated so far. Gig.-Deus is a continuous commentary on the text Gen. 6:1-12. Can it be said that Philo derives from this text a central theme which per- vades the work as a whole? Winston and Dillon, without addressing the question directly, furnish the following answer57 Overriding themes, therefore, in this pair of treatises, are the duality and tension between the spirit and the flesh, virtue and pleasure, self-abnegation (or God-centeredness) and self-centeredness; the nature of God's providential care for us, not governed by any pas- sion, as a superficial reading of the inspired text might suggest, but purely by reason; and, as a corollary, our responsibility for our actions, our freedom of will, and the role within us of the Logos, acting as a conscience. We note that they speak of 'overriding themes' rather than a central theme. Radice, in contrast, does speak of a 'dominant idea':58 Thus the actual meaning, the dominant idea of our treatises is that of the 'generation' of evil, where the term 'generation' takes on a quite specific meaning, as Philo himself defines it in Deus 119: '...Generation is a kind of passage or journey from non-being to being... but there is also another, the transformation from a superior genus to an inferior species.' The generation of evil should be seen as a process of degeneration from the good or, also, as the turning-point of the corruption of the world. But this is precisely the theme of Gen.6, where it is presented in direct connection with the figure of Noah. Hence... the theme of degeneration and that of virtue are systematically contrasted... The title of the treatise should properly be 'Of the corruption of the world' or 'On the generation of evil'. It is the same theme as in the tetralogy (Cher.-Post.), but now viewed from a 'historical' rather than an 'archetypal' or 'psychological' perspective. Radice, in my view, goes too far here in his emphasis on the negative side. The biblical text might warrant such pessimism, but Philo reads it 125</page><page sequence="22">DAVID T. RUNIA otherwise. Just as in Post. the birth of Seth halts the downward spiral of Cain's progeny, so in Deus Noah balances the forces of disintegra- tion. I agree with Winston and Dillon that Philo bases the thematics of his treatise on the fundamental dichotomy between the spirit and the flesh suggested by the biblical text. The title of the work also draws attention to this dichotomy, albeit not very clearly.59 The question is: what does Philo do with this opposition? Do we get a series of 'variations on a theme', which look at the opposition from various angles, deepen our understanding of it by introducing contrasts and comparisons, explore the diverse ramifications indicated by the biblical text, until we receive an all-round picture? This is surely what Nikiprowetzky had in mind when he emphasized the discontinuities between one chapter and the next.60 Winston and Dillon, with their 'overriding themes' may mean the same. There is one extraordinary facet of Philo's exegesis which holds me back from accepting this quite plausible view. I have in mind the sur- prising turn that Philo gives to his lengthy exposition of Gen. 6:11-12 in Deus 122-183. By a clever selection of secondary biblical texts (especially from Lev. 13-14 and Num. 20) Philo introduces the role of the XeyXoS as logos or conscience. I cannot see how there is any hint of this doctrine in the main biblical text (it is not related to the X&amp;ptS of Gen. 6:8). But Philo needs it because he is keen to show that the chasm that divides spirit from flesh and virtue from vice does not separate the world into two permanent camps. It is possible for the soul which is not wholly impure (cf. the last caput ?183) to listen to the admonition of the inner monitor, to better its ways and join the people of Israel on the Royal road. It is possible because the soul, as emphasized in the philosophical exposition of Deus 35-48, has the freedom of will to turn to good or evil. The text at the end of this section, Deut. 30:15 &amp; 19 (?50), sums it up perfectly. As so often in Philo, we can hear the pro- treptic element ringing through loud and clear. It is this unexpected extrapolation of the biblical text which persuades me that, in this work at least, Philo does have a main theme or a direc- tive idea (I borrow the term from Radice) which has played a decisive role in determining the treatise's structure. If Philo was simply taking the main biblical text lemma by lemma, expounding the themes he hap- pened to find there (as in the Anon. Theat. Comm. and in the midrash), then what takes place in the last quarter of the treatise would be inex- 126</page><page sequence="23">PHILO'S ALLEGORICAL TREATISES plicable. Nor should we be tempted to conclude that Philo at the end of the work loses control over his material, filling up his papyrus roll by expatiating on a new theme that is only marginally related to the main biblical text. The move is premeditated. As Cazeaux has shown, Philo sometimes anticipates a biblical text which he will later exploit. A good example of such 'teleology' is found at Gig. 29. When Philo writes i np6oS aapxa o(XeCOatS with reference to the main biblical lemma (Gen. 6:3), he knows already that he is going to invoke the words of another text cp6S avTca olxsTov aopx6o auc'ro6 (Lev. 18:6). Now it seems to me that, when Philo at Gig. 64 speaks of Abraham following the Royal road, we have a strong indication that he has already planned to develop this theme at the end of the treatise. The association made between the 'way of flesh' in Gen. 6.12 and the King's way in Num. 20:17 is legitimated by the verbal parallel between the texts. It is motivated by the central theme which Philo extracts from the allegorized biblical text. It cannot be said, therefore, that the work lacks a thematic focal point, for Philo has manifestly manipulated his exegesis in order to pro- vide it with one. The treatise has at the least a unity of a loose kind. But it is possible to go a step further and claim that Philo has attempted a large-scale integration of the multivarious exegetical themes he has called into service, so that the work is given a fundamental thematic coherence (cf. above all Cazeaux's approach). This I think he does not do. I give a few examples of the kind of themes that occur in different chapters and might encourage us to look for a tight-knit structural coherence. (1) Is it structurally significant that in Gig. 2 there is a contrast etS/tcoXuavOptiota, but in Deus 148 an a fortiori analogy Ets a&amp;viqp i'voS oXuavOptonTraTov, while in ?178 a noXuavOpuo7tov g'vog sinks into oblivion? (2) Is it structurally significant that Onan is used as an example in Deus 16 and Tamar in ?137? (3) Is it structurally significant that in Deus 77 unmixed wine is associated with God and mixed wine with man, but that in ?158 God gives the people of Israel unmixed draughts (cf. also Gig. 52)? (4) Is it structurally significant that Gig. begins with atyy.XLot ov-1pot (cf. Ps. 77:49 cited in ?17) and Deus ends with the ayysXoS as X6yos oiLog (cf. Ps. 90:11-12 alluded to in ?182)? However tempting it may seem to attempt to integrate such thematic parallels, I think the temptation should be resisted (in the final example the conscious literary device of symmetrical inclusion may be suspected). Because Philo tends to repeat themes and ideas at regular in- 127</page><page sequence="24">DAVID T. RUNIA tervals, and moreover likes to look at them from various points of view (depending on where and how the biblical text leads him), there is an almost infinite number of possibilities for the analyst to make connec- tions and set up contrasts that Philo himself does not make explicit. Such attempts, in my view, are self-defeating. They immediately plunge the interpretation into such labyrinthine complexities that the basically lucid structure of Philo's treatises, based on the alternation of main and secondary biblical texts, cannot but be lost to view. Moreover they encourage us to neglect the importance of looking first of all at the relation between the exegetical interpretation and the biblical texts (primary and secondary) on which the interpretation is based. Once again some examples may clarify the point at issue. (1) In Gig. 60-64 the interpretation of Gen. 6:4 leads Philo to distinguish between men of earth, men of heaven, men of God. In Deus 104-116 examples of the biblical expression 'found grace' lead to another triad Joseph, Noah, Moses. In both cases we recognize in the background the familiar hierarchy of 6 6cau6Xo, 6 tpox6oTov, 6 -rxEtog. But is this parallel structurally important for our reading of Gig.-Deus? Naturally Joseph is in the camp of Nimrod and the men of earth. But Philo makes no effort to bring out any connec- tions. For the men of earth the chief characteristic is addiction to the flesh. The allegory of Joseph and the chief jailer differs: here the account concentrates on 7raOog (o&amp;ap not found in Deus 110ff.). The allegorical thematics of Abraham and Noah also diverge. Abraham's O9op(ta ro xo6 x ou (because he is a man of heaven) is quite extraneous to the virtue/vice thematics of the treatise as a whole. (That Noah is called rqlxtx6s xa 7t oXuuta- fis in ?107 is not enough to connect him up with Abraham the ckXoFLa0iOS in Gig. 60ff. The object of their &amp;(La0qts is given a quite different content.) In both chapters Philo lets the allegorical themes be dictated by the texts (primary and secondary) given exegesis. Hence the atomistic features of both chapters when looked at in the context of the treatise as a whole. (2) Some men worship God in love, others in fear (Deus 69). For the latter the lawgiver has included the anthropomorphic and anthropopathic passages in scripture. Key words are vouEoiaa and aToppovi(eaOa (cf. ?52). When eight lines before the end of the treatise (?182) Philo writes 'id vouO0ao( xaci ac(ppovKLap, it is not likely that he has forgotten his earlier usage (cf. also Gig. 47). But is the repetition of structural significance? Clearly Balaam belongs to the men of earth (y^Ti 9p?(l.a, cf. Nimrod and also the acactxo cpikXot of Deus 55). But the words are also applied to 'us' (cf. xa&amp;Toxuv) walking along the high road (Xe?o96popu 6ou, cf. Israel in ?146). Do 'we' also belong to the dim-witted or miseducated for whom the literal sense of scripture is meant (Deus 63)? Surely not, for Philo right through the treatise is acquainting us with the deeper sense. In other words, if we try to make a direct correlation of Balaam, 'us' and the angel in ?181-182 with the act1axo citXoL, uXis cpiXot and Moses in ?51-69, we raise more problems than we solve. My chief quarrel with any attempt to detect a complete thematic coherence in Philo's treatises is that it conflicts with the principle of the finality of the Philonic text.6' Philo's self-imposed task as commentator 128</page><page sequence="25">PHILO'S ALLEGORICAL TREATISES on scripture is to elucidate the words of Moses. If he is actually inviting us to make all kinds of structural connections between various parts of the work without making these explicit, then he is evidently not serving his own purpose. Because in that case we really need a second commen- tary to determine what Philo's own deeper meaning is. 3. Experiencing a treatise? But maybe I am on the wrong track. Maybe Philo does not want a reasoned articulation and integration of the meaning of all the themes he introduces into the various stages of his exegetical structures. Maybe what he wants is that we 'experience' the process of passing from flesh to spirit as we read our way through his structured exposition of the biblical text.62 My view is that this approach is in fact less attractive or useful than it might sound. Every writer aims to have some effect on the reader who reads what he has written, even when the aim is purely transmission of knowledge. This applies afortiori when the knowledge imported is ex- pected to have direct effect on people's lives, as can be the case in phi- losophy and religion. Plato's Phaedo, to take a famous example, is a strongly protreptic work. Its readers are meant to experience the pull of the philosophical life, and there are some well-known anecdotes of oc- casions when it did have that effect.63 But surely our admiration for Socrates is only worth anything in Plato's eyes if we are convinced by what he says and see an authentic relation between his arguments and his deeds.64 To speak of our experience is only to 'double' our accept- ance of the philosophical contents of the work. Literary structure, con- ceptual content and experience can only be artificially separated. Is the situation any different in Philo? The central role of the protreptic element in Gig.-Deus has already been stressed. Admittedly Philo does not give chains of argument to justify the philosophical con- ceptuality he employs in order to explain the Mosaic message.5 He ac- cepts the validity of the 'language of reason' and expects his reader to do the same. His task, as he sees it, is to persuade the reader of the validity and viability of the relation he sets out between Moses' words and the conceptuality which is contained in or hidden behind them. This process of persuasion is 'experienced' by the reader in his reading of the treatise. The process would lose its raison d'etre if the content of the conceptuality was hollowed out and replaced by the experience alone. 129</page><page sequence="26">DAVID T. RUNIA We must therefore slightly alter the formula we used in the case of Plato. To speak of our experience is only to 'double' our acceptance of the relation made by Philo between scripture and the philosophical con- ceptuality required to explain it. Because we accept this, we become more and more convinced during our reading of the treatise that spirit is superior to flesh. We follow the call to live the life of the spirit, which is the philosophical life understood in Philonic terms. 4. Concatenation The most distinctive feature of Philo's allegorical treatises from the literary point of view is his desire to connect together his exegetical ex- planations into a continuous chain. This distinguished these works from the Quaestiones. We also found it difficult to parallel in our section on comparative material. Without doubt the hermeneutic practice of explaining Moses via Moses (virtually absent, note well, in the Quaestiones), encourages en- chainment. Moreover, if I may permit myself a psychological specula- tion, Philo appears to have possessed a strongly associative mind, whose thought is quickly 'triggered' by parallels (verbal and thematic) and analogies.66 Nevertheless I am persuaded that the chief reason for Philo's concatenative tendency is literary, and is probably derived from rhetorical theory and practice. This is suggested, for example, by his use of the word auvtpco.67 Philo appears to use it as a kind of technical term for composing or giving a speech (Congr. 64, Mut. 61, 198, Decal. 94, Spec. 1.344 etc.), but also uses it to describe his own procedure in his treatises (Congr. 178, cf. Virt. 16). Philo has, I suspect, taken over the ideal of concatenation, such as was practised in the speech genre, in the writing of his exegetical works.68 But he has not, pace Mack, taken over the fixed procedures of rhetorical theory by means of which rhetors were trained to produce their Eipgoi Xoy&amp;wv, for these were not suited to the practical requirements of the exegete. V. A crux in our reading of Philo This paper is already long enough as it is. But the reader will forgive me if I indicate as briefly as possible what I consider to be the most im- portant issue raised by our discussion. 130</page><page sequence="27">PHILO'S ALLEGORICAL TREATISES Philo's allegorical treatises are complex structures consisting of en- chained exegesis of primary and secondary texts. Every treatise has a different main biblical text, allegorical exegesis of which leads to the ad- junction of secondary texts drawn from elsewhere in the Pentateuch (and rarely from outside it). Each chain of texts and concomitant themes is unique, for each time there are different texts and chains of association involved. (This is not to deny, of course, that there is much repetition in Philo, but this is due to the limited number of basic allegorical themes and also to the fact that he tends to use a number of biblical texts (and also etymologies) over and over again as a kind of allegorist's stock-in-trade.) The question is: if each of Philo's exegetical chains is unique in the way described, is it legitimate, when we are discussing a theme in Philo, to sever a portion of the exegesis from its place in the structure of the treatise in which it is found, or is the meaning of that portion intrin- sically related, or even determined by, its place in the structure?69 Naturally, the answer to this question will be dependent on how we view the structure of Philo's treatises. Pan-structuralists, who find an integrated structural coherence in the allegorical works, will surely be inclined to answer the question in the negative. My own view is that, because Philo regards himself as a disciple and expositor of Moses, we as interpreters must always relate his statements to the biblical texts on which they are explicitly or implicitly based. In practice this ensures that we will always be careful to look at the context of his words. But, because I am persuaded that from the conceptual and thematic view- point the treatises have at most a loose unity, and that, moreover, the conceptuality of a treatise should not be subordinated to or replaced by the experience undergone in reading it, I conclude that it is permissible to examine or utilize a Philonic passage in isolation from the thematics of the treatise in which it is located. Fortunately, perhaps, for it is often hard to do otherwise. Appendix 1: translation of extracts from the Anonymous Theaetetus Commentary (a) 34.9-35.44 'And in this way taking every single case in turn up to the root of seventeen square feet; but at this point for some reason he came to a halt (Plato Theaet. 147d5-6)'. Just as in the case of the roots of squares representing three and five square feet (cf. Theaet. 147d4), 131</page><page sequence="28">DAVID T. RUNIA so he also presented the other similar roots and demonstrated that they are commensurate in respect of the plane surface area [which they can form, cf.148b2], but not in respect of the sides, like in the case of six square feet, seven square feet and the others one by one up to seventeen square feet, excluding nine and sixteen square feet. There are those who inquire why he proceeded to seventeen square feet and then stopped. And some say that Theodorus, as an expert in geometry and music, combined geometrical and musical theories, the question of roots being geometrical, while the seventeen square feet is musical. For this (number) represents a limit (or a stopping point), because the (musical) tone is not divided into equal semitones. For, as the tone is (formed) in the ratio of nine to eight, if you double the eight and the nine, the products are sixteen and eighteen. Of these the middle number is seventeen, which divides the upper and the lower into unequal proportions [i.e. 17/16, 18/17], as has been demonstrated in our commentary on the Timaeus. Some (others) are of the opinion that, in counting out the roots, he just hap- pened to stop for some reason where he did; but the phrase 'he for some reason came to a halt (147d6)' constrains that one inquires as to the reason for his stopping. Perhaps it would be better to affirm that he proceeded to seventeen square feet because sixteen square feet reveals that only the square whose area is sixteen square feet has a perimeter and a surface area that are (numerically) equal. This is the square with a side of four. For four sides each of four units make sixteen. But also the square formed by (sides of) four is sixteen; for four times four is sixteen. Squares that fit inside the tetrad (i.e. 4 x 4) have an area (numerically) less than the perimeter... (b) 56.11-57.42 'But they themselves have found in themselves many fine things and given birth to them (Theaet. 150d7-8).' How do the souls still recollect, if they either learn (cf. 150d7) or find? But also those who lose something and later recover it are said to 'find'. In fact he does not always use the word 'recollection', but only when this is the primary focus of atten- tion. He made that clear when he said in the Meno, 'let there be no difference whether we say it is teachable or reminded' (paraphrase 87b7-cl). 'But of the delivery the god and I am the cause (150d8-el).' For the thoughts are insuffi- cient to produce the wise man, unless there is someone besides who will articulate them. 'With some (of these men) the daimonion that is present in me forbids me to associate, but with others it does allow me (151a3-5).' The word 'allows' (is used) instead of the words 'is not opposed', since the daimonion of Socrates was not always dissuasive, but sometimes encourages him to associate. 'My craft (of midwifery) is able to arouse this pain of childbirth and to cause it to cease (151a8-bl).' My craft arouses the pain of childbirth that results from bewilderment (cf. 151a7) whenever it raises questions that are not straightforward, while it causes the pain to cease whenever it renders assistance by supplying starting-points and guiding the part- ner in the dialogue. 'But in the case of some, Theatetus, who do not seem to me to be somehow pregnant (i.e. in their minds) (151b2-3).' Yet in the Symposium he says that 'all men are pregnant both in soul and in body' (206c-1), and it follows that this pregnancy of the soul is recollection. How, then, can he say here that some men seem to him not to be pregnant? In this case we should understand the words 'in this life'. For the souls are unable to summon up these recollected thoughts every time they are embodied, even if it was possible once. So it was 132</page><page sequence="29">PHILO'S ALLEGORICAL TREATISES not for nothing that he places the word 'somehow' before the word 'pregnant', but so that it is understood that they are pregnant 'in some way' according to their current situation. But in the general account it is necessary that they are such (i.e. pregnant).

At 15.37 a protrep- tic theme is raised on the basis of Tht. 145d, but is not used to inspire the reader to emula- tion, as Philo might do. 30 For further remarks on the formal resemblances between Platonist commentaries and Philo's exegetical writings see J. Dillon, 'The formal structure of Philo's allegorical ex- egesis' in Two treatises 77-87; D. T. Runia, Philo of Alexandria and the Timaeus of Plato (Leiden 1986) 502ff. 31 Text and translation by Seminar Classics 609, State University of New York at Buf- falo, Arethusa Monographs I (Buffalo 1969). On this interesting little work see further F. Buffiere, Les mythes d'Homere et la pensee grecque (Paris 1956, 19732) 419-459, 597- 616; J. Pepin, 'Porphyre, exegete d'Homere' in Porphyre, Entretiens Hardt (Geneva 1966) 229-272; also for readers of Dutch, C. Verhoeven et alii, Porphyrius: De grot van de nimfen (Baarn 1984). 32 Homeric exegesis for the most part took the form of &amp;aop(at xal Xu6aE;, i.e. formally parallel to Philo's Quaestiones (cf. H. Dorrie, art. Eratapokrisis RAC 6 (1966) 343). Por- phyry himself wrote '071ptx&amp;a Tr.i'tara, the contents of which were primarily philological. It is not impossible, however, that longer Homeric !,r'l.xftac had made the move to a more complex structure, in a manner parallel to the Philonic development from Quaestiones to the more complex allegorical treatises (as postulated by Nikiprowetzky and Borgen &amp; Skarsten). 33 Note also that Numenius, as a notorious cptXoappppos, may have even read Philo's ex- egesis of the Pentateuch; cf. P6pin art cit. 270, Runia op.cit. (n.30) 51 n.86. 34 But note the appeal to the Homeric words vxixap ipuOp6v because ipu0p6v is the colour of honey (?16). This is reminiscent of Philo's associative methods. 35 Cf. the remarks of P. Borgen, 'Philo of Alexandria' in M. E.

Lauterbach, Mekilta de-Rabbi Ishmael (Philadelphia 1949) 1.1-15. 41 Compare 8.13-18 with Ebr.35! 42 Genesis Rabbah, translated by H. Freedman and M. Simon vol. 1 (London 1939) 220- 222, 230-232. 43 Parallels between Gen. 6:5 and Eccl. 2:21-23: 'man', 'heart', 'evil', 'all his days'. 44 Cf. Freedman &amp; Simon ad loc.: 'Heb. gezarah shawah. In reference to the Sodomites: 'Verily, the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great' (Gen. XVIII, 20). The analogy teaches that the punishment stated in the one case was also inflicted in the other'. The analogy is preserved in the LXX: 6:5 ir.OUv0-qacwxv, 18:20 xetXO0iuvTat. Philo apparently does not exploit it, even though he sees the two cosmic disasters as strictly parallel (Mos.2.54-57). 45 Philo clearly has Gen. 39:4, the same text as one of those used by the Rabbi, in mind at Deus 111, but combines it with Gen. 39:21. He confines his comparison to Pentateuchal figures (Noah, Moses, Joseph). 46 Note how Rabbi Abba b. Kahana (Gen.R. XXIX ?1, cf. XXVIII ?8) bases an inter- pretation on a complete disregard for punctuation, so that Gen. 6:7-8 reads 'for it repenteth that I have made them and Noah' (impossible in the Greek). Philo's procedure, again mutatis mutandis, at Deus 117 &amp; 122 is similar. 47 Cf. art.cit. (n.1) 239ff. and n.150 (which I now qualify). 48 Cf. Eusebius HE 2.18.4. 49 See above on Nikiprowetzky's analysis, and note also Radice Appendice B, Le origini del male 497. 50 Cazeaux too accepts the unit of the chapter as a working hypothesis; cf. La trame et la chaine 33. 51 See the table set out in Appendix 2. Only 6 of the chapters-Gig. 1-5, 6-18, 58-67, Deus 1-19, 122-139, 140-183-are unanimously recognized. 52 Taking into consideration only the undisputed chapters. Cazeaux in his analysis of Quis heres admits a chapter of 100 capita (?130-229); cf. op.cit. 267. 53 This is an expansion of suggestions made in art.cit. (n.1) 239. The reader will note a certain similarity with the 'patterns of elaboration' suggested by Mack in his two recent papers (e.g. rationale, contrast, analogy, example, witness, epilog). But my procedures are based on 'empirical' analysis of Philonic treatises rather than the codes of rhetorical systems. I also avoid the term 'elaboration'. 54 Two treatises 16. 55 On these in Philo cf. J. P6pin, 'Remarques sur la theorie de I'ex6egse allegorique chez Philon' in Philon d'Alexandrie, Lyon 11-15 Septembre 1966 (Paris 1967) 131-167, esp. 161ff. 56 Note that there is a difference between Philo and the Rabbis here, even though their method is very similar (cf. my remarks above on the gezerah shawa). Philo regards the verbal analogy as the result of the precision and accuracy of the divinely inspired lawgiver. The Rabbis, who do not confine the analogies to the books of Moses, must view the analogies more 'abstractly', as made possible by the God-given nature of scripture. 57 Two treatises 232. 58 Le origini del male 41-42, 44 (my translation). 137</page><page sequence="34">DAVID T.

Gig. 6-18 and Deus 33-47, which are primarily meant to furnish background information, could virtually come straight out of a philosophical textbook. 66 Some examples given at Runia op.cit.
