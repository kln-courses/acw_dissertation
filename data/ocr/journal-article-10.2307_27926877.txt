<plain_text><page sequence="1">Two Metal Figurines from Middle Bronze II Tel Yincam Harold A. Liebowitz The University of Texas at Austin Two metal figurines were found at Tel Yincam in the eastern Lower Galilee (Fig. I),1 on an isolated patch of an earth floor near the south-western corner of an apparent Middle Bronze Age II temple in Square Kll of Area (Fig. 2).2 The figurines, now in the Israel Museum, were discovered near one another in association with large sherds of a unique MB II jar with combed and rope decoration (see below), in which they may have been stored.3 The electrum figurine was found on the last day of the 1985 season, and the copper figurine and jar were uncovered in the 1986 season. Since there are relatively few examples of metal figurines from Middle Bronze Age Palestine,4 and none from the Lower Galilee, these figurines both augment the 1 For results of excavations at Tel Yincam, see E.M.

Photograph of electrum figurine (Fig. 3): courtesy of the Israel Museum, Jerusalem; photograph of copper figurine (Fig. 5): courtesy of the Israel Antiquities Authority. 2 Although little of this structure was excavated, the thickness of the walls (2 m.), recalling that of the MB temples at Hazor, Megiddo and Shechem, coupled with the discovery of these figurines, suggest that this was indeed a temple. 3 The storage of figurines in pottery vessels is known from Byblos, where the majority of the 25 figurine caches were found (cf. O. Negbi: Canaanite Gods in Metal, Tel Aviv, 1976, pp. 122-124; and references therein); from Ugarit (C. Schaeffer: Les fouilles de Minet-el Beida et de Ras Shamra, quatri?me campagne [printemps, 1932], rapport sommaire, Syria 14 [1933], pp. 124-126, Fig. 15); and from Nahariyah, where some of the metal figurines were also found in jars on the altar of the Square Temple (M. Dothan: The Excavations at Nahariyah, IEJ 6 [1956], p. 20; idem, Nahariya, in NEAEHL 3, Jerusalem, 1993, p. 1091). 4 Examples are known from Megiddo (G. Loud: Megiddo II: Seasons of 1935-39. Plates, Chicago, 1948, PL 233:1-15,17,18; PI. 234:16,19); from Nahariyah (I. Ben-Dor: A Middle Bronze Age Temple at Nahariyah, Israel, Department of Antiquities and Museums, QDAP 14 [1950], PL XII:6; Dothan [above, n. 3], P1.5:A-C, E-K, PL 6:A, B; and several unpublished examples: 3376, 4490, 54-193, 54-146, 860 and 1181); Beth Shemesh (D. Hansen: A Bronze in the Semitic Museum of Harvard University, BASOR 146 [1957], p. 14); and one unpublished example from Beth Shean (University Museum 32-15-323, Cabinet 26). Hence, the largest metal figurine assemblage from Palestine comes from Nahariyah. Tadmor correctly noted that these figurines are stylistically diverse and that none are iconographically identical, M.

LIEBOWITZ THE ELECTRUM FIGURINE (Fig. 3) Description The cast, mould-made figurine (IAA 85-275; Locus Kl 1.314) is complete, except for the upper part of the headdress. Total height: 5.75 cm.; height from the top of the headdress to the globular pedestal: 4.65 cm.; head width: 0.71 cm; shoulder width: 1.45 cm; pillar width: 0.5 cm. (at back), 0.3 cm. (at front); depth of pillar: 0.25 cm. (front to back), 0.4 cm. (near base). Colour: 2.5 Y 6/3, light yellowish-brown. Weight: 6.9 grams. hands are placed on the 'waist'. Thus, the shoulders, arms and upper part of the torso form a prominent, vertically bisected rectangle. The lower part of the torso and the vaguely differentiated tubular legs are represented by a slightly wider continuation of the pillar. The bulbous pedestal projects in front of the figurine, yet there is no attempt to represent feet. The upper part of the front of the pedestal is rough, but the rest of the pedestal is smooth. The back of the pillar is also almost perfectly flat, but rough in places. The figurine was apparently mould-made. This is suggested by the roughness of the edges along the left upper arm, the right elbow and the lower part of the pillar, where the metal extended beyond the depressed area of the open mould and was not filed away. Although the figurine appears to be female, its sex cannot be determined with certainty: there is no evidence either of Fig. 3. Electrum figurine. The head of the figurine is round and unarticulated, except for a dominating, slightly elongated, bulbous nose. A punctuated dot may perhaps represent the figurine's left eye, but in the absence of a cor responding punctuated dot on the right side of the figurine's head, it should not be considered anything but a flaw. Only the base of the thin, flat, narrow headdress was preserved. From the neck down, the figurine is rigidly geometric and stylised. The neck is thick-set and slightly elongated. The shoulders are square, forming right angles with the narrow, flattish pillar shaped torso, and the arms descend vertically at right angles to the shoulders, parallel to the torso. The arms turn in at a right angle at the 'elbows', and the unarticulated</page><page sequence="5">TWO METAL FIGURINES FROM MB II TEL YINeAM 59 breasts or of a pubic triangle.5 Nevertheless, its stance accords well with that of female figurines that support their breasts.6 Discussion In addition to the style (discussed below), the figurine is unique because of the use of electrum, a mixture of silver and gold, which is both a naturally occurring and a man-made alloy. Although objects made of electrum are known, the use of this material is relatively rare. Several electrum objects are known from Mesopotamia and Egypt,7 although, to the best of my knowledge, no figurines made of this alloy have yet been discovered in these regions. In Canaan, objects of electrum are less frequently found. Eight Chalcolithic ring-shaped circlets were found in the western Samaria Hills overlooking Nahal Qanah. While two of the circlets are of gold, the remaining six are of electrum, consisting of approximately 70% gold and 30% silver.8 The other known electrum objects from Canaan consist exclusively of jewellery items, such as from Tell el-Ajjul and Megiddo.9 In sum, the 5 Some figurines found elsewhere show clear evidence of gender. For example, the bronze figurine in the Montet jar, with his arm brought across his chest like the electrum figurine, is clearly a male, see P. Montet: Byblos et l'Egypte: Quatre campagnes de fouilles ? Gebeil 1921-1924, Paris, 1929, Pl. LXL400. Likewise, male genitalia are prominent on numerous figurines from Byblos published by Dunand, see H. Liebowitz: Regionalism in the Art of Syria and Palestine (unpublished Ph.D. diss., University of Pennsylvania), Pennsylvania, 1972, pp. 140-142 (Liebowitz Types VIA-VIE). 6 I wish to thank my graduate student Anne Dehnisch for this observation. 7 A small electrum head of a wolf, dating from the Uruk period, was found at Tepe Gawra, M.

LIEBOWITZ electrum figurine from Tel Yincam is the first such figurine to be found in the Middle East.10 The metal analysis of the figurine identified it as a silver-gold alloy with some copper. The metal was rather homogeneous, with an average composition of silver 72.76%, gold 20.16% and copper 6.83%.n Thus, while the object may be identified as electrum, its percentage of gold is relatively low. Various stylistic features of the Tel Yincam figurine recall features found among a variety of MB Syro-Palestinian figurine types, thereby identifying the figurine as coming from the Syro-Palestinian orbit.12 However, there is no true parallel from Syria and Lebanon that accords with the Tel Yincam figurine. The round contour of the head recalls three Syrian (?) figurines of unknown origin.13 However, their noses are far more prominent than that of the Tel Yincam figurine, as seen particularly in profile; in addition, the eyes of the former figurines are rendered as raised dotted circles, while the eyes on the Tel Yincam example are London, 1933, p. 8 and PL XIV; idem, Ancient Gaza IV, London, 1934, pp. 6, 9, and Pis. XIII, XIV:20-24; XXL209.1 wish to thank Anne Dehnisch for this reference. Electrum earrings are known from Megiddo Tombs 877B1 and 91 IB, P.L.O. Guy and R. Engberg: The Megiddo Tombs, Vol. 33, Chicago, 1938, Pis. 95:36; 119:10. While several silver figurines are known from Middle Bronze Age Nahariyah (see Ben-Dor [above, n. 4], PL XIL5; Dothan [above, n. 3], Pis. 4,5:C, E-G, J, K; and a number of unpublished examples: Israel Department of Antiquities and Museums 54-193; 54-146; 55-441), there are no known examples of electrum figurines from that site or elsewhere in Canaan. As far as I know, the figurines from Nahariyah have not been chemically analysed ? or, at least, their chemical composition has not been published. In perhaps the latest reference to this assemblage as a whole, Tadmor (above, n. 4), p. 164, was able to report only that '...at Nahariyah, over 20 female figurines, mostly made of silver, were found...'. 10 Of the 30 anthropomorphic figurines whose chemical analysis was published by P. Moorey and S. Fleming (Problems in the Study of the Anthropomorphic Metal Statuary from Syro-Palestine before 330 B.C., Levant 16 [1984], pp. 83-88), all but one consist primarily of copper and bronze. Only one is silver, and not a single example contains any gold. 11 Thanks are extended to Vitaly Gutkin, manager of the Electron Probe Laboratory in Jerusalem, for his analysis of these figurines. Both were analysed by means of the X-ray microanalyses method on the JEOL JXA-8600 Electron Microprobe by energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry and ZAF correction procedure. The analysis was done with 15.0 KeV acceleration voltage, 10.0 nA probe current, bean focused to 1.0 urn. 12 Hansen (above, n. 4) and Negbi (above, n. 3) have proposed different typologies for the bewildering range of MB metal figurines. Subsequently, Moorey and Fleming (above, n. 10) reviewed the broad chronological range of anthropomorphic metal figurines. The scope of this paper does not permit a broader discussion (see Liebowitz, above, n. 5). 13 1) M. Vieyra: Hittite Art: 2300-750 B.C., London, 1955, No. 115; Negbi (above, n. 3), Fig. 69:1500; 2) A.

The relatively elongated neck of the Tel Yincam figurine on the one hand recalls far too many Syrian figurines to cite, suggesting a general MB Syro-Palestinian setting for the Tel Yincam example, but on the other hand is less exaggerated than that of the Syrian counterparts. While the treatment of the upper arms, at right angles to the broad horizontal shoulders, on a silver figurine from Ugarit,14 accords with that of the arms on the figurine from Tel Yincam, the forearms on the Ugarit specimen are bent at the elbows and extend in front of the figure, rather than turning in to the waist, as in our example. The use of a narrow pillar to represent the torso and legs is paralleled on the same figurine from Ugarit, but there, the pillar is wide in the torso area and relatively wide in the region of the legs, and has a projection representing partially articulated feet. The globular pedestal on which the Tel Yincam figurine stands occurs in several figurines; this feature, however, is of too general and functional a character to be stylistically significant. The figurine somewhat more closely parallels a 7 cm. tall silver figurine from a Middle Bronze Age IIB temple at Nahariyah15 and a similar bronze figurine from Hazor,16 which differ from one another primarily in the shape of the headdress ? which is trapezoidal with a pointed projection at the top in the Nahariyah example and bullet shaped in the Hazor example ? and in the presence of an incised pubic triangle in the specimen from Hazor. These figurines correspond stylistically with the Tel Yincam figurine in a number of aspects: the right-angled treatment of the shoulders; the way the forearms bend at the 'elbows' and the hands are brought to the torso; the relative narrowness of the chest; and the opening between upper arm and torso. The chest of the Nahariyah and Hazor figurines, however, is somewhat more articulated, with the presence of small button breasts, and the inner contour formed by the torso and shoulders is rounded, giving the sense of a broader chest. Moreover, the Nahariyah and Hazor figurines have a distinct waist and two adjoining, yet articulated legs descending from relatively wide hips. Thus, while the Nahariyah and Hazor figurines may be considered the closest parallels to the Yincam specimen, they are not true parallels either. Nevertheless, the similarity of the Tel Yincam specimen to the Nahariyah and Hazor figurines, as opposed to examples from elsewhere in the Syro-Palestinian orbit (either north or south), suggests that the figurine under discussion was made somewhere in northern Israel. The discovery of a stone mould, with traces of metal still adhering to it, on the floor of a bamah at Nahariyah supports local production of figurines at that site.17 However, since the stylistic disparity between the Tel 14 Schaeffer (above, . 3), Pl.

LIEBOWITZ Yincam figurine and its closest parallels is beyond the normal range of stylistic deviation, the Tel Yincam figurine may have come from an as yet unidentified workshop somewhere in northern Israel. The possibility that this workshop was at Tel Yincam itself is not to be ruled out, since only a small part of the site has been excavated so far. Regarding the date of the Tel Yincam figurine, the stratigraphie context is limited by the presence of only a single, unparalleled jar in the locus where the figurine was found. The jar (AK 110657; Locus K11.312; outer rim diameter: 21.2 cm.; section colour: 10 YR 7/4; Fig. 4), is very pale brown, with large and small white grit, small black grit and some reddish-brown grains. It is badly attested on one vessel at Byblos,18 there are, to my knowledge, no examples combining all the features evident in Fig. 4. Moreover, combed decorations combining both parallel horizontal incisions and vertical wavy lines is unknown. Elsewhere, in unstratified contexts at Tel Yincam, both MB IIA and MB IIB sherds were found. The resemblance to the Nahariyah and Hazor figurines, on the other hand, supports a Late MB IIB date. Description The partially corroded flat figurine (IAA 86-807; Locus Kl 1.314) is 5.25 cm. high, and 1.8 cm. wide at the shoulders and the elbows. The width is 0.5 cm. at the widest point of the chest, and 0.6 cm. at the figure's waist. The head, set on a relatively thick neck, tilts to its left. In its present state, the face has little definition, although the nose projects slightly. The figurine apparently had a headdress, not preserved. The figurine has broad, square, slightly drooping shoulders and a narrow serpentine torso, both features possibly being a function of the corrosion process, which apparently distorted the original, possibly Fig. 4. MB II jar with rope decoration. spalled on the exterior. It has groups of irregular vertically incised decoration between horizontally-incised decoration above and impressed rope decoration below. While examples of jars with combed horizontal parallel lines, combed parallel wavy lines, or rope decorations are well known, and rope decoration and painted decoration are THE COPPER FIGURINE (Fig. 5) 18 M. Dunand: Fouilles de Byblos 1926-1932,1, Paris, 1939, p. 234.</page><page sequence="9">TWO METAL FIGURINES FROM MB II TEL YIINTAM 63 Fig. 5. Copper figurine. more symmetrical treatment of the torso. The left shoulder is rounded as it joins the upper arm, but this too is probably due to corrosion. Both arms hang vertically and are bent at the elbow. While the figurine's right forearm is placed horizontally across the torso, the figurine's left 'hand' is slightly raised. The relatively thick-set, short legs are separated and the figurine's left leg is bowed. They are, however, not articulated, and the feet are not rendered. The back of the figurine is flat, though with some small cavities. The sex of this figurine, like that of the electrum figurine, cannot be determined with certainty, although it too is apparently female. Discussion This figurine consists of pure copper with some amount of arsenic,19 but no zinc. Three composition zones were identified: 1) arsenic-copper background (Cu 99.53%, As 0.47%); 2) pure copper zones (Cu 100%); and 3) small (approximately 1-2 urn.) Pb-Cu-Ag-As grains with an average composition of Pb 62.48%, Cu 33.12%, As 2.71%, Ag 1.69%.20 For electron microscope images of this sample, see Fig. 6. As a figure made of practically pure copper, this object is unusual. The only other Middle Eastern figurines close to it in chemical composition are an Early Bronze Ill-Middle Bronze I figurine of a standing woman, purchased in Aleppo, which consists of 99% copper, and two joined Middle Bronze I- A figurines, consisting of 98.3% copper, also bought in Aleppo.21 However, no conclusions concerning the origin of the Tel Yincam figurine can be drawn from this chemical analysis. While the treatment of the arms recalls that of the electrum figurine, that of the legs is distinctly different: it represents a variant tradition with superficial 19 The analysis, like that of the electrum figurine, was carried out by Vitaly Gutkin. See above, n. 11 for information about the laboratory and technology of the metal analysis. The presence of arsenic on copper is probably connected to the source sulfide ore that can contain some small amount of arsenic in copper or Cu-As sulfide minerals, like tennantite (Cu,FE)12As4 Si3, enargute Cu3 AsS4, arsenopyrute FeAsS. 20 Written communication: V Gutkin (5 July 1998). 21 Moorey and Fleming (above, n. 10), p. 83, Nos. 1, 5.</page><page sequence="10">64 HAROLD A. LIEBOWITZ Fig. 6. Electron microscopic image of sample from copper figurine. affinities to the treatment of separated legs of numerous figurines from Byblos.22 However, although figurines with separated legs abound at Byblos, these figurines are normally in a striding position with the left leg forward.23 The arms of the Byblos figurines differ: they consistently hang vertically, usually away from the body, are not bent at the elbow, and the hands are not placed on the waist. Moreover, these figurines display greater articulation:24 some hold weapons in their clenched fists, with their arms bent at the elbows, projecting forward. The treatment of the arms and the flatness of the copper figurine from Tel Yincam generally accord with these features in the electrum figurine discussed above and the figurines from Nahariyah and Hazor, although the copper figurine ? like the electrum figurine ? has no true parallel.25 22 Dunand (above, . 18), Pis.

Stepanski: Survey Map of Rosh Pinah: 1992, Hadashot Arkheologiyot [1994], Fig. 13, H12 [Hebrew]) is closer in spirit to the MB II figurines from Byblos than to the example from Tel Yincam.</page><page sequence="11">TWO METAL FIGURINES FROM MB II TEL A 65 There is insufficient data to date this copper figurine with any precision. Nevertheless, like the electrum figurine, it should be dated to the latter part of the Middle Bronze Age, since it was found with the former, and there is no compelling evidence to suggest that it is an heirloom. CONCLUSIONS Although the Tel Yincam figurines represent two different types, they both correspond more closely to figurines from Nahariyah than with figurines from Syria and Lebanon. Notwithstanding this, they diverge sufficiently from these parallels as to be considered unique. While there is no evidence for local production of these figurines, apoint of origin somewhere in northern Israel can be posited for both examples. In terms of date, the form and general style of the decoration of the jar found in association with the figurines generally recall Middle Bronze Age jars in Palestine, though I know of no close parallels26 that could be drawn upon to date this isolated locus. Moreover, as Middle Bronze Age cooking pots from other MB II loci at Tel Yincam have close MB IIA and MB IIB/C parallels, the precise date of the locus in which these figurines were found is in doubt. Since the figurines generally accord with MB IIB figurines at Nahariyah and Hazor, a MB IIB date is suggested for the figurines, which may have been locally made. While these figurines, like other similar metal and pottery specimens, apparently had ritual significance, their precise function remains enigmatic. All one can note with assurance is that they do not hold weapons and are therefore not associated with gods of war. It is also more likely that they represent female deities then male deities. However, any attempt to identify these disparate figurines with a particular deity is risky.27 26 The closest parallel is to a foundation-deposit jar at Byblos, Montet (above, n. 5), PL LX:394. 27 The fruitlessness of such an attempt has been briefly spelled out by Moorey and Fleming (above, n. 10), pp. 80, 81.</page></plain_text>
