Oil, 51 x 36 cm (20 x 14 in.). The Farber Collection, New York Shortly after its inception in Paris, cub- ism first appeared in the United States in 1909 with Max Weber's fledgling mod- ernist work, a result of the artist's brief friendship the year before with Pablo Picasso. Weber met Picasso at one of the celebrated soirees that collector Leo Stein and his sister, Gertrude, hosted in Paris. Weber visited the young Spaniard's studio and was influenced by the work he saw there. Despite limited financial resources, he bought a small Cezanne- inspired still life by Picasso and brought it with him to New York. While Picasso's legendary instigation and exploration of cubism with his French co-creator Georges Braque has been celebrated and extensively documented, much less atten- tion has been devoted to Weber's impres- sive early cubist experimentation and the significance of his interaction with Picasso. On his return to New York in January of 1909, after spending over three years in Paris, the twenty-eight-year-old Weber embarked on a decade of creativity that established him as America's greatest cub- ist painter and proved to be the most sig- nificant years of his career. He was the first artist to exhibit protocubist paintings in the United States in the 1910 Younger American Painters exhibition at Alfred Stieglitz's legendary gallery at 291 Fifth Avenue, called "291," and the first to have his new experimental work pub- lished in the American press that same year. Influenced by the innovative, formal strategies of Picasso, Matisse, and Cezanne, Weber at first applied these innovations to traditional French cubist themes of nudes, still lifes, and land- scapes. Later, he extended his range of subjects to include vaudeville and New York and helped redefine the stylistic and thematic boundaries of American art. His urban paintings Chinese Restaurant (1915; fig. 1), Rush Hour, New York (1915; fig. 2), Grand Central Terminal, and New York Department Store are considered masterpieces of American cubism. Although Weber's influence was less global than Picasso's, both men changed the course of twentieth-century art through their cubist explorations. This article examines the nature of their friendship, its influence on Weber's early cubist paintings, and the introduction of cubism to Americans.1 Paris Intersections A naturalized American citizen, Max Weber (1881-1961) had been born in Bialystok, Russia, just six months before Pablo Picasso was born in Malaga, Spain. 59 American Art</page><page sequence="3">Weber arrived in Paris on September 25, 1905, at the age of twenty-four, just in time to witness the debut of fauvism at the third annual Salon d'Automne that opened on October 18. He settled in Montparnasse, where he remained until he left for America in late 1908. Picasso had arrived in Paris from Barcelona in 1900 for the first of several visits. In 1904 "Lengthy ... discussions on the most recent developments and trends in art took place, with Leo as moderator andpontiff Here one feltfree to throw artistic atom bombs and many cerebral explosions did take place. " -Max Weber he established a permanent base on a quiet corner of the butte of Montmartre, where he resided until 1909 at a studio referred to as the Bateau-Lavoir, because the shape of the building resembled a laundry barge.2 Although Weber and Picasso were both struggling young artists, their situa- tions in Paris in 1905 were markedly dis- similar. Picasso had been a child prodigy, whose family had fostered his genius. Al- though he was living in poverty in his early Paris years, Picasso was already reaching a mature phase in his career and had produced an impressive body of work. Weber, on the other hand, had come from an Orthodox Jewish family that did not encourage his artistic talents. Even though he had earned a teaching degree from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and had taught drawing and manual training at the high school and college level for four years, Weber considered himself a student. He registered for classes at the Academie Julian on October 9, 1905. The small art school on the left bank of the Seine had been a haven for American impressionist painters during the 1890s. The Academie Julian contin- ued to attract numerous foreign students, who were ineligible to study at the presti- gious Ecole des Beaux-Arts. Leo Stein, with whom Weber would share a passion- ate interest in Cezanne, had entered the Academie Julian in 1903. Weber's profes- sor, Jean-Paul Laurens, a master of narra- tive painting, whose most impressive works could be seen in the Parisian Pantheon, insisted on detailed drawing as the underpinning of all painting. Since Weber had studied in the United States with the more progressive Arthur Wesley Dow at Pratt, he was antagonistic to what he perceived to be the outmoded refine- ment of academic discipline. He aban- doned his studies at the Academie Julian in February 1906 to draw without cri- tique at the academies of Colarossi and La Grande Chaumiere in Montparnasse.3 When Weber was not drawing or painting, he visited the city's many muse- ums so that he became well versed in the entire history and range of world art. He was especially attracted to Asian art (which Dow had shown him) and fre- quented the Musee Guimet. Weber dis- covered African and Pre-Columbian art at the Musee d'Ethnographie du Trocadero, now the Musee de l'Homme, and at- tended exhibitions at galleries of ancient as well as contemporary art. Weber was eager to improve his skills and searched for progressive instruction. In January 1908, he was among a group of students who encouraged Matisse, the star of the fauve salon he had seen, to critique their paintings. Weber wrote to his friend the American painter Abraham Walkowitz about his helping to organize the class along with Leo Stein and his 60 Fall 2000</page><page sequence="4">sister-in-law, Sarah Stein. Although the school started in the Couvent des Oiseaux on the rue de Sevres, Matisse was forced to move to the Couvent du Sacre Coeur on the Boulevard des Invalides during the spring. The grand eighteenth-century hotelparticulier, which had been a con- vent during the nineteenth century, had expansive rooms suitable for studios with large windows that faced a beautiful gar- den. The French government allowed artists to use spaces in abandoned con- vents without leases, so that they could be put out without warning when a suitable use was determined for the buildings.4 In The Autobiography ofAlice B. Toklas (1933), Gertrude Stein's memoir that documents her catalytic association with the movers and shakers of the art world during the early twentieth century, she relates an anecdote about the Matisse class: There were quite a number ofamericans. One of these americans under a plea ofpov- erty was receiving his tuition for nothing and then wasfound to have purchasedfor himselfa tiny Matisse and a tiny Picasso and a tiny Seurat. This was not only unfair, because many of the others wanted and could not afford to own a picture by the master and they were paying their tuition, but, since he also bought a Picasso, it was treason. This description may well refer to Weber, although he did not purchase the Picasso Still Life until the autumn of 1908, after he had left the Matisse class. Weber was later pleased to relate that Gertrude Stein told him that Matisse had said, "He's the most interesting youth for me in Paris."5 Gertrude Stein does not mention Weber by name in her Autobiography. However, Weber's friend the expatriate American photographer Alvin Langdon Coburn mentioned him in a letter to her on April 30, 1913. As late as 1919, she referred to Weber in a letter to Picasso describing events associated with an exhi- bition of American art at the Musee du Luxembourg. While there is no evidence that Weber ever purchased a painting by Seurat, he acquired small works by Matisse and Picasso, and she may easily have forgotten the specifics of the inci- dent after so many years.6 Weber was closer to Leo Stein than to his sister, Gertrude (fig. 3). The siblings had lived together at 27 rue de Fleurus since 1903. Much later Weber remem- bered the celebrated soirees: Leo and Gertrude Stein graciously received art students, students ofphilosophy and lan- guages at the Sorbonne; writers, youngpo- ets, musicians, and scientists who came to study the paintings of Cezanne and those of the other rising artists. For hours they stood around a large table in the center of the room, examiningportfolios full of drawings by Matisse, Picasso, and others, andfolios stocked with superb Japaneseprints. This salon was a sort of intellectual clearing house of ideas and matters of art, for the young and aspiring artists from all over the world. Lengthy and involved discussions on the most recent developments and trends in art took place, with Leo as moderator and pontiff Here onefeltfree to throw artistic atom bombs and many cerebral explosions did take place.7 Gertrude and Leo's brother, Michael, and his wife, Sarah, also held open house on Saturday evenings, at 58 rue Madame, around the corner from the younger Steins, and the participants could move easily from one residence to the other. These evenings enabled Weber and other art students to examine the Stein families' notable collections of paintings by cutting-edge artists, including Picasso, whose work Leo and Gertrude Stein had collected since 1905. Weber probably met Picasso at Leo 61 American Art</page><page sequence="5">1 Max Weber, Chinese Restaurant, 1915. Oil, 101.6 x 122 cm (40 x 48 in.).

The two small young men with penetrating gazes shared interests in Cezanne (who would increas- ingly inspire innovative directions for both artists), El Greco, African tribal art, Japa- nese prints, and ancient artifacts. They may have discussed El Greco's work, since the sixth Salon d'Automne that year included a retrospective exhibition of his art.8 And both men intensely wanted to make important, challenging art. Weber exhibited seven works in the Salon d'Automne, which were selected by a jury that Matisse and his friends dominated. Picasso, on the other hand, did not participate in large public exhibi- tions, but saw every Independants and Salon d'Automne exhibition up to World War One.

Detail of photo from Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University the two artists' brief but consequential relationship. Weber did not speak French on his arrival in Paris and learned the ru- diments of the language with the aid of a dictionary. In typical French fashion, they addressed each other formally. Curiously, Weber used the English form of address, "Mr. Picasso," perhaps considering it to be an abbreviation for "monsieur." In a letter dated October 25, 1908, he wrote: Cher Mr. Picasso: Je serai chez vous cet semaine pour apprendre mon petite nature morte qui vous avez regarde pour moi depuis trois semaine. Je suis certain quejaurai I'argent cet semaine. Je vous assure queje serai tres heureux de la voir. Avec beaucoup d'appreciation et estime.

I assure you that I will be very happy to see it. With much appreciation and esteem. Sincerely yours, Max Weber, 7 rue Belloni. I saw your landscapes and still life last night at Leo Stein s. They are truly superb) The picture Weber referred to is presum- ably the virtually unknown, hitherto un- published Still Life (fig. 4) that remains in the collection of the artist's family. Similar to several other still lifes by Picasso from 1908, it depicts a covered jar, a sphere (perhaps an apple), a curved shape (possibly a cucumber), and a faceted pear.9 Weber had been producing still lifes based on Cezanne's shifting perspectives since he saw the commemorative Cezanne retrospective in 1907 at the Salon d'Automne. Picasso's work may have reinforced Weber's exploration of the genre. In the manner of his friend's Still Life, Weber created numerous small still-life compositions in a restricted pal- ette using foreground placement of geo- metric shapes to investigate formal relationships. Picasso's only extant message to Weber is postmarked November 10, 1908. Since Picasso was not at home on at least one occasion when Weber appeared at his stu- dio, he may not have acquired the "little still life" until November.

Yours truly, Picasso.)10 When Weber visited Picasso that au- tumn, Les Demoiselles dAvignon (fig. 5), his landmark painting finished the previ- ous year, would have been a prominent fixture in his Bateau-Lavoir studio. Weber also would have seen the monu- mental canvas of Three Women (1908), which would later influence his crystal figures. Weber recalled that Picasso vis- ited his studio at 7 rue Belloni, where he was working on a painting called Summer (fig. 6). 11 Weber probably began Summer in Paris and completed it in the United States. Similar to Matisse's arcadian fauve paint- ings in its erotic subject, lively color, and heavy impasto, it shows three langorous female nudes relaxing en plein air.

Weber's sumptuous greenery in Summer evokes Henri Rousseau's jungle foliage. Rousseau was Weber's closest friend in Paris. For tree canopy, Weber used "petites cubes," revealing his incipient interest in cubism as a new way to construct pictorial space. As a whole, Summer displays his assimila- tion of a variety of strategies into an im- pressive personal style. Weber claims to have introduced Picasso to Rousseau and first brought Picasso to Rousseau's studio. Even so, Weber did not attend (presumably he was not invited, since he was in Paris at the time) the banquet that Picasso held in late November to honor the much older artist. Weber may have been too serious for the lively crew who staged the event.12 On December 19, Rousseau held a farewell musical soiree for Weber who planned to leave Paris for the States. Picasso and his companion Fernande Olivier, as well as Apollinaire and Marie Laurencin were among the twenty-five guests at the musical "Soiree Donnee en l'Honneur des Adieux de M. Weber"at which Weber sang. Two days later, Weber left Paris on the boat-train for England on his way to the United States.

Weber sent Picasso a postcard of an Assyrian lamassu in the British Museum ("Winged Figure and Winged Human Headed Bull from Doorway, Khorsabad"). Although diffi- cult to decipher, the postmark appears to be December 28, 1908. The card reveals his interest in ancient art, which would soon influence his work. Weber wrote: Cher Mr. Picasso: Je regret beaucoup que; j'eu ne suis pas alee chez vous, pour vous voir autantpartir, mais j'espere que vous verez bien toi. Mes sincere salutations et beaucoup beaucoup du success. Max Weber Des choses Congo au museum British sont numerous et superbe J'espere que vous leur verez bientot.

The Congo things at the British Museum are numerous and superb and I hope thatyou will see them soon.) The card is the last direct communication between them. Rousseau, who addressed Weber as "dear friend," however, passed on greetings from "Pikasso" [sic] to Weber in a letter from Paris, dated March 20, 1909. Weber clearly anticipated Picasso's "beaucoup, beaucoup" success, but he might not have been pleased if he had realized that he would be so over- shadowed by it.'4 Return to America Despite his limited financial means, Weber returned to the United States in January 1909 with examples of the most advanced European art. In addition to the Picasso Still Life, Weber had acquired four paintings and two drawings by Rousseau, who also gave him a small painted vase, an inscribed photograph of himself in his studio, and his walking stick; photographic reproductions by Eugene Druet of works by Matisse, Gauguin, and Cezanne; three lithographs by Toulouse-Lautrec; a collection of Dutch and Japanese prints; two small African statuettes; and a ceramic tile Matisse painted in 1907 with a replica of his celebrated painting Blue Nude (Souvenir ofBiskra) (fig. 7).15 Weber was eager to demonstrate the lessons that he had learned in Europe. In the spring of 1909 he organized an exhibition of his work at the framing 68 Fall 2000</page><page sequence="12">8 Max Weber, Vaudeville, 1909. Oil, 51 x 36 cm (20 x 14 in.). The Farber Collection, New York shop of Julius G. Haas at 648 Madison Avenue in New York. If, as is likely, Weber exhibited his painting Summer at the Haas Gallery, it would have been the earliest painting with cubist elements ex- hibited in the United States. The two cursory reviews of the show were less than enthusiastic, but they indicate that Weber's style appeared unusual to American viewers. At least the critics were not yet overtly hostile. A review in the New York Morning Sun noted, "He has studied Paul Cezanne, as his fruit, flower and other still life testifies; also the nudes which shock the eyes at first glance ... Henri Matisse has been his model, perhaps idol." The shocking nudes may have included the three women in Summer, as well as a figure study that was probably one of the nudes that Weber painted in Matisse's class. Other figure drawings may also have shocked the reviewer. The critic for the American Art News thought his Adam and Eve (unlocated) was "somewhat primitive in conception and execution."16 Weber's remarkable pictures, how- ever, attracted the attention of the sophis- ticated artist and connoisseur Arthur B. Davies, who would be the organizing force behind the 1913 Armory Show, which exposed Americans to the breadth of modern art. Davies purchased two uni- dentified paintings. The sale initiated a supportive friendship and provided Weber with the funds to rent a barn (or possibly a boathouse) at College Point on Long Island for the summer, where he explored the new art forms that he had encountered in Paris. The most intriguing works that Weber produced that summer were a series of paintings of performers with strange fig- ural distortions-harbingers of cubism. The subject of performance had intrigued Weber since his early days in Paris, when he had studied singing in addition to painting. He had made a number of sketches in Parisian cabarets dating from 1906 that paid homage to works by Toulouse-Lautrec, as did early Parisian works by Picasso. Weber said in an interview in 1958 that a drawing (unlo- cated) executed in Paris of a singer per- forming Bach's Coffee Cantata was his first cubist work.17 Among Weber's performance pictures are scenes from vaudeville that probably 69 American Art</page><page sequence="13">9 New York World, April 3, 1910, Sunday April Fool's edition, p. 2M.

In the same interview Weber recalled that he had seen a burlesque at Coney Island that summer, but he may have confused burlesque with vaudeville, since Coney Island was the site of a seaside vaudeville theater. By the mid-1880s, vaudeville (from the French voix de ville, or voices of the city) dominated popular theatrical entertainment in New York. Awkward and curious, his painting Vaudeville, later renamed Burlesque II (frontispiece; fig. 8), presents two music hall dancers as if they were dolls, with their arms attached back- wards and a disembodied head resting on a stage at the lower left corner of the painting. It was probably the painting listed in the brochure for Weber's 1911 retrospective at 291.18 Probably Weber's initial experiment in cubist analysis, Vaudeville presents dancers whose planar structure and reconfigured anatomy mimic the nudes in Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. Weber, however, did not appropriate the gro- tesque, masklike faces that make the Demoiselles so horrifying, but instead chose facial stylizations based on the Etruscan sculptures that he had seen in Italy. Despite his attraction to Picasso's method, throughout 1909 Weber ad- hered to Matisse's use of rough textures and brilliant complementary colors. Thus, Weber combined the structural analysis of cubism and the riotous colors of fauvism with aspects of ancient art to produce a distinctive style. In addition, Weber chose a particularly American subject for Vaudeville. As vaudevillian Edwin Milton Royle noted in an 1899 article, "Vaudeville theatre is an American invention.... The vaude- ville theatre belongs to the era of the department store and the short story. It may be a kind of lunch counter art, but then art is so vague and lunch is so real." While performance had been a popular subject for painters since the 1880s, ap- pearing prominently in Picasso's series of circus performers from 1905-1906, vaudeville was an especially American form of popular entertainment. Also, the stars and stripes in Vaudeville an- nounce his intent to create a specifically American art. Spring Song (fig. 9), later titled Bur- lesque, is a more complex composition than the earlier Vaudeville. It is probably based on Isadora Duncan's interpretation 70 Fall2000</page><page sequence="14">I</page><page sequence="15">of Mendelssohn's fluttery melody during her New York concerts in the fall of 1909, rather than on vaudeville or bur- lesque shows. While it also recalls the flattened forms, stylized features, and anatomical dislocations of Les Demoiselles dAvignon, it is more colloquial, less allegorical, smaller in scale, and more dynamic than Picasso's grand bordello Weber's writhingfemale nudes suggest the generative and animate nature of all lifeforms even at the cellular level. In these studies he seems to search for the anthropomorphic equivalent to atomic theory. picture. Although three separate dancers (or pieces of them) are depicted, they are probably intended to represent a single dancer moving across the stage. Even in this early cubist-influenced work, Weber extended Picasso's formalist ideas to in- clude dynamic movement.19 Spring Song was the most unusual painting exhibited in the 1910 pivotal exhibition introducing the work of nine Younger American Painters at 291. After the exhibition closed, it was singled out for mockery in the Sunday April Fool's edition of the New York Morning World: "Max's study of a lady with four hands and the prickly heat, with her younger sister in a petticoat and a pink corset in- terpreting the Spring Song in the middle distance. It's a scream." The remarks shed light on the derision that greeted Weber's early interpretation of the lessons of Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. As the first clearly protocubist painting exhibited in America, it is not surprising that Spring Song was incomprehensible to critics who were scarcely cognizant of the revolution in European art, which had been growing since the 1880s.20 Despite numerous references to Matisse in the commentary on the 1910 exhibition, one perceptive critic noted, "Many of the most promising of the young Americans have followed one or the other [Cezanne or Matisse] directly, and also have followed Picasso, to whom nature is a series of geometrical designs that are to be insisted upon in reproduc- tion at the expense of the anatomical con- struction, as one may see in the drawings of Max Weber." In his search to forge a personal style, Weber, at this point, how- ever, owed debts to all three of the artists mentioned in the review.21 American artist Gelette Burgess's influential article, "The Wild Men of Paris," published in the Architectural Record in May 1910, described and illus- trated work by Matisse, Picasso, Braque, and other artists whom Burgess had inter- viewed in Paris in 1908. This was the first publication of protocubist French paint- ings in the United States, although it fol- lowed the illustration of Weber's Spring Song in the New York press by one month. Picasso's painting Three Women, which was illustrated in the article, influ- enced Weber's crystal figures.22 Weber's sophisticated crystal figures of 1910-11 (fig. 10) demonstrate a more cohesive response to cubist theory than his performance pictures. To distance his work from that of his Parisian contempo- raries, he adopted a scientific term to de- scribe his stylistic experimentation and used a blue crystalline tone, along with the beige and gray of analytical cubist paintings. Weber's writhing female nudes suggest the generative and animate nature of all life forms even at the cellular level. In these studies he seems to search for the anthropomorphic equivalent to atomic theory. The crystal figures, rendered with 72 Fall 2000</page><page sequence="16">Cezannesque directional brush strokes and blocky forms, are more sculptural than the performance pictures. Weber traded the earlier brilliant hues for more muted tones in his elemental interpreta- tion of these female figures, creating more cohesive and unified compositions in which there is no dear foreground, middle ground, and background. Thus, the crys- tal figures are more integrated and fully developed cubist images. The commentary on Weber's retro- spective exhibition (which included his crystal figures) at 291 in January 1911, published by Alfred Stieglitz in Camera Work, explains his method: Form, with him, is not the reproduction on canvas of the imageformed on the retina. It is analyzed into its constituent parts, its bulk is emphasized, the relation- ship of lines and masses is explained. Mr. Weber shows that he possesses thoroughly the technique of drawing and painting. His compositions are logical andforceful, his mind is creative, his color is pleasing-and yet his work worries one. It appeals so much to the mind that it challenges criticism, and one cannot quite relax infront of it. This show was a preparation and an introduc- tion to the work ofPaul Cezanne and of Pablo Picasso, whichfollowed respectively in March and April.23 Traditional critics were slow to under- stand the value of this new type of paint- ing, and Weber remembered their vituperative attacks throughout his life. In a review of his retrospective exhibition at 291, the New York Globe said, "The more the work is strange, crude, awk- ward, appalling, evidently the more it is in favor with him .... Here are travesties of the human form."24 The notion that these "travesties" of the human form represented a new way of thinking about painting that was conceptual rather than photographic was as unfathomable to most critics as it was for ordinary Americans whose ideas about art were rooted in the nineteenth century. While Weber helped to lead American art out of the nineteenth century and into the twentieth, he was quickly overshadowed by his friend Picasso. Unfavorable com- parisons with the Spanish-born artist that began with Weber's 291 exhibition would haunt him throughout his career and even continue to the present. Yet Weber was instrumental in insti- gating an exhibition of Picasso's drawings and watercolors at 291, which opened on March 28, 1911, two months after the close of his own show. Weber's friendship with Picasso and his passionate belief in his art persuaded Stieglitz to show Picasso's radical work. Picasso's American debut of eighty-three drawings and water- colors was neither a critical nor a financial success. Only one drawing was sold, but the show celebrated Picasso as the origi- nator of a challenging new style.25 Critics have subsequently referred to Weber's cubist imagery as derivative and dismissed his early work as a feeble imita- tion. Yet Weber's cubist paintings bear his personal signature in their attention to contemporary American subjects rather than the traditional genres the French cubists favored. His series of urban images from the 1910s, for ex- ample, Chinese Restaurant (see fig. 1) and Rush Hour, New York (see fig. 2), capture the dynamic essence of the modern city. In Interior of the Fourth Dimension (fig. 11) he invigorates cubist forms with futurist force lines.26 Moreover, Weber's extensive exhibition of these works during the second decade of the twentieth cen- tury reinforced the significance of this revolutionary new mode of pictorial construction. In contrast to the cerebral pleasures of French cubism, Weber's cub- ist paintings generate emotional exhilara- tion through an inventive language of visual form. 73 American Art</page><page sequence="17">11 Max Weber, Interior of the Fourth Dimension, 1913.

Miller and in honor of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the National Gallery of Art After momentous events during the second decade of the century, including World War One, Weber's marriage in 1916, and the deaths of his parents in 1917 and 1918, his art became more lyrical and romantic and lost its edge. By 1920, Weber had abandoned cubism, as had Picasso shortly thereafter. Despite Weber's struggle with critics during his cubist decade, his reputation soared during the 1930s and 1940s in response to his Cezanne-based still-life and expressionist figure compositions. He was awarded prizes and honors, such as the accolade of being the first American artist to have a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in 1930. During that decade, his leadership in modern art was confirmed when he was chosen to direct the national, politically active American Artist's Congress.27 Although Weber's later expressionist paintings made an indelible imprint on American art, his introduction of cubism to America following his associa- tion with Picasso and his dramatic American cubist paintings are his most important legacy. 74 Fall 2000</page><page sequence="18">Notes With many thanks to Joy Weber for her incomparable long-standing assistance and to Katherine Manthorne and Barbara Wolanin for their suggestions. 1 This article represents a rethinking of ideas originally presented in my essay "Max Weber: The Cubist Decade" in Max Weber: The Cubist Decade 1910- 1920, the catalogue for a Weber exhibition at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, published by the High Museum in 1991. 2 Weber arrived in Paris on the Red Star Line ship Krumland. He rented a studio at 9 rue Campagne Premiere in Montparnasse, a building of artists' studios that has become a Parisian landmark. He moved several times during his residence in Paris, but remained in Montparnasse. The art historian John Richardson relates that Louis Vauxcelles, the critic who coined the term "Les Fauves" in a review of the 1905 Salon d'Automne to describe the wild colorism of paintings by Matisse and his friends, also introduced the term "cubism" in a review of Georges Braque's exhibition at the Kahnweiler Gallery in 1908; see Richardson, A Life of Picasso 1907-1917: The Painter of Modern Life, vol. 2 (New York: Random House, 1996), p. 101. 3 Both of these small ateliers were on the rue de la Grande Chaumiere in Montparnasse. Established in 1904, the year before Weber's arrival in Paris, La Grande Chaumiere is still a flourish- ing art school, as is the Academie Julian, on the rue de Dragon, but the Academie Colarossi no longer exists. Matisse drew from the model at the open Academie de la Grande Chaumiere when Weber was there in 1906-1907. 4 Max Weber to Abraham Walkowitz, 5 January 1908, Archives of American Art (NY59-8, F378). The Couvent du Sacre Coeur was requisitioned by the government to establish the Lycee Victor Duruy, which it remains today. The loss of the studio in 1911 enabled Matisse to extricate himself from teaching, which had become a chore for him. 5 Gertrude Stein, The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas (New York: Random House, 1933), p. 67. Weber claimed that Matisse did not charge students for his critiques, but the students rented the room and paid for the models; see Weber, The Reminiscences ofMax Weber, Carol S. Gruber, interviewer (Oral History Research Office, Columbia University, 1958), p. 62. See also Max Weber, "The Matisse Class," seventeen handwritten pages that he read at the Matisse symposium at the Museum of Modern Art, 19 November 1951, to accompany a retrospective of Matisse's paintings, Archives of American Art (NY59-6, F147-63). 6 Alvin Langdon Coburn to Gertrude Stein, 30 April 1913, Archives of American Art (N69-85, F307); also reproduced in Donald C. Gallup, The Flowers of Friendship: Letters Written to Gertrude Stein (New York: Knopf, 1953), p. 78. Gertrude Stein to Pablo Picasso, 1919, Archives Picasso, Paris; Leonard Folgarait brought this letter to my attention. 7 Weber's letters to Leo Stein are in the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University (YCAL, MSS 76, Box 130, No. 2833). Weber's 1908 caricatures of Leo Stein appear on a sheet of drawings in the Yale University Art Gallery and are illustrated in my book Max Weber: American Modern (New York: Jewish Museum, 1982), p. 16. For quote, see Weber, "The Matisse Class." 8 Both Weber and his friend the French painter Lucien Mainssieux claim that they went to Picasso's studio together. Weber on one occasion had lunch at the Bateau-Lavoir studio; see Reminis- cences, pp. 199, 234. After visiting Picasso's studio, Matisse introduced Pablo Picasso to African sculpture in 1906. The date of Weber's introduction to African art is undocumented, but he had seen Matisse's collection of wood carvings by the time he met Picasso in late 1908. Weber returned to the United States with two small, carved African figures, one of which he later featured in a still-life painting, Congo Statuette (1910), subsequently called African Sculpture, which was exhibited at 291 in 1911. After visiting Picasso's studio, Weber noted his allegiance to Cezanne's formal concerns over Matisse's colorism, in principle if not in practice, in a letter dated 9 December 1908 to Thomas D. Merrill, a friend from Minnesota who was also in Paris. The letter is in the Merrill family papers. 9 Max Weber to Pablo Picasso, 25 October 1908, Archives Picasso, Paris (author's translation). The painting has been in the Weber family since he purchased it in 1908. Weber's daughter, Joy S. Weber, remembers that the Picasso Still Life hung in the kitchen throughout her father's life. This particular Picasso painting is not included in either Christian Zervos's Pablo Picasso: Volume II-Oeuvres de 1906-1912 (Paris: Cahiers d'Art, 1942), or Pierre Daix's Picasso, The Cubist Years, 1907-1916: A Catalogue Raisonne of the Paintings and Related Works (Boston: New York Graphic Society, 1979). In the course of researching his massive multivolume Picasso biography, John Richardson expressed interest in the small still life. Unfortunately, miscommunication between us led him to think that Weber had not purchased the picture from Picasso. 10 Pablo Picasso to Max Weber, 10 November 1908, Archives of American Art (NY59-7, F519) (author's translation). 11 Scholars of cubism have frequently cited Picasso's Les Demoiselles dAvignon (1907) as the first cubist painting. William Rubin in his essay "The Genesis of Les Demoiselles d'Avignon," in Rubin, Helene Seckel, and Judith Cousins, Les Demoiselles dAvignon (New York: Museum of Modern Art, 1994), pp. 13-145, convincingly argues that Les Demoiselles d'Avignon represents a nascent form of cubism and that cubism was developed in 1908. On Picasso's studio visit, see Weber, Reminiscences, p. 200. A painting titled Summer is listed in the brochures for Weber's Haas 75 American Art</page><page sequence="19">Gallery exhibition in 1909 and his retrospective at 291 in 1911. It was also one of two works that he exhibited at the Union League Club in 1911. (However, there may have been other Weber paintings called Summer.) 12 Richardson in Life of Picasso, p. 111, surmises that Picasso's banquet honoring Rousseau took place on 21 November 1908. Art historian Sandra Leonard comments, "In the letter Rousseau wrote to Apollinaire on 4 December 1908, he asks him to thank 'Picasso et ces messieurs' for their reception"; see Leonard, Henri Rousseau and Max Weber (New York: Richard L. Feigen Gallery, 1970), p. 35. 13 This frequently repeated quote appears in Lloyd Goodrich's Max Weber (New York: for the Whitney Museum of American Art by the Macmillan Co., 1949), p. 16. 14 Weber to Picasso, 28 December 1908, Archives Picasso, Paris (author's translation). Weber's handwriting is not clear, and the French is scrambled and difficult to translate; the phrase "vous verez bien toi" may be "vous venez bien tot." Throughout his career Weber was compared unfavorably to Picasso. The similarities between his work and that of Picasso are first mentioned in reviews for the Younger American Painters exhibition. Gallery owner Charles Daniel wrote to Weber on 27 October 1914: "My Dear Mr. Weber-Thank you for your letter of October 24th- In reference to an Exhibition next year, would say that we hope to have an exhibition of original Matisses and Picassos, who will no doubt cover the modern field better than you can. Thanking you for your esteem, Sincerely, Charles Daniel." See Archives of American Art (N69-83, F46). As late as 1946, a headline in the Minneapolis Star Journal on October 10 read "Weber, Picasso of U.S., Got Start in Minnesota," alluding to Weber's teaching position in Duluth before his trip to Paris. 15 Weber mentioned that he was collecting books and reproductions in a letter to his friend Abraham Walkowitz, 5 January 1908, Archives of American Art (NY59-8, F378). In his Reminiscences, Weber recalled that he bought three original Toulouse-Lautrec posters. Sandra Leonard in Henri Rousseau, p. 26, mentions his purchase of Druet photographs of Cezanne's paintings. The Rousseau photograph, two paintings, vase, and cane; the Matisse tile; the Picasso painting; the Dutch, Japanese, and Toulouse-Lautrec prints; and the African sculpture remain in the Weber family. The Druet reproductions of Matisse, Gauguin, and eighteen Cezanne paintings are in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art. The Rousseau drawings and two of the four paintings were sold after Weber's death; Rousseau's View ofMalakoffis in the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh. The six Rousseau works, photograph, cane, and painted vase are illustrated in Leonard, Henri Rousseau, pp. 61-80, along with facsimilies of the letter from Picasso, letters from Rousseau to Weber, pp. 81-87, and the printed program from Rousseau's soiree for Weber, pp. 78-79. Matisse painted his celebrated Blue Nude (Souvenir of Biskra) in 1907 and exhibited it at the Salon des Independants that year. Leo Stein purchased the painting from the exhibit and hung it at his home. It is part of the Cone Collection of the Baltimore Museum of Art; Claribel Cone purchased it in 1926 from the John Quinn sale in Paris. A letter to Weber from his friend Mainssieux on 7 July 1908, Archives of American Art (NY59-7, F515), refers to their exchange of paintings, but it is the only documentation of the trade. 16 Weber's solo exhibition at the Haas Gallery opened a few days after the close of an exhibition of oil sketches by Alfred Maurer and watercolors by John Marin at 291. These were the first exhibitions by American artists to introduce the innovative flattened forms characteristic of modern art. See New York Morning Sun, 30 April 1909, Archives of American Art (NY59-6, F390); and American Art News, 3 May 1909. 17 In Reminiscences, p. 245, Weber discusses this "cubist" drawing of Bach's Coffee Cantata from one of his 1906 sketchbooks and says that cubism was then in its embryonic stage. 18 The short dresses of the music hall dancers in Weber's painting would have been scandalous on the city street in 1910. However, the costume was typical for dancers of the silent acts that opened the variety program of the vaudeville theater. In 1909 burlesque would not have been the "striptease" that is known by that name today, but was a satire of a serious play. Although the lists for Weber's 1910 and 1911 exhibitions at 291 include paintings called "Vaude- ville," the titles were changed to "Burlesque" when the paintings were later exhibited, since he may have confused vaudeville with burlesque. See Edwin Milton Royle, "The Vaudeville Theatre," Scribner's Magazine 26 (Oct. 1899): 495. 19 Les Demoiselles d5Avignon is extensively explored as Picasso's bordello picture and an allegory of syphilis in Rubin's essay, "Symbolic Theater in the Early Studies," in Les Demoiselles d5Avignon, pp. 42-91. Although simulated movement would become the dominant characteristic of Italian futurism, F. T. Marinetti's Manifeste du Futurisme appeared in Le Figaro on 20 February 1909, two months after Weber left the city, and it was unknown to him when he painted Spring Song. 20 "No Faked Names on These Paintings! No Sir-ree! They're by the 'Group of Younger American Painters,' They're the Last Word in Art, Says Mr. Stieglitz, Who's Been Exhibiting Them in Fifth Avenue, and Mrs. Whitney Has Bought One of'Em. So There!" See New York Morning World, clipping, Archives of American Art (NY59-6, F370), dated incorrectly in Weber's hand, Sunday, March 14, 1910; the actual date was April 3, 1910, in the Metropolitan section of the Sunday April Fool's edition, p. 2. Not only did Weber inscribe the wrong dates on the painting, it was also illustrated in the newspaper as a joke after the exhibition had closed. 21 "Untitled clipping," New York Ameri- can, Sunday, 19 March 1910, Archives of American Art (NY59-6, F355). 76 Fall 2000</page><page sequence="20">Weber's displeasure with Matisse surfaced in an antagonistic article called "Chinese Dolls and Modern Colorists," a diatribe against Matisse's fauve painting that Stieglitz published in Camera Work 31 (uly 1910): 51. 22 Gelette Burgess in "The Wild Men of Paris," Architectural Record 27, no. 5 (May 1910): 400-14, presented the harbingers of this new style to an educated American audience. Burgess illustrated paintings by Matisse, Picasso, Braque, Andre Derain, Jean Metzinger, and others. Their work showed elements of a style that would be dubbed "cubism" several months after Burgess departed from Paris in the summer of 1908, although the term does not appear in the article. Burgess referred to them all as "Les Fauves," but this designation would have best suited the work of Matisse. By spring 1908 when Burgess conducted his interviews, Braque and Derain had turned away from fauvism; see Burgess, "Wild Men,"p. 407. 23 Anonymous (Alfred Stieglitz?), "The Exhibitions at '291,"' Camera Work 36 (Oct. 1911): 29. 24 "Arthur Hoeber in the N. Y Globe," republished in Camera Work 36 (Oct. 1911): 31. 25 Picasso's drawing Standing Figure (1910), now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, remained in Stieglitz's collection from this exhibition. 26 Weber's "The Fourth Dimension from a Plastic Point of View," published in Stieglitz's increasingly art-oriented photography journal Camera Work in 1910, was a groundbreaking internationally influential theoretical treatise. Linda Dalrymple Henderson extensively explores Weber's contribu- tion to the theoretical basis of cubism in The Fourth Dimension and Non- Euclidean Geometry in Modern Art (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1983) and in "Mabel Dodge, Gertrude Stein, and Max Weber: A Four Dimensional Trio," Arts 57, no. 1 (Sept. 1982), pp. 106-11. See also Willard Bohn, "In Pursuit of the Fourth Dimension: Guillaume Apollinaire and Max Weber," Arts 54, no. 10 (une 1980): 166-69. 27 A 1948 poll of museum professionals designated Weber second only to John Marin in its selection of the ten best painters in America; see "Are These Men the Best Painters in America Today?"
