<plain_text><page sequence="1">With the help of some technological extension allowing the human body to be - partially at least - in any place of the world at anytime, or even in a multiplicity of time or space, the anthropomorphic subject started its distention with the physical reality. - Frédéric Levirat , "Anti-Cubist Cube " Is it possible that even a friend of mine - an architect from Switzerland , living in New York - has finally been seduced by the trendy discourse of media technology? Recently he published an essay in Japan on a Japanese architect , which I translated . In that essay, Frédéric argues that due to recent advances in media technology , our bodies now have the capacity to overcome the obstacles of distance and time . Now , I know that Frédéric' s girlfriend lives in Switzerland , and they are torn apart by this very physical distance. So I wonder , "Has this media technology managed to melt the distance between you two? That isn't so, is it?" I do not really mean to take exception to Frédéric' s point because I am well aware of what he attempts to convey by invoking media technology . Although we know that the objective world is comprised of such givens as the natural body and natural perception, new media technology reveals to us that these seemingly natural givens are themselves composites of previous technologies . No doubt, herein lies Frédéric9 s concern . Even though physical distance and physical time, and indeed the body and perception, may have been superseded with the acceleration of media technology, it is this same media technology, by an act of renewed institutionalization, that normalizes our body and perception . Media technology always appears as that which overcomes certain physical obstacles - boundaries, distance, time, quantity, and so on. But, as history has shown, it has also contributed to the normalization or consolidation of other substantive , or seemingly essential, domains - state, race, community, class. What remains in our present situation is a kind of distance without physical space and physical time, a "media distance " as the Japanese novelist Seiko Ito calls it. As Frédéric in fact points out in his article, even though media distance might be devoid of physical distance, this does not mean that our consciousness, perception, and body have overcome " distance " per se. Even though everything - substantial or not - exists around us in the closest possible proximity, we all are always "distanciated" from each other by the thin and precise membrane of "media distance ." I am apprehensive about the advocacy of "overcoming distance and time," especially in contemporary Japan, where the prevailing mood is one of unrestrained optimism. Recently, Crown Prince Naruhito was engaged to Masako, a commoner. Surprisingly, this was first publicized not by the Japanese mass media but by the Washington Post and CNN. Similarly, SO years ago when Emperor Akihito, then Crown Prince, was engaged, it was the American mass media that broadcast it first . This happened not because of any incompetency on the part of the Japanese media but because of the strict controls placed on the broadcast industry in Japan. A Japanese intellectual observed on the occasion of this reprise that the Japanese mass media had not improved in SO years. It seems that the majority of Japanese are more thrilled with forestalling the American mass media than upset by it. If so, is this distance between the individual Japanese citizen and the Emperor purely physical, ideal, spatial, or temporal? Must it be affirmed? Or should it be cancelled once and for all? To this aporia, which many postwar Japanese have attempted but failed to resolve, Ito' s "media distance" offers a convenient answer, if not an outright solution. The breaking story from America regarding the Japanese princess-to- be, in other words, is really not so much about Masako Owada, but 56</page><page sequence="2">about how media technology has overcome physical distance and physical time ; and how it offers not only a temporal annulment of the mysterious though virtual distance between the Japanese people and their Emperor, but also an illusion that distance - by being converted into "media distance" - can be shared the world over. Today, many Japanese architects have become interested in "transparency." Commenting on the architectural results of this larger cultural trend, the editor of an important architectural journal recently observed that "our future can be vividly foreseen in the return of such mild modernist architecture ." Many Japanese critics have suggested that the proponents of transparent architecture all share an interest in four issues or values - the " environment ," "openness," the "public sphere ," and " technology " - which seem to form a kind of nontransgressable value matrix of transparency . But this is not exactly true. In fact, a close reading of their texts and their architectures makes it clear that for these " architects of transparency" the truly nontransgressable value(s) are not environment, openness, public sphere, and technology but are instead those associated with media distance itself Moreover, these transparent architectures have no political dimension - no "marginal effect," to use Jeff Kipnis's term, which might ultimately be invoked to prosecute the terrorism of "transcendental values." In fact, it is difficult to ascertain the existence of any kind of transcendental subject within these transparent architectures because their process of becoming-transparent is totally vague and impossible to trace. To be sure, these transparent architectures are not possessed of the Unheimlichkeit that impels the subject onward in its search for its proper relationship to its other. In short, the "present passion for see- through building" (Anthony Vidier) exhibited by these architects is limited to the production of architectures so precise and so thin that they approach nothingness. It is this technical obsession alone, and not a concern with the more properly philosophical issues of media technology, that guides their interest in environment, openness, public sphere, and technology. Walking around Tokyo the other day with an Italian architect, we encountered a throng of young boys and girls shopping in a fancy store somewhat like Tiffany's. This architect asked me, " What on earth are they buying here?" I answered, "Condoms." The work of the Japanese architect that my friend Frédéric wrote about is considered an example of transparent architecture. In the essay he concludes : "As everything becomes transparent, a subject experiences a true temporal reality, a true spatial reality, and a true corporeality." This transparent architecture - protected by the thin and precise membrane of media technology - dreams of "a universal and absolute subject presenting its existence via individual actions"; that is to say, in my opinion, it is merely like Hegelianism protected by a condom. No one, I assume, would take exception with my observation that the entire political, economical, and cultural situation in Japan is today captive to this obsession with transparency. Le réélis nevertheless always ripped outward to its exterior. Translated from the Japanese by Sabu Kohso.
