She is work- ing on her Ph.D. in architectural history at the University of California, Berkeley. Assemblage 35: 62-79 ? 1998 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Adi Shamir Zion New Modern: Architecture in the Age of Digital Technology Bill Gates, the chairman and chief executive officer of Microsoft Corporation is building a house in Seattle. In the "Plugged in at Home" chapter of his recent book The Road Ahead, Gates describes his new house and walks us through his personal vision of the home of the future. Its owner refers to the house as a "test site" for the integration of future tech- nology into the home, and it promises to be fully loaded with the newest, most advanced technology available, to be constantly updated as the technology progresses. Gates's de- scriptions of plans for the house are revealing for they expose issues central to the discourse surrounding the relationship between digital technology and architecture. The Gates House is more than a wealthy man's dream- house: it serves as a model of intention with potentially significant cultural and commercial implications and, as such, needs to be considered within a framework that ex- tends beyond the constituent determinants of the building itself to the coeval artistic, scientific, political, and ethical debates of which it is a part. In the present essay, key pas- sages from Gates's book are selected and analyzed, par- ticularly those that address the desired quality of building materials, the occupant/systems interface, and the program- matic requirements. An analysis of the material choices and construction intent elaborated by Gates raises questions of 63</page><page sequence="2">m.I- I I M U . , ) Uu</page><page sequence="3">assemblage 35 authenticity and structural clarity that insert the narrative into an ongoing debate tracing late-nineteenth-century ar- guments on issues of spatial representation and tectonics. An attempt to locate the origins of contemporary concepts such as "interactivity" or "virtuality" and current specifica- tions for the design of "cyberspace" invoked by Gates iden- tifies the artistic and scientific propositions of avant-garde movements in the early decades of the century. Further, the space planning and programming of this "house of the future," and the distinct motives for its production, are ex- amined within the context established by historical futurist manifestos as well as the Fordist industrial practices that permitted their realization. The comparison that evolves juxtaposes the architecture that is associated with the emergence of new technologies of the industrial revolution and the architecture that may now be emerging alongside electronic digital technology. This parallel presentation is, however, a problematic con- struction and must redefine its own terms by differentiating between the two often interchangeable concepts of "mod- ernization" and "modernity." The forces of modernization tied directly to the processes of industry must be understood as profoundly different from those generated by the capac- ity of critique inherent in the experiment of modernity. This differentiation is at the heart of the following investiga- tion and is based, in turn, on a set of questions: Can the Gates House be called a modern house? If not, what are the implications of the Gates House for the discipline of archi- tecture? Will the discipline of architecture follow the ap- parent lead of the new digital industry or will the discipline lead with a critical agenda? In describing plans for his new home, Gates draws our at- tention to the abundance of exposed beams and "vertical supports" milled from huge five-hundred-year-old timber: The house has lots of exposed horizontal beams and vertical supports. You'll have a great view of the lake. Most of the wood came from an eighty-year-old Weyerhaeuser lumber mill that was being torn down out on the Columbia River. This wood, harvested nearly a hundred years ago, came from trees that were as much as 350 feet tall, between 8 and 15 feet in diameter. Douglas fir is one of the strongest woods in the world for its weight. Unfortunately, new-growth Douglas fir tends to split if you try to mill it into beams, because the grain is not as tight in a seventy-year-old tree as it is in a five-hundred-year-old one. Al- most all of the old-growth Douglas fir has been harvested now, and any remains should be preserved. I was lucky to find old- growth timbers that could be reused.' The bones of building are exposed, but that they are over- sized timbers suggests that, while the materials may be ves- tiges of a nineteenth-century industry, their application represents a departure from the concern in nineteenth- century American residential construction for the efficient use of timber, which had resulted in the sober balloon frame. It also suggests a departure from nineteenth-century European theoretical interest in using the thinnest possible members of iron - the Gates House timber would have been harvested some seventy years after John Nash had de- signed cast-iron columns in the form of palm trees for the kitchen of the Royal Pavilion at Brighton. What, then, can we make of Gates's choice of building materials? Does it re- flect a nostalgia for a lost Americana or perhaps a commit- ment to environmental sustainability? And how can the use of the timbers and all they represent be reconciled with the products and futuristic features that the house will contain? The digital and electronic technology that Gates hopes to have integrated into the house does not seem to be re- flected in the actual structural operations of the house; quite to the contrary, evidence of the digital circuitry and electronic machinery is absent. Instead, a lingering mod- ernist image of structural veracity cloaks a sentimentality for premodern construction techniques and native materi- als. Gates distinguishes between the hard and soft materials 64</page><page sequence="4">Shamir Zion that constitute the house, and it becomes clear that the de- sire to integrate the new digital technology with traditional materials and quasi-traditional methods is actually the wish to conceal one within the other. In this sense, the differ- ence between the two is amplified, so that although their merger will ultimately be seamless they will nonetheless re- main distinct. William Mitchell, who in City of Bits muses on the challenges of architecture in the digital age, insists that "building these programmable places is not just a mat- ter of putting wires in the walls and electronic boxes in rooms. As the relevant technologies continue to develop miniaturized distributed computational devices will disap- pear into the woodwork."' We, in turn, are compelled to ask, what is the woodwork and why the woodwork? Gates does not appear to be invoking a Gesamtkunstwerk ethic in the tradition of Walter Gropius and Adolf Meyer's 1922 Sommerfeld House, designed as a log house with carved wood interior details and stained-glass widows. Nor is the Gates House reminiscent of its heroic "experimental" coun- terpart, the Versuchshaus designed by Meyer and Georg Muche for the Bauhaus Exhibition of 1923 and conceived as a Wohnmaschine, or living machine, with exposed radia- tors, steel windows and door frames, and unshaded tubular light fixtures. In the Gates House the computing machine should not call attention to itself: "Not only will the invis- ible software disappear into the woodwork, but hardware will as well." Gates continues: At the bottom of the stairs, the theater will be on the right, and to the left, on the south side, will be a reception hall. As you step into the reception hall, on your right will be a series of sliding glass doors that open onto a terrace leading to the lake. Recessed in the east wall will be twenty-four video monitors, each with a 40-inch picture tube, stacked four high and six across. These monitors will work cooperatively to display large images for artis- tic, entertainment, or business purposes. I had hoped that when the monitors weren't in use they could literally disappear into the woodwork. I wanted the screens to display wood-grain pat- terns that matched their surroundings. Unfortunately I could never achieve anything convincing with current technology, because a monitor emits light while real wood reflects it. So I settled for having the monitors disappear behind wood panels when they're not in use.' Gates does not want technology to dominate the house and therefore proposes to "recess" the machine's wires, chips, and switches - its infrastructure. The material that does dominate, a reminder of the authentic or "real" - that is, the wood - is asked to lend its image once again as cam- ouflage in a twenty-four-screen projection. Tectonic theory as postulated by the Abbe Laugier in the Essai sur l'archi- tecture of 1753 and revisited by Gottfried Semper in Four Elements ofArchitecture of 1851 here undergoes a strange inversion. Within the constitutive matrix of the model of primordial dwellings he proposed, Semper defined the lightweight enclosing membrane as a "tensile frame" with infill that, no matter what the material, would still be con- ceived as a phenomenally transparent grid "structured about a hierarchical articulation of discrete parts."4 But Semper maintained the distinction between the symbolic and the technical aspects of construction, or as Kenneth Frampton elucidates, "between the skin that re-presents the composite character of the construction and the core of a building that is simultaneously both its fundamental struc- ture and its substance."' In the case of the Gates House, we might consider the weave, Semper's wall, as the embroidered monitor screen and we might think of the infilled textile as being the pro- jected computer depiction of wood. Here, however, the "screen" attempts to disguise itself as the image of the wooden structural frame, thereby trespassing the clearly de- lineated distinction between the technical and the sym- bolic defined by Semper and corroborated by generations of buildings. This leads us to the possibility that the house's structure - that is, the wood beams and columns and the concrete foundation - might, after all, not be Semper's 65</page><page sequence="5">assemblage 35 technical aspect. Perhaps the technical aspect here, "the core of the building," is the system of binary synapses cours- ing through as a structure of invisible material. Everything else - the wood beams, the wood panels, and the digitized wood pattern - might be infill fabric; the symbolic aspect of the house. The questions surrounding the authenticity of material become redirected not because one material mim- ics another - that crisis has been long-standing - but because the very meaning of building art (Baukunst), the tectonic elements that constitute rational construction as defined in Hendrick Petrus Berlage's Grundlagen und Entwicklung der Architektur, is now called into question. If we maintain the formula of this inversion and continue to identify all the wood in the Gates House as "the repre- sentation of composite character," we realize that, as such, it is a dimensionally thick and redundantly layered assem- bly. It is not a minimal, taut cladding but a thickly padded, ornamental fabric whose final decorative coat is the wood varnish of the LCD projection. Thus the guts of the vital image are lodged within an ornamental space of truly inesti- mable depth and material poch6. How might the spatial experience resulting from such a "thick" assembly compare to the spatial qualities of another modernist example, the Barcelona Pavilion? Here the building's physical elements are dematerialized through the use of reflective material fin- ishes as well as transparent, translucent, tinted, and opaque glass to disband whatever space may have been contained within the centrifugal lines of force. While there are no monitors per se in the pavilion, the visitor can engage the building not only optically and mentally but also, it seems, virtually. The image of one material is reflected in the rich surface of another, and bound by these ambiguous borders, space - as a phenomenological substance - is at once densely embodied and fugitively thin. Perhaps this is what Mies van der Rohe meant when he referred to the quality of an architecture manifest as beinahe nichts (almost nothing). It seems to indicate a built reality that is immanently absent. Weight is not actually displaced, nor does matter disappear. Rather, the visitor to the pavilion cannot help but intuit the precisely calibrated equivalence of material and space as a levitation. It is not the visitor, however, who is meant to feel weightless, nor does the building proper "lift." Displace- ment occurs at the very moment of transposition in which matter as weight and space as mass are exchanged. Spatial extension is not caused merely by the lack of corners or con- taining boundaries; instead, space is emblazoned onto the reflected image of marble in the other's transparent veining. The antispace of the building is to be "found" in its doubled and then halved reflective surfaces where raw stone is so highly polished that its marbled texture can no longer be sensed tactilely. Its geological identity is restrained, and sus- pended beneath the honed surface is the material essence of the stone. The burred edges that would have refracted light are smoothed and the crystals cut now reflect light as well as the opposite wall's material image. The material im- age of one surface is manifest in the surface of another ma- terial, denying the visitor a singular reading of any one of its surfaces or of the actual materiality of any surface. Mies's "almost nothing," then, might be thought of as the demate- rialization of a building reflected in multiple images whose originating source cannot be isolated; or as one whose sin- gular image is saturated with an essence of materiality that surpasses its very tangibility. The pavilion is its own image, reflected in its walls are the pictures of itself. In the Barcelona Pavilion, not only is the identity of the stone transformed when so highly polished, but also that of the continuous glass sash. Polished to reflect the green, red, and ochre hues of the Greek Tinos marble, the Alpine Valle d'Aosta marble, the Moroccan Onyx Dore, and the Roman Travertine, the glass resembles the deep colloidal quality of the superthin alabaster windowpanes used by the ancients. Thus we can "see through" a solid material like 66</page><page sequence="6">Shamir Zion marble and still be offered visual resistance by a "clear" glass. But in the Gates House, the use of glass is as strangely literal as the use of wood. Mitchell reminds us that the trade colloquialism for running silicon/fiber optic cabling and Integrated Services Digital Network lines is "pulling glass"; that is, the telecommunications network, which ac- tually began in 1837 with the telegraph, is now a digital wireless system that uses a "glass" as an invisible and "in- conspicuous" conduit.6 Yet, while glass is infrastructural and pervasive throughout the Gates House, taking the form of complex circuitry - and in this sense, we can say it truly dematerializes and thereby liberates the house - glass is also used conventionally in the windows of the house. Win- dows separate inside from outside and windows function as computer screens and both types operate as traditional, pre-Scheerbartian figural openings cut into a wall to frame particular views. Lily Reich had used glass as a wall skin, eliminating the framed window and thereby extending the building onto the landscape. But in the Gates House, the glazed surfaces that form the interior/exterior window wall membrane, through which we might see the changing col- ors of the Lake Washington forest, begin to resemble the digitized images within the computer screen's framed aper- ture. The trees "outside" are projected into the house; they belong to the house as a captured, contained set of bucolic images prepared for the viewer's consumption. While the materials of the Barcelona Pavilion are made to disappear only to be reconstituted in their own reflection, the Gates House seems to be all body, tending toward a rustic and literal construction. Strangely enough, as the electronic technology becomes less dimensional, the ar- chitecture expresses a nostalgia not for the authenticity of material per se but for the look and feel of the "natural." Tectonic articulation is exaggerated with the aim of express- ing not structural truth but the image of structure. As we know, Gates acknowledges the currently unavoidable flaw in attempting the naturalistic depiction of natural wood us- ing the computed medium: the (authentic) grain of real wood reflects light and the (inauthentic) mathematical re- construction of wood pattern on the monitor emits it. In the Gates House, in the end, wood is used to emulate a (very large) rustic cabin with no need for the mediation of ab- straction. The fabric of the screens, unlike the polished materials used by Mies, is entirely nonreflective and unam- biguous. While the pavilion's screen membrane is made of opaque material, its material quality is transparent, tending toward immateriality and four-dimensional space. The building and its reflection in the courtyard pool form one whole whose identity is narrative and factual, fictive and actual. The image on the computer screen, by contrast, is continuously recreated (not layered, as it may appear) in' pixelated raster patterns. The absence of reflectivity as an in- terpretational device renders an ultimately opaque reality. The stored digital media projected on the screen must be added to the taxonomy of building materials and domestic desires alluded to in Gates's descriptions. When we view the CD-ROM included in the back of his book, we are re- minded of the particular qualities of that same screen on which we do so much of our work these days, the way in which information is created, accessed, and archived, and the very medium that Gates sells. Consider the representa- tional and spatial syntax of the computer's navigational graphics. When we use the computer even for simple tasks such as word processing, we can access several independent information screens, each a world unto its own, simulta- neously. The accumulated depth of the screens one behind the other is inestimable. The constructed image of infor- mation is ultimately highly spatial, but in a way that is remi- niscent of images that we have seen before. Though the previous descriptions of the Gates House seem to undo a 67</page><page sequence="7">assemblage 35 particular preoccupation with dematerialization and ab- straction shared by a community of artists and architects in the early part of the century - reinstating, instead, the ma- teriality, stereotomic anchoring, and articulation of building boundaries and frames - could it be that interaction with computer media returns us to a certain modernist sensibil- ity? Can we not say that the computer's superimposed trans- parent and opaque layers form a nongravitational field much like the horizonless scape of El Lissitzky's Proun studies (Project for the Affirmation of the New)? Lissitzky had us navigate through the space of the Proun in much the same way as we now move through the computer's stored memory. Lissitzky's description of space - which "begins as a level surface and then turns into a mode of three- dimensional space, ... [an] interchange station between painting and architecture, ... pictorially and ontologically a dynamic new space,.. . intended as more than something the spectator would look at passively but [that is] to be a spatial environment into which one could imaginatively project oneself" - might well refer to a computer-animated graphic.i Did Lissitzky envision the computer or did the modernists' experiments in the representation of abstract space leave a profound impression on our cultural psyche? Perhaps it is possible to locate precedents for the notions of space and spatial representation used in the contemporary design of cyberspace and digital technology in the modern- ist works of art and architecture produced in the first de- cades of this century. It is important, however, to note that it is unlikely that participants in Xerox PARC or program- mers for Apple Computer, or Bill Gates himself despite his stake in valuable images via his Corbis Corporation, con- sulted examples of modern art, architecture, or twelve-tonal music in developing the new science and technology. Yet modernist works like Lissitzky's may be defined as prece- dents when viewed from a metahistorical perspective, for they anticipated ideas about space and about the relation- ship between human and machine. While we are accustomed to identifying the origins of com- putability with the revolution in mathematics and particu- larly with the development in the mid-nineteenth century of geometries of more than three dimensions, we rarely trace the lineage of cyberspace narrative and imagery to the moment in time in which profound changes prepared the ground, simultaneously, for both cubist painting and Einstein's general theory of relativity." David Hilbert's for- malization in 1900 of the concept of abstract space (as an explanation and a site for the nonreal phenomena dis- played by newly discovered subatomic particles that behave strangely when mapped in physical space) not only prefig- ured Alan Turing's Universal Machine, the predecessor of our computing machines, but resulted in an entirely new conception of material, metaphysical, and social space.9 Just as the mathematical system based on principles from the ancient Greeks was no longer grounded in the (un)certainty of physical reality but in a higher abstract formal realm, so, too, were notions of spatial location and occupation liberated from the constraints of the physical world. The motivating force behind the early modernists' "futurist" projections demanded that the artist become a social revolutionary and aesthetic liberator and that the universal representational language of this revolution be one of geometrical abstraction. The significance of abstract mathematics to the develop- ment of a Universal Machine as well as to the development of cubism, suprematism, and neoplasticism reveals a cer- tain conceptual lineage that the computer and modern art may share. And yet it is interesting to recognize that while their origins may be linked, the manifestation of the one has diverged dramatically from the intention of the other. Kasimir Malevich's suprematist ideology, which evolved as 68</page><page sequence="8">? Li~ oI~i r -'?C )?0? ?'NJ-?</page><page sequence="9">assemblage 35 a search for the abstract as a response to a disenchantment with material truth, entailed a categorical rejection of the imitation of natural shapes. It called for the renunciation of nature and its arbitrary and irrational references. Antiper- spectival, axonometric, nonoptical renderings and fractured projections were derived as abstract representational formu- lae stripped of all naturalistic, practical, national, and his- torical references. The process, as Robin Evans writes of Piet Mondrian's practice, required "painstaking subtrac- tion. His ambition was to remove all contingency."'0 While modernism rejected perspective drawings as imprisoning constructs, the developers of cyberspace imagery seem, de- spite the powerful arguments of postmodern fracture, to have inherited a "Renaissance" worldview that places the eye of the viewer in a singularly, centrally, privileged posi- tion. High-resolution graphics, then, must render images exactly as they are in the material world. According to tech- nology pioneer Thomas Furness, in order to experience immersion or inclusion in virtual world we need to stimulate the entire visual field including our periph- eral vision. The angle for convincing field of vision is 120 de- grees. The virtual image has to subtend or cover fully one third of the circle of things around us.11 Jaron Lanier proposes a similar but even more spiritually disconcerting hermeneutical theory. He argues that in "post-symbolic communication" cyberspace reality side- steps the process of translation into and out of symbolic representation: The way you talk to your body doesn't use symbols . . . You can make a cup that someone else can pick up ... without ever hav- ing to use a picture or the word 'cup.'. . . You create the experi- ential object 'cup' rather than the symbolic object.12 Thus the stereographic image presented in the automation of pictorial representation is realistically known, but it is neither mediated nor abstracted. El Lissitzky's Proun painting exhibition of 1923, which re- affirmed the great struggle to abolish an illusionist concep- tion of life in all its forms "while building an elementary world of exact and splendid reality," was an idealistic vision of the future joined with a practical concern for a tangible quality of life. Abstract geometrical shapes brought into an abstract totality were manifest in the conception of univer- sal space. The new vision and spatial orientation of geomet- ric abstraction as a representational and symbolic language was at the core of the utopian vision of "art and life brought into dynamic unity."' By comparison, the agenda of builders of cyberspace to deliver more intimate interfaces generates a demand for more photorealistic graphics. Computer graphics call for greater mimesis in the digital simulation of organic form. Although the last decades' poststructuralist criticism questions the possibility of a cul- turally constructed "natural" natural, its skepticism is not endorsed. The environments produced as a sequence of computer-generated images attempt to simulate or imitate "real life" within a nondimensional site. Turing's Universal Machine revealed the underlying computational structure to everything, but to achieve a nearly tactile, almost sensual likeness, today's programmer must mask the machine, pro- viding the user with the most familiar, banal, identifiable signs, symbols, and icons. While modernism's mute ab- straction permits us to inhabit the virtual scape of reality, computer-generated virtuality is a padded, and inescapably literal, reality. When we examine the programmatic requirements that the Gates House is asked to fulfill, we find that while the mod- ernist ideal is touted as inspirational, its inherent polemical intentions are denied. Bill Gates describes the qualities with which he wishes to endow his new house: 70</page><page sequence="10">Shamir Zion Like almost anyone who contemplates building a house, I want mine to be in harmony with its surroundings and with the needs of the people who will occupy it. I want it to be architecturally appealing. Mostly though I want it to be comfortable. It's where my family and I will live. A house is an intimate companion or, in the words of the great twentieth century architect Le Corbusier, 'a machine for living in.'14 As a sound bite, the Corbusian aphorism is suggestive, if not seductive, for twenty-first-century citizens wired to a global network, but it is actually a misappropriation and one that occurs on two fronts. First, for Gates, the "ma- chine for living in" is imbued with a personality of accom- modation and benign comfort. It does not share in what Fritz Neumeyer describes as Le Corbusier's "Dionysian definition of the art of building, inspired by Nietzsche's theory of tragedy in which passion builds 'drama out of in- ert' stone. . . . Le Corbusier saw the machine for living as a 'palace' in which each organ of the house, merely by means of the relationship to the whole, could stir us so movingly as to reveal the magnitude and nobility of intent."'5 Second, it does not acknowledge the utopian socialist convictions that might be evidenced in Le Corbusier's praise for the "deflec- tion of the egoistic property instinct towards a feeling for collective action" - a quality that he recognized as po- tential in the reinforced-concrete Van Nelle Factory in Rotterdam designed by Mart Stam and L. C. Van der Vlugt in 1927-29.'" Le Corbusier's observations (observations, since it is questionable whether he strove to implement the political ideologies heralding collectivization) of the political and spiritual principle of collectivity echoed architecture's new imperative to act as an efficient and ob- jective "machine" in the cause of "a single force," as Stamin wrote in "Kollektive Gestaltung": "The modern outlook... sees life as the single reaching out of a single force. This means that what is special and individual must yield to what is common to all.""' In Gates's descriptions this dialectic unravels. Instead, there is a clear emphasis on the subjective experience of the occu- pant, and the subjective "nature" of the constituent ele- ments of the house may be identified on several levels. The terms of the overall economic and philosophical principles that Gates espouses - in which the individual participant is delineated and given an individual voice and accessibility through a vast network of information - provide a clear contrast to the monolithic needs of the masses as identified by Stam. For Gates, the community bound by communica- tion and information is one in which private needs are met. To the techniques of scientific management, consumerism, and productive capital, Gates adds the notion of "friction free capitalism." His predecessor Henry Ford's "Life and Work" is expanded in Gates's version of democratic capital- ism: the mass production of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is replaced with a customized mass manufacture tailored to the specifications of the individual. The industrial machine, and more specifically the fabricat- ing machine that performs a specific task repetitively, can be instructed to perform "irregular" patterns as easily as it can standardized or regular ones. The once anonymous machine now conforms to the requirements of the con- sumer as the unique subject's subjective desires are fulfilled: "Soon there will be computerized shirt-making machines that will obey a different set of instructions for every shirt."'" The operations of customized mass production, as opposed to identical repetitive activity, result in an animated mecha- nization and in the manufacture of idiosyncratic products. Customization as a programmatic formula can also be found in discussions of computer interfaces. Marcos Novak identi- fies the tailor-made experiences that anticipate the expecta- tions and requirements of the computer user as the animistic properties of the cyber experience." Novak not only refers to the subjective tastes of the consumer and the subjective 71</page><page sequence="11">assemblage 35 activities of the machine object but also to the particular features and personalities of the subjectified object in cyberspace. The animism of objects, that is, the attribution of conscious life to inanimate objects, has its precedents in an- cient practices. In its most recent incarnation as defined by Novak, there occurs an interchange of body and spirit. This interchange grants organic, bodylike characteristics to cyber- constructions while the generators (the human operators) of these cyber-constructions take on the role of pure mind and become the spirits of these cyber-organisms. While Gates's misuse of the Corbusian ideal may not have in mind the existential debate that Novak's anthropomor- phic cyberspace elicits, it does prescribe a particular rela- tionship in which the machine and user must engage. Gates's "machine for living in" must obey, serve, and, at the same time, function as "companion," providing unobtrusive service much like the servant class in relation to the master in the "upstairs/downstairs" quarters of the English country house. In other words, the Gates House reverts back to the premodern house, a hierarchically delineated and divided organism that is anthropomorphic in that it is a full-size representation of the programmatic peculiarities (resem- bling those that the manor house might have had, such as monogrammed fixtures, three sinks in the changing room, duplicate dining rooms, and mistress' chambers) housed within. Thus, in opposition to the modern housing program that denies reference to the specific characteristics of its in- dividual residents, projecting instead their collective identity - by its very nature a subjectless one - the Gates House tracks its occupants in order to meet their particular needs and com- bines two traditions. The first is the tradition of unobtrusive service, and the other is that an object we carry entitles us to be treated in a certain way. You're already used to the idea that an object can au- thenticate you. It can inform people or machinery that you have permission to do something such as open a locked door, get on an airplane, or use a specific line of credit - yours - to make pur- chases.... It's no different with my house, which will make various amenities available to you based on the electronic key you carry.2' In the Gates House man and machine are solipsistically complicit, and it could become difficult to distinguish the machine/house environment from the machine/man: The electronic pin you wear will tell the house who and where you are, and the house will use this information to try to meet and anticipate your needs - all as unobtrusively as possible.21 The electronic pin might well have been conceived by Myron Krueger whose infamous Glow Flow installation op- erated with pressure pads located in the floor that would ac- tivate sequences of sound and lights as they were touched. The primary conceptual objective for his work and the work of those who followed was the notion of a symbiosis between humans and machines, participants in what Krueger described as a "feedback loop.""2 The development of responsive physical environments is, in a sense, the counterpart to the development of inhabitable, nonphysi- cal, computer-generated virtual environments within which, according to Ivan Sutherland, the leading developer of military flight and vehicle simulators, "the computer can control the existence of matter."" For Sutherland, the "artificial" cockpit experience was a highly controlled "interface" between pilot and simulator of flying aircraft. The pilot's manipulation of the controls would act as input from which the computer would generate equations for modeling multisensory arrangements of information as out- put. Both the total immersion of the "user" (or occupant) in a given landscape and the smooth interface of user and artificial (or actual) environment are the operative terms of an emergent cyberreality as well as the objectives of dwell- ing. William Mitchell giddily relates this interface to a new type of inhabitation that he describes as having "less to do with parking your bones in an architecturally defined space and more with connecting your nervous system to nearby 72</page><page sequence="12">Shamir Zion electronic organs.""4 Following these models, the Gates House not only attends to, but also watches its occupants. This sort of surveillance seems the ultimate condemnation of the original invocation of the coziness of "home." Gates's house tour leads us on a linear journey that re- sembles the scripted path of a computer-generated video game. Up a hall the length of the house, then back down the hall, with events happening along the way to our left and right, all the while connected by an electronic pin to the house's entire electronic system. The lightweight electronic control attached to the body seems as though it would be the supreme liberating mechanism, granting us access to and control over where we are as well as interactive participation in the totality of our environment. Laszlo Maholy-Nagy, in his vision of an interactive dwelling that "will function not as a self-contained machine, but a biological and psychological extension of the New Man integrated with his environment," certainly imagined a sort of freedom that could only be achieved with the utopian merging of art and life." In the Gates House, however, we are presented with a strange and literal aberration that neither Maholy-Nagy's Total Theater nor Krueger's "beautiful interface" could have foreseen. The house becomes an electronically augmented and reconfigurable extension of the inhabitant that, like Sutherland's "ultimate display," is not only visual or aural but kinesthetic. Ultimately, the "electronic pin" functions as an electronic tether that, though invisible, binds the occupant to its location. More than this, it privileges the electronic "eye" that logs each of the occupant's gestures, thereby further binding the occupant to the operations of the house. Interactivity may be maximized and the man/ machine interface fulfilled, but space as understood metaphysically by the spirit of the occupant is narrowed, weighted, and confined. Here Le Corbusier's ideal is once again undone in that his democratization was achieved with a true manifestation of spatial continuum in the form of the free plan, as it had been for Frank Lloyd Wright in the "destruction of the box." These were ideas shared by a community of artists who, while capitulating to the tyran- nies of modern industrialization that by 1915 could not be ignored, attempted to break free from gravity's limitations, envisioning a spatial continuum created not through elec- tronic augmentation or global interconnectivity, but in the pursuit of universal and spatial abstraction. In the spring of 1994 I participated as a member of the jury at a Harvard architecture thesis review. A student had com- pleted the presentation of his project in which he proposed the design of programmed areas in an airport that were to be modeled after ATM machines as individual stations performing various operations. The proposal prompted a de- bate about the relevance of the new digital process to archi- tecture. Helpful suggestions and some skeptical remarks were volleyed among the critics. Just as we began to wrap up, Eduard Sekler, a venerable professor at the university who had been sitting quietly among the audience of students, delivered the point that we had all somehow neglected and with somewhat worn wisdom spoke: "Technology is never banal." Why had he not been invited to attend the review I wondered. But I knew that it was actually his message that had been overlooked in recent years. The message contains warning, expectation, resignation, and a call to action. It cor- responds as convincingly to our present condition as it would have to the world a century ago. Despite the challenges leveled at the Enlightenment ideolo- gies of empiricism, utilitarianism, and rationalism by such thinkers as Ferdinand de Saussure, Claude Levi-Strauss, and Roland Barthes, it appears that with the birth of the new 73</page><page sequence="13">assemblage 35 electronic and computer technologies, the Comte de Saint- Simon's notion of human progress and technological devel- opment as a wholly positive proposition has been once more embraced by many disciplines, including architecture. The unquestioning belief of a new generation of producers and consumers in the potentiality and inevitability of the new technology's impact upon, among other things, the built en- vironment tells us that we are no longer burdened by doubt and deconstruction. Rather, we find ourselves on the thresh- old of a reinvigorated modernization, as eager, blinded, and certain as its predecessor. And here a distinction must be drawn between the modernization already in full force in the 1880s and the modernist program of artists and architects after World War I. For the exuberant belief in technology and in progress demonstrated at the close of this century, whether by those with a vested interest such as Bill Gates or by the rest of us as consumers, resembles the faith of James Bogardus, C.-L.-F. Dutert, or Joseph Paxton at the close of the last century, and not the activities of modernists working in Weimar Germany, Mandate Palestine, or the "heroic pe- riod," as Hannes Meyer called it, of the First and Second Five-Year Plans for a new Soviet Union. Sigfried Giedeon describes the immense exhibition spaces such as the Crystal Palace of 1851 or the Galerie des Ma- chines of 1889 as "embodied structures of the as yet un- formulated aims of the nineteenth century,"26 but these "utilitarian" structures were not waiting to be made mani- fest as architecture. They represented a complete and consummate intention; namely, the propulsion of an in- dustrial economy. And the same intention invested in digital technology is today being met with overwhelming support. What Gideon refers to as the "mercantile classi- cism" of the Columbian Exhibition in Chicago in 1893 suits our contemporary situation. Its sheer size reflected unabashed industrial will and yet the "staff' enveloping its metal framework in neoclassical and Venetian motifs at- tempted to cover up its unrelenting agenda in the hopes of pacifying any aporia that might arise among the populace. So, too, we have "bought into" the inevitability of greater modernization masked in nostalgic antique timbers, and with the promise of accommodation, our "new home" will be forced to suffer the humiliations of subservience. Political scientists Josef Esser and Joachim Hirsch offer a vision of the post-Fordist future that challenges the optimis- tic one Bill Gates would have us endorse. They contend that the information technology and the macroeconomy that the fifth Kondratiev necessitates are not benign. Post- Fordism, as they see it, will strengthen monopolistic regula- tion and governance of the economy. The scaling down and reorientation of the welfare service, the weakening of the trade unions, and the emergence of a new technology sector of privileged workers are, for them, signals of the fi- nal abandonment of the universal or collective principles initiated early in the century.27 While it is true that a good deal of controversy surrounds their prognostications, the "recombinant" architecture that Mitchell is summoning forth in City of Bits and the dreamhouse that Gates is sell- ing in The Road Ahead do not admit to the complex issues of the debate and their significance to an architectural dis- course. Neither Mitchell's nor Gates's projections, for all their speculative wit, suggest a trace of doubt. This, then, returns us to the introductory premise that the "building" enterprise that emerges simultaneously with a burgeoning technology remains blind to its social and moral exigen- cies, busies itself with the making of familiar images, and is therefore incapable of creating a critical architecture. We often find ourselves at the diaries of Leonardo da Vinci happy to point out the first signs of an articulated duality in architecture, but there the breach has not yet been mani- fest and we cannot be certain which precedes which. And so we blame the French, locating the schism that provoked 74</page><page sequence="14">Shamir Zion the alienation of practical science from the art of building in the foundation of the Ecole Polytechnique and the ri- valry that ensued with the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. At this point, we abandon the problem of precedence all together. We now take it for granted that science and art are distinct disciplines though ultimately bound together in architec- ture, but the question of which actually happens first, tech- nology or art, remains critical to an understanding of each and to the discourse within architecture. The typical history of modern architecture, as delivered, for instance, in the writings of Giedion, Reyner Banham, or Leonardo Benevolo, traces its development to the advance- ment in technology during and after the industrial revolu- tion. Frampton refers to "the technical transformations from which modern architecture emerged."'" This assertion that modern architecture was preceded by the industrial applica- tion of scientific and engineering discoveries is further rein- forced in Benevolo's argument that architects had only been granted a conciliatory opportunity to respond to the techno- logical revolution with their benign offerings. This, then, is the chronology that we continue to promote - that tech- nology precedes architecture. But what about works of ar- chitecture that we describe as "visionary"? If it is true they arrive after technological invention and after experimenta- tion on the grandest scales, in what sense are they visionary? Benevolo asserts that the Barcelona Pavilion "offered a sort of theoretical demonstration of modern methods of archi- tectural planning."'" Mies himself affirmed this in his ad- dress to the Illinois Institute of Technology in 1950, stating that "whenever technology reaches its real fulfillment, it transcends into architecture.""' Yet the pavilion is not built exclusively of advanced "state-of-the-art" materials - proto- types ready for industry - nor does it adhere absolutely to modernized industrial techniques. The pavilion's "real ful- fillment" seems to project to something outside of itself and its own time. And it is this projection that suggests we might question the assumed and agreed-upon sequence of events. Perhaps we can invert the timeline in recognizing the Barcelona Pavilion as one of the first modernist works produced at the start of the twentieth century that is antici- patory rather than subsequent. This does not come as a be- lated definition of avant-garde; instead, it is an argument for the notion of a work that is "ahead of its time" in that it foresees or prophesies. There may be moments when archi- tecture reaches it highest fulfillment as a science and an art and in so doing envisions new technology. In Space, Time and Architecture, Giedion observes that there are eight decades between James Watts's seven-story cotton factory built of iron columns and beams in 1801 and William Le Baron Jenney's first iron-framed skyscraper, the Chicago Home Insurance Company, built in 1883. The eighty-year interval that Giedion describes as "between the discovery of an important new principle and its assimilation into every day life," if begun in the years after World War I, would bring us to the present decade." And if we acknowl- edge the visionary language and imagery of neoplasticism and suprematism and the architecture of the Barcelona Pavilion or Lissitzky's Prouns, we find that the path of a similar interval becomes apparent in the correspondences between these modernist works and the digital technology that ubiquitously pervades our "every day life." Maybe these works envisioned today's technology. The Barcelona Pavilion, let us recall, more than providing a theoretical review of nineteenth-century building meth- ods, imagined the inhabitation of abstract space - of antispace - and thereby anticipated the program of virtu- ality and the essence of what would become twenty-first- century cybernetic technology. The pavilion, arriving at least eighty years after the height of the technological in- ventions associated with the industrial revolution (the 75</page><page sequence="15">Sn Ae r&amp;, 2 &amp; a - I i</page><page sequence="16">Shamir Zion manufacture of steel, glass, and the elevator), could offer a level of critique in the use of its forms and construction techniques precisely because of its relative distance from the source of initial industrialization. This is not to imply that Mies offered protest to the manifest destiny of industri- alization; he did not. Nonetheless, the multilayered and ambiguous readings that the building's self-reflexive posture elicited would expose both the brutality and the beauty of modern technology and thus invoke a complex critique that the Crystal Palace, say, could not possibly have attained. Perhaps we should consider the idea that works of architec- ture produced simultaneously with dramatic technological breakthroughs cannot achieve a level of critique nor can they truly imagine the future. Rather, as the modern age has shown us, they tend to revert to previous styles fueled by fundamentally commercially driven intentions. Recent writings on the subject of digital technology and its relationship to architecture by critics such as Michael Heim, researchers such as Meredith Bricken, and even ar- chitects such as Michael Benedikt identify the new notions of space initiated in experimentation with the new tech- nology.12 Their analyses define the dramatic departure of "cyberspace" from "conventional" Renaissance or classical spatial conceptions. In so doing, however, they tend to by- pass the revolutionary transformations in the perceptions of space demonstrated in significant works of modern archi- tecture produced in the first decades of this century. In our investigation of key concepts from contemporary digi- tal technology in juxtaposition to the representational and rhetorical language developed in the experimental labora- tory of modern art and architecture of the 1920s, we have identified corresponding notions of a man/machine inter- face and the striking resemblance of neoplasticist represen- tation to computer navigational graphics. But we have also discovered that while the science of the new technology functions much as the early century modernists would have envisioned, its applications in the actual manifestations and intentions of cyber and contemporary built environments diverge dramatically from the principles of the modernists. This primarily occurs in the shift from an abstract to a realist language, but also in the abandonment of objectivity in the making of things in favor of the subjectification of objects and in the departure from collective social concerns in the interest of individual needs. A two-part proposal has emerged from these findings: One is that modernist works of art and architecture, with the Barcelona Pavilion as our prime example, were prophetic in their anticipation of a quality of space that was atectonic and antispatial, properties that we now ascribe to cyberspace. The other is that the Gates House - ironically, the result of the chairman of Microsoft's Fordist venture at the threshold of a post-Fordist economic revolution - adopts an ornamental idiom preoccupied with sentimental concerns that seem to be at odds with the unsentimental reality of the technology housed within. The peculiar leaps in time that each building as a con- ceptual construct makes, the pavilion forward and the house backward, leave a residue of their trajectory that forms a "cross- ing" in historical space. This crossing is significant in that it represents the essential difference between modernism and modernization - two ideas usually bound in the one definition of the project of the modern. Modernization is the force and will of production and consumption that ultimately excludes and discards those things that do not fulfill a progressive, pro- ductive purpose. Cultural modernity holds critique as essential to affirmation in creation, and as P. Adams Sitney points out, The gradual interiorization of Luther's theology and Descartes' philosophical independence culminated in the 'modern' paradox of Kant's formulation of the mark of an aesthetic object: 'purpo- siveness without purpose.' He recognized that the aesthetic experi- ence was at once radically subjective and fiercely committed to an ideal of universal assent. " 77</page><page sequence="17">assemblage 35 What is the role of an architect at the close of the millen- nium and at the precipice of enormous technological trans- formation? The replacement of the graphite pencil with the laser plotter or that of the wooden model with three-dimen- sional animation are suggestive of relatively small changes to the discipline as a whole; more significant theoretical challenges to the discipline are those posed by the digital medium and the forms of spatial occupation and represen- tation proposed by the program of cyberspace. There is, however, a further issue that arises when we attempt to evaluate the role of architecture at this time and it is ac- companied by a general sense of uneasiness that surpasses even architecture's typical self-inflicted existentialism. Namely, we are accustomed to the idea that technology leads, that its practices, methodologies, and artifacts set the standards for all invention that is to follow. Indoctrination to this consciousness pervades in an abundance of powerful images not the least of which is infamous portrait of John Augustus Roebling standing beside his bridge or the lineage of Gustave Eiffel who translated his own early work in the development of the viaduct into his iconic tower, which more than intimated the building systems that would be identified with the modern era. Le Corbusier's appropriated images of ships, airplanes, and silos have left a lasting im- pression of architecture's indebtedness to the precedent of technology. Our generation has fully expected to follow along this path and it is here that our uneasiness resides. For while historically architecture has embraced and fur- thered "scientific" invention, the prophecies of post- industrial industry seem to exclude the architect's offering. Eiffel's refinement of engineered steel had an implicit con- nection to building technique in the most fundamental sense, but information technology, while in most of our minds inseparable from how we live, as articulated by Ted Turner or Bill Gates seems not to require architectural re- sponse or participation. Consequently, the architect must confront not only the collapse of the heroic modernist manifesto but compete as well with the cyberspaces and spectacles that would displace architecture. All this while taking on an industrial machine and initiating an internal architectural reformation. Yet is it true that architecture must compete? Is it not the case that architecture has, in some instances, fulfilled the very things that digital technology today promises as new and improved? The notion of a "virtual reality," for ex- ample, is actually one that defines best the extraordinary aspects of architecture. Consider the entirely surreal land- scape within the framed garden views of the Katsura pal- ace, the light patterns that cut through the slats and fill a midwestern barn, the infinity of arched columns that re- cede into an "other worldly" realm of orange groves at the Cordoba mosque. How are we to describe the nonphysical experiences that these physical places permit? The certainty with which we today endorse the new tech- nology is symptomatic of the conditions of industrialization and modernization with all their ramifications. Response to modernization must come in the form of a "new modern." To continue the project of architecture we may not be asked to adopt the language of industry, but to operate apart from it. A new architecture will not emerge until doubt, critical reflection, and a commitment other than to commerce, if only for a brief moment, enter in. Notes 1.
