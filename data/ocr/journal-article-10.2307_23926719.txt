<plain_text><page sequence="1">Literature &amp; Theology, Vol. 8. No. 2, June 1994 AFTER CHRISTIANITY: THE TRANSFORMATION OF THEOLOGY! Daphne Hampson (Editor's Note: Written in response to Pamela Anderson, 'After Theology: End or Transformation?' Literature and Theology. 7:1 (1993) 78-86.) I am grateful to the editor of the Journal of Literature &amp; Theology for giving me the opportunity to respond to Pamela Anderson's article on my work. I shall proceed through a close reading of her text. I must thank Pamela Anderson for her courtesy in having shown me a previous version of her article so that I could comment, both in writing and in conversation. I recognise the reflection of some of what I said! Nevertheless I have to say that I still find it to be the case both that Anderson has badly misunderstood what I have to say (see for example the discussion on history below) and that she has forced on my work a distorting grid. I think that others who have read my work may also be under some of the former misapprehensions (if not post-structuralists), so I am glad to be given an opportunity to explain myself. I shall illustrate my points through making use of the very quotations from my work which Anderson herself cites! Anderson states that I wish "a transformation of theology which would make it compatible with feminism".1 Yes indeed; though I find myself immediately wanting to say that I should prefer a minimalist definition of 'feminism', as the equality of men and women, here. I think we must, ethically, move to a situation in which our theology is not the construction of one half of humanity, arising out of a patriarchal setting, and which places the other half in a secondary position. Therefore I think we must move beyond the Christian myth (which I think in any case untenable). Anderson seems to suggest that I want a theology which is predicated upon 'women's experience'. But that is not what I say. A misreading of my position here pervades Anderson's article in subtle ways. I quote myself, quoted by Anderson (78): Whether the quality of women's experience tends to be different, such that they may want to speak of God in other ways than do men, it must be difficult to know ... What I think we can say is that some of the thought forms which have Oxford University Press 1994</page><page sequence="2">2io AFTER CHRISTIANITY developed, not least within feminism, in recent years, may be peculiarly suited to expressing what we mean by God.2 Thus I am not, as Anderson suggests, "essentialist" or separatist. There is no reason why men should not develop ways of thinking which will provide us with conceptual paradigms which will prove useful in theology. But I note that, in fact, within feminism, sophisticated understandings of rela tionality and interesting thinking about the self has emerged in recent years; paradigms which I think we can bring to theology, enabling us the better to conceptualise what it is that God may be. Anderson continues (on the 'essentialism' theme): "Hampson thinks it possible that women's experiences are different from men's and that their perceptivity of God, once freed from a patriarchal religion, may offer new insights for theology" (79). But (see the quotation above) I have precisely said we have no way of knowing whether women's experience is intrinsically different from that of men. I comment (in an intermediate sentence in the course of that quotation, which Anderson also quotes): 'Women have thought their thoughts within the context of a patriarchal society, dominated by a patriarchal religion.' (78)3 It may be that women's greater awareness, for example, of relationality, may owe to the position which they have occupied in society. This is not an 'essentialist' view of women. I leave wide open whether there are biological differences which may influence women's and men's thought: I simply say that we would be foolish to rule this out.4 (Nor do I particularly speak of 'women's perceptivity of God'; but, I repeat, of para digms developed in large part in feminist theory, which may help us to think about perceptivity, and hence also perceptivity of God.) To continue. Anderson quotes me as claiming that: "Whereas Christian feminists want to change the actors in the play, what I want is a different kind of play." This brings us to the definition which I give of Christianity; one which is, I think, not unreasonable. Surely Christians may be said to be those (cf. Theology and Feminism p. 50) "who proclaim Jesus to have been unique"? This is — I must maintain — not a conservative, but rather the widest possible definition as to what it is to be Christian! I cite in its defence Bultmann — perhaps the most radical major theologian of this century. Bultmann in no way thinks in terms of Chalcedonian orthodoxy, yet for him too Jesus is unique. (Jesus is the one who died on the cross, a cross which, while existing in a different sphere to the resurrection — the cross existing in Historie, the resurrection in Geschichte — is tied as closely as possible to that resurrection.) Any form of Christianity must, surely, make reference to Jesus, and not simply as one might refer to Julius Caesar, but as unique. Bultmann, as a consequence of his behef, spent his career exegeting the New Testament! Anderson claims that the form of Christianity which I</page><page sequence="3">DAPHNE HAMPSON 211 believe myself to have shown incompatible with feminism is only a conservat ive Christianity. Surely not? I turn then to Anderson's 'postmodern' challenges. As she says I am not, in Theology and Feminism, concerned with postmodernism. I find the imposi tion of her grid on my work makes for strange distortions! Firsdy she holds that I believe (or that I roughly believe) in "the human subject as an universal rational being"; whereas she, Anderson, proclaims the death of such a subject (79). I am told that Theology and Feminism "slides towards an universal — essentialist — conception of female experience", evidenced by my reference to the work of Nancy Chodorow and Carol Gilligan. But (as I pointed out to Anderson and she now incorporates this in her article) what Chodorow suggests is that female gender identity is socially produced through (Chodorow believes) the fact that, in all known human societies, small children are 'mothered' by women. Gilligan's work (again as I have pointed out to Anderson) is empirical: she finds, in her samples, that women tend to have a relational conception of the self; whereas men tend to place the self in opposition to others. No one has said 'all men and all women'; and Chodorow specifically wishes change to come about through men taking a greater part in 'mothering'. It is Anderson who 'slides' between what I have said and quite unwarranted assumptions. We should be very exact here. Yes it may be that many women, in many societies, do have something in common; caused maybe (I find Chodorow's suggestion good) by the fact that, being the same sex as the basic caretaker, they have not had to differentiate themselves and stand over against her as has the young boy. But it is a long step from believing this, to thinking that "consequently a sense of shared identity could be given to women across lines of race, class and ethnicity" — and I should be cautious about saying any such thing. In some respects I should have thought that I held more in common with men in my own culture, even perhaps with black men who have had a certain control over their lives and choice as to their careers, than I have with say poor black women. This does not mean that I do not in some respects recognise in Alice Walker's The Color Purple (a book I cite) a community between women which bears some resemblance to relations between women in the peace movement in Britain in the 1980s. Thus I totally agree — as I have said to her in correspondence — with Anderson that "becoming a woman simply does not mean acquiring a universal female nature". (Anderson seems surprised at this: "[Hampson herself claims to agree with this]!") What an awful idea it is that one should have to acquire a "universal female nature ...". Personally, as I have said to her, I agree with what Anderson tells me is Kristeva's position, that: "Any individual subject is constituted as a play of differences and meanings which cannot be conceived in an universal sense." I will that we should overcome</page><page sequence="4">212 AFTER CHRISTIANITY the construct of "gender" (as opposed to the difference in sexuality), so that each person shall be free to become him or herself.5 (Chodorow's is an interesting suggestion as to how such an overcoming might be realised!) Secondly with regard to Anderson's postmodern "call for the 'death of history' Here we enter a maze of projections onto my work and misunder standings as to what I have said! As far as I know I don't espouse any particular view of 'history' in my book. All I comment is that we have, surely, since the Enlightenment at least, recognised that there cannot be the kind of particularity which Christians claim (and I think that Christians — this is the implication — must hold to the particularity which they necessarily claim by faith). (We do not for example know of resurrections: if there were to be a resurrection, then it would have to be that there are many such.) I quote myself, quoted by Anderson: I do not myself think, I say, that "God could intervene ... or be revealed through particular events ... or through a particular person" (in a way in which God is not, potentially, available through many events or persons). That is to say, I do not think that there could be a unique revelation in history. I am simply a post-Enlightenment person here — and do not choose to believe something else through faith. I am blessed if I know why it follows that: "Hampson leaves herself open to being read as a liberal feminist who retains the conservative Christian male view of history only to reject it outright." I have absolutely nothing against women who are feminist historians (or men for that matter) pointing out that history is subtle, complex and diverse; that, for example — as has been famously shown — though the Renaissance may have been a time of 'progress' for men, this was by no means so in the case of women. As I say in relation to Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza's work (and I cited this to Anderson and she now refers to it), in so far as Schüssler Fiorenza is working as a historian, wishing to show that the New Testament evidence in regard to women is more complex than is generally recognised, I find nothing in her work to which to take exception. (It is not my particular task in life to be a feminist historian, but it is good that some women are.) No: the problem is that Schüssler Fiorenza's work is deceptive. I quote myself again, quoted by Anderson. If one is Christian, one must, in some way, make reference to Christ. For a feminist, the most obvious way in which to do this (for Christ is a male figure) is to make reference to the earliest community of disciples, particularly the communion of women. It appears to be a clever move to make. It is however to evade the issue as to whether Christianity and feminism are compatible. (82)6 Schüssler Fiorenza's work suggests that she has found a way for women to be feminists and Christians. But she has not actually tackled that issue. My</page><page sequence="5">DAPHNE HAMPSON 213 point that she continues to look to the early years of Christianity (so that the parables, imagery and social relations of those texts and that community become normative in the religion) continues to stand. If one were to tackle the question as to whether Christianity and feminism are compatible one has to ask after the compatibility of feminism with Christology. Schüssler Fiorenza has evaded the theological issue. Again, far from criticising Rosemary Ruether's "attempt to elucidate a thread of'the prophetic-liberating tradition of Biblical faith as a norm through which to criticise the Bible'" (81), I say (Theology and Feminism 27) that, "together with an element of an a priori ethical stance, [it] seems to me to be the best concerted argument [for, for example] the ordination of women". Certainly this "golden thread approach", whereby one critiques the scriptures in terms of the scriptures; or else, taking a principle out of scripture, one now applies it to a new situation not envisaged in the ancient world; is precisely one way in which I used to argue for women's ordination. The problem arises not through a two-stage "golden thread" approach (such as the latter methodology I describe); though it may be that the principle one advocates is not present in scripture — which leads one to think that one should in any case ethically and theologically hold to what I name an 'a priori ethical approach'. The problem arises when there is a simple reading of biblical history as revelatory.7 It is this which invites the theodicy question. Hence my question, quoted by Anderson, of such a stance: "why has history been what it has been and given what history has been what may be said of God's intention in relation to women?". (Viz. — note — I am denying a unified view of 'history' as 'progress' towards some ultimate goal, guided by God; which I should have thought was the "male, conservative" view of history which, according to Anderson, I am supposed to hold?!) As Anderson rightly says of me, I "view with scepticism" Ruether's attempt to collect ancient texts related to women's experience, which Ruether suggests should comprise a new canon. Why? Because I am, precisely, not very interested in "women's experience"! I think that women from the ancient past may be found to have had next to nothing in common with my life-experience now. That is to say I do not have a 'universal' view of female identity! (Again, Anderson cites me as saying, in relation to Schüssler Fiorenza, that I find her idea of the "universal solidarity of sisterhood" far-fetched (82). Exactly).8 Anderson comments: "A counter-response to Hampson could be: shouldn't one endeavour to recognise different women's experiences of God in order to avoid the construction of a God in one's own 20th-century white middle-class ... image?" But such a statement is based on a misunderstanding of my project (see the discussion of 'history' above). I haven't suggested that one should con struct God in "one's own 20th-century white middle-class ... image". (1) I</page><page sequence="6">214 AFTER CHRISTIANITY suggest that, since there can be no particular revelation, which consequently makes those historical events normative, we should start with our experience of God, in our age. But this does not, naturally, rale out drawing on the experience of people in any age or culture. There is nothing that makes me 'ahistorical', as Anderson claims (82). Because one does not think that (as Christians think) there is a particular revelation, one does not thereby become ahistorical! (2) It might be added that (cf. Theology and Feminism pp. 162-69) I am not suggesting that we create God in anyone's image — I want a non anthropomorphic understanding of God. (3) I am not particularly interested in "women's experiences of God", but, I would have hoped, men's too. The extent of Anderson's misunderstanding of my position is revealed by the fact that she seems surprised that I cite Julian of Norwich and Catherine of Genoa (83). But I have never suggested but that, in our attempt to conceptualise what it is that God may be, we should be anything other than eclectic in gathering what we think useful. I cite myself, cited by Anderson: 'There is nothing to prevent our [viz. those who hold to a post-Christian position such as my own] taking up past conceptualisations of God if we wish. But we are not constrained to do so if new thought forms appear more persuasive (83).10 (Unlike what is the case for Christians, I claim, who must necessarily refer to Jesus Christ and to the biblical literature.) Incidentally I equally suggest that the (male) theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher is a useful quarry!11 So Anderson's statement, "perhaps it seems odd in light of what was concluded above concerning the end of history that Hampson does cite Julian of Norwich and Catherine of Genoa — women from the Christian tradition", is topsy turvy. What I hold is that Christianity, as a myth, has been a lens which has shaped people's understanding of God in the West. But this does not mean that some theological statements, by some Christian thinkers, may not seem to us profoundly true. In the course of our correspondence I asked Anderson if she had read Kant, only to discover that she is a Kantian scholar. Just as Kant, I remarked, thinks Christianity to be a myth which has carried human morality, I think it to be a myth which has carried human religious experience. I believe that we must discard the myth and differently conceive the experi ence. But this does not mean that I do not think that that myth has not indeed carried human religious experience in the West. I, for one, should never want to knock that that has been the case. And there is much theology which does not directly pertain to the myth. What poverty if, as Anderson seems to suggest of me, all we had to work with was the experience of a few feminist women living today ... ! As to whether, thirdly, I am "foundationalist" is an interesting question. I had not read Derrida at the time that I wrote Theology and Feminism and, now that I have, I am still unsure as to where I stand in relation to the</page><page sequence="7">DAPHNE HAMPSON 215 critique of foundationalism. I am not however maintaining in Theology and Feminism what Anderson claims of me: "She wants God to remain the real ground of truth and of our connectedness" (83). Anderson gives no quotation from my work to support this.12 I certainly think that God may be present in the relation between persons; but I do not think God per se is connect edness. It is perhaps true that I did confuse the issue in an earher article, 'On Power and Gender', through saying that perhaps God is the "web itself".13 But to say even this is perhaps not necessarily to use 'foundational' language. God (so a theist may claim) may be that other dimension which is caught up with language, communication and all that that Derrida names "the trace". (In a parallel way to what he would say in regard to consciousness and subjectivity.) Perhaps the Julian of Norwich quotation, that God is one "in whom my soul standeth" does sounds foundational; and perhaps that is why I actually prefer — and said in my book I was excited by — the words of Catherine of Genoa "my real me is God". For the latter quotation suggests a God who somehow is not an 'external' monadic entity, 'the centre', an immovable fixed point — a conception which deconstruction may well have taught us to query. Rather might God be diverse, fleeting, or something which (I cite a student of mine from many years back) "comes into being through us". Such a conception is much closer to a postmodern sensibility; and I find myself attracted to it. So whether I am a "metaphysical realist" as is claimed (83) I do not know. The question of the relationship of language to 'reality' is an unanswered, perhaps unanswerable, question. That there is nothing but language is certainly not Derrida's claim.14 The language of 'capturing' our experience of God may be unfortunate: probably I had in mind T. S. Eliot's words that language is a "raid" on the inarticulate. I am certainly not averse to the idea that there is "nothing outside the text", provided by "text" one is very clear that one means (as does Derrida) the whole web of interconnectedness which he calls the trace and not simply language. Yes I am a "metaphysical realist" if by this is simply intended that I think that there must be some evidence for God; that (and Anderson cites me) "for me the word 'God' refers" (83).15 But why — in God's name — should one want to speak of God if one did not think that there was any evidence for God?! To say this however is not to deny the "polysemy" (Anderson p. 83) or ambiguity of language. Incidentally it is precisely that I think that there is empirical evidence for God — I mention in my book the work of the Oxford Religious Experience Research Unit, which I hope provides some bulwark against reductionist critiques of religious experience. Anderson says that my conceptualisation of God "seems to be open to the earlier modern critiques of religion from Kant to Feuerbach, Marx, Nietzsche and Freud" (83). Has she not noticed that I grant this of Schleiermacher's work, mentioning indeed</page><page sequence="8">216 AFTER CHRISTIANITY Feuerbach and Freud, and comment that "I myself would want to bring forward much more empirical evidence for belief . ,.".16 So finally to Anderson's concluding claim that I "offer an univocal reading of Christian male symbolism which remains static and in opposition to a female construct"; her belief that I should "not insist that the core symbolism of Christianity can only be understood in one way if [my] assumptions on language were different"; and hence her contention that "a more radical feminist should be able to challenge the dominant narratives of patriarchy — i.e. the totalising account of history — with the engendering of new hetero geneous narratives and new non-linear interpretations of old narrative" (83—84). There is no reason to think that I offer a univocal reading of Christian symbolism; that I believe that it can be understood in only one way. In my discussion of Christology, I mention Hans-Ruedi Weber's book On a Friday Noon, which, pictorially, shows 'Christ crucified' as depicted by very various cultures. Symbolically this may stand for the variety of Christian behef and interpretation. But every picture in that book is, I note, of a male human being — and necessarily so. As I have said, all Christians must refer back to this human being, and therefore also to the culture in which he lived with its presuppositions concerning men, women and their relations. I am therefore quite unclear as to what these "heterogeneous narratives" could possibly be which do not refer to this history — and yet, it is claimed, are Christian? If on the other hand such 'narratives' (or, to use my vocabulary, attempts to conceptualise God) do not make particular reference to this history and to this man, then Anderson is advocating what I am advocating. Only I would not think that such a theistic position could be called Christian. In conclusion, I find it difficult to be told that my spirituality "seems ... separatist" (84). Of course I discuss separatism in my book: it has been a strand of feminist, indeed Christian feminist, thought, which has been import ant and I want to give it its due. But there is I believe in my book no evidence that I myself am separatist in inclination. Separatism is defined by Anderson as 'a position which sets itself apart in being selectively determined by particular experiences of God' (85). (A rather odd definition.) I would want to maintain that human religious experience — for example awareness of the power of prayer — is (surely) something of which men and women of all generations and belonging to many traditions have been cognisant. We arrive back where we commenced: I am not particularly interested — contrary to what I am told on the first page of Anderson's article — in "women's experience". (It is Anderson who, apparently, wants to look to women in the past, reread their stories etc.) Personally I yearn for a world in which women and men together are free of a myth through which one sex has distorted human relationships: Christianity. I should hate to belong to a separatist, feminist, Christian</page><page sequence="9">DAPHNE HAMPSON 217 movement intent on 'womenchurch'. As the dedication of my book makes clear, I go to a Quaker meeting — the nearest I can come to a group of men and women who, relatively speaking, are free of their Christian origin.

My problem with Ruether is that she seems to collapse this double move and to be prepared to read directly out of scripture; which thus becomes methodologically fundamentalist in relationship to that passage. Indeed at times she seems prepared to speak simply of a liberating message in scripture (in which one could believe as an atheist). Or (as a quasi-Hegelian) to collapse God into history. It is this last which invites the theo dicy question. 8 Theology and Feminism p. 34. The phrase is a citation from Schüssler Fiorenza, In Memory of Her (London, S.C.M., 1983). 9 I thank Anderson for citing Genoa; Sienna in the book is a mistake; this was elucidated in correspondence. 10 Theology and Feminism, p. 171. 11 Theology and Feminism, p. 172. Why Anderson should say of my work (footnote 21), "One dialogues only with those who perceive God through knowledge of ourselves/one's self", I do not know. 12 One might have thought that it is Christians who are perhaps necessarily "foundational" through, for example, their belief in God as creator; and more generally through having a unitary understanding of God, who is an agent in human history. Anderson chides me (84) for not being interested in myths, for example, of creation. 13 Modem Theology 4(3) (April 1988). 14 I have a tape-recording of a discussion with Derrida, following his listening to a paper of mine on his work. Derrida comments, citing me: " 'If the claim, made within deconstruction, that consciousness (or meaning, or God) are an effect of the trace, is to be taken to mean that these things are produced by the trace and are essentially an illusion ...', I would agree to this last part of your ... To say that something is an effect of the trace — God for example ... doesn't mean that its an illu sion." I respond: "No, I hoped it didn't. Because if it does mean that, then it would make my position impossible." Derrida responds: "So would it mine!" 15 Theology and Feminism, p. 170. 16 Theology and Feminism, p. 172.</page></plain_text>
