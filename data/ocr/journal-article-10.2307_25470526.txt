<plain_text><page sequence="1">SCIENCE AND SENSITIVITY: A GEOCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE MAUNA KEA ADZE QUARRY COMPLEX, HAWAII ISLAND, HAWAII Peter R. Mills, Steven P. Lundblad, Jacob G. Smith, Patrick C. McCoy, and Sean P. Naleimaile The Mauna Kea Adze Quarry Complex is the largest-known prehistoric quarry in the Pacific Basin. The main extraction areas are located at an extreme altitude (3,800 m), near the summit of Hawaii's tallest mountain. The Mauna Kea summit region and the quarry are considered by many Hawaiians to be a sacred landscape and archaeologists must consider the ethical tensions involved in conducting Western science in these areas. Although provenance studies of basalt adzes are integral to the examination of pre-contact Hawaiian economics, former studies of Hawaiian adze distribution have been limited in scope, and conventionally relied on destructive petrography and petrology for the analyses. Published geochem ical data on the quarry are derived from only eight samples analyzed with destructive methods. In order to better define the variation within the quarry, and to develop a more culturally sensitive approach, we employed nondestructive energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) of whole-rock samples to characterize 820 flakes and 47 geological samples from the quarry complex. This study offers the first reliable estimation of the overall range of geochemical variability in the com plex. These results suggest that nondestructive EDXRF can be used to differentiate Mauna Kea basalts from other known Hawaiian quarries, but more characterization of other quarries is necessary to confirm exclusive separation of sources. The results further demonstrate that EDXRF is capable of detecting intra-site geochemical variation in Mauna Kea quarry material. La cantera de azuela en Mauna Kea es la cantera prehistorica mds grande en la Cuenca Pacifica. La region principal de extrac cion se situa a una altitud extrema (3800 m), cerca de la cima de la montana mds alta en Hawaii, Mauna Kea. La cima de Mauna Kea y la cantera constituyen un paisaje sagrado de la cultura tradicional de Hawai, y los arqueohgos necesitan con siderar los conflictos eticos al trabajar investigaciones cientifcas en estos sitios. Aunque los estudios sobre el origen de azuela basdltica son integrales para el andlisis de la economia precolombina en Hawaii, los estudios precedentes de la distribucion de azuelas hawaianas han sido limitados en alcance y, de una manera convencional, han sido basados en la petrologia y la petrografia destructiva para sus andlisis. Los datos geoquimicos publicados sobre la cantera se derivan de solamente ocho muestras que han sido analizadas por medio de metodos destructivos. Para definir mejor la variacion geoquimica en la can tera, y para crear un metodo mds sensible a la cultura hawaiana, empleamos la Fluorescencia de Rayos X para la Energia Dispersiva (EDXRF), no destructiva, de 820 lascas y 47 muestras geologicas de la cantera. Este estudio presenta laprimera valoracion solida del alcance posible de la variabilidad geoquimica en la cantera. Los resultados sugieren que la EDXRF no destructiva se puede utilizar para diferenciar el basalto en Mauna Kea de otras canteras hawaianas, y tambien puede detec tar la variacion geoquimica desde dentro de la misma cantera.

Sit uated approximately 400 m lower in elevation is the Mauna Kea Adze Quarry Complex (50-10-53 4136), which is one of the most remarkable pre historic sites in the Pacific (Figure 1). Enormous debitage piles from the manufacture of possibly hundreds of thousands of stone adzes (kosi) are concentrated along several escarpments composed of fine-grained basalts (Figure 2). The quarry is well above elevations that commonly induce altitude sickness, especially in people who live along the coast. Although some quarrying activity extends below the tree-line to 2,740 m, the majority of the complex lies above any readily available food or fuel. Standing at the quarry, one is struck by the extent to which Hawaiians explored their natural environment. It is equally impressive to consider the sophisticated economy that supported this high altitude industry. Despite some early and significant studies of archaeological quarries by William Henry Holmes (1890, 1900, 1919; see also Meltzer and Dunnell 1992), archaeological studies of quarry sites did not achieve prominence until the development of processual approaches to stone tool analysis (Bryan and Tuohy 1960; Ericson and Purdy 1984; Gramly 1980; Ritchie and Gould 1985; Shafer and Hester 1983; Singer and Ericson 1977; Torrence 1986). Many regional studies of lithic technology, politi cal economies, and exchange networks have sus tained archaeological interest in these sites (Arnold 1992; Lepper et al. 2001; Reher 1991; Root 1997; Shackley 2005), and the SAA now sponsors a "Pre historic Quarry and Early Mines" interest group. Processual archaeological interest in Polyne sian stone tool quarries followed similar trends to</page><page sequence="3">REPORTS 745 t. \ &gt; Figure 2.

Following surveys and excavations at the Mauna Kea Adze Quarry in the 1970s, McCoy (1977:236) estimated that the quarry covers over 18 km2, but more recent fieldwork (McCoy 1986, 1991) further expands site boundaries. It is larger than all other known Hawaiian quarries combined. Associated features include a variety of workshops, rockshelters, open-air shelters, shrines, and a few examples of rock art. Twenty-three published radio carbon dates from eight excavation areas within the complex indicate that the quarry may have been in use from A.D. 1100 to approximately A.D. 1800 (McCoy 1990:92). Lass (1994:24) indicates from petrographic analyses that Mauna Kea adzes appear in contexts dating before A.D. 1100, but these find ings are based solely on two sites on the southern part of HawaTi Island (HI, H8) that have been the subjects of much chronological reinterpretation (Cordy 2000:122-124). A central issue in the chronology and develop ment of the Mauna Kea Adze Quarry Complex is its relationship to the development of Hawaii's complex chiefdoms. By the A.D. 1400s, a tradi tional Polynesian land tenure system involving cor porate kin groups had developed into a feudal-like system in the Hawaiian Islands (Cordy 2004; Hom mon 1976). Hereditary chiefs collected tribute from commoners in the feudal system, but most daily necessities were produced within economically self-sufficient land divisions known as ahupua^a (Earle 1977; Sahlins 1992). The structure of ahupuaya limited the need for domestic resource redistribution through the chiefly class, and there were eventually over 600 ahupua^a on the island of Hawafi alone. The Mauna Kea Adze Quarry Complex is located in the single ahupua^a of Kavohe. The size of the quarry, however, leaves little doubt that Hawaiians distributed its products far beyond Kasohe, and this has generated a great deal of dis cussion regarding how it would fit within Hawaii's economic system (Bayman and Nakamura 2001; Cleghorn 1986; Lass 1994, 1998; McCoy 1990, 1991; Williams 1989; Withrow 1990, 1991). The difficulty individuals would have faced in reach ing, working in, and distributing products from this</page><page sequence="4">746 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 73, No. 4,2008] high-elevation quarry indicates organized logisti cal support, either through chiefly sponsorship or through commoner social networks. The complex also was not the only adze production center on Hawafi Island. Smaller formal quarries exist (Cleghorn et al. 1985; Lass 1994:22-23; Tuggle 1976), and domestic sites commonly contain pri mary reduction basalt flakes and adze preforms with cobble cortex, which indicate that many adzes were manufactured from locally available cobbles. These observations negate any potential argument that the high-altitude quarry was developed only because of a lack of more readily available mate rials. Thus, the reason for the existence of the Mauna Kea Adze Quarry Complex must funda mentally lie with cultural preferences rather than environmental determinism (McCoy 1991:25). If initial use of the quarry is correctly dated to the A.D. 1100s, and the transition to the ahupua^a system occurred in the A.D. 1300s or 1400s, then we might expect that the mode of production at the quarry changed as well. Despite broad interest in the Hawaiian Islands as an anthropological case study of complex chiefdoms (Earle 1977; Sahlins 1992), the mechanisms through which Hawaiians produced and distributed commodities such as adzes remain poorly understood (Lass 1994; McCoy 1991:30). Sourcing of Mauna Kea Basalts Our ability to understand the role of the Mauna Kea Adze Quarry Complex in the Hawaiian economy and in the development of Hawaii's complex chief doms hinges on sourcing lithic materials in domes tic assemblages. Dense and fine-grained black basalts are poorly suited for macroscopic identifi cation. In the 1980s and 1990s there were several small-scale sourcing studies in Hawaii that used thin-sections and optical petrography (Cleghorn 1982; Cleghorn et al. 1985; Lass 1994; McCoy 1986:14-15; Withrow 1990, 1991). This destruc tive process requires that artifacts be cut on a rock saw so that a thin slice of the rock can be studied under a microscope. Comparing similarities and differences in thin-sections through this conven tional method is also qualitative, and two different researchers could classify the same thin-sections differently. In the most ambitious petrographic study of Hawaiian adze material, Lass (1994; see also Withrow 1991) analyzed 155 adzes from Hawaivi Island, and assigned samples to the most similar-looking source material in her reference collection. Lass's ability to make meaningful sta tistical comparisons, however, was limited by the size of her representative sample. The development of Hawaii's complex society undoubtedly involved the production and distribution of at least hundreds of thousands of adzes. Sample sizes in the hundreds are simply insufficient to accurately represent such a large and complex economy through time and space. Quantitative and replicable geochemical char acterizations of source materials can overcome some of the limitations of qualitative research. Both destructive and nondestructive geochemical tech niques such as Wavelength dispersive X-ray fluo rescence (WDXRF), energy-dispersive X-Ray fluorescence (EDXRF), instrumental neutron acti vation analysis (INAA), and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) have now become widely and successfully used in the Pacific (Best 1984; Collerson and Weisler 2007; Johnson et al. 2007; Lebo and Johnson 2007; Rolett 1998; Walter 1998; Walter and Sheppard 1996; Weisler 1990,1993,1997,1998; Weisler and Clague 1998; Weisler and Kirch 1996; Weisler and Woodhead 1995; Williams 2002; Winterhoff 2003). Although many of these studies have focused on more homo geneous volcanic glasses, there have been some successful geochemical studies of basalts and andesites in the Pacific and on the American con tinent (Collerson and Weisler 2007; Johnson et al. 2007; Jones et al. 1997; Latham et al. 1992; North west Obsidian Research Laboratory 2006; Walter 1998; Weisler and Kirch 1996). Craig Skinner and colleagues at the Northwest Research Obsidian Studies Laboratory (NROSL) list 69 XRF studies of archaeological basalt conducted between 1995 and 2006. In the most comprehensive geochemi cal study of Hawaiian Island basalt quarries to date, Sinton and Sinoto (1997) published data garnered from destructive WDXRF analyses of 12 known basalt quarries throughout the archipelago as part of a Pacific-wide survey. That data set, however, only included 58 samples from all the known Hawaiian quarries. Sinton and Sinoto's own assess ment was that these data are far too limited to iden tify the ranges of geochemical variability in each quarry. For example, the geochemistry of the</page><page sequence="5">REPORTS 747 sprawling Mauna Kea Adze Quarry Complex was derived from eight samples for major elements and only two samples for trace elements (Sinton and Sinoto 1997:200). In sum, the limited sampling in quarries, and in domestic assemblages, has severely limited our understanding of the distribution pat terns of Hawaiian adzes. Ethical Considerations Archaeological ethics are particularly pertinent to investigations of the Mauna Kea Adze Quarry Com plex because of the cultural significance of the land scape in which it exists (Maly 1999). Numerous shrines are present (McCoy 1990, 1999), and in 1862 a 1.5 m tall wooden anthropomorphic statue (often associated with Hawaiian ritual sites) was collected from in front of one of the rockshelters there (McCoy 1990:99; Maly and Maly 2005: 18-19). These site features, in combination with the ancestral associations of the summit region with Papa, Wakea, and Polivahu, make our juxtaposition of the profane and industrialized word "quarry" over the Hawaiian landscape rather inadequate as a defining term for the complex. This kind of semantic problem of translating concepts from col onized cultures into the languages of the coloniz ers is pervasive in anthropology (Kane 1997:265), and greatly affects our implicit ideas about the cul tural significance of the places that we study. Through the second half of the twentieth cen tury, Mauna Kea's summit has become a hotly con tested cultural landscape. Development for astronomical research continues amid strong protests from Hawaiian cultural practitioners. When the quarry is contextualized within this con tested landscape, it is important to recognize that destructive archaeological research on the site read ily can be perceived as an additional intrusion of Western science in a sacred realm. Cultural tensions between colonizers and indigenous peoples often lead to amplified dichotomies between Western science and Native spiritualism that do not adequately reflect the iden tities and commonalities on either side of the cul tural divide. There are numerous examples of pre-European Hawaiians using rigorous science. These include the development of sophisticated open-ocean voyaging techniques, medicinal uses of plants, and the extensive geological observa tions that Hawaiians must have conducted to locate high-quality adze material. In this study, we have attempted to apply scientific methodologies that are more culturally sensitive to these commonalities. The duality of the concept of "sensitivity," however, when dealing with science and culture, can often create conflict. It should therefore not solely be the scientific community that decides what is sensitive science and what is not. The research contained herein involved over a year of consultation with Native Hawaiian community members to establish a protocol on how the project should be conducted, if at all. Details of the consultation process are pre sented below, and additional information can be found in Mills and Lundblad (2006:11-12). When the SAA Ethics in Archaeology Com mittee began redrafting its principles in the 1990s, the idea of "stewardship" was the first of the prin ciples discussed (Lynott and Wylie 1995:23, 28-32). That principle involved the long-term con servation and preservation of the archaeological record, which specifically includes archaeological collections (see also Kintigh 1996). The Smith sonian Institution's guidelines for sampling are even more explicit: "The analytical methods pro posed should yield the intended results, and are the least intrusive analytical means of obtaining those results" (Smithsonian Institution 2007). It is very likely that there will be many instances when destructive analytical techniques will be required to discriminate between sources, but it is impera tive from an ethical standpoint that we determine the parameters of what can be achieved with non destructive approaches before considering destruc tive approaches. We report on the first large-scale attempt to use nondestructive energy-dispersive X-ray fluores cence (EDXRF) to characterize archaeological basalts in the Hawaiian Islands. EDXRF spec trometers have been improved considerably since the 1980s, and can rapidly generate broad-spectrum geochemical analyses with levels of precision in the parts per million range for certain elements. In addi tion to EDXRF's analytical capacity to be con ducted nondestructively, spectrometers are relatively easy to maintain, making them suited for undergraduate use. The authors have been work ing with undergraduate and graduate students (many of Pacific Islander descent) in the hope that they will be able to embrace such nondestructive</page><page sequence="6">748 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 73, No. 4,2008] Mauna Kea Adze Quarry / 4'000 mi x Sampling Locations \ ) Geological Samples / Summit J -f- Archaeological Samples \__ 4,205 mi / 0 _lkm Lake c;.} ,./ HbHbH Waiauk. / -' . &gt;! /. | / Zone 1 \ / / 28 20 V p/ ^ Zone 2 7H// N&lt; Zone 3 # / 3t000 Figure 3.

Ongoing projects by people of indigenous ancestry are re-examining museum collections gathered throughout the archipelago, including the Northwest Hawaiian Islands. Students have pre sented their findings at annual meetings of the Soci ety for Hawaiian Archaeology. Dissertations and several publications pertaining to this student research are forthcoming. Geology of the Mauna Kea Adze Quarry Complex The most recent geological mapping of the Mauna Kea Adze Quarry Complex places the quarried material within the post-shield Liloe Spring vol canic member of the Hamakua volcanic series (Wolfe et al. 1997:34-40). Because it is an evolved post-shield lava, it is compositionally distinct from the tholeiitic shield-building lavas of Kilauea and Mauna Loa that cover more than half of Hawafi Island (Figure 1). Wolfe et al. (1997:38-39) date the Liloe Spring member between 150,000 and 70,000 years ago, and identify the main escarp ments quarried by Hawaiians as a possible sub glacial fissure ridge surrounding Puvu Kovokovolau. McCoy (1990:93) refers to this por tion of the quarry complex as "production zone 1" (Figure 3). Each production zone is based on gross differences in raw material sources and selected raw material properties within each source. Ear lier, Porter (1987:93) had interpreted the escarp ments as the leading edge of a subglacial eruption of Puvu Waiau, which is nearer to the summit. Wolfe et al. reject Porter's interpretation, however, due to the different geochemistry of the more hawaiitie Pusu Waiau flow. The Liloe Spring vol canic member is quite diverse. Prominent plagio clase phenocry sts occur in many dense basalt flows in the eastern portion of the quarry that are lack ing elsewhere, and dikes (Wolfe et al. 1997:38), palagonite, welded tuff, and many other separate eruptive events are present in the quarry complex.</page><page sequence="7">REPORTS 749 Separate eruption events could have affected the range of geochemistry within extraction areas, and the geological features are too poorly dated to assume that they were all produced in a single short-lived eruption. Wolfe and colleagues' published data do not include trace-element composition, which is the most significant group of elements for discerning stone sources using EDXRF. They do, however, note the work of Frey et al. (1990), who found that strontium (Sr) is an excellent indicator of the dif ference between Hamakua lavas, including the Liloe Spring series, and more recent lavas on Mauna Kea such as the Puvu Waiau eruption. Liloe Spring series volcanics continue well beyond the current boundaries of the Mauna Kea Adze Quarry, and major exposures exist in Pohakuloa Gulch and Waikahalulu Gulch in what McCoy refers to as Zones 2 and 3 of the complex, where additional chipping debris and some extraction activities have been identified (McCoy 1986, 1990:93). McCoy's Zone 2 begins directly below the main escarpments (1990:93). Glacial drift deposits cover much of the Liloe Spring flows in this area, but bedrock protrudes in "whaleback ridges." In many cases, boulders of adze-quality basalt are in the glacial drift, dispersed in outwash plains and moraines. These drift deposits are part of the Makanaka glacial member, dated between 40,000 and 13,000 years ago (Wolfe et al. 1997:53-56), and there is ample evidence that Hawaiian crafts people opportunistically quarried adze-quality material from the glacial deposits. Lower still in the quarry complex (McCoy's Zone 3), the Makanaka glacial deposits are inter spersed with older moraines and outwash deposits of the Waihu glacial member. The Waihu glacial member is roughly contemporaneous with the Liloe Spring volcanics (Wolfe et al. 1997:22), and Waihu glacial deposits appear in lenses within the Liloe Spring volcanics in Zone 3. Again, McCoy (1990:93) has identified adze quality material in this zone, both as glacial outwash, and in "patches" of varying quality. Confounding Variables Several factors might induce archaeometrists to be skeptical of the ability of nondestructive EDXRF to discriminate between Hawaiian basalts. Unlike continental basalts, andesites, and felsites that have been successfully differentiated (Hermes and Ritchie 1997; Latham et al. 1992; Northwest Research Obsidian Studies Laboratory 2006), vir tually all of the basalt in the Hawaiian Islands is derived from the same source?a deep magma plume underneath the Pacific tectonic plate. This factor does indeed limit overall variation in basalt geochemistry throughout the archipelago, but as shield volcanoes evolve, the magma is altered as it interacts with the lithosphere. The ongoing Puvu vOvo eruption on Kilauea Volcano offers an opti mistic analogy. Kilauea Volcano is still in an early shield-building stage, and these basalts tend to be more geochemically similar than evolved post shield basalts, such as those at the Mauna Kea Quarry. Nevertheless, during the first 15 years of the ongoing Puvu vOvo-Kupanaha eruption at Kilauea, Mid-Z trace elements (Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, and Nb), showed measurable variation in concentra tions (Garcia et al. 1992, 2000). This kind of vari ation indicates the potential to differentiate Hawaiian basalts from the same source, even if they are from shield-building phases, and from vir tually contemporaneous eruptions in geologic time. A second potentially confounding factor is that when compared with obsidian, which has been suc cessfully studied with EDXRF in many contexts (Eerkens et al. 2007; Shackley 1998,2005), basalt is more heterogeneous, and is consequently diffi cult to characterize by analyzing a single spot on an artifact. This factor makes the characterization of a basalt source from a small number of analy ses more unreliable. By increasing sample sizes, however, it should be possible to address the range of variability encountered in any particular source. The loss of some precision with nondestructive analyses can also quickly be offset by more rapid sample preparation and processing associated with nondestructive EDXRF. Other confounding fac tors such as sample thickness, shape, and chemi cal weathering need to be considered in nondestructive analyses (Lundblad et al., 2008; Weisler 1993:74), but as we present below, non destructive analyses offer great promise in differ entiating Mauna Kea Adze Quarry basalts from other major quarries. Only after more extensive sampling of all the major quarries, however, will it be possible to determine whether or not major sources remain entirely distinguishable with non destructive EDXRF.</page><page sequence="8">750 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 73, No. 4,2008] Methods Two classes of lithic material were sampled from the quarry complex. The first group consisted of 820 flakes obtained from the Bishop Museum, dur ing the 1975 and 1976 excavations (Sites 2,7, 11, and 14, Figure 3). The samples were selected from four separate rockshelter excavations located in Zones 1, 2, and 3 of the complex (Cleghorn 1982; McCoy 1990; Williams 1989). The samples repre sent a total of 24 different stratigraphic levels within the four different rockshelter workshops. This sam pling maximized our geographic coverage of the quarry complex and controlled for potential chrono logical changes in the types of material that had been quarried. By nondestructively analyzing deb itage as opposed to remnant geological exposures, we could build a database from materials that Hawaiians themselves had chosen, as opposed to analyzing rocks that they had left behind in out crops. A limitation of this data set, however, is that it was impossible to determine from which loca tion within the quarry complex each flake had been quarried. In order to determine the distribution of potential intra-site geochemical variability, we also collected 47 geological samples from 12 sites in Zones 1 and 2, as well as two additional samples from bedrock in Pohakuloa Gulch on the north eastern edge of the complex (Figure 3). In consul tation with interested Native Hawaiian cultural practitioners, and following a protocol developed in conjunction with them, we collected 47 unaltered rock samples of less than 1 kg each. We docu mented sample locations with GPS coordinates and before-and-after photos (Mills and Lundblad 2006:13). Although our research was not consid ered a federal undertaking, our consultation process followed an established Section 106 consultation process for prior federal undertakings in the sum mit region of Mauna Kea. We contacted individu als and organizations who had been recognized as interested parties for other projects near the sum mit. Our collection procedure evolved in discus sions with these individuals and organizations as a balance between the scientific value of extensive geological sampling and the cultural value of min imizing impacts to the quarry. While some may argue that a greater number of samples would be preferable, we nevertheless were able to sample all the known outcrops containing primary extraction areas in the complex. Analyses of these combined 867 whole-rock samples (artifacts and geological specimens) were completed on a QuanX EDXRF spectrometer with an extended sample chamber, using a rhodium (Rh) stable-isotope X-ray tube, thermoelectrically cooled detector, and supporting Edmunds vacuum pump. Data were processed on Wintrace soft ware, version 3.1, build 33. UH Hilo's EDXRF spectrometer also has a customized sample cham ber that accommodates large artifacts such as adze blanks, poi pounders and stone bowls. Conducting EDXRF analyses involves using variable X-ray energies to quantitatively analyze different elements. By varying the kinds of X-rays produced, one can optimize the fluorescence of particular elements of analytical interest. We ana lyzed a suite of 17 elements using a methodology that is fully described in Lundblad et al. (2008). Certain trace elements in basalt, particularly rubid ium (Rb), strontium (Sr), yttrium (Y), zirconium (Zr), and niobium (Nb), exhibit the best analytical precision with EDXRF, while the data for major elements is less precise. Until further research is completed on major element analyses with nonde structive EDXRF, we consider our major-element data to be partially quantitative. We analyzed the 820 archaeological flakes by placing the flattest noncortical surfaces over the X-Ray beam. The geological samples were analyzed on flat interior polished surfaces. Each sample run included the analysis of a known geological standard prepared by the USGS from a basalt source in Kilauea Caldera (BHVO-2). In order for EDXRF spectrometers to conduct quantitative analyses, the spectrometers also need to be calibrated by analyzing similar geological reference standards that contain well-established concentrations of elements. The UH Hilo spec trometer has been calibrated for the analysis of basalt with 27 geological standards. They include 12 USGS standards (AGV-2, BCR-1, BCR-2, BHVO-1, BHVO-2, BIR-1, DNC-1, DTS-2, GSP 2, QLO-1, STM-1, W-2), 12 Geological Survey of Canada standards (LKSD 1-4; FER 1-4; TILL 1 4), two basalt standards from the Geological Sur vey of Japan (JB-2, JB-3), and one Geological Survey of China basalt standard (NCS DC 73303).

Ratios, how ever, can also obfuscate real quantitative differences in sources if in fact elemental concentrations covary, and the amount of error introduced from minor sur face irregularities, such as a flaked basalt adze sur face, have been insignificant (Lundblad et al. 2008). Consequently, we have attempted to conduct initial characterization of sources with elemental concen trations rather than ratios. Results Full geochemical datasets for all 17 analyzed ele ments are available online (UH Hilo Geoarchaeol ogy Lab 2007). In Figure 4, the trace-element concentrations of Sr and Zr for the 820 analyzed archaeological flakes are compared to the prelim inary Hawaiian quarry data published by Sinton and Sinoto (1997:200). These two trace elements appear to be the best discriminators for Hawaiian basalt samples when using EDXRF, both because of the higher precision and accuracy of our cali brations for these elements, and because there are concentrations of Sr and Zr in Hawaiian basalts that fall well above the detection limits of the spec trometer. Although multivariate statistical methods can offer more powerful tools for discriminating between data sets involving 17 elemental variables, we have found that Sr and Zr concentrations pro vide an excellent initial sorting of Hawaiian basalts, and in this case, the bivariate analysis has proven more effective than Principal Components Analy sis (PCA). Overall, the scatter-plot demonstrates a consistent cluster for the Mauna Kea Quarry mate rial with the greatest concentration offtakes falling between 530-600 ppm for Sr, and 290-340 ppm for Zr. These concentrations remain unique rela tive to data collected to date from other Hawaiian quarries (Sinton and Sinoto 1997:20). Several quar ries on Molokavi and one quarry on Kahovolawe (the Puvumoiwi quarry) are somewhat similar to the Mauna Kea samples, and it may be that some over lap between these major quarries will occur for the Sr and Zr plots as more samples from the other quarries are processed. The 15 other measured ele ments, however, offer possibilities for discriminat ing these sources, especially when multivariate statistical analyses similar to those used to dis criminate other closely related lithic sources (Glas cock et al. 1998; Johnson et al. 2007) are applied to any overlapping data sets. No significant variation in assemblage geo chemistry was noted between the stratigraphic lay ers sampled in each rockshelter (Table 1). Based on Sr and Zr concentrations, and indeed the entire range of elements analyzed, the detected differ ences from the rockshelters are also too small to allow for the diagnostic determination of single flakes to certain rockshelter assemblages, even with multivariate statistics. There is, however, a statis tically significant increase (t-test, p &lt; .01) in zir conium (Zr) concentrations for Kovokovolau rockshelter #1, Site 14 (a designation from the 1970s Bishop Museum fieldwork) when compared with the three other assemblages. This difference is most likely due to geochemical variability in the flows surrounding the rockshelters. Because Hawaiians could have also transported material from one portion of the quarry to another before reducing blocks of raw material into adze blanks, the range of variability in a workshop assemblage may be greater than what is observed in flows immediately surrounding each workshop. Geological Samples Table 2 lists the trace-element concentrations for 47 geological samples obtained from the quarry</page><page sequence="10">752 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 73, No. 4,2008] complex. University of Hawaii at Hilo (UHH) sam ple designations refer to the site of origin followed by a letter designation to identify each sample. The exceptions to this system are two samples obtained from the western edge of the site complex in Pohakuloa Gulch (UHH PKG 1, UHH PKG 2) where there was no observed quarrying activity. A full description of the sample collection procedure can be found in Mills and Lundblad (2006). Five geochemical outliers in Table 2 are indi cated by asterisks. All five of these samples were collected from quarry areas where there was no immediate evidence of quarrying (UHH PKG 1 and 2, UHH 13A, UHH 14L, and UHH 14VG). Three outliers that appear to be Liloe Spring mem bers like the preferred basalt at the quarry are a vol canic glass sample (UHH 14VG), and two basalts (UHH 13A, UHH PKG 2). Samples UHH PKG 1 and UHH 14 L are the most divergent, and reflect geochemistry consistent with Laupahoehoe vol canics as defined by Frey et al. (1990). The sam ple UHH PKG1 was collected from the capstone flow on the eastern edge of Pohakuloa Gulch, and UHH 14L was collected from a ridge north of the main extraction area, which was mapped by Wolfe et al. (1997) as part of the Puvu Waiau flow (Lau pahoehoe volcanics). Standard deviations were calculated for each of the trace elements, excluding the five outliers men tioned above. It is significant to note that the stan dard deviation for Zr is 19 ppm. For comparison, 98 runs of the geological standard BHVO-2, con ducted concurrently with the archaeological and geological samples, resulted in a standard devia tion of 2.6 ppm. All standard deviations for trace elements for BHVO-2 are significantly lower than what was measured for the geological samples. Given that both the BHVO-2 pellet and the geo logical samples were analyzed on flat homoge neous surfaces, the differences in standard deviations, especially for Zr, cannot be attributed to surface topography or weathering, and appear to reflect intra-site differences in geochemical com position within the adze quarry. These data indi cate that Zr concentrations could be used to identify intra-site variation. In contrast, although Sr proved to be an excellent discriminator for inter archipelago variation in basalts (Figure 4), the range of variation for Sr within the quarry is only slightly above that noted for our geological standard. Figure 5 illustrates the measured concentrations of Sr and Zr for the 44 basalt samples that fall in the main geochemical cluster (excluding UHH14L, 14VG, and PKG 1). Samples from the same sites tend to be closely related within the scatter-plot. Similar to the Bishop Museum flake samples, Site 14 specimens, combined with samples directly down slope from Site 14 (Sites 3, 5, 15, and 20), have elevated Zr concentrations relative to other sites. Discussion The ethical principles of the SAA, and most museum collection sampling guidelines, support using the least destructive analytical method to answer posed research questions. Eerkens et al. (2007) have recently demonstrated the applicabil ity of INAA over XRF when studying microdeb itage, and destructive techniques that yield higher precision than EDXRF may be needed to discrim inate between certain closely related sources. Collerson and Weisler (2007), for example, make a strong argument for the value of isotopic analy ses with ICP-MS when one is attempting to con clusively determine the sources of basalts involved in pan-Pacific voyaging. This study raises the bar, however, on the need to resort to destructive analy ses of Hawaiian basalts in archaeological contexts when considering exchange patterns at the level of islands and archipelagos. We demonstrate that (1) nondestructive EDXRF is capable of discriminat ing between Mauna Kea Adze Quarry basalts and other major basalt sources on Hawaii Island, and (2) EDXRF can detect intra-site variability in Mauna Kea Adze Quarry basalts. Geochemical results from various rockshelter assemblages and from geological samples both demonstrate geo graphically patterned differences in trace-element concentrations across the quarry complex, partic ularly for zirconium (Zr). Intra-site variability in the complex could be employed to address whether or not access to specific portions of the quarry was socially regulated. Site 14 is the highest part of the quarry, it is the most intensively exploited, and it appears to have had some of the best quality mate rial within the complex. Because the geochemistry of the raw material there is slightly different, we may be able to address whether or not that portion of the quarry was reserved for elite use.</page><page sequence="11">REPORTS 753 Table 2.

This factor will be most relevant to research on coastal gulches and out crops on Hawafi Island where Hamakua volcanics (of which the Liloe Springs volcanic member that composes the quarry complex is a part) cover most of the shorelines along the eastern and northern slopes of Mauna Kea. Hawaivi Island adzes were undoubtedly taken on voyages to other islands, and possibly other archipelagoes or continents. Collerson and Weisler (2007) have demonstrated this with the discovery of a single Hawaiian adze in the Tuamoto archi pelago. EDXRF has already been employed to identify inter-archipelago movement of basalt in other parts of Polynesia (Weisler 1998; Weisler and Kirch 1996), and should prove useful in Hawaii by identifying anomalous samples that do not match well with local geochemistry. As Weisler (1993) demonstrates, however, Oceanic basalts often do have a great deal of similarity in some instances, and more time-consuming isotopic analyses may be used as a second sampling tier, following EDXRF sampling, to determine whether or not par ticular samples originated in other archipelagoes. Continued applications of EDXRF on debitage in domestic sites will also greatly enrich our under standing of changing patterns in lithic procurement. Broad-scale changes in the acquisition of natural resources in Polynesia should correlate with the evolution of island political economies. As debitage and adzes from dated stratigraphic contexts in domestic sites are linked to the adze quarry, it will be possible both to test the dates inferred from the quarry rockshelters and to quantify the relative intensity with which material from the quarry was being used in any particular location and era. A related research question has been the timing of abandonment of the quarry in the historical era, as iron adzes began to replace stone tools (Bayman 2003; McCoy 1990:92-93). By approaching these issues through nonde structive, low-cost, and large-scale sampling, EDXRF brings "the power of plenty" to prove nance studies in an ethically sound archaeometric approach. Ahler (1989) made the case for mass analyses of flaking debris by arguing that one can learn a great deal by studying the forest instead of the tree. An analogous argument is made here with lithic geochemistry. Large-scale sampling will address in much finer detail some of the ongoing debates regarding chiefly support of craft special ists, and related structures of the Hawaiian politi cal economy (Lass 1998; McCoy 1990, 1991). A diachronic model of Hawaiian economics is imper ative if we are to understand how Hawaiian culture changed from the relatively small founding popu lations at the time of initial settlement, to the com plex chief doms that Captain James Cook observed in 1778. Hawaii's population in 1778 had reached several hundred thousand people by the lowest esti mates and nearly a million by the highest estimates (Kirch and Rallu 2007; Stannard 1989). The mas sive growth of Hawaii's population from the time of initial settlement, by definition, would have involved drastic changes in the exploitation of Hawaii's natural resources. These changes must have resulted in a general pattern of economic intensification, accompanied by changes in land tenure and sociopolitical organization (Cordy 2004; Hommon 1976; Sahlins 1992). There could also be fluctuations in use of the quarry associated with these developments, caused by stresses such as warfare and famine that may not otherwise be apparent. Quantifiable data on the history of quarry use, and changing patterns in the distribution of that material, thus serve as proxies for understanding population dynamics, political change, and land tenure accompanying the evolution of one of the most complex societies in the Pacific.
