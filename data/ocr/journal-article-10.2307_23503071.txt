<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON FAITH AND REVELATION IN THE BIBLE HERBERT C. BRICHTO Hebrew Union College - Jewish Institute of Religion, Cincinnati '־l^HE concern of this paper is a selective exploration of divine A revelation and human faith and the relationship between the two phenomena as recorded in the Bible. The confessedly eclectic nature of the exploration is determined on the one hand by the variegated character and sundry sources of the biblical material, and on the other by the explorer's interest in the relevance of the biblical view for his own time. The latter consideration, especially, inviting as it does the charge of subjectivity, dictates the wisdom of a few prefatory remarks; for while to disclaim all subjectivity is foolhardy conceit, an acknowledgement of inevitable bias is not to be equated with caprice and thus foreclose all legitimate claims to objective validity. What are the chief difficulties incidental to our enterprise? First and foremost, language itself. The rise and development of the dis cipline of semantics in itself underscores the problem of communication of ideas in any given tongue. Our two terms, faith and revelation, are cases in point. The ambiguities of the latter term, the ranges of mean ing assigned to it, are almost too well known to require comment. The biblical terms most closely corresponding to the English are the nif'alnif'al conjugations of the verbs râ'â and gâlâ. But the concept of the Deity revealing Himself or His will to man is understood to be ex pressed in a wide variety of terms, such as the Deity appearing as the subject of the verbs 'âmar, dibber, qârâ or bâ' (in a dream) ; or the impersonal d'var YHWH, ne'um YHWH and yad YHWH■, or, the recipient of the revelation as subject of the verbs râ'â, frâzâ, shâma', etc. Exegetes and commentators have wearied themselves in the attempt to discern correspondences and differences, kinds and degrees of revelation, and have in the process enriched the vocabulary, if they have not clarified the concept, of "revelation." Yet even the term "faith," whose semantic range offers far less difficulty than "revelation," is elusive. Is faith a mental state, and essentially private at that, known only to the believer and God — in which case its very connotation is questionable and one man's faith may be another's lack of it? Or is faith more than an internal, private and passive 35</page><page sequence="2">[2][2] 36 HERBERT C. BRICHTO state — are there conditions for its existence, such as acts of avowal or obedience, which render it essentially public, recognizable by others? A second problem, far more complex than that of translation (assuming that we can be reasonably successful in finding equivalents for the terms of another language), is the task of interpretation. Interpretation, which means first divining the intent of the author — if not, as well, the process by which a tradition which was the property of succeeding generations was transmitted to be congealed in the author's formulation. Does the author intend to present us with a historic event, a philosophic myth, a homely fable, a poetic theological extravaganza — or any, or some, or all of these — or something else again? The simple question as to whether a narrative is to be taken literally is often quite beside the point. The story of the lass who counted her chickens before they were hatched is a fable expressing folk-wisdom. But it could with a slight addition be given a theological twist, and it may have had its origin in an actual incident. . . Compounding the problem of interpretation is the factor of dis tance in time. If communication between members of two con temporaneous societies presents difficulties, how much more so is it the case when millennia separate speaker and listener. And worse yet, when the two are related as spiritual progenitor and descendant and the message of the former reaches the latter through inter mediaries who have adorned it with their own traditions and in terpretations. In regard to sacred literature, in particular, two stances are evidenced among our own contemporaries, both characterized by the assumption of a radical difference between the capacities of the ancient author and those of modern man. The one assigns to the an cients unique faculties and endowments (such as the gift of prophecy and the boon of revelation) which later generations must hold in awe but to which they may not hope to aspire. The other, reversing the priorities of virtue, preens itself on its superior science and en larged learning and views the ancients with the affectionate con descension of the mature adult to his childhood nurse. Both tend to assume that the communication was meant to be taken literally. The former accepts as miraculous but true an event, whose credibility he would question if related by his own contemporary, on the strength of the past being the age of wonders. The latter denies the historicity of an event incredible in terms of his own experience, but assumes that ancient generations, gullible and naive, were able to give it credence at face value. Attempts to read the communication as allegory or the like he views as suspect: they are "rationalizations" — the desperate attempts of "believers" to salvage a tradition which they find in</page><page sequence="3">[3] ON FAITH AND REVELATION IN THE BIBLE 37 tellectually embarrassing. And this distrust is based not so much on the misguided motives of the "rationalizers" as on his own prejudiced assumption about the naiveté of the ancients. Indeed, the more pro found the meaning of a non-literal interpretation, the less credible the notion that this could have been the intent of the communication: the ancients could not have been so "sophisticated." The element of petitio principii in the latter argument is as easily discerned as it is frequently ignored. For, like some other fallacies of logic, the fallacy of circular reasoning lies only in that the argument is not advanced. The argument, however, is not formally contradicted, and the a priori assumption retains its weight in the mind of the reasoner. Here then is the crux of our problem and the obligation of the writer to make his own presumptions clear. Our view begins with a hard disjunction. Either we share a universe of discourse with the ancients or we do not. If we do not, we would be more consistent with ourselves and more respectful of the ancients if we abandoned the study of their literature altogether. If we do share a universe of discourse, then it is part of our task to ascertain what the elements are that we hold in common, and what are the differing ways in which those elements may be expressed by them, by us, by both. Elements of advanced technology or scientific theory whose introduction into the world we can confidently trace to a time and place subsequent to and remote from that of the ancients we may presume not to have been known to them unless we find evidence to the contrary. But the canons of logic, a sense of humor, the subtleties of rhetoric — such as, for example, satirical or ironic expression — these we may not deny them ab initio as beyond their level of sophistication. Nor may we summarily rule out the possibility, nor even the likelihood, that an ancient author may have formulated a message in such a way as to be addressed simultaneously to the most naive and the most sophisticated of his generation, to be comprehended by each according to his level. That Gulliver's Gulliver's Travels is read by children as naive fantasy leads no one to exclude a deeper, more serious intent on the author's part. It is not the reputation of the biblical authors but our own understanding of them that suffers when we arbitrarily accord them less of a hearing than we grant Jonathan Swift. In Chapter 16 of II Samuel, David is pictured in an ignominious re treat from Jerusalem before the advance of his rebel son Absalom. Shimei ben Gera of the family of Saul chooses this moment for a</page><page sequence="4">[4] 38 HERBERT C. BRICHTO vituperative denunciation. David, he proclaims, is a usurper who has murdered the sons of the king he has supplanted, and his present plight is divinely ordained retribution for his crimes. When Abishai proposes to kill Shimei for this act of lese majesty, David's response is that the proposal is inimical to himself,1 Shimei may proceed with impunity for— YHWH 'âmar lô qallel 'eth Dâwîd — "the Lord has said to him: 'Denounce David!' "2 How are we to understand this passage? When and in what manner did the Lord convey his bidding to Shimei — in a prophetic trance, in a dream by night or through the mediation of a prophet? And if by one of these, how did David become privy to this message when Abishai, his general, did not? I submit that the Lord never spoke to Shimei, neither directly nor indirectly. Nor was it in David's mind to claim for Shimei a divine 1 David's rejection of the proposal, treating it as though it has the support of Joab, Abishai's brother, is expressed in the terse mâ It w'ldkhem benë s'-rûyà, literally "What to me and to you, 0 sons of Zeruiah," which is usually rendered, "What have I to do with you." Although this is the sense of mâ w'l- in II Kings 3:13• 9:18, 19, it is not the sense here or elsewhere. The sense is: What is the bone of contention between us — What have you against me? (Cf. Mesudath David on these passages.) Thus in Judg. 11:12 Jepthah addresses the king of the Ammonites, asking him to indicate the casus belli־, "mâ It wâlâkh that you come against me to make war upon my country?" What David is saying is that the counsel to kill Shimei might well come from an enemy for it can only bring down the wrath of Heaven. This sense is made explicit in II Sam. 19:23, when after the defeat of Absalom, Abishai having again proposed death for the now penitent Shimei, David responds, "mâ It w'iâkhemw'iâkhem . . . that you should be an adversary (sâtân) to me this day. David's follow ing words, "for now I know (can recognize) myself as king over Israel," suggests the dangerousness of Abishai's counsel: to mar the day of victory with an execution, to shed the blood of an Israelite at a time when the internecine warfare has come to an end. It is not clear whether at this juncture David fears Heaven's wrath or has an eye to the possibility that an execution will embitter the recent rebels and lead to more conflict. Another instance of the force of mâ it wâlâkh is in the charge made against Elijah by his hostess in Zarephatha, as her son is about to breathe his last. "What have you against me, 0 man of God? You have come to bring my crime to remembrance and to cause the death of my son!" We thus have several additional examples of the oblique oblique style (cf. below) in these mâ li wâlâkh passages. For Abishai clearly was not devising traps for David nor was it David's intent to own Abishai as a conniving enemy. In the case of the woman of Zarephatha, her words reflect the popular psy chology of biblical times. A man of God is always a dangerous visitor (cf. 1 Sam. 16:4, the anxiety of Bethlehem's elders over the visit of Samuel) even when the occasion for his presence is not ostensibly a message of doom. Every mortal has "a skeleton in his closet," and closets have a way of opening up when a man of God is in the vicinity. 2 For the meaning of qallel, see my discussion in The Problem of 'Curse' in the Hebrew Bible, JBL Monograph Series (1963), pp. 138-141.</page><page sequence="5">[5] ON FAITH AND REVELATION IN THE BIBLE 39 communication which his enemy never claimed for himself. We have before us an instance of what we may call the oblique style of biblical idiom.3 Israel's monotheistic faith excludes chance or the operation of a minor deity as explanation for crucial events in its history. The hand of a purposeful God is to be discerned in every event, and since that God is ever moral, ever just, felicity is reward, misfortune punish ment. The pious man accepts God's judgment, hoping that the sentence is limited and the suffering temporary, or doing penance with a prayer for the mitigation of the sentence. This is the purport of David's response to Abishai. If God tolerates or grants tacit support to his own son ("sprung from my loins . . . seeks my life"), is he not a fortiori granting license to the Benjaminite Shimei? "Leave him alone and let him denounce" — for he is only reading the signs. This imputation to Shimei tjrat in a divinely governed world he deduces God's will from what God does, David expresses in the reiterated words "for YHWH has said to him: 'Denounce David.' " To take David's words literally is to rob them of meaning at best or, worse, to distort the meaning of Scripture.4 Another instance of this oblique style is to be found in the message of Sennacherib to Hezekiah in besieged Jerusalem, "Is it without YHWH's support that I have come up against this land to lay it נ I hesitate to offer a definition of oblique style lest it prove to be unnecessarily restrictive. In general, obliqueness of style, which may appear in the composition of a literary craftsman or in artless speech, is present when the words express one idea literally but are meant to convey a substantially different thought. Thus the mechanism or operation of obliqueness may be métonymie, hyperbolic, elliptic, periphrastic. Thus, for example, in the ma 11 wHakhem passages between David and Abishai (see above, note 1) the operation of obliqueness is métonymie, elliptical and hyperbolic. The actual expression is equal to, "What is the bone of contention between us?" — a metonym for hostility or enmity; the ellipsis is in the implicit but not explicit assumption that enmity is revealed in Abishai's proposal; the hyperbole lies in the construction of Abishai as an enemy when all that is intended is that the advice, being bad, might well come from an enemy; and metonymy is also (and again) present in the construing of the evil consequences of the advice as constituting Abishai's intent. 4 Maimonides saw clearly that the command of God to Shimei was not intended to be taken literally. God, he explains, is the First Cause of all things including (acts of) human free will. "The prophets often omit the immediate cause and ascribe the effect directly to God and use such phrases as, God has done it, commanded it, or said it; in all such cases the verbs 'to say,' 'to speak,' 'to command,' 'to call' and 'to send' are employed." (Cf. The Guide for the Perplexed, M. Friedlander transi., part II, ch. 48.) While it is not incumbent upon us to accept his view on prophecy in general or his interpretation of any given verse in particular, it is cavalier treat ment to dismiss him altogether as a "rationalizer" of miracles. To the mind of this reader, his discussion of scriptural verses in this particular chapter is far closer to p'shat than to d'rash.</page><page sequence="6">[6] 40 HERBERT C. BRICHTO waste? YHWH 'âmar 'ëlay, the Lord said to me: 'Go up against that land and lay it waste' " (II Kings 18:25; Isa• 36:10). Now surely the king of Assyria while in his capital considering a campaign against the rebellious vassal states of Philistia and Judah neither sought nor received an oracle from the God of Israel. The point of his argument, that his campaign against Judah had the support of YHWH, indeed — if we take his words literally — had been undertaken at YHWH's behest, was not lost on its hearers. They were reminded that in con eluding the treaty which first made it vassal to Assyria, Judah had taken an oath invoking its own God to punish it if ever it revolted.5 Now if Scripture can report that "God said" without intending its words to be taken at face value, it devolves upon us to seek out and examine other instances of obliqueness of style in biblical idiom. Let us consider Eli's warning to his sons of the danger attending their evil behavior: A man who offends against a fellowman may rely on heaven to moderate the judgment,6 so that the sentence is not out of proportion to the gravity of the offense; but what hope can there be for one who offends against the Supreme Magistrate himself? Yet says Scripture, "They (Eli's sons) would not hearken to their father's admonition, for YHWH wished to put them to death" (I Sam. 2:25). Or Scripture's asseveration that it was YHWH who hardened Pharaoh's resolve to disobey Him (Exod. 10:1, 20, 27; 11:10; 14:4, 17). The rabbis sought to resolve the dilemma of God's foreknowledge (equatable with his governance of the world) and man's free will with the dictum that everything is controlled by Heaven except the fear of Heaven. Yet in these instances in Scripture it would seem that even mortal will may be determined by God for the achievement of a preordained purpose. Are we to believe that the biblical authors were so unsophisticated as to be unaware of the problem? The answer, I suggest, is a categorical no, and the resolution must be seen to lie in Scripture's oblique style. The ancients expressed their bemusement at the spectacle of man (in our words) "hell-bent for destruction" in 5 For a more comprehensive discussion of the extent to which YHWH is seen to be involved in enforcing a treaty between Judah as vassal and a foreign monarch as suzerain, see my monograph, op. cit., pp. 36 ff. There can be little question that a treaty existed between Judah and Assyria, for Sargon lists Judah along with Philistia, Edom and Moab as a country which had been subject to paying tribute and which had revolted. Whether the treaty implicit in Sennacherib's challenge is one entered into by Ahaz with Tiglath-pileser is not clear, but there can be little doubt that vassal-treaties between monarchs were regarded as binding upon their legitimate successors. 6 Our rendering of the passage follows E. A. Speiser, "The Stem PLL in Hebrew," JBL, 82, 1963, p. 304.</page><page sequence="7">[7] ON FAITH AND REVELATION IN THE BIBLE 41 the apothegm, "whom the gods wish to destroy they first drive mad."7 Such is the intent of the biblical words, "YHWH desired, YHWH hardened."8 The world is governed by God — this must be plain to anyone who is sane or who is not willfully blind — but even willful blindness (as in the case of Eli's sons) or the madness of mortal pride (as of Pharaoh who persists in his madness despite ten prodigies) ultimately serves God's purposes.9 7 Quern Juppiter vult perdere dementat prius. 8 Another noteworthy instance of oblique style is the question put by the wise woman from Tekoa to David in regard to his keeping his son Absalom in banishment. "Why then have you devised such (an evil) against the people of God?" (II Sam. 14:13). The force of the question is addressed not to the king's intent but to the consequences of his policy. It is for us to fill in from the political situation the mean ing of the crime "against the people of God." With the eldest son and presumptive heir to the throne an exile at the court of his maternal grandfather, David is inviting a struggle for succession upon his death. The outbreak of a civil war in similar cir cumstances was narrowly averted in the struggle between Adonijah and Solomon. It is, incidentally, noteworthy that Joab, who is the author of the wise woman's suit for the return of Absalom, takes the part of Adonijah against Solomon, a younger son. ' There are a number of other instances in which acts, clearly in opposition to God's will, are formulated as deriving from the Deity Himself. Thus II Sam. 24:1, David's ordering of a census falls into the category of Quern Juppiter vult perdere. In I Kings 18:37, Elijah's petition that the people of Israel be brought to the knowl edge that YHWH is the one who "turned their hearts backwards" is an oblique way of saying that there is no power other than YHWH, as indicated by the pre ceding, "that this people may know that you, YHWH, are God." Of a piece with this idea is Ezek. 14:9 — if a prophet is seduced, and other than YHWH there is no deity, then YHWH must be the author of the prophet's ruin. Similarly Isa. 6:9 f. ; 29:9 ff.; 63:17, are sardonic expressions of Israel's obstinately self-destructive blind ness, for if the imperatives (in the first two passages) were literally intended, they never would have been uttered; they constitute a conditional prophecy, a warning, and not an absolute decree of doom . . . Note that these are all instances of oblique style. The problem of God's part in the behavior of Eli's sons and of Pharaoh is dis cussed by Matitiahu Tsevat in "The Death of the Sons of Eli," Journal of Bible and Religion,Religion, vol. 32 (1964), pp. 355-358. His solution to the perplexity raised by divine coercion seems to us somewhat off the mark: "These are the alternatives of the Bible. One is a rational explanation of human behavior. A chain of causality is traced back from an observed act of folly and sin, sometimes through mounting entanglement, to the first cause and origin, God. It satisfies man's search for a ra tional explanation of the world and himself. It relieves him of oppressive and bewildering irrationality." The difficulty in this answer is recognized by Tsevat himself who goes on immediately to say, "The gain is great, but the price is high. It is the disruption of the most essential thing the Bible has to say about man and history: that he is responsible because he can at any moment be responsive, and that history is the progression of moments of expected responsiveness" (p. 357). Tsevat's formulation of the problem, however, merits close attention. "The question is thrown</page><page sequence="8">42 HERBERT C. BRICHTO [8] At a little remove from Pharaoh's obduracy is the phenomenon of Israel's recalcitrance and faithlessness in the wilderness. Even if we exclude the quarrels over leadership perquisites on the parts of Aaron and Miriam, Korah, Dathan and Abiram and the two instances of disobedience in connection with the report of the scouts, if we further exclude the instances of rebelliousness in Numbers as largely doublets of tales from Exodus, we are still left with a remarkable number of occasions when Israel gives way to despair as if oblivious to the so many and so recent saving acts of God: at the Sea of Reeds, at Marah, at Massah and Meribah, at Elim and Taberah, under the shadow of Sinai itself. The power of YHWH and His concern for Israel, His elected people, have been abundantly revealed in marvel after marvel, marvels crowned by the very revelation of God's Presence, yet at every fresh crisis Israel doubts, doubts and despairs, and casts about for forbidden alternatives. What are we to understand from these narrations, narrations which would induce tedium were it not for the sense of the tragic? One wonders whether in our rationalistically motivated concern with the fact or the nature of miracles we do not tend to overlook the "fabulary" nature of these narratives. I resort to the term "fabulary"—from the Latin for fable — to label a genre of biblical narrative which is symbolic but not mythical, allegorical yet not fiction, rooted in history but not mere chronicle. The wilderness stories of successive failures of faith on Israel's part following hard upon wondrous revelations of God's power and concern We must either dismiss as childish and naive tales from a past still representing the childhood of man, or we must take them seriously, as transmitted by men both serious and mature. If the latter, we must confront the paradox: God's choice of a servant people was a blunder of the highest magnitude. Eor in the light of its unique experiences of the providential presence of God Israel's skepti cism and rebelliousness must stamp it as reprobate among the peoples and nations on earth, the least likely candidate for God's grace. Jeremiah expresses this in a trenchant hyperbole, "Has any nation ever changed gods — and theirs are not gods at all — yet My people has traded its glory for that which is utterly useless" (2:11).10 into even sharper relief when we observe that nowhere is the divinely-inspired hard ening of the heart a narrative necessity employed to solve hopeless complications or stagnations. In none of the scenes that are our concern does Yahweh appear as a deusdeus ex machina" (p. 356). Elsewhere on the same page, in reference to 1 Sam 26:18 f., Tsevat comes close to our own formulation: "A man who is master of his faculties does not act so senselessly." 10 The hyperbole lies in the use of the verb hàmïr. Properly speaking, the other</page><page sequence="9">[9] ON FAITH AND REVELATION IN THE 13IBLE 43 The paradox may be resolved by denying either that the wonders ever occurred or that Israel ever experienced them. Scripture, I submit, is pointing to the latter. This indeed is the very point of these stories: the nature of God's wondrous self-manifestations and the wayward nature of man in the question of faith. The heavens which declare the glory of God will make no impression on a blind man, nor on one who shuts his eyes against them. The fabula is given definitive ex pression in the story of Balaam and his ass — the wisest of men if he will not see is less capable of discernment than a poor, dumb beast. We must not stop, however, at discerning the fabulary nature of such narratives. Their purpose and function must be taken into account. The wilderness generation — like Balaam — is presented as a fact of history. And the rebellions are not myths. But Scripture is Israel's religious text-book. And the ultimate point of the narration is — as in the case of every fabula: De te fabula narratur.11 It is important at this juncture to emphasize that we do not see ourselves as engaged in a demythologization of Scripture. Scripture requires no demythologizing if we, discerning the various styles and genres of biblical idiom, penetrate to the core of Scripture's intent. To put it differently — and in full awareness of how open to challenge is any claim to have recaptured the original or basic intent of biblical expression — we dare to claim that we are engaged in exegesis, and not in rationalization. The danger of "rationalizing" an ancient text, that is, reinterpreting its intent so as to make its elements conform to hodiernal criteria for credibility, is that it evokes the suspicion of a nations, being polytheists, cannot "change" their gods, while Israel, which alone is committed to monolatry, is considered apostate not when it "changes" its God but when it worships other deities in addition to YHWH. Thus the consistent polytheism of the heathens, which is hardly a virtue or a matter of constancy in itself, is em ployed to set off the inconstancy of Israel. 11 The Book of Kings contains a number of fabulary narratives in which the "moral," while not spelled out, is easily discerned. Thus I Kings 13:11 ff. tells of "a"a man of God" deliberately lured to his doom by a lie. Obedience to a divine com mand must be punctilious, and a direct command from God cannot be countermanded by a purported divine message through an intermediary. I Kings 17:17 ff. (cf. note I, above), moral: a true prophet can be a restorer of life as well as a harbinger of death. I Kings 19:19 ff., moral: when one receives a call to prophetic service the response must be immediate, excluding even such amenities as taking leave of parents. I Kings 20:35 ff., where the moral is explicit, contains the secondary moral: a prophet is disobeyed at the hazard of one's life — even when he invites an assault upon his own sacred person. II Kings 1:9-15 sardonically juxtaposes the authority and power of the state and that of an agent of the divine. The horrendous tale in II Kings 23 ff. is a warning to all who would consider behaving contumeliously towards a prophet. Cf. Brichto, op. cit. (above, n. 2), pp. 174 f.</page><page sequence="10">[10] 44 HERBERT C. BRICHTO self-delusive apologetic. But a literalistic approach, apart from con stituting a prejudgment of the nature and intent of a sacred literature, often performs a fatal disservice to the cause of religion and faith.12 Just such a disservice is achieved by the dichotomy of biblical and postbiblical experience, by the assumption of a radical discontinuity in human experience, to wit: the Bible derives from the Age of Revela tion, the time when God spoke to man in unambiguous terms; subse quent generations are spiritual epigones who must nourish themselves on milk from a source they have never seen, transmitted to them in containers germicidally preserved through the generations. What is the common denominator of faith in God for the biblical protagonist vouchsafed a revelation and for me who has been denied that mar vellous boon? "Were God to speak to me as he did to Abraham — I too would find it no difficulty to have faith." How did God speak to Abraham? In Chapter 15 of Genesis we are told that the word of God came to the childless Abraham in a vision {mafrzë); drawing him out-of-doors and directing his gaze to the numberless stars of heaven, the Lord said, "So numerous will your issue be." Whereupon Scripture notes vehe'emïn b-YHWH vayyahsh' vêhâvêhâ lô s'dâqâ "And he believed/trusted in the Lord who accounted it to his merit." The question we must raise is, "Pray, what merit?" If it is meritorious in man to believe in God, to trust Him, the degree of merit should be in proportion to the difficulties, to the obstacles in the way of faith. But in this narrative Abraham has experienced a revelation, YHWH has appeared to him in a vision and promised him his heart's desire. And yet Scripture finds it necessary to make explicit what one should have thought to be obvious, that a divine revelation engendered faith in the first of the Patriarchs; and indeed deems it important to underscore this faith as being particularly meritorious! Let us attempt another formulation. Meritoriousness (or its oppo site, for that matter) can only be attributed to an act in the absence of compulsion. Faith in God is a meritorious act. Ergo, faith in God cannot be compelled. But Abraham had faith in God in the context of a divine revelation. Ergo, divine revelation does not compel faith. Does this not constitute a paradox — that one may experience God 12 12 At this point the suspicion may be aroused in the mind of the reader that the writer harbors a hidden agenda. While this suspicion may not be altogether without basis, I would emphasize that the propositions are descriptive, not normative. Even if one could not care less whether a given approach is salubrious for or detrimental to the cause of faith, it is worth noting that the custodians of faith are often the very ones who most stubbornly cling to an approach which raises, rather than removes, obstacles to faith.</page><page sequence="11">[11] ON FAITH AND REVELATION IN THE BIBLE 45 and yet be free to disbelieve in Him? Our answer is no, there is no paradox. Scripture is drawing our attention to the phenomena of revelation and faith and to the relation between them: Every revela tion is a human experience; whatever its manner or form, its degree or content, it is a discrete event; it takes place in time — it has a beginning and an end. And after the event man is free — to remember or to forget, to formulate in words the impact of the event or the message — if any, to accept it or — yes — to question its reality. Was it a dream, a figment, a chimera, an illusion, a delusion, a hallucination? The lesson Scripture would teach us would be far more accessible to us were it not for our habit of assigning our faith-experiences to one realm and those of yesterday's spiritual giants to another; to see the biblical protagonists as having received communication from and having experienced the presence of a God who has ceased to show himself and has left off speaking to man;13 to confess our own faith as derivative and vacillating, flawed by periods of guilty doubts and anxious skepticism, while picturing the faith of the ancients as ab solute and uninterrupted, whole and without blemish, rooted in a never-to-be-questioned experience of the divine. Perhaps the most astonishing (in sheer anthropomorphism) and the most opaque (in meaning) of biblical accounts of revelation con fronts us in the dialogue between Moses and God in Exod. 33:12-23. So mysterious indeed is this report that commentators, ancient and modern, generally treat it with uncommon reticence, as if reluctant to rush in where angels fear to tread. And such modesty is the better part of wisdom, for the more opaque a text the greater the danger of exegesis giving way to eisegesis. Yet the passage is there and is not to be ignored when one's enterprise is to search out as best he can how 13 The respective traditions of the rabbis and Church Fathers concerning the cessation of prophecy are discussed and related to one another by Ephraim E. Urbach in ?מתי פסקה הנבואה, Tarbiz 17 (1946), pp. 1-11. Urbach confronts the rabbinic traditions which date the cessation of prophecy to the time of Alexander the Great or even earlier with evidence from other rabbinic writings, Josephus, Apocrypha and N. T. that prophets and prophecy were still acknowledged in the New Testament period. His interpretation of these rabbinic traditions in the light of the polemic between the rabbis and the Church Fathers is most persuasive. His concluding comments, moreover, indicate that in rabbinic tradition the cessation of prophecy is not understood to be final and permanent, nor to preclude other media of revelation. His concluding sentence: "Prophecy ceased, evidences of the propin quity of the Divine Presence vanished, but Providence reserved for itself channels through which to disclose its will to its chosen ones and to illuminate for them the darkness of the future."</page><page sequence="12">[12] 46 HERBERT C. BRICHTO the authors of Scripture understood faith and revelation, which remain at best little less mysterious than the One who is at the center of both. Our question is whether this passage too is not fabulary in genre. Coming as it does after the Golden Calf episode, when the very existence of Israel hangs in the balance, is it possible that at the core of this narrative lies a crisis in the faith of Moses himself? Whereas the E account has Moses settling for an angel of YHWH's to march at the head of the Israelite host, this narrative, attributed to J, pictures Moses as insisting first that YHWH himself — no inter mediary — lead the host,14 then pleading, "Let me know your way that I may know you" -—surely a perplexing petition on the part of one who has been in privy conversation with YHWH for many days and nights on Sinai's peak; and finally — and how presumptuous — "O"O let me behold your Presence!" Moses wants to see God himself! What is the meaning of this bold demand? Is this a frankly an thropomorphic approach to the form and substance of God with Moses aching to satisfy an insatiable curiosity? Or is it an oblique way of saying that seeing is believing? At the least it is the expression of a yearning to learn the attributes of God, and in itself a confession that Moses who knew God as no man before him felt that he did not know enough. Let us turn now to the central event in Israel's religious experience, the theophany at Sinai, when God revealed himself and his will to an entire people. What did the people see and what did they hear? Only the most inflexible of fundamentalists will be disturbed today by the suggestion that the "miraculous" aspects of the theophany 1■י The words pânay yêlêkhu are not to be translated, "My presence shall go with thee," but rather (with The Torah, JPS, Phila. [1962]), "I [Myself] shall go in the lead," following Rashi, who gives the sense as, "I shall no longer send an angel, I myself will go," and cites the analogy in II Sam. 17:11 where ufânêkhâ hôl'khïm baqqerâvbaqqerâv can mean only, "and yourself lead the army into battle." Considerable perplexity is occasioned by the fact that God's promise to lead the host (v. 14) is immediately followed in v. 15 by Moses' petition, in the form of a challenge, for what he has just been promised; the second part of the promise, "and I shall give you rest," (wah"nï}15thî lâkh) also seems somewhat intrusive. A. B. Ehrlich proposes to amend the hanïbôthï to the hif'il of nâhâ (ad loc., Rand glossenglossen zur hebràischen Bibel I, Leipzig [1908], p. 405); and various suggestions have been made for the rearrangement of the text. The Buber-Rosenzweig translation provides a far simpler solution, i. e., to take v. 14 as a question: "If I Myself go in the lead, will I then satisfy you?" This rendering does no violence to the Hebrew and is virtually anticipated by Rashi, who explains v. 15 as, "It is just that that I desire — do not bring us up front here by the agency of an angel."</page><page sequence="13">[13] ON FAITH AND REVELATION IN THE BIBLE 47 are not to be taken literally. S. R. Driver in his discussion of the event is able to quote conservative English divines at the turn of the century on the symbolic nature of the events, e. g., the natural founda tion of the description being clearly a thunderstorm and the smoke and fire "just poetic accessories, emblematic of the central fact that the words proceeded from God."15 What requires stressing in our view, however, is — paradoxical as it may seem — the literalistic intent of Scripture here. That is to say, the description of the theophany is hardly so marvellous as to invite a rationalizing effort. Compared to Exod. 24:9-10, where the seventy elders of Israel are vouchsafed sight of the God of Israel, a pavement of sapphire under his feet, the circumstances attending the theophany appear mundane: earthquake, smoke, thunder and lightning, the blast of a trumpet. One can hardly fail to realize that it is not the circum stances themselves which are so marvellous, but that it is the presence of God behind the phenomena which makes them marvellous. It would have been marvellous indeed if the entire people had heard the words of the decalogue, or for that matter just the first intra ductory sentence. But Scripture not only does not make this claim, it explicitly excludes it. In the Exodus account divinely appointed bounds keep the people from ascending the mount, and the people insist that God's words be mediated by Moses "lest we die" (20:19).16 If a more explicit expression of this fact is desired, it is provided in Deut. 5:4-5. Moses says, "Face to face the Lord spoke to you on the mountain out of the fire." And lest we mistake the meaning of "face to face" (i. e., the affirmation of God's presence), his next words are: "I stood between the Lord and you at that time to convey the Lord's words words to you, for you were afraid of the fire and did not ascend the mountain." The words were heard — if "words" there were — by Moses alone. Which brings us to the decalogue itself, the content of the revela tion. How significant is it, or better, just what is its significance from Scripture's point of view? Scripture's — not ours. S. R. Driver's comment may be cited as typical of the present-day view. "By a few 's S. R. Driver, The Book of Exodus (Cambridge, 1953), pp. 176 f. 16 See Driver, op. cit., pp. 168 and 174, for the differences between the J and E accounts. Whether one engages in source analysis or not, it is clear that ch. 19 con eludes with Moses speaking to the people, but breaks off without telling us what he said to them; and v. 1 of ch. 20 introduces the decalogue without indicating to whom it was immediately addressed. If the source analysis is reliable and 20:1 follows 19:19, then we have the picture of the people restricted to the base of the mount while Moses alone engages in dialogue with God.</page><page sequence="14">48 HERBERT C. BRICHTO [14] salient and far-reaching precepts ... it covers the whole religious and moral life; and provides a summary of human duty . . . unsurpassable as a practical rule of life."17 I submit that it does nothing of the sort. The decalogue is a statement of Israel's minimal obligations — its commands are basically negative, prohibitions — even those formu lated as positive precepts. It was never meant to be more. And I would further suggest that in grossly overvaluing these commands we are blinded to the significance which Scripture itself attaches to them. If we except the cultic demands made upon Israel, viz., exclusive worship of YHWH, iconoclasm, Sabbath observance, and — possibly — the last commandment, are the norms in the decalogue original or unique with Israel? I submit that not only are they not, but that they were not so regarded by Scripture. The biblical authors knew without question that killing, stealing, adultery and the like were norms for conduct among all their civilized neighbors. The significance of the decalogue for Scripture lies not so much in the particulars of the norms but in their author. What makes a thing right (or wrong) is not that a society finds it prudent or imprudent, but that the God who created and rules the universe deems it so.18 This basic idea, implicit almost everywhere in Scripture, is ex plicitly expressed in a passage which constitutes a celebrated problem for exegesis. In Psalm 51, the psalmist after confessing his awareness of his guilt and sin, continues (verse 6), "Against you alone have I sinned and what is wrong in your sight have I done, in order that you may be justified in your word, be vindicated in your judgment." That the psalmist has sinned in order to justify God is arrant nonsense, and the notion that offences against God as opposed to those against fellowman are here intended is indefensible (cf. v. 16, "Deliver me 1ל Op. cit., p. 191. 18 A moment's reflection should suffice to bring any student of the Bible to the realization that Scripture everywhere presupposes that all men are responsible for their conduct, hence that moral norms are not only universal in their binding force but universally accessible — and this without special revelations. The antediluvians sinned, the aboriginal inhabitants of Canaan sinned, the king of Assyria sinned in exceeding his mandate against Israel — and all were punished. Jeremiah's call upon God to pour out His wrath upon the nations who have wasted Israel (Jer. 10:25 and cf. Ps. 79:6 f.) explicates the enormity of the offense as a refusal to acknowledge the will of God. True, God had warned the nations through Jeremiah (2:3), but was that the first time, or the controlling event? ... It is a matter of interest that in the rabbinic distinctions between the obligations incumbent upon Israel as a result of special revelations and the moral norms devolving upon all mankind (the Noachitic regulations), the rabbinic recognition of natural law is clear to all. But the attribu tion of this "sophisticated" concept to the authors of the Bible is still met by many with incredulity.</page><page sequence="15">[15] ON FAITH AND REVELATION IN THE BIBLE 49 from bloodguiltiness, O God"). The psalmist in declaring, "Against you alone have I sinned," is not so much (if at all) denying the commission of a wrong against a fellow man, as asserting that God alone is the source of moral values — "I have done what is wrong in your your sight" . . . the opinion of others is gratuitous and irrelevant. The I'ma'an, "in order that,"19 explains not the reason for the sin, but the intention of this confession: to affirm that God is the sole source of value and the sole judge of all conduct.*0 That God and not man — or society — is the source of all values is thus clearly one of Scripture's central and supreme affirmations. But this affirmation alone would have little meaning for man unless God communicated these values. Hence revelation, God making his Presence known, and the content of revelation — tôrâ.2I So stated, the proposition seems obvious and simple. But tôrâ is never simple, not for us and not for biblical Israel. That man proposes but God disposes is an honored, if time-worn, maxim; but its operation is restricted to man's ambitions and his power to realize them. In the matter of values the maxim must be reversed: the propositions may be God's but the dispositions are managed by men. How is tôrâ validated? Or, if tôrâ is self-validating, how may we distinguish be tween that which is tôrâ and that which is not? Deut. 18:15-22 and 13:2-6 are testimony that this problematic was as vexing to biblical Israel as it is in our contemporary experience. For whereas the former passage seeks validation in experience — does the word of the prophet come true or not? — the latter passage declares that even a sign or portent, publicly experienced, cannot validate a "prophetic" summons to apostasy.22 " To be sure, the conjunction I'ma'an does not everywhere indicate purpose. In Hos. 8:4, for example, it may signify result; and in Amos 2:7 a kind of equivalence, "thereby"thereby/to the effect of" — but neither of these senses is applicable here. 2020 "Against you alone," remains, to be sure, a poetic hyperbole. In a way it represents the reversal of a previously discussed phenomenon: the attribution to the First Cause of what is effected by an immediate cause; here the offense against an immediate victim is stressed as significant only in being an offense against the author of the moral norm. See my monograph (above, n. 2), pp. 143-170, for a dis cussion of the curious phenomenon that a biblical expression normally translated as "cursing God" really means to behave immorally vis-à-vis one's fellowman. 21 It should be clear by now that "torah" does not mean law. It is a broad term for "instruction," and whenever that instruction — be it a moral precept or cultic regulation, an instance of case law or a recipe for a spice-concoction — is traced directly or indirectly to the Deity, it has the force of "oracle." (Cf. in particular Isa. 2:3.) For this reason, and because it is less cumbersome than d"var YHWH or n''umn''um YHWH, I have adopted this term as the rubric for the content of a revelation. 22 I have reserved for this place comment on I Kings 22:5—28, the dramatic con</page><page sequence="16">[16] 50 HERBERT C. BRICHTO Yet this dilemma — of choosing between the utterances of opposed prophets — is only one small aspect of the problem. For even when we have instances of categorical tôrôth, prescriptions whose validity no one calls into question, we frequently find ourselves confronting an other problematic: Exactly what is the meaning of the various terms in the torah-proposition? To put it differently, all prescriptions are universals and are useful to the extent that they can be shown to subsume the particular cases of our experience. But what if the mean ing of the universal is itself in question? Let us take a few examples from the decalogue itself —10' tirsah, you shall not "kill."23 What kinds of killing are forbidden? Or to state the question somewhat differently: what categories does the verb subsume — warfare? capital punishment? avenging a murder? To frontation of prophets delivering contradictory oracles in the name of YHWH. The validation of the word of one of the prophets by experience proved of little comfort to the king of Israel who could not know which prophecy was the true one until he had sustained a fatal wound. The scene in the heavenly throne-room where the opus alienum (see above, note 9) is initiated is a fabulary figment of Micaiah's. Four hundred prophets assure the king of Israel that YHWH promises him a triumph. The lone prophet who gainsays them is hard pressed not only to justify his own position but to account for YHWH's betrayal of the four hundred. The lying spirit sent by YHWH (another instance of Quem Juppiter vult perdere as adumbrated in the king's initial reluctance to consult Micaiah and then by his refusal to accept a favorable oracle from him) is the answer — it makes no difference what the prophets say: the king is doomed. Zedekiah's response to Micaiah, the slap on the cheek and the question, "How did the spirit of the Lord make his way from me to speak to you?" is an oblique expression for, "You call me a liar — well you're another!" I cannot here exhaust all the instances of the fabulary or the oblique in Scripture. I permit myself two additional instances involving revelations. I. Elijah's experience at Horeb (1 Kings 19:8-133): Can this be but a fabulary? And is it possible that the parallels to Moses' revelation serve but to underline the contrast? For over against the thunder and lightning which signalized the Presence to the meek Moses, the frenetic Elijah must be taught that the Lord is not to be found in the wind, the earthquake or the fire, but in the gentle hush of a whisper which speaks more loudly than thunder. 2. I Sam. 8:4-7: 'n the account hostile to the institution of a monarchy, where the request for a mortal king is equated with the rejection of YHWH's YHWH's kingship (an oblique way of saying that they must be disciplined into unity by the force of a mortal, but cannot or will not follow the dictates planted within their hearts by God), we read, "And the Lord said unto Samuel, 'Obey the bidding of this people . . .י " Is this not an oblique equivalent for vox populi vox dei? But then, the Latin itself — unless we give it ontological status and ramify it into a theological position — is an oblique expression. « One cannot evade the problem by substituting "murder" for "kill." For one thing, what constitutes "murder?" For another, the verb rasa}!, is employed for the unintentional manslayer; cf.

And yet can we be sure that the extension or limitation of this term as understood by biblical man was what God intended in the bare formulation of the decalogue — and even, if so, whether this intent is fixed for all future generations? Or take the prohibition of adultery. Adultery is possible only when there has been a marriage. But what constitutes a marriage? (Or a divorce, for that matter?) Is a marriage effected by a priest, or a rabbi -— or will the town clerk do? or a solemn pledge by two lovers?24 We need not multiply examples. The citation of scriptural au thority on both sides of the slavery question, religious wars waged on both sides by sincere believers in God's word are melancholy proof of the ambiguities which men can find in the clearest of biblical revelations.25 And Scripture is not unaware of the problem. The classic expression of it appears in Exod. 18:13 ff. When asked by Jethro why he sits alone in judgment, Moses answers that the people come to him "to inquire of the Lord," betraying the notion that every particular case requires an oracle (either from the Deity himself, i. e., a specific revelation, or a response from one authorized to speak in his name — the prophet). Jethro's counsel is that Moses serve the people by being their contact with God (mûl hà'elôhïtn), conveying to the people at a1 Biblical Israel, to be sure, had its definitions of the constitution of a marriage or the effectuation of a divorce. But these are not spelled out in Scripture, and the labors of the rabbis (or of the framers of Canon Law) reveal the inadequacies —- or should we say, incompleteness — of a revealed precept. The problem, and the danger, lies in the easy confusion of the enactments of the polity with the will of God. Adultery as a category of morals and adultery as defined by local custom or legisla tion may be so different as to put a strain on the very term. This is not to say that all interpretations of Scripture are equally cogent or valid. The enslavement and dehumanization of the black man by the white has been justified by a twisted application of Gen. 9:25 ff. Ham was not the father of blacks alone and, further, of all Ham's descendants only Canaan was cursed. But all this is of minor significance as against the repeated emphasis in Genesis (and else where) that all men are descendants of a common ancestor, himself created in the divine image. Let us remember, moreover, that the early chapters in Genesis are not presented per se as the product of a specific revelation, certainly not to Israel alone. They are presented as historical data (allowing, of course, for the fabulary nature of much of the material), the common heritage of mankind; consequently, the proper relationship of the races of mankind to one another is accessible to all men through natural law (see above, note 18). Were we able to question the biblical authors concerning the oppression of blacks by whites, their response would in all likelihood be that the sin lies not in man's ignorance, for his moral knowledge has been planted deep within him by God, but rather in his willful and stubborn dis obedience — in his self-blinding refusal to recognize his brother in the black man.</page><page sequence="18">[18] 52 HERBERT C. BRICHTO large the general rules of conduct and providing for an appointed judiciary to administer these universals. This procedure, however, does not thenceforward eliminate the necessity for oracles: for, aside from the difficulties of applying general rules to particular cases, it is hardly possible to envisage all future problems and to legislate con cerning them. Thus we are informed by Scripture of three instances where Moses himself required special recourse to God for tôrôth, the need for which had not been anticipated at Sinai.26 As for future times when local judges will find themselves faced by cases in which neither general rules nor precedents are of avail, Deut. 17:8-13 establishes the Levitical priests at the central shrine as the authoritative oracles. Whether this passage represents an attempt to reinforce the authority of the regular priesthood over prophets is a dubious speculation. What stands forth clearly is that for all the authority of recorded revelations, these are not understood by Scripture as solving all future problems, nor as precluding new revelations through various channels. In summary, for all of Scripture's recalcitrance in yielding up the secrets inhering in the fact of revelation, the mediation of revelation, the content of revelation and the interpretation of that content, we have found nothing that supports the notion of a radical discontinuity in the faith-experience of the ancients and that of modern man, and much that militates against that notion. Language and modes of expression change, but the same or similar problems and assumptions are discernible then and today. No generation has a monopoly of naiveté or sophistication. Nor does Scripture claim for its protagonists a monopoly of either faith or the lack of it, revelation or its absence. Indeed, if our study points to any conclusion in regard to Scripture's view of the matter, it is that revelation follows faith and not faith revelation. Either God exists or He does not. Scripture says that He does. Either He speaks to man or He does not. Scripture says that He does — that is to say, He did communicate on specific occasions to men of faith with such wondrous results as to crown those occasions with the name revelation. But He speaks always and to all men through the gift of reason. His will is ever accessible to man if he will only un stop his ears and circumcise his heart. And as for the area of ultimate 6נ These are Lev. 24:10-23, fully discussed in my monograph (above, n. 2), pp. 143-147; Num. 15:32 fF., indicating that Moses was either unaware of P's formulation in Exod. 35:1-3, or, if he was aware, did not find that it subsumed the offense in question; Num. 27:1-11, where a challenge to tribal law in regard to in heritance is upheld by the Supreme Magistrate and made normative for future generations.</page><page sequence="19">{19] ON FAITH AND REVELATION IN THE BIBLE 53 values, where reason alone may or perhaps must fail, Scripture en visages no bar to new revelations.27 Let us tarry a moment over one last question. If it is indeed the biblical view that God is accessible to all men in all generations, in the voice of reason and in the mystery of revelation, why is the possible so distant from realization? Why does Isaiah defer to messianic time the moment when "all the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the blanketing waters of the sea?" (11:9). What defers "those days" which Jeremiah promises (31:33 ff.) when the potential will be realized, when the Lord "will make a new covenant. . . put His tôrâ in their inward parts, writing it upon their hearts ... so that no man shall instruct his fellow, 'Know the Lord,' for from the least to the greatest they shall all know Me?" An answer (perhaps the answer) is intimated in Deut. 18:15 f. Moses promises (and in v. 18 God ratifies the promise): "A prophet from your midst, from our own people, like myself, will the Lord raise up for you." He charges them, "Him shall you heed." But why in this context does he add, "This is exactly what you asked at Horeb on the day of the assembly: 'Let me hear no more the voice of the Lord my God, and this great fire — let me no longer gaze upon it — that I die not?' " A prophet, an intermediary, is needed, for the general — when their eyes are not closed and their ears are not stopped —- are afraid . . . And that fear is perhaps the last bar to the fulfilment of Moses' prayer, "Would that all the people of the Lord were prophets, that the Lord put His spirit upon them."28 דג The inauguration of the Space Age invites our indulgence in a speculation that could hardly have occurred to the ancients. Suppose man encounters on a remote planet a race as physically different from him as are the insects, yet endowed with intelligence and the power of moral discrimination. By virtue of what faculty would he determine whether the term "human" (as concerns moral obligations) be ex tended to include them or not? How might a prophet of ancient Israel formulate his answer? Would he cite YHWH as creator of the cosmos and father of "men" — begging the question by an a priori assumption? Or would he begin, kô 'âmar YHWH1 And would it make any difference? 18 Num. 11:29.</page></plain_text>
