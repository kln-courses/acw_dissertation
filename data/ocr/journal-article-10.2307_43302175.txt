<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tara- An Example of Buddhist-Hindu Syncretism by P.

The devi has sub- sequently developed in Tibet along Buddhist lines, becoming one of the most popular devotional deities. It can be advantageous in the study of these female powers to note the historical development of one particularly popular aspect of the goddess. Tārā, arising from an obscure position in the Hindu pantheon, became the most popular Buddhist goddess in India and Tibet, equivalent in rank to Kālī and Durgā in terms of numbers of adherents and distribution of cults. Among the Mahâyâna Buddhists, Jains, and Šākta Hindus, Tārā is seen as a manifestation of the primordial female energy of the universe. She is anthromorphized into the mother-goddess with manifold form and temperament. By looking at some of the representations, insights can be attained concerning the general pattern and importance of the female Energy in Indian belief systems and its impact on the continuation of the concept in Tibet. Tārā as a phenomenon exemplifies the syncretism of Hindu deities into the Mahâyâna. References to the devī in Vedic literature are very rare. Only the goddesses Usas and Ratrī are given much consideration. The widespread veneration of the female principle appeared much later, however. During the Epic Period, gods were frequently given šaktis. Brahmā acquired SarasvatI, goddess of speech and learning. Visņu had LaksmI, of great beauty and love. Siva at the time was nothing without the šakti in the form of Umā-Pārvatī and Mahā-Devi. It is from the latter that the forms of Tārā, specifically, arise. The Mahäyäna also had an early period of exclusive veneration of the male principle, especially during the first through the fourth centuries A.D. With the influences of yoga and later tantra , the šakti concept was fully incor- porated within the northern Buddhist pantheon.2 It was in this form that she was taken to Tibet. The concept of šakti is believed by some scholars to have originated from a combination of Aryan and local non-Aryan fertility cults. Mother-goddess forms are in general popular amongst cultures practicing intensive agriculture. These groups often have matrifocal social organization, which can contribute substantially to the status of the female deities. There is archaeological evidence to support pre-Aryan goddess worship in India (Harappa). The Vedic literature, however, contains several divine female elements which</page><page sequence="2">BUDDHIST-HINDU SYNCRETISM 47 might tempt the investigator to propose that the foundation of sakti cults arose exclusively from this period. Here is Adit!, the bearer of the sun. The, divine virgin, Prthvl, is the maternal earth. Uças is the preserver of men ushering the day at the disappearance of the fearful night. From the Rg Veda (VII.75.I-2)3, she is clad in white, with radiant beauty. She is a virgin, ag- gressive, merciless against demons. Kumar4 has found three types of Rg Veda mother-goddesses. There are the benign, gentle devis such as Ãditl. Usas exemplifies the martially spirited virgin. The third category includes the special tutelary goddesses, such as Sarasvatl. These 'goddesses' cannot be considered actual deities - rather they are anthropomorphic figures represent- ing various powers of nature. It would be illogical to conclude that the main Tārā forms originated from these Vedic image-types. Regardless where the concept derives, as Kinsley states, "her origins do not explain her subsequent history."5 A comparison between the Buddhist Tārā and the Hindu Durgā shows the strong influence of Epic Hinduism upon the former. Both deities are invoked to remove the "eight great dangers" ( mahãbhayas )6. Durgā and Tārā are consorts of Šiva and Avalokitešvara, respectively, who themselves bear certain similarity. Durgā as a protectoress removes her adhérants from states of captivity, drowning, and other calamities.7 In parallel, Tārā delivers man from the dangerous ocean, fetters, thievery, etc.8 The Mahâyâna has acquired 108 names for Tārā, each emphasizing one aspect of the goddess. Most are similar to the many forms of Durgā, showing attributes of benevolence or ferocity. Names such as Annapūrnā, Jagad- dhātrī, Kali, and Urgatārā are used.9 With the epithet As^amahâbhaya, both the Mahâyâna and Epic Hindu Tārā forms deliver one from the mahãbhayas . Both Tārā and Durgā are invoked for protection from veno- mous snake-bite. Forms of Tārā are enumerated in eight slokas written c. 8th century A.D.10 The Kãlikã Purãna has many forms of the Devī of Šiva. The Mahamaya form of the Hindu goddess is called Tārā or Chāmudņā. This particular devī becomes quite popular in Assam. A wrathful variety is described: Her complexion is like the color of the blue lotus. She has four arms and in her right hands, she holds the khatrānga and the chandrahãsa, and in her left hands she holds the charma and pāša. She wears a tiger- skin and puts a garland of skulls around the neck. She is of a slender, long, and terrible body, with long teeth, having a protruding tongue, extended ears, ride face, and red eyes sunk in their sockets. She is shown seated.11 The representations of Durgā and Hindu Tārā were similar around the 4-5th c. A.D. Archaeological records seem to indicate sculptural representa- tions of Tārā clearly established by the 6th c. A.D. These Tārās are in their original placid form - the fierce aspect of both the Hindu and Buddhist</page><page sequence="3">48 THE TIBET JOURNAL versions were to appear later under the influence of the Hindu and Buddhist tantras12. While it seems logical to acknowledge the Mahâyâna Tārā arising from an early Hindu counterpart, Durgā-Devī, some have argued that it has been the other way around. In fact, it is claimed that Tārā cults originated outside India in the land of Bhota (Tibet). This is impliçd in the Brahmayã- mala and Svatantratantra from Ladakh.13 However, these are late sources, and they do not account for the occurrence of Tārā forms in India prior to this time. In the Hindu tantras , Tārā often appears with Kali as representations of the ten maha-vidyã (objects of transcendental knowledge, the -void of time). These entities comprise the energy of the universe, of creation, of divine might. They also represent the powers of destruction. Inherent in the tantras is the notion that by facing these powers of destruction, death and time, one can be liberated. Kālī, in her Kālī Tantra,u is the Power of Time. She represents deep sleep, peacefulness, and is analogous to Siva as the Lord of Sleep. She is the mahã-rãtrl , the Night of Eternity. The horrible Kālī nestles the world at her breast in the abyss of the night. She is: ...most fearful, her laughter shows dreadful teeth. She stands upon a corpse. She has four arms. Her hands hold a sword and a head and shows the gestures of removing fear and granting boons. She is the auspicious divinity of sleep - the consort of Šiva.15 Furthermore, ...naked, clad only in Space, the Goddess is resplendent. Her tongue hangs out. She wears a garland of heads. Such is the form worthy of meditation of the Power of Time, Kāli, who dwells near the funeral pyres.16 In the Kall Tantra ,17 Tārā, the Star, is the second object of maha-vidya. She represents the Power of Hunger and the Night of Anger. Tara is referred to as the Hiranya-garbha , the Golden Embryo that manifests the omni- prescent hunger of samsara . She is a source of consuming light in the universal night. Tara, "that which leads to the other shore {tarati)" has a dual aspect. In her terrible forms, she is all-devouring. However, when food is found, she assumes a pacific nature. This nature of all beings is exemplified by Hindu Tara. The quest for knowledge is also a form of this hunger: In the might of Time, which is the state of universal dissolution, light appears as a star. This light is the nature, the source of all thought, and is the instrument of knowledge illuminating its object.18</page><page sequence="4">BUDDHIST-HINDU SYNCRETISM 49 It is the sva-dharma of wrathful Tārā to be the goddess of the destruction of the solar system ( sürya-pralaya ). Tārā as Hunger is manifest in the indivi- dual at dawn, after the night ruled by Kali. Tārā brings man from the fearful night of destruction to the new day, thus enacting "that which crosses over." The resemblence of Usas of the Vedas and this aspect of Tārā seems striking. To continue, She is the Great Void, the Star from which all ways gradually evolved and which leads all towards liberation from the endless (cycle of life).19 As long as food is provided to the burning star, she is benign. If nourishment is interrupted, she begins to devour the worlds (Urga-Tārā). The dhyãnas of Hindu Kālī and the wrathful Hindu Tārā are quite similar. In the Tàrã Tantra , Ugra-Tārā is: standing firmly, with her left foot forward resting on a corpse. She laughs loudly - transcendent. Her hands hold a sword, a blue lotus, a dagger, and a begging bowl. She raises her war cry, 44 HÜM ". Her matted tawny hair is bound with poisonous blue snakes. Thus, the terrifying Tārā destroys the unconsciousness of the Three Worlds and carries them on her head to the other shore.20 In another version: She shines upon a white lotus arisen from the water pervading the world. She holds in her hands a scissors, a sword, a skull, and a blue lotus. Her ornaments are snakes, which form a girdle, earrings, a garland, armlets, braclets, anklets. She has three red eyes, fearful tawny tresses, a wagging tongue, fearful teeth. Around the hips she wears the skin of panther. She wears a diadem made of bleached bones. One should meditate on Tārā, the mother of the Three Worlds, who is seated on the heart of a corpse, her face resplendent with the Power of Aksobhya.21 In the Mahāyāna, Tārā is enshrined in the Buddhist pantheon and is enrolled among the five dhyãni families of Vairocana, Amõghasiddhi, Ratņa- sambhava, Amitabha, and Aksobhya. In the iconography, all emanations from these forms of Adi-Buddha carry effigies of their respective dhyãna in their tiaras. For example, the Tibetan version of Sita-Tārā carries Amitābha in her diadem. The general iconography of the motherly Buddhist Tārās follows the pacific form of the Hindu Tārā. She exhibits the varada mudrã in her right hand. The blue lotus is retained in her left hand. Forms of this Tārā are widely distributed, statues of whom have been found even in Java (c. 770 A.D.)22 The spread of the cult seems to have occurred with the general northward</page><page sequence="5">50 THE TIBET JOURNAL movement of the Mahâyâna around the 7th-8th c. A.D. In countries north of India proper, the šakti became an entity to whom prayers could be addressed directly without priestly intervention. This must have been a strong factor in her rising popularity. In the Mahâyâna, Tārā is given a rank in the pantheon that no other female had achieved. She becomes a bodhisattva of the first degree. Consort of Avalokitešvara, she was born from one of his tears, sprung from his compassion for the world. The Mahâyâna and Vajrayâna traditions retain the dual aspect of Tārā.23 The forms of the bodhisattva may be classified into peaceful and fierce varieties. Common to the iconography of the former are the 13 body orna- ments of bodhisattva , including the five-leafed crown. The wrathful Tārās wear tantric ornaments of severed heads and skulls, animal skins, and usually hold weapons. As in Hinduism, the Buddhist tantras have enumerated several forms of the goddess. In Buddhism, there are five basic Tārās corresponding to the five dhyani families. Two Tārās are pacific, three are ferocious. Sita-Tārā is often shown seated, with legs locked, soles upward. She wears the orna- ments of a bodhisattva . Her right hand transmits the charity mudrã . The left hand is holding the stem of a full-blown lotus. This is the šakti of Amõgha- siddhi. An aspect of this Tārā is Jānguli-Tārā, the dispeller of poison from snake-bites. Her four arms carry the mudrã of protection and a lute. Šyāmatārā, the 'green' variety of the goddess is seen seated upon a lotus, right leg pendant. The right hand expresses the mudrã of charity while the left shows 'argument' whilst holding the blue lotus. The three wrathful Tārās described in the tantras are: Bhrkuti, the yellow goddess that frowns, is an emanation of Amitābha. Ekajatī, or Ugra-Tārā, is the most powerful Buddhist goddess. She has retained the essential image of Kālī. With prominent teeth, lolling tongue, this blue Tārā stands upon a corpse, laughing wildly and shaking her garlands of snakes and heads. She holds a sword, knife, blue lotus, skull-cup, and bow and arrow in her hands. Red Tārā, or Kurukullā, represents the Mahâyâna Goddess of Wealth. According to Getty,24 she is worshipped by unhappy lovers. Representing the power of subjugation, Kurukullā is invoked to bend to one's desires a recalcitrant man or woman. She presents a particularly interesting problem. She might have been a local Indian deity incorporated into the Buddhist pantheon. As beneficial Tārā can be called upon directly, Kurukullā may also cause subjugation and destruction through the efforts of the devotees. D.L. Snellgrove in his edition of the Hevajra Tantra , pro- vides a reference to this Tārā's "Four Gazes of Subjugation": Actual slaying should not be done as that would be indeed a breach of the convention. The rites of slaying and so on which have been spoken of, are for frightening beings in order to subjugate them, and by means of that to put them on the right path; on the other hand if</page><page sequence="6">BUDDHIST-HINDU SYNCRETISM 51 one actually killed them, that would be a breaking of the convention of the Great Symbol and one would fall into the Avici Hell.25 A yogi trained in the Four Trances of Kurukullā is said to be able to stop fruit from ripening, summon wild beasts, and so on. The proper object of this acquired power is to protect the Dharma , however, against slander, perversion of the teachings, etc. As in all tantric Tārā ritual, the practitioner of the Kurukullā tantra identifies with the deity's dhyanã image, thus be- coming the goddess and acquiring her powers. The various forms of Tārā that exist could have originally been individual regional deities in India. The general nature of the Mahäyäna was to in- corporate and accommodate local beliefs and customs. The Tārā goddesses were unique in that they could be invoked without priestly intervention. The combination of universality and accessability of the practice, without regard to caste or gender distinctions, must have been tremendously attractive. The records seem to indicate that the worshippers of Tārā were as widespread and numerous in India as they have been in Tibet. In conclusion, there seems to be a two-fold nature to Tārā that is main- tained throughout the centuries and across geographic boundaries. First, the general Tārā is perceived as the Mother - the gentle arbitrator between the profane world of man and the transcendent realms of the sacred. As Mother, through her compassion, can interfere and sway the harsh rule of fatherly authority, Tārā can aid man in overcoming the prejudices of caste and occupation in seeking liberation. Secondly, the Tārās have become special tutelary goddesses of specific areas and sects, possessing unique powers and attributes. By studying the iconographies of the Tārās, the relationship between her original Hindu forms and subsequent Mahäyäna and Vajrayäna elaborations can be seen. The importance of studying Tārā is that she represents, as no other, the dynamics of the syncretism between Hinduism and northern Buddhism. NOTES 1.
