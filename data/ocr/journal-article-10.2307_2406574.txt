<plain_text><page sequence="1">MASTEROMETRY AND EVOLUTION, AGAIN' M. CRUSAFONT-PAIRO University of Barcelona AND J. TRUYOLS SANTONJA University of Oviedo Our friend and colleague, G. G. Simpson, in a recent number of this journal (Simp- son, 1965) has done us the honor of com- menting on our work concerning some original biometric methods that we call masterometry. This was done especially to express an opinion on the implications of these methods for the mechanism of evolu- tion. In his analysis Simpson concludes that these masterometric methods do not argue in favor of any one of the current theories but that they do not in any way tend to contradict the synthetic theory of evolution or "Neo-Darwinism." We wish to set forth in the present note a number of considerations that we con- sider fundamental with respect to the critique cited above and to our position in this matter. Other authors, in addition to Lehman (1962-cited by Simpson, 1965), including Heuts (1960) and Blanc (1958), have expressed themselves as agreeing that our methodology provides evidence in favor of typogenesis and orthogenesis. Although we consider that the authoritative critique by Simpson, like all his work, merits serious consideration, we think that in this par- ticular case it fails to take into account questions inherent in this method and its results, which may be considered basic for our conclusions. Whatever criticism may be made of our methods, we believe that it should not leave out of account the follow- ing important facts. First of all, choice was made, before knowing our own results, of the type that could be considered basal for the whole group of fissiped carnivores, following Julian Huxley (1953) who stated: "The order Carnivora among the mammals is the result of the deployment of one original tiny flesh-eating creature into lions, tigers, bears, seals, pandas, mongooses, and many other specialized types." The original type is represented by Cynodictis, an average, basal, central carnivore without specializa- tion, of which it could be said (and has been said) that it represents the first break- through to the fissiped type from the miacids, considered as ideal transitional forms between creodonts and fissipeds. In the second place, significant charac- ters of carnivore dental anatomy were chosen and, furthermore, these were simple characters, in order that the methods should not present special difficulties in their ap- plication. At the same time characters were chosen such as to have a bipolar distribu- tion (or trends in two opposite directions) in the course of the evolution of the group. (Let us say in passing that Simpson claims that this bipolarity is not frequently found in evolution and takes as an example the case of the equids; however, in our opinion this bipolarity probably can be encountered in neoungulates, for example, in which op- posite trends do exist.) And, lastly, one of the most fundamental facts in the application of the methods followed was that, both in the values of a and /3 (the first method), and in those of P, C, and T (the second method), the regression line obtained for the sum total of the forms considered (treated as if they were a population), picked out at random, passed through the point representing the values for Cynodictis. And this fact, veri- fied more than twice (since the correlation between a and /3 was carried out three times with an increasing number of forms) I Translated from Spanish by G. G. Simpson.

June, 1966 204</page><page sequence="2">MASTEROMETRY AND EVOLUTION 205 seems clearly to establish that the chosen type was adequately representative of the basal form or type, or at least was very similar to what that basal type must have been in reality. On the other hand, Simpson, in making an analysis of the methods, does it sepa- rately for each, which does not seem to be proper if one bears in mind that in our own work we stated that, given the fact that the first of said methods (that of a and /3) was not yet sufficiently explicit, another had been sought which would complement and overcome the possible and indeed recognized insufficiencies of the first method. In fact one of the points that Simpson indicates as obscure in the first method, in which it appears as if the hyenas were ancestral to the felids, is well cleared up by the second method. Let us now say in passing that we have already well advanced another method which certain difficulties of time have pre- vented us from publishing. In this method we take into account the variate which we have called t, that is, the length of the talonid of M1 in proportion to C and T. This technique complements the earlier re- sults with new data and, up to a certain point, corrects some of the results still not sufficiently clarified by the two previous methods. And we must again insist that here once more the average of the observa- tions on this variate is equal to the value for the synthetotype. In our opinion there is something con- tradictory in Simpson's criticism. The in- consistency is as follows: If, as far as the results obtained are concerned, the method is considered good, in the sense that it ex- presses in a quantitative way observations on fissiped evolution that had already been made on a wholly qualitative basis, then the questions raised as to whether the ob- jective facts might have been obscured (for example by the confusion of regressions within species, within lineages, between species, between lineages) would not matter in any truly essential way. The agreement of our results with what was already known about the evolution of the group before the application of our methods, or without tak- ing these into consideration, indicates that these methods handle the factors involved in them in such a way as to overcome the inadequacies noted by Simpson and to summarize the other regressions and co- variances adequately. Furthermore, in many cases account was taken not of the variate or variates of a single individual but of several. The data thus represent an aver- age (although, in fact, in the individuals of a single species the value of the angles a and /3 is almost invariable and the differ- ences are insignificant on the scale of the graph used). It is nevertheless true-and here we agree with our critic-that these results must be correctly interpreted. But we also believe, as we shall point out below, that this inter- pretation will vary in accordance with the point of the view of the school of the authors who consider and analyze these results. This, indeed, is the sole reason for this reply to the criticism. Naturally, for our purposes, and because of the procedural nature of the methods used, we had to select characters that underwent evolution in two directions. (Nevertheless, in a forthcoming thesis by Father E. Aguirre it will be shown that the methods are also useful and applicable and give analogous results even when this bipolarity is not present.) But the graph of this double distribution does not show that it has occurred in a purely symmetrical way. Simpson says that, by the large, values of tan o12 and tan 8//2 are dis- tributed equally on both sides of the Y axis. This is precisely what does not occur. On the contrary, there is a greater number of forms (of the total number taken at random) situated on the left side (the hypocarnivorous region) and the distances from this axis turn out to be inversely related to the number of forms on each side of the axis. That is to say, the hypo- carnivores are closer and the hypercarni- vores are farther away. This is not sur- prising because, taking into account the whole biological history of the fissipeds, we know that there have existed more types</page><page sequence="3">206 M. CRUSAFONT-PAIRO AND J. TRUYOLS SANTONJA from meso- to hypocarnivorous than from meso- to hypercarnivorous. The adaptive "technique" of suppression of the metaconid has decreased the possible combinations between the two carnassials, upper and lower. We shall see another consequence of this disappearance of the metaconid in advanced hypercarnivorous forms. On the other hand, distances from the Y axis are determined by the value of a and are therefore significant. The difference be- tween 450 (the value in Cynodictis) and 1100, the maximum value found among hypercarnivores, is larger than the differ- ence between 450 and 40, the lowest value in hypocarnivores. There exists, then, a sort of compensation which explains the asymmetrical distribution. On one hand the impossibility of indefinitely decreasing the value of a goes along with a larger number of possible combinations between the two carnassials, taking into account the existence of a metaconid and of a talonid with great structural possibilities. On the other hand, it is possible to increase the value of a in a less limited way, but in exchange this automatically limits the com- binatorial possibilities thtough the disap- pearance of the metaconid and the progres- sive loss of importance of the talonid. There is, therefore, a compensatory asym- metry in the graph. It is to be strongly emphasized that it should be not considered mere chance that the average of the variates reverts to the synthetotypic value whether one is consid- ering the first method or the second, and whether this average is for all the forms involved or for a limited number of them, corresponding with diverse biocenoses by epochs. We now insist on the fact that reversion to the value which is considered primitive in Cynodictis occurred repeatedly among our different methods and through- out our investigations. First, it occurred with a group of forms that had been taken from the beginning as typical of the fissiped complex; again, with a larger number when we had available more specimens (and this both for a and for p8); and several times for each one of the biocenoses considered. This occurs seven times altogether for the value of or, three for that of /3, and three times more for each of the values of P, C, and T. That makes a total of 13 reversions to the value of the variates in the syntheto- type. We have further already noted that this also occurs in the case, still unpub- lished, of the value of t (talonid). Al- though Simpson states that the values of the mean for a in the different biocenoses is only very approximately that which we consider synthetotypic, we believe that this is not a serious objection, given the fact that the averages of the values tend toward the initial value. The absence of mathe- matical exactness was to be expected be- cause, in a fossil biocenosis, even though it is typical, some unknown (yet undiscov- ered) very rare forms can have been left out of consideration. Moreover, one should not forget the clear fact that the variation of a in the milk teeth of the hypocarnivores and in the hypercarnivores approximates that of the synthetotype, increasing relative to that of the adult carnassial in the former and decreasing in the latter. That there is indeed no significant cor- relation in the regression line between tan a/2 and tan B/32, in the region of tan 1/2 &gt; 700, is because our method does not take into account the development of the metaconid and its presence or absence, along with the occurrence of dedifferentia- tion of the talonid. It is just as the meta- conid disappears along with the talonid that the angle a becomes very large while the angle p changes very little, since /3 de- pends in large part on the trigonid and talonid of M1. It was precisely on that account, in order to compensate for the lack of correlation, that we chose the method of P, C, and T, in which the same logarithmic type of regression curve is maintained. That method indirectly vali- dates the first method, in spite of the fact that the first method has slight or no significance in the particular sector under consideration. In this note, we wish to emphasize a question to which Simpson makes no refer- ence and which must not be forgotten in</page><page sequence="4">MASTEROMETRY AND EVOLUTION 207 connection with the graphic expression of the ecology of the fissipeds by analytical methods. The most primitive types, with basic adaptations, occur in the graph at points situated on the regression line, or the "canonical line" in our terminology. In the course of time and on moving away from the strictly central region, these basic types with balanced adaptations, repre- sented by a more precise correlation of the values of a and /3, extend along the poly- tropic curve without leaving it. When we spoke of cladogenesis in application to the movement in the direction that we had called "extension" for the regression curve, we meant to refer to the idea that this line represents the progressive flowering of new normal adaptations, in which there is a precise play of correlation, as has been said, and which, therefore, does not bring about any improvement. That is to say, within the norms of adjustment of a with /3 there arose new types which were brought about by a cladogenetic vertical expansion without what might be called new inven- tions. "Dispersion"-and we agree that this word may involve some confusion, al- though here it is solely applied to the method under discussion-indicates that the types of fissipeds which were seeking adaptations that could be considered ab- normal tended toward the improvisation of new combinations in which the carniv- orous function was reached without the exact correlation determined by the regres- sion line from the equilibrium represented by the relationship 45?/22?30' in Cynodictis. On this account, these developments have been considered anagenetic, perhaps with some exaggeration, although we believe that the terminology may be proper after this explanation. The same may be said with reference to the ursids and the hyaenids, which may be said to improvise the coming into play of the variate P. With reference to the second method expounded by us, which has also been criticized by Simpson, we should indicate that the use of the variate P cannot in our opinion be considered trivial or super- fluous, especially if one notes that the relative value of P did not enter into the combinations tried out by the four basal fissiped families, because it there remained constant or nearly so. Furthermore in the ursids and the hyaenids, which are ana- genetic according to the ideas expressed above, P represents an improvement in the sense that the possibilities of combina- tion between C and T having been ex- hausted, the relative value of P here enters into the combinatorial interplay, to a lesser degree in the ursids and to a greater degree in the hyaenids. And the concept of anagenesis becomes justified now with the appearance of two fissiped systems that are really aberrant: the bears, because their omnivorousness is atypical among the fissipeds, and the hyenas because of their special trophic adaptation to sar- cophagy and more pronounced osteophagy. In the former the masticatory force is displaced toward the region C + T, and in the latter the region P acquires great power. The two families previously poorly dis- criminated in the regression between the variates a and /3, now, by the method using P, C, and T, form unified blocks and each of them is outside the zone of regression of the other families. But the most sig- nificant point is that the forms recognized as ancestral for each of these two families, to wit Cephalogale or a closely related form among the canids, and Progenetta among the viverrids, not only form parts of the groups derived from them but also are exactly on the line of extension and not in the zone of dispersion. One of the most serious objections made by Simpson to our methodology was that we should consider as a basal group the biocenosis of fissipeds in the phos- phorites of Quercy in France, a fissure fauna, considered till now as including types of quite different ages from middle Eocene into the Oligocene. Nevertheless, new paleontological discoveries of Quercy species in stratified deposits seem to dem- onstrate that this fauna may be less heterochronic than previously thought. Furthermore, Cynodictis or a related type</page><page sequence="5">208 M. CRUSAFONT-PAIRO AND J. TRUYOLS SANTONJA is an Eocene form. Again, the biocenosis of the phosphorites as a whole, even though it encompasses different heterochronic bio- cenoses, has exactly the same value for calculation of averages as if it were a question of mixed biocenoses in which, nevertheless, were found the types of fis- sipeds of each one of the ages included. Regarding stasigenesis in the graph, Simpson is right in saying that this does not appear as such beginning with the Plio- cene, as we stated. What we intended, how- ever, was to point out how, even after the improvisation represented by the two fam- ilies of ursids and hyaenids increasing the fissiped roles in the Miocene, there was clearly a change of direction which hints at stasigenesis in a relative if not absolute way, and even though it had not yet been produced as such. In summary, from all of the preceding considerations, from the clarifications as to how our methods were applied, and from details not included in the critical review by Simpson, or at least not in our opinion sufficiently emphasized, we may draw the following conclusions: If the genus Cynodictis or a related form is granted to be a basal average type, not specialized and totipotent (little dif- ferent from a conservative mesocarnivore, such as the genus Canis, even though the latter is somewhat specialized in the hypo- carnivorous direction); if it is granted that mere chance cannot account for reversion to the initial values in Cynodictis of the average of the variations taken as a whole and at random, and also by temporally defined biocenoses; if it is also admitted that there is a deployment from the point corresponding to this original form along the coordinates of the variates selected as significant of carnivorousness not only in two directions but also in a radiating way; if, moreover, as seems to be the case, the distribution of the forms with respect to the Y axis is not symmetrical; and if, finally, the ecological area progressively oc- cupied by successive adaptations broadens about the original point-then we believe that it is impossible to evade the fact that Cynodictis or a similar form represents a synthetotype. Also, starting from it and by combination among the initial values (furthermore representing simple relation- ships, Crusafont, 1962), but without losing the basic norm, which is seen by reversion of the mean of these values, the evolution of the fissipeds has gone forward-or one might better say, appears as if it had occurred- in a typogenetic and orthogenetic manner. It further appears that what has happened is like a segregation of characters originally concentrated in the synthetotype. In our opinion this assertation should not at all upset the Neo-Darwinians, among whom we count ourselves. Nevertheless it does force us to make an explanation. In the first place, the masterometric methods do not show us in any way the inner mecha- nism of the evolution of the fissipeds or of evolution in general. That is to say, it reveals nothing related to what the first of the present authors has called "crypto- evolution" (Crusafont, 1964b). These methods only make us see the aspect followed by the evolution of the group of carnivores to the extent that significant variates were involved whose distribution in time (and also in space, we dare say) takes two opposite and alternative direc- tions. That is to say, these methods relate to what we have called "phenoevolution" (Crusafont, 1964b). Nevertheless, and this seems quite clear to us, this aspect of evolution seems to indicate typogenetic tendencies since it results in the segrega- tion of characters in the way suggested by Blanc under the name of "cosmolysis." It also seems to indicate orthogenesis. Now, as it seems to us absurd to be dog- matic within the field of science and of knowledge, we believe that all theoretical approaches, including those that are not "rational" (with respect to ratiocination but not to complete reason), each make their own important contribution to the problems of evolution. Time, which has led to the discard of so many poorly founded concepts in the history of science, merely demonstrates the correctness of our point of view.</page><page sequence="6">MASTEROMETRY AND EVOLUTION 209 Furthermore, in a work by the first of the authors of this note (Crusafont, 1964a) and in a recent essay (Crusafont, 1965), an attempt is made to reconcile-and we believe that this is done more or less with success-the synthetic point of view on evolution with the existence of an ortho- genesis. This is not in each of the phyla but in what Teilhard called "background orthogenesis," which leads to man. From our point of view this is only the direction resulting statistically from all the trends that have existed in the course of evolution. It is furthermore the direction toward which have tended those vital systems which, in the incessant course of speciation, have not fallen into the trap of specializa- tion. In our theoretical exposition based on information theory and on the effects of the genetic code of heredity, following Schmalhausen (1960), mutation and nat- ural selection definitely enter into the process of evolution. But before our eyes appears the paradox that natural selection, precisely because it is selective, seems to us to control or channel the results of blind chance. Thus selection is reinforced by the biomechanical, biochemical, allo- metric demands of coadaptations and structural correlations which impose limita- tions. Thus orthogenesis is "constructed," that is to say, favored by natural and restrictive causes. Thus, therefore, there is no need as far as phenomenology is concerned to invoke any foreign factor to explain these directions which adaptation itself demands and which natural selection does no more than to force or to favor. In conclusion, let us say in the most cordial way which also is the scientific way, that we do not by any means seek to impose a personal a fortiori criterion. On the contrary, constructive criticism such as that of Simpson, and sincere reply to it, such as ours, has no other aim than to facilitate discussion. In addition, as a final note, let us say-and we say it be- cause we believe it is important-that in our total phenomenological analysis of the universe and of its laws we should not forget what seems to us to be certain: science reaches approximations and not fundamental truths. Perhaps this is be- cause there possibly exists another type of reason than that of rationality. This "other reason" may seem to elude science and to pass over into metaphysics, or, if you will, in our case, into metabiology. However, let us consider for a moment the fact that the system of space-time is an anthropomorphic and anthropocentric creation as well, and that in the last analy- sis we are imprisoned in it and make our- selves its slaves. Does there not also exist, as some authors say (De Rosnay, 1965), a "glimpse backward" in an opposite di- rection, and an achievement of meaningful values by other ways than those of reason, such as those of intuition, inspiration, and so forth, which can aid us in a prospective view of these meanings? In making our- selves slaves of this space-time framework, even though it is less rigid since the intro- duction of the Einsteinian concept, do we not act like a bird shut up in its cage and which thereby loses the greater part of its significance as a bird? We are still very far from being able to plumb these sup- posed mysteries which still surround us and which are the "other" reasons which we are still unable to grasp, but which we feel intuitively with all their ferment and which some day will almost certainly make us change our present views.
