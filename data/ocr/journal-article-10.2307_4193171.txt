Introduction The Book of Jubilees offers a picture of the world in which angels are very active in nature and in history. To a certain extent, the writer was simply following his biblical base in attributing significant roles to angels in the earliest times of sacred history, but he goes far beyond that base to elaborate a larger cast of characters and a more defined sense of their work. Among that cast of characters is a creature called the "angel of the presence" who mediates between the deity and humanity and carries out some remarkable functions as he does so. A Summary of Angelic Roles In the Book of Jubilees there are both good and evil angels, with each of the two types arranged according to their own hierarchies. In a recent analysis of Jubilees' angelology, D. Dimant' finds that the author operated with an original division of reality into three areas: the heavens, the earth, and the deep. Heaven is the place where God and his spirits dwell, the earth is the sphere of human life, and the deep (or the lower stretches of the earth) is the location where the demons and the angels who sinned are punished. The angels, never- theless, are active on the earth when God sends them on missions, while the demons also labor on a split level in that nine-tenths of them I 'IRICIP MD Mnf 11t n :D ECnn cr: D&amp;01 n ln-n :3" in nnt1 mnn (eds M.

Mankind alone is confined to a single level, the earth, which lies between the other two spheres of influence. The angels themselves are ordered in hierarchical fashion and have been since their creation. Three levels or ranks may be distinguished: the angels of the presence and the holy ones; the angels appointed over meteorological phenomena; and the angels appointed over the powers and other created entities (2:2). From the names of the first two groups-the angels of the presence and the holy angels-one learns how closely related they are to God and why they are rightly styled the "two great kinds" (2:18). Most of the author's references to angels are to these two elite classes. In several respects they are imag- ined in anthropomorphic terms: they speak with people, one of them teaches Abram to speak Hebrew (12:27), and they alone are created circumcised (15:27-28). In her summary, Dimant divides the actions of the angels of the presence, the supreme angel class, into two parts: their works in heaven and their works on earth. In heaven these exalted angels are credited with performing a number of functions: 1. They praise and bless God for his first works of creation (2:3) 2. They officiate as priests above, just as Levi's sons are priests in the earthly sanctuary (30:8; cf. 49:7). 3. They serve during the six days of creation, apparently in a liturgical sense, and also on missions for God; in addition, they celebrate Sabbath with God. 4. The angels are conversation partners with God, and at times he allows them to participate in his plans and purposes. In some cases they accompany him when he descends to earth (as at the tower of Babel and in the scene of Jacob's ladder). 5. In heaven the angels keep the basic laws. Tey were the first to receive the Sabbath command and they observe the seventh day with God. They also cel- ebrated the Festival of Weeks in heaven (6:18) until Noah's time. So, by obeying the commands regarding circumcision, Sabbath, and the Festival of Weeks, these angels keep the laws that signify the covenant between Israel and God. As for their activities on earth, Jubilees says of the angels of the pres- ence that 1. They see all that is done on the earth and report it to God (4:6). 2. They descend to the earth and make contact with people in three ways: teach- ing, carrying out certain activities, and by giving instructions or explanations. These angels have dealings with the demons because they are pic- tured as the ones responsible for imprisoning the sinful angels and the demons (10:11). They also counteract the power of the demons who</page><page sequence="3">380 JAMES C. VANDERKAM act on the earth by instructing Noah in the medicines that will heal people from the diseases that they cause (10:12-13). Dimant also notes that in Jubilees humanity before and after the flood enjoys different forms of contact with the upper sphere-the realm of God and his angels. Before the deluge God talked with Adam, his wife, and with Noah, but in the times of Abraham and Jacob he rarely appeared to them. Perhaps this feature of the text is a result of the author's adherence to the biblical text. Usually the con- nection between God and the patriarchs takes place through a vision or dream or through a direct revelation, not from God, but from an angel. "Although in principle one sees the removal of God from direct contact with humanity already in the Bible, in Jubilees the phenome- non is accented still more by emphasizing the function of the angels as mediators between God and humanity."2 In some cases Jubilees changes what are direct conversations with God in the Bible to conversations with an angel (e.g., the angel of the presence tells Abram J5 J2 [14:22]). God's removal from immediate contact with people required that the author fashion a more complicated and developed idea of mediation. The angels of the presence as a group spoke with people before the flood, but after the flood the speaking was done by a sin- gle angel of the presence. Abraham is a transitional figure in this regard. After his time, only in the story of the exodus does the group of angels of the presence return, and only at Sinai does God himself again speak. Thus these two events are further emphasized. The Plan of the Paper Against the backdrop of Dimant's helpful summary, we may tum to Jubilees' teaching about a fascinating character-the angel of the pres- ence whom the author presents as God's agent in mediating the mes- sage of Jubilees 2-50 to Moses. We first meet him at the end of chap. 1 where the Lord commands him to dictate to Moses the contents of the heavenly tablets, and from there to the end of the book he occu- pies an extraordinary position in the retelling of Genesis-Exodus. As he reads the history to Moses from the celestial sources, the angel occasionally breaks into the narrative to note what he alone or he and his colleagues had said or done at particular times. One learns that, among other accomplishments, he, with other angels of the presence, 2 't"rm 'l:f," 106 (my translation).</page><page sequence="4">THE ANGEL OF THE PRESENCE IN THE BOOK OF JUBILEES 381 saved Israel from the Egyptians (48:13-19), that he made the covenant with Israel at Sinai (50:2), and that he wrote the Pentateuch (30:12, 21; 50:2). As Dimant has observed, this angel of the presence first emerges as a distinctive personality and as a being with defined tasks in Jubilees' Abraham stories.3 In one form or another, this angel, whether alone or as a member of his group, appears in Jub. 1:27, 29; 2:1, 2, 18; 6:19, 22, 35, 38; 12:22-24, 25-27; 15:27, 33; 16:5; 18:9- 11; 30:12, 17, 21; 48:4, 13; 50:1-2, 6, 13. It is fair to say that the angel of the presence appears at the key junctures in the book: after the role of the angel in Jubilees 2-50 is set forth in chap. 1, he (at times with others) figures in the creation story with its teachings about the Sabbath, the flood story with its revelations about the Festival of Weeks and the calendar, the early revelation to Abram, the instruc- tions about circumcision, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah for sexual sins, the Aqedah, the episode at Shechem with the teaching against exogamy, the exodus and passover, and the Sabbath and jubilee legislation. The angel of the presence figures in the text when the author is highlighting a point. The present paper examines what Jubilees says about the character and roles of this revealing angel of the presence and attempts to iden- tify the sources on which the author drew in preparing his portrait of him. In an effort to clarify the angel's nature and significance, the bib- lical evidence exploited by the author is studied and comparative evi- dence is adduced from the Dead Sea Scrolls and other contemporary literature. It will be seen that the Bible itself provided the impetus for creating an angel of such exalted character and accomplishments. The composite sketch of the angel of the presence in Jubilees bears out a basic point made by S. Olyan: ... this tendency to fill in the gaps, to increase knowledge, to derive information from the biblical text, so well described by a number of scholars with respect to midrash, is precisely what was at work from the beginning in the gradual artic- ulation of the angelic host. The biblical text became the focus of intense exeget- ical scrutiny. Through careful study of the text, ancient and medieval exegetes discovered new information about angels: their names, the designations of their orders, their functions, their appearance, even their personalities.4 Or, as he adds later: I 'Vrm n," 107. Jub. 1:27, 29 would be exceptions to this statement, but they are, of course, out of sequence in the book. 4A Thousand Thousands Served Him: Exegesis and the Naming of Angels in Ancient Judaism (TSAJ 36; Tubingen: J.C.B. Mohr [Paul Siebeck], 1993) 10.</page><page sequence="5">382 JAMES C. VANDERKAM Exegesis is at least a major aspect, if not the most significant component, of the elusive framework sought by scholars in order better to understand the develop- ment of ideas about angels in late biblical and post-biblical texts. Exegesis has great potential as an alternative to the problematic thesis of the distant and inac- cessible God, with all its theological baggage. No doubt a number of different influences played a part in the articulation of the angelic host, as many have argued, but no general understanding of the growth of ideas about angels will be possible until sufficient attention has been paid to various inner-Jewish developments, especially the rise and triumph of exegesis in all its varied aspects.5 Jubilees serves as an instructive example of the major role played by exegesis in the creation of an angelic character, even if it may not be the only factor involved. II. The Angel of the Presence The angel who dictates the contents of Jubilees 2-50 to Moses is intro- duced as "the angel of the presence" in Jub. 1:27, and in the context of his first appearance in the text (1:29) the writer of Jubilees divulges something of the biblical base from which he worked (see below). In 1:27 he is told to "[d]ictate to Moses (starting) from the beginning of the creation until the time when my temple is built among them throughout the ages of eternity" and in 1:29 he is described as "the angel of the presence, who was going in front of the Israelite camp. "6 The Title "Angel of the Presence" The Ethiopic expression mal'aka gass7 means literally "the angel of the face." One of the Qumran copies of Jubilees, 4Q216, preserves part of the Hebrew form of the title in col. 5:5 = Jub. 2:2: 01MI'l. Hence the original Hebrew form of the title in Jubilees was, as one could have predicted, 01mfl 1 rn, and the meaning is clearly that such beings enter into the very presence of God himself. As scholars have often noted, the actual title does not figure in the Hebrew Bible but a s A Thousand Thousands Served Him, I-12. 6 Translations of Jubilees passages are from VanderKam, The Book of Jubilees (CSCO 510-1 1, Scriptores Aethiopici 87-88; Leuven: Peeters, 1989) vol. 2. For the verb "dictate" in 1:27, see VanderKam, "The Putative Author of the Book of Jubilees," JSS 26 (1981) 209-17. Epiphanius, De mensuris et ponderibus 22, in his version of Jub. 2:2, reads ayyeXot npo nrpoonox; the Syriac Chronicle reads ml'k' d'p'. The Latin version of Jubilees has angeli uultuus at 15:27. For these readings, see VanderKam, The Book of Jubilees, vol. 1.</page><page sequence="6">THE ANGEL OF THE PRESENCE IN THE BOOK OF JUBILEES 383 similar expression appears in Isa. 63:9: IN [qere: On] &amp;' n Dn 0707i n l'ID Not only are the two terms JRtn and InM paired here, but they serve as the subject of a verb meaning "save." The pas- sage is, however, rather difficult. The targum construed the verse to be saying that, when Israel sinned, God did not afflict them because "an angel sent from him saved them."8 That is, the angel remains the sub- ject of MVIOT1 and IDm is interpreted as iMr1!71 1i Mft (literally: was sent from before him). The Greek translator saw in the consonants -s the word mY (= messenger) and separated or read a Hebrew text that dissociated the words JR'n and 1120 and reinterpreted In' (apparently taken as singular): ovu npe'apu; o08E &amp;a5yyeXoq &amp;X'' aux'o; Xci_pto; EMaoOEV a&amp;xou;. Modern commentators often take the verse in this last sense, and it is one that relates well to the context.9 However, the three words in the sequence Csr1w vT DD IRtm are present in lQIsaa and thus are ancient; obviously they could have been quite suggestive to an ancient reader,'0 especially as they follow v. 8 in which God is identified as the savior ( O'rb D 'fll). This is the closest any pas- sage in the Hebrew Bible comes to mentioning an angel of the pres- ence," but the exact phrase is attested in several texts from Qumran. The singular form appears in IQSb 4:25 where the priest is compared with an angel of the presence: D'03 JR5D; the same title but with the definite article occurs in 3Q7 5 3, a small fragment with no context preserved: :'ln- 7RLC. There are also references to a group of angels who are called by this name, as both lQSb 4:26 and IQH' 14 [6]:13 I The translation is from B.D.

III: The Latter Prophets According to Targum Jonathan (second impression; Leiden: Brill, 1992) 125. 9 On the readings, see Olyan, A Thousand Thousands Served Him, 18 n. 18. E. Urbach (The Sages: Their Concepts and Beliefs [Cambridge and London: Harvard University Press, 1987] 136-37) thinks that the LXX reading "corresponds to the Tannaitic exposition 'not by means of an angel, nor by means of an emissary,' which is frequently found when there is a reference to God's vengeance on His people's foes and His salvation of Israel...." Whether the LXX expresses an interpretation or ren- dered a different Hebrew text is the issue. '0 For a survey of ancient readings and modern comments, see I. Fischer, Wo ist Jahwe?

She comments that the phrase ill "j1rmn "als Konstruktusverbindung die Entwicklung der Vorstellung eines Angesichtsengels gefordert hat" (10). 11 It is possible that Ezek. 1:6, which says that beasts of the chariot each had four faces (EYM) contributed to the title "angel of the presence."

Levi 3:5 (cf. 3:7; 18:5). 1 The Status of the Angels of the Presence Jub. 2:2 places creation of seven phenomena on the first day: heaven, earth, the waters, the spirits (= angels), the depths, darkness, light. That is, the angels are not only made on the first day but are the mid- dle entity fashioned on it. Of the many spirits listed, the angels of the presence appear first and were thus the first animate beings created. In 2:18 the writer identifies them as the first of the two great classes of angels; these two are apparently the only classes of angels to be 12 Translations of scrolls are from G.

A similar impression of their status emerges from T. Levi 3:7 where they are in the highest heaven serving, as their name suggests, in the divine presence. Other angels must rise from a lower heaven to bring items to them so that they can present them to God himself. In T. Judah 25:2 the fourth patriarch says that the Lord blessed Levi; hence he held the highest rank. Next came Judah who was blessed by an angel of the presence, while the other brothers were blessed by lower-ranking beings. The implication is that as Judah was lower in rank only to Levi, so the angel of the presence is subordinate only to God. In 1 Enoch 40 there is reference to the four "Faces" or "Presences," a title derived from Ezek. 1:6, and they are named as Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, and Phanuel in v. 9. In Jubilees, however, no angel of the presence is ever given a name; only the title is used. The author of Jubilees made one of these elite angels the revealer of his annotated history of early biblical times. The Exegetically Derived Roles of the Angel of the Presence While the phrase in Isa. 63:9 (nV 1ltrZ1; see above) and its con- text (the verb MD)ts71) may have influenced the writer, he seems to have developed the title and persona of the angel of the presence especially in connection with passages from Exodus that refer to an angel who accompanies the Israelites on their desert trek. Jub. 1:29 suggests as much when it introduces the angel of the presence in words that are quoted from Exod. 14:19. A transcription of the two texts reveals how they are virtually the same: Jub. 1:29: mal'aka gass za-yahawwer qedma ta'a-yenihomu la-'esra'e Exod. 14:19: mal'ak ha-'elohFm ha-holek lipne mahaneh yisra'el Only the variation between gass (= face) in Jubilees and aln'rtl in Exodus distinguishes the two. The writer further develops the role of this angel through Exod. 23:20-23 which presents a remarkable messenger of the Lord: I am going to send an angel'6 in front of you fjpmD R'm] to guard you on the way and to bring you to the place that I have prepared. Be attentive to him [vr=] and listen to his voice; do not rebel against him, for he will not pardon your transgression; for my name is in him.

The suffixal form is found in Exod. 23:23. Philo (Migr. 174) identifies this angel as the divine Logos; in Agr. 51 he calls him both Logos and Firstborn Son.</page><page sequence="9">386 JAMES C. VANDERKAM to your foes. When my angel goes in front of you [p'7] and brings you to the Amorites, . .. Several points regarding this passage should be highlighted. 1. This angel is the same as the one in Exod. 14:19 as the words "my angel goes in front of you" suggest.'8 2. In three instances a form of Omf3 appears in connection with this angel. Although the title DIMfl JKrn is not used, the words for mes- senger and face are in direct association with each other. 3. The angel not only leads Israel but is accorded extraordinary sta- tus. First, Moses is to be attentive to him and listen to his voice. For centuries this has reminded exegetes of the words about the prophet like Moses in Deut. 18:18-22, especially v. 19.'9 In addition, Moses is told not to rebel against him. There is a long-standing debate about the meaning of the verb YnnI (with dagesh in the mem in the MT). Is it from a root ir 3, or 7-10? The Masoretic pointing suggests that -1-nr is the root (= "make bitter" in the hif'il), while it is often pro- posed that it be repointed to -onl, deriving it from, ;rn (= "show dis- obedience, rebelliousness" in the hifcil).20 4. The words "But if you listen attentively to his voice and do all that I say" provide an interesting parallel between "his voice" and "all that I say"; this, coupled with "for my name is in him," expresses, as B. Childs notes about the passage, "the virtual identification of the angel with God himself."2' J. Fossum writes: "This means that he has put his power into the angel and thus will be with his people through the agency of the angel. The Angel of the Lord is an extension of YHWH's personality, because the proper Name of God signifies the divine nature. Thus, the Angel of the Lord has full divine authority by 17 The sequel in Exodus speaks of not worshiping but destroying the gods of the nations in Canaan and of making no covenant with them, sentiments of considerable interest to the author of Jubilees. On this, see E. Schwarz, Identitat durch Abgrenzung (Europaische Hochschulschriften XXIII, 162; Frankfurt am Main and Bern: Peter Lang, 1982) 37-62. '" For other references see Exod. 32:34; 33:2; Num. 20:16. Mal. 3:1 is also of inter- est. There the term, 'DR&amp;7 is employed in the immediate context of the verb 1:MI. ' See B. Childs, The Book of Exodus: A Critical, Theological Commentary (OTL; Louisville: The Westminster Press, 1974) 487. 20 BDB does not recognize a root m:: with an appropriate meaning for this context. Rashbam took the verb in Exod. 23:21 to mean "do not replace him," comparing Lev. 27:33. For a discussion of his views and other options considered by rabbinic and medieval scholars, see M. Lockshin, Rashbam's Commentary on Exodus: An Annotated Translation (BJS 310; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1997) 289-90. 21 B.

The LXX reads at *p -'n - V (Samaritan Pentateuch: 'vp), and where MT has 111p:) 'nt it reads 'nO yap ovog.d Roi En' aor&amp;r).23 Its version thus tones down some of the stronger expressions that survive in the MT. Exod. 23:20-23, which appears within the Sinai pericope and a short distance before the section in Exodus 24 on which Jubilees 1 is in part based, establishes the closeness of the angel to God and could have suggested combining JR5n and D'J)it to the writer of Jubilees. The passage also presents him as one who should be heeded since he speaks in God's name. In fact what he says is equivalent to what the Lord declares because the Lord's name is in him. Here mention should also be made of Exod. 33:12-16a. As Moses and the Lord discuss the future of the people after the incident of the golden calf, Moses objects: "See, you have said to me, 'Bring up this people'; but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, 'I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight.' Now, if I have found favor in your sight, show me your ways, so that I may know you and find favor in your sight. Consider too that this nation is your people." He said, "My presence [P] will go [1:i'] with you, and I will give you rest." And he said to him, "If your presence [18:X] will not go [a'5;1 do not carry us up from here. For how shall it be known that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people, unless you go with us?" This passage (cf. also 33:20), like 23:20-23, highlights how the pres- ence and the Lord himself are nearly identical;24 use of forms of Jltn 22 J. Fossum, The Name of God and the Angel of the Lord: Samaritan and Jewish Concepts of Intermediation and the Origin of Gnosticism (WUNT 36; Tubingen: Mohr [Siebeck], 1985) 86. The passage also served as a source for other developments. So, for example, 3 Enoch 12:5 relates the title lapi I1FP for Enoch to Exod. 23:20; in 12:1 (and elsewhere) Metatron is called the Prince of the Divine Presence (cf. P. Alexander, "3 [Hebrew Apocalypse of] Enoch," OTP 1.242-43). See also Olyan, A Thousand Thousands Served Him, 17 n. 16, 92-93. 23 See M. Mach, Entwicklungsstadien des jiidischen Engelglaubens in vorrabbini- scher Zeit (TSAJ 34; Tiubingen: J.C.B. Mohr [Paul Siebeck], 1992) 89. The LXX also has a significant addition after "all that I say [LXX: command]": and keep my covenant, you will be to me a special people from all the nations; for all the earth is mine, but you will be to me a royal priesthood and a holy nation. You will say these things to the sons of Israel: if you truly listen to my voice and do all these things that I say to you (my literal translation). At this point it returns to the text as found in the MT. Most of the longer section comes from Exod. 19:5-6. There are no Qumran frag- ments for Exod. 23:20-23. 24 For Rashi and Rashbam on the passage, see Lockshin, Rashbam's Commentary</page><page sequence="11">388 JAMES C. VANDERKAM with the presence reminds one of the way in which the angel is described in Exod. 14:19; 23:23. Exod. 32:34 is another passage in which the Lord tells Moses that an angel will go in front of the people in the wilderness, and there too the term "face" is used in the immediate context (1n',1 Jb 'ZtrZ nrn). Num. 20:16 is also of interest in this regard. There (vv. 14-17) in his message to the king of Edom Moses recounts the nation's recent history and includes the statement: "and when we cried to the Lord, he heard our voice, and sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt." This passage, assigned by the documentarians to the E source (as are Exod. 14:19a; 23:20-23; 32:34), attributes the exodus from Egypt to the intermediate action of an angel (not further defined other than that God sent him) and even uses the verb INS'l with the angel as its sub- ject. When Num. 20:16 is contrasted with its near parallel in Deut. 26:8, the difference is instructive: there it is the Lord himself who is the subject of the very same verb. As M. Weinfeld comments: ... the deuteronomic ideology can be seen in the omission of the role of the angel in the redemption of the people (a tradition which is known to us from the Elohistic source, Exod. 14:19a; 23:20; 32:34, on which D relies upon [sic] in other respects). This same tendency can also be found in Deut. 7 which.., takes up most of the motifs of Exod. 23:20-23 but omits that of the angel."'25 Deut. 4:37 offers an intriguing reformulation of the idea: Dn-r3nS i1JFT nnir 11)" Inin. Here II=Bf almost sounds as if an angel of the presence were the one who led the people out of Egypt. Another set of passages seems to have influenced the Jubilean pic- ture of the angel of the presence who reveals the book to Moses. In Genesis and Exodus there are several references to 'nlne/mnrr JROz, an intriguing character whose relation to the deity seems fluid. At times he appears to be the Lord himself and at times the two are dis- tinguished. In the scriptural portions that are relevant for Jubilees, the title occurs in Gen. 16:7, 9, 10, 11; 21:17 (oil- 19rz); 22:11, 15; 31:11 (TI?Rt 7&amp;Kr); Exod. 3:2; 14:19 (0'71*rl JtK'). The Genesis 16 account about Hagar is not reproduced in Jubilees, whereas the story on Exodus, 406-10. Rashbam says about "my presence will go" in v. 14: "I, Myself, will go." 25 Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomic School (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1972; reprinted Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 1992) 34. On the relation between God and the angel, especially in the Exodus passages, see Mach, Entwicklungsstadien des judischen Engelsglaubens, 43-45.</page><page sequence="12">THE ANGEL OF THE PRESENCE IN THE BOOK OF JUBILEES 389 about her and her child in Genesis 21 is treated in Jub. 17:8-14. There the angel who appears to Hagar is called an "angel of God-one of the holy ones" (v. 11). Hence in this case the title in the Hebrew text did not suggest to the author that the angel of the presence was involved, merely one of the second highest class of angels. The references to mimn' 7nn in Gen. 22:11, 15 are more instructive. Jubilees treats this part of the story about the Aqedah in 18:9-11, one of the texts where the angel of the presence refers to himself in the first person. In v. 10 the writer has him say: "So I called to him from heaven and said to him: 'Abraham, Abraham!"' This is a verbatim quotation of Gen. 22:11, with mn-ir jn~m replaced by the "I" of Jubilees's angel of the presence. In the second instance (Gen. 22:15 = Jub. 18:14) most of the Ethiopic manuscripts read, "The Lord again called to Abraham by his name from heaven, just as we had appeared in order to speak to him in the Lord's name." This is odd because to this point the Lord had not called Abraham by name in the story-the angel of the presence was the one who had called him by name in v. 10-hence this could hardly be the second time. The Latin manu- script lacks "The Lord" at the beginning of the verse, but it does, like the Ethiopic, use a third-person singular form of the verb (uocauit). A number of the Ethiopic manuscripts also omit "The Lord" at this point but place it after "name" so that the passage reads: "He called Abraham in the name of the Lord." This reading presupposes that the angel is still the speaker but it does not make the text consistent by reading a first person singular verb. The correct reading here is also related to the latter part of the verse where the angel is speaking: "The Lord again called to Abraham by his name from heaven, just as we had appeared in order to speak to him in the Lord's name." The meaning of the last clause may be that the angel is comparing the Lord's call to Abraham to the one by the angel (although it is plural here) who was in fact speaking in God's name. The Latin has: "He again called to Abraham by his name from heaven, since we were to speak to him in the Lord's name." It is possible that the original text had the angel speaking here as well, but no definitive conclusion can be drawn because no Qumran fragment of Jubilees overlaps with this passage. It may be that the Lord's speaking in the next verse (swear- ing by himself) led scribes to insert "The Lord" as the subject here, changing an original tpor to mm' ip'i. The next "angel of the Lord/God" passage, Gen. 31:11, is not reproduced in Jubilees, but Exod. 3:2, where the MT reports that the angel of the Lord appeared to Moses at Mt Horeb, does figure in the</page><page sequence="13">390 JAMES C. VANDERKAM book though in a cursory way. In general, Jubilees swiftly surveys much of the Moses story, and it has only a vague reference to the entire scene of Exodus 3: "You know who spoke to you at Mt Sinai" (48:2). In 48:4 the revealing angel does say to Moses "I rescued you" with reference to the incident of Exod. 4:24-26, but he is not so direct in connection with the revelation at Mt Horeb = Mt Sinai. The last "angel of the Lord/God" passage listed above, Exod. 14:19, is, as we have seen, the passage from which the writer takes his description of the angel of the presence in Jub. 1:29. The result of this survey is that the author of Jubilees clearly identifies the angel of the Lord as the angel of the presence in one case (Gen. 22:11 = Jub. 18:10). There are two other instances where he could have done the same, but in Jub. 18:14 = Gen. 22:15 there is a textual problem, and in Jub. 48:2 (cf. Exod. 3:2) the abbreviated narrative is vague. The author has taken his description of the angel of the presence in Jub. 1:29 fnom the one given for the angel of God in Exod. 14:19, a passage related to Exod. 23:20-23 and 33:12-16. Replacing the Deity To complete the picture of the angel of the presence in the Book of Jubilees, it is necessary to include another series of passages in which the angel claims for himself what in the Bible are words or deeds of God. 1. Jub. 6:19 (speaking about the Festival of Weeks): "Abraham alone kept (it), and his sons Isaac and Jacob kept it until your [Mo- ses's] lifetime. During your lifetime the Israelites had forgotten (it) until I26 renewed (it) for them at this mountain." It is the claim of Jubilees that the angel of the presence was the one who made the covenant with the Israelites at Mt Sinai. There are, of course, other texts that speak of angelic involvement in the covenant-making and law-giving at Sinai, but Jubilees makes a stronger claim: the angel himself renewed the covenant. Exod. 24:8 (see also 34:10, 27; Deut. 4:23; 5:2; 9:9) refers to the agreement as the covenant that the Lord has made with you," and Jub. 1:5 quotes the Lord as dealing with "the covenant between me and you which I am making today on Mt Sinai for their offspring." The angel's point may simply be that he mediated the covenant, spoke in the Lord's name (as someone seems to do in much of the 26 R.H. Charles, following the reading of one manuscript (and a poor one at that), translated as "ye celebrated it anew" (The Book of Jubilees, 52).</page><page sequence="14">THE ANGEL OF THE PRESENCE IN THE BOOK OF JUBILEES 391 decalogue where the deity is mentioned in the third person), not that he actually made the covenant. 2. Jub. 6:22 (cf. 30:12): "For I have written (this) in the book of the first law in which I wrote for you that you should celebrate it [the Festival of Weeks] at each of its times one day in a year. I have told you about its sacrifice so that the Israelites may continue to remem- ber and celebrate it throughout their generations during this month- one day each year." Here the claim is that the angel of the presence wrote the first law, that is, the Pentateuch, including the section about the Festival of Weeks in the cultic calendars (Lev. 23:15-21 and Num. 28:26-31, where the sacrifices are specified). These passages are rep- resented as direct revelations by God to Moses in Leviticus and Num- bers, not as statements from an angel. Jubilees seems to presuppose the same situation at Sinai as Stephen enunciates in Acts 7:38: "He [Moses] is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at Mt. Sinai and to our ancestors; and he received living oracles to give us."27 3. Jub. 12:22: In this Abram pericope one reads: "When he had finished speaking and praying, then the word of the Lord was sent to him through me: 'Now you, come from your land, your family, and your father's house to the land which I will show you."' In Gen. 12:1 these words are spoken by the Lord to Abram: "Now the Lord said to Abram, 'Go from your country...'." 4. Jub. 30:12: As he retells and modifies Genesis 34, the angel of the presence says to Moses: "For this reason I have written for you in the words of the law everything that the Shechemites did to Dinah and how Jacob's sons said: 'We will not give our daughter to a man who has a foreskin because for us that would be a disgraceful thing."' In this case there is a near quotation from Gen. 34:14 and the angel claims to have written it. In doing so he is consistent with his autho- rial claim in Jub. 6:22. 5. Jub. 48:4: The context is the plague section of Exodus: "I res- cued you from his power. You performed the signs and miracles which you were sent to perform in Egypt against the pharaoh, all his 27 The reference to one angel parallels Jubilees; elsewhere in the New Testament more than one angel is mentioned as mediating the law at Sinai (Acts 7:53, Gal. 3:19; Heb. 2:2). For other references, see J. Fitzmyer, The Acts of the Apostles (AB 31; New York: Doubleday, 1998) 380, 385-86; J. Kugel, Traditions of the Bible: A Guide to the Bible As It Was at the Start of the Common Era (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1998) 670-71.</page><page sequence="15">392 JAMES C. VANDERKAM house, his servants, and his nation." This verse is an unusual case. The reference here is to Exod. 4:24-26 where the Lord is the one who tries to kill Moses and his wife Zipporah is the one who saves him. In Jubilees the attack on Moses is attributed to the prince of Mastema (cf. Jub. 17:16), and the angel reports that he saved Moses from him (cf. Isa. 63:9). 6. Jub. 48:13: In connection with the exodus and the crossing of the sea, the angel says: "I stood between you, the Egyptians, and the Israelites. We rescued28 the Israelites from his power and from the power of the people. The Lord brought them out through the middle of the sea as if on dry ground." Exod. 13:21 says: "The Lord went in front of them19 in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night, to give them light so that they might travel by day and by night." But Jubilees reflects the fact that in Exod. 14:19a it is the angel of God who "moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved in front of them and took its place behind them." However, to say that the angels of the presence rescued or saved the Israelites at the sea seems contrary to Exod. 14:30: "Thus the Lord saved Israel on that day from the Egyptians.... III. Conclusions The result is that the author of Jubilees, through exegesis and apparently through other means, has crafted the image of a remark- able angel who speaks in God's name and even does some of the deeds attributed to God in Genesis and Exodus. What did the writer accomplish through his expository and redactional feats and why did he engage in them? Of course we do not know for sure because he did not tell us, but the book yields some clues. 1. A theological inference from what the author of Jubilees does is that in his narrative God is exalted or distanced by being removed from almost all immediate contact with the world. God's direct actions in history are made less frequent and thus those interventions are highlighted (e.g., speaking directly with Moses in 1:5-26; doing the same with the angel of the presence in 1:27-28; and ruling Israel in 28 Recall that Isa. 63:9 uses the verb "save" with the angel of God's face as the subject. 19 Note the similarity to what is claimed for the angel in Exod. 14:19. The theme of the Lord going before the people in a pillar is attributed to the J source (see also Exod. 14:19b; Num. 14:14).</page><page sequence="16">THE ANGEL OF THE PRESENCE IN THE BOOK OF JUBILEES 393 15:30-32). Naturally, this does not mean he is disinterested or unin- volved; he is interested and deeply involved but prefers to act and communicate through mediate beings. 2. Exegetically, the writer has also solved some problems. The books of Genesis and Exodus could leave the reader puzzled about a basic question: Who is speaking in these books? That is, who is the narrator? It seems not to be God because he is often described in the third person. Even in the revelation at Sinai there are oddities. For example, if God revealed the ten commandments, why is the second commandment worded such that the deity is referred to in the third person ("the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain")? Also, why do some of the Exodus passages surveyed above say that an angel led the people out of Egypt when others clearly made the deity the cause and leader of the exodus? The writer has exploited what is said about a special angel in several places in the Bible and drawn the consequences from them. 3. For the sake of his own book, the writer has established its great and unquestioned authority by tying it directly to the extraordinary angel of the presence. He is the one who dictates all the words of Jubilees 2-50 to Moses. Yet, not only is the angel of the presence the authority behind these words; the writer further bolsters the authority of his book by picturing this angel as reading to Moses from the inscribed tablets of heaven30 and he does all of this by divine com- mand. What could be more authoritative than a book written by Moses, dictated to him by an angel of the very face of God, based on the unimpeachable contents of the heavenly tablets, and mandated by God himself?73' 30 On this important theme, see F. Garcia Martinez, "The Heavenly Tablets in the Book of Jubilees," Studies in the Book of Jubilees (eds M. Albani, J. Frey and A. Lange; TSAJ 65; Tubingen: J.C.B. Mohr [Paul Siebeck], 1997) 243-60. 31 See H. Najman, "Interpretation as Primordial Writing: Jubilees and Its Authority Conferring Strategies," JSJ 30 (1999) 379-410.</page></plain_text>
