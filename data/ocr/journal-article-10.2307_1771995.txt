<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Macro-Structure of the Conventional Narrative * JEAN-MICHEL ADAM Linguistics, Haute Normandie Once the "macro-structure" of the text has been recognized, it is easier to tackle the analysis of "micro-structures," using the tools elaborated within the frame of actantial syntax (being- statements, doing-statements, narrative propositions, etc.). -A.J. Greimas (Preface to J. Courtes 1976:21) The macro-structural hypothesis has been unanimously recognized by the- orists who differ widely in their methodological approach: Todorov, Lari- vaille, Bremond, Greimas, van Dijk or Labov and Waletzky. I accept as a methodological starting point the hypothesis of semiotic levels which cor- responds to the three components of transformational and generative grammar. An analysis of the macro-structural model of conventional nar- rative should enable us to apprehend their relations: a. Semantic representation: the level of deep structures, the preselection - con- stitution of images of the "world" whose elementary constituents have a logical status; b. Superficial structures or deep syntactic structure: at this level, a semiotic grammar orders the contents into a discursive form. This ordering corre- sponds to logical structures Predicate (Arguments); c. Structures of manifestation, resulting from the projection of level b onto a material of expression. It is here that the signifiers are produced and organized. We know that the theoretical study of levels b and c remains the weak point of present discursive semiotics. I shall not recapitulate the macro-structural hypothesis of conventional narrative, nor the argumentative nature of narrative organization (Adam 1980), which should be examined in the light of Suleiman's works, the recent book by Louis Martin or Labov's theses on oral narrative. I shall therefore assume, for economy's sake, that level b is known and accepted, and I shall concentrate here on a + b on the one hand and on b + c on the other. I have chosen to adopt a descriptive method so as to have a concrete object of study for discussion. * Paper presented at Synopsis 2: "Narrative Theory and Poetics of Fiction," an international symposium held at the Porter Institute for Poetics and Semiotics, Tel Aviv University and the Van Leer Jerusalem Foundation, 16-22 June 1979.

IMPARFAIT AND PASSE SIMPLE: BETWEEN STRUCTURE OF MANIFESTATION AND DEEP SYNTACTIC MACRO-STRUCTURE? I should first of all make it clear that narrative is not limited to a communi- cation which operates on the basis of a conventional pattern (the narrative model with five basic propositions, organized hierarchically by what I have proposed to call the conjunctive structurator of the conventional narra- tive macro-(or super-)structure: CS.NMS). Effects that are manifested at the level of details (use of tenses, lexical investment of the speech act), that is, the local level of relations between sentences and/or sentence elements, must be related to the macro-structural organization, that is, to the level of narrative propositions (packets of sentences) or narrative sequences. The macro-structural model determines, from a cultural point of view, what may be called the competence of the reading subject as well as of writing. A double effect, that does not reduce the narrative statement to a standard performance, occurs simultaneously: both symbolic and historical, per- sonal investments continually shift, transform, even subvert the precon- structed narrative structures. 1.1 Macro (or super/-structural hypothesis Many evaluate fragments (present both in Beckett's Molloy and in the oral narrative studied by Labov) may disjoin narrative propositions and/or sequences, thus upsetting the conventional linearity of the narrative. This linearity can be formalized by distinguishing the first three organizational levels of the signifying material: Level 1 textual structurators (Str) #NT# Str/N Sql, NSq2,...NSqx-1, NSqx Level 2 sequential structurators (S') #NSq# Str'/NP1, NP2,...NPx-1, NPx. Level 3 propositional structurators (S") #NP# Str"/S1, S2,...Sx-1, Sx The macro-structural conjunctive structurator appears to be a kind of sequential structurator (level 2) among others, such as the basic conjunc- tive structurator in the order of conventional narrative. The second rule may thus be formulated: s, Ics J The sequential structurator which acts on the constituents of the sequence can be rewritten in the form of two sub-structurators: one conjunctive (CS), the other disjunctive (DS). DS manifests the dialogic, intertextual nature of any discourse; but although every discourse is composed of intertextual fragments in the wide sense, although it presupposes other discourses, heterogeneous by definition, paradoxically, all these dialogic sub-entities combine to construct a discourse and produce an isotopic text, to represent or constitute a world which is perceived or conceived as</page><page sequence="3">Macro-Structure of Conventional Narrative 137 homogeneous (see Genot 1978). The conventional narrative discourse is linked to the dominant effect produced by the conjunctive structurator (CS.NMS) which draws together and unifies the basic narrative proposi- tions. There is also a relation of precedence that puts the rewriting of the constituents into a linear order: {To precede} CS.Ord To follow The application of this operation leads to the terminal narrative propositions (NP) of the narrative tree and rule 2 is rewritten in the following manner: (2') #NSq# CS.NMS / (((((NP1) NP2) NP3) NP4) NP5) Each narrative macro-proposition (of a syntactic-semantic nature) appears as a hierarchically superior unit which regroups packets of propositions. Whereas narrative sequences are sometimes connected by the actors' spa- tial displacements, the link between the NP sequence and chronology is such that interpropositional connections are generally temporal. Thus, each NP of the children's story I have chosen, opens up on an indicator of the temporal continuity-contiguity: NP1 ="I1 y avait une fois .. ." ("Once upon a time ...") NP2="Un jour .. ." ("One day ...") NP3 ="Toute la journee . . ." ("All day long...") NP4= "Juste au moment o i le soleil s'enfonqait dans la mer ... ("Just when the sun was sinking into the sea ...") NP5 second part of the sentence which begins with: "Mais la nuit venue ..." ("But, when night had come ...") NP1 -Initial state (ISt) The initial NP is composed of: -the conventional temporal indicator "I1 y avait une fois" ("Once upon a time") ; -a series of predicates, comprising an equal number of being-statements in the imparfait; - actants-arguments: Youkou-Lili and her parents. Given the following actan- tial constellation: S1 (subject) = Youkou Lili, 01 (valued object) = her wooden doll, Al (sender) = the father. The mother of the little girl is but the adult double of the child (= Si') and the big brother is the father's double ( = Al'). The other temporal indicators ("toute la journee," "la nuit venue," "puis," ["all day long," "when night came," "then,"] that are also found in NP3 and NP5) do not constitute here the basis of autonomous NP because of the use of the imparfait (past continuous) instead of the passe simple, as will be dis- cussed later. The five sentences included in the larger unit NP1 are index- ical rather than functional. They define a situation of equilibrium, they delimit place and time and establish the characteristics of the actants. In the Petit livre d'or edition (No. 318, Paris, 1951), the five sentences are separated into four pages, the reading units being related to the icono- graphic illustrations; let us consider the following four lexies, each pre- ceded by a number:</page><page sequence="4">138 JEAN-MICHEL ADAM (1) I1 y avait une fois une petite fille qui s'appelait Youkou-Lili. (2) Elle avait sa maman, son papa and un grand frere. Ils habitaient tous ensemble une petite maison au toit de paille dans une belle ile au milieu des mers du Sud. Et toute la journee Youkou-Lili etait assise sur le sable et jouait avec la petite poup~e de bois que son papa lui avait faite. (3) Et la nuit venue, apris le souper, (4) Youkou-Lili emportait au lit sa poupee et la serrait bien fort dans ses bras, puis elles s'endormaient ensemble profondement. (1) Once upon a time there was a little girl called Youkou-Lili. (2) She had a mother, a father and a big brother. They all lived together in a small thatched house, on a beautiful island in the South Seas. And all day long, Youkou-Lili would sit on the sand and play with the little wooden doll that her father had made her. (3) And, when night had come, after supper, (4) Youkou-Lili would take her doll to bed and squeeze her tightly in her arms, then together they would fall fast asleep. This first NP corresponds to what Labov calls "orientation" in terms of time (when?), place (where?), character (who?), their activity and situation (what?). In relation to this initial NP of orientation, there must follow a description of one or more events that would answer the pragmatic con- straint of being noticeable and breaking the initial euphoria engendered by "the beautiful island [...]" (semes: lisolation/, /protectionl) "[...] in the South Seas" (semes: /heat/,/original liquid environment/). NP5-Final state (FSt) Before examing the core of the story, let us consider the final scene in rela- tion to NP1. The beginning and end of this story correspond to each other explicitly: [. . .] (14) et elle emporta sa chore petite poupee de bois dans son lit avec elle et elle la serra bien fort dans ses bras, (15) puis elles s'endormirent ensemble profondement. [...] (14) and she took her dear little wooden doll to bed with her, and she squeezed her tightly in her arms, (15) then together they fell fast asleep. The variations on the level of manifestation seem to be minimal, having to do with the transition from the imparfait ("emportait" ["would take'"]) to the passe simple ("emporta" ["took"]), and with the addition of certain indices meant to stress the precious nature of the valued object ("chere petite," ["dear little,'] "avec elle" ["with her']). The events constituting the story itself seem to bring about a return to the initial state. It is easy to verify that in the grammar of narrative, the final state is never absolutely identical to the initial state: something has always happened (even if only a certain lapse of time). In our example, the transformation amounts to a repetition of the same act differently, the dif- ference manifesting itself through the use of another tense. Although the fifth narrative proposition appears chronologically after all the others, it nevertheless conditions all the other propositions, that is, the entire narra- tive. It is here that all the transmissible signifieds are concentrated (which often makes the end of a text sound or read like the moral of a fable); all the events related lead to and affirm this NP; this is the narrative trap: the little girl's action, originally ordinary and inoffensive, becomes, at the end of the narrative, voluntary.</page><page sequence="5">Macro-Structure of Conventional Narrative 139 NP1 and NP5 correspond to the same knot of the narrative tree, regu- lated mainly by the semantic base (opposition of contents). The three other NPs are organized around the syntactic base: NP3 is the transformational core, which is either actional or evaluative; NP2 and NP4, that form the transformational operator, usually reverse their effects. I propose there- fore to reformulate the generative model, on the basis of van Dijk's narra- tive grammar: NS(CS.NMS) Story ("Histoire") controlled by its Final State (FSt) (NP5) Initial State ISt and TRANSFORMATIONAL SYNTAX (NP1) TRANSFORMATIONAL NPs bracketting 7ansformational or Evaluation Dynamics (TD) Inverted ransformational and Stabilized ITransformational (NP3) Force (TF1) Force (TF2) (NP2) (NP4) NP3 - TD action/evaluation This central NP, which specifies the (re)actions (sometimes simply mental) of the agent (or the narrator) of the episode, repeats the game'established in NP1 as the only doing (faire) of Youkou-Lili. Let us mention also the transition from the imparfait (NP1) to the passe simple (NP3) linked to the change: doll-valued object. (8 cont.) Toute la journ&amp;e Youkou-Lili joua avec sa nouvelle poup6e. Elle l'habillait et la d6shabillait et lui mettait des fleurs dans les cheveux. (9) Mais elle ne pouvait pas baigner sa nouvelle poup6e dans une baignoire de coquil- lages parce que l'eau lui faisait du mal. (10) Elle ne pouvait pas donner a sa nouvelle poup6e des pat6s de sable a manger, parce que le sable collait a ses cheveux. Elle ne pouvait pas mettre sa nouvelle poup6e dans une petite maison de sable parce qu'elle 6tait beaucoup trop grande pour y entrer. (8 cont.) All day long, Youkou-Lili played with her new doll. She would dress and undress her and put flowers in her hair. (9) But she could not wash her new doll in a bath made from a shell because water was bad for her. (10) She could not give her new doll sand patties to eat, because the sand stuck to her hair. She could not put her new doll in a small house of sand because she was too tall to enter it. NP2- TF1 and NP4- TF2: (5) Un jour aborda dans cette ile (6) un grand et beau voilier. (7) Un des hommes du grand navire vit Youkou-Lili qui jouait sur le sable avec sa poup6e, et il lui dit: "Petite fille, j'ai une surprise pour toi." (8) Et il lui donna une belle grande poup6e de porcelaine. La poup&amp;e avait des cheveux naturels, de grands yeux bleus et des vetements ravissants. (11) Juste au moment oif le soleil s'enfoncait dans la mer, le grand navire s'eloigna du rivage. Youkou-Lili descendit sur la plage (12) avec sa maman et son papa. Elle avait pris avec elle sa poup6e neuve pour dire adieu au gentil marin. (13) Mais la nuit venue elle d6posa sa poup~e neuve sur le plancher I . . . . 1 (5) One day there landed on this island (6) a big and beautiful sailing ship. (7) One of the men in the big ship saw Youkou-Lili Dlayinc with her doll on the</page><page sequence="6">140 JEAN-MICHEL ADAM sand, and he said to her: "Little girl, I have a surprise for you." (8) And he gave her a big and beautiful china doll. The doll had natural hair, big blue eyes and splendid clothes. (11) Just when the sun was sinking into the sea, the big ship sailed away from the shore. Youkou-Lili went down to the beach (12) with her mother and her father. She had taken her new doll with her to say good-bye to the nice sailor. (13) But when night had come, she laid her new doll on the floor [... ]. Let us note for the time being that the gift of the new doll (02) appears as a transformative doing (faire) (FT) to the disjunctive function: to give 02 to Youkou-Lili (Sl) means to disjoin her from 01 and from her field of values. In terms of narrative syntax, we move from the state of NP1 where [S1A 01] to the doing of NP1: FT (A2)=*[S1AO1)-- (S1AO2)=(S1V01)]. In NP2, we have therefore the appearance of the sailor's narrative program (02) aiming implicitly at transforming the conjunction (A) of Youkou-Lili with her parental-paternal valued object (01) into a disjunction (V). The parallel relation with NP4 structures the event between an arrival (NP2) which perturbs an initial state- of equilibrium and a departure (NP4) which brings back the former order, only slightly modified as we have seen. The pres- ence of lexie (13) in NP4 is of the utmost importance (despite the temporal limit which introduces a new NP) because it is here that Youkou-Lili's vol- untary act takes place, now that she is aware of what separates her from the imported valued object (02) and of her surroundings (big ship and nice sailor); hence the successive disjunctions: lexie (11) ="S'eloigna" ("sailed away"), lexie (12) = "dire adieu" ("say good-bye"), lexie (13) = "deposa sur le plancher" ("laid on the floor"). 1.2 Imparfait and Passe simple 1.2.1 Basic theoretical hypothesis The use of the passe simple, which is said to be defunct, is not surprising when occurring in a narrative utterance dominated by CS.NMS. The passe simple and this structurator contribute to the same narrative order; the stories they structure offer the image of a world which is constructed, elaborated, detached, reduced to its signifi- cant lines. In his Degr6 Z ro de l'6criture, Barthes writes: Through the preterite, the verb implicitly belongs with a causal chain, it par- takes of a set of related and orientated actions, it functions as the algebraic sign of an intention. Allowing as it does an ambiguity between temporality and causality, it allows for a sequence of events, that is, for an intelligible Narrative. That is why it is the ideal of Cosmogonies, myths, History and Novels (1967:30.). Marking the successive stages of the action, the pass&amp; simple, like the CS.NMS, traces a chain of events which is subjected to the causal principle and to succession, to the rectilinear, irreversible order of chronology. Despite what grammarians say, imparfait and passe simple are less "past tenses" than narrative tenses (when they appear together in historical utterance). "Corner stone of narrative" (Barthes), the passe simple marks the logical articulations while the imparfait fills in the interstices between car- dinal functions. The opposition between these two French tenses has to do with the textual "belligerence" that Genette or Ricardou deal with, in relation to the novel:</page><page sequence="7">Macro-Structure of Conventional Narrative 141 IMPARFAIT vs. PASSE SIMPLE descriptive statement vs. narrative statement being-statement vs. doing-statement indices and secondary vs. kernel functions functions (catalysers) (cardinals) When the entire story is told in the imparfait (see Marcotte 1976) the dis- course does not follow a causal chain which produces an intelligible link between the various events. The discourse is not apprehended in its global aspect, in its succession, but in its simultaneity. Its duration is built up within the time of the discourse. No event springs out of a life devoid of drama or passion; no incident occurs on this background of permanence (see Greimas 1976:71). Let us note down a new dichotomy which com- pletes the previous one: IMPARFAIT VS. PASSE SIMPLE /permanencel, Icontinuous/ /lincidencel, Idiscontinuous/ 1.2.2. Narrative macro-structure and verbal-temporal micro-structure. The imparfait is predominant in NP1 where it makes possible the establishment of a series of spatio-temporal informants and indices relating to characters. Moreover, it impresses upon the temporal aspect the stamp of perma- nence and gives the doing-statements a status which is indexical rather than functional and which assimilates them with being-statements. The first disruption: NP1 + I vs NP2 + PS (I = imparfait; PS = passe simple) corre- sponds to the appearance of an incident that generates the story as such. With the first occurrence of passe simple ("Un jour aborda" ["One day there landed']), a particular moment is extracted out of the cycle of insignificant days and becomes the object of the narrative. The grammatical subject of the three other occurrences of passe simple is the external agent who per- turbs permanence ("Une des hommes du grand navire ... il ... il ..." ["One of the men in the big ship .. . he .. . he ...']), and who, on the actantial level, is established as Addressor (A2) of an object (02 = big doll), thus reversing the relation of the father (Al) to the other valued object (01). The grammatical object is Youkou-Lili who is here still referred to in the imparfait. The acts related in passe simple form a triad: 1. A2 vit (saw) 2. A2 dit a (said to) Youkou-Lili- S1 3. A2 donna 02 (gave 02 to) The ship and the sailor are described in the passe simple, whereas the two uses of imparfait concern: 1. In lexie 7, Youkou-Lili whose doing corresponds to the initial state of paradisal permanence and to her status of patient in the narrative proposi- tion: AGENT = PS Incident and main action taken out of the causal chain (triadic): one event calls for another event VS PATIENT = I Secondary action which defines permanence: same verb and same tense as in NP1</page><page sequence="8">142 JEAN-MICHEL ADAM 2. In lexie 8, the new doll, following a narrative succession of the type (doll given-described). The description of the new doll is developed, also on a triadic basis: WHOLE belle grande poup6e de porcelaine (beautiful big china doll) la poupee avait (the doll had) PART des cheveux naturels (natural hair) de grands yeux bleus (big blue eyes) des vetements ravissant (splendid clothes) The transition from NP2 to NP3 is ensured by a new saliency: end of NP2 = I-beginning of NP3= PS. The verb jouer ("to play") appears now in the passe simple: TO PLAY with 01 (NP1 - NP2) = Imparfait Ipermanencel vs TO PLAY with 02 (NP3) Passe simple lincident/ The incident, the new and exceptional fact of playing with another doll, launches a long series of imparfaits, that is, of actions which try to establish a new permanence: (A): 1. habillait (would dress) + 2. deshabillait (would undress) + 3. mettait (would put) BUT (B): 1. elle ne pouvait pas (she could not) baigner (wash) 2. elle ne pouvait pas donner (give) [...] 3. elle ne pouvait pas metter (put) [...] BECAUSE (C): 1. faisait (was bad) [...] + 2. collait (would stick) [...] + 3. 6tait (was) [...] The new permanence (the three imparfaits of series A) clashes with an impossibility (the triad of series B) whereas series C explains the impossibility of the game, the impossible doing. In other words, the failure of the attempt to install a new permanence (series A) is made evident, before being explicated (series C), by the use of the infinitive, a nominal mode which does not insert the game within a given time or in relation to an actant and cancels it as real doing (series B). The imparfait that opens NP4 gives the temporal informant soir ("evening"), end of the ("a") day. The relation between NP2 and NP4 is indicated by the passe simple: NP2 = ABORDA ... un grand .. voilier (LANDED ... a big ... sailing ship) NP4 = le grand navire SELOIGNA (the big ship SAILED AWAY) I have already pointed out the logic consecution of the incidence arrival -departure Youkou-Lili's action is made evident by the passe simple (descendit [came down]) and the past perfect (elle avait pris [...] sa poup&amp;e neuve [she had taken (...) her new doll]). It differs from her previous acts, as the infinitive shows: "pour dire adieu" ("to say good-bye"). The two passes simples</page><page sequence="9">Macro-Structure of Conventional Narrative 143 establish a link between the little girl and the sun (coming down), that is the natural aspect of a conjunction "pris AVEC elle" ("taken WITH her") (02 &gt; S1) which prepares a double disjunction: S1 &gt; A2 + S1 &gt; 02. This last disjunction (in contrast with the conjunction S1 &gt;02 which is in the past perfect and therefore recessed) is established in the passe simple (the third PS of the NP), that is defined as a voluntary and conscious act (new inci- dent foregrounded by the narrative) performed by the actant heroine who has become, at the end of the narrative, a full subject, capable of opposing the implicit narrative program of actant A2 and of his disjunctive action. The fact that NP5 is articulated around the three other pass simples is not surprising: the triadic rhythm has already been mentioned and the presence of the passe simple at the terminal states of the conventional narratives corresponds to the macro-structural fact that all narratives are controlled by and from their end. What comes chronologically after (NP5) is, from the logical-argumentative point of view, situated before: what the narrative wants to demonstrate, establish as novelty (NP1 + I = permanence vs. NP5 + PS = incident), is put at the end of the narrative and formulated in the passe simple. The passage from the imparfait to the passe simple gives the same acts a new value: we pass from an imparfait that centers on Youkou-Lili the features [- agent] and [+ being] to a passe simple that now transforms her traits into [+ agent] and [+ doing]. These traits give the final choice the value of a voluntary act [+ doing], performed by a subject who is both active and autonomous. From NP1-ISt to NP5-FSt, the little girl has transformed her acts (her doing) into willing (to be the girl/doll father has made, to keep to the pattern?). This reads as an acquisition of knowledge: the initial permanence is good, valuable and undeceitful; the narrative logic induces this type of submission to the initial, paternal order (permanence) and presents it as the free conquest of the heroine. The family institution indeed appears in this case as a factor of regulation, reproduction, permanence. For want of space, I shall not develop here the analysis of the micro- structural, lexico-syntactical level (see Adam, forthcoming). The repetitions of syntagms and lexemes mark the progression from one narrative proposition to another. Within the macro-structural mould, they confirm the relations between the micro-structural local effects and the global effects induced by CS.NMS. 2. MACRO-STRUCTURE AND ELEMENTARY STRUCTURE OF MEANING 2.1. Macro-Structure and reversal of contents When Greimas defines narrative as an algorithm i.e. "a succession of utter- ances whose functions-predicates simulate, linguistically, a set of conducts orientated towards a goal" (1970:187), he brings to light the temporal dimension of narrative discourse. This makes it possible to oppose a before to an after corresponding to an inversion of the situation; on the level of implicit structure, this means an inversion of the signs of the content. Hence the following correlation:</page><page sequence="10">144 JEAN-MICHEL ADAM BEFORE inverted content (ISt and TF1) AFTER stabilized content (FSt and TF2) This formula has been criticized for being either too extreme (Rastier 1973:163) or too specific, "many texts do not observe the inversion of con- tents" (Chabrol 1973:17). These objections, though justified, become, how- ever, less evident if we relate the inversion of contents to the role of CS.NMS. As Rastier points out, technological discourse replaces one con- tent by another: assembly instructions replace the dispersed (term of departure) by the solidary (term of arrival); cooking recipes appear as a substitution of raw by cooked. However, this substitution is not an articula- tion of contents in the form of paradigmatic oppositions or syntagmatic succession. These contents are not subjected to any dialectical operation. (Rastier 1973:179). On the contrary, it is necessary to consider the five elementary NPs of the basic narrative sequence as a syntagmatic articulation of contents. The inverted "before" (i.e., the content that must be modified) is transformed through an agent of transformation, into a stabilized "after." In his "Ele- ments pour une interpretation du recit mythique," Greimas (1970:187) con- siders narration as a whole in which a hierarchical structure of content is necessary. Myths, tales, theater plays have a common structural charac- teristic: a dichotomous correlation. To these correlative contents (St1 and St2y, the one inverted, the other stabilized, topic-contents are juxtaposed that constitute the transformational operator of the sequence; here, too, one is stabilized, the other inverted, so that the same kind of transforma- tion takes place. I propose the following articulation for the model of the ordered sequence: CONTENTS INVERTED CONTENT I STABILIZED CONTENT initial correlative topic topic final correlative NARRATIVE PROPOSITIONS NP1 NP2 NP3 NP4 NP5 PROPOSITIONS The fact that the topic-content is thus divided into three may be explained by referring to the example by Horst Isenberg, often quoted by text grammarians: Three years ago, I went out for a walk with my brother. We were strolling in the streets of Leipzig and weren't paying much attention to traffic. Suddenly, my brother shoved me. We had meant to cross an intersection without pay- ing any attention. The lights were green. Nevertheless my brother and I reached the other side of the road in time. Since that day, I do not cross a road when the lights are green. The initial situation corresponds to a NP of inverted correlative content, as indicated by the negation at the end of the second sentence. NP5 consists of a stabilized final correlative content-the "without paying any attention" of NP1 (repeated in NP3) becomes the conclusive moral statement: "since</page><page sequence="11">Macro-Structure of Conventional Narrative 145 that day ...". In the light of NP5 (after), NP1 (before) is read as a state of inexperience. At the end of the narrative, a certain knowing seems to have been acquired. At this stage, it seems possible to consider the initial cor- relative content as a disjunction (inversion) of the narrating subject from an implicit valued object which would be the attention; it can be read as an amelioration to be obtained, to use Bremond's terminology. The transforma- tion of the hero-narrator who in NP1 is inexperienced, irrational (all these being adult values transmitted and imposed by school, by family) into the wise, reasonable, grown-up child of NP5 (an "amelioration" obtained in the domain of educational values) passes through the articulation of two func- tional triads: AMELIORATION TO BE OBTAINED PROCESS - DEGRADATION TO BE AVOIDED PROCESS DEGRADATION AVOIDED AMELIORATION OBTAINED CONTENTS INVERTED CONTENTS, NEGATIVE DEIXIS STABILIZED CONTENTS, POSITIVE DEIXIS correlative content topic-content topic-content correlative (cognitive dimension) (pragmatic dimension) (pragmatic dimension) content (cognitive dimension) TRIADS Amelioration to be Potential process Degradation Amelioration obtained degradation of degr. avoided obtained NARRATIVE PROPOSITIONS NP1 NP2 NP3 NP4 NP5 SENTENCES S1+S2 $ S4+S5 S3 S6 S7 The "moral" (NP5) conters meaning to the rest ot the narrative and on the topic-content by establishing a relation between the narrated episode as such (NP2 + NP3 + NP4) and that which frames it (the correlative contents fixed in NP1 and NP5). 2.2 Macro-structure and semiotic square 2.2.1: A prose poem by Baudelaire. As a starting point let us use for discus- sion this short prose poem by Baudelaire: LE DESESPOR DE LA VIEILLE La petite vieille ratatinee se sentit toute rejouie en voyant ce joli enfant a qui chacun faisait fete, a qui tout le monde voulait plaire; ce joli etre, si fragile comme elle, la petite vieille, et, comme elle aussi, sans dents et sans cheveux. Et elle s'approcha de lui, voulant lui faire des risettes et des mines agreables. Mais l'enfant epouvante se debattait sous les caresses de la bonne femme decrepite, et remplissait la maison de ses glapissements. Alors la bonne vieille se retira dans sa solitude 6ternelle, et elle pleurait dans un coin, se disant:</page><page sequence="12">146 JEAN-MICHEL ADAM - "Ah! pour nous, malheureuses vieilles femelles, l'age est passe de plaire, meme aux innocents; et nous faisons horreur aux petits enfants que nous voulons aimer!" THE OLD WOMAN'S DESPAIR The shrunken little old woman rejoiced when she saw this pretty child whom everybody was cuddling, whom all wanted to please; this charming creature, as frail as the little old woman, and as herself too, toothless and hairless. And she moved closer to him, wanting to smile affectionately at him. But the child, terrified, was struggling under the caresses of the decrepit old woman, and filling the house with his shrieks. So the good old woman retired into her eternal solitude, and she was crying in a corner, thinking to herself: -"Ah! the time has passed for us, miserable old females, when we could please, even the innocents; and we fill with horror the little children whom we want to love!" On first reading, this text does tell us the development of a subject from a certain event (meeting) seen in its consecutiveness, both logical and tem- poral. This narrative seems to obey to an argumentative logic: Proposition M (pars. 1-2) (conclusion C: euphoria) BUT proposition N (par. 3) (conclusion non C: dysphoria ) SO conclusion (par. 4) (conclusion non C: dysphoria) The relation of the title to the text strongly resembles a relation of the metonymic explication of the effect (the title dysphoria: "despair") by the cause (the narrative states the cause and connects the effects). In other words the poem/narrative answers the question: Why is the old woman desperate? why "the old woman's despair"? Or, again: Why non C? Because an event (C) has been followed by a contradictory event ("but" non C), which is cause ("so") of final conclusion. A link between cause and con- sequence, but introduces a clear-cut change in this text. Let us consider the following: NP1 + NP2/but/NP3 / so / NP4 + NP5 Three actants can be identified in the first sentence S1 =the little old woman, S2 = the pretty child, S3 = everybody = all. The following thematic roles appear in this order: Sl: old woman = little, shrunken, joyful, frail, toothless, hairless. S2: child= charming creature, frail, toothless, hairless. We can assume the affirmation of an identity which unites S1 and S2, who are otherwise opposed as youth is opposed to old age: /+ life/ vs. / - life/. This similarity seems to confer on S1 a competence, a capacity to please S2. For this competence to be complete, S1 must acquire a wanting and a know- ing how to please, these being indispensable modalities. As opposed to S1 and S2, the collective actant S3 remains undefined; it represents the others. S1 situated outside the relation, sees S2, S3 is in conjunction with S2 ("faisait fete" ["was cuddling']):</page><page sequence="13">Macro-Structure of Conventional Narrative 147 S1 V S2 AS3 If we examine the doing-statements, after the being-statements, we realize that only S3 has a narrative program: voulait plair (wanted to please) NP1-ISt (Manipulation, cognitive and persuasive dimension) In the first paragraph, S1 is established as subject of the narrative, by the use of the passe simple. On the contrary, both the doing and the wanting (NP1) of S3 is in the imparfait. The NP of S3 is doubly recessed: on the level of manifestation by the use of the imparfait, and on the level of macro- structure by its position in the initial state and not in the first transforma- tion (NP2). Within this "orientation," and in relation to a valued object which would be Ijoyl or / euphorial, the conjunction is generalized: S1 AO A S2-S3 NP2-TF1 (Competence, doing - pragmatic dimension) In the second paragraph, S1, who considers herself integrated into the collective actant S3 and invested with the modality power to please, acquires the modality wanting to please of S3, and borrows, so to speak, its narrative program from it. This second NP amounts therefore to the con- stitution of the narrative program of S1. There must now be the modality knowing how to please, so that S1 may pass from competence to perform- ance and accomplish its narrative program. NP1 and NP2 are connected on the level of manifestation by and which is stressed due to its position at the beginning of the second paragraph; it is less a coordinator than the index of a linking between the two NPs. It marks the logical consecutive- ness from a NP1 where the conjunctions S1A S2 is only rhetorical (level of the utterance of a comparable state) to a NP2 where the desire of con- junction is actualized in a doing-statement: "elle s'approcha" ("she moved closer"). The passe simple stresses the transformational-functional character of the doing of S1 in NP2, while the same passe simple insisted, in NP1, on the statement of a basic state: S1 AOjo NP3-FT (performance, doing-pragmatic dimension) The third paragraph develops the consequences of NP2 and the failure of the narrative program of Sl; a failure which is due to an insufficient com- petence: absence of knowing how to please and denial of being able to please. The grammatical subject of the statement is no longer S1 but S2 (S2 acquir- ing the semes [+ animated] = se ddbattait (was struggling) and [- human] = ses glapissements (his shrieks) and the verbs are in the imparfait. The pas- sage of the thematic role "ratatinee" ("shrunken") to "decrepite" ("decrepit") reinforces the degradation and the contrast between S1 and S2, and even transforms their initial similarity (which ensured the modality being able to please) into a difference: the loss of the being able to do and the failure of the performance. It is possible here to state that the narrative program of S1 is inverted: wanting to please, she terrifies. As a competent operating subject of a transformative doing, S1 leads S2 from a state of conjunction with the semes [+animated] [+human], i.e. humanity ("joli enfant," "joli atre" ["pretty child," "charming creature']), to a state of disjunction from the</page><page sequence="14">148 JEAN-MICHEL ADAM seme [+ human], to the extent that "shrieks" establishes animality. This does not constitute a proper narrative program with acquisition of modalities, but a transformation of the state of S2 between NP1 and NP3 under the action of the transformative doing (FT) of S1. NP4- FT2 (Sanction) At the beginning of the fourth paragraph, introduced by "Alors" ("then"), the pragmatic doing of S1 is transformed into a cognitive doing (which is here interpretative). S1 draws from the preceding NP and from the failure of its borrowed narrative program (2) a precise knowing of its condition. She begins by disjoining herself from the other actants: Narrative Program 2: FT (Sl) * [(S1A S2 + S3) -(S1 V S2 + S3)] This narrative program is marked by S1 returning to be the subject of a verb in the passe simple: "la bonne vielle se retira" ("the good old woman retired"). Just as NP2 marked the operation of a narrative program and the statement of a conjunctive doing ("s'approcha" ["moved closed']), NP4 marks the operation of another narrative program and a doing-statement which is here disjunctive ("se retira" ["retired']). The opposition between these two-NPs confirms the inversion of contents. NP5-FSt (Sanction- Cognitive and interpretative dimension) The end of the second paragraph, introduced by the connector and, indexes again the transition between a state and a transformation in the form of narrative program: TF1 of NP2= NP1 &amp; TF2 of NP4= NP2. We have the following parallel structure: NP1 and NP2 // NP4 and NP5 The transformation of the state is accomplished: stated in the imparfait ("elle pleurait" ["she was crying']): ISt = (S1A Ojoy) = FSt = (S1 V Ojoy) The fact that the conjunctive narrative program is abandoned establishes the absence of social integration in S1. The first narrative program appears as a sort of test given (manipulation) by S3 (in this case, a donor-recipient actant) to S1 in the form of pleasing. The failure to pass this social test of seduction (a failure caused in part by the reaction of S2 who assumes then the role of the opposing actant) determines the final decision of S1 and the "moral" as such. In the form of a discourse, this stretches the individual adventure to the dimensions of a collective figuration: "nous" ("us"). The being-statement "malheureuses vieilles femelles" ("miserable old females") confirms the degradation of Sl: ISt: "r6jouie" FSt. "malheureuses" ("rejoiced") = leuphorial ("miserable") = /dysphoria/ (S1AO)1o) (S1 V Oj ISt: "la vieille" ("the old woman") - FSt: "femelles" ("females") S1= [+ human] S1= [- human] Thus we have the same degradation as that suggested by the lexeme "glap-</page><page sequence="15">Macro-Structure of Conventional Narrative 149 inated in NP5 since we have: "petits enfants" ("little children"). This narrative (which I have analyzed only briefly in order to introduce the following theoretical point) is the articulation of two semiotic squares in the same macro-structural pattern: EUPHORIA DYSPHORIA (NP1) I (NP5) *= (NP2) = (NP4) DYSPHORIA EUPHORIA (NP3) The poles of this first semiotic square are articulated, on the level of man- ifestation and through their position in a narrative by the conjunctive structurator CS.NMS, by five verbs in the forme pronominale: ELEMENTARY NARRATIVE MANIFESTATION STRUCTURE MACRO- OF MEANING STRUCTURE /euphoria/ ................ NP1- ISt ... "se sentit toute rejouie" (Si) ("rejoiced") /euphoria/ -l/euphoria ...... NP2- TF2 ... "s'approcha" (S1-S2) ("moved closer") /euphoria/ ................ NP3- TD ... "se debattait" (S2) {"was struggling") /euphoria/l- /dysphoria/ .... NP4- TF2 ... se retira" (S1) ("retired") /dysphoria/ ............... NP5- FSt ... "se disant" (S1) ("thinking to herself") A second semiotic square is superimposed on the first to situate the initial joy-euphoria in the field of appearance: EUPHORIA-APPEARING DYSPHORIA-BEING DYSPHORIA-BEING EUPHORIA-APPEARING In this story, which recounts the impossible integration of one who can no longer pass the test par excellence of socialization (i.e., to please), and who can do nothing but retire from the narrative, the sequence of narrative propositions leads from one pole of the semiotic square to another pole, through an orientated, ineluctable course. What turns this text into a nar- rative is not the elementary structure of meaning, but the superimposition of this deep semantic structure and a macro-textual narrative structure, the projection of the semantic representation onto a deep syntactic (text- ual) structure. In order to develop this demonstration still further, let us return briefly to the short text studied above. 2.2.2. Return to the narrative by Horst Isenberg. Generally speaking, the narrative is the articulation of two contrary spaces, of two deixis, as Greimas has formulated:</page><page sequence="16">150 JEAN-MICHEL ADAM NEGATIVE DEIXIS vs. POSITIVE DEIXIS (inverted content) (stabilized content) If we move from the syntactic level of the order of the NP to the semantic level, we must double each of the two spaces and set up various types of relations organized by the three axes of the semiotic square. El (2) E2 SI'E (2 (1) = contradictory (3) (2) = contrary (3) = implication E2 (2) El The circuit, inside the square, can be schematized thus: A B B A B-A = operation of assertion or implication A -A = operation of negation A - B = operation of assertion B- X = operation of negation These operations, related to the deep semantic structurator, are articu- lated, in the narrative text, into operations of narrativization of the contents manipulated by CS.NMS. If it is possible to move from an initial state Stl to a final state St2 through the intermediary Stl, it means that there is no fundamental opposition between the binarism of the square and the ternarism of the narrative macro-structure. It is necessary, indeed, to add to these three posts, two transformations: tl= Stl, Stl and t2= St1, St2. In the text by Horst Isenberg, this is exemplified in the fol- lowing manner: CARELESSNESS Stl ---- St2 ATTENTION (to go for a walk, I to stroll) INATTENTION St-- ----Sti DANGER Stl = State of security, related however by implication to inattention = NP1 Stl - Stl = transformation 1 = NP2 Stl = Evaluation of the danger: to cross the road when the lights are green for the cars. = NP3 Stl1- St2 = transformation 2 = NP4 St2= Final state in which attention and experience replace the initial carelessness = NP5</page><page sequence="17">Macro-Structure of Conventional Narrative 151 2.2.3 The death of John the Baptist, St. Mark VI, 14-29. All translations divide the passage into two parts: the first, for example, from verse 14 to verse 16 is entitled "Herod et Jesus" ("Herod and Jesus"); the second covering verses 17-29: "Execution de Jean-Baptiste" ("Execution of John the Baptist"). The Gospel of Luke does not relate the execution, Matthew's story, however, (14' 2 and 14312) is structured in the same way as Mark's. I propose to start from the following hypothesis: the story 17-29 is embedded as a retrospective story within the framing story: 14-16. Let us start then from the embedded story which constitutes a whole. Here is the text: MARC VI - 14-29 (14) Le roi Herode entendit parler de Jesus car son nom etait devenu celbre. On disait : Jean le Baptiste est ressuscite des morts; voil&amp; pourquoi le pouvoir de faire des miracles agit en lue." (15) D-autres disaient : "C'est Elie." D'autres disaient : "C'est un prophete semblable a l'un de nos prophetes." (16) En entendant ces propos, Herode disait : "Ce Jean que j'ai fait d&amp;capiter, c'est lue qui est ressuscite." (17) En effet, Herode avait fait arreter Jean et l'avait enchaine en prison, ' cause d'Herodiade, la femme de son frere Philippe qu'il avait 6pousee.(18). Car Jean disait ' Herode: "I1 ne test pas permis d'avoir la femme de ton frere." (19) Quant a Herodiade, elle etait acharnme contre lui et voulait le faire mourir, mais elle n'y parvenait pas, (20) parce qu'Herode craignait Jean, sachant que c'etait un homme juste et saint,et il le protegeait. Quand il l'avait entendu, il restait fort perplexe; ce pendant il l'ecoutait volontiers. (21) Mais un jour propice arriva lorsque Herode, pour son anniversaire, donna un banquet a ses dignitaires, a ses officiers et aux notables de Galilee. (22) La fille de cette Herodiade vint executer une danse et elle plut ' Herode et a ses convives. Le roi dit ' la jeune fille: "Demande-moi ce que tu veux et je te le donnerai." (23) Et il lue fit ce serment "Tout ce que tu demanderas je te le donnerai, serait-ce la moitie de mon royaume." (24) Elle sortit et dit A sa mire: "Que vais-je lui demander?" Celle-ci repondit: "La tate de Jean le Baptiste." (25) En toute hate, elle rentra aupres du roi et lui demanda: "Je veux que tu me donnes tout de suite sur plat la tate de Jean le Baptiste." (26) Le roi devint triste, mais a cause de son serment et des convives it ne voulut pas lui refuser. (27) Aussitot le roi envoya un garde avec l'ordre d'apporter la tate de Jean. Le garde alla le decapiter dans sa prison, (28) il apporta la tate sur un plat, il la donna ' la jeune fille, et la jeune fille la donna ' sa mire. (29) Quand ils l'eurent appris, les disciples de Jean vinrent prendre son cadavre et le deposerent dans un tombeau (Traduction TOB). St. Mark VI - 14-29 (14) And king Herod heard of Him (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said that John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him. (15) Other said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of ihe prophets. (16) But when Herod heard thereof, he said It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead (17)-For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her (18). For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife. (19) Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not: (20) For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly. (21) And when a con- venient day was come that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords,</page><page sequence="18">152 JEAN-MICHEL ADAM high captains, and chief estates of Galilee; (22) And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee. (23) And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom. (24) And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist. (25) And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist. (26) And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her. (27) And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison, (28) And brought his head in a charger and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother. (29) And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb (from the King James' version). 2.2.3.1. Macro-structural syntactic structure If the death of John the Baptist is a narrative and if the embedded narra- tive constitutes a whole, then we should be able to find at least one com- plete narrative sequence. This is indeed the case: 17-20 = NP1, 21-23 = NP2, 24= NP3, 25-27=/NP4, 28-29/=NP5. Only NP1 is in the imparfait. The breaking of the initial state, the beginning of the narrative as such is marked, on the level of manifestation, by the passage from the imparfait (permanence) to the passe simple (incident). The imparfaits situate the actants, define the state and the narrative programs. The following characters appear in chronological order: Herod (= S), John (=S2), Herodias (= S3). From the point of view of the Jewish symbolic code, S2 denounces the incestuous union between S1 and S3. This denunciation triggers off the first narrative program, that of S3: have S2 killed, that is, the violence of human aggression which is so often portrayed and denounced in the Old and New Testaments: Narrative Program 1= FT(S3) = [(S2 A 0) - (S2 V O)] in which O = life. S3 has the wanting ("would have killed him"), but not the knowledge and still less the being able ("but she could not") because of the anti-program of S1 who inclines toward keeping S2 alive, and therefore to prevent a stronger violence than want of freedom; Narrative Program 2 (S1) = (S2AO) In fact, S1 "sait" ("knows") that S2 is "juste et saint" ("just and holy"), that is, conjoined to Jewish Law [S2 A Law] from which he himself is disjoined because of his marriage: [S1-S3 V Law], if we believe John's words on the symbolic order of the Law which determines kinship relationships. In addition to this knowledge, S1 has the power and the wanting ('et il le protegeait" ["and observed him"]). His Narrative Program is stronger than the Narrative Program of Herodias. The second NP makes possible the transformation of the initial state in which the second narrative program is dominant. A new actant, S4, "la fille de cette H&amp;rodiade" ("the daughter of the said Herodias)", brings about the establishment of a contract. In uniting himself, by contract, to the wanting of S4, S1 loses his power, or at least the power which enabled him to domi- nate Narrative Program 1. It is during a supper and a dance (circles of</page><page sequence="19">Macro-Structure of Conventional Narrative 153 desire, of the body) that the inversion is prepared and that the "blemish" appears (to use F. Belo's expression in his Lecture mat6rialiste de l'Evangile de Marc (1975). In NP3 (marked by the exit of S4, just as NP4 opens with her return during the supper) the narrative makes it clear that though, S4 has obtained a power, this power is not coupled with any wanting. In NP3, S3 associates her knowledge and her wanting with the power of her daughter (S4) so that her own narrative program may be achieved. In NP4 (second transformation, movement from the acquisition of com- petence to performance, parallelism stressed by a return to the same place of desire, supper and body) S4 says "je veux" ("I will") and S1 loses his power, his program being reduced to nil because of his oath: "he would not reject her." He thus enables the realization of Narrative Program 1. In verse 27, it can be said that the words of S1 ("1'ordre" ["the command'l) are followed by an effect ("le garde alla le decapiter" ["and he went and beheaded him'l), that his discursive doing is performative (when he speaks, he [someone] acts): Narrative Program 1 (S1+ S3+ S4) =* [(S2 A O)- (S2 V 0)] Finally, in NP5, the success of Narrative Program 1 leads to the death of S2: [S2 V O]. Let us add that S2 changes position by moving from prison (which disjoins him from his original community) to the banquet (his head, at least, follows this course on the charger), that is, to the circle of desire and of the body, then of the tomb. He then becomes once again con- joined to his community: "les disciples de Jean vinrent prendre son cadavre" ("the disciples [...] came and took up his corpse)". 2.2.3.2 Semantic-discursive structure of the embedded narrative The passage from El (place of equilibrium between contrary NP tensions) to E2 is performed through a median term El and two transformations LAW Stl-LIFE St2-DEATH (NP1) I  (NP5) NP2 NEGATIVE NP4) POSITIVE DEIXIS DEIXIS (Narrative (Narrative Program 2) Program 1) St2-DEATH Stl-LIFE ( (NP3) BLEMISH NP2, NP3 and NP4 render the passage through non-life possible, that is, on the one hand the Narrative Program 1 of Herodias, on the other hand the place of the banquet, of desire, of pleasure, where that which made life possible is inverted by the oath-contract: Narrative Program 2= life + no death. I put Narrative Program 2 in the neative deixis because it is an anti-program (in relation to his wife's program). The two programs are both under the sign of the "blemish"; only Narrative Program 2 keeps</page><page sequence="20">154 JEAN-MICHEL ADAM John the Baptist in a state of non-death. The narrative belongs to those who are blemished: they are masters of the Narrative Program. 2.2.3.3. The framing narrative (VI, 17-29) The evangelical discourse is characterized by the addition of a meaning (from a cognitive-discursive doing) to what becomes essentially a signifier (here, the embedded narrative). Were it not for this grafting of a precise signified on to the signifier this narrative would remain strange. Only the presence of fate could have been discerned, to the extent that the passage from NP1 to NP2 ("un jour propice" ["a convenient day"]) and the reversal of Herod's Narrative Program take place outside the will of Herodias who has emitted Narrative Program 1. Herodias does not order her daughter to dance with the purpose of seducing and beguiling Herod into giving up Narrative Program 2. The first NPs follow each other logically, but, at least up to NP3, outside the initiative of the subjects. This explains why John the Baptist, S2 subject of being par excellence, appears as the hero in the titles which are usually given to his passage. In relation to the Law, his sole doing is discursive, its effect being to trigger off the Narrative Program. The narrative becomes that of a man subjected to a transcendant order and to the temporary triumph of the forces of desire (of the "blemish"). In fact, this is inverted by the discursive order of the semiotic square constituted by the framing narrative. The latter contains five references to the spoken word: (on) (they) +parler (talked): Jesus=Jesus on (they) + disait (said): Jean la Baptiste est ressuscite + fait des miracles (John the Baptist is risen from the dead + mighty works show forth in him) d'autres (others) + disaient (said): C'est Elie (it is Elias) d'autres (others) + disaient (said): C'est un prophete (it is a prophet) Herod + disait (said): Jean le Baptiste est ressuscit {(John is risen from the dead) At this point in the text, Herod is defined as having realized NP1: "it is John whom I beheaded." His discourse brings about a complete traversal of the first square: St1-LIFE ------------- St2-DEATH t4/21 Jt2 St2-DEATHL------------ LIFE-St1 The first and second transformations (tl = NP2 and t2 = NP4) refer to the embedded narrative whereas the two others belong to the framing discur- sive part: t3 =JB is not dead: DEATH--t3--DEATH, t4=JB is risen from the dead: DEATH--t4--LIFE. If we couple this square with a square of "veridication" death is an appearing and we must go beyond the apparent end of the narrative (appearing) to a being: the resurrection. The evangel- ical discourse appears here again as a narrative which gives rise to an interpretative doing. From Herod's discursive and faulty resurrection</page><page sequence="21">Macro-Structure of Conventional Narrative 155 ("John [...] is risen from the dead"= lie: APPEARING + BEING) we must pass to the figure of another resurrection, which will occur in the future, that of Jesus (BEING + APPEARING). In the evangelical text we learn that the disciples are in the secret of this resurrection (BEING + APPEARING); at any rate, Herod's commentary must be extended, dis- placed by the reader who is used to doing this in a text which contains a large number of parallelisms: JB // JC: supper // the Last Supper, the cir- cle of the elders of the court // circle of the apostles, dance, space of the body, of desire // communion, etc. 3. CONCLUSION- THEORETICAL REAPPRAISAL 3.1 Narrative Macro-Propositions The preceding pages illustrate a way to approach certain narrative texts through semiotic practice. Among the questions that have arisen (see Adriaens 1979) I have chosen to develop here the theorization of the macro-structural hypothesis. Given the present state of research, it seems to me necessary to start with the narrative macro-propositions (NP above) which constitute the macro- (or super-) structure of the conventional narrative. The study of these macro-propositions can reveal the argumen- tative basis of the conventional narrative. Thus, it seems to me possible to claim that "narrative is a trap," not only on the level of speech-act struc- tures (structures enonciatives) that has been so well studied by Louis Marin (1979), but also on the level of the deep textual macro-structure. As we know, narratologists (Barthes 1977, Greimas 1970, Todorov 1969 and 1971) define proposition as the smallest narrative unit and usually consider Propp's function ("predicate" in Todorov) as too rudimentary a unit. The proposition combines function with one (several) actant(s), sequence being a series of propositions following each other and text a com- bination of sequences (which I described above). Researchers agree that propositions are organized in cycles (sequences), recognized by the reader who is thus endowed with a kind of textual narrative competence. For Todorov, a narrative sequence is composed of several propositions and gives the reader the impression of a complete whole, a story, an anecdote. For Labov (in a radically different discursive field, since he deals with "narratives of personal experience" or "black vernacular narratives" col- lected in Harlem) the narrative is one means, among others, to recapitulate past experience, and it is characterized by the fact that its clauses follow a temporal order (1972:360-361) In Therapeutic Discourse, he develops the idea of a rule of "narrative sequencing" (1977:107). For him, any sequence of two propositions which are temporally organized (united and separated by a temporal junction) constitute a minimal narrative. Thus: a. I know a boy named Harry. b. Another boy threw a bottle at him right in the head c. and he had to get seven stitches (Labov 1972:361). Since proposition a is not followed by any temporal junction, it can be placed anywhere and constitutes what Labov calls a free proposition. On the contrary, b and c are narrative propositions. To me, this utterance appears rather as a summary of the argument of what may eventually</page><page sequence="22">156 JEAN-MICHEL ADAM become a narrative: it looks like the "summary" proposition which Labov himself deals with, a proposition that sometimes opens a narrative: "I am going to tell you the story of a boy named Harry who was hit in the head with a bottle and had to get seven stitches." In fact, Labov's propositions, connected with manifestation and with the segmentation of the realized utterance, do not correspond to my macro- propositions. I shall try here to link Labov's theses with the macro- structural hypotheses since they seem to me to be complementary. Horst Isenberg's example, quoted above, helps to detect with P1 and P2 the macro-propositional unit formed by two propositions which are here free. These two sentences give the necessary "orientation" in terms of: 1. time: "three years ago" 2. place: "the streets of Leipzig"' 3. argument-actants: "I," "my brother" 4. predicates: "go for a walk," "stroll," "not to pay any attention to the traffic" This proposition of "orientation" is not limited only to the indexical data referred to by Labov: "Each narrative typically begins with reference to time, place, persons, and behavior characteristic of the situation" (1977:106). In deep structure, the initial state is also correlated with the final content; moreover, it is inverted in relation to it. We have seen that this is indeed the case in Horst Isenberg's example. In Youkou-Lili and her new doll the free propositions seem to be linked by a temporal junction in sentence 4 and sentence 5 ("and," "then"). In fact, because of the imparfait, the temporal junction does not function here as a causal and logical orientation of the events related in the narration. Labov points out that Clauses containing used to, would, and the general present are not narrative clauses and cannot support a narrative (Labov 1972:326). This appears as a characteristic feature of the imparfait, which is related to the catalysers (or secondary functions), the indexes and informants of Barthes. The doing-statements "jouait" ("would play"), "emportait" ("would take"), "serrait" ("would press"), "s'endormaient" ("would fall asleep") are placed in the permanence preceding the event-complication which triggers off the narrative, before the macro-proposition NP2-TF1. This is what the imparfait denotes, in the structure of manifestation. The openings of Baudelaire's prose poem and of the evangelical text seem more complex (this is why I have chosen them, of course). The first sentence in Baudelaire's text establishes an identity (old woman- child) as the basis of the act that occurs in the second paragraph, in the second macro-proposition. The utterance in the passe simple is a being-statement predicate which characterizes the subject as patient (subject of state of being) and as beneficiary. In fact, euphoria is possible only if the old woman remains detached from the others and it is her first movement of rapprochement-conjunction which brings about the catastrophe and leads to the inversion of the initial statement: the euphoria is an appearance. The</page><page sequence="23">Macro-Structure of Conventional Narrative 157 evangelical text is constructed on the basis of some kind of anterior narra- tive in the past perfect (plus-que-parfait) where the following appear: 1. the conjunction Herod-Herodias (NP1-ISt) 2. John's denunciation of this conjunction which is contrary to the Law (NP2-TF1) 3. the arrest and Herodias' hatred (NP3-evaluational TD); 4. Herod's knowledge and his protection of John (NP4-TF2); 5. Herod's perplexity (NP5-FSt- temporary). The narrative is thus aborted or rather engulfed, so to speak, by the use of the imparfait in the structure of manifestation (imparfait and plus-que- parfait play the same role). In fact, in deep structure, it is the equilibrium of narrative programs (Narrative Program 1 manifest in NP3 vs. Narrative Program 2 manifest in NP4) that opens the narrative. The four narratives establish a kind of basic proposition (macro- proposition NP1) which, in the structure of manifestation, is turned into a permanence by the imparfait, a permanence meant to be broken by the second macro-proposition. In the figure on p. 139, I wanted to stress the following: the macro-NP1 is inverted and constructed from macro-NP5 (whether this is done unconsciously or not does not matter: we are dealing here with the langue (as defined by Saussure) of the narrative, with the symbolic process of signification (see Adam 1979), according to Kristeva. I think, contrary to Labov, that the role of orientation (NP1) should not be limited to the opening of the narrative and considered as an isolated datum of the narrative kernel. The first macro-proposition lends itself most suit- ably to the investment of semantic categories, as related to NP5. In three out of four examples discussed above, the final correlative content takes up the initial content. On the level of manifestation, the passage from imparfait to passe simple is evident in the stories of Youkou- Lili and of John the Baptist; strangely enough, Baudelaire's prose poem inverts the system as if the initial correlative content constituted an incident: "rejoiced, = lexeme: seme/euphoria/ morpheme tense: /incidence/ in relation to the final stabilized content which unites dysphoria and permanence as the being of the old woman: "was crying" lexeme: /dysphorial morpheme tense: /permanence/ Isenberg's text illustrates better the idea of the coda of the narrative utterance, expressed by Labov: Coda may also contain general observations or show the effects of the events on the narrator (Labov 1972:365). In the stories of Youkou-Lili and of John the Baptist, enunciations of prag- matic doing conceal a cognitive doing; this is the cognitive dimension of the narrative scheme which is analyzed by Greimas in his preface to the book by Courtes</page><page sequence="24">158 JEAN-MICHEL ADAM In trying to explain the Proppian model, we have started from a central core, composed of a series of texts, and have interpreted it as the course followed by a subject, while considering it, because of the presence of confrontation of subjects, as the privileged place of the narrative scheme. This core, however, is far from constituting the entire narrative: on the contrary, it is enveloped, on a hierarchically superior level, by actantial structures, and narrative developments of a different nature [. . .] The analysis of narrative discourse is thus enriched with a new problematics, little explored as yet, and the narra- tive scheme reveals new components that one may seek to discern and interpret as new narrative courses followed not by subjects but by new actants designated as Semiotic Destinators (1976:23). It is necessary therefore to distinguish between the pragmatic dimension (course followed by a subject, doing of events) and the cognitive dimension of discourse (the latter "developing parallely with the increase of knowl- edge (cognitive activity) attributed to subjects installed in the discourse" (Greimas and Courths 1979). Thus we see that in each of the narratives studied above, certain cognitive positions can be found. The Old Woman's Despair ends with a reported discourse that has the characteristics of a "moral" or a "coda." This statement of a cognitive inter- pretative doing manifests the actorial syncretism of the pragmatic subject and the cognitive subject. The old woman interprets (cognitive subject) in NP5 her previous acts (pragmatic doing); in fact, the pragmatic dimension serves as pretext to the cognitive activity (answering the question: Whom am I?) to the acquisition of a knowledge: euphoria appearing dysphoria being The old woman herself is subject of the narrative itinerary and final desti- nator in the sense of "judge of the subject's performances whose 'doing' he transforms into a recognized 'being' " (Greimas and Courtes 1979:244). This logic seems to me to apply not only to this particular narrative or to a certain type of narrative (I remind you that I have deliberately chosen a children's story, an oral story, a literary text and an evangelical text, to diversify various types of narratives). Indeed, the same occurs in Isenberg's narrative and in Baudelaire's prose poem. In NP5, the narrator- subject of the pragmatic doing places himself, too, on the cognitive level. At the end of the final macro-proposition, he appears as Final destinator, conjoined at last with a knowledge from which he was implicitly and hereafter disjoined at the beginning of his narrative. The form the statement assumes is itself very clear: "Since that day [. . .]" a knowledge has modified the ulterior pragmatic doing of the subject-narrator in the form of an increase in knowledge-wisdom-caution (all being adult moral values inculcated by moral lessons and narratives, of course). This leads us back to Youkou-Lili and her new doll; here, the cognitive dimension remains totally implicit: the reader-listener must himself draw the "moral" of the story. While it was possible, in the two previous narra- tives, to speak of an increase of knowledge attributed to the subjects, it is no longer true in this case. To understand the cognitive dimension of this story, we must place ourselves on a different level, that of the economy of</page><page sequence="25">Macro-Structure of Conventional Narrative 159 narrative exchange. This narrative, like any other narrative, serves some- body (an individual or a social group). As Barthes has shown, nothing is ever told gratuitously: [...] one does not narrate to "amuse," to "instruct," or to satisfy a certain anthropological function of meaning; one narrates in order to obtain by exchanging [. . .] (1974:89). Like all social phenomena, the functioning of meaning in narrative dis- courses must be related to the ideological order and to the order of power. An intersection of different, multiple, heterogenous determinations, which turn it into a fundamentally "plural" object, the narrative is used mainly as a vehicle of values meant to produce certain effects on the listeners-readers-consumers. The story of Youkou-Lili is told to drive the child into the acceptance of the paternal-phallic values. In the evangelical narrative, the problem is slightly different because Herod's cognitive interpretative doing precedes the narrative. We saw that Herod was wrong when speaking of the resurrection of John the Baptist (appearing + non-being); his discourse seems "deceitful" (that which appears, but is not, in the square of "veridication"). The evangelical text provides at least two other interpretative courses: that of the apostles who are in on the "secret" (that which is without appearing) and that of the reader who draws a parallel between the doing of John the Baptist and that of Jesus. All this leads us to what I am tempted to call the argumentative basis of the narrative macro-propositions of the conventional narrative or the argumenta- tive basis of the narratives ordered by structurator CS.NMS. While apparently closing the narrative text (or the sequence) the macro-NP5 is a pragmatic connection which determines its construction, and its orientation from the point of view of production and of reading-consumption. The end of a narrative is "the way in which the narrative scheme is apprehended and actualized," Stierle (1972:181). The proposition which is called "coda" by van Dijk or Labov (and which is most obvious in Isenberg's text) implies perhaps too strongly the idea of the circularity of the narrative utterance, but helps mainly to envisage the narrative as an act of discourse, to examine the question of its place within linguistic narrative exchange. Before clarifying this point, I must reexamine the relations between narrative temporality and narrative causality. 3.2 Narrative, Temporality and Causality Barthes defines the problem in the following terms: From the scientific point of view, the logic which determines the actional sequence is very impure; it is only a semblance of logic that does not derive from the laws of formal reasoning but from our habitual way of reasoning and observing: it is an endoxal, cultural logic [. . .]; moreover this logic is con- fused with chronology: what comes after is perceived by us as caused by. Although temporality and causality are never pure in a narrative they seem to us to establish some kind of naturalness, of intelligibility, of legibility of the anecdote: they enable us, for example, to sum it up (what the ancients called argument, a term which is both logical and narrative) (1973:51-52).</page><page sequence="26">160 JEAN-MICHEL ADAM The basic narrative sequence consists therefore of the articulation of five macro-propositions whose median NPs ensure the transformation of one state into another. A kind of minimal or basic narrative, the complete sequence is composed of two distinct situations (ISt-NP1 and FSt-NP5); and each of them can be described by a small number of predicates (free propositions, in Labov). There must be a link of transformation between at least one predicate in each of the two situations. (Todorov 1971:239). The main function of the median NP is to act as transformational operator of the contents. When Danto (1968:236) defines the elementary structure of narrative by a three-term formula, he does not really contradict the quinary macro- structural hypothesis, since he groups, synthetically, the central macro- propositions (NP2 + NP3 + NP4) under one heading (H): 1. x is F at t1 2. H happens to x at t2 3. x is G at t3 That is: predicate F applies to subject x of the story (x guarantees the cohesion of the three functions') at the initial instant t1 and predicate G at the final instant t3. H effects the transformation F-G through a temporal succession t1 -t2 -t3; here too we are confronted with the same process which breaks (NP2) at state of equilibrium (NP1) to reach a new state opposed to the initial one (F vs. g) through a series of changes (NP3 and NP4).2 This role of narrative macro-propositions is clearly illustrated in the extreme example given by Bremond: In the cytoplasm, near the nucleus, the leading sphere is surrounded with threads and produces an aster; the leading sphere and the aster are divided in two and each sphere, surrounded by its aster sets itself at one of the cell poles, where they remain during the division (1973:111). 1. Considering the following statements: 1. X looks for Y+Z kidnaps W+Q finds K 2. X fights wit Y + X gains victory over Y + X is rewarded by W 3. X steals Y + Z looks for Y + W finds Y We can say that only (2) and (3) are recognized as being coherent. But if I take four actants X + Y + Z + W, and if, like Lessing, I write: Y devours X + Z devours Y + W devours Z, then I have a chain connection between one proposition and another, ensured by an actant: (A = aggressor agent, P = aggressed patient): Y(A) devours X(P) Z(A) devours Y(P) W(A) devours Z(P) The agent is thus transformed into a patient following a law, a principle that can be formu- lated thus: "the weakest is always the prey of the strongest." To become a fable, this princi- ple must be rewritten: "the marten devours the grouse, the fox devours the marten, the wolf devours the fox." But two additional transformations are needed to turn this statement into a fable: "Devours? Maybe not? This is not a strong enough assertion. I say therefore: devoured' (Lessing). To be a fable, the tale must end with the implication of the principle: "The weakest is always the prey of the strongest," i.e., an interpretation, an evaluation. 2. In this sense, Caesar's "Veni, vidi, vici" constitutes a minimal story that cannot be further reduced: "Between the instant tl of veni and instant t3 of vici, there is a vidi, marking the temporal succession t2, which produces such a striking effect precisely because, by a sort of witty bravado, it annihilates temporal succession altogether" (Stierle 1972:178).</page><page sequence="27">Macro-Structure of Conventional Narrative 161 Taken from an encyclopedia, this narrative by a bjologist of the first stage of cell division, is "narrative" insofar as it enumerates a series of events- transformations affecting a subject, which remains a constant during these transformations. The biologist plays the role of the narrator of a "story" dealing with an inanimate (non-human), not even anthropomorphic subject. This point would seem to challenge the exclusively anthropocen- tric definitions of narrative (Todorov 1969:28; Bremond 1966:62; Larivaille 1974:384; Labov 1977:1053). However, can we speak in this case of propo- sitions which are ordered in such a way to form a narrative? The coordina- tion between the various propositions seems to be entirely chronological. The difference between this scientific narrative and a conventional narra- tive (i.e., structured by CS.NMS) does not center on the definition of the propositions (predicate and arguments), but on the kind of order which is established between one proposition and another. In my opinion, this chronological, rather than narrative enunciation does not have an argu- mentative structure based on macro-propositions. This macro- organization is indispensable and originates in a demonstrative will which orders the series of events in relation to their end. A simple chronology of facts, in the form of a sequence of propositions linked by temporal junc- tions only, is a kind of degree zero of narrative (Bremond 1973:126), lying between description (defined mainly by spatiality and simultaneity) and narration (since simultaneity becomes succession). The relations between the various propositions are logical (implications linking a NP cause to a NP effect), temporal (succession of events in time and spatial).4 Taking up the list of causal relations proposed by Todorov in Grammaire de Dicameron (1969), modification, desire, motivation, result, punishment and hypothesis, Bremond "'tries' to order the relations according to the place they would occupy in a narrative sequence which would be ideally complete" (1973:119). It is not surprising that he arrives at this typical quinary narrative: A relation of motivation may introduce [NP1] a relation of desire [NP2] which itself may introduce a relation of hypothesis (intended to explicate the condi- tions under which the desire may be fulfilled) [NP3] there would follow then the transition to the act (in the form of one of the following verbs a [ = the aim of the action is to modify the situation], b [= to act reprehensibly, to sin, to transgress a law], c [ = to punish] [ = NP4]; there would finally come a relation of result, which would describe the consequence of the action [= NP5]. We would then have a unilinear sequence of functions, similar to that which, in Propp, defines the archetype of the Russian tale, but intended here to articu- late in its successive phases the cycle of the achievement of a task (1973:119-120). 3. "We define a narrative as one means of representing past experience by a sequence of ordered sentences that present the temporal sequence of those events by that order." 4. In fantastic tales, the sequence is in a way delimited by a change of place which coordi- nates it to the following sequence; the place may therefore be considered as a non- compulsory factor of junction and cohesion (the actor being compulsory).</page><page sequence="28">162 JEAN-MICHEL ADAM Bremond's works stress the alternative nature of the logical sequences of propositions. It is indeed evident that the first macro-proposition (NP1- orientation or as in the above quotation "motivation") is not only an attribu- tive proposition defining a state of the type "Cleopatra is beautiful," but a relation Cleopatra's beauty/seduction leading to the alternative: Anthony succumbs vs. Octavius is unmoved which constitutes the second macro- proposition (NP2-complication). The relation of desire is present in the case of Anthony (there is a NP2) vs. absent in the case of Octavius (no NP2). A new alternative appears then (in the case of Anthony who initiates the narrative): either, after NP3- evaluation or "hypothesis," the seduced patient becomes an agent by attempting to satisfy his desire (= NP4), or he renounces because "he feels it is forbidden, he fears possible complica- tions, he is conscious of not having the necessary means to succeed" (Bremond) and, in this case, there is no fourth macro-proposition (NP4- resolution or "passage to the act"). The issue of NP4 may lead to (= NP5) either (new alternative) a success or a failure. Note that both Todorov and Bremond recognize that "result" (NP5) and "motivation" (NP1) are comple- mentary. This brings me to examine narrative logic under a double perspective: 1. As it is suggested in Bremond's works, each macro-proposition "opens on an alternative: the future which it anticipates may either be realized or not. It is a structural law of narrative, on which depend the combined effects of expectation and surprise" (Bremond 1973:121). 2. The alternative nature of each macro-proposition accounts for the fact that the implication or the presupposition does not go from the verb cause of a NP: NP"' = "Y sins or commits a crime," to the verb effect of the follow- ing propositions: NP = "Z punishes Y." As Bremond very rightly says: "it would be more accurate to adopt the opposite point of view: it is the punishment which implies (or presupposes) the sin; if there has been no sin, the "punishment" usurps its name, it is in fact perseuction. As to the sin, although it is a necessary condition of punishment, it does not imply it, because it can just as well remain unpunished [. . .]. In the language of narration there is, on the paradigmatic axis, an alternative between two functions and the narrator's utterance selects the one which is suitable" (1973:122). 1. NP1 -NP2-NP3-NP5-NP5 2. NP5-[NP1-(NP2-NP3-NP4)] (1) is but the chronological effect of the succession of events. The structure of post hoc which becomes propter hoc is an ideological effect which enters into the definition of the play of CS.NMS which orders the conventional narrative. Having started this analysis with a quotation of Barthes, I shall end it with another one: Everything suggests, indeed, that the mainspring of narrative is precisely the confusion of consecution and consequence, what comes after being read as what is caused by; in which case narrative would be a systematic application of the logical fallacy denounced by Scholasticism in the formula post hoc, ergo propter hoc-a good motto for Destiny, of which narrative all things con- sidered is no more than the "language" (1977:94).</page><page sequence="29">Macro-Structure of Conventional Narrative 163 3.3 Macro-Proposition and Argumentative Orientation of Narrative Narrativity produces reality. It is "performative" in two ways: it makes one do and it makes one forget. On the one hand, it classifies social practice according to a hierarchical order, by valorizing some and devalorizing others. Thus, on the elemen- tary level, to tell, in the village pub, the story of grandpa Anatole's famous boozing, is to force one to drink and ignore whoever doesn't. From politics to commerce, narrative makes believe and therefore makes one do; it praises this and discredits that; it classifies. On the other hand, it produces oblivion; it establishes a silence about all things it doesn't speak of. And because it is always "full" and closed, it makes one even forget that it passes over certain things in silence. It is in this double sense that narrativity creates history. -Michel de Certeau (L'Arch No. 72, 1978:83) Many acts of discourse have an argumentative function insofar as, being illocutionary acts of argumentation, they aim at leading the listener- addressee to a certain conclusion or away from it. Although this function is certainly apparent on the level of manifestation, in the structure of the utterance, I think it is necessary to situate the argumentative component of narrative discourse on the level of the sequence or of the text, rather than on the level of sentences. In other words, the basic narrative utter- ance, in its structural order, an argumentative characterization: that of the macro-propositions which turn it into a coherent text. The characterization may vary according to the different situation; however, the orientation, the argumentative use of the utterance are in a way foreseen in its macro- structural order; they constitute a "condition of possiblity of (narrative) dis- course" (Foucault). Generally speaking, we may define as argumentative any finalized dis- course, while adding, as Vignaux does, two conditions or characteristics: Condition 1: to be argumentative, a discourse must be structured in propositions or theses which constitute an argument and render, either directly or indirectly, a or the position of the orator; given the locutor- author's defined place within a social formation, a discourse is argumenta- tive when it exposes a point of view, a position of this locutor-author on a certain subject or on several subjects; this position indicating directly, indirectly, or even disguising the place of the locutor-author in the social formation in question. Condition 2: A discourse is argumentative when it is oriented towards another person (individualized or not, actualized or not in the utterance). This second condition determines the propositions of the discourse. It is the other to whom are directed the assertions or judgements which the utterer organizes into a system: "The argumentative discourse seeks if not always to convince, at least to establish the rightness of an attitude, an argument, a conclusion" (Vignaux 1973:126-127).</page><page sequence="30">164 JEAN-MICHEL ADAM This accepted, it seems evident that the macro-organization of narrative discourse corresponds to an argumentative foundation. Narrative func- tions as a trap, mobilizing rhetorical, tactical, dialogical processes and argumentative operations. Wanting to take a narrative in a situation more exemplary perhaps than those I have quoted so far, I hesitated between the narrative with which President Giscard d'Estaing5 ended his speech on "the right choice for France" (27 January 1978) and an extract from The Just by Albert Camus which I have already dealt with (but from a different angle) (1979:114-115). I shall limit myself here to the latter example, for reasons of length, and shall situate the analysis within the perspective of Labov's works on the familiar narrative. As Labov points out: Some narratives [.. ..] contain only narrative clauses; they are complete in the sense that they have a beginning, a middle and an end. But there are other elements of narrative structure found in more fully developed types. Briefly, a fully-formed narrative may show the following: 1. Abstract. 2. Orientation. 3. Complicating action. 4. Evaluation. 5. Result or resolution. 6. Coda. (Labov 1972:363). Let us consider the following extract from The Just (act 4): KALIAYEV: No, you're wrong there brother. God can't do anything to help; justice is our concern (A short silence) Don't you understand? Do you know that old tale about Saint Dmitri? FoKA: No KALIAYEV: He had made a date with God, far out in the steppes. When he was on his way to keep the appointment, he came on a peasant whose cart was stuck in the mud. And Saint Dmitri stopped to help him. The mud was thick and the wheels were so deeply sunk that it took him the best part of an hour to pull the cart out. When this was done, Dmitri made haste to the appointed place. But he was too late. God had left. FOKA: And then? KALIAYEV: Then-there are some who always arrive too late, because there are too many bogged carts on the way, too many brothers to help out. (Foka is fidgeting uneasily). What's the matter? THE GUARD: Not so loud. And you, my man, don't dawdle! FoKA: I don't feel easy! It ain't natural, all this stuff you're telling me about saints and carts and whatnot. Sounds to me crazy, getting oneself put in prison for ideas like that. And then, there's something else . (Camus 1972). The dialogism at the basis of the argumentative process passes not only througL the dialogue itself, conducted between the two characters (through the conversation and its structure) but also through and in the ordering of macro-propositions-arguments. In an undeveloped and yet essential remark to be found in "The Transformation of Experience in Nar- 5. See Adam, J.-M. in Pratiques, No. 30, 1981.</page><page sequence="31">Macro-Structure of Conventional Narrative 165 rative Syntax" (last chapter of Language in the Inner city, 1972:370), Labov brings to light the dialogical basis inherent to narrative process, by sug- gesting that it answers underlying questions: the abstract answers the question "what was this about?", the orientation "who, when, what, where?, " the complicaton "then what happened?," the evaluation "so what?," the result "what finally happened." He adds: The coda is not given in answer to any of these five questions, and it is accordingly found less frequently than any other element of the narrative. The coda puts off a question - it signals that questions c and d are no longer relevant (Labov 1972:370). This is indeed what happens in the conversation imagined by Camus. The question "Do you know the legend of Saint Dmitri?" stands for the abstract by means of a proposition where "the legend" answers the implicit ques- tion: "what was this about (or what is it going to be about)?" the proposition orientation corresponds to the series of imparfaits and the passe simple (which triggers the development) of the first sentence of the narrative. The complication covers the three following sentences and the connector "then" answers the presupposed question. As to the result (sentences 5 and 6), it is explicitly introduced by "when this was done," a perfect answer to the implicit "what finally happened?" the coda is carried out by the rest of the dialogue and particularly by Foka's last words; finally evaluation is intro- duced by the question "So what?' asked by Foka and about which Labov writes: There are so many ways to tell the same story, to make very different points, or to make no point at all. Pointless stories are met (in English) with the withering rejoinder, "so what?' Every good narrator is continually warding off this question; when his narrative is over, it should be unthinkable for a bystander to say, "So what?' Instead, the appropriate remark would be, "he did?' or some similar means of registering the reportable character of the events of the narrative (Labov 1972:366). In Therapeutic Discourse, Labov speaks of the place of the narrative within discursive exchange in the following way: "It is given as an instance of a general proposition. It is not required that the listener agree to the propo- sition, or even that he disagree. He must, however, indicate to the narrator that he has understood how this narrative is to be interpreted, that it is intended as evidence for a specific proposition" (1977:109) This is true in the example from Camus which is presented and received (without being understood) as an argument in the discussion. The legend of Saint Dmitri seems to conform to the two principles of Aristotle for whom narrative must both surprise the listener or reader and be probably (pard ten d6xan and kat&amp; tb eikas); it also conforms to Labov's idea according to which the narrated event must be perceived as different from daily experience to sustain and justify the listener's attention: "We would intuitively reject such introductions as Let me tell you something that happened yesterday [. . .] A narrative that is in fact judged to be ordinary may be rejected after it is told by expressions equivalent to So what?' (1977:105). In fact, conventional narrative seems to me to be a form derived from the narrative exemplum, from the fable or from the parable (even from the</page><page sequence="32">166 JEAN-MICHEL ADAM roman &amp; these). In these specific forms, as Suleiman has shown, the reader reestablishes spontaneously (phenomenon of narrative competence) the interpretation or the injunction which may not be manifested. When read- ing a parable, the reader recognizes that he is told a story which means something other than what it actually says and he immediately links it to a contextual or intertextual doctrinal body. Like narratives deriving from the exemplum, conventional narrative aims at demonstrating, persuading: it is ordered by its end, its "moral." Through its aim, narrative is exchanged for a submission to an (its) order of values, and, beyond that, to a power which seeks to persuade, manipulate, reduce to silence, make believe. Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to think that the theory of narration amounts to a communicational theory of linguistic performance. The narrative's function of exchange is described in the following terms by Barthes: [. . .] narrative as object is the point of a communication: there is a donor of the narrative and a receiver of the narrative. In linguistic communication, je and tu (I and you) are absolutely presupposed by one another; similarly, there can be no narrative without a narrator and listener (or reader) (Barthes 1977:109). [. . .] the role of the sender has been abundantly enlarged upon [.. .] when it comes to the reader, however, literary theory is much more modest. In fact, the problem is not to introspect the motives of the narrator or the effects the narrator produces on the reader, it is to describe the code by which narrator and reader are signified throughout the narrative itself (Barthes 1977:109-10). It is necessary to break away from the fictional communicative situation (donor beneficiary) in which every reader-listener of narrative discourse places himself spontaneously, because it is not an author who produces fictional reality in the reader's mind, but a discourse, an organization: the story. Kuroda is right, I think, when he speaks of the objective function of "the sentence set down on the printed page," that is, of manifestation (1975:286). It is necessary to regard in this context the notion of intertextuality as an (inter)textual dialogue of discourse inside the (in this case, narrative) utter- ance; but also as a notion which applies to the linguistic dimensions of the dialogism of all speech acts inscribed in a specific social horizon. After Bakhtin, Voloshinov and J. Kristeva, one may say that not only the novel, but narrative in general "exteriorize linguistic dialogism" (Kristeva 1970:87). In this perspective, the structure of narrative (centering upon the couple author-narrator / characters, subject of the utterance (enunciation) subject of the proposition (enunciate) results from the dialogism inherent in language, that is, the ambivalence of the subjective and of the communica- tive, the permutation, the crossing, the neutralization of the proposition (enunciate) in the seemingly monologic discourse the inscription of the story (histoire) in the narrative (ricit) and of the narrative (ricit) in the story (histoire). A double dialogism must therefore be envisaged: on the one hand, that of the narrative (literary or not) with the anterior corpus, the cultural background spoken by (speaking) the narrator, and on the other</page><page sequence="33">Macro-Structure of Conventional Narrative 167 hand, the dialogism of the dialogue inherent in any act of production and reception of narrative discourse.6 The meaning is not in the author's mind, nor in the reader's, but in the effect produced by the interaction of the dis- courses of these two socially organized subjects. The narrative is written- told to be read-listened to by the other and it carries this reality in its (macro-) structure itself. Meaning resides in this link production - counter- utterance (contre parole) of reading and is actualized in a process of active comprehension which implies a response. To sum up, I shall define the macro-organization of narrative discourse as a form of structuration of discourse, a condition of possibility of its pro- duction, determined intertextually, and as an organization of linguistic dialogism. While on the more superficial level, we are faced with a prob- lematics of the speech-act (historical utterance/utterance of discourse and reported discourses), on the level of the macro-structure itself, it is the orientation of the macro-propositions, their place in relation to the final proposition, inscribing the persuasive-argumentative foundation (orienta- tion of discourse towards the other), which predominates. 6.
