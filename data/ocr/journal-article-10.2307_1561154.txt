<plain_text><page sequence="1">FROM GRACE TO SIN: NAMES AND ABSTRACTIONS IN PAUL'S LETTERS by M. WINGER New York Abstract nouns-"love," for example, or "faith"-present an interesting problem in understanding language, in the New Testament as else- where. Typically, abstract nouns are closely related to other ways of expressing the same (or a similar) meaning, usually with a verb or an adjective cognate to the abstract noun: for example, "love" is related to "loving," or "to love," "faith" to "faithful," or "to believe" or "to trust." But is the meaning the same, or only similar? Does using an abstract noun say, or imply, something which is not said, or implied, by using the cognate verb? Is a noun a name for some kind of thing, while a verb is not? And if it is, what kind of thing is that? Described in this way, abstract nouns present a general problem, but not necessarily one with a general solution. What is true of "faith" might not be true of "love," or of "sin," and moreover, one person's conception or use of any of these terms might differ from another's. I intend here to focus on one writer-Paul-and on several such terms, including those just mentioned. First, some preliminary examples will illustrate the issues. Thus, we speak of "faith"-"I have faith," or "he has lost his faith"- but often the noun can easily be replaced by a verb. Instead of "I have faith that she will return," I can say, "I believe that she will return" (or, if that is too weak, "I firmly believe...").1 If there is a difference between these sentences, it is subtle. We would not say, "I have faith that she will return, but I don't firmly believe that she will," or "I firmly believe she will return, but I have no faith that she will." ' In this case adjusting the noun and the verb so that their meanings correspond is complicated in English, where the two are not cognate; in Greek, in contrast, the noun is tiaot; and the verb stoae'co. But we should be able to handle the adjustment, choos- ing as necessary among "believe," "firmly believe," "trust," "am confident," or similar expressions. It is certainly not the case that verbs are generally either stronger or weaker than nouns; whatever the difference, it is something other than this. ?

WINGER Evidently, then, one of these two statements is true if and only if the other one is: they are semantcally equivalent. Similarly, for "I have faith in him" we might substitute "I trust him," or perhaps, more elab- orately, "I believe that he will do what is right"; the particular con- text would guide us. So it seems that the expressions "faith that" and "faith in" may be translated into expressions in which the noun "faith" is replaced by the verb "to believe," or "to trust."2 Does it follow that faith, at least, is an abstract noun which says nothing that is not said by its cognate verb? Not necessarily. As always in understanding language, meaning is not a function of particular words by themselves, but of the statements in which the words are used.3 Analyzing statements of the kind "I have faith in " and "I have faith that " does not necessarily tell us what "faith" will mean in a different kind of statement; moreover, even in these sentences "faith" could have one sense with 'John" in the blank, and a different sense with "God." One must proceed cautiously. Further, an equivalence between expressions with nouns and ones with verbs cuts both ways: if we could replace the noun with the verb, could we not equally replace the verb with the noun? Why then should one have priority? And if the noun and verb forms can be used in exactly equivalent ways, why do both forms exist? We have merely scratched the surface here; the meaning of faith is a very large topic, and even when we put quotation marks about "faith" to indicate that we only want to define the term, not to explicate every theological issue related to it, this line between the meaning of the term and the meaning of statements in which the term is used is (as we have just indicated) indistinct at the very best. In fact one major 2 It is an interesting feature of English that, besides "faith," we have the separate noun "belief," which can often be used in nearly the same ways ("it's my belief she'll return," "I have faith she'll return"); moreover, to have faith generally implies having a belief, and in that case the faith and the belief might be said to have the same con- tent (that she will return). Nevertheless "belief" differs from "faith" on just the point we are discussing. We may think of faith as an attribute or quality of a person, but not so with belief. I think it likely that this difference reflects the special sense which "faith" has acquired in Christian theology, and may thus be traced back to Paul, and to Paul's use of itlrt;. Whether it accurately reflects that usage is another question. 3 A classic expression of this doctrine is Gottlob Frege's injunction "never to ask for the meaning of a word in isolation, but only in the context of a proposition" (The Foundations of Arithmetic, trans. J.L. Austin; revised ed. [Oxford: Blackwell, 1980] x; orig- inally published as Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik [Breslau, 1884]). See also W.V. Quine, Theories and Things (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1981) 3, tracing "the view of sentences as primary in semantics, and of names or other words as dependent on sentences for their meaning," to Bentham. 146</page><page sequence="3">NAMES AND ABSTRACTIONS IN PAUL'S LE'I'I'EKS theological treatment of faith shows us how it may matter whether "faith" is a noun or a verb. For Thomas Aquinas, faith is a virtue, and virtues are habits or dispositions.4 How could this be expressed without using the noun? We might speak of "believing habitually," but can we understand "habitually" without referring to a habit? And it is just this habit which, for Aquinas, constitutes "faith"; so what we forced out the front door has had to be re-admitted through the back. For Aquinas, the abstract noun "faith" (fides) does name something which the verbs "trust" and "believe" do not naturally refer to. This is equally true of the abstract nouns "hope" (spes) and "love" (caritas), which Aquinas treats in the same way as "faith"; for Aquinas, all three are virtues, and hence habits, and dispositions.5 At the same time, however, it does not follow that because one uses a noun rather than a verb one necessarily invokes something-like a habit-which suits a noun and not a verb. Not everyone is a Thomist. The choice between noun and verb might be arbitrary sometimes, or even usually; so far we have only said that it need not be. Other terms raise other issues. Paul's use of "love," especially in 1 Cor. 13, is sometimes taken to suggest some thing different from a habit. Thus Ceslaus Spicq has written: Agape [love] is a spiritual entity... a power (dynamis) of divine origin and a par- ticipation in the forces of the world to come.... Moreover, it is autonomous- so active, spontaneous, personal and powerful that one hesitates to call it a thing.6 Spicq adds that, based on 1 Cor. 13, "Peter Lombard was not so far from the truth when he identified charity with the Holy Spirit itself," a suggestion apparently endorsed by Victor Paul Furnish (a believer's life is "empowered by the Holy Spirit, poured into his heart as love") and Hans Dieter Betz ("when the Christian receives the Spirit of the Son of God ([Gal.] 4:6) he also receives the divine power of love").7 But if love is a power, then the term has evidently lost the abstract quality which we began by assuming, and become concrete-although just what sort of concrete entity it is, and what relation this entity 4Summa Theologiae I-II, Q: 62, Art. 3; Q. 55, Art. 1; Q. 49, Art. 3. 5 One of Aquinas's principal texts is 1 Cor. 13:13, "Now there remain faith, hope, love, these three...."

WINGER bears to "love" as that term is otherwise used, are open questions to which we shall have to return. Sin presents a similar issue. According to Rom. 5:21 and 6:12, 14, sin "rules" (PaotBXeV, lKCplewo), or at least it did before Christ came. Many have taken this to mean that "sin" in these passages identifies a cosmic power: a concrete entity, like "love" on the interpretation we have just noted.8 "Sin" seems to offer at least three distinct possibilities: it might be used (1) of some specific action (not to identify the act but to characterize it-as in "stealing is a sin," equivalent to "stealing is sinful");9 or (2) of a general state, defined perhaps as separation from God;'1 or (3) of a concrete force or power." In the first of these cases the use of a noun could be regarded as incidental; like an adjective, "sin" in this sense refers not to some particular thing, but rather to a quality common to many particular things. In both the second and third cases there is something particular called "sin," but its nature differs; while we might class a state (like a habit) as abstract, a cosmic power seems concrete. Basic Considerations I propose to show that the common features of abstract nouns pro- vide useful avenues to the interpretation of passages containing such words. The first step is a more detailed account of abstractions, and here there are various paths we could take, some of them ancient and arduous. We could call our abstract terms "universals," and join the debate, especially prominent in medieval times, over whether (and in what sense) universals exist.'2 This recondite subject I will leave to one 8 See Ernst Kisemann, "On Paul's Anthropology," in Perspectives on Paul, (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1971) 1-31, 27; Martinus C. de Boer, The Defeat of Death (Sheffield: JSOT Press, 1988) 160-169. 9 2 Cor. 11:7: "Did I commit a sin in abasing myself?" = "Was it sinful to abase myself?" (In ancient Greek LSJ records the apparently adjectival form aulXap'lgwov only once. Lampe cites uses of &amp;laprapuco in the fourth century C.E.) '0 Perhaps Rom. 6:1, "Shall we continue in sin...?" " Perhaps Rom. 6:12, "Let not sin therefore reign...." 12 A rough measure of one's taste for philosophy might be found in whether one sees any interest (or even any sense) in this dispute. The reader may try this test by examining Marilyn McCord Adams, "Universals in the early fourteenth century," ch. 20 of N. Kretzmann et al., eds., The Cambridge History of Later Medieval Philosophy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1982) 411-39. For a modem comment see P.F. Strawson, "Universals," in Entity and Identit (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997) 52-63, main- taining (p. 59; emphasis in the original) that "universals, if they exist at all, do not exist in nature [but] are incorrigiby abstract; objects, if objects at all, of thought alone...." 148</page><page sequence="5">NAMES AND ABSTRACTIONS IN PAUL'S LETTERS side; however, the distinction between universal and particular terms suggests several helpful points. In a useful modem form this distinction is tri-partite; there are (1) particulars, consisting of "proper names, as well as pronouns and phrases which identify a definite person or thing"; (2) sortal universals, typically common nouns, "which serve to group indi- viduals into classes"; and (3) characterizing universals, typically abstract nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs, "which refer to qualities, states, actions, etc."13 One implication of this scheme is that grammatical func- tion is not the issue-especially for characterizing universals, which might be identified by any of four parts of speech. This matches the way we saw that "faith," "faithful" and "to trust" can express more-or-less the same thoughts; that is, the noun "faith" may be used to identify a char- acteristic of someone (being faithful, or trusting, or acting faithfully). A second implication is that the same word can fall into different classifications, according to its use. When "love" or "sin" refers to some particular force or power, then it is a particular, even though in another place it is a universal. Likewise, in specific statements nouns and other universals will be found within "phrases which identify a definite person or thing." The importance of attending precisely to specific usage also emerges in another distinction, that between object and concept, for the same term can on one occasion be used to designate an object and on another as part of a concept.'4 This distinction may be illustrated with concrete objects; an object is some particular thing, while a concept is anything one can assert about an object. The model is a simple declar- ative sentence of the form "a is X," where a, the grammatical subject, names an object, and the predicate " is X" marks a concept. Thus, "Man O' War is a horse": we might have supposed that "a horse" is an object, but the point of this analysis is that "a horse" identifies no particular object, but rather a kind of object-and here the words "kind of" indicate that we are talking about a concept. Thus, the concept in this sentence is the incomplete expression " is a horse," which means " is warm-blooded, giving birth to live young, hoofed," etc.-in other words, the concept is that of having (Strawson's position seems substantially the same as that of John Duns Scotus as Adams describes it in her essay, p. 413). 13 John Lyons, Introduction to Theoretical Linguistics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1968) 337-38. Note that some abstract nouns are sortals: for example, idea, num- ber, and, to recur to Aquinas's discussion of virtues, habit. 14 See G. Frege, "On Concept and Object," in Collected Papers on Mathematics, Logic and Philosophy (Oxford: Blackwell, 1984) 182-94. 149</page><page sequence="6">M. WINGER the characteristics which define "horse" and distinguish horses from other things.'5 According to this analysis, "love" represents an object in "Love is a many-splendored thing" (or at least it might), but in "I do it all for love," "love" is part of the concept " does for love," which we could paraphrase, " does because he loves [someone] [something]."16 Again, it is a matter of how the term is used. A useful way of putting this is to ask what the term identifies-or, to use a term of art frequently employed, to what does the term refer? The second formulation makes use of a distinction between a term's reference, which is what it points to, and its sense, which describes the way in which the term refers. The point of this distinction is that terms with different senses can have the same reference; this distinction was defined by Frege, who also supplied the classic illustration: both "the Morning Star" and "the Evening Star" refer to the identical physical object Venus, but by means of different senses (something like "the bright star seen near the sun in the morning/evening").17 An example from Paul is the use of both ypacpi and vo6og to refer to the words of scripture (compare Gal. 3:8 with 4:21). Like most referring expressions, "the Morning Star" is a phrase; individual terms, such as "star," do not usually refer (unless, in a par- ticular context such as Paul's letter to the Galatians, they abbreviate some identifying phrase). Context is generally critical; as we have already noted, meaning is a function of statements rather than individual words. In the sentence "I have faith in John," the word "faith" by itself does not refer to anything, but as part of the referring expression "faith in John" it refers to a belief that John is, or will do, something indicated in the broader context. To say that the same belief might have been conveyed by a different expression is nothing surprising-there are '5 Besides a one-place predicate like" is a horse" there are two-place rela- tions like " hit " and " is taller than ," as well as more com- plicated forms. All of these are concepts. Strictly speaking, grammatical subjects should not be identified with objects; if they were, "horses" would become an object in "Horses are mammals," but the meaning of this sentence is rather, "Whatever is a horse is a mammal"; the concept "horse" is put under the concept "mammal." No object has been identified. See Frege, "On Concept and Object," 187. Once again, grammar is not controlling. 16 "Love" would also represent an object in "Love makes me do all I do" (concept: "__ makes do _ "), which resembles "I do it all for love," but does not necessarily mean the same thing. 17 G. Frege, "On Sense and Meaning," in Collected Papers, 157-77. (In this translation "meaning" is used for what I, following most writers in English, have called "reference.") 150</page><page sequence="7">NAMES AND ABSTRACTIONS IN PAUL'S LE'i-I'ERS alternative ways of saying anything we might wish to say. (I am defer- ring discussion of what the differences between the alternatives may mean until we get to specific cases.) Several other points will assist us when we examine the texts. One is the fact that some terms have contraries while others do not; for "faithful" there is the contrary "faithless," but there is no "not-Paul" contrary to Paul.'8 Let us say that terms of the first kind refer to qual- ities and those of the second to substances, without trying to resolve whether qualities are the same as universals or concepts, and substances the same as particulars or objects; but whatever the vocabulary, this is another distinction which will be useful in analyzing what our terms are used to refer to. (Henceforth I will use "quality" in this technical sense of something which admits a contrary.) Next, some terms incorporate a criterion of identity which is essen- tial to the term's use. For example, I do not understand what "Hudson River" means unless I realize that this expression does not refer only to the stretch of water between Manhattan and New Jersey; I must also know (at least in principle-my grasp of actual geography might be weak) how to determine whether some other stretch of water is also the Hudson River. If I know these things I know the criterion of iden- tity for the Hudson-a criterion which, moreover, is not peculiar to the Hudson, but applies to any river. This is typical for criteria of identity; they apply to classes of things. Recalling a term we used ear- lier, criteria of identity apply to sortal universals.19 Criteria of identity exist for abstractions as well as physical objects like rivers; for instance, our ability to identify "blue" wherever we encounter the term depends on our understanding that it refers to a color, not to a shape, or size, or texture, or some other aspect of the various concrete objects which are blue. On the other hand, there is no criterion of identity for qualitative terms like "tall" or "heavy," which may apply to physical objects of otherwise entirely diverse kinds.20 18 The idea is scarcely coherent, but, since "faithless" is true of whatever "faithful" is false of, "not-Paul" should lack whatever qualities Paul has. 19 On criteria of identity, see generally M. Dummett, Frege: Philosophy of Language (2d ed.; Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1981) 73-80. 20 Although the presence or absence of a criterion of identity has (like other points I have touched on) been invoked to establish or deny that certain words refer to things, this, as I have already said, is not the kind of conclusion I want to draw. Whether or not a term is associated with a criterion of identity is rather a distinction which (like the other points I have touched on) will help to clarify what Paul refers to, on the var- ious and specific occasions when he employs the abstract terms we are investigating. 151</page><page sequence="8">152 M. WINGER One final general observation is important: meaning exists at differ- ent levels. If I say, "Love whopped me over the head," I am certainly presenting love as a concrete object; but how seriously should this be taken? There is some metaphor here, although which elements are metaphorical ("whopped," "over the head," "love") is unclear. As usual, we would need context to sort this out, and in context we might find other rhetorical figures besides metaphor. I might mean that I fell in love (itself a metaphor); I might mean that love (my love for some par- ticular person? my tendency to infatuation?) turned out badly for me. I might be speaking ironically. These possibilities will sometimes need to be considered in examin- ing particular texts. Paul I have already referred to several abstract nouns appearing in Paul's letters: nICTit, a&amp;yantr, &amp;aapxia. There are a number of others, especially those listed in Table I. With each of these nouns I give the cognate verbs, adjectives and adverbs also found in Paul's letters. The number of times each word appears in the Nestle-Aland26 text of the seven undisputed letters is given in parentheses. Other nouns could be added to this table, including the various fruits of flesh and spirit listed in Gal. 5:19-23, but the table already gives more than I will cover here.

But what is "grace"? Our question is more linguistic than theological; as with other abstract nouns, we would like to know if "grace" refers to some one thing, or is perhaps an attribute, being gra- cious, or is a way of describing various things which are done gra- ciously. The cognate verb is Xapi{otal, which Paul uses eleven times; usually this is defined as "give freely" or "give graciously or cheerfully."21 Nearly half of the time Paul uses Xapt; in the nominative case which, according to the distinction we have noted between object and concept, implies that XaptS is an object. But on examination these nominatives suggest something else. They break down into (1) five cases of Xaipt; "of God," with six more that apparently refer to the xapt; of God;22 (2) six cases of (with slight variations) XaptS "of our lord Jesus Christ" (all with the appended phrase "[be] with you");23 (3) seven cases of Xiapt "from God our father and the lord Jesus Christ" (all with "to you");24 and (4) six cases of XaptS "to God."25 Working through these groups in reverse order, Xapt; "to God" is an idiom meaning "thanks to God," equivalent to the adjectival "I am thankful," or "let us be thankful," in each case for something God has done. This has the con- trary "I am/let us not (be) thankful," indicating that Paul is speaking of a quality. There is no criterion of identity here; the question, "Are the thanks you gave God today the same as the ones you gave yes- terday?" would reflect a misunderstanding. In this case Xapt; charac- terizes an attitude-to God, as it happens, although that depends on the appended dative T4 0eo. Xapt; "to you from God" (and so forth) is also an idiom with the dative, part of Paul's standard salutation.26 The sense is "may God our father and the lord Jesus Christ be favorable to you"; here too there is a contrary ("unfavorable"), and, since the immediate contexts do not 21 Respectively, BAGD s.v. 1; LSJ s.v.

(In 1 Thess. 1:1 the "from" phrase, omitted from many early manuscripts, was probably added by scribes to match Paul's other letters.) 25 Rom. 6:17; 7:25; 1 Cor. 15:57; 2 Cor. 2:14; 8:16; 9:15. 26 It also appears in the Deutero-Pauline letters, Eph. 1:2; Col. 1:2; 2 Thess. 1:2. The Pastorals have nearly the same form. 153</page><page sequence="10">M. WINGER refer to any particular way in which this favor might be manifested, there is apparently no criterion of identity for this Xapt;.27 Similarly, Xapt; "of our lord Jesus Christ be with you" is part of a standard clos- ing, with no apparent distinction in meaning from the salutation. The suspicion that Xapt; in these general formulae does not refer to any particular thing is confirmed by our first class, Xapt; "of God," as well as by a number of passages with xapt; in an oblique case, for these expressions are applied to a variety of different things: in Rom. 5:15, 20 and 21, to the gift (&amp;opea, 6&amp;opila) of Christ's obedience; in 1 Cor. 15:10, to that by which Paul is an apostle; in Rom. 1:5, to the success of Paul's mission. In other passages where the xaptl is not said to be of God orJesus, the term is used for the collection forJerusalem (1 Cor. 16:3; 2 Cor. 8:1, 4, 6) and for a visit from Paul (2 Cor. 1:15). Even a standard phrase, XaptS "given to me [us]," varies in its refer- ence: to Paul's authority in Rom. 12:3; to the various gifts of prophecy, service, teaching, exhortation, generosity, zeal and cheerfulness in Rom. 12:6-8; to Paul's ministry in Rom. 15:15; to the Corinthians' enrichment "in all discourse and knowledge" in 1 Cor. 1:4; to Paul's founding of the Corinthian mission in 1 Cor. 3:10; and to his Gentile mission in Gal. 2:9. Together these passages suggest that XaptS itself is a general term for gift, encompassing various specific gifts identified in context.28 In principle, anything could be a gift. This adjectival sense of Xaptg is especially clear in Rom. 4:4 and 16, in the opposition between Kaxa Xaptv and Kaca o6cpeikrla, "as a gift" and "as an obligation"; 6ocpeikla expresses the contrary to xapt;. The same idea in a different vocabu- lary underlies Gal. 2:21, "I do not nullify the gift (xaptS) of God; for if justification came through law, then Christ died for nothing"; here the contrast is between justification by Christ's gift of himself (2:20) and justification by law, probably meaning God's gift of the law; for Paul's denial that he nullifies God's XyaptS suggests that those whom he opposed in Galatia used xapt; to refer to the law. If so, then we have another referent here for Xadpt;. But perhaps a few passages suggest something else-for instance in Romans 5 and 6, where we hear that Xaptg "reigns through righteous- 27 Unless, that is, the expression is a term of art with a reference which need not be specified. These passages, however, do not suggest such a reference. 28 Note that Paul uses the xadpt; T( 0e( formula (see n. 25) in connection with gifts of God; it is for such gifts that Paul and his readers are grateful. Nevertheless, the dative in this phrase seems to rule out the use of Xapt; to refer directly to God's actions. 154</page><page sequence="11">NAMES AND ABSTRACTIONS IN PAUL'S LETTERS ness resulting in eternal life through Jesus Christ our lord" (5:21), and that "you are not under law but under Xapt;" (6:14, 15). In these passages Xapt; not only becomes suddenly a concrete object, but, as Fitzmyer observes, it is personified.29 To say this, however, does not answer but frame our question: if X&amp;ptS here refers to an object or a person, what object or person is that? If we work back from 5:21 to see what Xaptg is meant-or better, if we begin at 5:1 or 4:1 and work forward-the impression of concreteness fades. In 4:4 and 16, as we have just noted, the adverbial phrase icata Xaptv means "as a gift"; the noun is part of an adverbial expression describing a quality, which might in principle be ascribed to anything, and in Romans 4 it is attributed to inheriting the world, according to the promise made to Abraham: the world is a XadptS, a gift.30 In 5:2, "this xapt; in which we stand," the noun is used to refer to this state of inheriting the world, but the use is figurative, a kind of metonymy-as we might use "gift" to refer to something given, but still meaning the specific thing in question, and not some general state or quality of Giftness or Gifthood. Then in 5:15-19 Xapt; (with three other terms meaning "gift," aptoaga, 8copea and &amp;8c6prla) is connected to the "righteous act" and "obedience" of Christ. In 5:21, then, the attribution of ruling power to xapt; can be taken for a reference to Christ, while the term itself, invoking the thought of chapter 4, suggests the state in which humans stand thanks to Christ; the ambiguity is inherent in the figurative speech, and precludes a literal reading. Finally, "under Xapt;" in 6:14 and 15 continues the image of ruling x%pt; from 5:21.31 Thus here, as else- where, x%ptS marks a quality shared by many things, and not, itself, a thing. With this understanding we may contrast Bultmann's declaration that in Rom. 5:20-21 "the meaning of 'grace' approaches actual iden- tity with that of 'spirit'..."32 Probably this would be better expressed (using our terminology) by saying that Paul uses xapt; to refer to the spirit; but even with this modification, the statement confuses what 29 J. A. Fitzmyer, Romans (AB; New York: Doubleday, 1993) 422, 447. 30 Or perhaps this is too imprecise. According to C.K. Barrett (A Commentagy on the Epistle to the Romans [New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1957] 95; emphasis in the original) Kaxra&amp; apiv refers to "God's plan," which "was made to rest upon faith on man's side in order that on God's it might be a matter of grace."

It may be that the spirit rules in the fashion Paul ascribes to Xapt;, and equally that the spirit could be spoken of as a gift, using either Xaipti or some other term; but this is not what Paul says in Rom. 5:20-21. Another contrast is with Conzelmann's interpretation of Xa'ptS in the Theological Dictiona?y of the New Testament.33 Noting that X(apt may refer to different things, Conzelmann identifies the principal referent in Paul as "salvation," usually as an "event," but sometimes as a "state."34 I have no quarrel with this approach, provided it is understood that while Xapt1 refers to something, this something is not identical to X~apt itself; that salvation is a gift does not make these two terms inter- changeable. But in another paragraph Conzelmann speaks of "the power of grace," and refers eleven times to grace as "it," without speak- ing of "salvation" at all.35 According to the analysis of Xapt; as refer- ring to salvation we should be able to replace each "it" with "salvation," yielding (for example), "Salvation is not just superior to sin and its result, death," and "Salvation makes generosity possible."36 Thus restated, both sentences seem to have the same truth value as they would with "grace," but the first has become so banal that I doubt Conzelmann actually had it in mind when he wrote what he wrote. At the least, his paragraph on "the power of grace" runs the risk of creating a dis- tinct entity out of something better understood-on Conzelmann's analysis as well as ours-in a different way. The argument here also offers a useful modification to Hendrikus Boers' recent analysis of Xaptg.37 Boers argues that in Galatians and Romans Xdapti has "a certain technical status" originated by Paul- that is, as "the defining characteristic of ;nioat;" and as "the power under which the believer lives"; at the same time Boers acknowledges that "xapt; did not become a technical term in a systematic sense," leaving one in some doubt as to what the "technical status" amounts to.38 I think Boers tries too hard to press into Xapt; itself meanings which depend on the context in which the term is used. When a term is used predicatively, as I maintain Paul uses Xapti, it can be employed 33 xl&amp;pt KTX. D.2, TDNT 9.393-96 (1974). 34 Id., 393, 394-95. 35 Id., 394-95. 36 Id. 37 H.

It is generally agreed that, with rare exceptions, Paul uses itoat; to refer to the action of the verb niaozTeo: roughly, believ- ing or trusting in either God or Jesus.39 This is illustrated by Rom. 4:5, referring to the itiaoT of someone (specifically, Abraham) who does not work but trusts (ittorev(o) God, and by the references to the itioat of those to whom Paul writes as tiaot; "toward God" (1 Thess. 1:8), or "toward the Lord Jesus" (Phlm. 5); taking these also as specifying, like Rom. 4:5, that iaCTt; here means "to trust" God, or Jesus, it is only a small step to understanding Paul's thirteen other references to "your tiaoxt;" in the same way (Rom. 1:8, 12; 1 Cor. 2:5; 15:14, 17; 2 Cor. 1:24; 10:15; Phil. 2:17; 1 Thess. 3:2, 5, 6, 7, 10). Likewise, in Rom. 4:9, 14 Paul uses Itiott; absolute for the same sense of trusting God specified by 4:5. Thus we can take tiaoxt; as a way of referring to the act or state of trusting in God, so that the noun could be sys- tematically eliminated without loss of meaning. Understood in this way, Ctoxa; also has a contrary, "distrust," of which verb, noun and adjective forms are all found in Paul.40 riaoxt is not to be thought of apart from the persons who have it- as though belief could exist without believers. Sometimes Paul speaks of ctiott; as though it were impersonal, but such passages should not be taken too literally. Thus, the reference in Gal. 1:23 to "destroying" itolSt; is shown by the parallel expression in 1:13 to be equivalent to "destroying the church"; irioa; perhaps stands by a kind of metonymy for the church, or perhaps the link is more substantial, suggesting that 39 This is so whether niaixt Xptocro refers to faith in Jesus or ofJesus; if the latter, then Jesus' trust in God is meant. The exceptions to the general rule involve a distinct sense of Tioxat, as in Rom. 3:3, where il driot xoo 09eo) refers to God's faithfulness; here the noun stands for an adjective rather than a verb. It has a contrary, as Paul explains, contrasting God's ;iztat with the a&amp;cttaoi of others. Gal. 5:22, listing iticot; among the fruits of the spirit, may also employ the sense "faithfulness" (so VRSV, JNAB), or perhaps "trustfulness" (so JVB); the context does not tell us, except that the other spiritual fruit are general and abstract in character. 40 &amp;taroexo, Rom. 3:3; a&amp;ittTia, Rom. 3:3; 4:20; 11:20, 23; &amp;aactoo;, 1 Cor. 6:6; 7:12, 13, 14 (2x), 15; 10:27; 14:22 (2x), 23, 24; 2 Cor. 4:4; 6:14, 15. 157</page><page sequence="14">M. WINGER if members of the church should cease to trust God they would aban- don the church; but in neither case is there ioxti ; apart from the believers who trust God.41 Likewise, the "coming" of nidat in Gal. 3:23 and 25 refers to the coming of a time when people trusted or believed, as the close of the immediately preceding verse shows: "... in order that the promise might be given, based on nio;tS in [or: of] Jesus Christ, to those who believe (roig; ittzreOoov)."42 Over all, ticxrt; strikes one as a much more specific term than xapt;. Anything might be a gift; the same might be said of ;iorrt; in its sense of faithfulness (necessarily limited to humans and perhaps a few animal species), but the far more common sense of trusting or believing is nar- rower, requiring a particular kind of object as well as a particular kind of subject. As we have noted, in Paul this object is almost always God (orJesus), and we could perhaps define it more specifically: for instance, as trusting that God will keep certain promises. Still, rioaxt is a quality, having a contrary. The noun can be elim- inated (as I have done in the preceding paragraph) in favor of its cog- nate verb, or sometimes adjective. It is a characterizing universal and not a particular; even though Paul uses the term for faith with a par- ticular object, rather than faith in general, specification of this sort does not render a universal into a particular; it merely distinguishes one universal from another. It is still the case that ioarxtg, thus defined, "can be instanced, or instantiated, by a number of different particular things."43 Thus Paul may have such a belief or attitude, and so may the Roman Christians, and you, and I, just as different things may be tall, or heavy, or blue. Earlier I distinguished between "tall" and "blue," on the ground that colors have a criterion of identity, but "tall" does not. itcrt; is a more difficult case. On the one hand, when Paul speaks of the iaoTt; which a number of different people have (as in iao )rt; icv) he means 4 Likewise with the other verb of 1:23, "to proclaim good news." Although at two other points in Paul's letters this takes a direct object (God's son in Gal. 1:16 and "your faith and love" in 1 Thess. 3:6), in each of these cases we must supply some linking term: the good news concerning God's son, or of your faith and love, or the like; that is, what is directly proclaimed is not "Christ" or "faith and love," or, here, "faith," but news-some statement-about these subjects. The three passages where the verb takes the pleonastic object "good news" (rO6 eayyrXtov; 1 Cor. 15:1; 2 Cor. 11:7; Gal. 1:11) reflect this. 2 Whether AiOlr; 'Iqaoo Xpitro: means tioa-r "in" or "of" Jesus; either way it is personal to someone. 43 S.

On the other hand, we can also make distinctions, just as with any term referring to something a person does or is: my trusting in God is something I do, yours is something you do; to say "I have faith" means something different than saying "you have faith"-we are not just declaring "faith exists," and then affirming that I and you and others are each related to this one faith. As we have already noted, there is no {iaOg apart from the individual persons who have tiost;. What about Aquinas's thesis, that faith is a disposition or habit- not merely something in which one engages from time to time, but an attribute of one's character? I doubt that Paul's letters allow a clear verdict on this question, although perhaps it could be said (as with other ideas of Christian theology) that Thomas's conception is a devel- opment of Paul's. There remains the question of why Paul uses itaoxTt if he means nothing that he could not express with titareow. Probably this ques- tion has no general answer; but if we examine particular passages in Paul's letters we find that while 1rtte0)0 could usually have been used in place of itaor;, the substitution would involve other changes as well. In Rom. 1:8, "that your faith is proclaimed" might be changed to "that proclaims that you believe"-but then Paul would have to specify who makes this proclamation, and the sentence would acquire a detail unnecessary to Paul's point. In 1 Cor. 15:14, "your faith is vain" might be changed to "that you believe is vain," but the Greek KcVOV T6O niCt'reetv )ga&amp; is ambiguous and could also mean "it is vain to believe you." Another alternative would be "you believe vainly," icev&amp;G itcaTE6eTe, but here too there is an ambiguity, for the adverb icevX could refer to the manner of one's belief rather than to its point- lessness. Or perhaps citaCevere e; EiS Kcva or el; o6&amp;ev, "you believe for nothingness" or "for nothing," would serve. I am not prepared to say what nuances these expressions might have had which would have made them inferior for Paul's purposes;" but we know from our own language that subtle distinctions lie behind the choice of expressions, and that the sensitive exploitation of these distinctions is one of the marks separating memorable prose from the pedestrian. According to Frege, such distinctions need not touch the sense of what is said; that 4 Was ei; KicVO?a (which I have not found) unacceptable? Did Paul prefer the KEV- stem to ot6Sv? Did he want to avoid the tense (or mood) which a finite verb must carry? 159</page><page sequence="16">M. WINGER is, they need not affect whether what one says is true or false: "In other words, we must not fail to recognize that the same sense, the same thought, may be variously expressed; thus the difference does not here concern the sense, but only the apprehension, shading or colour- ing of the thought, and is irrelevant for logic."45 What we have said so far about "faith" suggests that while the dis- tinction between a noun and its cognate verb need not entail any dis- tinction in sense, there may nevertheless be a distinction of sense between particular phrases employing nouns and others employing verbs. Such phrases may also be distinguished according to "shading or colouring" rather than sense, and when they are it is not surprising that we, for whom Hellenistic Greek is a dead language preserved in only a handful of writings, may be unable to identify distinctions that would have been felt by those who used the language. This difficulty does not imply that Paul's choice of Kevil iioat; iui&amp;v over 7ttoreexE eiS o'65v was (on the one hand) arbitrary, nor (on the other hand) does it mean that the noun itiaTtg represents some distinct object to which the verb itaorevio could not readily refer. We may take as an example an idea which is often associated in English with the expression "your faith": that faith is something which (in some sense) you possess. Likewise in Greek, n{iart; viutov could con- vey possession, for the genitive of possession is an established use of the genitive case; but this interpretation is acceptable only if Tiioat is something which can be possessed, which is just the question. This is not the only possible sense of /&amp;-v with a noun; very often in such cases i)ov is the subjective genitive which identifies the performer of an action represented by the noun, as in (to use examples only from Paul) Tiv Zoyticv Xarpeiav i)W&amp;v, "your rational worship" (Rom. 12:1); 1 ... gdov i)naKco/i, "your obedience" (Rom. 16:19; cf. 2 Cor. 7:15; 10:6); Tx icai6XnCa iliv, "your boast" (1 Cor. 5:6; Phil. 1:26; cf. 2 Cor. 1:14); Xt lcotvovia )6iv, "your sharing" (Phil. 1:5), and 'n ; Dpiv eivaoeox;, "your prayer" (Phil. 1:19). All of these parallel the understanding I have suggested for iaoxTl in Paul's letters.46 45 "Concept and Object," 185 n. 7. One may wonder how sharply one should sep- arate distinctions in "sense" from distinctions in "colouring" (perhaps these are matters of degree rather than kind), but certainly in some cases it is very difficult to distinguish senses. 46 The genitive is also often used to identify the object of an action, as in wveiav vibiv, "remembrance of you" (Rom. 1:9; cf. Phil. 1:3); iv IckoIav bPc2v, "your calling" (1 Cor. 1:26); and IOv gcetpaioov uiGv, "testing of you" (Gal. 4:14).

Here is a difficulty with "colouring"; it may be in the eye of the beholder, the writer may not intend it or even be aware of it-a difficulty added to the other, already noted, that we have no good way of judging the shadings of Hellenistic Greek anyway, and certainly cannot do so based on the shadings which an English rendering has for us. I turn now to a word which, as I noted earlier in this essay, pre- sents different issues. 'Aya, Here is another term prominent in Paul, indeed a cornerstone of what the New Testament has to say about life in the church: a&amp;ydTa, "love." Paul is unusual among New Testament writers in his preference for this noun over the cognate verb adyanco: he uses the noun 47 times and the verb 18, while elsewhere in the New Testament the noun is found 69 times, the verb 125.47 Nevertheless Paul's use of the verb is instructive, for the verb is precise at points where the noun may be vague. In Greek as in English, "to love" is transitive and ordinarily has an explicit object as well as an explicit subject. Paul uses it eight times with both a human subject and object, seven times with God or Christ as the subject and a human object, and three times with a human subject and God or Christ as the object.48 In Rom. 13:8, 9 and Gal. 5:14 Paul invokes the command to love one's neighbor as oneself, the New Testament's chief text on love. The noun "love" ordinarily has neither subject nor object, but usu- ally the context indicates both-as in Rom. 13:10 ("love does no wrong"), where we know from 13:9 that love for neighbors is meant, or 2 Cor. 13:13, where Paul refers to God's love for the Corinthians. Sometimes, however, the context is ambiguous, and in this case one 47 The record of usage suggests that the noun developed after the verb, and so from it.

WINGER must choose among the possibilities; thus Rom. 5:5 ("the love of God was poured into our hearts") was long taken to refer to human love for God, but now is generally interpreted in just the reverse way. In other cases one may conclude that multiple subjects and objects are intended-that in Phil. 2:1, for example ("if there is any... consola- tion of love"), "consolation of love" refers both to God's love for the Philippians, and to their love for one another. If so, we may also be inclined to think that Paul refers to a love which transcends any par- ticular subject or object. But Paul is not speaking of love with no sub- ject or object-an incoherent idea. To refer to two distinct cases in a single phrase is not to confuse them; it does not mean that Paul treats one love (say, one's for neighbor) as a simple corollary of another (say, one's for God).49 Let us examine some of the difficult cases, noting as we pass some which are not so difficult. 1 Cor. 13 belongs in this latter category; although this chapter is sometimes taken as an illustration of love objectified, that is overly literal. Verses 1, 2, and 3 ("though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love...") are plain: to have love means to love, and while the object of this love is not specified, this entire letter is addressed to how the Corinthians should behave to each other; certainly love for one another is meant here.50 Verses 4 through 7 ("love is patient...") now personify love; but what is said of love refers to the one who loves; it is that person who is patient, kind, and so forth-the details of this account confirming that it is the behavior of the Corinthians to one another which is at issue here. The rhetorical figure of personification does not cause words to take on a mystical level of meaning out of keeping with their con- text; but in this case Paul's figure of speech has encouraged loose speech in many of his readers. Conzelmann writes of verses 4-7 that they display "personifying style," or "Wisdom style," and cites Spicq, who compares love here to "la oocpia hypostasiee... envisagee tant6t par rapport a Dieu, tantot dans l'ame du pieux dont elle inspire les pensees et dirige l'action."5' The parallel with Wisdom is instructive. Everyone now knows that Wisdom is personified in the wisdom liter- 49 There might be such a relationship. But this would have to be shown; it does not follow by default. 50 Or love for one's neighbor. Whether this would include non-believers is uncer- tain, but does not matter for our purposes. 51 Hans Conzelmann, 1 Corinthians (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1975) 223; C.

The classic text, personified wisdom's speech in Sirach 24, is metaphor- ical through and through, from "I covered the earth like mist" (v. 3) to "my river [became] a sea" (v. 31) and "instruction shining like the dawn" (v. 32), and if these metaphors are not to be taken literally, how should we then take the personification of wisdom? And in the same chapter ooqpia also retains its ordinary abstract significance, declar- ing in v. 34: "I have not labored only for myself but for all who seek her"-that is, wisdom-which (since wisdom is the speaker) thus changes its sense from the beginning of the sentence (wisdom personified) to its end (wisdom as being wise). Or has it? What does it mean to personify an attribute? A person is not an attribute, even if it is given the name of one; it is wrong to ask whether we should take such a figure of speech literally, for that cannot be done; if "wisdom" is a person it is not wisdom, and if it is wisdom it is not a person. If wisdom is a per- son, what sort of person is she? How would one recognize her? What is her criterion of identity? In an expression like "wisdom opens her mouth" (Sir. 24:2) we can take "wisdom" literally, or "opens her mouth" literally, but not both. There is really no choice to be made here, however, for if "wisdom" does not refer to the attribute of being wise, all that is said about wis- dom in Sirach collapses into nonsense. In 1:16, "the fullness of wisdom is to fear the Lord; she intoxicates with her fruits," where wisdom is made an object although not a person, the first half of the verse serves as a reminder that the writer refers not to a vine but to a quality. There are metaphors for wisdom throughout Sirach (a field in 6:19, a boulder in 6:21, game in 14:22, a house in 14:23-24, a tree in 14:26), of which personified wisdom is only one.52 But none of these metaphors serves any purpose if "wisdom" does not, at bottom and in each case, refer to being wise. In the same way, love personified in 1 Cor. 13:4-7 follows imme- diately on love in 13:1-3 as a quality one may have, without any change in the actual referent for love. If the referent shifted, the argu- ment would make no sense.53 The declaration in verses 8 through 13 52 Likewise Wisdom of Solomon. In 7:22 wisdom is described as a person, in 7:25 as a vapor or breath, in 7:26 as a mirror; she is said to enter holy souls in 7:27 and everything in 7:28. In Prov. 9:5 (LXX) wisdom invites those who lack understanding to eat her bread and drink her wine; since the bread and wine are certainly metaphor- ical, what basis have we for taking the invitation literally? (Overall, and notwithstand- ing chapters 8 and 9, wisdom in Proverbs is generally not personified.) 53 Conzelmann's claim (223-24) that Jewish parallels to w. 4-7 show that Paul's 163</page><page sequence="20">M. WINGER that love will not end, which might be ambiguous out of context, refers to the love identified in the preceding verses: that of believers for one another. No doubt Paul would also say the same thing about humans' love for God, and God's for humans. But this does not mean that Paul says it here in 1 Cor. 13. I have turned to literary evidence, as seems appropriate when con- struing texts. However, it may be suggested that other kinds of evi- dence show that inhabitants of the early Roman Empire were quite willing to personify abstractions, or at least certain ones; for we know cults of abstract divinities in both the Latin and Greek worlds, includ- ing Fortuna and Victoria, TXZTI and O:ti;.54 This is true; but its significance is uncertain. If the worship of TD;l suggests that TiTXr was a person or object, the failure to worship 'AyaTr might suggest that it was not. Moreover, the literary evidence on oogpia shows that the significance of personalizing language is open to question; Walbank observes of Titii that "how far men really personalized such an abstrac- tion and whether they had any consistent view about it is a problem almost impossible to answer."55 The ambiguity of cultic evidence emerges in an anecdote from Suetonius's life of Vitellius. When that emperor, wishing to show his desire for peace, went to lay his dagger in the temple of Concordia, the leading citizens called him back, "adcla- mantibus ipsum esse Concordiam," whereupon he declared that he would take Concordia for a surname (Vitellius 15). Axtell remarks, "Now, these sycophants did not consider him the feminine deity Concordia, but the spirit of Concord. Neither they nor he would have given him meaning transcends specific loves ("for example... love for God or love for man" [224 n. 53]) is fallacious; parallels from other contexts cannot show the reference in this context. Gordon Fee's suggestion (The First Epistle to the Corinthians, [NICNT; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1987] 636-37) that v. 4a ("love is patient and kind") refers to God is only superficially plausible; Paul has been talking explicitly of human love, and any- way w. 4b-7 ("is not jealous or boastful...") cannot refer to God. 54 See, for example, W.

In this connection it is interesting that, according to Latte (Romische Religions- geschichte, 314), personifications appear principally in official cults rather than private ones. 164</page><page sequence="21">NAMES AND ABSTRACTIONS IN PAUL'S LE'I-'ERS the designation Juno or Minerva."56 The existence of a cult does not prove that what is worshipped is a person rather than a quality.57 This is consistent with a point made by recent treatments of Fortuna and Victory. Fears says that "as a cult figure Victoria was regarded both as an autonomous divine force and as a gift granted to the state by the intervention of Jupiter," and "could also be regarded as an aspect of a divinely favored mortal," as in Victoria Caesaris and the like.58 But this characteristic of belonging to many different things is exactly what one expects with a quality rather than a person. Likewise Fortuna, according to Kajanto, is found in many forms, including bona, brevis, mala and salutaris, and especially in the "varieties... Fortuna Augusta or Augusti, the guardian spirit of the emperor, an equivalent of his Genius, and Fortuna Redux, the power that guarded the return of the emperor from dangerous foreign journeys."59 In the same way, TiXrl in the Greek world might be associated with a specific city.60 To return to Paul: I have noted that "the love of God poured into our hearts through the holy spirit" (Rom. 5:5) has been taken by some interpreters to mean God's love for humans, and by others, humans' love for God.61 This reflects the classic difficulty, in Greek as in English, with genitives attached to nouns that have cognate verbs; the genitive may identify either the subject or the object of the verbal action, and only the context can tell which is meant. Here, love "in our hearts" 56 Axtell, Deification, 81. 57 We may also question whether pagan cults will reveal Paul's thinking. But this objection is inconclusive. Granting that Paul would not have participated in such a cult, he could still have shared the worshipers' perception that there was some thing they worshipped-as in Gal. 4:8 Paul refers to "beings which are not in nature gods." As to deified abstractions, however, this does not advance us from Walbank's gesture of hopelessness. 58 Fears, "Theology of Victory," 744, 745. 59 Kajanto, "Fortuna," 510-16, 517. Axtell (Dejfication, 89) observes that "such modifiers are not characteristic of, but alien to, the anthropomorphic gods." 60 Burkert, Greek Religion, 186. The diverse sources I have invoked, Latin and Greek, pagan and Jewish, leave us to wonder why, if no person is really meant, a person still is spoken of. This is a version of the question of why one may speak figuratively, and our lack of a convincing answer does not mean that there is no figure. Webster makes a fruitful suggestion in his treatment of Greek personification (at 13): "with a few excep- tions... personifications of abstracts do not persist with the same kind of permanent and developing individuality as the Olympian gods, but are deified at moments of great and compelling emotion." A modem example illustrates the point. When Sky Masterson, the gambler in the musical Guys and Dolls, pauses before a crucial roll of the dice to sing, "Luck, be a lady tonight," this shows the depth of his feelings, not necessarily his understanding of what kind of beings inhabit the universe. 61 Most commentators (e.g., Barrett, Cranfield, Dunn, Kasemann, Fitzmyer) take the first view; but see Barth and Stuhlmacher. 165</page><page sequence="22">M. WINGER sounds like human love, and the reference to its being poured "through the holy spirit" fits with Paul's identification of love as a "fruit of the spirit" in Gal. 5:22. On the other hand, just after this verse Paul refers to "love of him [God]" (5:8) in a way which makes it clear that God is the lover, and it is natural to take the earlier phrase in the same way; this also seems to make the best sense of the relation between v. 5 and the verses which precede and follow it.62 None of the argu- ments is conclusive. Granting the ambiguity of Paul's expression, it does not follow that Paul merges God's love and ours, only (at most) that the two are related. Love is a natural response to love; but Paul suggests a more particular connection: God's love prompted him to send Christ (Rom. 5:8); with Christ God sent the spirit (Gal. 4:6); and with the spirit comes love (Gal. 5:22). Perhaps it would have been more precise for Paul to have said that the spirit is poured into human hearts through love,63 but Paul's association of the concepts is more important than his suggestion of the mechanics of that association. On the other hand, I think Dodd's apparent equation of love and spirit invites the kind of confusion which abstract nouns sometimes engender.64 The spirit, though it may be immaterial, is nevertheless concrete--a particular, not a universal. This does not mean Paul cannot, by metonymy, refer to the spirit by a term which elsewhere refers to a quality, and &amp;aya&amp;m could be such a term, standing on this occasion for the spirit because it happens to be one manifestation of the spirit. But love and spirit are not thereby the same, and love is not therefore a particular. 62 The full statement in v. 5 is, "Hope does not shame us, because the love of God has been poured into our hearts through the holy spirit." "Hope" here looks back to v. 2, "hope of [sharing] the glory of God," and it would seem that God's love for humans is a better warrant for this hope than is humans' love for God. Then w. 6-11 (introduced by the particle yap which usually marks an explanation for what has just been said) argue that Christ's death for humans as sinners shows God's love for humans, and "much more" (v. 9) shall humans, having now been justified, be saved. Still, the connection between &amp;yar&amp;r in w. 5 and 8 is rough; there is a shift from love felt to love logically demonstrated. In any case, w. 6-11 do not explain the love of v. 5b, but the hope of v. 5a; nothing rules out distinct references to both human love (v. 5) and God's (v. 8). 63 Kasemann's and Barrett's interpretations imply this (Ernst Kasemann, Commentary on Romans [Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1980] 135-36; Barrett, Romans, 105). The prophet Joel tells us that the Lord promises to "pour out" (cKXeo) his spirit (3:1 [LXX]), and that his people "will not be ashamed" (Kaxtaiaoxvf) (2:26); Paul's association of the same terms in Rom. 5:5 suggests that he has Joel in mind. Spirit and heart are also associated in five other Pauline passages (Rom. 8:27; 2 Cor. 1:22; 3:3; Gal. 4:6). 64 "Since the nature of God himself is love, in giving us love He imparts to us some- thing of His own nature, or, in Pauline language, His Spirit."

Fitzmyer, Romans, 398. 166</page><page sequence="23">NAMES AND ABSTRACTIONS IN PAUL'S LETTERS Another interesting passage is Gal. 5:6, "for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but faith working through love." To what ay&amp;crml does Paul refer, and how does it relate to tiort;? These two abstract nouns are found together in eight other Pauline passages, distinguished from one another in 1 Cor. 13 (espe- cially vv. 2 and 13), associated in 2 Cor. 8:7; Gal. 5:22; 1 Thess. 1:3; 3:6; 5:8; Phlm. 5. It is clear that Paul expects (or assumes) that believers will be both faithful and loving, but it is not so clear-despite Gal. 5:6-that Paul has a developed theory of their relationship. Since in Gal. 5:13-14 ayarim is love of neighbor, and since the issue throughout 5:2-15 is the law, which is brought to completion by love of neighbor, this love is the evident topic in 5:6. Betz cuts aya6mr loose from this context when he writes that the Christian "becomes a channel for the divine power of aydamr."65 It is probably "working" (evepyouEt?V)l) which leads Betz to translate the act of loving into the power to do so, and then to attribute this power to an entity which Paul himself does not refer to. Finally, there is Philippians 2:1-2, on which we touched above. Here Paul writes, "Therefore, if there is any encouragement in Christ, any consolation in love, any fellowship in the spirit, any compassion or mercy, complete my joy by thinking the same thing and having the same love, a common mind, and one thought." This passage should not be interpreted with greater precision than Paul employed in fashion- ing it. There are not five distinct thoughts in the first clause and four in the second, but clusters of expressions directed, as Paul says, at one general thought: the Philippians' unity.66 In this exhortation love is both a ground and a goal; but what love? In v. 1 Paul indicates love's object (the Philippians) but not its subject, and in v. 2 its subject (also the Philippians) but not its object, and the various possible subjects in v. 1 each have their support: God's love, or Christ's, or Paul's, or the Philippians'.67 If the same love is meant in both places it must be the Philippians' love for one another, and in fact Paul says "the same love" ('rv arirnv &amp;ayamniv) in v. 2. But this begs the question. "The same" here 65 Betz, Galatians, 263; cf. 264 (the Christian "receives the divine power of love which enabled Christ to do what he did"). 66 Many of the key terms here are not clearly distinguished in meaning. Translators tend to use the same English terms in rendering it, but not always in the same places. 67 Respectively, G. Fee, Paul's Letter to the Philippians (NICNT; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1995) 180; F.W. Beare, The Epistle to the Philippians (HNTC; New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1959) 71; G.F.

WINGER could mean: each of you have the same love as each other (which is the dominant theme of this verse and is what "the same" means in "thinking the same"); it could also mean love of the same kind: for instance, as God loved you, so you love each other. The fact is, Paul does not specify the love of v. 1, perhaps because he takes its identity for granted, but perhaps because the ambiguity is useful. Whatever love the Philippians themselves find "consoling" is for that reason the love that best serves Paul's argument.68 Still this ambiguity does not entail any confusion. If v. 1 suggested no particular love at all, but only love in general, how would it invoke any consolation? It would be useless to Paul's exhortation. There is no love "in general": only specific loving; a quality or concept; an action, not an entity. 'A,uapzTa Finally, sin. &amp;gapTia has a different feel to it than the terms we have just looked at, not only because it refers to something evil, but because Paul's language so often treats a&amp;iapxia concretely. What we have to consider is how such language is to be taken. 'Agaptia appears principally in Romans 3 through 8 (46 uses-31 in Rom. 6 and 7-out of 59 overall), an extended passage which there- fore requires some general attention. Within this passage the cognate verb &amp;iLapraavo appears seven times, and, as we shall see, Paul's usage of ai&amp;ap-a&amp;vo sheds some light on his usage of &amp;ioapria. The noun emerges in 3:9: "For we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin (bn6b ai&amp;apTiav)." Commentators generally find here a reference to sin as a "power," many adding that sin is here "personified."69 So far as this verse is concerned, "personification" is used loosely, and even the idea of sin as a power depends on reading later passages back into this one. Here, the verb nTponxiaoa[eO0a ("we 8 For this reason I think Silva's generally sound assessment goes astray at the end. Silva writes (Philippians [Grand Rapids: Baker, 1992] 102) that questions such as what love Paul refers to "cannot be answered with any certainty. Nor should they. The clauses are deliberately compressed and vague, since the appeal is primarily emotional." If the last phrase invokes the modem distinction between the emotional and the rational, then it imposes an opposition that would have puzzled Paul, and, in any event, does not fit Paul's argument. 69 On personification, see C.E.B. Cranfield, A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans (ICC; Edinburgh: Clark, 1975) 191; Fitzmyer, Romans, 331; P. Meyer, "Romans," inJ.L. Mays, ed., Harper's Bible Commentary (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1988) 1130-67, 1139; on power, also J.D.G. Dunn, Romans (WBC; Waco: Word, 1988) 143; Kasemann, Romans, 86. 168</page><page sequence="25">NAMES AND ABSTRACTIONS IN PAUL'S LE'1-1ERS have already charged") sends us back to look for the charge, and we pull up naturally at the previous reference to sin, in 2:12: "For who- ever sinned (O0ot... iiapxov) outside the law, will perish outside the law, and whoever sinned in the law will be judged by the law." Not that "sin" as such is emphasized in Romans 2; a number of parallel expressions are employed, either as synonyms ("to do evil," 2:9) or as antonyms ("doers of the law," 2:13; "to do the things of the law," 2:14; "to do the law," 2:25; "to keep the commands of the law," 2:26; "to keep the law," 2:27). With this background, the natural reading of gno axapitav in 3:9 is as an expression equivalent to a&amp;apTavetv-and indeed, what is said in 3:9 with the noun is repeated in 3:23 with the verb: "All have sinned." The idea of power has not been suggested, nor can it be found in the scriptural passages which Paul brings for- ward in the succeeding verses (10-18) to substantiate the charge that all are 'n6 aticapriav. There is no power here unless the preposition ha6 is itself sufficient to suggest it, or unless it may be read back into 3:9 from what Paul says later. This last point we necessarily defer, only noting in passing that the general reader (if not the scholar) is prob- ably more likely to read what follows according to the ideas suggested by what precedes, than to proceed in the reverse fashion. As for the pre- position, I doubt that much can be made to rest upon it. Prepositions are notoriously various in their meaning, and their use is often idiom- atic; what is the sense of "in" in the English expression "to live in sin"? Does the preposition here invoke the idea of a realm characterized (somehow) by sin, which is inhabited by couples who live together while unmarried? Not, probably, for most English speakers. Paul uses "under sin" twice later, in passages which suggest that sin has some power: "sold under sin" in Rom. 7:14 and "confined under sin" in Gal. 3:22. But in both of these places it is the verb, not the preposition, which suggests a constraint, and there is no such verb in Rom. 3:9. Moreover, when &amp;aapxia next appears, in 3:20, it is not concrete at all: "for through law comes knowledge of sin." What humans know through the law is, as most commentators say, what is sinful, or the corollary (according to Paul) that everyone sins.70 Paul's next two references to &amp;aiaptia, in 4:7-8, are borrowed from Ps. 31:1-2 (LXX), and employ the sense, rare in Paul, of individual 70 Barrett, Romans, 71; Cranfield, Romans, 199; Kasemann, Romans, 89; Meyer, "Romans," 1139. Dunn (Romans, 160).and Fitzmyer (Romans, 339) add that one learns of sin's power, but that idea is not drawn from this verse. 169</page><page sequence="26">M. WINGER sinful acts.71 The case for &amp;capTia as concrete-and even personal- rests principally on chapters 5, 6 and 7, where some of Paul's lan- guage makes that suggestion: "sin came into the world" (5:12); "sin reigned" (5:21; cf. 6:12) or "rules" (6:14); "slaves of sin" (6:16, 17, 20); freed from sin (6:18-22); "sin dwelling in me" (7:17, 20). But, as with love and wisdom, to say that sin is personified begs the question. What does it mean to present sin as a person? What sort of person is this, and what relation has it to sin, as that is ordinarily conceived? The answers to these questions lie in the passage we are examining. In 5:12 Paul writes, "Therefore, as sin (a&amp;ap{ia) came into the world through one man, and death through sin, so also death entered all humans because all sinned (igaptov)." Here, "sin" plainly means "to sin," and "sin came into the world through one man" means "one man sinned." Similarly, in 5:19 "sinner" (&amp;gaptoLX6;) is used to express the same thought: "through the disobedience of one, many became sinners"-that is, many sinned. In 5:20, "sin abounded" means that there was much sinning. This brings us to 5:21: "as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our lord." Sin is indeed personified in this verse, or at any rate in its first clause-as grace is personified in its second. Yet grace is not a person; we have already seen that XaptS is used here to refer to Christ, in a way which calls attention to the human condition thanks to Christ.72 "Sin" is used differently; no figure is mentioned to whom "sin" might refer, unless we construe Sin as such a figure. As with love, however, this confuses rather than explains what Paul wrote. I take 5:21a to recall what Paul said in similar language in 5:12: that all sinned, and because all sinned, all died. While Paul writes as though sin were a person, this form of expression is not intended to efface the essential reference of "sin" to the act of sinning. If that connection is broken then Rom. 5:21 has no sense. From 5:21 we proceed to 6:1, "shall we continue in sin?" and 6:2, "How shall we who died to sin live in it?" In both of these verses sin is abstract, not concrete; in v. 1 "continue in sin" means "continue to 71 This sense is clear in 4:7, where the plural is used ("blessed is the one... whose sins are covered"), which naturally determines the reference in v. 8 as well. Similarly, in 5:13 "sin is not counted if there is no law," the verb (Xoyho) is cognate to the verb of 4:8 (Xoyiologat), and probably the reference in 5:13 is also to sinful acts. 72 See above, at n. 29 and following. 170</page><page sequence="27">NAMES AND ABSTRACTIONS IN PAUL'S LErI-tEKS sin," and in v. 2 "death to sin" and "life in it" mean first of all (what- ever else the metaphor suggests) sinning and not sinning. No cosmic power is implied here.73 In "the body of sin" (6:6), "of sin" (riS; a&amp;apciax) is equivalent to "sinful" (&amp;giapxcoS6); so also with "passions of sin" in 7:5 and "flesh of sin" in 8:3. At the same time Rom. 6:6 introduces us to further terms which objectify sin: "enslaved to sin" in 6:6, followed by "slaves of sin" in 6:16, 17 and 20, and contrasted with freedom from sin in 6:18 and 22; along the way Paul also speaks again of sin "reigning" or "ruling" (6:12, 14). Even within this passage, however, &amp;aapxtia is not consistently concrete. According to 6:7, a person who has died is "justified" or "acquitted" (6Sticaitmai) from sin, which must therefore mean sinfulness, or guilt.74 In 6:10 and 11 Paul writes of death "to sin" ( &amp;axapTric), in which "death" is certainly metaphorical, but a very awkward metaphor if "sin" means a living master: in that case "death to sin" would imply that the master has conquered "once for all" (6:10). Although a concrete sense for sin is possible in these verses, nothing in particular suggests it (five of the six immediately preceding uses of the term are abstract).75 Sin is personified within Romans 6, but we still must decide how literally to take this personification. Throughout, the conception of sin as sinning underlies what Paul wrote, while the figure of personification is never pressed to the limit. We can see this in some of the parallels and substitutes Paul employs for personified sin. While in 6:11, 22 and 23 &amp;opxTia is parallel to 0e6S, in 6:16 SboBot... &amp;aapxia; is parallel to 8oBo .... v7taKoifS; in 6:17 fxte bo,ot o fi &amp;rigap.iaS is parallel to 'Unalcovaae ...

Sim. 6.1: "See, I have foretold everything to you, so that I will be absolved (6&amp;KaicoG0) from the sins of your souls." The NRSV rendering of Rom. 6:7, "freed from sin," is slightly misleading, for it suggests that the sense is equivalent to *Xei)epo9evreS axo Tfi' a&amp;oapriaS in 6:18 and 22. But 6:7, unlike 6:18 and 22, does not suggest that sin is a master. 75 A related metaphor appears in 6:23, "the wages of sin is death...." Here too sin could be abstract ("the wages paid for sin") or concrete ("the wages paid by sin"); but because sin has been treated concretely in 6:12 through 22, that is the natural under- standing here. 171</page><page sequence="28">M. WINGER refer to various concrete powers. Similarly, for &amp;gapzia itself Paul can substitute &amp;Xca0apoia and avoria (compare 6:13, ceptaaxvesre ra&amp; pin itCDV ... Tr &amp;alapTia, with 6:19, ncapoeaxoatae r&amp;a pXq 4)oV 8oivXa T a&amp;ica- oapoic Kai Tcc avopi{); but it is questionable that we should regard these abstractions as further concrete powers allied with sin. Most interesting are the parallels suggested in 6:12-13 between a&amp;aptia, it0o{Ciat oabaToog, and aciKia. These verses read: [a] Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal bodies [a'] so that you obey their desires, [b] nor turn your members over to sin [b'] as instruments of wickedness... I have divided this passage into four parts-two pairs of more-or-less equivalent statements, with the first statement of each pair employing "sin" but the second a different term, "desires," or "wickedness." Letting sin reign in one's body is roughly equated with obeying the body's desires; turning one's members over to sin means making them instru- ments of wickedness; all four expressions say approximately the same thing. Like the other variations of language we have noted, these sug- gest that the figure of sin as a ruling force is useful but not indis- pensable to Paul's argument. Here, however, one expression stands out: "desires of the body" (ecit0uiat acOXlaoS) differs from the other parallel terms Paul uses in Romans 6, for there is nothing abstract about a desire. Let us set this point aside for the moment. If the fluidity of Paul's language suggests that his references to sin as though it were a ruling power are metaphorical, the next question is what this metaphor is meant to suggest. If Paul does not literally mean that humans are either obedient to or free from sin as a personal, ruling master, what does he mean? Here the central piece of Paul's argument seems to be 6:16, according to which one must be either a slave to sin or a slave to obedience (that is, obedience to God). As Barrett says, "Paul assumes that men will be slaves, and obedient, to a good master or a bad. Independence is impossible."76 It follows that xapxaxpa, when it is used concretely, should refer to something which one can obey. What could this be, if not a personal power? An answer is immediately at hand in 6:12, where "obedience" first appeared in this passage: one may obey the desires of the body. 76 Barrett, Romans, 132. 172</page><page sequence="29">NAMES AND ABSTRACTIONS IN PAUL'S LkI-IE KS Again, let us put this aside for the moment, and move on to Romans 7 and 8. &amp;aapxia continues to be prominent in these chapters, and it is often used concretely-ten times in the nominative case, although two of these are predicate nominatives that may have the abstract sense "sinful."77 But the vocabulary has changed from chapter 6; while lan- guage of obedience and freedom continues, these terms no longer attach to sin, but to law (7:3, 6, 23, 25; 8:2). A different vocabulary is now employed with sin: sin is "in me" (7:8, 17, 20), or "in our/my mem- bers" (7:5, 23), or "in the flesh" (7:5); "under sin" I am "fleshly" (7:14), and "with flesh" I "serve the law of sin" (7:25). Also prominent now are accounts of sin "working" (7:8, 13, 17, 20), and this is the lan- guage which in chapter 7 most strongly suggests that a&amp;apTia refers to something concrete. But this only returns us to the question of what this concrete thing may be. Parallel to Paul's references to sin "work- ing" is 7:5: "the sinful passions (&amp;ra taoilara 'r v a&amp;apittxv) worked in our members through the law to bear fruit to death."78 The suggestion of 6:12 and 16, that obedience to sin means obedience to desire, here is translated into new language, that the work of sin means the work of the passions-a connection underscored by Chapter 7's repeated descriptions of sin as "within" the one who sins. The fundamental con- nection of sin to sinful acts always remains. This is the presumption of 7:7-12, where sin means violation of the commandments found in the law. Likewise the emphasis in 7:13-25 on what one does preserves the link between sin and action.79 Thus "sin" refers to what is sinful; it is a concept or quality, some- times expressed by the terms "evil" (iKac6v), or "transgression" (napatrola), or "disobedience" (aclpaKcoi).80 It would seem that "sin" has a contrary, 77 The predicate nominatives are in 7:7 ("Is the law sin[ful]?") and 13 ("sin, in order that it might be seen as sin[ful]"). 78 With this connection of passions to death, compare that of sin to death in 6:16; 7:13; 8:2, 10. 79 This applies as well to Gal. 2:17, where Paul asks whether, if Jewish Christians have become sinners by their violation of Jewish food laws, this means that Christ is a "servant of sin." Although this could be interpreted as a personification of sin, Paul makes no use of this figure. His ground for denying that Christ serves sin, as devel- oped in the difficult argument of 2:18-21, appears to be that violating the food laws is not in fact sinful (the term "sinner," which 2:15 applies to Gentiles as a matter of definition, is likely meant ironically). The issue, therefore, is simply whether Christ causes one to sin. (As the answer to this question is no, this passage would in any case be indifferent evidence for the existence of sin as a power.) 80 For KaKiv, see Rom. 2:9, 3:8; 7:19; for napataogXa, see Rom. 5:15, 16, 17, 20; for xapaicofi, see Rom. 5:19. In each of these passages the term is used in proximity to a&amp;aptia or (Rom. 2) &amp;alapTavo. 173</page><page sequence="30">M. WINGER namely "not sinning," an idea which appears in the expressions "doer of the law" (iotrnTil v6o'o), Rom. 2:13), and "to do good" (eFpyaioliat Toaya6ov, Rom. 2:10; Karepya, oaL to KicaXv, Rom. 7:18; noleto ayao6v, Rom. 7:19; iTotCo Tb IcaX6v, Rom. 7:21).81 Passages which present sin as a person or object, such as those we have noted in Romans 6 and 7, come among others which do not. This is the pattern we saw with wisdom and love, and it cautions us against taking sin literally as a personified or objectified power. If it is a power, what power is it? What is its criterion of identity? No answer appears in Paul's use of this term, except that it causes sin, which is not a real answer to our question. The key point Paul makes by his objectification of sin, that sinful human acts reflect forces or impulses which humans do not control, he also makes without using the term "sin." In Gal. 5:16-25 Paul depicts his readers as caught between opposing flesh and spirit, "so that whatever you want, you do not do" (5:17). Paul then lists the fruit of the flesh: fornication and impurity, jealousy and anger, envy and drunkenness, "and things like these" (5:19-21). These are sins, and people do not choose them but are driven to them, just as, according to Rom. 7:19, they are driven to "the evil [they] do not want." In one account, the motive force is called the flesh, and in the other, "sin dwelling in me"-alternative ways of referring to the same thing, which is not sin itself (whatever that might mean), but the desire or impulse to sin. This use of "sin" is, at any rate, exceptional; most of the time Paul uses the term, in various constructions, to refer to the action of sinning. Summay Our limited survey has mostly shown us that Paul uses abstract nouns to refer to the action of cognate verbs. These nouns typically stand for universals, not particulars, qualities not substances, concepts not objects. When this usage implies an object, especially when that is a concrete object, it is generally figurative. One measure of this is the intimate 8I Similar expressions also occur elsewhere, but in all of these passages contrasting references to sin or sinning are close at hand. "Righteousness" (6Kalcatoo&lt;vi) is also con- trasted with "sin," for example in Rom. 3:20-21 ("through the law comes knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of God has been manifested...") and 6:20 ("when you were slaves of sin you were free in regard to righteousness"), but it is not clear that sin and righteousness are simple opposites. 174</page><page sequence="31">NAMES AND ABSTRACTIONS IN PAUL'S LE'II'RKS 175 link between the apparent object and the quality or concept to which the term ordinarily refers. A second measure is the absence of any cri- terion of identity, such as ordinarily characterizes an object. We find thus that grace, faith, love and sin (like wisdom) are not names, because what they name is simply the act (or state) of giving, believing, loving and sinning (or being wise).</page></plain_text>
