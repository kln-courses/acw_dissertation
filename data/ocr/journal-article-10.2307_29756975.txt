<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Genesis of the Indian Planetary Deities by Stephen Markel As the night without a light, as the sky without the sun, so is a king without an astrologer, like a blind man he erreth on the road i1). As the great 6th-century Indian astronomer Var?hamihira informs us by quoting his 1st century predecessor Garga, astrologers have long been considered indispensable to a successful negotiation of the often murky and obstacle-strewn path of just sovereignty. Consultations with diviners of heavenly portents were by no means the sole prerogative of kings, however, as traditional Hindus at all levels of society still believe it imperative before undertaking any activity, journey, or ritual to consult professional astrologers to avoid the various inauspicious planetary conjunctions and their resultant malevolent influences (2). Indeed, the power of astrology is held in such awe that for ages in countless households throughout India, the gods who personify the planets have been worshipped every morning in order to propitiate and placate them, thereby obtaining their benevolent grace. Surprisingly, however, the origin of these all-important divinities has been little studied and the cross-cultural components of their conception and evolution have remained obscure. Accordingly, this essay will explicate their genesis and define their manifold nature. Relevant textual sources will be discussed to trace their literary development. Special reference will be paid to the influence of Hellenistic astronomy and Roman astrology, as well as the imported Western calendrical system of the seven day week. Finally, a few representative sculptural depictions of the planetary deities will be illustrated to suggest their range of artistic expression and iconographic forms (3). 0) H.

[1] 173</page><page sequence="2">The Indian Planetary Deities Before beginning the analysis of the literary and historical evolution of the planetary deities, a brief notice of their identity and nature is warranted. The Indian planetary deities are as follows: S?rya (the Sun), Candra (the Moon), Mangala (Mars), Budha (Mercury), Brhaspati (Jupiter), Sukra (Venus), Sani (Saturn), R?hu (the demon of eclipses), and Ketu (the personification of comets). S?rya is by far the most important and oldest of the deities. A much greater body of legends has been associated with him than with the other planetary deities and his artistic representations are the most abundant. Candra ranks second in prominence and amount of sacred lore, but is seldom individually portrayed. The five conventional planets are worshipped mainly for their astrological effect on the course of human events. Individual depictions of these five planetary deities are extremely rare, and are generally found in southern India. Mangala is considered to be a malevolent deity and is generally said to be the son of Siva and the earth goddess. Budha's astrological effect is thought to be neutral and he is the illegitimate son of Candra and T?r?, the wife of Brhaspati. Brhaspati is a benevolent deity and, as the preceptor of the gods, is the most important of the five conventional planetary deities and has enjoyed the longest veneration. Sukra is also considered to be benevolent, but as the spiritual teacher of the demons he is often pitted against Brhaspati in celestial conflicts. Sani is believed to be malevolent and is the second most powerful planetary deity next to S?rya. R?hu was well-known in Vedic times and was included with the other seven planetary deities in some of the earliest artistic representations. In addition, he is occasionally depicted independently of the other planetary deities in the context of myths associated with the Hindu god Visnu. Ketu is a relative newcomer to the group of planetary deities, and is absent in collective representations until after c. A.D. 600. He ? or alternatively, she, as is frequently the case from the eighth century onward ? has the fewest legends and is never separately shown. Various orders are used in Indian texts to list the planetary deities. The grouping followed here is the most common and can be termed the temporal order. It is based on the regency of the planetary deities over the days of the week and, hence, the following sequence is obtained: S?rya (Sunday), Candra (Monday), Mangala (Tuesday), Budha (Wednesday), Brhaspati (Thursday), Sukra (Friday), and Sani (Saturday) (4). (4) The rationale behind the specific arrangement of the seven-day week is as follows: The temporal or week-day order of the planets is an artificial one based upon the natural order [of the progressive distances of the planets from the earth] ? Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, the Moon, and was developed thus: Saturn is the lord of the first hour of the day, Jupiter is the lord of the second hour and so on; consequently the lord of the 25th hour, or first hour of the second day, is the Sun; the lord of the 49th hour or first hour of the third day is the Moon; and so on. The 24 hour day is therefore essential to the scheme and the division of the day into 24 hours nowhere appears in India ? so we must conclude that the week-day order of the planets is of non-Indian origin. Again the week-day order properly begins with Saturn (Saturday) whereas the Hindu week begins with Sunday ? and this is probably due to the same influence as with us (the Jewish-Christian week).

Kaye, Hindu Astronomy, MASI, 18, Calcutta 1924, p. 36. 174 [2]</page><page sequence="3">Early Literary References to the Planets The origins of the planetary deities can be traced back to the earliest Indian literature in the 2nd millennium B.C., but certainly antedate even that ancient period of cultural development. As was the case in many prehistoric cultures, solar and lunar symbols were common artistic motifs during the primordial period of Indian history. Apart from this pan-Indian veneration which was transmitted through the ages via artistic and oral traditions, the earliest literary references to the planets are found in the sacred texts of the early Vedic literature dating from around 1500-1000 B.C. In these hymns and incantations, however, the five then-known planets of the solar system receive scant attention while the Sun, Moon, and stars are given far greater prominence. As the precise observation of astral movements was a prominent concern of the ancient seers of the Vedic period for various ritual and agricultural reasons, certainly at least the brighter planets must have been perceived in their celestial transits. An awareness of the planets can also be inferred in the early Vedic literature through the metaphorical descriptions of certain heavenly phenomena. While there are no explicit references to the planets or planetary deities in the Rgveda, the following references to the 'seven' or 'five' worlds or regions of the heavens are generally interpreted as referring to the planets. The verse which most clearly alludes to the planets states, 'There are seven regions with their different suns [...]' (Rgveda 9:114:3) (5). Another example states, 'May those five bulls [uksanah] which stand on high full in the midst of mighty heaven [...]' (Rgveda 1:105:10) (6). In this verse the bulls probably symbolize the planets because of their brighter luminosity, although bulls or cows are also thought in the Vedas to draw the chariot of Usas, the goddess of dawn. The number 'five' as referring to the planets can also be inferred in the Vedas in connection with the number 'thirty-four'. The thirty-four lights of the heavens (Rgveda 10:55:3) (7) and the thirty-four ribs of the ancient sacrificial horse (Rgveda 1:162:18; see also White Yajurveda 25:41) (8) are normally thought to refer to the sun, moon, five planets, and the twenty-seven lunar asterisms or groups of stars (naksatra) (9). Another passage concerning the number five has also been said to refer (5) F. Max M?ller, transl. and ed., Vedic Hymns, part 1: Hymns to the Maruts, Rudra, Vayu and V?ta, Sacred Books of the East, vol. 32, Oxford 1891 (repr., Delhi 1967, p. 252). (6) R.T.H.

A contrasting_interpretation of the thirty-four entities, as being composed of the eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve Adityas, Praj?pati, Vasatk?ra, and Vir?j, is offered by the 14th-century Vijayanagara commentator on the Rgveda, S?yana. Cited by Griffith Rgveda, 2: 458, fn. 3. [3] 175</page><page sequence="4">to the planets. The verse states, 'Seven holy singers [sages] guard with five Adhvaryus the Bird's [Agni's] beloved firmly-settled station' (Rgveda 3:7:7) (10). The five adhvaryus have been equated with the five planets, but this seems unlikely as the term 'adhvaryu1 specifically designates a class of Vedic priests (n). The first indisputable mention of the planets in Indian literature occurs in the Atharvaveda, where the 'planets [grah?h] wandering in heaven' (19:9:7) are invoked along with the gods Mitra, Varuna, Vivasvat, and Mrtyu in order to secure blessings and prosperity (12). The Atharvaveda is generally dated to c. 1000-500 B.C. (13), although it appears to have been compiled over the course of several centuries and was perhaps later interpolated (14). Thus, while it is likely that the planets were known in the Vedic period, at that early stage of Indian cultural development they had not yet been deified and imbued with astrological powers and personalities. As the following sections of this essay will show, it was not until the mid-2nd century A.D. in India that the planets were given anthropomorphic forms and accorded astrological influences. Historical Context The main stimulus for the personification of the planetary deities was the importation of Hellenistic mathematical astronomy for enhancing the accuracy of predictive astrology and, as a corollary, the contemporary introduction of the seven day week from the West. The rulers and courts primarily responsible for the importation of the new scientific theories into India were the dynastic enclaves of the Western Ksahar?tas, better known as the Ksatrapas (derived from 'satrap'). The Ksatrapas were composed of two branches of the Scythian Sakas who had extended their rule southward to occupy a sizeable portion of western India and the northern Deccan in the 1st through 4th centuries. The 'early' ruling family of the Western Ksatrapas were defeated by the S?tav?hana king Gautamiputra S?takarni (r. c. A.D. 106-30), who was in turn overthrown by the 'later' dynastic lineage, known specifically as the K?rddamaka clan of Ksatrapas and more generally as the Ksatrapas of Saurashtra and Malwa (15).

A.D. 130-60), under whose enlightened patronage astrological texts were translated and numerous other pinnacles of literary and cultural excellence were achieved (16). The Junagadh inscription of A.D. 150 describes the king as a generous and intelligent ruler who patronized a variety of social and academic activities (17). Rudrad?man I reigned from ancient Ujjayini (present-day Ujjain in western Madhya Pradesh). The chief astronomers of the court lived in the capital, and their presence made the city into a center of astronomical learning that was to continue for centuries. Consequently, Ujjain 'became the Greenwich of Indian astronomers and the Arin of the Arabic and Latin astronomical treatises' (18). Thus, there is literary, epigraphical, and historical evidence to indicate that Rudrad?man I's 'interest in the intellectual movements of his time [...] was of fundamental importance for the introduction of Greek astronomy and astrology into India' (19). It is from the period of Rudrad?man I that the earliest and most crucial text for the study of the origin of the planetary deities dates. During the king's reign in Ujjayini in A.D. 149-50, an Alexandrian text on Hellenistic astrology by Yavanesvara was translated into Sanskrit prose (20) . Although the text is now lost, it has survived through a later poem known as the Yavanaj?taka (The Horoscopy of the Greeks), composed by R?ja Sphujidhvaja in A.D. 269-70 during the reign of Rudrasena II (r. c. A.D. 255-76) (21). In the text (1:123-36), S?rya, Candra, and the five conventional planetary deities are anthropomorphized. Their psychological traits are stressed, as well as those of the humans born under their respective sway. The retention of the Hellenistic personalities of the planetary deities suggests that the iconography of the planetary deities was transmitted to India through textual descriptions rather than through Graeco-Roman manuscript illustrations which were reinterpreted by the Indian artists (22). These textual descriptions, however, were not simply translated. The text was expanded to include allusions to Indian mythological figures (1:125-26, 133) and to the sacred lore of the Hindus (1:130).

[5] 177</page><page sequence="6">Besides being the earliest Indian borrowing of the Hellenistic personifications of the planetary deities, the Yavanaj?taka is also important because its descriptive passages formed the basis of a number of later astrological works. At first the Indian astrological texts simply reiterated the verses of the Yavanaj?taka or rephrased them with the same emphasis on the personalities of the planetary deities. Later Indian texts, such as the late 6th century Matsyapur?na and Agnipur?na, represent the total assimilation of the imported calendrical system with the native astro-religious mythology of India. All nine of the planetary deities are described in the temporal order in the verses. The lengthy characterizations of the physical appearance and personalities of the deities in the earlier Graeco-Roman inspired texts are replaced by iconographic descriptions of attributes and religiously significant gestures inherited from imagery associated with Buddhism and pan-Indic ascetic practices. The Hellenistic-derived psychological traits of the divinities are retained only in the conception of the basic nature of the deities. Although later texts occasionally continue to borrow verses from the Yavanaj?taka, most literary and religious works follow the example of the Matsyapur?na and the Agnipur?na and present iconographic conceptions better suited to the culture of India (23). Following the Yavanaj?taka and the Western Ksatrapas, the Indian interest in astronomy and astrology was perpetuated during the Imperial Gupta dynasty. The traditional historical view holds that the territorial domains of the Rudrad?man Ts descendants were invaded and conquered by the Gupta king Candragupta II (r. c. A.D. 380-414), who was also a great patron of cultural pursuits, and thus was Hellenistic astronomy transmitted from the Western Ksatrapas to the Imperial Guptas. This supposition rests on an interpretation of the Mehrauli Iron Pillar inscription in Delhi as describing the sweeping extent of Candragupta II's conquests, the close similarity of Candragupta II's newly initiated coinage types and iconography with those of the Western Ksatrapas, and the inscriptional and artistic remains of the central Indian sites of S?nci and Udayagiri which suggest that the Western Ksatrapas were finally overthrown in c. A.D. 400 during the king's reign (24). The direct transmission of Hellenistic astronomical theory from the Western Ksatrapas to the Imperial Guptas during the reign of Candragupta II is supported (23) For a complete discussion and translation of the texts relevant to the study of the planetary deities see my 'Nine Planetary Deities', pp. 167-229, 236-48. (24) J.G. Williams, The Art of Gupta India: Empire and Province, Princeton 1982, pp. 26-27. It has also been suggested on the basis of pre-Gupta numismatic evidence that a little-known vassal of the Western Ksatrapas named Sri Sarvva and his successors ruled intermittently between the two great powers and that the region was actually not conquered by the Guptas until the reign of Kum?ragupta (r. c. A.D. 415-55). See Parmeshwari Lai Gupta, 'Who Ruled in Saur?shtra After the Western Kshatrapas?', Bharatiya Vidy?, 18, 1958, pp. 83-89. Yet, as only one of the thirteen known inscriptions of Kum?ragupta mentions a military conquest (see Williams, Gupta India, p. 63), and because the subjugation of the Western Ksatrapas would certainly have been of monumental significance and therefore noteworthy, the traditional view of Candragupta II being the conqueror seems more likely. 178 [6]</page><page sequence="7">through an analysis of the development of Indian astronomy in the late 4th to early 5th century (25). Possible evidence of Candragupta II's role is also given by a literary work, which admittedly was composed considerably posterior to the date of the king. In the ]yotirvid?bharana (22:8-12), written by a 'later' K?lid?sa and probably dating from the 13th or 16th century, the legend of the 'Nine Jewels at the Court of Vikram?ditya' and the exploits of this mighty and benevolent king are narrated (26). As 'Vikram?ditya' is known to have been one of the imperial sobriquets of Candragupta II and as the story recounts the conquest of the lord of the Sakas and the city of Ujjain, the association of the two monarchs is clear (27). The significance for the theory of Candragupta II's role in the development of astronomy derives from one of the 'nine jewels' of the king being an astrologer/astronomer, his capture of Ujjain which was a center of astronomical learning, and because the text (22:17) also states that there were sixteen astrologers at Vikram?ditya's court. Although there are historical inaccuracies and the text most likely contains mythicizing embellishments of the actual accomplishments of the much earlier emperor, 'there is little reason to doubt the genuineness of the tradition that Candragupta II was a great patron of learning, including astronomy and astrology (28). Thus, it is apparent that Hellenistic astronomy was quickly accorded a distinguished regard after its introduction into India in the first few centuries of the Common Era. Rudrad?man I and Candragupta II, two highly cultivated rulers with dynamic personalities and keen interests in matters of learning, were instrumental in furthering the development of the imported science. The reigns of the two emperors who succeeded Candragupta II, Kum?ragupta I (r. c. A.D. 415-55) and Skandagupta (r. c. A.D. 455-67), were periods of great creativity and artistic accomplishments. Cultural pursuits and developments were particularly stressed under Kum?ragupta I, while the reign of the latter ruler saw a proliferation of art and architecture (29). It was apparently during this phase of artistic growth and iconographic innovation in the second half of the 5th century that representations of the planetary deities were conceived. They may even have been executed at that time, although the earliest surviving examples probably date only from the end of the century. (25) Pingree, 'Astronomy and Astrology', pp. 238-40.

[7] 179</page><page sequence="8">The Seven-Day Week The significance of the importation of Hellenistic astronomical theory for this investigation into the origin of the planetary deities lies in the fact that an additional closely allied concept was concurrently introduced and assimilated into the Indian socio-cultural complex. The Western calendrical system of the seven-day week, with its unique order and number of the days of the week, entered India from the West around the beginning of the 4th century shortly before the creation of the earliest surviving representations of the planetary deities (30). The intervening two hundred year span of time between the introduction of the seven-day week and the first images of the planetary deities would have allowed for the new calendrical system to become accepted and put into use. In addition, the 4th century was a period of comparatively meager artistic production in western India and it was not until the 5 th century that the rich Gupta artistic and iconographic creativity began to flourish (31). Contrary to the view expressed here, there is an allegedly historical incident sometimes mentioned by scholars to prove the Indian origin of the seven-day week. It involves a passage in the Life of Apollonias of Tyana (3:41:17-20) by Flavius Philostratus which states that the Indian sage Tarchas gave seven rings to Apollonius named after the seven stars, and that Apollonius wore each of these in turn on the day of the week which bore its name (32). It is generally agreed, however, that a number of historical considerations invalidate the authenticity of much of the text. As Apollonius (d. A.D. 98) lived in the second half of the 1st century A.D. and as the biographer Philostratus wrote in the early 3rd century, there is the obvious question of where the latter obtained his information. The data is purportedly from the diary of Damis, a contemporary companion of Apollonius. Numerous factual errors and quotes from classical Greek authors indicate, however, that the 'diary' was fabricated at a later date (33). Furthermore, in the context of the development of astronomy and astrology in India, the anecdote of Apollonius' planetary rings is historically anachronistic (34). (30) J.F.

Previously, the Roman calendrical consisted of an eight-day market week, known as a inundinae\ The seven-day week became increasingly common, and in A.D. 321 the Emperor Costantine (r. A.D. 306-37) officially adopted it and decreed Sunday as a day of rest {Codex ]ustiniani 3:12:2) (36). After sweeping the Western world the seven-day week travelled along the trade routes to India where it gradually gained currency (37). The date when the seven-day week entered India can be determined through an analysis of how the planets/planetary deities are grouped in the early textual passages of the astrological works written during the period of the Western Ksatrapas. In the verses of Sphujidhvaja that are dated A.D. 269-70, the planets are arranged after the Sun and Moon according to the common astrological categories of benevolent (Venus and Jupiter), neutral (Mercury), and malevolent (Mars and Saturn). Conversely, in the Vrddhayavanajdtaka, an astrological work by Minar?ja dating from c. A.D. 300-325 that borrows heavily upon the earlier text, the planets are for the first time in India listed in the temporal order of their regency over the days of the week (38). Subsequently, virtually all astrological and religious texts, but not necessarily all astronomical ones, follow the temporal order in listing the planetary deities (39). The temporal order is also invariably followed in all artistic depictions of the planetary deities. Thus, it is apparent that the seven-day week was introduced into India sometime around the beginning of the 4th century, during a period when the trade between India and Rome began to resume after the Roman wars and disruption in the 3rd century (40). Over the course of the next five hundred years after its introduction, the use of the seven-day week became increasingly prevalent throughout India until eventually it was universally adopted. It did not, however, supersede the original Indian calendar based on lunar cycles. Rather, it coexisted with the lunar calendar, which was retained for certain official proclamations and for determining the date of astrologically ordained (35) F.H.

The ponderous nature of the lunar system, which necessitates referring to such-and-such a day (tithi) of the dark or light half of the month, must have been very cumbersome for daily use. The ease of the seven-day week for everyday activities must have contributed greatly to its appeal. Both systems of marking time continue to be used today. Epigraphical evidence also corroborates the date of the introduction of the seven day week. The earliest Indian inscription that mentions an individual day of the seven-day week is located on a stone pillar at Eran in Madhya Pradesh. The inscription is dated in the year 165 in the Gupta era during the reign of Budhagupta (r. c. A.D. 477-500), which corresponds to A.D. 484. The date of the inscription is recorded as the twelfth lunar day of the bright fortnight of the month of Asadha (June July), which corresponds to 21 June. The weekday is also recorded as 'the day of Suraguru\ As Suraguru is another name for Brhaspati, the day of Thursday is indicated. Calendrical calculations confirm that 21 June 484 was a Thursday (41). The occurrence of the weekday in the inscription proves that the seven-day week was at least partially in use at this time in central India. As the next known Indian inscription to mention one of the weekdays does not date until A.D. 664, this suggests that the seven-day calendrical system was still novel (42). It is logical that the earliest inscription to mention a weekday is from Madhya Pradesh because it was in that region, and indeed at the very same site of Eran, that the first known representations of the planetary deities were sculpted (see below). After the Eran epigraph and until c. A.D. 800 when representations of the planetary deities become de rigueur on temples throughout northern India, there are at least six other known inscriptions from various regions of India that specifically mention one of the days of the week (43). Although not recognizing the significance of the inscriptions vis-?-vis the genesis of the planetary deities, the textual historian John Faithfull Fleet described the frequency distribution and importance of these inscriptions by stating: And these cases suffice to show that the assignment of the days to the planets was well enough known, by the end of the eighth century, in widely distant localities. But the number of instances is very small in comparison with the total number of records down to the same time. It is therefore plain that down to A.D. 800 there was as yet no habitual practice of citing the weekdays in dates or for other general purposes. And as a matter of fact, the inscriptions make it clear that it was not (41) The calendrical calculation was made by Sh.-B. Dikshit, cited by J.F. Fleet, Inscriptions of the Early Gupta Kings and their Successors, Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum, vol. 3, Calcutta 1888; 4th rev. ed., Varanasi 1980, p. 83. For the text and translation of the inscription see pp. 88-90 and pi. xii. (42) Fleet, 'Planetary Names', pp. 1044-45. According to Fleet, however, there are two intervening inscriptions from Champa (present-day Vietnam) that mention a weekday. (43) Ibid. Fleet also refers to an almost equal number of contemporary inscriptions from Southeast Asia and Indonesia that mention a weekday. 182 [10]</page><page sequence="11">until after A.D. 900 that the weekday became at all generally recognized as an habitual and ordinary item of the Hindu calendar (44). It is crucial to note that an analysis of the extant representations of the planetary deities indicates that it is precisely this range of dates, relative frequency, and geographical distribution that the sculptures exhibit. Roman Astrology Before discussing the artistic forms of the Indian representations of the planetary deities, a brief review of Roman astrology is necessary. Textual descriptions of Roman planetary deities, such as those found in the 4th century Matheseos Libri VIII of Firmicus Maternus and those forming the basis of the Yavanaj?taka, emphasize the divinities' personalities and their resultant influences (45). Images of the Roman planetary deities first appeared in the western realms of the empire around the last century B.C. or the 1st century of our era. Until the 4th century under the influence of Christianity, in particular Book One of Genesis that defines the Biblical order of creation, the Roman planetary deities were always listed with Saturn in the primal position. Their iconography is as follows: Saturn is represented as an old bearded man with his head veiled, holding a scythe; the Sun, in the majority of cases, is the celestial charioteer, dressed in a long chiton, his head rayed, with the whip and the globe, sometimes standing on a quadriga. The Moon [shown as a female], in a long chiton which rises sometimes as far as the head, carries a torch and a scepter [...]. Mars, in a helmet, with shield and spear, is generally nude, except for a mantle fastened on his shoulders; sometimes he has a cuirass. Mercury wears the petasos [winged hat] except where the wings are attached directly to his head; his attributes are the caduceus [winged staff] and his purse. Jupiter is bearded, with curled hair; he is nude, except for a mantle, and holds a thunderbolt and scepter and, less frequently, a spear. Venus, finally, is generally represented as looking at herself in a mirror and holding a peacock feather or a long, narrow leaf (46). As will be seen in the ensuing discussion of the Indian planetary deities, the Roman iconographic forms were completely forgone by the Indian theologians and artists. Interestingly, even the female genders of the Moon and Venus were changed to that of males, apparently in order to accord with the previously existing Vedic and Brahmanical conceptions of the divinities.

[11] 183</page><page sequence="12">The Indian Planetary Deities Although the basic religious conception and representational order of the planetary deities may have been originally inspired by Hellenistic astronomy and Roman astrology, the artistic forms and mythology associated with the divinities in India were soon Tndianized\ The iconography first used in portraying the planetary deities copied earlier Indian prototypes. Apart from that of the Sun God S?rya, the demon of eclipses R?hu, and the personification of comets Ketu, all of whom display idiosyncratic iconographic features dependent upon their mythological exploits, the inspiration for the Moon God Candra and the five conventional planetary deities was derived from figures of ascetics. These austere religious practitioners were traditionally portrayed as either seated or standing, but always wearing a dhoti and having piled and matted hair (jat?mukuta), holding the right hand at shoulder-level in the gesture of reassurance (abhayamudr?) and often carrying a rosary (aksamala), and in the left hand grasping a water vessel (kamandalu). These attributes had long been associated with various divinities, especially pan-Indic serpent deities (n?gas), Brahma and the Seven Rsis of the Hindus, and the Buddhist gods Maitreya and Avalokitesvara. In their earliest images in the first half of the 6th century, Candra and the planetary deities representing the five conventional planets were typically depicted with the ascetic and divine iconography, and were indistinguishable from one another. During the late Gupta and early medieval periods, the representations of these divinities began to exhibit greater variety. Various factors contributed to this increased iconographic complexity, such as embellishments to their separate legends, regional conceptual and stylistic differences, and the association with and iconographic influence of the presiding deities {adhidevat? and pratyadhidevatd). Representations of the Indian Planetary Deities A brief comparison between three representations of the planetary deities from different regions and periods will illustrate their artistic evolution. The first surviving images of the Indian planetary deities are from Madhya Pradesh. The earliest extant depiction of the group is found on a colossal, theriomorphic image of Var?ha, the boar incarnation of Visnu, which was erected at Eran in the Sagar district (fig. 1). The sculpture can be dated to c. A.D. 500-505 on the basis of an inscription on it stateing that it was erected in the first year of the H?na (Hun) ruler, Toram?na (r. c. A.D. 499-515) (47). On the chest of the great boar there are seven standing figures situated (47) For the traditional dates of Toram?na see Upendra Thakur, The Hunas in India, The Chowkhamba Sanskrit Studies, no. 58, Varanasi 1967, pp. 94-107; and A. Biswas, The Political History of the Hunas in India, New Delhi 1973, pp. 56-67. For a proposed slightly earlier date of his reign see Williams, Gupta India, p. 101. 184 [12]</page><page sequence="13">Fig. 1 - Detail of Seven Planetary Deities on Theriomorphic Var?ha.

The group begins on the viewer's left with S?rya who holds a lotus bud in each of his shoulder high hands and wears a knee-length lower garment. Candra and the five conventional planets/planetary deities are each shown as an ascetic with the right hand raised in the gesture of reassurance and the water vessel carried by its neck in the left hand at waist level. The planetary deities are differentiated from the surrounding sages by their different style of garments, smooth-shaven faces, and their curled locks of hair tied on the top with a small bun. R?hu and Ketu are not depicted, which follows the imported tradition found in early texts such as the Yavanaj?taka of these being only seven planetary deities. The main artistic and cultural function of representations of the planetary deities was their placement on a lintel or architrave over a temple doorway in order to help demarcate the sacrosanct threshold and to protect the temple as one of several auspicious and apotropaic motifs. One such early example was originally located on the Laksmanesvara temple in Bhubaneswar in the Puri district of Orissa (fig. 2). It [13]</page><page sequence="14">Fig. 2 - Eight Planetary Deities on Lintel. Originally from the Laksmanesvara Temple, niche on south facade. Bhubaneswar, Puri district, Orissa, India, c. A.D. 575.

A.D. 575 and is now in the Orissa State Museum (48). Eight seated divinities are depicted with their names inscribed over the lintel, which suggests that artistic representations of the planetary deities were still relatively unfamiliar at this early date and, hence, needed to be identified (49). The figures are shown in varied seating postures and their hairstyles and crowns are iconographically more complex in this relief than in the earlier example. The moon god Candra is represented with a lunar crescent behind his head. Mahgala has a distinctive hairstyle appropriated from his presiding deity, Karttikeya. Budha, Brhaspati, and Sukra have pointed tiaras over their piled hair. Sani wears what may be a smooth cap. R?hu is present, but is defaced with only his splayed coils of hair remaining. The tendency towards iconographic complexity continues in later times, with various regions of India exhibiting varying degrees of conservativeness or progressiveness in their representations of the planetary deities. The most iconographic innovation occurred in Eastern India (comprised of the present-day Indian states of Bihar and (48) For the date of the temple see T.E. Donaldson, Hindu Temple Art ofOrissa, 3 vols., Leiden 1985-87, 1, p. 31. (49) Although the inscriptions are partially effaced, the names of the following planetary deities can be read: Candra, Mahgala, Budha, Brhaspati, and Sukra. 186 [14]</page><page sequence="15">Fig. 3 - Seven Planetary Deities on Fragmentary Panel.

West Bengal, and the country of Bangladesh), where a variety of attributes were added to the visual repertoire of the planetary deities. A good example of how complex the portrayals became is a fragmentary late 11th century panel from Dinjapur in the Dinjapur district of Bangladesh now in the Burdwan University Museum (fig. 3). The iconography of the sculpture is extremely sophisticated, with not only different hairstyles, crowns, and attributes given to each deity, but even varying physiques and facial expressions as well. Certainly the most important iconographic innovations in the images of the divinities, however, were the addition of Ketu in the late 6th century and the furnishing of each deity with a mount (v?hand) and honorific attendants. Conclusion The planetary deities are among the most frequently worshipped and propitiated of all Indian divinities. Their development can be traced back to the earliest periods of Indian civilization. They have been described in numerous texts covering a wide [15] 187</page><page sequence="16">variety of subjects and portrayed in hundreds, if not thousands, of sculptures and paintings. At least two ruling patrons with strong interests in the humanities and sciences were instrumental in furthering their early academic and artistic advancement. Yet, the prime stimuli in the origin and evolution of the Indian planetary deities were the assimilation of Hellenistic astronomical theories and Roman astrology and the adoption of the Western seven-day week calendrical system. The Indians themselves were well aware of their debt to the ancient classical observers of the night sky. For as the renowned 6th century astronomer Var?hamihira expressed in quoting these words from the 1st century astrologer Garga: The Greeks [Yavanas] are barbarians, but [the] science [of astronomy] is firmly established among them; they are on this account honored equally as sages (50).
