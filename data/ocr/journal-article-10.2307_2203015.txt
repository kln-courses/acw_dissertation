<plain_text><page sequence="1">HAS INTERNATIONAL LAW FAILED THE ELEPHANT? By MichaelJ. Glennon* Are we no longer capable of respecting nature, or of defending a living beauty that has no earning power, no utility, no object except to let itself be seen from time to time? Romain Gary If, as Lao-tse said, nature is not anthropomorphic, some fellow creatures nonetheless seem to share the better angels of our character; among these animals, none is grander than the African elephant.' Elephants live in close- knit "families" of about ten members2 that seem to do just about everything synchronously-feeding, walking, resting, drinking or mud wallowing.3 Each unit has a matriarchal structure: it is headed by the oldest female and consists of younger females and their calves, as male calves tend to leave the family and strike out on their own when they reach sexual maturity between the ages of 10 and 1 54 Fighting is rare.5 Elephants are the largest land animals on earth. They grow for their entire life,6 weighing up to 6 tons7 and eating up to 300 pounds of food a day, consisting primarily of grasses and bark.8 Left alone, they can live past 60.9 They seem able to communicate with low-frequency calls that carry for 6 miles,'0 which may explain the coordinated movement and behavior of separated groups. On the same day that the culling of elephants began in Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe, elephants 90 miles away fled to the opposite corner of the reserve." * Of the Board of Editors.

They often touch each other with their trunks, and tend to stand and even walk bunched together, leaning on or rubbing each other.'2 After being apart for a while, they greet each other by inter- twining trunks, clashing tusks and flapping ears, exhibiting great excitement even if the separation has lasted for only a few days.'3 They aid other members of the group that are threatened or disabled.'4 Elephants have a haunting sense of death. When a member of the family dies, they touch the carcass gently with their trunks and feet, and cover it with loose earth and branches.'5 They do not react to the remains of other species but are fascinated by those of their own: When they come upon an elephant carcass they stop and become quiet and yet tense . . .. First they reach their trunks toward the body to smell it, and then they approach slowly and cautiously and begin to touch the bones, sometimes lifting them and turning them with their feet and tusks. They run their trunk tips along the tusks and lower jaw and feel in all the crevices and hollows in the skull [probably] trying to recognize the individual.'6 Observers noticed one 7-year-old male lingering at such a site long after the others had gone, "repeatedly feeling and stroking the jaw and turning it with his foot and trunk." It was the remains of his mother.'7 Females whose calves have died have seemed lethargic and depressed for many days after- wards.'8 When the matriarch dies, the entire family can disintegrate,'9 its former members seemingly becoming asocial and aggressive.20 Elephants have no natural enemies;2' threats come entirely from man.22 Licensed hunting continues to account for several hundred deaths per year.23 The Governments of South Africa and Zimbabwe conduct culling programs aimed at maintaining their elephant populations at a level the available habitat can support.24 As with many other species, loss of habitat to human encroachment is a major problem. Elephants and cattle compete for some of the same food, and as Africa has become increasingly agricultural, the natural range of the elephant has diminished.25 Certain native groups 12 C.

Tourist lodges in the parks have garbage pits that attract various animals, including elephants. Plastic bags and gloves, medicine bottles, broken glass, metal, wrappings and containers have all turned up in elephant dung.29 A psychiatrist has concluded that these envi- ronmental pressures may drive the elephant to increased feeding on fer- menting food: "environmental stress can be an important variable in the self-administration of alcohol [from fermented fruits and grains] in these natural habitats.' Elephants drink, perhaps, to forget . . . the anxiety pro- duced by shrinking rangeland and the competition for food. And I think that we can see a little bit of ourselves in this kind of behavior."30 By far the greatest threat to the elephant's survival is poaching. The elephant is killed for its ivory tusks, which are carved and used for dice, jewelry, trinkets, ornaments, billiard balls, piano keys and knife handles.3' A principal use is for hanko, personalized signature seals considered status symbols in Japan.2 International conservation groups estimate that the illegal killing of elephants for their ivory has reduced Africa's elephant population from 1.5 million to fewer than 500,000 in the last decade.33 By some estimates, the poachers kill two to three hundred a day;34 at this rate, the African elephant could be extinct by the end of the century.35 The New York Times compared the elephant population in 1989 for countries where there were more than 50,000 in 1979: 26 Id. at 27, 244, 272. 27 Id. at 53. 28 Id. at 78. 29 Id. at 274. 30 R.

When one holds a beautiful ivory bracelet or delicate carving in one's hand, it takes a certain leap of understanding to realize that piece of ivory came from an elephant who once walked around using its tusk for feeding, digging, poking, playing and fighting, and furthermore that the ele- phant had to be dead in order for that piece of ivory to be sitting in one's hand.39 "Every 10 minutes, another elephant is slain and its tusks wrenched or cut from its face by poachers intent on delivering, more ivory to the mar- ketplace.

In part I, I discuss why the elephant should be protected. Part II summarizes the applicable law, principally the Convention on Interna- tional Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, known as CITES.4' In part III, I analyze the shortcomings of CITES in protecting the elephant by examining the dynamics of the ivory trade and why that trade has flourished under CITES. In part IV, I consider how those shortcomings might be remedied through two approaches to elephant protection, man- agement and embargo, concluding that embargo is likely to be more effec- tive. Part IV then relates the implementation of the embargo approach to a broader framework, focusing on emerging customary norms concerning the protection of endangered species. It concludes by summarizing steps needed to protect the elephant. I. WHY PROTECT THE ELEPHANT? In 1961 Milton Friedman argued that Yellowstone National Park should be sold to private enterprise.42 If enough people wanted to preserve it as a park, he contended, they would vote with their dollars and gate receipts would dictate its continued use as a park-rather than, say, as a sour of lumber. If the public wants this kind of activity enough to pay for it, "private enterprises will have every incentive to provide such parks."43 Essentially this same argument has been made with respect to other natural resources such as wildlife.44 Why not leave the future of the elephant to the market?45 If its greater utility lies in its appeal to tourists, the argument would go, the elephant will and should be preserved by gate receipts at parks; if its greater value lies in its ivory, the ivory will be harvested. Let the market decide. The trouble with this argument, as applied to either Yellowstone or the elephant, is that it assumes a perfect market, one that will accurately meas- ure all demand for alternative uses (ivory versus protection). But the market does not accurately measure demand for protection.46 Many people who have never been to Yellowstone nonetheless want it preserved as a park and 41 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, Mar. 6, 1973, 27 UST 1087, TIAS No. 8249, 993 UNTS 243 [hereinafter CITES]. 42 M.

HITE, H. MACAULAY, J. STEP &amp; B. YANDLE, THE ECONOMICS OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY 40 (1972).</page><page sequence="6">6 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 84 are willing to pay tax dollars for its preservation merely because they like knowing Yellowstone is there. These preferences for preservation are not meas- ured by gate receipts; the market that reflects conservationist demand is not an economic market-it is a political one. In voting for or against one's congressional representative, one considers whether the representative has voted for or against preservation of Yellowstone. Similarly, tourist revenues in Africa do not accurately reflect the total demand for preservation of the elephant. Many people who have never been to Africa would wish their governments to support elephant conservation simply because they like knowing that the elephant is still there. Stated in traditional economic terms, the ivory market represents a classic case of market failure. The ivory market produces effects external to the exchange that occurs between a buyer of ivory and a poacher/seller. This ''externality" is the cost imposed upon those who prefer that the elephant remain alive-a cost comparable to that imposed upon townspeople by a factory that belches pollutants. The market in both situations fails, for the generator of the externality does not have to pay for harming others. One might object that no market failure occurs because the victims could simply bargain with the poachers (or polluters) and offer them a higher price for stopping than they could get for continuing. But-aside from practical difficulties (such as figuring out whom to pay to stop shooting elephants and how to monitor contractual compliance)47 such an approach overlooks the problem of the free rider: not all who benefit from the negotiated restric- tion will contribute.48 Private solutions thus fail.49 What is required, it be- comes evident, is a public solution-regulation.50 47 These practical difficulties or "transactional costs" can be greater than the benefits to be gained by the exchange. In such circumstances, absent government intervention, the initial allocation of resources will be final. See Calabresi, Transaction Costs, Resource Allocation and Liability Rules-A Comment, 11 J. L. &amp; ECON. 67, 67-69 (1968). 48 For a discussion of this issue, see generally E. DOLAN, TANSTAAFL*: THERE AIN'T No SUCH THING AS A FREE LUNCH 45 (1969). 4 A variant is the answer of Professor David W. Pearce: market evidence is available for these preferences only "in the highly approximate form of voluntary donations, which suffer from the usual problem that such charities are in the nature of public goods. Indeed, the main reason such donations take place is that consumers have moral as well as purely selfish motives at heart." THE VALUATION OF SOCIAL COST 24 (D. Pearce ed. 1978). Pearce also points out that the free market approach to resource allocation fails to take into account the preferences of future generations, even though they may be radically affected by current decisions, "particularly when these involve long-term or irreversible changes in the environment, for instance by depleting stocks of natural resources." Although "the views of the unborn cannot be directly taken into account," he continues, "it can hardly be disputed that those who have made a special study of long-run economic, social and environmental prospects are in a better position to represent their interests (for instance, to argue which resources are in particular need of conservation) than is the man in the street." Id. It has been forcefully argued that each generation owes a fiduciary obligation to future generations to pass on an environmentally sound planet, "in no worse condition than it receives it." See Weiss, The Planetary Trust: Conservation and Intergenerational Equity, 11 ECOLOGY L.Q. 495, 499 (1984). 50 For a useful discussion of many of these issues, see R. COOTER &amp; T. ULEN, LAW AND ECONOMICS 46, 107, 116-17, 170 (1988).</page><page sequence="7">1990] HAS INTERNATIONAL LAW FAILED THE ELEPHANT? 7 Regulation directed at protecting the elephant, however, would still as- sume the point at issue: why regulate to save the elephant? Two classes of arguments have been made for protecting wildlife in general (and various other natural resources): that it is intrinsically valuable, and that it is valuable instrumentally because of its usefulness to human beings. Many naturalists have espoused the view that nature is intrinsically valu- able because it is beautiful. According to Aldo Leopold, "A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic environment. It is wrong when it tends otherwise."'" But how does one know that something is beautiful? The notion seems implicit in Leopold's thought that one somehow discovers beauty or value that exists out there, independently of human response and without any relation to human judg- ment, valuation, use, interests or needs.52 The United Nations General Assembly seems to have adopted this view when it proclaimed in 1982 that "[e]very form of life is unique, warranting respect regardless of its worth to man."53 This approach to intrinsic value54 has been termed "aesthetic objecti- vism"-a theory that seems upon reflection to be "a refuge for knowledge claims that cannot really be substantiated."55 "The experience of natural beauty is a relative affair. It is conditioned by such things as kind and adequacy of sensory receptors, imagination, emotional temperament, con- templative capacity, age, education, knowledge of the functions of natural objects, and the aesthetic standards and tastes of society.' 56 For the same reason, other,arguments for intrinsic value seem similarly unpersuasive.57 The elephant's beauty lies in the eyes of its beholder, and its beholders come from many different cultures. Hear the outrage, for exam- ple, of Gary's Waitari, an African nationalist: Meat! It was the oldest, the most true and sincere, and the most univer- sal aspiration of humanity.. . . To the . . . black man [the elephant] always meant merely meat . . . . The idea of the "beauty" of the elephant, of the "nobility" of the elephant, was the idea of a man who had enough to eat, a man of restaurants and of two meals a day and of 58 museums of abstract art-an idea typical of a decadent society . . .. 51 A.

Whether its value can be established objectively or not, some people do derive aesthetic satisfaction from the elephant. For them, "the ontological status of aesthetic value is simply irrelevant,"62 and it is entirely legitimate for them to attempt to make the law reflect their preferences. Their argument is not that the elephant has intrinsic value, but that other widely held values, such as those reflected in humanitarian and compassionate considerations, would be bet- ter upheld by elephant preservation, or that, in effect, the elephant is in- strumental in providing aesthetic satisfaction.63 59 Id. at xvi. 60 For a provocative exchange, see T. REGAN, THE CASE FOR ANIMAL RIGHTS (1983); Professor Robert Nozick's review of the book, About Mammals and People, N.Y. Times, Nov. 27, 1983, ?7, at 1, col. 1; and Professor Regan's rejoinder, Animal Rights, N.Y. Times, Dec. 25, 1983, ?7, at 2, col. 1. As characterized by Nozick, Regan argues that mentally normal mam- mals of a year or more are comparable to mentally enfeebled human beings; they have beliefs and drives; perception, memory, and a sense of the future, including their own future; an emotional life together with feelings of pleasure and pain; preference- and welfare-interests; the ability to initiate actions in pursuit of their desires and goals; a psychophysical identity over time; and an individual welfare in the sense that their prefer- ential life fares well or ill for them. Nozick, supra, at 11. Nozick considers this description "highly overblown" and takes issue with the suggestion that a species-membership characteristic is morally irrelevant; yet he acknowl- edges that he cannot explain completely why membership in the human species does and should have moral weight. "Shouldn't only an organism's own individual characteristics mat- ter?" he asks. "Normal human beings have various capacities that we think form the basis of the respectful treatment these people are owed. How can someone's merely being a member of the same species be a reason to treat him in certain ways when he so patently lacks those very capacities?" Nozick, supra, at 1. Nozick predicts that Regan will respond that Nozick's view "will smack of 'speciesism.' " Regan does: "I fail to see how or why species membership is itself a morally decisive consideration for deciding anything, least of all which individuals have moral rights or how much value they possess." Regan, N.Y. Times, supra, at 2. "Animal rights activists," Regan concludes, "are moral activists, a part of, not apart from, such larger efforts as the human rights and environmental movements." Id. The relevance of animal rights theories to environmental ethics is not universally accepted. See, e.g., Callicott, Animal Liberation, 2 ENVTL.

Ivory production, of course, is not the elephant's only economic value. Tourism is, or could be, a key industry in many African countries with a substantial elephant population,67 and elephants are one of the principal at- tractions. Moreover, their presence helps preserve ecosystems and the species they embrace. When a keystone species68 (e.g., the elephant) in an ecological system is removed, the system can collapse as other species swell or shrink in number,69 depending on their relationship to the missing element.70 Saving the ability to identify with a given species because its characteristics are similar to our own. I do not mean to imply that species more like ourselves are entitled to greater protection than species less like ourselves. Nor, for that matter, am I prepared to defend the proposition that any one species is more worthy of protection than some other, although many of us have an intuitive sense that this may be true. These are difficult issues. See supra note 60 and accompanying text. But, according to a study by the General Accounting Office, man now extinguishes more than one species each day-and the rate could soon rise to one species per hour. Boston Globe, Jan. 30, 1989, at 28. Worldwide, the GAO report said, the planet is near a stage of extinction "unequaled since the age of the dinosaurs." Id.

THE CURRENT STATE OF THE LAW International law has developed a system, of sorts, directed at the preser- vation of species such as the African elephant. Although customary interna- tional law now requires states to protect endangered species,75 the norm has received virtually no attention, perhaps because of its acknowledged inde- terminacy in application. Rather, discussion has focused on conventional norms-specifically, those set out in CITES.76 The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora was signed in Washington, D.C., on March 6, 1973, and entered into force on July 1, 1975. By October 1989, 103 states were parties.77 CITES establishes a straightforward, three-tiered structure. Levels (1967). See also P. &amp; A. EHRLICH, supra note 61, at 96.

Export is allowed solely pursuant to permit, which is only issued, inter alia, when "a Scientific Authority of the State of export has advised that such export will not be detrimental to the survival of that species."80 The import of such specimens is allowed only pursuant to a similar permit.8' In addition, the Convention contains provisions governing the re-export of Appendix I spec- imens: a "re-export certificate" is required, which may be granted only when the re-exporting state is satisfied that the specimen was imported into that state in accordance with the Convention.82 The most restrictive provi- sions, those governing the trade in species listed in Appendix I, thus apply to producer states, middleman states and consumer states. In net effect, these provisions are intended to close down international trade in the species listed in Appendix 1.83 Appendix II provides an intermediate level of protection; it includes "all species which although not necessarily now threatened with extinction may become so unless trade in specimens of such species is subject to strict regulation."84 Thus, trade in species found in Appendix II is permitted, but regulated. The principal distinction between its regime of protection and that accorded Appendix I specimens is that, while the limitations applicable to export and re-export are similar, the limitations governing import are far less rigorous. No import permit is required with respect to Appendix II specimens, and imports for commercial purposes are allowed. Appendix II covers tens of thousands of species.85 Appendix III provides the least protection; it includes "all species which any Party identifies as being subject to regulation within its jurisdiction for the purposes of preventing or restricting exploitation."86 Limitations appli- cable to Appendix III specimens are much narrower than those pertinent to Appendix I or II specimens and derive primarily from the laws of the exporting state; unlike species listed in the first two appendixes, Appendix III species are unilaterally designated by the exporting state. 78 For a more detailed analysis of the Convention, see S.

At the 1985 meeting, the parties adopted a system directed at controlling the interna- tional trade in raw ivory, which operated as follows: [E]ach African country first sets a quota establishing the number of elephants that can be killed within its borders during the following year. All tusks and large pieces of unworked ivory taken within each country must be marked with that country's identification number. The export of those tusks or pieces must be accompanied by an export permit, and a copy of the permit must be sent to the CITES Secretariat. The Secre- tariat then tallies the number of tusks that are exported from each African country to ensure that its quota is not surpassed. Before an importing country accepts a shipment of ivory, it must first receive notification from the Secretariat that the permit is in order and that the quota has not been reached.89 Because CITES defines "specimen" as "any, readily recognizable part or derivative thereof,"90 CITES has been construed as governing only raw ivory, not worked ivory.9' One central function of the biennial meeting is to review the species listed in each appendix and to determine whether to add, delete or transfer spe- cies from one appendix to another.92 Such amendments to Appendixes I and II require the approval of a two-thirds majority of those parties present and voting.93 The amendment enters into force 90 days after the meeting.94 At the biennial CITES meeting held in October 1989 in Lausanne, the elephant was moved to Appendix I from Appendix II, where it had been listed since 1977.95 Several other CITES provisions are worth noting.

France announced that it was banning the import of ivory as of June 5, 1989.136 On the same day, President George Bush announced a ban by the United States.'37 Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan, Jr., said on June 6 that the United States (which in 1988 had imported about 12 percent of the world's raw and worked ivory'38) was imposing the moratorium on all ivory imports before the October meeting because a new review had found that there was no way to distinguish be- tween legal and illegal ivory. "We believe the current international system for controlling ivory trade has failed to protect the elephant, and we have no choice but to halt commercial ivory shipments into the United States," Secretary Lujan said.'39 On June 6, West Germany announced an immedi- ate ban.'40 And on June 9, the environment ministers of the European Community's 12 member nations voted 'to impose such a moratorium.'4' (The European Community has accounted for about 20 percent of ivory imported from Africa. 142) The senior vice president of the World Wildlife Fund thereupon declared victory: "The ivory trade has been shut down," said Curtis Bohlen.

However, a resolution was passed establishing a set of criteria, based on the African Elephant Conservation Act, that would allow a country to be removed from Appendix I if it were able to comply with the criteria. A panel of experts would be established to review an applicant's program to assess compliance. In any event, there will be no ivory quotas or commercial trade prior to the next conference in Japan in 1992. 150 Those states are South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana and Malawi.

Among the group's conclusions was that the ivory trade required much greater analysis: specifically, of how much ivory is involved, how it moves, and who benefits from it.'55 This point was underscored by David Western, Chairman of the IUCN's African Elephant and Rhino Spe- cialist Group. "We do not, at this point, understand fully how the ivory trade works," he testified. "It is an illusion to believe that we do."'156 Nonetheless, the broader contours of the trade have now emerged. 151 We know, for example, something about the principal countries of origin. In addition to Kenya, they have included Zaire, Tanzania, Botswana, Zambia and South Africa.'58 We know something about the persons engaged in poaching. In Kenya, some of the poaching has been done by Somali bandits, called shiftas, armed with modern automatic rifles. The gangs have gotten $6 a pound for tusks; a poacher can earn $100 in a single night.159 (The median income in Africa in 1988 was about $300 per year.'60) Other poachers in Kenya have been outsiders; in February 1989, an armed band of Somalian soldiers entered the country and slaughtered six 152 See infra notes 194-231 and accompanying text. 153 ECONOMIST, supra note 23, at 16. 154 D.

The Government of Kenya lodged a formal protest with the So- malian Embassy.'6' The World Wildlife Fund determined that Somalia had sold or stockpiled about 29,000 tusks from 1986 to 1989-even though the country contained fewer than 4,500 elephants in 1987.162 The President of Somalia, Mohamed Siyaad Barre, explicitly authorized the import into So- malia of raw ivory from neighboring countries.'63 Poaching has been facilitated, through inadvertence or indifference, by developers. In 1981 the Shell Oil Company constructed roads in the pre- viously isolated Selous game reserve in Tanzania. Its labor force "was not averse to poaching"; since the roads were built, elephants have declined rapidly in number.'64 Poaching has provided a source of revenue for guerrilla movements, which are well equipped to enter the business. Jonas Savimbi's UNITA, which is supported by the United States, has reportedly killed more than 100,000 elephants to finance its 14-year war against the Government of Angola. 165 We know from customs reports that an average of 800 metric tons of ivory has been leaving Africa annually.'66 But in ivory-exporting countries, the value of ivory to the export economy has rarely been greater than 1 percent.'67 Relatively little raw ivory has gone directly to the United States or other end-user countries.'68 For the most part, raw ivory has been trans- ported to entrep6ts, way stations en route to final ports where ivory is worked and its origin easily concealed.'69 Somalia, the United Arab Emirates and South Africa have been among the principal entrep6ts.'70 Burundi has ex- 161 The protest stated: "The Government of Kenya takes very great exception to this inci- dent where armed members of the Somalia National Army violate the Kenyan territorial integrity, butcher Kenya's wildlife, and open fire at Kenya security forces, injuring a number of them."

Hong Kong andJapan have been among the most prominent of such states. As controls in Hong Kong were tightened, the main carving industry appeared to be moving to Macao.'73 Japan alone has consumed close to 75 percent of Africa's raw ivory pro- duction. 174 The worked ivory has then been either sold domestically or shipped to consumer states such as the United States. The United States has imported about 30 percent of worked ivory that enters the international trade.'75 About a third of Hong Kong's worked ivory exports have been sent to the United States.'76 It has been estimated that about 80 percent of the ivory sold in the United States was obtained illegally.' 77 Why the Ivory Trade Flourished under CITES However incomplete our current picture of the international ivory trade, it nonetheless seems fair to conclude that throughout the 1980s, the trade boomed despite the CITES protective regime for a fairly obvious reason: CITES did not sufficiently diminish the incentives of producers, middlemen or consumers. Producer states faced a variety of problems. The vast profits available from poaching, or merely looking the other way, made the corruption of enforcement personnel a recurrent difficulty.'78 Game wardens, The Econo- mist observed, "can make more from a couple of contraband tusks than they do in a year's honest work. Fat profits made government officials fairly easy to suborn."' 79 Grinding poverty, as noted above, also has played a major role.'80 171 C. Moss, supra note 2, at 299. The CITES Secretariat estimates that in 1986 at least 300 tons of ivory left Africa illegally, much of it from Burundi via the United Arab Emirates for Singapore.

Their game wardens frequently were overwhelmed by the poachers' fire- power,'81 to the extent that Kenya-a nation that has come to take wildlife conservation seriously-asked Britain for helicopter gunships, spotter planes, transports and automatic weapons for its new, paramilitary Anti- Poaching Unit.'82 By one estimate, the cost of surveillance, fencing and support equipment needed to halt poaching entirely in Kenya's Tsavo Na- tional Park was $200 per square mile per day-which worked out to $1.6 million a day.'83 Producer states seemed little affected by the quota system they established under CITES. The system has been entirely voluntary and had no binding effect on the parties. Consequently, if a producer state exceeded its quota or even declined to supply a quota to the CITES Secretariat, other CITES parties had no legal basis under CITES for refusing entry to that producer state's ivory.'84 Moreover, the quotas have been based on ridiculously high estimates of sustainable yields provided by the producing countries.'85 "The quota system," the World Wildlife Fund concluded, "has proved to be little more than a procedure for ivory-producing states to notify the CITES Sec- retariat of the number of tusks they plan to export in a given year. "186 Entrepot states thrived on the ivory trade under CITES. Burundi, which was not a party to CITES until 1987, and the United Arab Emirates, the only state to sign CITES and then withdraw,'87 operated free of constraints. 188 As conservationist pressures increased, individual middlemen stored raw ivory within Africa in the hope that those pressures would someday ease.'89 It is interesting to compare these income statistics with those of countries that have con- ducted more successful elephant conservation programs.

There is no requirement in CITES that worked ivory be identified by coun- try of origin when imported. Consequently, the worked ivory trade has not been controlled;190 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has not required that the country of origin be declared.'91 In the past, this loophole has been exploited by intermediary countries that are parties to the Convention to avoid the CITES restrictions on raw ivory. "Traders in Hong Kong, for example, imported ivory from Dubai, a free-trade zone in the United Arab Emirates, where the tusks were superficially carved. This allowed Hong Kong traders to import 'ivory artwork' from Dubai . . 192 A report by the United Nations Environment Programme observed: "Already ivory carvers are being moved to places such as the United Arab Emirates, Dubai and Taiwan-where there are few import controls on even raw ivory-so that the partly worked products can then be freely imported into the major centers.

Whether it will do so as a result of the changes made in Lausanne is problematic, for reasons that will be discussed next. IV. MAKING CITES WORK Two Models of Protection: Management and Embargo When the Lausanne Conference began, two very different models of wildlife protection were competing for acceptance. The two approaches had earlier split the conservation community'94 and set southern Africa against East Africa.'95 One I will call the "embargo" model; the other, the "man- agement" model.

Its proponents reasoned that the more legal ivory is traded, the easier it will be for poachers to place illegal ivory into the trade stream. "By keeping the ivory trade going," one expert said, "there is no question that illegal trading will go on."' 96 Kenyan President Moi, a leader of the proembargo forces, thus set fire to 2,500 ivory tusks, worth $3 million:'97 "We could sell the ivory, and use the money for conservation," his conservation minister said, "but we believe that that is only fueling the market."''98 The management model would attempt to limit and control the ivory trade, rather than banning it altogether. Proponents of management would permit the sale of ivory from several sources: (1) supplies of confiscated poached ivory; (2) elephants that die a "natural death"; and (3) culling operations in states where elephant populations exceed the available habitat. They argued that such ivory is best placed on the market to provide rev- enues for stricter enforcement efforts. A ban would simply drive the trade underground and propel- the price of ivory ever upwards. Thus, ivory should be marketed to relieve supply pressures created by the black mar- ket.'99 Moreover, management proponents contended, the people in these (largely) underdeveloped countries should not be left to starve while con- vertible "white gold" was being accumulated by their governments. In good part, therefore, each model defined itself in terms of the short- comings of the other. The embargo model insisted that the purely "legal" ivory trade presupposed by the management model was fanciful. The con- tinuing lawful supply of ivory, its adherents contended, would enable poachers to hide illegal ivory, which can be mixed with the legal and ren- dered indistinguishable.200 Underpinning the management model, on the other hand, was the argument that the termination of ivory trading presup- posed by the embargo model was fanciful. The continuing demand for ivory-lawful or unlawful-its adherents contended, would lure poachers into meeting that demand. Which model is valid? Each proceeds from principles of economic theory that render its conclusions entirely plausible. That those conclusions are mirror images derives from differing answers to an empirical question: can the ivory trade be substantially ended? Because the issue is empirical, it may be illuminated by examining international efforts to limit or control trade in 196 N.Y. Times, June 22, 1989, at A8 (comment of Richard E. Leakey). 197 Wash.

To the extent that the trade in these other substances resembles the ivory trade, the successes and failures of those efforts will be instructive. Perhaps the substance that leaps first to mind is cocaine. That the effort to close down the international trade in cocaine has thus far failed dismally is a proposition that need hardly be elaborated. What is of interest is how the cocaine trade compares with the ivory trade. Are efforts to apply an em- bargo to the ivory trade likely to fare as poorly? At first blush, the similarities between the cocaine and ivory trades seem apparent.20' Each is demand-driven. Eliminate demand, one may think, and the trade in both will end. Permit demand to continue, and supply will continue. Suppress supply, one may suppose, and price will increase, which, in turn, will increase supply-coca growing and ivory poaching. Increase supply, and price will drop.202 Yet there are several crucial differences. First, whereas the potential supply of ivory is largely inelastic, at least at present, the potential supply of coca is not. Deregulation of the ivory trade would thus increase the price by rapidly depleting the supply; deregulation of the international cocaine trade would deflate the price of cocaine by increasing supply.203 Second, the objective of enforcement is the opposite in the two trades. Cocaine enforce- ment aims at eliminating the supply by eradicating or severely limiting the source (coca), but enforcement designed to close down the ivory trade aspires to preserve its source-elephants. The effect of these differing ob- jectives suffuses the relationship between the supply and demand of each substance and skews other possible parallels. Consequently, the failure to suppress the cocaine trade is not instructive; the dynamics of that trade are simply too different. Efforts to eradicate the trade in other contraband substances also invite comparison, but there, too, parallels are inexact and analogies suspect. The trade in stolen art, for example, seems beguilingly similar. Professor Paul Bator, discussing the international trade in looted art, noted that finding a domestic deterrent is "especially acute in societies where the administration 201 In fact, wildlife smugglers not infrequently smuggle narcotics as well. S. FITZGERALD, supra note 64, at 19. 202 This is in fact what has occurred in the international cocaine trade. From 1985 to 1989, worldwide coca production has increased by 50%, from 162,700 metric tons to 229,990 metric tons. The supply glut is reflected in plummeting prices: in 1980, the wholesale price of cocaine was $50,000-$55,000 per kilogram; by 1988, the price hit an all-time low of $10,000- $12,000.

However, as the supply of ivory dropped over recent months, contrary to some predictions, its price actually declined-perhaps because demand dropped even faster.

Much the same can be said of ivory poachers. Detection is difficult, and until then, there is no one to complain; and "[e]ven when there is complaint, the harm is often not widely appreciated . .."204 The suppression of a lawful supply can drive a certain amount of supply underground: "The harder it is to obtain objects within that category legally, the more intense the demand to acquire them on the black market."205 And as the embargo on exports becomes more effective, "the number of purchasers willing to deal illegally and the amount of funds available on the illegal market also increases."206 Yet raw ivory, unlike many art objects, is fungible, creating different enforcement problems-and possibilities. A stolen art object, for example, can sometimes be identified and confiscated; a piece of worked ivory made from a poached tusk normally cannot be. A potential buyer of ivory can be made aware through mass educational efforts that the substance was proba- bly taken unlawfully; generalized publicity campaigns are rarely possible with respect to stolen art objects. Hence, like the drug trade, the trade in stolen art seems not altogether parallel. The international trade in other contraband substances is also too dissimi- lar on the whole to permit reliable analogy.207 That applies equally to trade in a substance from a species often compared to the elephant in conserva- tionist debates: the black rhinoceros. The specter of the black rhino has loomed like a dark spirit over the debate on how to save the elephant.208 A ban on trade in its horn was put in place when it was moved to Appendix I in 1983, yet the animal has been hunted to virtual extinction.209 In 1970 there were 70,000 black rhinos; in 1988, 3,800.2 10 This dismal precedent is perhaps the most frequently made argument of proponents of the management model for the elephant. It was relied upon by South Africa in arguing against the ban.211 Yet there are significant differences between the trade in ivory and the trade in rhino horn.212 Elephant tusks sell for much less than the highly 204 Bator, An Essay on the Initernational Trade in Art, 34 STAN.

Rhino horn is transported much more easily; because of its mythic medicinal properties, it can be ground into powder and fitted into covert containers. Ivory is much harder to hide (even an uncut rhino horn measures only 2 feet in length). All in all, the embargo approach to protecting the elephant seems highly unlikely to cause it to suffer the tragic fate of the black rhino. A more apposite analogy-in fact, probably the precedent most on point -can be made with the leopard.218 Once mercilessly overhunted, leopards have recovered splendidly219 since placement on CITES Appendix 1.220 In large part, that recovery has been brought about by a broad-gauged educa- tional campaign undertaken by nongovernmental conservation organiza- tions. The campaign largely succeeded, to the extent that it has now become socially unacceptable to wear a leopard-skin coat.221 The ivory campaign is directed at similarly educable people, many of whom were previously igno- rant of the threat to the species and would gladly forgo purchasing deriva- tives to help save it. (In contrast, the publics in Yemen and various Asian countries continue to regard a rhino-horn dagger handle as a status symbol.) The matter is not free from doubt, but the most reasonable conclusion is that the elephant would be better protected by the embargo approach than by the management approach. The management model works best in pro- tecting nonendangered or formerly endangered animals, such as the Ameri- can alligator and beaver, under a "sustainable use" regime.222 Earlier argu- ments against a prophylactic ban on ivory trading were more plausible when developed countries would have had to initiate the ban over African oppo- sition.

It gave this reason: "It is very doubtful that legal trade of ivory stocks could be accomplished without provid- ing cover for illegal trade."225 That position was correct then, and it is correct now.226 Nevertheless, that is not the solution that emerged from Lausanne. The solution that did emerge is a hybrid of the two models, and therein lies its defect. Although in principle a listing under Appendix I represents a CITES endorsement of the embargo model with respect to a certain species, in reality no bona fide embargo is put in place since CITES permits parties to enter reservations.227 Thus, under the post-Lausanne CITES regime, not- withstanding the elephant's Appendix I listing, it remains legal for ivory- producing states to sell ivory, and six have indicated their intent to do so228- even though a majority of the CITES parties recognized that termi- nation of the trade is essential to protecting the elephant and major con- sumer states have agreed to ban imports. The legality of continued ivory sales does not preclude nontrading states from attempting to compel trading states to stop. Such legislation-has been introduced in the United States Congress and is directed at both pro- ducer229 and consumer230 states.

It must be made clear-multilaterally, if possible; unilat- erally, if necessary-that all ivory trading is impermissible; so long as any trade is permitted, the embargo will be eviscerated because the legal trade will simply draw ivory poached from areas where herds are endangered. As Zambia's tourism minister put it in endorsing the ban, it will be useless unless it includes all the nations involved.23' Carrots as well as sticks are available to the international community to produce the desired order. Indeed, when considered in the context of a comprehensive structure of global environmental resources, rights and ob- ligations, the primary tools for compliance clearly ought to be incentives rather than disincentives. Global Environmental Resources, Rights and Obligations If the embargo model is to be preferred over the management model as the optimal approach to elephant protection, it does not follow that ivory- producing states should themselves absorb the cost of such programs or, for that matter, that "elephant-excess" states should themselves shoulder the opportunity cost of forgoing the sale of ivpry from culling operations or confiscation. The equitable allocation of costs should be a function of the actual distribution of benefits. This principle, in a nutshell, animates the notion of global environmental resources, rights and obligations. Ali Hassan Mwinyi, President of Tanzania, succinctly alluded to these concepts in a recent speech: "That Tanzania has a rich wildlife resource is an accident of geography. It belongs to all mankind. The international community should therefore contribute to its survival."232 These ideas are not new; their elements, in one form or another, pervade the recent literature on international environmental preservation.233 Nor are they limited to leaders of the Third World.

In this new world of freedom the world citizens must enjoy this common trust for generations to come."234 Yet it was not long ago that the international system placed far greater emphasis on national sovereignty over natural resources than on global interdependence. As recently as 1972, states were thought to have absolute control over all natural resources located within their boundaries. Principle 21 of the Stockholm Declaration on the Human Environment provided that "States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources."235 Less-developed countries were particularly vigorous in as- serting "permanent sovereignty over natural resources" and a correlative right to dispose of resources fully and freely.236 Even the new Restatement of Foreign Relations Law cautiously limits its discussion of international environ- mental law to transfrontier pollution.237 Since 1972, however, so many states have adopted laws directed at pre- serving their environment that it probably is no longer correct to think that states have unlimited authority to injure the environment in any manner so long as the injury is restricted to their own territory.238 States also have bound themselves increasingly by treaty to protect unique international treasures.23' The UN General Assembly, in the 1982 World Charter for Nature, affirmed general principles of conservation to which "[a]ll areas of the earth" are subject.240 Professor David Caron criticized the narrow ap- proach of the Restatement and summed up emerging thought as follows: [A]s humanity believes increasingly that in a theoretical sense the planet belongs to all . . . , the notion of legitimate interests seems to extend far beyond traditional notions of harm. Consequently, there is a per- ception that all have an interest in preventing the loss of a species, the destruction of cultural heritage, and the waste of natural resources.241 234 N.Y.

International law has been moving steadily to protect wider humanitarian interests and to prevent environmental degradation, even at the cost of eroding state sovereignty. Where once states were seen to have carte blanche to do what they would to persons within their own territory,244 later they were viewed as owing certain obligations to aliens, and now they are thought to owe such obligations to their own nationals as well.245 Where once states were free to pollute the "global commons" and the oceans, today they are enjoined against injuring unoccupied islands, ice floes and Antarc- tica;246 and they are obliged to prevent injury to the marine environment by pollution247 and to protect global wetlands.248 Indeed, as early as 1974, the UNEP Council viewed certain species as constituting "the common heritage of mankind."249 It is now possible to conclude that customary international law requires states to take appropriate steps to protect endangered species. Customary norms are created by state practice "followed by them from a sense of legal obligation."250 Like highly codified humanitarian law norms that have come to bind even states that are not parties to the instruments promulgating them,251 wildlife protection norms also have become binding on nonparties as customary law. Closely related to this process of norm creation by practice is that of norm creation by convention: customary norms are created by international agreements "when such agreements are intended for adher- ence by states generally and are in fact widely accepted."252 Several such 242 O.

It is intended for adherence by states generally254 and is accepted by the 103 states that have become parties. In addition, some nonparties comply with certain CITES documentary requirements so as to trade with parties.255 CITES is not "rejected by a significant number of states";256 only the United Arab Emirates has withdrawn from the agreement. In such circumstances, the International Court of Justice has observed, international agreements constitute state practice and represent law for nonparties.257 Moreover, customary norms are created by "the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations."258 Because CITES requires domestic im- plementation by parties to it,259 and because the overall level of compliance seems quite high,260 the general principles embodied in states' domestic endangered species laws may be relied upon as another source of customary law.261 Even apart from the CITES requirements, states that lack laws pro- tecting endangered species seem now to be the clear exception rather than the rule.262 That there exists opinio juris as to the binding character of this obligation263 is suggested by the firm support given endangered species 253 See, e.g., Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, supra note 248; Conven- tion Relative to the Preservation of Flora and Fauna in their Natural State, Nov. 8, 1933, 172 LNTS 241; International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, Dec. 2, 1946, 62 Stat. 1716, TIAS No. 1849, 161 UNTS 72; International Convention for the Protection of Birds, Oct. 18, 1950, 638 UNTS 186.

To the extent that the norm derives from CITES and laws implementing CITES, that scope would be fairly narrow, for the norm would cover only species in international trade, not those taken for domestic consumption or those endangered by threats to their habitat. Even if it could be shown that major legal systems generally comprise endangered species legislation, more work needs to be done to determine exactly what elements those laws have in common.265 What constitutes an "endangered species," for example, is debatable. Is it one that is endangered in every state, or only in the state making the assess- ment? And to what lengths must a state go in protecting a species it finds "endangered"? Must it do everything necessary to protect that species, notwithstanding the cost or the ecological significance of the species?266 As to the elephant in particular, it is hard to argue under customary international law that states such as South Africa and Zimbabwe are prohib- ited from selling ivory by a new customary norm, corresponding generally to the CITES restrictions. In the North Sea Continental Shelf case, the Interna- tional Court of Justice said: Although the passage of only a short period of time is not necessarily, or of itself, a bar to the formation of a new rule of customary international law on the basis of what was originally a purely conventional rule, an indispensable requirement would be that within the period in question, short though it might be, State practice, including that of States whose interests are specially affected, should have been both extensive and virtually uniform in the sense of the provision invoked . . .267 The nonparticipation of southern African states suggests that any such custom is not "virtually uniform."

Ordi- narily, claims for the violation of an international obligation may be made only by the state to which the obligation is owed.271 Obligations erga omnes, however, run to the international community as a whole; thus, their breach is actionable by any state since such matters are "[b]y their very nature . the concern of all States. . . .

This development accords with long-standing principles of American jurisprudence that have viewed certain things that lack traditional property status as nonetheless generating property-like ex- 28 pectations. 84 Indeed, a powerful case has been made for regarding natural objects themselves as having legal rights.285 Influenced by Professor Stone's ground-breaking essay,286 three Supreme Court Justices in Sierra Club v. Morton endorsed that approach.287 These considerations suggest the outline of a general framework for the protection of endangered species under customary international law. Al- though such principles may still represent lexfrrenda with regard to a partic- ular species (or other resource), they appear to constitute emerging opinio juris on a broader structure of global environmental resources, rights and obligations that might be summarized as follows. A global environmental resource is a natural resource located within the territory of one country but broadly enjoyed, and arguably needed, by the world community as a whole. Tropical rain forests, described as the "lungs of the world" by Indonesian President Suharto,288 are a good example. Unique cultural artifacts are another. That these exist within specific states is largely an accident of geography; but for their presence, the life of all would be diminished. For the reasons outlined in this article, and in light of the tremendous worldwide concern generated recently over its possible extinction, the elephant seems properly regarded as a global environmental resource. A global environmental right arises in connection with a global environmen- tal resource. It refers to the right of all states to expect that the resource will be protected by the state in which it is found. States are trustees, responsible for the preservation of species within their territories. That obligation runs to the international community as a whole: any state should be regarded as suffering legally cognizable injury when that obligation is breached by an- other state. That states have a global environmental right to expect that the 280 Lacoste v.

There are two tiers of such obliga- tions: custodial obligations, which refer to the preservation duties of states in which the resource is physically located; and support obligations, which refer to the duties of other states to contribute to the conduct of custodial obliga- tions. First World states often complain about the failure of Third World states to meet their custodial obligations (concerning, for example, their elephant populations, rain forests and archaeological treasures), but few of the complainers have met their support obligations. The Economist put it well: "Logically, if the rest of the world wants the elephant to survive, then it should not only compensate Africa for $60 million of lost exports, but help to foot the bill-of perhaps $80m-$100m-for an effective war on poachers."291 The point bears elaboration. Support obligations are appropriately seen as applying to two sets of costs incurred by ivory-producing states: the opportunity cost of forgoing the sale of ivory from natural elephant deaths and confiscated poached ivory, as well as the cost of running conservation programs. East African states such as Tanzania and Kenya should not be forced to shoulder the entire burden of running conservation programs themselves. All who benefit from elephant protection should share the cost. As the international system is structured, they do so indirectly, through assistance by their governments. Such assistance ought to be provided through an international authority able to administer and oversee an aid program to African states. UNEP, which is headquartered in Nairobi, seems to be the logical existing vehicle. Assumption of this task would entail something of a change of mission and restructuring for UNEP, which was conceived of more as a coordinating/monitoring agency than as an executive/adminis- trative one.292 Until a multilateral approach can be instituted, unilateral assistance is appropriate, perhaps in the innovative form of "debt swaps." Debt swaps involve monetary concessions by lenders in exchange for enhanced resource management by borrower states that are unable to keep current on debt payments. Much of the attention paid to the idea has derived from concern 289 See supra text at notes 240-80. 290 Reuters (July 3, 1989). 291 ECONOMIST, supra note 23, at 17. 292 See generally Robinson, Introduction: Emerging International Environmental Law, 17 STAN.

Conservation International, for example, arranged to have Bolivia's external debt reduced by $650,000 in exchange for that country's protection of 3.7 million acres of Amazonian forest.293 Costa Rica has also received debt reduction in return for setting aside certain tracts of land from development.294 Senator Joseph Biden proposed a plan to pay off the foreign debt of cocaine-producing countries in South America if they would fund crop substitution and eradication programs.295 "In the long run," Biden said, "the best way to cut coca production is to provide economic incentives to grow other crops."296 The same approach can be employed to further wildlife conservation in less-developed countries. Recently, in fact, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) arranged with Madagascar to buy $2.1 million of debt in return for expend- itures of local currency on several conservation projects, including an addi- tional four hundred park rangers.297 WWF also signed a debt-for-nature swap with Zambia under which WWF purchased $2.27 million of debt owed by Zambia to commercial banks in return for the Government's agreement to expend an equivalent amount in local currency on conservation, includ- ing protection of the rhino and elephant.298 There is no reason for nongov- ernmental organizations or lending institutions to bear the burden; they should be reimbursed through initiatives by the public sector.299 One of the major such initiatives was taken by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1990. The Global Environmental Protection Act, included in the bill, would have authorized the Agency for International Development to award grants to private con- servation groups to purchase a country's commercial debt on the open market, usually at a highly discounted price, and offer the debt to the host government in exchange for a long-term financial or policy commitment to 300 support a particular project. It is also appropriate for the international community to reimburse "ele- phant-excess" states such as Botswana and Zimbabwe for the cost of not selling ivory, if they were persuaded to do so. After all, revenues from the export of ivory help pay for conservation programs30' (as was noted by the CITES Secretariat in opposing the effort to move the elephant to Ap- pendix 1302). 293 See Spitler, Exchanging Debt for Conservation, 37 BIOSCIENCE 781 (1987). 294 What Can Americans Do.2, TIME, Sept. 18, 1989, at 85; Arias Sanchez, For the Globe's Sake, Debt Relief, N.Y.

Professor David Pearce of the University of London's Environmental Economics Center has calculated that Western donors would have to give Africa up to $100 million in aid a year to compensate for lost revenue and to help governments strengthen anti- poaching patrols.303 Others suggest that the cost may be less. Professor David Favre, on the other hand, has written that in South Africa, from 1967 to 1989, the total retail value of the illicit ivory sold at auction to the local carving industry came to only $2 million.304 One thing is clear, however: if live elephants really have a greater value than dead ones, "the world's consumers have the money to prove it." Steps to Saving the Elephant In sum, unless the elephant is to continue down the road of the black rhino, a number of steps must be taken. 1. The ivory trade must be stopped immediately. As discussed above, halting the ivory trade requires effective steps to dry up both supply and demand and to cut out middlemen. Kenya's President Moi put it well: "To stop the poacher, the trader must also be stopped and to stop the trader, the final buyer must be convinced not to buy ivory."305 States that do not comply with the international ban must be appropriately pressured into doing so, at least until the elephant is safe and an internationally controlled ivory-mark- ing system is in place. 2. Antipoaching squads and other enforcement units must be strengthened. We ought not to be deluded into believing that domestic enforcement of the criminal law in producer countries can easily be tightened up. Corruption among law enforcement authorities is not unknown in those countries where the elephant is most threatened. This problem was exemplified by a operations and confiscation, producer states would lose significant revenues which could oth- erwise be used to finance anti-poaching and enforcement operations." Letter from Eugene Lapointe, Secretary-General, CITES, to all CITES Management Authorities (June 8, 1989) (on file with author). It has been reported that from 1985 to 1989, the CITES Secretariat has received $200,000 from ivory traders, including at least one alleged poacher. Thornton, supra note 157, at 8. 303 Reuters (une 19, 1989). This figure includes the cost of buying off ivory traders, paying game park wardens more so they do not poach, buying and maintaining vehicles for patrols, and equipping personnel properly. Pearce, Britain's leading environmental economist, argues that we should value not only assets that are generally recognized as such-property, machin- ery, roads, housing-but also environmental assets such as clean water, clean air, forests, wetlands, wildlife, the ozone layer, even natural beauty. We may not pay for these assets, but the cost of replacing them is so high that it is vital to value them correctly. See Daily Telegraph (London), Aug. 16, 1989, at 13.

The am- bassador, Joesoef Hussein, was caught trying to leave Dar es Salaam with 184 elephant tusks stowed in his luggage. He apparently expected no prob- lem and claimed diplomatic immunity. Rather than asking the Indonesian Government for a waiver so that Tanzania could prosecute, the local gov- ernment officials reportedly tried to cover up the incident.306 Even when there is a will to succeed, it is hard to take seriously a commit- ment to elephant conservation that sends game wardens armed with pre- World War I carbines against poachers using machine guns.307 A multilat- eral entity such as the CITES Secretariat or UNEP should undertake to arrange appropriate assistance. If that means some form of paramilitary or police training-or operational, down-in-the-trenches participation-that agency ought to be empowered to call upon appropriate countries to help, much as the Security Council may call upon members of the United Nations when military units are needed.308 The objective should be "united interna- tional police action to eliminate the illegal ivory trade."309 3. Environmentally sustainable development must be supported as an essential prerequisite to elephant protection. The elephant simply will not be safe as long as unlawful conduct pays so much more than lawful conduct. In the long term, enhanced law enforcement can only be a stopgap measure unless economic incentives to poach are greatly reduced.310 This is true even though, in the short run, development and conservation can conflict at times. A principal means of development in have-not countries, for exam- ple, is agriculturalization, but agriculturalization deprives the elephant of its habitat; funds spent to build a dam are not available to buy spotter planes for game wardens. At a certain point, therefore, some weighing of the value of development relative to that of elephant protection remains unavoidable in determining how many elephant populations to protect, and at what price. The questions that arise here are difficult and timeless. Above all, development is directed at the preservation and enrichment of human life.31' It is easy for Ameri- 306 His excellency the ivory smuggler, NEW AFRICAN, April 1989, at 13.

An internationally operated ivory-marking system using the latest technology should be instituted. Recent advances in the science of wildlife forensics have been impressive.315 It is now possible not only to identify ivory by species of origin,316 but also to mark ivory tusks so that parts of lawfully taken tusks are subsequently identifiable-easily and inexpensively.317 In fact, secretly marked ivory is already in the stream of international commerce. The integ- rity of a tagging system depends upon that of the officials who operate it;318 if they are corrupt and accept bribes to mark poached ivory, or if they permit the tagging technology to fall into the hands of poachers, the system loses its reliability. For this reason, international control at this point seems essential. If it eventually proves desirable to move from the embargo model to a management model-that is, if the elephant someday gets "back on its feet" in countries where it is now threatened319-such a system could oper- ate in the following way: An international authority such as UNEP or the 312 Zimbabwe officials called the drive for a ban on ivory trade "cultural imperialism" by outsiders. Chicago Trib., July 9, 1989, at 21. One Zambian wildlife manager, referring to Western conservationists, said: "The dimension they forget is that of people." Reuters (July 9, 1989). 313 In one of the more innovative programs aimed at generating local support for conserva- tion, the Government of Kenya charged a "bed fee" for each bed used by a tourist in Amboseli lodges. The fee was passed on to the Masai, who in return agreed to move out of the elephant's watering areas. May, Preservation for Profit, N.Y. Times, Sept. 12, 1987, ?6 (Magazine), at 146.

The governments of those countries could then bring ivory, up to the amount permitted in their quota, to the marking authority's clearinghouse for tagging. Certain aspects would have to be public to avoid bribes and corruption, but the tagging itself would have to be conducted privately to keep the technology confidential. A comprehen- sive and enforceable marking system could not be put in place immedi- ately;320 however, the upshot is that modern science seems finally to have eliminated the problem most responsible for the elephant's decline: the indistinguishability of lawfully and unlawfully taken ivory. 5. A long-term solution requires several modifications of CITES. First, the CITES restrictions must be made applicable to worked, as well as raw, ivory. Middlemen, not producing states, have skimmed off the bulk of the profits of the ivory trade.32' They are able to do so in good part because CITES effectively carves out a role for them: inasmuch as CITES does not apply to the trade in worked ivory,322 it provides an incentive for "working" illegal tusks superficially so as to remove them from the CITES constraints. This incentive can and should be eliminated by the parties; indeed, the Conven- tion itself already points the way. Article I(b)(3) provides for the express listing of "specified parts and derivatives" of already listed animals. A reso- lution was adopted at the first special session of the parties in Geneva that would have created a minimum list of readily recognizable parts and deriva- tives.323 However, no such list has been drawn up, in part because of con- cern that it would be a "maximum," rather than a "minimum," list.324 This concern, while perhaps valid at the time, seems to have been overtaken by events at Lausanne and should now give way to countervailing consider- ations-namely, that the failure to produce a "parts and derivatives" list has contributed mightily to the undoing of CITES. The parties should draw up a list, formalizing what was left implicit at Lausanne, and worked ivory should be on it. This step is essential for another reason. The agility of middlemen at leapfrogging new restrictions has often been noted, though it takes little prescience to predict their next line of attack. If CITES continues to be 320 It is possible to determine the date on which an individual elephant was killed within a period of plus-or-minus 2 years. This means that only a 4-year age window can be ascertained with respect to any unmarked tusk. Consequently, under current technology, a marking system that is initiated in, say, 1992 would not provide effective enforcement possibilities until 1996, since unmarked ivory taken before 1992 could not be said with certainty to have been poached. 321 1988 House Hearings, supra note 114, at 166 (testimony of William K.

There is evidence, in fact, that this movement has already begun.325 Some might applaud the establishment of carving facilities in producer countries; the economic boost would be welcome and some of the proceeds, at least theoretically, could be put to the best use in conserving remaining elephant populations. Yet, in the end, the move would only prolong the ivory trade and continue to threaten a species that CITES now officially views as "threatened with extinction."326 If the values sought to be vindicated by CITES are to be protected effectively, its application to the international trade in worked ivory is imperative. Second, CITES must be further modified to permit the provisional listing of a species on Appendix I, and a new, broader treaty must be negotiated that is not tied to commerce. Because no such provisional listing is possible, the international system not only has failed the elephant, but also has inad- vertently accelerated the killing of elephants. The flurry of unilateral bans on ivory importation announced by various governments in June 1989 derived from a justifiable concern that movement of the elephant to Ap- pendix I by the CITES parties meeting in Lausanne the following October would result in an "orgy" of killing,327 as poachers anticipated tighter inter- national controls. CITES provides no mechanism by which an international entity (such as the CITES Secretariat) can promulgate a provisional ban subject to subsequent approval by a conference of the parties.328 It may be that some parties would not delegate this much authority to the secretariat, at least as currently constituted. It may also be that the process of settling upon a provisional listing would itself generate anticipated killing; a meas- ure of confidentiality would be required that could prove difficult to achieve. Yet without such a procedure, any public effort to move a highly visible species up to Appendix I to prevent poaching-and virtually every effort to do so will be public because international publicity generates the necessary support-is almost guaranteed, in the short term, to bring about more killing of the species, not less. If the elephant is safer today than it was a year ago,329 thanks are due to the individual governments that banned 325 1988 House Hearings, supra note 114, at 163 (testimony of William K.

Further lessons about CITES taught by the elephant's plight can be gener- alized only to a point. Some species are threatened by poachers.330 Others face threats apart from poaching, most often loss of habitat.33' The short- comings of CITES that so hurt the elephant have little application to the difficulties those species confront. Yet the very inaptness of CITES to their prQblems is perhaps the most damning criticism of all: CITES does not even seek to protect those species, since its only concern is with endangerment posed by international trade. It is time for a new, worldwide treaty that broadly safeguards endangered species irrespective of commerce.332 6. The broad-based educational campaign already successfully undertaken by nongovernmental organizations must be continued. It is not enough to educate buyers of ivory to the horrors of its origins. Ultimately, protection of the elephant and other endangered species will require a change in mind set by both individuals and governmental institutions that have viewed concern about animals with a certain derision. Robert Nozick began his review of Thomas Regan's book with the following observations: "Animal rights seems a topic for cranks. Who else would devote major energy to promote changes in our treatment of animals or write a book on the subject?"333 Past failures by the United States to pay its dues to organizations such as CITES, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said, "have called into question its commitment to these agreements."334 When the committee added a provi- sion to the Foreign Relations Authorization bill for fiscal year 1990335 strengthening protection of the elephant,336 the Washington Post chided the importation of endangered species or their products in one nation will not protect such species if other states increase their imports of such products by an equivalent amount."

There are still some of us who refuse to despair, to throw up the sponge and go over to the other species for solace. There are men fighting and dying at this very mo- ment, in the streets, on the barricades and in the prisons . . . . One may still be allowed to prefer to take an interest in them.338 That sentiment may lie behind the Post's belittlement of concern about the elephant's impending demise: there are more important causes, human causes, worth fighting for; to ignore those causes out of concern for the elephant is, if not to "go over" to their side, at least to demonstrate a fixation with the peripheral, the marginal, the "small"-to imply in some cranky way that the two species are somehow equally worthy of protection. The responses to these criticisms made by characters in The Roots of Heaven are still persuasive. One is LaurenSot's: "But the elephants are part of that fight. Men are dying to preserve a certain splendor of life. Call it freedom, or dignity. . . . They are dying to preserve a certain natural splendor."339 Another is Father Fargue's: "Perhaps the lepers and the peo- ple with sleeping sickness aren't the whole story."340 But perhaps the best, for those concerned about wasting energy on nonhuman suffering, is that of Morel: "Today you say that elephants are archaic and cumbersome, that they interfere with roads and telegraph poles, and tomorrow you'll begin to say that human rights too are obsolete and cumbersome, that they interfere with progress . .

Even if this is not a struggle to ensure our own survival, it is a battle to clarify our character, to define what we hold dear, for ourselves and our descendants.342 It is the character of our species that is at issue.
