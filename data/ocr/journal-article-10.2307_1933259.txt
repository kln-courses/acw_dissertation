<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SOCIAL BEHAVIOR OF THE HERRING GULL1 The aim of this book, according to the author (p. xvi), is not to give an exhaustive treatise of Herring Gull sociology, but rather to attempt a sketch of the prob- lems as he now sees them. Most of the many facts con- tained in this useful book have been published before in various articles and other books by Tinbergen, and are here brought together in convenient form to give some- thing of an over-all picture of the life of one species of bird. The method of study consisted primarily of field ob- servation with binoculars by a more or less hidden ob- server, and was often supplemented by field experiments. Individual birds were recognized by plumage peculiarities and other cues; during one year 14 gulls were also given colored leg-bands. The author names ten students and field companions who have aided him in tle field work over the years. The main substance of the book is a detailed and the- oretical analysis of reproductive behavior in the Herring Gull (Larus argentatus). Many aspects of the different postures involved are illustrated by line drawings often taken from films, and by a series of magnificent photo- graphs. In sequence Tinbergen describes and analyzes 1 Tinbergen, Niko. 1953. The Herring Gull's World. A study of the social behaviour of birds. xvi + 255 pp., 58 figs., 30 plates.

The detailed table of contents seems to suffice as a sub- j ect index. The book has an index to authors and to species of birds and other animals mentioned in the text. There is a bibliography of six pages, and the literature citation, admittedly incomplete, leaves some important gaps. For example, thlere is no mention of any of the variotus published reports on the endocrine control of breeding behavior in gulls. Near the end of the book there is a chapter on "Sign stimuli in other animals" that seems somewhat irrevelant. The style of presentation generally is clear, interesting, logical, keenly imaginative, and basically obj ective. The author emphasizes (p. 156) the importance of avoiding anthropomorphic terms in the description of a bird's behavior. The adult Herring Gull has a red spot on each side of the lower mandible, and the function of this red spot seems to be to stimulate and direct the feeding responses of the recently hatched chick. By an ingenious series of models the author and his students have gathered evi-</page><page sequence="2">372 REVIEWS Ecology, Vol. 36, No. 2 dence that color, background contrast, position, and movement of this spot are all important elements in stimulating the chick to peck at the beak of the parent and thus be guided to the food which is normally held in the beak when the parent feeds its young. This series of experiments represents the climax and most original contribution of the book, and provides one of the best analyzed examples we have at present showing the func- tion of any type of bird coloration. However, even this case does not seem entirely satis- factory. The results are presented in graphical form showing the number of pecking responses to the models with no indication as to number of individual chicks in- volved for each test. In none of the tests, as described in this book or in the published articles on which it is based, were statistical tests of significance applied to any of the differences secured. Furthermore, although one may have confidence in the skill and impartiality of the experi- menters, the latter themselves gathered evidence to show that not only movement, but also lowness, nearness, and the angle at which the model of the parent's beak is held are important in stimulating the pecking reactions of the chick. These are all conditions conceivably liable to sub-conscious and subjective influence during successive presentation of hand-held models. In general, the evi- dence which is reported in this book in support of vari- ous conclusions is presented in a plausible and logical manner, but this evidence often needs to be strengthened and amplified to be thoroughly convincing. This is not to ignore the stimulating value of the theoretical frame- work and its value for further research. Indeed, the author seems to be well aware of present limitations of the study. This book is apparently in- tended as a progress report for the general reader, and the statement is made in the concluding chapter that "The main result of our Herring Gull work therefore is not to be found in the conclusions drawn, but rather in the sharper formulation of the problems." It is encouraging to know that both in Europe and America, various students are taking up the study of other species of gulls and terns. Not the least of Tin- bergen's contributions to animal sociology has been the inspiration he has afforded to students interested in the behavior of animals under natural conditions. NICHOILAS E.
