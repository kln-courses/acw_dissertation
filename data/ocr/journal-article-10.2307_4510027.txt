The setting is a beaver pond, the day is the fall equinox, and the chief event that affects every one is the break- ing of the dam through the crashing down of the Osprey's dead cottonwood in the storm. The characters are a beaver, a mink, an otter, a Varying Hare, a moose; an Osprey, American Merganser and Trumpeter Swan; a trout, a frog, and even a leech, a snail, a mosquito and a scud. Miss Carrighar weaves her story skillfully; she enters into the life of each of these very different animals and without anthropomorphism depicts the interplay of instinct and learning. It is a fascinating narrative and one that adds to our knowledge and widens our sympathies. George and Patritia Mattson add much to the interest of the book with their spirited drawings.-M. M. Nice. 70. Canadian Spring. Florence Page Jacques. Illustrated by Frances Lee Jacques. 1947. Harpers. New York. 216 pp. $3.50. Another treasure of a book from the Jacques. In her vivid, inimitable style Mrs. Jacques tells of their great journey (largely by automobile, partly by railroad) to Canada in April 1946, first to watch waterfowl at Delta on Lake Manitoba, then west across the prairies to the National Parks in the Canadian Rockies, and finally north to Fort St. John and Hudson Hope in British Columbia, with the return journey to Delta in June. It is an enthralling narrative with wonderful descriptions-the Whistling Swans and Ruddy Ducks and WAestern Grebes, the antelope and Mule Deer, the mountains and pines and wild flowers. Mr. Jacques' sketches give the finishing touch of perfection. In her fine closing chapter the author writes: "I had loved this earth of ours as deeply as I was capable of loving it, and I felt content, holding close what I had received in return: a clear assurance of unquenchable life and joy." We, too, can have high adventure.-M. M. Nice. 71. Spring in Washington. Louis J. Halle, Jr. 1947. Wm. Sloane Asso- ciates. New York. 227 pp. $3.75. Our National Capital with its wild Rock Creek Park, the Potomac, Mount Vernon and the old canal at Georgetown is a wonderful place for those who have eyes to see and ears to hear. The transfor- mation in the birds and plants traced from the first song of the Cardinal on January 22, 1945 to the sight of the last migrating Blackpoll Warbler on June 8. "Spring in Washington" is an inspiration with its keen, discriminating observa- tion of birds and trees, its fine style, and its philosophy based on fundamental values in life. It is a joy to look at with the distinguished sketches of Mr. Jacques that accurately portray the scenes described. The spectacular changes of the seasons in this favored spot are vividly and beautifully told by Mr. Halle; his book brings us awareness of the marvel of awakening life each spring.-M. M. Nice.
