<plain_text><page sequence="1">American Philosophical Quarterly Volume 13, Number 3, July 1976 II. THE DREAM ARGUMENT RONALD SUTER THE dream argument goes back at least as far as the time of Plato. We find it in the Theaetetus, as part of Plato's refutation of the view that knowledge is perception. Theaetetus agrees with Socrates that what appears to a dreamer is not real. He claims that "dreamers believe what is false... [for example, when they] think they have wings and are flying in their sleep." Consequently, perception in a dream is not knowledge. But (he continues) none of us can be sure that any of his perceptions are not dream perceptions. At least Theaetetus says he cannot "see by what evidence it is to be proved [whether we are asleep or awake, dreaming all that passes through our minds or talking to one another in the waking state], for the conditions correspond in every circumstance like exact counterparts." Socrates apparently accepts Theaetetus' conclusion that we cannot be cer? tain that we are not dreaming.1 To my know? ledge Plato nowhere attempts to refute this argument. It is interesting to note that roughly a genera? tion later, about the time of Aristotle, Chuang Tzu, the great Chinese Taoist, also expresses doubts about whether we can ever be certain that we are awake. "Perhaps you and I are dreaming," he writes, "and have not wakened."2 He rightly contends that while we dream "we do not know that we are dreaming," even if we dream that we are dreaming. "Only after we are awake do we know we have dreamed" (Ibid., p. 189). But since there seems to be no certain way of telling whether we are awake, we can never know when we have dreamed. Chuang Tzu illustrates the difficulty: "Once I, Chuang Chou (this was his private name), dreamed that I was a butterfly and was happy as a butterfly. I was conscious that I was quite pleased with myself, but I did not know that I was Chou. Suddenly I awoke, and there I was, visibly Chou. I do not know whether it was Chou dreaming that he was a butterfly or the butterfly dreaming that it was Chou" (Ibid., p. 190). These two examples show that the dream argument goes back to ancient times and was taken seriously by major philosophers in both the East and the West. Descartes' version of the argument, which is probably the most famous, serves a new purpose in showing that a particu? lar class of perceptual judgments is not in? dubitable, but the argument remains basically the same. In his First Meditation, Descartes inquires whether there are any philosophical reasons to doubt perceptual judgments of the form "I see (hear, feel) so and so," where the so and so is something physical, nearby, and easy to perceive. He has already concluded that he cannot trust such judgments if the so and so is "hardly per? ceptible or very far away," since his senses have sometimes deceived him about such matters.3 At first he is tempted to respond in the manner of G. E. Moore: Surely these hands and this body are mine and I am here, seated by the fire, attired in a dressing gown, with these papers be? fore me. One must be insane to doubt such matters, or at least it seems only madmen do in fact have doubts of this kind. Unlike Moore, however, Descartes quickly sub? dues the temptation to admit perceptual judg? ments of nearby physical objects as indubitable. Speaking now with more metaphysical rigor, Descartes introduces his dream argument. He contends that possibly he is only dreaming that he is perceiving a fire, attired in a dressing gown, and the like. Not only could this happen, but he claims that it has happened to him and indeed that "on many occasions I have in sleep been deceived by similar illusions." Descartes justifies his present doubt, then, by observing that "mani? festly ... there are no certain indications by i85 1 The Collected Dialogues of Plato, edited by Edith Hamilton and Huntington Cairns (Princeton, 1961), Theaetetus ir?h-d. 2 A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy, translated and compiled by Wing-tsit Chan (Indianapolis, 1963), p. 200. 3 The Philosophical Works of Descartes, tr. by E. S. Haldane and G. R. Ross (New York, 1955), I, 145.</page><page sequence="2">l86 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY which we may clearly distinguish wakefulness from sleep." The experience of seeing a real fire is not clearly distinguishable from dreaming that one is seeing a fire. Generalizing, one can be in one and the same qualitatively indistinguishable perceptual state whether one is dreaming or one is awake. The conviction about what one is per? ceiving is therefore inconclusive, and there al? ways exists the possibility that one is mistaken about the matter?even if the perceptions seem to be of a nearby physical object which is easy to perceive. Descartes thus concludes that pos? sibly he is asleep and "neither our hands nor our whole body are such as they appear to us to be" (Ibid., p. 146). I. Two Answers Which Will Not Do Before presenting a refutation of the dream argument I want to discuss two unacceptable answers to it. The first tries to defeat the argu? ment by establishing that one is awake and not dreaming on the basis of some sort of evidence. The second tries to defeat the dream argument with an argument from contrast or from cor? relative terms. 1. A necessary premiss of the dream argument is that there is no evidence one can appeal to, at time t, to establish whether one is awake or dreaming at time t. Theaetetus and Descartes make the premiss explicit; it seems to be im? plicit in Chuang Tzu. One of the most common responses to the dream argument is to contend that this premiss is false. Such a response is un? successful. Consider a Humean who proposes to dispute the premiss on the grounds that we have an in? ternal criterion of the difference between im? pressions and ideas. He may quote with approval Hume's remark that impressions and ideas differ in "the degrees of force and liveliness with which they strike upon the mind."4 This may tempt him to conclude that we have the follow? ing test to determine whether one is awake or dreaming at any given time: all one need do is check the vivacity of one's perception; if one's perception is, say, of a fire and the perception is vivid and has a great deal of force and liveliness, then one can be sure that one is not dreaming that one is perceiving a fire; one really is per? ceiving it and hence one is awake. This approach to the problem, however, fails to appreciate the force of the skeptic's counter that it is possible to have dreams which have much "force and vivacity." This is obviously possible, since if any waking experience has a certain quality, one can always dream that one has an experience which has that very same quality. Thus Hume's internal evidence is inconclusive. Hume himself implied as much when he observed on the second page of his Treatise: "in sleep... our ideas may approach to our impressions.. . [and] it sometimes happens, that our impressions are so faint and low, that we cannot distinguish them from our ideas." Appeal to the vivacity of one's perceptions cannot settle the question as to whether one's perceptions are waking or dream perceptions for another reason as well. If it is uncertain whether one is now dreaming, then, if one is consistent, it ought to also be un? certain whether one is now applying the test to one's perceptions or only dreaming that one is doing so. But dreaming that one is applying a test is not applying a test. Accordingly, it cannot be certain that one has even applied the Humean test, much less passed it. In his book Dreaming, Malcolm shows that the last objection also applies to the use of any coherence principle to find out whether one is awake or dreaming.5 Several eminent philo? sophers?e.g., Descartes, Leibniz, Pascal, Russell, Ayer?have thought that the way to answer the question is to employ a criterion of coherence, consistency or agreement. Descartes, for example, makes use of such a criterion in his Sixth Medi? tation. Roughly, the test is: if the perceptions cohere with one another, one is awake; if they fail to cohere, they are dream perceptions. For instance, if my memory can connect the percep? tions one with the other, or with the whole course of my life, I am not dreaming. But, again, there is the objection that incoherence, while characteristic of many dreams, is no more essen? tial to dreams than is a lack of vivacity. A second decisive objection to such a test is that it is always possible to dream that one is remember? ing the connection of one perception with another or with the whole course of one's life. 4 David Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature, edited by L. A. Selby-Bigge (Oxford, 1958), Book I, Part I, Section I, p. 1. 5 Norman Malcolm, Dreaming (New York, 1959), p. 108.</page><page sequence="3">THE DREAM ARGUMENT 187 That is to say, it is possible to dream that one's perceptions cohere; hence reliance on coherence settles nothing. The point may be generalized: no test can get us out of such a doubt, for it is always possible to merely dream that one has applied the test which shows one's perceptions to be veridical. In his reply to Malcolm, Ayer shows he does not appreciate the force of this last objection. For he writes that it is a mistake to think that the coherence test is worthless just because it is inconclusive.6 A test can be useful even if in? conclusive. The general point may be accepted. But Ayer fails to see that if we genuinely doubt whether we are now awake or only dreaming, then we must also doubt whether we have just now applied or only dreamed that we applied our test. Accordingly, neither the coherence nor any other test can get us out of the doubt. No matter what the test, we always confront the same difficulty: assuming an acceptance of the initial doubt, we must, if we are consistent, also doubt whether we have carried out the test. Hence Ayer cannot conclude that his "test" provides him with even an inconclusive reason to cease ques? tioning whether he is awake or dreaming. We do not conclude on the basis of any argument that it is highly probable that we are awake and not dreaming. Indeed, if we begin by doubting whether we are awake?if this is accepted as a genuine doubt?no appeal to any tests or evi? dence will ever make it more probable, or in? ductively support, that we are awake rather than dreaming. The point is nicely illustrated in the following passage from "The Poet," the last of Isak Dinesen's Seven Gothic Tales: "Listen, Madame Fransine," he said, "I dreamed of you two nights ago." At this she smiled, but was much interested. "I dreamed," he said, "that you and I were walking to a great seashore, where a strong wind was blowing. You said to me: 'This is to go on forever.' But I said that we were only dreaming. 'Oh, no, you must not think that,' you said. 'Now, if I take off my new bonnet and throw it into the sea, will you believe that it is no dream?' So you untied your bonnet and threw it from you, and the waves carried it far away. Still I thought that it was a dream. 'Oh, how ignorant you are,' you said, 'but if I take off my silk shawl and throw it away, you must see that all this is real.' You threw back your silk shawl, and from the sand the wind lifted it and carried it off. But I could not help thinking that it was a dream. 'If I cut off my left hand,' you said, 'will you be con? vinced?' You had a pair of scissors in the pocket of your frock. You held up your left hand, just as if it had been a rose, and cut it off. And with that?" He stopped, very pale. "With that I woke up," he said.7 I conclude that Theaetetus is quite right: there is no non-question-begging way one can tell that one is now awake and not dreaming. Let me mention two provisos at this point to prevent a possible misunderstanding. First, I am not denying that there are differences between dreams and waking experiences. In dreams physically impossible, absurd?and even logi? cally impossible?things can happen. In a dream a human being can turn into a butterfly or be identical with a chandelier. Wives can change their husbands into giant pastrami sandwiches. With hot mustard. Woody Allen recounts how in a dream his laughter turned to tears and "then into a serious ear infection."8 In dreams it is possible at one and the same time to be a corpse in a coffin and be identical with a person who is not in the coffin. (Professor Isak Borg had such a dream in Ingmar Bergman's Wild Straw? berries.) I say it is possible to dream such things, because if someone on awakening sincerely re? ports that he did, we all accept that that is what he dreamt. That is, we accept sincere or truthful dream reports as true regardless of their content. Note a distinction here. I am not saying that "I dreamt that p" and "It is not the case that I dreamt that p" can both be true. They cannot both be true, since they contradict each other. What I am saying is that reports of the form "I dreamt that p and not-p," or those which are reducible to this form, can be true and will be true if reported sincerely or truthfully. Such re? ports are not self-contradictory, even though what follows the words "I dreamt" is self contradictory or is reducible to a formal self contradiction. Contrast now our reaction to sincere reports of waking experiences. We do not always accept them as true. Indeed, we shall insist that they are not true if we think the experiences 6 A. J. Ayer, "Professor Malcolm on Dreams," The lournal of Philosophy, vol. 57 (i960), p. 533. 7 Isak Dinesen, Seven Gothic Tales (New York, 1961), pp. 402-403. 8 Woody Allen, Getting Even (New York, 1972), p. 68.</page><page sequence="4">l88 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY described could not have happened or if we think the descriptions of them are self-contra? dictory. If someone reports that yesterday he had an exciting conversation with a logician who happened to be, literally, a caterpillar or that he got his fifth divorce after being married only twice, we know the reports could not be literally true. Accordingly, if someone believes that he did something and that he did not merely dream that he did it, if he becomes persuaded that such things never happen or are impossible, he now has reason for thinking that he may have dreamt it. Thus one may believe that as a child one visited a fabulous city constructed only of emeralds in which everything appeared green. Later, upon reflection, one may become con? vinced that the quantity of emerald required to make such a city was too vast to be real: hence one may come to believe that one only dreamt that one visited such a city. This later conviction may or may not be correct. I have mentioned a few specific ways in which dreams and dream reports can differ from wak? ing experiences and reports of waking experi? ences. From this it of course does not follow that physically impossible, absurd, or logically im? possible things must occur in dreams. As noted, dream occurrences may be very plausible, co? herent, logical. Hence the absence of absurdity and the occurrence of what is logically possible does not guarantee that the experience is a wak? ing one and not a dream experience. Yet the difference cited helps to explain how appeal to evidence may show that one did not dream some? thing one thought one dreamt. If one is awake at time t2, one may at that time gather evidence supporting the conclusion that one dreamt that a particular thing happened at some earlier time tv In such cases it is legitimate to talk about gathering inductive evidence. Indeed, the evi? dence will be inductive in the sense of being inconclusive. For even if such an event could not have happened, it does not follow that one dreamt that it happened. One may have read about it or it may even have been an halluci? nation. There may still linger a temptation to think that if what I said is true, while there is indeed no evidence one can appeal to, at time t, to prove that one is awake at time t, there is a way of proving, at time t, that one is dreaming at that time: all one need observe is that what is ap? parently occurring is absurd or logically or scientifically impossible. But that won't help, as Chuang Tzu recognized, for if one is in doubt whether one is dreaming, one must also doubt that one is observing something. 2. I want now to show that a simple contrast or correlative argument also fails to defeat the dream argument. This kind of argument goes as follows: It cannot be that we are always dream? ing, for "dreaming" and "not dreaming" are correlative terms. If the first is meaningful, the other must be too, and vice versa. Hence the first applies to something only if the second does, and conversely. Put more generally, if "F(a)" makes sense, it cannot be the case that "(Vx) F(x)." (Compare Butler's short answer to the psychological hedonist.) There are several reasons why this argument fails. First, even if one accepts it, it gives one no assurance that one is not now dreaming. All it concludes is that we are not always dreaming. Indeed, the last conclusion is compatible with one person's always dreaming. So the argument will not get Descartes out of his skeptical doubt. Finally, the argument involves a nonsequitur. Even accepting its first premiss that "F" is meaningful if and only if "not-F" is meaningful, it does not follow that "F" applies to anything, in the sense of being true of it, if and only if "not-F" applies to something, in the sense of being true of that thing. Hence the argument does not even succeed in showing that we are not always dreaming. II. The Dream Argument Gives Rise to a Dilemma My first objection to the dream argument takes the form of a dilemma. The argument seems to force one to choose between two equally unacceptable alternatives. First, if we accept the extreme doubt that we are not now perceiving this table, on the grounds that possibly we are now dreaming, by parity of reasoning we must also doubt whether we understand the words we are using to express our alleged doubt. After all, it is no less an empirical fact that particular words mean what they do rather than something else or that they are used in such and such ways rather than in other ways. Moreover, such facts are no more certain than the fact that I now see a table. If I therefore profess uncertainty about the latter, because I might only be dreaming, surely I ought to claim to be uncertain about</page><page sequence="5">THE DREAM ARGUMENT 189 the meaning of these words as well.9 Perhaps these words are meaningless or express something quite different from what I take them to express. Thus if Descartes is consistent, his professed doubt should defeat itself by making him doubt his very doubt. It might be objected that the skeptic can go on doubting that he is awake on this first alterna? tive, since all that has been shown is that he must do his doubting silently and without using words.10 I will not try to settle the question as to whether one can think and doubt without using language. But even supposing this to be possible, to doubt that one is awake and not dreaming one must at least have the concept or idea of dream? ing and of being awake. But it is no less an empirical question whether a person does or does not have such concepts. Thus if I can doubt that I am now awake, how can I consistently refrain from doubting that I have the requisite concepts to entertain such a doubt? Maybe I am only dreaming that I have such concepts. But dream? ing that I have a concept is not having that concept; nor does it imply that I have it: I may or may not. Consequently, if I now doubt?even silently and nonlinguistically?that I am awake, if I am consistent, I will go on to doubt that my silent doubt is a genuine doubt. So the first alternative again leads to a destruction of one's initial doubt. I am assuming here the principle that if I doubt that p, then I cannot doubt that I doubt that p, or, if anyone sincerely was un? certain that he had a particular doubt, we would conclude that he did not have that particular doubt. We know that Descartes' initial doubt was not quite so hyperbolical as I am claiming it should have been. He never went on to doubt his own doubt. Instead, he took for granted that he understood what it was he doubted, that he knew what it was to doubt, to know, think, exist, and the like. He wrongly and inconsistently thought he could doubt whether he perceived his hands, his body, the papers in front of him, and yet that he could avoid doubting whether the word "hand" had the particular meaning which he thought it had. Thus he did not push his alleged doubt far enough. Had he, he would have seen that it was equally doubtful whether he was even entertaining the doubt he thought he was. That too might only be part of a dream. Accordingly, he should have thrown out his so called initial doubt as itself doubtful. Put in a word, the first alternative points out that the professed doubt which the dream argument gives rise to is self-defeating. Finally, it seems to lead to an infinite regress of doubts, each one of which undermines the doubt that preceded it. At any given moment we may be left with some doubt, but in the next breath we will destroy it as well. I turn now to the second alternative. If we grant that Descartes understands the relevant words and possesses the concepts needed to ex? press his doubt that he is awake, consistency will require that he admit that he has no such doubt after all. Accordingly, the second alterna? tive returns us to the common sense view that there is no doubt that we are awake, which contradicts one of the conclusions of the dream argument. To see this let us grant that the pro? ponent of the dream argument understands the meaning of words like "hand" and "blue". Then he will know that it is correct to say of things such as my hand, "That is a hand," and of a blue color, "This is blue." In short, if we allow Descartes to have language and to understand the meaning of his words and to have certain concepts?and we have seen he must have such understanding if he is to entertain his initial doubt?then it will follow that he will be able to make many correct and true judgments which belie that he doubts that he is awake or that he doubts that he is now perceiving some nearby physical object. (I am of course not saying or implying that if he understands these words he will never be hesitant to apply them to what he sees nor that he will never make perceptual errors. But he will only hesitate to judge a thing to be a hand, say, if he has some special reason to think that what looks like a hand really is not a hand.) It is for this reason that Wittgen? stein says: "If I make certain false statements, it becomes uncertain whether I understand [those statements]" (C81). Or putting it positively, in some cases: "The truth of my statements is the 9 Ludwig Wittgenstein, On Certainty, ed. by G. E. M. Anscombe and G. H. von Wright and translated by Denis Paul and G. E. M. Anscombe (New York, 1969), makes a very similar point in section 456. Hereafter all section refer? ences to this work will be preceded by a "C" and appear in parentheses in the body of the paper. 10 I owe this objection to Keith Muntyan and Gary Supanich.</page><page sequence="6">IQO AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY test of my understanding of these statements" (C8o). For example, if I understand the word "table," I will recognize that what I see before me is a table, or I will recognize the truth of the statement "What I see before me is a table," assuming I am now in a normal state, the illumination is adequate, and the like. This, incidentally, helps explain why Wittgenstein writes: "I am not more certain of the meaning of my words than I am of certain judgments" (Ci*6). There is a possible reply Descartes could make at this point, though I do not want to deal with it here. He might concede: I admit I am now perceiving a hand. There is a sense in which I never did doubt this. I never did doubt it practically; I only doubted it metaphysically. A counter to this could involve trying to under? mine his distinction between metaphysical and practical doubt. The distinction seems a phony one. But to return to the dilemma. We saw that Descartes' dream argument forces its proponent to choose between two equally unacceptable alternatives. On the one hand, there is the first alternative: If we doubt the truth of all of our perceptual judgments because we may now be dreaming, we must doubt that we understand what it is to doubt such matters or any others; so accepting our doubt we must doubt it, which undermines our initial doubt. On the other hand, there is the second alternative: If it is beyond doubt that we understand the conclusion of this dream argument and that we possess the relevant concepts to entertain the doubts to which it leads us, consistency will require that we abandon our doubt that we can never be certain of the truth of our perceptual judgments along with our doubt that we are now awake. On the basis of these considerations we ought to reject Descartes' dream argument. III. A Reductio ad Absurdum of the Dream Argument My second objection to the dream argument takes the form of a brief reductio. If we accept the argument, we must, if we are consistent, doubt everything. Anything and everything be comes subject to doubt for the reasons already given in the last section. Accordingly, the argu? ment leads to complete skepticism. But, as Wittgenstein observes, "a doubt that doubted everything would not be a doubt" (C450). This is because "the game of doubting itself pre? supposes certainty" (C115). Thus Descartes' doubt that he is awake rests on his certainty that he once dreamt that he was sitting in front of his fireplace, attired in his dressing gown, and the like. Hence, "a doubt without an end is not even a doubt" (C625). I take Wittgenstein to be making a conceptual point here: the concept of doubt is parasitic on that of belief. Doubt pre? supposes belief, because one always needs grounds or reasons for doubt (see C122); that is, the doubt of p must rest on the belief that some q. It follows that complete or total skepticism is an incoherent notion. Since the dream argument implies total skepticism, the dream argument must be rejected. IV. The Question "Am I Now Dreaming (Literally)?" is Senseless My third and final objection to the dream argument is directed at the meaningfulness of the so-called philosophical question "Am I now dreaming?" This alleged question assumes that either I am now dreaming or I am not now dreaming: the questioner wants to know which it is. My contention, put very roughly, is that "I am now dreaming" is senseless. (I shall qualify this claim shortly.) Hence the disjunction "Either I am now dreaming or I am not now dreaming" is also senseless. Here I am employ? ing a principle endorsed by Hempel and others, viz., that if a sentence "S" is without sense, then "Either S or not S" is also without sense.11 I conclude that the question must also be senseless. Strictly speaking, however, it is not correct to say "I am now dreaming" is senseless. What I mean to say is that it is senseless unless it is used in certain ways. The first person present tense of the verb "to dream" has various uses. "I dream" may be used to inform someone that one does dream. "I am dreaming" is sometimes also used as an expression of surprise or amazement. Thus a colleague told me he thought he was 11 Carl Hempel writes in Aspects of Scientific Explanation (New York, 1965), p. 102: "If under a given criterion of cognitive significance, a sentence N is non-significant, then so must be . . . any disjunction N v S, no matter whether S is significant under the given criterion or not."</page><page sequence="7">THE DREAM ARGUMENT I9I dreaming when late one night he saw a neighbor of his apparently watering his lawn with a hose in the middle of winter. (He found out later the neighbor was preparing an ice skating rink.) "I am dreaming" may function as an exclama? tion like "My God!" "I'm dreaming!" or "I must be dreaming! "?perhaps millions of Americans uttered such words when they heard that Nixon fired Archibald Cox. The first person present tense may be used metaphorically as well, viz., as hyperbole. If one day one woke up in Tahiti, saw the sun rising out of the ocean, the fishermen pushing their boats into the surf, and one were surrounded by incredibly beauti? ful people who informed one that one was now the ruler of their island, one might wax ex? travagant and say "I'm dreaming." The locution "I dream of..." in turn functions to express a desire or wish. We can imagine a rubber fetishist saying to his psychiatrist "I dream of Jeannie in a rubber bikini wearing rubber longjohns and a rubber raincoat." Were Martin Luther King to remark "I dream of a time when all men will be brothers," we would know he is expressing an ideal as well as a hope and a wish. Similarly, if Stravinsky says "I dream of creating new forms of music," we take this to be the expression of a wish or longing. Finally, we sometimes say "I am dreaming again" or "I'm dreaming; I can't afford that," when this is elliptical for, roughly, "I am imagining things" or "I'm being un? realistic." I believe that in all of these uses of "I am dreaming" the speaker could go on to assert: "Well, I'm going to sleep now," which shows very clearly that he never for a moment thought that he was claiming, literally, that he was now dreaming, for that would imply that he already was asleep. (Notice: I am not dis? cussing day-dreaming in this paper.) We have seen the ways in which "I am dream? ing" can be used and suggested ways in which "Am I dreaming?" might be used. We can imagine occasions on which these words can be meaningfully uttered and we can paraphrase, at least roughly, what would be conveyed by them. So it is certainly reasonable to hold that the sentences are meaningful. They are meaningful because they can be used in these different ways. Suppose, however, that someone uttered these sentences and that he denied that he meant them to be taken in any of these standard ways. We would be hopelessly bewildered. We would perhaps admit that what he said sounded okay and that it was grammatically well-formed, but that we could not understand it since the speaker rejected all of the standard interpretations. Eventually I believe we would conclude?and I think rightly?that the person had lapsed into nonsense. This brings me back to my main point: When the philosopher asks "Am I dreaming?" he does not mean it in any of the ways suggested. Nor does he use "I am dreaming" in any of the ways we have allowed as legitimate. For these reasons, as well as those given earlier, I conclude that his question is senseless. I know what I am saying is likely to be dis? puted. So I shall try to anticipate some possible objections.12 Objection i. The following "unassailable proof" may be offered to show that "I am dreaming" is meaningful when used by the philosopher: i. The negation or denial of every true sen? tence is meaningful and false.13 2. Every sentence which is false is meaning? ful.14 3. The sentence "I am not now dreaming" is true, where "I" is understood to refer to me now. 4. Therefore, if I say "I am now dreaming" it is false. (By 1, 3.) 5. Therefore, if I say now "I am dreaming" what I say is meaningful, whether or not I mean it in any of the ways mentioned above. (By 2, 4.) Reply. The first premiss is ambiguous and may 12 Most of these objections arose in my seminar in epistemology which was given during the winter of 1974. I am especially appreciative to Allan M. Hart for the very clear criticisms which he directed at this third reply to the dream argument. 13 Israel Scheffler, in The Anatomy of Inquiry (New York, 1963), p. 134, says the "denials of significant sentences must themselves be significant." He writes: "Take any [true or false and hence] significant sentence and form its denial. This denial must, then, again be true or false?false if the original sentence was true, and true if the original sentence chosen was false. Thus, this denial must ... be significant since all true or false sentences are significant." u Ibid. On p. 159 Scheffler makes a stronger and more dubious claim from which premiss 2 follows: "For every sen? tence 5, S is true or false if, and only if, S is significant."</page><page sequence="8">192 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY be taken in either of two ways, both of which must be rejected. We may take it as claiming, first, that if any true sentence is prefaced with the words "It is not the case that," or some synonymous expression, the resulting sentence will be false and meaningful. Secondly, we may take it as claiming that every statement has a negation in the sense of a denial, namely some? thing which counts as an action of negating it. If we reflect on the sentences "I am not dead," "I am conscious," and even perhaps "It's not the case that I believe falsely that Michigan has little sunshine," I think we will see that the first premiss is false, on either interpretation. For the statements made with these sentences do not have negations, in the sense of denials, i.e., any? thing which counts as an action of negating them. Moreover, the sentences "I am dead," "I am unconscious," and "I believe falsely that Michigan has little sunshine" are not both false and meaningful, though I grant that "I am dead" is meaningful in much the same sort of way "I am dreaming" is meaningful. Other criticisms could be made of this argument, but this suffices to refute objection 1. Objection 2. We can literally ascribe dreaming to others in the present tense by saying "He (or she) is dreaming." Therefore, I must grant that the sentence "I am dreaming" can also literally ascribe dreaming to me. Taking "dreaming" as a one-place predicate and "he," "she," and "I" as terms which refer to individuals, we may be tempted to say that "He (or she) is dreaming" is meaningful if and only if "I am dreaming" is meaningful and that the predicate must be able to function in the same way in both cases. Reply. The objection involves at least two mistakes. First, as Strawson has pointed out in his article "On Referring" one should not speak of "I," "he," and "she" referring to particular persons; rather, it is we who refer to particular persons using such referring expressions. Secondly and more importantly, the objection contains a non-sequitur. For it is not even the case that if something of the form "He is F" is meaningful, then "I am F" must also be mean? ingful, much less mean in the same way. Proof by counter example: "He believes falsely," "He is dead," "He is unconscious," these are all meaningful statements. Yet it is nonsense to say "I believe falsely (am dead or am unconscious)." Objection 5. But if while I am dreaming I say "I am dreaming," I say what I might say later of myself, viz., "I was dreaming," or I say what another person says if he says of me "He's dreaming." I make the same assertion, affirm the same proposition. Hence it must have the same truth-value. A fortiori, it has a truth-value and it is meaningful for me to literally ascribe dream? ing to myself. Reply. What is being overlooked here is that when I utter these words while I am dreaming I do not make any assertion, I do not affirm any proposition; hence I cannot have made the same assertion that someone else made or that I might make at some other time. I could not, since, by hypothesis, I am dreaming; consequently, I am asleep and not conscious. Merely uttering these words is not to make an assertion. To make an assertion a person must be conscious and mean to say what he (or she) says. That is why Wittgen? stein writes: "Someone who, dreaming, says 'I am dreaming,' even if he speaks audibly in doing so, is no more right than if he said in his dream 'it is raining,' while it was in fact raining. Even if his dream were actually connected with the noise of the rain" (C676). Even if he shouted these words, or uttered them with great emphasis, if he is dreaming, he still can have no idea what he is saying. Hence he cannot ask a question either. John Locke seemed to recognize this point when he observed: "if. .. any one will be so sceptical as to distrust his senses, and to affirm that all we see and hear, feel and taste, think and do, during our whole being, is but the series and deluding appearances of a long dream, whereof there is no reality; and therefore will question the existence of all things, or our knowledge of anything: I must desire him to consider, that, if all be a dream, then he doth but dream that he makes the question-"15 Objection 4. Granted, if I am dreaming, I cannot make an assertion, cannot affirm any proposition or ask any questions. Yet the words I utter, viz., "I am dreaming," are true or at least express a proposition which is true. So in one sense of "say" what I said is still true and meaningful. Similarly, if I uttered the words "I am not dreaming," while dreaming, my words would be false or expresses a proposition which 15 My colleague Rich Hall pointed out this passage to me. It comes from Locke's Essay, Book IV, Chapter XI, Section 8.</page><page sequence="9">THE DREAM ARGUMENT I93 is false. So, again, in one sense of "say," what I said would be meaningful. The same goes for the utterances of parrots: even if they cannot make assertions, the words they utter can be true or false or express a proposition which is true or false. Reply. I said in answer to objection 2 that we should not suppose that linguistic expressions refer or mention things. It is more accurate, as Strawson stressed, to say that referring is some? thing that people do with referring expressions.16 Objection 4 is also guilty of anthropomorphism. It assumes either (1) that sentences are true or false or, alternatively, (2) that they express some? thing, viz., propositions, which are true or false. One might as well say that a shovel is shovelling. The simple truth is that neither is a shovel shovelling nor does a shovel shovel. But people use shovels to shovel. Similarly, they use sen? tences to express propositions, to make asser? tions, i.e., to say something true or false. It is a mistake, however, to think that the sentences themselves do this or that they are true or false. Strawson reminds us that what can be said of a sentence cannot necessarily be said of the use to which we put it, and conversely.17 For example, the sentence may be composed of seven words, but we do not say that the assertion is composed of seven words. It is the assertion which we make and can make with the sentence that is true or false, not the sentence. Objection 5. Even granting that while dream? ing I cannot make an assertion and that the words I utter when I am dreaming will fail to express a proposition, it might still be objected that surely I can believe I am dreaming while I am dreaming. And of course if I had such a belief, I would be quite right, for it would be a true belief. Moreover, one may also want to say that the dreamer is in a position to know whether this is a true belief, i.e., to know whether he is dreaming or not. "He ought to know," we might say of him. Well, if he is sure that he is dreaming and he is dreaming at the time that he is sure that he is dreaming and we grant that he has right to be sure of it, then at least on one account of knowledge18 we are committed to saying that a person can know that he is now dreaming, contrary to the view expressed here. Reply. It is a mistake to think that a dream belief is a belief. It is no more a belief than a birthday suit is a suit. If someone reported that he dreamt he believed he was Hitler, we would not infer that he ever believed he was Hitler even if we accepted his dream report as true. Nor is the dreamer in a position to know any? thing, including whether or not he is dreaming. For he is asleep and hence not in a position to know anything. To say "he ought to know" is absurd for the same reason: it disregards the obvious fact that he is asleep and therefore not conscious. It may be that we can know he is dreaming when he is dreaming, but it cannot be said of him at all that he knows that he is dreaming when he is dreaming. Objection 6. Suppose that the sentences "I am now dreaming" and "Am I now dreaming?" cannot be used in a literal way to make an assertion or to ask a question when one is asleep, since nobody makes assertions or asks questions save when awake. This leaves open the possi? bility that one can use them to make an assertion or to ask a question when one is awake. Again, suppose that dream doubts and dream beliefs should not be confused with real doubts and beliefs; and hence that we should not infer that a person once believed that he was dreaming merely because we know he dreamt that he believed that he was dreaming. People who are awake may nevertheless sometimes believe that they are dreaming. Thus my colleague might dispute the interpretation I gave of his remark "I am (or must be) dreaming," made when he observed the strange behavior of his neighbor. Could not he claim that what he saw was so surprising and unusual that he momentarily believed that he was dreaming or at least that he might be? After all, it is neither a logical truth that one is not dreaming, nor a sense-data statement; consequently, one can doubt it, and one will if one has specially good reasons to. Reply. It is a philosophical error to think that everything which is neither a logical truth nor a sense-data statement can be doubted. Moore has shown us, in his "Defence of Common Sense," that there are many empirical propositions that cannot be doubted. My contention is that "I am not now dreaming" should be included among 16 Peter Strawson, "On Referring," reprinted in Essays in Conceptual Analysis, ed. by Antony Flew (London, 1956), P- 29. 17 Ibid., pp. 30-31. 18 See A. J. Ayer's The Problem of Knowledge (Harmondsworth, Middlesex, 1956), p. 35.</page><page sequence="10">194 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY these indubitable empirical propositions. Thus if any one said he thought he was dreaming or that he doubted that he was awake while he was awake, we would interpret his remark in one of the ways I have mentioned. If the speaker ob? jected: "No, I really do, literally, believe that I am now dreaming," and he persisted in this line, we should think something like, he does not know what these words mean and must intend to say something radically different, or, more likely, that he is not being serious and wishes to pull our leg. We might take his words to be symptomatic of some mental disturbance, but more likely it would reflect a certain philo? sophical training. I do not believe, however, that we would ever?at least outside of a philo? sophy classroom?take the speaker to be ex? pressing a genuine doubt that he is awake. There can be no such doubt, because nothing counts as, or is accepted by us as an instance of, such a doubt. Objection 7. A follower of Frege, who thinks that the sense of a sentence is dependent on the sense of its primary parts,19 may develop this counter argument: If a sentence has sense, all of its primary parts must have sense. "Mary be? lieves I am now dreaming" has sense. "I am now dreaming" is a primary part of this sentence. Accordingly, "I am now dreaming" must have sense; and this sentence literally ascribes dream? ing to the speaker. Reply. Independently of the problem of primary parts, I think it is clear we should reject the Fregean principle. For a sentence can be meaningful even though one of its primary parts is without sense. Proof by counter example: "He believes I am unconscious" and "She be? lieves I am dead" are both meaningful sentences. Yet "I am unconscious" and "I am dead" are without sense, taken literally, for they have no use in the language. We cannot give a story within which such remarks can be imagined to function in a literal way. I have now considered seven objections to the thesis that "I am now dreaming" is without sense unless it is taken in one of the ways suggested; hence that the philosopher's so-called question "Am I now dreaming" is without sense. I hope that we are now convinced that there is no problem left, even though there is no evidence to which we can appeal in order to establish, and no ways in which we can prove, that we are not now dreaming.20 Michigan State University Received May i, 1975 19 Michael Dummett in his fine article on Frege in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ed. by Paul Edwards (New York, 1967), III, p. 228, attributes to him the view that "the sense of a sentence [the thought expressed by a sentence] is built up out of the sense of its constituent words." 20 For helpful comments on an earlier draft of this paper, I thank Chuck Bruce, Jim Hanink, and Ron Miller.</page></plain_text>
