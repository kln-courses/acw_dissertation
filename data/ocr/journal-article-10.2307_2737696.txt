<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Imagining Self in the Eighteenth Century MORRIS GOLDEN IN CREATING HIS WORLD, the writer's imagination takes its shape not only from the theses and explosions and portents of his time, the genres provided by the past, and the enduring myths and archetypes, all of which constitute public experience, but also from his private ways of conceiving reality and dealing with it. No doubt to confute our critical pride, none of these can be precisely defined as an influence on any writer or single work, much less on the literature of an age. Intellectual currents wash over millennia, wars tap undying responses, and genre, myth, and individual psychology merge and separate in the cloudy region of ultimate sources. But if the angels suspect the footing, all the best authorities tell us not to despair. If I cannot pretend to settle each element in its place in eighteenth-century English literature, I can try to look freshly at one, the idiosyncrasies of the author, which tends to be minimized in the continuing reaction to a century of dubious biographical criticism. Without doubting the fundamental importance of the generic in Pope's stance in his Epistle to Arbuthnot, we know that the speaker is related to the Pope of the other poems, and we know that Pope could have chosen other genres and other stances.' If in the narratives of the period we find the universal public dreams of perfect omnipotence and perfect passivity, of perfect love and perfect hate, of serene heaven and restless hell, of passionate heaven and frozen hell, which sensitive writers and philosophers 1 I am most grateful to the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation for its support of the study of which this essay is a part.

What individuates an artist would be the positions he assumes and the myths he most intensely projects; what individuates his period may well be not only its favorite myths but how its artists resolve the inevitable conflicts and divisions in themselves and in the myths that they find congenial. Most or all of our undirected thought, and much that is directed, consists of reveries centering on ourselves, and surely the imagina- tion derives much of its force and shape from our reveries. As a direct product of the individual imagination at work on the condi- tion of man, literature must therefore to some extent embody the writer's vision of himself in the world. His characteristic patterns of theme and trope and sequence will reflect these busy reveries woven around his image in the world: perhaps he sees himself as separated from society, or subject to attack, or eminent above attack, or eagerly seeking adventure, or domestically secure; fear- ing disorder, or delighted with variety or profusion; gloomy with guilt or innocently radiant. If, for example, a writer conceives of himself as an embattled sensible man surrounded by malign chaos, he may project a figure like Gulliver who suffers recurrent attacks on his reason. In a viable artistic world, such a private vision has external allies. While the pattern of hope and disap- pointment partially traces Swift's or Johnson's views of the self, it may also be an inevitable aspect of satire or of all art, an archetype of man's inevitable defeat by death.2 Since a man's reveries are the consequence of his private response to events, it seems more feasible to determine the writers' visions of themselves in the world from their writings than from their apparently objective situations. Knowing the writer's objective situation is a happy dream of critics, impossible to achieve in a fallen world. A substantial body of writings emanates from Pope or Johnson over a long period of time, and in various circumstances and forms, and is available as at once the source and test of criti- cism. But few useful inferences about a writer's behavior can be derived from the social class in which he is loosely filed; people's reactions to him are variable, scattered, haphazardly preserved, 2 Cf. Robert C. Elliott's chapter "The Satirist Satirized" in his The Power of Satire: Magic, Ritual, Art (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1960).</page><page sequence="3">6 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES biased by their own expectations and needs, and uncertain in lan- guage and scope; and events take their importance from their effect on him, not from retrospective empathy. It it much easier to say accurately how Fielding responded to conditions and people that affected him than what he meant to his intimates, his casual acquaintances, and those thousands who had heard of him or seen him. Swift's perfectly ordinary Irish nationality haunted him, to judge by his frequently recorded sensitivity on the subject; while his extraordinary posthumous birth and extended kidnapping in infancy may have molded his attitudes toward authority or independence or reality or sex or the price of pennies in Ireland, they left almost no marks on his writings. Insofar as these private senses of the self are archetypal and recurrent, they are parts of man's universal vision, uniting Virgil with Milton over seventeen hundred years, and Herrick with Horace. While they are not directly or wholly shaped by the times, some appear to be more characteristic of particular periods than others. No northwest passage leads to the vision of a period, but it seems reasonable to seek it in the private visions of its most sensitive people, its literary artists. Our conception of the European ren- aissance or of the American expansiveness of the nineteenth cen- tury is surely based on the exuberant visions of Ariosto and Rabelais and Marlowe, of Twain and Whitman and even Emerson, though there is more to it, as there is more to these writers. If a similar connection exists between the private and the public, be- tween the idiosyncratic in the poet and the character of his culture in eighteenth-century England, perhaps we can find it in a funda- mental element in representative bodies of poetry, the conception of the self striving in the world. While Pope, Thomson, and Smart do not touch all aspects of the imaginative life of the century, they range widely enough and differ in enough ways to provide useful clues to it. II Particularly in his carefully reworked letters but also in his public writings, Pope's urbane, observing self is continually amused, or touched, or morally heartened and always fascinated by his own nature and appearence before the world. In his letters, he charac- teristically sees himself as set off from others, a partially alien figure who had "been born both a Papist and a Poet" and was become</page><page sequence="4">THE IMAGINING SELF 7 almost a freak. Some of this self-pity he borrowed easily from the traditional woes of the poeta, but he surely suffered authentically from religious and physical disabilities.3 With this last cause for a sense of estrangement he mingled another which was specially painful in his youth, his enforced sexual deprivation. While such alienation unfairly restricted the range of satisfactions of his active self, it provided him as reflective being with the rarer ironic joys of renunciation. Concentrated and purified through the artistic imagination, this combination of attitudes is at the heart of such a poem as Eloisa to Abelard. Though the letters of the medieval lovers were of special current interest and though the heroine's stance is to a certain extent determined by the Ovidean genre, the very con- geniality of the genre suggests that she embodies an aspect of ourselves strongly developed in Pope.4 Even when Pope is bitter about his sexual starvation, mainly in writing to the Blount girls or to Lady Mary, his tone seeks pity and admiration, not physical joys: the core of Eloisa's motivation. As she is presented in her convent thinking her letter to Abelard, she is unnaturally deprived of fulfilment, shielded from bodily sin against her will, alien in a unified community, painfully resigned because she cannot be helped. At the end she wants her story to be sung for posterity, preferably by a poet passionate and deprived like herself. As with all of Pope's poetic strategies, the heroine's wish for remembrance was tradi- tionally appropriate; but he used such a wish so regularly that it seems a special yearning for the esteem of posterity, his society with its prejudices removed. Taking his place before the observing and judging world, Eloisa has won this approval. 3For comments on Pope's tendency to play roles and manipulate the image of himself, see George Sherburn's introduction to Pope's Correspondence (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1956), I, xiv-xv; Rosemary Cowler, "Shadow and Substance: A Discussion of Pope's Correspondence," in Howard Anderson, Philip B.

Through literary power he could be eminent, a reforming force, perhaps one of those great men who have transcended their societies. But only in private could he follow his yearnings for warm and sensitive friendship and filial piety. As he says in an early letter, he faced the problem of being a public author with- out, like a whore, being at everyone's disposal; and yet he was steadily eager for praise even from the idle and vain great whom he saw himself doomed as a "poetical fiddler" to amuse. Largely abandoning the lonely, withdrawn poeta with his youth, he re- mained intensely concerned to affect his worthless society, and the aggression of satire was his best weapon against indifference. He was notable enough in the world to see a possibility of success and to smart at the failure; but that part of him which identified with the universal self of human experience knew that it was inevitable. In the Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot, Pope most effectively and di- rectly turns this concern with man and poet into poetry, making himself not merely a witty lecturer like the speaker in The Second Satire of the Second Book of Horace Paraphrased but a complex ideal or archetype. The opening picture of chaos warring with the good man Alexander Pope, of lunatics swarming upon his decent privacy and permitting him no peace because of his eminence as a poet, assumes more and more symbolic relevance as the poem develops. Over the length of the poem the responses to chaos of Pope's striving self are compared with those of other actors before the world, from the helpless slaves of poverty and folly to the rulers of society and the models of probity and good taste. Cen- trally, this warm, impetuous dupe of his good nature is patterned against a triptych of hollow idols, beginning with the frozen, selfish literary exhibit Atticus. After the mindless Bufo, a symbolic nullity like the gaseous Poet set up a prize for the Dunciad's book- sellers, Sporus is a formal moral contrast to Pope-man acting in the world, political and social adviser to a nation-as Atticus had been the competing literary eminence. By his filthy ambivalence Sporus sets off the positiveness, the erectness, and the vigor of Pope the good man who is a poet and also a suffering, trusting, affection- ate, and dutiful son and citizen. In their hopeless sterility, Addison and Hervey are merely aspects of Bufo, subordinate idols wor- shipped without reward by the dunces and everywhere countered</page><page sequence="6">THE IMAGINING SELF 9 by Pope's passionate responsibility. He is their opposite, an inte- grated, feeling man who serves society with the talent that God has given him. With the friendly adversarius Arbuthnot, and with Pope's evaluating self, we nod approval. Pope's literary views and attitudes reflect his inhabiting a fun- damentally harmonious universe which yet shows surface blem- ishes from the imperfection of matter external to man and pride within him. Art is to him a proper dressing out, a way of showing the best features in imitation of true nature, and thus working against satanic chaos. Hoping to imitate God but aware of his human vulnerability, Pope finds artistic perspective paradoxical as early as An Essay on Criticism: great art requires the distance of the ominiscient observer, yet one must rush into the confusion to destroy evil. At times deliberately, his later career embodies these divisions. The Essay on Man, for example, becomes a detached effort to recreate the symmetry of God's universe, while the Dunciad leads into the cluttered, knavish, lunatic vision in the brain of a sleeping hack (following Swift's Grubaean into his wretched dreams, rather like Joyce exploring Earwicker). Pope's aim in both forms, as everywhere, is to reconcile extremes, to give shape from the whirlwind of involvement and to bring intense involvement to harmony.5 In developing this ideal of the Essay on Criticism-a "well-proportion'd Dome," a whole which "at once is Bold, and Regular"-he also advocates art as strategy, as a device for win- ning one's aesthetic way: a view which neatly follows from his pic- ture of himself as a delicate child among normal human beings, an Ariel or Umbriel who moves people by infiltrating their thoughts. Related to Pope's view of himself as poet and as man, each further divided in various pairings, is his characteristic perception of dualities of which man must make harmony. This sense of double- ness and synthesis is reflected in the aesthetic and moral structures of his poems and even in his preferred genres, no less than in the heroic couplet. It governs his practice not only in the didactic poems and formal satires,6 but also in the apparently freer art of 5 Cf.

Aside from its thematic ambiguities and polarities-the implied contrasts in societies, in moral positions, in man's passional nature 7-the early masterpiece works through the balancing and reconciling of central symbols. Belinda is surely (as Cleanth Brooks pointed out) a symbol of her society, an attitude, even an aesthetic; but so also is the Lock. The girl con- centrates the delicate, selfish, fragile, superficial connotations of beauty; the Lock, art, the most powerful defense that man can provide for that beauty against its inevitable ruin by time, but a defense which is itself a ravishment away, an abstraction and con- centration and removal. A vision of the refined, ephemeral, idio- syncratic self is balanced by an objective self which is ironically aware of its own and mankind's brief life. In the public moral moods of his later career, particularly in The Dunciad, Pope tried to repudiate such serious identification with what was now wholly evil. The active selves in that poem are unambiguously foolish, mad, and impotent; but the Scriblerian footnotes and the occupa- tions of the dunces tie them to the author. Still recognized, the idiosyncratic self is renounced as unavoidably poisoned by the times; the universal self alone is norm. In a further expression of Pope's dualism, his vision of lurking dissolution and evanescence is as pervasive in his work as its antithesis.8 He is suffused with a sense of the transitoriness of human ambitions and structures, whether material or in systems of ideas, whether social or philosophic. In Windsor Forest, En- gland's beauty consists of changing reflections on the surface of the flowing river, equivalents in nature of man's brief striving. Even amidst the brash high spirits of An Essay on Criticism, the young poet stops to deplore a world where the finest artist's paints and words nourish the seeds of their mortal illness. In the same way, The Rape of the Lock joins to its tickling an elegy for beauty and movement and youth and life itself for which the only consolation is a partly ironic celebration of art.

The much later Essay on Man, summing up the wisdom to be detailed in the moral essays and satires, is avowedly grounded in man's evanescence: Let us (since Life can little more supply Than just to look about us and to die) Expatiate free o'er all this scene of Man. Let us wander and learn what we can before we return to the sea of time as deflated bubbles. But though he knows that nothing human can last, Pope admires the affirmation of spirit over chaos. Observing humanity, he tends to focus on the difference between the one right way and the jumble of wrong ways, between the shaped bubble which rises into prominence and the non-human sea around it, between the valuable and the worthless, the civilized and the barbarous, the distinct and the dead. Yearning to achieve the significant and yet fearful that his gifts will be lost in the uncreating darkness of his times, he tends to conceive friendship as alliance and is recurrently attracted to the image of the redeeming spark of light or life. Even in the Essay on Criticism, which has often been read as a defense of the critical consensus, the whole world seems provided for the ex- traordinary to exercise their talents, as chaos was essential for God's harmonious creativity. The altar of the greatest ancients, decorated with bays, rises for centuries above the sacrilegious, and Pope himself yearns to join them, to be inspired by them to teach vain wits the truth. He exalts individual judgments as against "the spreading Notion of the Town," the contagion of mass move- ments which was to poison civilization in The Dunciad. Provoking attacks from his own small circle of Catholics, he praises Erasmus for having "Stemm'd the wild Torrent of a barb'rous Age," driving off the "Holy Vandals." While such an attitude was no doubt frequent among Tories in Pope's day and is permanently attractive to the satirist, it peculiarly fits a poet who saw himself as debarred from the common animalism of sex and as one of the few elect in a generally heathen nation. Reflecting Pope's determination and his difficulties in storming the world is his favorite narrative pattern, the journey. From</page><page sequence="9">12 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES Belinda to Dulness and the persona of the satires and moral essays, whether the figures in his fables are divinely chaotic females or ordinary uncertain men, they set off to seek eminence among their fellows. Though Belinda ends lost in ambiguities, the gleams remaining from her radiant embarcation on the Thames shine richly amidst her newly-found mortality. Contrasting with her movement from her shallow self into the active outer world, and enhancing it, the gnome Umbriel sinks through obscurities and phantasms into the Cave of Spleen, a stagnant well in the mind. An Essay on Man, written by a chronic invalid in middle age, still argues that the journey can be happy: Though man is in a maze or on an ocean, he can control his direction and velocity if he sees and follows the right rules. In The Dunciad, the central action is a journey, as defined by Pope's scholarly alter ego Scriblerus: "the Removal of the Imperial seat of Dulness from the City to the polite world; as that of the /Eneid is the Removal of the empire of Troy to Latium." I But it becomes a projection of the fantasies of the vain, mad, contemporary mind, where Dulness in her lengthy triumph prefers her devotees for the same arts which win rewards in this our actual England. Belinda's mild Cave of Spleen, the mental symbol of her world in a pet, has been replaced by a social chamber of horrors, a glimpse into the ingrown core of the whole society. The self-directed journeys of the dunces, as well as more coherent movements, come to one dead stop at the Goddess Dulness, who abolishes all eminence and distinction. Like Pope's admiration for eminence, his preferences of heights to depths or levels and of clarity and light to obscurity 10 are tradi- tional but by no means inevitable, just as his portrayal of God as Artist characteristically selects this one among all the traditional divine attributes. The goddess, grand and dominating, combines eminence in a superlative degree with the obscurity which destroys distinctiveness and truth. She moves in mists, fogs, clouds, and vapors, and her triumph at the end is a return to all things dark, to 9Poems, ed.

In the middle and end of Pope's career, she is a brilliantly cloudy counter to the sunny Belinda of his youth. Through the mutual reflections within what he mentioned to Spence as a unified body of poetry, Pope seems to imply that the precise but tenuous image of the early poem is all the beauty that the artist can now create. A society that worships idols offers vanity and frivolity as materials for his vision, elements which he can shape only into Belinda's delicate beauty or Dulness's amor- phous, lumpy ugliness. In the body of his work, they stand, with Eloisa and his Horatian spokesman, as representatives of man's striving self. More or less, they yield to the mindless, mechanical, selfish evil of the world, or represent it, or fight it, or transcend it. Either directly or by implication, they are always judged by Pope's other self, the reflective spokesman for universal values. III While Thomson shared with Pope such contemporary aspi- rations as synthesis, civilization, and universal harmony, his cir- cumstances and temperament led him to perceive them differently as elements in his vision. Thomson seems to have been the least alienated writer of his time. A Protestant Scot, though something of a foreigner in England, did not face the Catholic's formal and legal restrictions. Where Smollett was to respond to the experience of emigrating across the border with bitter sensitivity, Thomson records no special resentments or compulsions. Aside from a line in Winter about his boyhood joys in storms and a stanza or two in The Castle of Indolence on his poetic ambitions, he does not break the generic limitations of the poeta to speak of his own career or feelings. Perhaps because he is much more restrained than Pope in this respect, he can more directly convey through fiction the peculiar tensions which characterized the life of the poet, and therefore the life of the self. In the "allegory" of The Castle of Indolence, Thomson develops two competing roles of the poet, Magician and Knight, between whom the narrative persona must choose. 11 The 11 See A. D. McKillop's introduction to his edition of The Castle of Indolence and Other Poems (Lawrence: University of Kansas Press, 1961) for a discussion of its themes. Except for The Seasons and A Hymn, for which I use J. Logie Robertson's Oxford Standard Authors edition, this is the text cited.</page><page sequence="11">14 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES conflict can be seen as taking place both in the mind of the poet- everyman and in society, as he separates into dreamer and doer, sensualist and aesthete, hedonist and social reformer. In its resolu- tion, the poem votes for social obligations rather than dreams; the persona's continuing activity is to center on useful literature, not reverie. As against Pope's assumption that the public poet and the private citizen have different but morally comparable duties, Thomson sees the private self as dangerously withdrawn, though potentially the source of creativity. Therefore, like Fielding in Tom Jones, he urges that the artist send his fancies abroad to show mankind its proper study, in the process improving the health of his own mind. This is his view in his letters, in the formal lecture of Canto II, in general where he speaks as moralist. But as a poet apprehending things as they are, the pleasures of the imagination and the paths available in the world, he is more complex and less certain. Indolence in The Castle is the seed ground for the imagination, which provides its own appurtenances: the silent shadowy forms which move about the valley, cousins of Pope's shimmering sylphs and uncles of Gray's bards, here as elsewhere Thomson's suggestions of poetic inspiration; the visions that come before half-shut eyes; the sanctum itself, "Close-hid . . . mid embowering Trees" (stanza vii), the retired and dreaming mind which draws all mankind in pilgrimage. In the next eleven stanzas the resident Magician of this recess is carefully posed before us luring the crowd from the world's work by the enchantment of his song. Since he is leading into the open man's secret wish, indolent reverie, the Poet-Magician's effect on the pilgrims is compulsive (xx), his power great despite his physical frailty (xxii); he plays on them, our substitutes, like a hot seducer on a half-reluctant girl (xxiii), to melt her to his will and her own pleasurable loss. In stanza xxviii and what follows, the castle, archetypally a refuge in the mind for the indulgence of casual fantasies, is also a device that allows the author to move back and forth between fantasy and actuality. The Hebridean shepherd in stanza xxx, a figure in the persona's imagination like the other visions in this section of the poem, has visions like his, refining the filminess of the reverie. In xxxi and xxxii the persona, pinched by his responsible universal self, promises to abandon dreams for his busy poetic duty. But he is drawn back by the castle's seductions, which include tapestries,</page><page sequence="12">THE IMAGINING SELF 15 music, cushions, even a fleeting tickle of sexuality in the reference to the harem bard. The culmination of this sequence in xliii, the sound effects of sublimely titillating storms, neatly and ironically parallels the scene at the center of Winter: insistent actuality outside, and the warm poet feeding his imagination within. Lulled to sleep by the noise of the storm, the mind has with- drawn to voluptuous, incoherent dreams beyond the power of poetry to follow (xlv). Immediately (xlvi-xlviii), the world of moral responsibility warns that the reveries stirred by art, except for elegaic and pastoral memories, form delusive coverings for the empty life. From xlix to lv, Thomson uses the mirror of folly to satirize the activities repellent to any form of poetic temperament: the self-seeking routine of affairs which provides neither beauty nor improvement, the extreme of unimaginative practicality that balances the sterile fancies of sleep. As a reminder of the need to fuse the two, the arrested poeta of lvii-lx is a case study of the inability to break from visions to their expression, an artist who suffers awake from dreams which he cannot objectify. Stanzas lxxii-lxxiii, the last two in the canto by Thomson, show a further sense of the real dangers of indolence: the tedium and decay in the secret dungeon of the mind, where self-indulgence has destroyed the will and the reason. As most of Thomson's contemporaries would have agreed, the self-enclosed mind is the final horror. In Canto II, the Knight of Arts and Industry, the self that rec- ognizes its obligation to society, that works for civilization and fruitfulness and progress, is the dominant representative of the poet. This hero, whose celebration is to constitute the return to vigor of the persona's imagination (iv), grew up in a rough peasant hut, buffeted in his youth by sun and shower. Tutored by Minerva and the muses, he knew all the arts and sciences, pure and applied, including psychology and moral rhetoric. And he practiced them incessantly. Like a poet from Scotland facing the challenge of England, Accomplish'd thus he from the Woods issu'd, Full of great Aims and bent on bold Emprize To-wit, a barbarous World to civilize. (xiv) Naturally, the Knight makes his seat in Britain: the symbol and ideal vision of human society, like the Magician's castle a place in the mind. As the Magician lures the active energies to languish inward</page><page sequence="13">16 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES so the Knight constantly brings them out to healthy involvement. Summoned to his quest by news of the self-indulgent debility spread by the corrupter, the Knight sets out with his bard Philo- melus to destroy the castle. As soon as these emblems of the moral establishment confront the wizard, the entertainer-poet- outlaw, they strike him with fear (xl). In a major attack (xlvii- lxiii), the old bard balances the Magician's song in the first canto, calling for light, air, nature, adventure; repudiating the alternative as capitulation to death; advocating a great spurt from one's cen- tral will to overcome inertia. In Ixiv, his chaste counter to the sexual innuendo of the Magician's lure arouses the virtuous to life, as the sun's rays wake the snow of the mountains into gay freshets. On another front, the Knight waves his wand to show the confirmed indolent that their happiness is delusive, their private withdrawal rotten, and they themselves doomed unless they reform immediately. In lxix, the horrible recess is opened, and in lxxiv the wand calls up angels to help those of good will in an allegory of moral action. The last stanzas, lxxviii-lxxxi, show the hell awaiting the incurable, the balancing vision of the true Castle of Indolence: a wasteland ruled by Beggary and Scorn, the bogeys of the conscientious bourgeoisie. The wavering self-the persona, the pilgrims, all those not totally fooled by routine activities-must renounce fruitless reverie and seek social art if it is to save itself, do its duty, and please its universal observer. As everyone has pointed out, the second canto is far more the product of will and moral intentions than of poetic congeniality. Reverie, the stuff of fancy and poetry, has not been organically united with social reality. But in opposing them, as in developing his themes and techniques generally, Thomson maintains his extraordinary representativeness. Almost all of eighteenth-century English literature implies that the public and private are equivalents or parallels of the real outer world and the world of fantasy, the fusion occurring only in the very greatest works: The Rape of the Lock, Tom Jones, Songs of Innocence and Experience, Emma. Thomson's sympathy with the archetypal adventure into the world and the corollary pattern of release of energies is central also in The Seasons (particularly in Spring) and notable in Liberty and the less ambitious poems. Not only does he see good as con- sisting in the principle of expansion, excursion, flowing out into the</page><page sequence="14">THE IMAGINING SELF 17 world;'2 his imagination is also stirred by potentialities, by the hidden treasure or possibility coming to light or flower, by the great positive value of piercing into the essence, leading it out, allowing it to radiate. The agent for bringing it out is an active principle of good, an imitation of the sun or of God, a fructifying or civilizing faculty. In Spring, for example, Thomson parallels the hidden flower manifesting its energies as it blooms and the poet, "me," leaving the town for the country, where . the raptured eye Hurries from joy to joy, and, hid beneath The fair profusion, yellow Autumn spies (1 1. 1 1 1-1 13), with the full implication of a cycle, of the future held in the present. Heaven "sheds" various plants on nature, and "Swift fancy fired anticipates their growth" (1. 183), the seed within the mind re- sponding to the hidden potentiality outside. The sun is the proto- type of those who seize hidden truths (11. 394-395); a fisherman brings treasures out of the depths (1. 396ff); a beloved girl has "looks demure that deeply pierce the soul" (1. 486), awakening its vital responses. From the apostrophe to God as creative source in line 556 to the concluding domestic ideal, a number of images of drawing out, pouring in, and gripping the core convey the surge to life and growth in spring, within men as in external nature. As the center of Spring, as at the center of the world's living activities, is an impelling force, an eager excursive energy. When tracing "Nature's great command" (1. 634) to increase and mul- tiply, Thomson presents the elements of this force as a complex latent in the whole poem: all creation is driven by spring, which connects fertility, love, sex, fighting, and adventurous explorations to show that all movement can feed life and is eternally to be contrasted with frozen death. And this, as the raging bulls (direct from a similar role in Virgil's third Georgic) and indescribably violent sea monsters demonstrate, is an immense force, not the breeze of genteel attraction. Though not so extensively as Spring, the poem of birth, the other Seasons and the lesser poems also reflect a universe where life is huge profusion and movement and variety.'3 Even in Winter everything but the seat of the god is 12 Cf.

As against Pope's universe of careful shadings, Thomson's is a harmony of profusion and bold contrasts. While he shares with Pope a perfectly artistic universe, he adores not the subtle painter of light and shade, but God the spectacular impresario. Another aspect of these visions of love and universal harmony is a vision of social and psychological harmony concentrated in an ideal of civilization, which Thomson like Pope sees constantly endangered by barbarism. In Summer as in The Castle and Liberty, England is the hope and nourishment of the world, an emblem of the divinely fruitful (1. 1408ff, esp. 1442-1445), a recessed island surrounded by storms which spreads humanity to the world (11. 1595-1601). The brutal days and sordid nights of hunters, in the middle of Autumn ( 1. 470ff) , are played off against idyllically busy peasants at harvest, the awakening of Scottish industry, poets in their inspiring groves, and the learned man rising above supersti- tion and folly (1 1. 1133-1137). In Winter, Thomson celebrates the civilizers who can bring warmth to the frozen soul: among others physical scientists like Newton and those aboriginal social scientists who were investigating prisons with humane intentions (1. 359ff), all hoping to bring truth and civilization out of the mixed confusion of phenomena. Peter the Great shines toward the end as a humane contrast to the dull, frozen barbarians of the north, as Chesterfield early in Winter is admired for bringing culture to the English, and as the middle of that poem drones its celebration of the great culture bearers of history. The Knight of Arts and Industry may not be our ideal, but in the vision of progress he is Thomson's. As might be expected, evil for Thomson is everywhere the perversion or negation of the good, the Castle's poles of the sleeping mind and the barbarous aggressions in the mirror of folly. The images are similar to those of civilizing adventure but carry oppos- ing implications, the pattern of motion in the universe being as regular as gravity. In Spring, Thomson shows that while God educes harmony from nature, the fallen human mind is the seat of chaos, which activates a series of painful passions (1. 272ff). Decay is now erosion, "inward-eating change" (1. 333), as against creative piercing to the core. Summer, describing a more sublime season when God's might is more visible than his love, manifests brutality in man and nature. After barbarous man, the hidden</page><page sequence="16">THE IMAGINING SELF 19 snake, and the inharmonious roar of the lion, the sublimity of Africa culminates in the archetypal horror of the shipwrecked solitary (11. 939-949), a horror sharpened for Thomson because it subverts adventurous hopes. Moving out of the self, out of the protected past, one may reap expressiveness, discovery, and social usefulness, but one may also founder in bitter isolation. Winter shrouds the last agonies of death as Summer heated the passions of barbarism, and man's own center responds with superlative agony: The soul of man dies in him, loathing life, And black with more than melancholy views. (11. 61-62) From its lair "Then issues forth the storm with sudden burst" (1. 153), an opposition and reflection of the coming forth of the springtime sun, or latent seeds of life, or the hidden truth, or the poet's vision. In groves, horrible ghosts howl to the storm, as against the inspiring shades of the earlier sections (11. 191-194). From the east and north, Thick clouds ascend, in whose capacious womb A vapoury deluge lies, to snow congealed. (11. 225-226) From another center, the heart of winter's domain, wolves burst out to perpetrate a series of horrors, which culminate in their dig- bing up and eating the most sublimely forbidden treasure, recently buried corpses (11. 389-413). At the North Pole itself, the center of winter, the god holds his court of death (11. 887-901): an absolute zero of activity, in contrast to the divine center, the world's source of energy and intensity. Though Thomson is usually concerned with natural phenomena and with social ways of attaining Shaftesburian union, he at times raises his search to the instant of fusion itself, the supreme moment in which the spirit directly apprehends the divine. In Spring, for example, the apostrophe to God conceives of Him as a secret, creative element in the center of being: Hail, Source of Being! Universal Soul Of heaven and earth! Essential Presence, hail! (11. 556-557) Summer ends in a vision of Philosophy darting through the universe, ranging from matter to the idea of God, to "the ideal kingdom," through the imagination to "notion quite abstract," finally to the indefinable mystery. In Autumn Thomson asks, in a congenial image, where "the vast eternal springs" are hidden "like creating</page><page sequence="17">20 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES Nature" from the mortal eye, and he wants the answer to be pro- vided by the * pervading genius, given to man To trace the secrets of the dark abyss! (1 1. 777-778) The conclusion of Winter, the summit of The Seasons, affirms that heavenly knowledge comes after death, including the knowledge of the reward of "unassuming worth" which "in secret lived": now the good can know all and can see spring everywhere. In A Hymn on the Seasons, as in the end of Summer, the highest sense is silent rapture: contemplating God, . . . lose Myself in him, in light ineffable! In A Poem Sacred to the Memory of Sir Isaac Newton Thomson is equally at home with the sublimity appropriate to visions of the earth and heavens. He reveres Newton, he says, because it was he * . . whose well-purg'd penetrating Eye, The mystic Veil transpiercing, inly scan'd The rising, moving, wide-establish'd Frame. His soul transcended the human, surveying the universe at large, reaching to the source (1. 128), imitating God's position above and beyond the local. As Spring (11. 203-212) and Summer (1. 803ff) also suggest, such adventuring over space and time14 is parallel to the divine, particularly in piercing and discovering and showing forth the millenially hidden. Using what has been brought back, on the other hand, is the province of the ambiguously human arts and industry. While purging man of the brutal and the indolent, the civilizing process also endangers the innocent, the personal, and the imaginative. Free of such destructive tendencies, the step before the Fall, the search for and discovery of the divinely hidden core, is for Thomson the purest movement of which man is capable, fusing the scientific and the artistic in the imaginative in imitation of God. In the very process of uniting the imaginative and the practical (as by the Knight of Arts and Industry), the civilizer must moderate the divine for a fallen world. Bringing the 14 But space is his peculiar medium: cf. Ralph Cohen, "Thomson's Poetry of Space and Time," in Howard Anderson &amp; John S.

Christopher Smart, though an Englishman and an egregiously orthodox Anglican, considered himself an outsider, a small and helpless orphan in need of patronage, protection, special consider- ation. Perhaps reflecting his circumstances as the learned son of a steward, his narrative poems regularly tend to oppose the humble and the grand. In The Tea Pot and the Scrubbing Brush, The Bag- Wig and the Tobacco-Pipe, The Brocaded Gown and Linen Rag, Mrs. Abigail and the Dumb Waiter, The Country Squire and the Mandrake, The Blockhead and Beehive, The Herald and Husband- Man, and Munificence and Modesty the pretentious figure scolds the lower one, like a Fielding lady's maid domineering over a foot- man, but the humble triumphs. Such a resentful folk view of society from below is accompanied in Smart by a down-to-earth "realism," particularly in evaluating women, as opposed to the fantasy which the century called romantic. Smart's attitude, a vulgarization of Fielding's, combines sexual delight with intellectual contempt. When he writes to individual women, he can be vividly responsive, as in the poems to Harriot or to his wife, or mildly ribald, as in The Distressed Damsel or On a Woman Who Was Singing Ballads. In his narratives he tends to see women as shrill, extravagant, in need of control if they are not to become bankrupts or shrews or whores. After Generosity impov- erishes herself (Care and Generosity), frugal old Care offers marriage, and they live happily ever after under his rule. Wooed by the beautiful Imagination, the recluse Reason (Reason and Imagination) refuses marriage because he cannot bear restriction, but he courteously offers friendship and supervision. Almost all the foolish or scolding figures in the fables are female, and in the unguarded Jubilate Agno Smart's fear and contempt are occa- sionally unmistakable: "For I prophecy that there will be less mischief concerning women. For I prophecy that they will be cooped up and kept under due controul." The loss of the horn which man had in David's day has weakened man's domestic dignity: "For it is instrumental in subjecting the woman. For the insolence of the woman has increased ever since Man has been crest-fallen. . . . For man and Earth suffer together. For when</page><page sequence="19">22 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES Man was amerced of his horn, earth lost part of her fertility." 15 When women forget their proper place, they minimize man, with whom Smart clearly identifies himself, his heroes, and his God. Smart seeks and bestows praise as the one note which sustains universal harmony; when mockery reigns, chaotic hell ensues. Smart's casual dismissal of women, like his response to all nature as dazzlingly material, suggests that he is the least devoted to introspective fantasy of the significant writers of the century. Mockery can destroy such fantasy in an instant. His amused con- tempt for the conventionally ideal is apparent in one extended toy- ing with the role of poeta, his trio of poems on the parts of the day. A Morning Piece totally substitutes generic convention for realism, the peasants being mere sticks in the pastoral tradition. In A Noon-Piece, the poeta can either sit with a beloved girl on a shady river bank and fish, thereby changing from the traditional lone dreamer to a courting youth, or act out with her the amorous passages in Sidney's romances. By the third poem, A Night-Piece, or, Modern Philosophy, Smart openly subverts the poeta. Sophron the Wise congratulates himself on aloofness from the bustle of business and then, recollecting his engagement to one girl, goes to spend the night with another. As in Reason and Imagination, Smart insists that our sphere is material reality, the world around us, not the abstractions or reveries of the poeta. To judge by his own sad fate, perhaps he insists too much. This world of matter registers upon him as joyous individual sensations, distinct from each other and from everything else."6 In his art, in his cosmology, in his general view of world relationships, Smart places emphasis on the individual sensations, as against Pope's on the harmoniously woven work. Toward the latter part of his career, Smart thought that the special distinction of the finest poetry was the literary equivalent of this effect on the reader, "the beauty, force, and vehemence of Impression" or "punching, that when the reader casts his eye upon [the words], he takes up the image from the mould. . ." 17 Indeed, in its sharpness of 15Jubilate Agno, ed.

Everywhere in this poem, as often in others, Smart emphasizes the separateness of each element which sends up a thread of adoration to God. Though he believes in the chain of being and in order and subordination, he also senses a movement directly from the stones to God and from the angels to God, the focus of the rays singly emitted from every created thing. Following on this equalitarian vision, Smart shows relatively little interest in evil.'8 The sentimental evils-ingratitude, which he called the sin against the Holy Ghost, and those mocking qualities combined in "Ill Nature," against which he wrote a poem- sum up the opposition to the divine will. Smart's universe is not a moral stage, since creation fulfils its sole duty to praise almost involuntarily. In Thomson's anthropomorphic Seasons, if a bird's song is sad to our ears he has lost his wife, and wolves and sharks, like human exploiters, have evil motives; for Smart, all things call on man to share their pure wish to adore God. The greatest and manliest man is the greatest praiser, untainted by the destructive and solely human urge to mock: the most intense spokesman for creation, different only in his power of impression from an oyster or a mountain. While such a sense of a world of intensely real matter uniting to affirm male grandeur need not derive from Smart's background and self-view, they are obviously congenial. IV One of Smart's lesser performances as praiser may lead us back from his idiosyncratic sensations to one common ground for his contemporaries, the need to have the proper sensations. In his Ode on St. Cecilia's Day, an exercise in the ornate-sublime Cowleyan Pindaric, various elements combine to illustrate and praise music's power to sway its hearers. Representative in its very mediocrity, the poem reflects the wish through the century- supported by Lockean psychology if not rooted in it-for a way to modulate the passions and make them feelings or sentiments, to turn Mr. Shandy's ass into a gentle and tractable beast.

Robert Brittain's Introduction to his ed. of Smart's Poems (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1950), pp. 59-61.</page><page sequence="21">24 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES this view becomes a bralnch of psychology to be exercised not merely as a demonstration of rhetorical skill (as by Timotheus in Alexander's Feast) but to achieve the moral improvement of Richardson's, Smollett's, and Sterne's struggling characters and of their readers. In poetry, Dennis, recalling an accepted tie of rhetoric and aesthetics, ticks off the different passions, and sug- gests which genres are to deal with them; and equivalent guides were available for painting."9 Thomson's Season's deliberately played over the whole range of passions, from the sublime to the gentle, from awe or love to mockery, and Burke's essay on the sublime and beautiful showed later poets how to achieve the grandest effects. The artist and his creatures become halves of a unified consciousness: Underlying the figure of the artist senti- mentally teaching his characters is one of the century's dominant images, Locke's picture of the mind observing its own operations, a reflective self alert to direct the striving, apprehending self. The same doubleness of self opposes the real and the fanciful, a fundamental division which shades into the oppositions of the public and the private, responsibility and self-indulgence, prac- ticality and imagination, civilization and barbarism. Based on the virtues of sympathetic communication, it pervades the attempts in the eighteenth century to tie the outer to the inner, to seek those elements of identity which can help the self to assimilate the impact of phenomena, understand them, and act outward to them. Where the century's other edenic vision, the pastoral, could be condemned by Pope and Johnson as cowardly introversion, with all its absurdities and deficiencies the sentimental is a healthy en- gagement with the world. Fielding's most socially oriented and "realistic" novel, Amelia, is also by most definitions his most sentimental. Like the techniques of sentimentalism, the figure of the poeta attempts to fuse the private with the public, in this case through literary tradition. Even Thomson's rudimentary poeta is separated from other people not only to encourage private reveries (though that is one purpose) but also so that he may dream and brood for 19 John Dennis, 'The Grounds of Criticism in Poetry," in Willard Higley Durham, ed., Critical Essays of the Eighteentth Century (New York: Russell &amp; Russell, 1961, a reprint of Yale University Press ed. of 1915), 143-211; see also Brewster Rogerson, "The Art of Painting the Passions," JHI, XIV (1953), 68-94; Walter John Hipple, The Beautiful, the Sublime, and the Picturesque in Eighteenth- Century British Aesthetic Theory (Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1957), p. 305.</page><page sequence="22">THE IMAGINING SELF 25 manikind. In Gray the figure who mourns the little boys at Eton or all the dead in church and churchyard, or pleads with Adver- sity for a feeling heart, or watches youth waste its spring, has become far more than a rhetorical device. By seeing himself, the declassed survivor of twelve children, in the persona traditionally set off from a watchful society, Gray can fit into his vision poetry, art, social justice and human fulfilment, the whole duty and destiny of man. Even in the poetry of Gray and his model Milton such a solitary figure shows a strain of guilt which allies him to archetypal itinerant outcasts, like Savage's Bastard and Wanderer. Goldsmith, adding the expulsion from Eden, makes the poet a wandering observer of societies as Gray's outsider judges life within a society. But where Gray at his best perfectly balances the visions in his mind and the external reality so that the dead peasants and aristocrats and village poet animate the churchyard and church and village around him at evening, Goldsmith has the mournful, alienated, sensitive, imaginative ideal self mix undigested fantasies of seduced maidens and grotesque tyrants with a dis- tracting lecture on demography. In Gray's best poems, like the Eton Ode or the Elegy or The Bard, he achieves the fusion of the species in the individual; in The Deserted Village we must our- selves raise the elements to the same symbolic level, transmuting squires so that they can act on the poeta's recollections of his fall, before we can accept them as organically relevant. Where Gold- smith succeeds, he succeeds through the poeta's emotional response to his vision of himself and a world fallen together, not through the richness of the interplay of poeta and world. The world in the mind and the world outside are dissociated beyond the power of the reflective self to unite them; it can function as a guide only to feeling, not to action. Fearful of the doom to which his fantasies always led, Cowper tends to divest the poeta of its public attributes and shape it for the specific, phenomena-connected daily personality which he pre- sented to the citizens of Olney and Weston. Though he does not repudiate the traditional figure, he allows it only the minimal function of introducing him to the reader, after which he provides details exclusively about himself. That is, he wanders like the poeta in the shade and reflects on the meaning of nature, on the futility of human bustle, on the power and the glory of God. But</page><page sequence="23">26 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES he is accompanied by a middle-aged lady in walking shoes, and he does not throw himself on the sward whatever his agony over man's condition. In him, the poeta becomes as submerged in the actual poet as he is to be in Wordsworth. If the triumph of outer reality in Cowper leads us to the eighteenth-century novel, this is still the world of which I have been speaking. Beneath the easy lustiness which has so attracted our movie makers are a complexity of theme and vision as great as in the poetry and a similar fashion of imagining them. Moll Flan- ders, Clarissa Harlowe, Tom Jones, Roderick Random, even Tristram Shandy seek harmony and integrity as they wander their planned mazes. Like Thomson, Richardson inhabits a probing, projecting world of intense energies and deep recesses. Sterne's persona, isolated, abandoned, and mocking in the world, hugging and juggling his impressions of the impervious bubbles around him, is like Smart at least in registering an immensity of discrete sensations. Some aristocratic novelists like Fielding, Smollett, and Goldsmith affirm an original order which is capable of reinstitution if man would only cooperate. Amidst the bleakness of current society, they are likely to see such order as emblematic visions within the mind: a noble pair radiating goodness over a country estate, like Tom and Sophia or the couples at the end of Thomson's Spring and in Smart's Epithalamium; Auburn, long dead with the poet's innocent childhood; Loch Lomond, an inaccessible para- dise. While such an ideal is congenial to conservatives in the eighteenth century, it touches universal man: The Odyssey, The Tempest, The Cherry Orchard, and Wild Strawberries suggest that it is more private than a party and as public as mankind. All these threads of theme and technique are necessarily woven into the figure of man projected against the world which is always part of the artist's imagination and in the eighteenth century was at its center. Animating this emblem of struggling mankind, and underlying the words and actions of the work, is the author's private cheering or admonishing vision of himself. The writers are consistently aware of universal intentions in their idiosyncratic portraits, and very often they self-consciously paint in front of a mirror: vide Tristram Shandy or the Epistle to Arbuthnot. Almost every eighteenth-century writer presents ironic epitomes of himself, which he persuades us are also visions of what is in us.</page><page sequence="24">THE IMAGINING SELF 27 While it is true that Swift's Tale sums up earlier traditions, it also introduces an element not available in Erasmus's Praise of Folly or even in Hudibras, the figure representing his particular society, a reflection of faults which no one at all in his time and place could avoid. And in Gulliver's Travels the hero-butt who looks at a Yahoo and recognizes himself reenacts his author's discovery and anticipates ours. Where this vision of the self is lacking, as in A Song to David, the work stands or falls as an artistic primitive, depending on a one-dimensional ordering of brilliantly varied sensations. But where it exists, it helps form the vision that ties the writer and his art to the world. Pope in his sylphs and ambitious authors and protean idols, Thomson in the mildly burlesque antagonists of The Castle of Indolence, Cowper in the wandering of his painful sufferer before God, Gray weighing the importance of his solitary against the solidity of mankind, all suggest the ironic vision of the self in the world, idiosyncratically varied but representative of the mankind in which it is to live. The characteristic narrative pattern of the century is the journey, from innocent Eden into action and confusion, Johnson's Cairo of the mind; the characteristic central figures are posed before us with the ambiguous limitations which their creators knew only too well. Throughout the century, the observing self wonders how much of the world its acting complement imagines, how much exists independently, how much pain should be suffered to make these imaginings useful to other selves (if other selves in fact exist), and how much of the whole business is simple self-indul- gence. In reflecting the private visions of the writers of the eighteenth century, the complementary struggling and observing selves are at the center of its public utterance, its literature. If we overlook either the private or the rhetorical selves, we imperil our understanding of the literature and of the period. University of Massachusetts, Amherst</page></plain_text>
