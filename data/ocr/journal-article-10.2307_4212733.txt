CASSIDAY Satire has enjoyed a long and distinguished history on the Russian stage: since the eighteenth century, playwrights such as Denis Fonvizin, Aleksandr Griboedov, Nikolai Gogol', Aleksandr Ostrovskii, Aleksandr Sukhovo-Kobylin, and Anton Chekhov created a classical repertoire for the Russian theatre comprised primarily of satires. Vladimir Maiakovskii's dramatic work continued this rich tradition of satire in the Russian theatre and applied its techniques to the creation of propaganda on politically aligned stages after I917. Much like his eighteenth- and nineteenth-century predecessors, Maiakovskii ridi- culed contemporary foibles, blended and bent traditional literary and theatrical genres, drew upon topical material, and chastised society in the hopes of reforming it. 1 His three plays from the I 920S Misteriia- buf (Mystery-Bouffe, I 9 I 8 and I92I), Kiop (The Bedbug, I928) and Bania (The Bathhouse, I929) helped to bring Revolutionary satire out of the cabarets of Moscow and Petrograd and into the repertoires of the Moscow Art Theatre and the Meierkhol'd State Theatre among others. By incorporating modernist scenic innovations and his own raw verbal energy into these plays, Maiakovskii adapted the tried and true formula for satirical success on the stage to the demands of the post- Revolutionary theatre of the I 920S. Although he followed the pattern of the most admired works in the Russian theatrical repertoire, Maiakovskii's plays met with stiff critical opposition in the Soviet cultural establishment of the decade. The playwright composed all three of his plays for the era's most visible and controversial director, Vsevolod Meierkhol'd, and worked in close contact with Meierkhol'd to create each play's mise-en-scene. As a result of this collaboration, the premiere of each of Maiakovskii's plays inspired the same impassioned debate that characterized Meierkhol'd's Julie A.

CASSIDAY other productions during the decade, for example, his controversial stagings of Gogol"s Revizor (Inspector General) in I926 and of Griboedov's Gore ot uma (Woe from Wit) as Gore umu (Woe to Wit) in I928. Regardless of Maiakovskii's and Meierkhol'd's proclaimed political correctness and the relative popular success of these produc- tions, Misteriia-buff Kiop and Bania caused critics to challenge the political orthodoxy of each play's satirical message at a time when the viability of satire in Soviet literature and theatre had fallen into question.2 The critics' increasingly sceptical and eventually hostile attitude toward Maiakovskii's plays indicated the unacceptability of the satirical tradition in the Russian theatre by the end of the decade. Soviet critics' discomfort with the defiantly chaotic and hybrid nature of satire is entirely understandable in the context of dramatic art devoted to Revolutionary propaganda. Politically aligned theatres of the time, both amateur and professional, wished to convey a clear message to their audiences; they sought to advance palpably the construction of socialist society by depicting Revolutionary transforma- tion and progress on the stage. On the one hand, according to the first Commissar of Enlightenment Anatolii Lunacharskii, other theatrical genres such as melodrama offered the clearest means for reaching peasant and proletarian spectators with this message.3 On the other hand, satire, by its very definition, resists the teleology and closure inherent in melodrama and demanded by the Revolutionary theatre. In place of the well ordered and formulaic representation of melo- drama, satire offers carnivalization of both content and form: the satirical play borrows its characters from the reality beyond the footlights and appropriates a melange of literary and scenic forms for their depiction. The dual mockery of form and content produces a distinctive friction between stage and life that gives theatrical satire its didactic edge.4 In the Soviet Union of the I920S, playwrights such as Maiakovskii, Nikolai Erdman and Mikhail Bulgakov pushed the theatre toward ever greater satiric carnivalization while political demands and artistic strictures pulled it in the opposite direction.5 By I930 this conflict came to a head and satire found itself exiled from the very social order it had once sought to chasten. Maiakovskii managed to use 2J. A. E. Curtis, 'Down with the Foxtrot!

The rising carnivalization that transformed Maiakovskii's political correctness into heresy is clearly visible in tropes for personal and social hygiene in his plays. At first glance, the appearance in all three plays of metaphors of cleanliness seems coincidental, but closer examination reveals that hygiene played a central role in the era's conception of satire, not only from the playwright's point of view, but also from that of the cultural establishment as a whole. The ongoing debate over satire's viability in Soviet culture focused on its social function, on its usefulness as a tool 'to cleanse [raschishchat'] the consciousness in order to prepare it for a reconstruction unexampled in the whole world'.6 The vocabulary of the time shows that the concept of cleansing entailed a wealth of related terms tied to cleanliness on both the personal and the social level. The verb chistit' (to clean) and its related noun chistka (cleaning or purging) referred not only to polishing shoes and scrubbing kitchen floors, but also to purging unwanted elements from the Communist Party and socialist society. All that was socially undesirable and merited such cleansing fell under the rubric of meshchanstvo (petty bourgeoisie or philistinism) and could be removed from the individual and from society through the process of samokritika (self-criticism). Proponents of satire claimed that samokritika was an efficient and effective means of cleansing society of its philistine elements.7 As a Revolutionary artist, Maiakovskii employed the terminology of social cleansing both in his plays and in debates defending satire as a mode of dramatic expression. Unlike other playwrights of the era, Maiakovskii embraced this associative cluster with unusual enthusiasm, most probably due to his own obsession with personal hygiene. According to one contemporary, Maiakovskii 'was a maniac for cleanliness and felt an almost pathological fear of infection. He washed his hands an unusual number of times a day, and whenever he was away from home, he used the soap he carried in his [own] soap 6 '0 putiakh sovetskoi satiry', Literaturnaia gazeta, no.

CASSIDAY holder'.8 It comes as no surprise that someone who displayed what psychologists now label obsessive-compulsive behaviour would adopt and expand the metaphors of social hygiene in his writing. For example, in a I923 article entitled 'Mozhno li stat' satirikom?' (Is it Possible to Become a Satirist?), the playwright answered this question in the affirmative and encouraged aspiring satirical writers to realize 'the possibility to clean [pochistit'] the Soviet "interior" more seriously' in their writing.9 In his own plays, Maiakovskii took this advice to heart and actualized the implications of the hygiene metaphor that initially promised to clean the dirt but ultimately purged such satires from Soviet society of the time. As Maiakovskii's first play written in service of the Revolution, Misteriia-buff established what one critic called 'the style of new theatrical writing, the rhythm of the new theatrical Revolution'.10 Much of the play's success arose from Maiakovskii's skilful use of the satirist's traditional tools: he mixed the genres of medieval mystery and opera-bouffe, as the play's title indicates; he incorporated topical material that would, according to his own instructions, be changed in subsequent productions; and he lampooned the bourgeois and imperi- alist West in figures such as French Premier Georges Clemenceau and British Prime Minister David Lloyd George. 1 But a large part of the play's success as a satire came from the fact that Maiakovskii not only conceived of Miste7iia-buf as a satirical cleansing of post-Revolutionary society but also portrayed this cleansing in the very action of the play. The plot of Misteriia-buff is extremely simple: a flood, symbolic of world-wide Revolution, swallows up the earth, and all that remains of humankind are seven pairs of the bourgeois Clean and seven pairs of the proletarian Unclean. Maiakovskii puts the hygiene metaphor at the very heart of his drama by reworking the biblical story of the flood into a modern-day mystery of Every Proletariat. 12 In the I 9 I 3 play Vladimir Maiakovskii: Tragediia (Vladimir Maiakovskii: A Tragedy) and the I923 poem Pro eto (About That), images of floods had intensely personal significance, originating in the poet's tears which flowed into rivers that became oceans engulfing the earth. While Misteriia-buff shares this imagery of an elemental and uncontrollable force, the flood in the play is taken out of the subjective realm of the playwright's grief over lost 8 Wiktor Woroszylski, The Life of Mayakovsky, trans.

Like a planetary tidal wave, the flood of Revolution surges from country to country, east and west, north and south, until it encompasses the world-wide proletariat. The deluge washes away the bourgeoisie and all its evils to leave the world cleansed of capitalism and purified for the building of commu- nism. In order to survive the flash flood, the Unclean build an ark and overthrow the oppressive rule of the Clean on their way to the promised land. Maiakovskii's names for the two choruses in the play, the Clean and the Unclean, extend the social hygiene metaphor. At first, it seems that Maiakovskii confuses his labels and contradicts the expected aftermath of the Revolutionary flood. If the deluge cleanses the world and purifies humanity, why do only those labelled dirty, impure and Unclean survive its bath? However, Maiakovskii uses the apparent contradiction to create a word-play based on both meanings of chistyi as physically clean and spiritually pure. The chorus of the Unclean has the grimy fingernails and thick calluses of the working class and, hence, is unwashed in the literal sense of the word. Despite the actual dirt that covers them, the hearts and minds of the Unclean are immaculate. Conversely, the chorus of the Clean is comprised of well-groomed, fashionably-dressed and delicately-perfumed ladies and gentlemen, whose souls capitalism has fouled and dirtied. The external cleanliness of the Clean superficially covers their spiritual filth. Maiakovskii has chosen his labels for the Clean and the Unclean not only out of a love of irony but also to describe the inverse relationship between the characters' external and internal purity in the play. Although the Unclean are actually far cleaner than their Clean counterparts, they none the less undertake a journey to purify themselves further. The Unclean pass through hell and heaven and into a chistilishche (purgatory) that they themselves must tidy up to become the masters of earth and the builders of a worldly paradise. The denouement of Misteriia-bufftakes place as the Unclean collectively labour to restore order in Razrukha (the Land of Ruin) and construct paradise on this earth by the sweat of their own brows. Interestingly enough, Maiakovskii includes a laundress and chimney sweep among the Unclean to illustrate their role as the janitors of the planet. When the Unclean enter the Land of Ruin, one of their number explains this duty: 'What should we do? We need to clean up [raschistit']."13 Although the flood of Revolution swept over them uncontrollably at the play's beginning, the Unclean now sanitize the earth and make 'The path even, smooth, and clean [chist]'.14 Maiakovskii emphasizes the agency 13 Misteriia, p. 33 I- 14 Ibid., p- 340.</page><page sequence="6">648 JULIE A. CASSIDAY of the Unclean in constructing the earthly paradise, clearly contrasting them with the passive and freeloading Clean. Maiakovskii's use of the terminology for personal and domestic hygiene in Misteriia-buf suggests another closely related metaphor of the time, that of parasites sucking the life blood of the working class. In an article previewing the I9I8 production of the play, the first Commissar of Enlightenment Anatolii Lunacharskii provides the label to which Maiakovskii merely alludes by describing Misteriia-buff as 'a cheerful, symbolic voyage of the working class which gradually frees itself from its parasites after the Revolutionary flood'.'5 As Maiakov- skii's subsequent plays would prove, parasites became increasingly difficult to exterminate and germs ever harder to disinfect as the I 920S progressed. None the less, during the era of Misteriia-buff eliminating the enemies of the Revolution seemed as simple, inevitable and permanent as the flood imagery in the play implied. By realizing the very metaphor for satire in the action of Misteriia-buffJ Maiakovskii created a play whose Revolutionary form, content and function were unambiguous and received the applause of critics and audience members alike. Unlike Misteriia-buff Mop offered a markedly more ambiguous satire of the nouveaux riches who profited from the capitalist retrenchments of the New Economic Policy (NEP). Although the action of MZop duplicated the division between chaotic present and utopian future as in Misteriia- buff, the later play extended the trope of cleanliness to a degree that undermined its intended social satire. As a result, critics treated Mop sceptically, but audiences applauded Maiakovskii's hilarious verses and Meierkhol'd's playful mise-en-scene which provided a breath of fresh, comic air in the theatre at the end of the decade. The increased irony and ambiguity of Mop arose from Maiakovskii's development of the metaphors of germ and parasite which the trope of cleanliness had only implied in Misteriia-buff Critics and spectators immediately recognized the hero of M7op, Ivan Prisypkin, as the quintessence of the petty bourgeoisie, as 'a character who has been petty-embourgeoisified to the point of complete bestial- ity'.'6 More rightfully called the play's anti-hero, Prisypkin appears in the cast of characters as 'a former worker, a former Party member, currently a fiance', and he is anything but the model Soviet citizen.'7 As the playwright's designation suggests, Prisypkin represents an unusually pestiferous class of byvshie liudi (former people): renegade proletarians who joined the Communist Party as part of the Lenin 15 Lunacharskii, 'Kommunisticheskii spektakl" in SS, III, p. 39-40 (40). 16 "'Klop".

Prisypkin hopes to profit from his impeccable proletarian lineage and his newly acquired Party membership by arranging a marriage with the daughter of a prosperous Nepman, the curvaceous and alluring beautician El'zevira Davidovna Renaissance. Prisypkin epitomizes the petty bourgeoisie that was subjected to samokritika and chistka throughout the 1920S. The first half of Mop, set in I929, develops the character of Prisypkin by correlating his superficial personal hygiene with deeply embedded moral filth, as Maiakovskii had done earlier in Misteriia-buff As his very name indicates, Prisypkin is a syp' (rash or eruption) on the skin of Soviet society that requires prisypka 'dusting powder' to alleviate the itch. Regardless of his brand-new lacquered shoes, his freshly sprouted sideburns, his ability to fox-trot, and his new, kitschy surname 'Skripkin' (from skripka [violin]), Prisypkin will always be associated with itchy maladies of the skin that discomfort the Soviet body politic. Just like the Clean in Misteriia-buff Prisypkin's personal hygiene is only skin deep, as his former working-class mates point out. Prisypkin dresses and carries himself like a gentleman, but 'He's got sideburns like a dog's tail, and he doesn't even wash he's afraid to mess them.'8 Prisypkin betrays this personal filth by scratching the vermin infesting his person while he practises the latest dances in preparation for his forthcoming wedding. Prisypkin's marriage to the Renaissance family reinforces the superficiality of his cleanliness. Prisypkin has thrown over his working- class fiancee Zoia Berezkina to wed the daughter of a stereotypically avaricious family of Jewish Nepmen. Interestingly enough, every member of the Renaissance family works in the personal hygiene trade in the family barber shop and beauty salon. Mr and Mrs Renaissance shave and coif customers while their daughter El'zevira provides manicures. Prisypkin has abandoned his proletarian heritage of dirty calluses earned by manual labour to join a family with carefully filed fingernails and intricately styled hair. It scarcely comes as a surprise when the wedding of 'unknown but great labour with prostrate but charming capital' turns into a drunken brawl as the guests at the wedding show their true, dirty colours.'9 The wedding party grows ever more inebriated, until the uncultured and unclean nature of Prisypkin and his in-laws agitates and literally ignites the marriage celebration, which is consumed in the ensuing flames. In the second half of Mlop, set in I979, Maiakovskii extends the hygiene metaphor to include the parasites, vermin and germs referred 18 Ibid., p. 229. '9 Ibid., p. 238.</page><page sequence="8">650 JULIE A. CASSIDAY to by the play's title. As Prisypkin's itching in the first half of the play indicated, he has carried a tiny insect-passenger on his person into the world of the future, which resurrects both of them after fifty years of frozen sleep in the burned-out basement of the wedding party. Prisypkin's thin layer of grooming no longer hides his petty-bourgeois filth from the world of I979, whose standards of cleanliness are much higher than those of fifty years ago. The present world in the first half merely criticized Prisypkin's betrayal of class, country and Revolution, but the world of the future correctly labels him the true parasite in the play: Prisypkin is a leech sucking the blood of socialist society, a virtual Typhoid Mary spreading a host of social ills. The audience first glimpses the future as two custodians tidy up a room designed to house a complex voting apparatus that relieves the citizens of the future from voting in person and risking the spread of harmful microbes. As the elder of the two janitors reminisces about the long-lost era of his childhood, the spectators listen to him describing the stark contrast between the smelly and grimy auditorium in which they sit and the disinfected and gleaming vision on stage. When representatives from all regions of the earth discuss resurrecting the frozen Prisypkin via teleconference, the threat of bacteria and infection from the past immediately enters the debate. If the future decides to resuscitate the petty-bourgeois Prisypkin, it will have to worry about 'the danger of spreading the bacteria of brown-nosing and conceit [ ...] about the possibility of introducing an epidemic of brown-nosing!'.20 In actual fact, as soon as Prisypkin comes back to life, the diseases of love, profanity, smoking, and drinking appear in society for the first time in fifty years. Prisypkin's antisanitarnye obychai (unsanitary customs) prove to be dangerously contagious in the sterile environment of the future.2' Ironically, the scientists of the future show more interest in the rare insect Prisypkin has brought into their midst than they do in its smelly and infectious host. Only by offering himself as a source of food for the bedbug and as a rare specimen of wildlife in his own right does Prisypkin find a home for himself in the zoo of the future. The zoo's director explains the complex relationship between the human parasite Prisypkin and the insect he feeds: I have just become convinced, by means of interrogation and comparative bestiology, that we are dealing with a terrifying, anthropomorphic impostor, and that it is the most startling and parasitic of parasites [... .] They are two, differing in size but the same in essence: they are the famous Bedbugus normalis and [ ...] and the Philistinus vulgaris. Both are found in the musty mattresses of time. Bedbugus normalis, when it has grown fat and drunk on 20 Ibid., pp. 247, 249- 21 Ibid., P. 255.</page><page sequence="9">SOCIAL HYGIENE IN MAIAKOVSKII 'S SATIRES 65I the body of a single human, falls under the bed. Philistinus vulgaris, when it has grown fat and drunk on the body of all humankind, falls on top of the bed. That's the only difference!22 In fact, Prisypkin poses a much greater threat to the society of the future than the common bedbug as the play's action proves. With great curiosity, the future world labels Prisypkin a parasite and, ultimately, determines that he is less than human. The same quasi- scientific, quasi-medical, and ultra-hygienic terminology that emerged in conjunction with show trials of the enemies of the people during the 1920S had made its way into the popular imagination and dramatic representation by I 928. Only a few months before Maiakovskii composed Zlop in the autumn of I928, the first Stalinist show trial, the so-called Shakhty Affair, had condensed these associative clusters into a single term vreditel' (wrecker or saboteur), which described a new hybrid of man and insect strikingly similar to Prisypkin: Wrecker, this is a new word in the Soviet vocabulary. Before, this word and such a term didn't exist. Rather, this term was used only for insects and birds who damaged crops and destroyed wooden buildings. Wrecker, this was some kind of little beetle or grasshopper undermining young stems. Wrecker, this is some kind of worm eating away the beams of buildings, an aphid damaging vineyards. Until this time, there hasn't been such a profession among people [... .] There were human vices, and there were no virtuous insects, beetles or worms [...] People-wreckers never existed before. This breed of human-insect was created by capitalists in their struggle against communism. Only hatred for socialist construction and only a consciousness that this construction is possible could cause a man to turn into a louse.23 Maiakovskii transposes this damning description into a satirical register in order to dehumanize Prisypkin in KMop. As the play comes to its close, Prisypkin is more and more frequently compared to vermin, to bacteria, and even once to a mastodon. Finally, through the use of the neuter pronoun ono (it), the zoo director demotes Prisypkin permanently to the status of an insect or animal. In spite of countless attempts to raise Prisypkin 'up to human level', he remains a dangerous source of 22 Ibid., pp. 27I-72. 23 L. Zaslavskii, 'Vrediteli', Pravda, no. I15 (3947), I9 May 1928, p. 3.

CASSIDAY what one critic called 'the bacilli of love and drunkenness'.24 As a social parasite, Prisypkin must be quarantined and kept behind a series of filters that eliminate the threat of an epidemic of petty-bourgeois backsliding called tarakanovshchina (cockroachitis) -among the citizens of the future.25 In Meierkhol'd's words, Prisypkin's fate illustrates graphically that '[The] petty-bourgeois element is sucking us dry, a nirvana of Oblomovitis, nothing brings us out of the state of indifference.'26 In spite of this politically attuned message, as a piece of satirical propaganda Miop displayed several shortcomings that critics quickly noticed and questioned. Prisypkin never realizes the superficiality of his personal hygiene, never grooms his soul as he does his body, and never joins the sterile society that cages him in the zoo. He is not only incapable of doing this, but also unwilling. The unregenerate petty bourgeois longs for the small creature comforts (and discomforts) that gave his life meaning fifty years in the past and keep him in a state of primitive filth in the future. Prisypkin never finds sufficient reason to join the society of I 979 and, consequently, he never cleans up his act so that he can become part of the future. In spite of the fact that he represents all the ills of the petty bourgeoisie, Prisypkin elicits the spectator's sympathy with his senti- mental poeticizing, earthy joie de vivre, and his final appeal to his contemporaries in the audience at the play's end. Prisypkin's dislike of the sterile world of the future makes it less appealing to the audience watching the play. The reaction of this dirty and drunk degenerate alone, however, cannot turn the utopia portrayed by Maiakovskii in the second half of Alop into a dystopia. But, when taken with the curious response of the citizens of the future to the infectious Prisypkin, spectators must wonder how desirable this utopia is. While most of the citizenry of the future run in fear from Prisypkin, a small portion finds itself inexorably drawn toward the symptoms of the diseases he carries, so much so that some even volunteer as candidates for infection. The germs of petty-bourgeois degeneracy are highly virulent and, indeed, they cross lines between species to infect dogs in the play. As the scientifically designed air-conditioner separating Prisypkin from his keepers and visitors in the zoo shows, even momentary contact with a carrier results in infection in the form of fox-trotting, beer-drinking and love-making. The sterile society of the future cannot control the spread of Prisypkin's diseases and finds that: 'The epidemic is spreading [ . ]. 24 KIop, p. 263. B. Alpers, '"Klop" v Teatre imeni Vs.

The very possibility of eliminating the petty-bourgeois diseases at issue comes into question by the end of Miop. When taken together with the attraction of these ills and the almost palpable fondness for the lost past that emerges in the second half of the play, the need for such a sterile future devoid of dirt, feeling and romance becomes highly equivocal. The critic Boris Alpers sensed this equivocation in the play and criticized Kiop for not taking its satire far enough. According to Alpers, Maiakovskii's script focuses on an insignificant part of the petty- bourgeoisie and as a result, paints the object of its satire in only the most general of contours.28 Yet exactly the opposite is true: the playwright accurately reveals a dangerous element lurking in Soviet society and depicts Prisypkin's crimes in living colours. However, Maiakovskii extended the satirical cleansing metaphor to its logical but paradoxical end. In spite of the playwright's intent to cleanse society in Kiop, his satire no longer contained the simple propaganda message that the theatre of I928 demanded and, instead, his play questioned the very social order it meant to defend. In Bania, Maiakovskii repeated many of the dramatic techniques found in Mop and Misteriia-buff such as splitting the play's action between the present day and a utopian future and dividing its dramatis personae into friends and foes. Maiakovskii aimed his satire in Bania at the leviathan Soviet bureaucracy. In addition to railing against Russian red tape, Maiakovskii included a small play within a play that chastised the contemporary theatre for uninspired and incomprehensible Revo- lutionary propaganda. The metatheatrical third act of Bania created understandable tension between Maiakovskii and his critics; nonethe- less, Bania as a whole provided much clearer and less problematic satire than KMop. In place of Prisypkin, who receives the audience's simulta- neous scorn and sympathy, Maiakovskii placed an undeniably anti- Soviet enemy who bears the full brunt of spectators' condemnation.29 For his paragon of bureaucracy, Maiakovskii created a speaking name that decides his anti-hero's fate at the end of Bania.

Unfortunately, these additions have not been preserved. My discussion of the play is therefore based on the surviving script as published in Maiakovskii's complete collected works.

CASSIDAY whose multiple connotations point to the character's enemy status and intimate that he will be purged from the idyllic future described in the play.30 First, the name Pobedonosikov refers to the ideologue of tsarist reaction under Alexander III and Nicholas II, Konstantin Pobedonos- tsev, whose name came to signify reaction itself at the beginning of the twentieth century. Secondly, Pobedonosikov is a variation of the epithet pobedonosets 'bearer of victory', which typically followed the names of saintly princes who sacrificed their lives in holy battle to defend Russia's honour. Maiakovskii ironically styles Pobedonosikov as a bearer of victory on the bureaucratic front of Soviet society. However, inserting the diminishing syllable 'ik' turns the lofty epithet into an insulting tag: no longer does the character's surname refer to bearing victory in administrative battle but instead to someone who has a nosik (little nose) for bureaucratic victory, a nose for sniffing out a comfy post and a potentially lucrative position. Thirdly, Maiakovskii's abbreviation for Pobedonosikov's official post, glavnachpups, reinforces the impression of Pobedonosikov's self-serving nature. By carefully selecting the syllables that constitute the abbreviation, Maiakovskii suggests that Pobedonosi- kov is more the boss of his own pup (navel) and self-gratification than he is of any bureau or ministry. In confirmation of these negative insinuations, the other characters in the play quickly discover that Pobedonosikov's political pedigree reflects an overriding concern for personal profit and welfare. On questionnaires that require an explanation of the glavnachpups's activities before I 9 I 7, Pobedonosikov ambiguously answers 'Was in the Party', without specifying exactly which political party he has in mind.3' As the critic Ermilov pointed out, Pobedonosikov epitomizes the problem of Party degeneracy at its very worst.32 Such self-absorption and dubious political ties mark Pobedonosikov clearly as the enemy in Bania and lead predictably to his exclusion from the time machine driven by the Phosphorescent Woman to bring exemplary workers to the society of the future. Maiakovskii's play legitimated the purging of this new species of Bolshevik, the bureaucratic boss. Critics recognized Pobedonosikov's emblematic character in the play and coined the word pobedonosi- kovshchina (Pobedonosikovitis) to describe not only what plagued the world of Bania but also the real-life red tape on which the play was based.33 Only with extreme irony does Maiakovskii place accusations 30 N.

While Bania depicts the necessity of cleansing the Soviet state of bureaucracy, the play also contains a thinly veiled warning as to the potential abuses of the terminology for social hygiene by enemies such as Pobedonosikov lurking in the state bureaucracy. Pobedonosikov's fall from power and exclusion from the future paint a convincing picture of the need to scrub the bureaucratic dirt out of the Soviet state and to sweep the artistic dross out of the theatre. Maiakovskii all but eliminates the vermin and germ metaphors from the dramatic action of Bania; none the less, the trope of cleansing effectively explains the satirical function of his play. By the time Maiakovskii composed Bania, the terminology of wreckers, purging and self-criticism had been fully articulated, and, instead of elaborating the hygiene metaphor in the action of the play, Maiakovskii reserved it for his title. But what relationship does the title of Bania bear to its satirical, anti-bureaucratic message? In jest, Maiakovskii claimed that he named his play Bania: 'Because it's the one thing that isn't there.'36 All jesting aside, Maiakovskii's tide refers to no action within the play itself, but to the play's didactic function as a work of satire that strove ustroit' baniu (to make/organize a bathhouse), that is, to carry out a purge.37 In an article introducing a published excerpt from Act Six of the play, Maiakovskii explained: 'What is Bania? Whom does it wash? Bania is a "drama in six acts with a circus and fireworks". Bania washes [moet] (it simply launders) bureaucrats. Bania is a piece of publicistic journal- ism.'38 In a slightly later article of the same type, Maiakovskii repeated the idea that: 'Bania cleans and washes [chistit i moet]. Bania defends horizons, inventiveness, enthusiasm.'39 Maiakovskii also incorporated Bania, pp. 3 I 8- I 9. 35 Ibid., p. 325. 36 Maiakovskii, 'Vystupleniia na zasedanii khudozhestvenno-politicheskogo soveta Gos. teatra imeni Vs.

CASSIDAY the cleansing metaphor in the slogans which he composed to hang on the walls of Meierkhol'd's theatre during performances of the play. For example: 'We can't clean the swarm of bureaucrats right away/And there are neither enough bathhouses nor enough soap for us.'40 On another poster, Maiakovskii wrote, 'Clean and purge [vypar' i prochist'] every bureaucrat /with the worker's broom and art's brush.'41 In his title and commentary on the satiric function of Bania, Maiakovskii repeated the cleansing and social hygiene tropes that lay at the base of his earlier plays. While examining Maiakovskii's choice of title, we cannot forget that much of his defence of 'horizons, inventiveness, [and] enthusiasm' had profoundly personal as well as broader social application. At the time, Maiakovskii was embroiled in long-term politico-literary hostilities, not the least of which revolved around Bania itself.42 The argument over his rights, duties and affiliations as a satirical playwright threatened his artistic horizons, questioned his inventiveness, and certainly diminished his own enthusiasm. When taken with the play within a play in Act Three of Bania, the threat to Maiakovskii's artistic freedom provides one more answer to the question 'whom does Bania wash?'. Maiakovskii wanted his comedy to launder the Soviet state of its bureaucracy and simultaneously to cleanse the contemporary theatre of productions that he jokingly named 'The Squaring of the Chery ... Uncle of the Turbins'.43 Unfortunately, the reasoning of those who called the theatre 'Back to the classics!' in Act Three of Bania reflected a good deal of the controversy surrounding the playwright and his play.44 The jabs made at Glavrepertkom (the Main Committee on Repertoire which func- tioned as the primary theatrical censor) and Maiakovskii's critics reflect the real-life struggle to pass Bania through the censorship, as well as the genuine bitterness with which critics reacted to the play and in which Maiakovskii's struggle with critics and censors ended. Lunacharskii's famous catch-phrase 'Back to the classics!' is soundly condemned within Bania, but, outside the play Maiakovskii represented a dwindling minority that had not yet taken this slogan to heart. As a result, Bania simultaneously satirized the stagnation of Soviet bureaucracy and questioned the viability of such theatrical satire in the Soviet Union of I930. Maiakovskii attempted to maintain his charismatic power as a writer of theatrical satire and to preserve satire's social function, which other institutions in Soviet society had long since usurped. However, the satire in Bania decreased neither the bureaucracy of the Soviet state 40 Maiakovskii, '(Lozungi dlia spektaklia "Bania")' in PSS, xi (hereafter 'Lozungi'), p. 350. 41 Ibid., p. 35 1 - 42 MayakOVSky, PP- 336-5I. 43 Bania, p. 317. 44 Ibid., p. 3I0.</page><page sequence="15">SOCIAL HYGIENE IN MAIAKOVSKII 'S SATIRES 657 nor the artistic stagnation in the Soviet theatre, but it did make the playwright highly suspect and susceptible to the very cleansing and purging that he elaborated in all three of his major plays of the decade. Maiakovskii contributed to the popularity and development of satire in Soviet theatre and literature during the I 920S.45 Yet he discovered that the satirical techniques he had developed in Misteriia-bufand Mlop were distressingly out of place and time in 1930. In Bania, the satire of Soviet bureaucracy as represented by Pobedonosikov proved so general that it was, in effect, a critique of the entire Soviet state. In the aftermath of Bania, the playwright found himself accused of ideological as well as artistic counter-revolution.46 The trials and tribulations of bringing Bania to the stage left the playwright so bitter that he made a final jab at the play's critics in the note explaining his tragic suicide only a month after the play's premiere.47 Ironically, Maiakovskii had helped develop the very metaphors of cleansing that would purge him, his theatrical works and theatrical satire as a whole from the Soviet stage of the next decade. By employing 'satire's parasitic appropriation of other forms', Maiakovskii's plays of the I920S effectively extermi- nated themselves from the active theatrical repertoire of the time.48 45 For a discussion of Maiakovskii's role in the development of prose satire during the I 920S, see Richard L. Chapple, Soviet Satire of the Twenties, Gainesville, FL, I 980; and Karen L. Ryan-Hayes, Contemporagy Russian Satire: A Genre Study, Cambridge, 1995, pp. I -4. 46 The critic S. Mokul'skii accused Maiakovskii of describing the world of the future in Bania with an anti-Soviet tinge, 'Eshche o "Klope" ', Zhizn' iskusstva, no. 13, 24 January I929, p. IO. Other critics of Bania also pointed out Maiakovskii's insulting portrayal of Soviet reality and his apparent lack of faith in the very regime he claimed to support in the play. For an example, see "'Bania"', PSS, II, pp. 277-354. 47 The critic V. Ermilov, who initiated the bitterest of the exchanges around the play, was attacked in one of Maiakovskii's slogans for Bania and it is to this slogan that the suicide note refers. For the slogans satirizing Ermilov, see 'Lozungi', p. 350; for the suicide note, see Maiakovskii, 'Pis'mo I68' in PSS, xiii, p. 138. 48 Theorizing Satire, p. 5.</page></plain_text>
