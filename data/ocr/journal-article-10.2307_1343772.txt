<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Public as Sculpture: From Heavenly City to Mass Ornament Michael North The most notable development in public sculpture of the last thirty years has been the disappearance of the sculpture itself. Ever since Jean Tinguely's Homage to New York destroyed itself at the Museum of Modern Art in 1960, sculptors have tried to find new ways to make the sculptural object invisible, immaterial, or remote. Where the sculpture did have some material presence, it often took unexpected forms. As Rosalind Krauss says, "Rather surprising things have come to be called sculpture: narrow corridors with TV monitors at the ends; large photo- graphs documenting country hikes; mirrors placed at strange angles in ordinary rooms; temporary lines cut into the floor of the desert."' However various these experiments may seem, they began with a single motive: to escape the constraints of the pedestal, the gallery, and finally of art itself. To prevent this new work from becoming just another commodity in the market, artists either produced works so intangible or remote they could not be bought and sold, or dissemi- nated their ideas in so many reproducible forms they could not be 1.

Changing the nature of the art meant changing the role of the audience as well, ques- tioning the purely contemplative role the observer plays in the conventional setting of the museum or gallery. According to Henry Sayre, "As the avant-garde work of art denies its own autonomy, it implicates the audience in its workings."' As the aesthetic focus shifts from the object to the experience it provokes, the relationship of the two goes beyond mere implication: the public becomes the sculpture. Artists, like Richard Serra, whose goal is to illuminate the material nature of space and the often tenuous materiality of the observer's own body, have made "the viewer, in effect, the subject of the work," to quote Douglas Crimp.4 This idea, that sculpture becomes public by taking the spatial expe- rience of its audience as a subject, is so seductive it has influenced everything from Serra's steel fortresses to the benign and cheery works featured in many shopping malls. If anything unifies the whole range of contemporary sculpture from minimalism to the political agitation of Krzysztof Wodiczko, it is the idea enunciated best by Krauss, that contemporary sculpture takes as its subject "the public, conventional nature of what might be called cultural space."5 The shift Krauss describes from the inner space of the artist's psyche to the exterior space of public convention dissolves the old opposition between artist and audience and makes all sculpture potentially public. The gap 2. For a discussion of this motive and the works emanating from it, see Barbara Rose, American Art since 1900, rev. ed. (New York, 1975), pp. 222-23, 274-84. The earth- works of the late sixties and early seventies exemplify both tactics, since these huge constructions could rarely be visited and were therefore only available in the form of documents. The two aspects of the earthwork are related dialectically: the actual construction is far more precious, unique, and removed from use than a conventional painting or sculpture, but these qualities are disseminated in forms that undermine them by subjecting them to reproduction, often in temporary media. For all this, as Lippard has pointed out, "'temporary, cheap, invisible, or reproducible art has made little differ- ence in the way art and artist are economically and ideologically exploited'" (quoted in Sayre, The Object ofPerformance, p. 15). 3.

In this way, contemporary sculpture promises to overcome the conflicts that have jeopardized the very idea of public art, and yet the old controver- sies over public sculpture continue to be replayed. If the motive of contemporary sculpture is that of "'actively bringing people into a sculptural context,' " as Serra says of Tilted Arc, why does so much of the public still feel walled out?6 Some answers might emerge if we consider the long history of the metaphor of the public as sculpture. Even postmodern works evoke this history, though perhaps without knowing it. For example, at Docu- menta 7 in Kassel in 1982, Joseph Beuys exhibited a massive work called 7000 Oaks, which consisted of seven thousand large basalt stones arranged in a triangular pile pointing to a single oak tree. Individuals or organizations were to buy this pile, stone by stone, and in so doing sponsor the replanting of Kassel, one oak for every stone. This work dramatically realizes the disappearance of the sculptural object, since it would in fact vanish, bit by bit, in the process of being bought.' It also illustrates in its workings the replacement of that object by the audi- ence, for the real work of art here is the community's replanting of Kassel. Though Beuys was certainly interested in the trees, his real purpose was to awaken individuals to community action and thus to make what he called "'social sculpture.' "8 The disorderly pile of stones would give way gradually to a coherent social structure, to what Beuys called elsewhere "'social architecture,' " in which each individual would take the place of a single stone.9 Given Beuys's well-known religiosity, it is entirely possible that he is consciously evoking the biblical prototype of his two metaphors, social sculpture and social architecture. The most succinct version is to be found in 1 Peter: "Come to him, to that living stone, rejected by men but in God's sight chosen and precious; and like living stones be your- selves built into a spiritual house" (1 Pet. 2:4-5). The metaphor is most 6. Quoted in Grace Glueck, "Serra Work Stirs Downtown Protest," New York Times, 25 Sept. 1981, sec. 3, late city edition. 7. In his account of the work, Andreas Huyssen calls it an "art for vanishing." He emphasizes the difference between this work and those protectively enclosed in the galleries of Documenta 7 (Huyssen, After the Great Divide: Modernism, Mass Culture, Post- modernism [Bloomington, Ind., 1986], p. 179). He apparently did not witness Beuys's rage when the pile was spray-painted bright pink.

In his epistle to the Ephesians, Paul tells his readers they "are no longer strangers and sojourners," but "fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God built upon the founda- tion of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone, in whom the whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom you also are built into it for a dwelling place of God in the Spirit" (Eph. 2:19-22; see also 1 Cor. 3:9). Paul uses the metaphor of the congregation as a building, with the indi- vidual as a single stone, to compose a miscellaneous gathering of converts into a single church and to give hope to the spiritually and politically homeless by linking their church to the chosen people of the Old Testament. The congregation, which at this stage may not have had a physical building at all, becomes a figurative building and finally a metaphor of the Heavenly City. In early Christian writing, therefore, the metaphor was used to define what Augustine called civitas: "'a multitude of reasonable beings</page><page sequence="5">864 Michael North The Public as Sculpture voluntarily associated in the pursuit of common interests.'"'0o In this form, it became a commonplace of devotional writing, appearing in standard emblem books through the seventeenth century. For exam- ple, George Wither's Emblemes (1635) depicts a foursquare cubic stone hovering in space and below it a poem that concludes: Lord, let us into such like Stones be squar'd: Then, place us in thy spirituall Temple, so, That, into one firme Structure, we may grow." Naturally, the metaphor was put to good use whenever actual building projects had to be consecrated. When Abbot Suger, who directed the building of St.-Denis, the first Gothic cathedral to be completed, wanted to sanctify his construction, he turned to Ephesians 2:19.12 Three centuries later, the great building projects of Pope Nicholas V were accompanied by versifications of the same passage, including a poem by Cardinal Juan de Torquemada that depicted the congregation as a building whose "walls are faith made up of stones that are squared and solid."'3 In his work, Beuys implicitly appeals to this Christian ideal of a communitarian social structure exemplified by a beautiful building in which each stone is necessary to the whole. But the Abbot Suger and Pope Nicholas V were also using the metaphor of the congregation as a building to legitimate their power as social architects.'4 When the metaphor was adapted to secular building projects, its repressive possi- bilities became fully apparent. Around 1460, Filarete composed a treatise on architecture addressed to Francesco Sforza in which a great prince tells his heir, "'A domain is like a wall made of many and various ragioni (orders) of stones. ... As it is necessary for you to maintain all the qualities of stone in this wall, so it is necessary for you to maintain 10.

See to it that you are the master and the architect of this wall.""' Here the metaphor confirms the power of a secular master and maintains the boundaries between the ranks below him. The logical end of this version of the metaphor was reached three centuries later, when Giam- battista Vico reinterpreted the ancient story in which the music of Amphion charms actual stones into forming the walls of Thebes. Vico read the story allegorically, with Amphion in the role of an ancient king and the stones as what he called "the doltish plebeians."'6 In the course of time, the emblem of Christian community had become an allegory of despotism. Something of this historical ambiguity survives in Beuys's work, exposing an ambiguity in the contemporary metaphor of the public as sculpture. Almost from the beginning of his tenure as professor of monumental sculpture at Diisseldorf, Beuys made workshops and conferences part of his art. Rather than erecting monuments, Beuys seriously intended to make the people into a monument, a social work of art, one that would be constructed by each individual as "'sculptor or architect of the social organism.' " At the same time, he said these indi- vidual efforts were to result in the "'TOTAL ART WORK OF THE FUTURE SOCIAL ORDER.'',"7 How individual freedom is to be squared with the totality of the social system, how there might be many architects or sculptors of a single total work, Beuys left to the imagina- tion of his audience. But the implications of the Total Work of Art, suggesting the complete integration of each detail into the whole, seem to conflict with Beuys's overt message of freedom. As history shows, the metaphor of the public as sculpture contains both possibilities, commu- nity solidarity on one hand and autocracy on the other. The role of the metaphor in modern politics has been equally ambiguous. In the Social Contract, Jean-Jacques Rousseau used the metaphor of the public as a building to argue that laws must conform to the common sense of the people, who are the "immovable keystone" of that building." In 1830, Charles Duveyrier combined Rousseau's build- 15.

Millon and Linda Nochlin (Cambridge, Mass., 1978), p. 39. According to Westfall, Filarete puts these words in the mouth of Francesco, but he does so only by means of a complicated allegorical ventriloquism involving a golden book about a prince who very much resem- bles Francesco.

That the polity could be represented as a single gigantic individual indicated the respect for individual rights on which it rested. That this huge individual could also contain the multitude showed symbolically that this respect for individual rights was in fact the principle that unified the citizenry. When the Washington Monument was dedicated in 1885, Robert C. Winthrop praised the obelisk in similar terms, noting that it was not a monolith but a composite of many individual blocks and thus could symbolize "'our cherished National motto, E PLURIBUS UNUM.'"20 Here, in these usages evocative of the great revolutions of the eighteenth century, the metaphor of the citizen as building block of the social sculpture loses for a moment its repressive implications because the whole is but the part made great.21 Thus the aesthetic avant-garde of the early twentieth century could make the metaphor part of a call for a new revolution and a new visionary utopia. In Germany, on the eve of the First World War, Bruno Taut proposed a Cathedral of the Future, a communitarian symbol that became a kind of trademark of the Bauhaus.22 In calling for new, secular, revolutionary cathedrals in which the people would become "'organic members [Glieder] of a great architectural struc- ture,"'2" Taut returned to the very metaphor that had sanctified the Gothic cathedral itself. This belief, that society might be regenerated by making its members parts of a great work of art, was so strong that 19.

A whole history of this particular version of the metaphor of the public as sculpture might be written, from Alexander's plan to turn the cape of Athos into an inhabitable city-statue (see Ernst Bloch, The Utopian Function of Art and Literature: Selected Essays, trans. Jack Zipes and Frank Mecklenburg [Cambridge, Mass., 1988], p. 191) to Corbusier's anthropomorphic plan for Chandigarh. This history would perhaps center on the Neoplatonic idea, found in Ficino and Pico, that the world is itself a statue, sculpted by God. 20. Quoted in Charles L.

But there is another, more gruesome irony in Giedion's statement. That he might have called in 1944 for "collective emotional events" in which people merge with the architectural background implies a certain political amnesia. For the Nazis had made such "collective emotional events" a key part of their domination of Germany. Films like Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will have preserved for all time the carefully orchestrated combination of massed crowds and heroic architecture that was Albert Speer's contribution to modern art.'5 The Nazi propaganda masters specialized in what Robert R. Taylor has called "'human architecture,' "26 and it was Joseph Goeb- bels himself who gave our metaphor its most chilling modern expression: "'The statesman is an artist too. For him the people is neither more nor less than what stone is for the sculptor.'"27 Thus the utopian program of aesthetic modernism was realized in an ironic form by totalitarian governments. The audience entered the work of art, became the work of art, but only as what Siegfried Kracauer called "mass-ornaments," "human ornaments" that denote "the omnipotence of dictatorship."28 But such human ornamentation was not only to be found in Nazi Germany. Kracauer originally used the term "mass ornament" in 1927 to describe the Tiller Girls, an Ameri- can chorus line popular in Germany. For Kracauer, this form of dance, based on a simultaneous duplication of steps and gestures by an entire line of performers, represented the modern degradation of the individ- 24.

The construc- tion of an edifice depends on the size of the stones and their number. It is the mass which makes the impact. Only as parts of a mass, not as indi- viduals who believe themselves to be formed from within, are human beings components of a pattern."" What Taut had dreamed of, a great edifice composed of individuals as building blocks, Kracauer saw already achieved in the regimentation of capitalism, which had merely to be radicalized to become the Nazi spectacle. When Beuys called his work "social sculpture" or "social architec- ture," he perhaps should have trembled at the complexity of the historical and political background thus evoked. The similarity between his "social architecture" and the "human architecture" of the Nazis shows how ambiguous the relationship is between the avant-garde and power. In fact, the whole turn from sculpture-as-object to public-as- sculpture was anticipated by the governments of the West. In France, Germany, England, and the United States, there was a rage for commemorative statues that began in the last decades of the nineteenth century and peaked about 1914. After that time, according to Eric Hobsbawm, the emphasis shifted from statuary to great empty urban spaces in which massed crowds were to provide the aesthetic impact.s0 Government was, therefore, several decades ahead of the avant-garde in discovering that the audience could be given the role once assigned to the sculpture. The statue of democracy erected recently by the students in Tiananmen Square may have signified not just a taste for sculptural allegory but also the rebellion of the crowd against its own service as human sculpture in the square. The question facing artists like Beuys is how to keep the communitarian hopes and the revolution- ary implications of the metaphor of social sculpture alive when the autocratic possibilities of the metaphor are so painfully realized. The sharpness of this dilemma was made visible in a recent show at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, a show that included works by Vito Acconci, Siah Armajani, Alice Aycock, Lauren Ewing, Robert Morris, and Dennis Oppenheim. Though the projects submitted were shown in museum space, at least four of the 29. Kracauer, "The Mass Ornament," trans. Barbara Correll and Zipes, New German Critique 5 (Spring 1975): 68. 30.

Hobsbawm draws an important distinction between spaces like the Ringstrasse in Vienna, which was to be read for its allegorical significance, and later spaces like Red Square in Moscow, the Sportpalast in Berlin, and the Velodrome d'Hiver in Paris, which made their impact through human ornamentation. His analysis of sports events, public holidays, and monumental constructions parallels that of Kracauer.

In fact, Acconci's most recent show, at the Museum of Modern Art, was called "Public Places.""' Most of the instal- lations in the Hirshhorn show attempt to represent public places as well, thus illustrating how the relationship of sculpture to public space has been turned inside out. The sculpture is no longer an object installed in the center of a public space; public space has instead become the subject, and thus the centerpiece, of the sculpture. Perhaps the most revealing of these works is Acconci's Fan City. As many as sixteen people work together to put this construction through its paces. As they manipulate it, nylon banners unfold to form a series of tents and an aluminum silhouette rises to the ceiling. On one hand, then, the piece seems to evoke revolutionary projects like Duveyrier's, in which collaboration results in the elevation of an ideal individual whose freedom is the principle that unifies the community. On the other hand, however, the banners reveal when unfurled a series of epithets: "Beggars," "Cripples," "Blacks," "Aliens," and so on. As Howard Fox says in his catalogue of the exhibition, in Fan City "everybody is an outcast."" Collaboration, in this case, produces divi- sion and thus negates itself. The aluminum figure may then represent a false ideal created by the expulsion of everyone who does not fit a predetermined stereotype. The piece is apparently meant to criticize a kind of unacknowl- edged prejudice that is exposed when the viewer, despite his or her efforts, waves a banner bearing an offensive term. In this it resembles another Acconci piece, a swing surrounded by a collapsed house deco- rated with stars and stripes. When the viewer sits in the swing, the house rises into place, revealing to those outside, but not to the one inside, a hammer and sickle. In both cases, the viewer is made to wave the flag of a faith he or she may not share. Though these pieces rely on the viewer's initiative, and on collaboration between one viewer and others, the viewer is in fact entirely helpless in the hands of the sculp- tor. If these pieces are meant to expose the power of cultural stereotypes, they do so only by exerting the artist's power over the viewer. Acconci describes these works in terms of captivity or victimiza- tion: "By becoming active, the person becomes the victim of a cultural sign.""33 But the irony redounds on Acconci himself because it thwarts 31.

The rest of the Hirshhorn exhibition reveals in a variety of forms a very similar situation. Works that attempt to enclose a community within the space of the sculpture wind up looking almost like prisons. For example, only the most benign social values motivate the work of Siah Armajani. His goal is to build "'open, available, useful, low, near, common, public gathering places. Gathering places which are neighborly' " (M, p. 38). Thus he has specialized in artistic transfigura- tions of American vernacular forms such as log cabins, covered bridges, and Shaker meetinghouses. Armajani's project for the Hirshhorn exhi- bition was a lounge for the museum employees, carried out largely in bare pine. Nothing could be further, it seems, from the installation constructed by Lauren Ewing, who, like Alice Aycock, has been work- ing for some time in fanciful representations of institutional buildings. Having already created a library and a powerhouse, Ewing installed at the Hirshhorn a Benthamite prison, in which a cylindrical guard tower and a bullhorn confront a curved cellblock. Ewing is interested in some- thing called "'infrapsychic molding'" (M, p. 55), and this work vividly and simply represents the political situation Kracauer denounced in "The Mass Ornament." The identical cellblock windows bespeak the regimented uniformity of modern life, while the curved facade keeps each individual equidistant from the center of power, the upright guard tower, and thus within range of surveillance and propaganda. To enter Armajani's carefully disordered jumble of benches and stools is to inhabit a metaphor of the Heavenly City, where freedom and security magically coincide. To walk through the dead space between Ewing's guard tower and her cellblock is to become one of the mass ornaments of a totalitarian state. Thus the Hirshhorn exhibition seems to juxtapose the two extremes that can be touched when the experience of public space becomes the object of art, when the public becomes a sculpture. But there are a number of interesting similarities between the two. Both rely on simple monochrome shapes without detail or ornamentation. In Armajani's case these simplicities denote a modest populism, while in Ewing's work they indicate the bleak puritanism of the total state. Both works use language, for Armajani a poem by Walt Whitman, for Ewing 34. Quoted in Sayre, The Object ofPerformance, p. 6. 35.

In both cases, the lettering is posted quite high up, though a small part of the Whitman quotation does run along the baseboard of Armajani's room. Ewing's letters are meant, in their size and position, to represent the kind of language that might come out of the bullhorn, a stencil of which is painted as part of the title, but it is hard to tell why Armajani should have elevated Whitman's poem. Armajani, like Ewing, is fond of stencilled lettering, a form that has a kind of popular anonymity in his case and a threatening, official anonymity in hers. These similarities indicate that the two projects, seemingly so different, are in fact linked, however ironically. The artistic devices Armajani chooses to evoke an ideal communitarian life can also be used, as Ewing's installation shows, in the very totalitarian spaces from which he recoils. The very techniques he chooses to represent commonality can also represent the conformity that Ewing means to expose. These similarities suggest that in attempting to provide a communal experience, Armajani ironically provides what already exists in suffocating abundance, public spaces that take the public in hand. Though Armajani's seating is arranged in a pattern of quite pleasant disorder, which is clearly meant to represent the free and easy social relations that should occur in the space, a close look reveals that the seating is fixed in place, so that the users of the room are condemned to enjoy just this particular disorder, as they are condemned to enjoy the openness of Whitman's verse, even if they prefer John Milton or Ogden Nash. The relationship between Armajani and Ewing exposes the ambig- uous nature of contemporary attempts to make sculpture public by making the public part of the sculpture. These works contain the same unpleasant surprise found inside Fan City, a package promising a communal meeting place that opens to reveal an alienating regimenta- tion. Some of the public discomfort with contemporary public sculpture may come therefore from a feeling that there is not much to choose between the role offered to it in the real versions of spaces like Ewing's prison and that offered by art, if even the works that promise the Heav- enly City turn their viewers into human ornaments. Yet the history of these metaphors suggests that the process might be reversed again and their original promise realized. Two final examples indicate how sculp- ture might use public space in a different way. These two works, Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial and Hans Haacke's Und ihr habt doch gesiegt, seem on the surface to have nothing to do with one another. One is the well-known double slash of black polished granite, the other a temporary installation in Graz, Austria that reproduced, fifty years after the fact, a Nazi monument.

More important, both works place their viewers in a public space that is articulated in terms of political controversy so that to view the piece is not simply to experience space but also to enter a debate. Lin and Haacke both deftly situate their works so as to expose spatial relationships that are also historical and political. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial materializes at the intersection of an angle described by the monuments to Washington and Lincoln. If it thus places the Vietnam War in a symmetrical relationship to the rest of American history, it also suspends it between a symbol of unity, the great obelisk whose many blocks signify E pluribus unum, and a symbol of discord, Lincoln brooding over the Civil War.36 The two wings of the memorial seem almost to represent two sides of a conflict, two positions in an argument, two ways of looking at the war. A spatial configuration thus reveals a historical irony or doubleness, just as Haacke's obelisk reveals beneath the contemporary geography of Graz another geogra- phy, precisely fifty years old, studded with swastikas and Nazi slogans. Like his Nazi predecessor, but with quite different motives, Haacke covered the Column of the Virgin Mary in Graz's main street with a cloth-and-wood obelisk, and he placed on it the motto ("And You Were Victorious after All") that had come in fifty years to have an extremely 36.

Yet this act completed the irony, since destroying the monument in 1988 served exactly the same inter- ests that erected it in 1938. Silence and ignorance work now as triumphal militarism did then. Both works achieve their aesthetic distinction and their emotional power from their political complexity. The common dogma that public monuments depend on public agreement is belied by these works, which show instead that monuments achieve a public resonance by taking up topics too important for agreement. Lin's granite walls repre- sent the course of the Vietnam War from its secret beginnings to its final, unspectacular end, growing and growing and then dwindling away again. The memorial thus depicts the shape of a war determined first by secrecy and then by public opposition. Without in any way denigrating the death of the soldiers whose names are carved in the granite, Lin also creates a monument to debate and controversy. Haacke cannot commemorate debate, since the erection of the original obelisk was part of an artistic and military demonstration designed to cow opposition. As Werner Fenz, organizer of the exhibition that included Haacke's work, observed, "It was precisely the use of art in public spaces that, under the Nazis, was subject to a finely worked-out system of strict ideological rules.""38 But in reerecting the obelisk, Haacke attempts to turn this project inside out, to expose the way the Nazis used public space to brutalize the public, and thus turn mass ornamentation against itself. The two works both make the public part of the sculpture itself, but they do so in ways that work against mass ornamentation. Part of the power of Lin's memorial comes from the sheer extent of the space that is covered by the names of the dead. But if the dead make their impression through sheer bulk, that bulk has power because the viewer is forced to realize that each name represents a once-living individual. Since the names are listed by date of death and not by rank or military unit, the dead are presented as individuals and not as members of a group. The memorial thus overcomes the anonymity of the body count and concentrates an almost insupportable emotion in the space between each individual and the mass of fifty-eight thousand. But the living public also enters the work, reflected as it is in the highly polished gran- 37.

In fact, Donald Kunze has recently pointed out that the two wings of the piece reflect one another and in so doing create another V in virtual space behind the actual one, forming a huge ghostly X at the very center of which the reflections of the public enter the virtual space that seems to exist in the earth behind the memorial.s9 Living and dead confront one another within the sculpture in a space neither living nor dead. In this way, the sculpture superimposes the living public on the dead, giving rise to a variety of emotions from shame to reconciliation to pride, all of which are far more complex and full of conflict than anything evoked by the all-too-obvious bronze troopers. Haacke's obelisk makes similar use of the public. In 1938, the obe- lisk had an important role in a major Nazi spectacle in which massed individuals in and out of uniform played the same aesthetic role as the massed flags and banners lining the streets. When the work was re- created, the streets around it were filled again, only this time with argument. In this, Haacke managed to realize the ambition of some of his earliest conceptual pieces, which were based on opinion polls taken at various museums. In those early works, public opinion became the work of art, which Haacke materialized in one case by making a street map out of photographs of the residences of people who had visited his show at the Howard Wise Gallery in New York.40 But the public in this "sculpture" was still inert, and the polling methods, which were at least partially satirical, still reduced their human material to the same kinds of categories used in other marketing. In Graz, on the other hand, the public was animated, and most of the power of the work lay in the different effects the same aesthetic object had in its two different instal- lations. Just as in Lin's memorial, the living and the dead faced each other across an aesthetic space, which was charged with the same hardly reconcilable feelings. Like the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, Haacke's work manages to superimpose one public space on another and in so doing suggests a community whose nature is open to question, whose history presents certain alternatives for choice. A monument like this does not represent the continuity of the present with the past but rather the chance, through an awakened public opinion, to break a dependence on the past reinforced by silence. Such works help us discover what separates the original meaning of the public as sculpture from its autocratic applications. In its ancient form, the metaphor signified the voluntary association of different 39. Donald Kunze, "Architecture as Reading; Virtuality, Secrecy, Monstrosity," Journal of Architectural Education 41 (Summer 1988): 28. Kunze claims that this virtual space is not "cultural" but perceptual and in so doing undermines the usefulness of his argument. 40. See Hans Haacke: Unfinished Business, ed. Brian Wallis (Cambridge, Mass., 1986), pp. 78-79.</page><page sequence="20">Critical Inquiry Summer 1990 879 individuals in a common public forum. In the liberal form introduced at the end of the eighteenth century, the metaphor did not stand simply for agreement, commonality, or continuity, but rather for debate; it signified a space in which different opinions could meet and contend according to commonly accepted rules. In these works by Lin and Haacke, it is not the public experience of space but rather public debate that becomes a work of art. They make manifest an important truth about public space, that unless it is embedded in a larger public sphere that values debate, a public sphere like that defined by Jiirgen Haber- mas in which private people use their reason to discuss and reach conclusions, then it will always be decorated by mass ornaments, no matter what sort of art is put into it.41 Works like Fan City or Auto-Plas- tique suggest that such a sphere does not now exist in our entirely regimented society, but this very criticism implies that the artist has achieved the independence necessary to reflection. If this autonomy could be seen not as the antithesis of, but rather as an analogy for, the freedom of the individual viewer, then art might renew public space instead of merely decorating it with mass ornaments. 41.
