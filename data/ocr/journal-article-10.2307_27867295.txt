Children's Literature and Political Animals AS WITH CONTEMPORARY CHILDREN'S LITERATURE, THE CHILDREN'S LITER .ature of the late eighteenth century was written for two audiences: the adults whose approval of the works determined whether they would be purchased in the first place, and the children whose enjoyment of the works determined whether they would continue to be purchased in the fu ture. This dual audience?combined with the fact that children's literature is a genre defined more by its audience than by internal characteristics? complicates the task of literary criticism considerably, as evidenced by a re cent schism among critics of late eighteenth-century children's literature. Some have argued that "children's books remained apolitical in the 1790s"1 or that the political tendency of 1790s children's literature is overwhelm ingly that of an anti-Jacobin, conservative middle-class.2 Others read the children's literature of the 1790s as "part of the political assault on aristo .

Grenby's essay offers a useful correction to arguments that overstate the case for a radical children's literature in the 1790s, though he himself overstates his case by restricting his concept of the politically engaged work to what can only be called propaganda. A text need not explicitly take sides on a par ticular political debate in order to be considered politically charged. 2.

Those competing concepts were independently ar ticulated in 1802, only months apart, by Charles Lamb and Sarah Trimmer. In a letter to Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lamb argues that the didacticism of recent children's literature impairs the imagination and independent think ing of children. He singles out Anna Barbauld's works as particularly egre gious: "Knowledge, insignificant and vapid as Mrs B-'s books convey, it seems must come to a child in the shape of knowledge. "5 Sarah Trimmer, however, argues in the first issue of The Guardian of Education that recent works of children's literature are not didactic enough. These works "are re plete with hidden mischief" because of their adherence to Rousseau's invidious principle of "deferring religious instruction beyond the stages of infancy and childhood, that young people might afterwards with unpreju 3?

Lamb's primary point, it should be noted, is that recent chil dren's literature eschews a masculine fantasy world for a feminized and trivialized realism, but this aspect of Lamb's letter has been thoroughly addressed by other critics, as in Norma Clarke's " 'The Cursed Barbauld Crew': Women Writers and Writing for Children in the Late Eighteenth Century," in Opening the Nursery Door: Reading, Writing and Childhood 1600 1Q00, ed.

The question leads us back to the dual audience of children's literature. Perhaps most significantly, the duality is written into a defining motif of children's literature: the depiction and discussion of non-human animals.7 Often overlooked as merely a generic marker, the animals of children's lit erature destabilize the meaning of texts by naturalizing the concept of hier archy at the same time that they invite sympathetic identification with the animal as an alienated subject. An analysis of the depictions of animals in children's literature is therefore crucial to understanding the ambiguity of a genre which is written not only to appeal to children, but also to shape them.8 Lamb and Trimmer themselves suggest that depictions of animals offer a useful site of access to the multiple meanings of children's literature, as their contrasting perspectives on children's literature paraUels their contrasting rhetorical use of animals in discussing that literature. Lamb suggests there is an offensive "conceit" in the elaboration of human difference from animals in children's literature of his time. He accuses Barbauld's works of corrupt ing "all that is human in man and child," and complains that a child's "empty noddle must be turned with conceit of his own powers when he has learnt that a horse is an animal, and Billy is better than a horse" (81?82). Lamb refers here to Barbauld's story, "A Lesson in the Art of Distin guishing" from Evenings at Home (1792-1796), a Platonic dialogue in which a father instructs his son in the method of Linnaean taxonomy, but his in terpretation of the story as a straightforward assertion of human superiority to animals ignores much of its ambiguity (as I discuss below). Trimmer, for her part, views in the same literature a dangerous blurring of difference be tween humans and animals. With the authority of having written the most famous work of children's literature of the late eighteenth century with a focus on animals, Fabulous Histories (1786), Trimmer repeatedly takes strong 6.

To avoid the awkwardness of repeating "non-human animals," I refer to non-human animals simply as "animals" for the remainder of this article, even though humans, of course, are a type of animal. 8. As Mary Jackson argues, "at every point in its early history, children's literature was rooted in the conditions and imperatives of the adult world and was regarded first and fore most as a tool to shape the young to the needs of their world. If we would truly understand what it is 'about,' we must master both its overt and hidden texts, its plain statements as well as its tacitly understood messages and veiled directives" (xi).</page><page sequence="4">644 DARREN HOWARD exception to works like Samuel Jackson Pratt's Pity's Gift: a Collection of In teresting Tales, to Excite the Compassion of Youth for the Animal Creation (1798). Trimmer agrees with the basic purpose of Pratt's work, "to teach children lessons of compassion towards the dumb creation, " but insists that "a line of distinction should be carefully drawn, lest the best affections of the heart being called forth at an early age to inferior objects, should rest there, and be eventually withheld from those who have a higher claim to them" (1: 304). Trimmer's hierarchical ordering of the natural world ech oes and supports a social hierarchy with "a line of distinction" between "higher" orders and "inferior objects."9 The politics of children's literature is inextricable from the way the genre depicts animals. Both Lamb and Trimmer suggest that Anna Barbauld's works are impor tant examples of what they criticize: Lamb by focusing his outrage on "the cursed Barbauld crew, those blights &amp; blasts of all that is human in man and child" (81), and Trimmer by devoting a large portion of her Guardian of Education to Barbauld's works and by associating Barbauld's books with others that are "expressly designed to sow the seeds of infidelity, and of every bad principle, in the minds of the rising generation" (1: 64). Bar bauld's status as a representative of recent children's literature is partly based on the popular assumption that she was the primary author of one of the most significant works of children's literature of the 1790s, the anony mously published Evenings at Home; or, the Juvenile Budget Opened (1792 1796), though much of the six-volume work was written by her brother John Aikiri.10 The object of much praise, Evenings at Home was the most ambitious work of original children's literature of the 1790s and found im 9? Trimmer further draws a connection between anthropomorphism and republicanism by interweaving her discussion of both faults in her review of Louis Francois Jauffret's Visits to the Menagerie: This work is certainly less exceptionable than many children's books of French extrac tion, though it is not entirely free from the leaven which ferments throughout the gen eral system. The Professor of botany, and the Keeper of the wild beasts are here called citizens. We read of the moral powers, and qualities, and even of the pious affections of lions, elephants, monkies, dogs, birds, &amp;c; of the foresight of animals and of flowers. The sensibility of the young reader is sometimes called forth for the distresses of ani mals as if the creatures themselves felt the sorrows of humanity; and the Keeper mourns for the death of his Lion, as for a wife or a child; nor has the author omitted to recom mend Republicanism, (i: 201) Jauffret's literary crime lies in his willingness to blur the lines of distinction between classes and species, and Trimmer almost conflates the two categories when she caps her list of Jauffret's errors by noting his Republicanism. 10. Aikin was known to have some hand in the work, but it seems likely that the work should be considered as a product of collaboration rather than of single authorship.

Trimmer's review of Evenings at Home mixes praise with caution for what she reads as dangerously Republican sentiments implied in the work's depiction of various animals: "The Rookery," for example, conveys a "les son o? Republicanism" in the guise of natural history because of its depiction of animals who "associate upon the principle of obtaining some benefit for the whole body, not to give particular advantages to a few"; another story, "The Mouse, the Lap-dog, and the Monkey," according to Trimmer, "will impress [children's] minds with a prejudice against the higher orders of so ciety" (2: 307?8).12 On the other hand, Trimmer objects to "The History and Adventures of a Cat" only because it blurs the boundary between hu mans and animals (2: 308). A work of children's literature that challenges the distinction between humans and animals makes a covertly Republican argument, in Trimmer's eyes, by encouraging the transgression of social boundaries. She recommends that children only be allowed to read Eve nings at Home "[ujnder the care of a judicious parent or teacher," because, if left to themselves, 'to read it over and over again in their leisure hours,' to ruminate upon all its contents, without discrimination, it may prove very injurious. . . . Let us 'Take heed, and beware!' (2: 353) Trimmer's parting admonition to "Take heed, and beware" is entirely sin cere about the threat that children's literature can pose. Trimmer argues elsewhere that "it is more consistent with the public interests at large to ed ucate children to be contented with the laws and long established customs of their ancestors, than to raise desires in their minds which, if generally in culcated, would probably lead to a revolution in government" (1: 265). The parent who leaves a child alone with Evenings at Home, Trimmer sug gests, may be sowing the seeds of a revolution. Depictions of animals have largely been seen in recent criticism of early children's literature as amenable to conservative, anti-Jacobin arguments. Andrew O'Malley argues that depictions of animals evolved from "an en tertaining fantasy element" in mid-eighteenth-century works like Goody Two-Shoes into "symbolic examples of the lower orders expressing con tentment with their lot in life or as objects upon whom children can prac 11. Evenings at Home was reprinted four times within the first four years after its initial publication, and continued to be frequently republished over the course of the nineteenth century. See Aileen Fyfe's article for its nineteenth-century popularity 12. Note that Trimmer's objections are not, as Grenby argues, simply against the politicization of children's literature?they are quite specifically against what she sees as Re publican ideas appearing in children's literature.</page><page sequence="6">646 DARREN HOWARD tice their budding virtue of charity" in the late eighteenth-century works of Sarah Trimmer and Mary Ann Kilner.13 Christine Kenyon-Jones agrees that "the injunction to be kind to animals, like that of being kind to ser vants and other inferiors, is a part of teaching the (essentially upper-class male) child its place in the social hierarchy" (57). Tess Cosslett pays more attention to the carnivalesque inversion of authority that often attends ani mal narratives, writing that "stories for children about animals are implicitly taking a perspective from 'lower' down this hierarchy, and this can have the effect of upsetting its terms."14 Cosslett suggests such inversions are temporary, however, because "hierarchical social ideas are often reinstated when we find there is a 'natural' hierarchy among the animals themselves, with different species standing for different classes" (2). The admonition to be kind to animals is therefore a condescending and superficial gesture of subversion, while the presence of animals in children's literature funda mentally reinforces ideas of hierarchy. The function of animals in children's literature is, however, more com plex than O'Malley, Kenyon-Jones, and Cosslett acknowledge. Evenings at Home approaches animals through multiple genres?fable, natural history, rural tales, animal "autobiography," and stories about India and Africa? each of which sheds a unique light on discourses about colonialism, politi cal power, the epistemology and ethics of science, gender and racial differ ence, and the relationship between humans and the natural world. Most importantly, the depictions of animals suggest a radically pluralistic notion of objectivity by requiring readers, who must take on the position of vari ous animals, to sift through and recognize the validity of heterogeneous perspectives and value-systems. Evenings at Home uses the child's identifica tion with animals?already a traditional trope in children's literature?to invoke a critical model of reading in which the child comes to inhabit the animal's alienated stance and to observe from the vantage of the animal the society which they are being trained to enter. The work deliberately nur tures contradictions and fissures within subjectivity so as to create a more dynamic, less homogeneous society. The animal is transformed in Evenings at Home from a reflexive generic marker for children's literature into a dialogical tool for training children to be social critics. 13- Andrew O'Malley, "The Coach and Six" 39, . .

Teaching Animals How to Be Human The duality of children's literature grows out of the eighteenth century dual conception of children as both human and animal. When Words worth refers to the "glad animal movements" of his "boyish days" (lines 73?74) in Tintern Abbey, he is merely echoing a common notion of child hood, growing out of the idea that "[i]nfants are exactly in the same condi tion with brutes, " as William Smellie (the scientist and editor of the first Encyclopaedia Britannica) writes, summing up the popular as well as the scientific view of children in the 1790s.15 Eighteenth-century pedagogical theory emphasizes the importance of training the child to dominate his or her animal instincts with rationality, implicitly conceptualizing education as the eradication of animality from the child. The goal of eighteenth-century education is thus a subjectivity contained with the same techniques of domination and control that characterize the colonial project. The child's status as a liminal human differs from that of other objects of domination, however, in that the child (or at least the male child) is capable of achiev ing, in time, a state of full humanity. Over the course of the eighteenth century the process of becoming fully human came to be increasingly thought of as far from an inevitable side-effect of aging, and the prolifera tion of schools and educational materials reflects a growing emphasis on the necessity of education for achieving the complete demarcation of the hu man from the animal. Children's literature, explicitly theorized as an edu cational tool, bore the same goals. The child is alternately objectified as an animal, granted the subjectivity of a human, or both: seen as an animal object en route to becoming a hu man subject. In John Locke's Some Thoughts Concerning Education (1693), the foundational text of eighteenth-century pedagogical theory, the child figures as the site of an opposition between nature and reason in which na ture is more powerful. Children, Locke writes, are "guided more by Self love, than Reason or Reflection."16 The parent "governs" the child, and children must be "obedient" to their parents, who are their "Lords, their Absolute Governors," until the children can govern themselves (109). This results in a theory of education that emphasizes the parent's domination of the child until the child internalizes that domination and becomes a self 15- William Smelile, The Philosophy of Natural History (Dublin: printed by William Porter, for Chamberlain? and Rice, W.

That which must be regulated, in this model of subjec tivity, are the animal instincts. Locke's ideal student learns "to deny him self his own Desires, cross his own Inclinations, and purely follow what Reason directs as best, tho' the appetite lean the other way" (103). Lockean education?the cornerstone of classical liberalism?both models itself on, and is a model for, forms of political power that strive to control an unruly, "brutish" populace. In Emile (1762), Jean-Jacques Rousseau is also interested in the child's animal-like physicality, asserting that "[children's first sensations are purely affective . . . they perceive only pleasure and pain."17 Rousseau appears to offer a contrast to Lockean education when he introduces the idea of the (male) child's subjectivity and the benefits of his having freedom to form his own opinions: "Prepare from afar the reign of his freedom and the use of his forces," Rousseau advises, "by putting him in the condition always to be master of himself and in all things to do his will, as soon as he has one" (63). Yet the freedom of Emile, his paradigmatic child, is illusory. Rousseau seeks to control the child's experiences invisibly in order to in culcate specific patterns of thought. Emile learns the Lockean lessons of self-denial and self-control through a circumscribed physical freedom and staged social interactions. The intended product of this education is a con fident and capable imperialist: one who knows how "to preserve himself as a man, to bear the blows of fate, to brave opulence and poverty, to live, if he has to, in freezing Iceland or on Malta's burning rocks" (42). As the reader learns in the second half of Emile, the first object of his pupil's con quest will be his wife. Thus Rousseau's goals for education are in the end similar to Locke's, and in fact exceed Locke's desire to control the child by insisting that the child should not be aware that the tutor is manipulating his experiences. While Locke and Rousseau do articulate to some extent a sense of the difference between humans and animals as one of degree, rather than an absolute boundary,18 the goal of their educational projects remains the distinction of the human from the animal through the cultiva tion of rationality and a capacity for self-denial. The centrality of the animal in the pedagogical aims of Locke and Rous seau carry over to children's literature. Rousseau's influence is only indirect \ . Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Emile, or On Education, trans. Allan Bloom (New York: Basic Books, 1979) 62. 18. Rousseau, for example, writes, "Even animals acquire much. They have senses; they have to learn to make use of them. They have needs; they have to learn to provide for them. They have to learn how to eat, to walk, to fly. . . . Everything is learning for animate and sensitive beings" (62). Like animals, children do have a "kind of reason . . . they reason very well in everything they know that relates to their immediate and palpable interest" (108).</page><page sequence="9">(DIS)OBEDIENCE IN EVENINGS AT HOME 649 because he famously claims that "[r]eading is the plague of childhood" (116) and prescribes "[n]o book other than the world, no instruction other than that of facts" (168). Locke, in contrast, gives reading an important place in education, and animals a central role in reading. He sees the child as inherently fascinated by animals, so that the only works he deems "fit to engage the liking of Children, and tempt them to read" are Aesop's fables and the medieval fable of Reynard the Fox (212). He recommends that "as soon as [a child] begins to spell, as many Pictures of Animals should be got him, as can be found, with the printed names to them" (212). Anticipating late eighteenth-century concerns, Locke argues that children ought to be discouraged from harming animals not only for the sake of the animals themselves, but even more because "the custom of tormenting and killing of Beasts, will, by degrees, harden their Minds even towards Men; and they who delight in the suffering and destruction of inferior Creatures, will not be apt to be very compassionate or benign to those of their own kind" (180). For Locke, the implications of animal cruelty extend to broad ques tions of morality: Children should from the beginning be bred up in an abhorrence of killing, or tormenting any living Creature . . . unless it be for the pres ervation or advantage of some other, that is Nobler. . . . And indeed, I think People should be accustomed, from their Cradles, to be tender to all sensible Creatures, and to spoil or waste nothing at all. (180-81) As Locke's incipient theory of moral sensibility suggests that the basis of morality is the recognition of the subjectivity of others,19 the broader im plications of kindness to animals extends immediately to "Civility in their Language, and Deportment, towards their Inferiours and the meaner sort of People, particularly Servants" (182). The social standing of animals and servants is nearly equal in that progression, and becomes even more clear when Locke endorses a hierarchy which allows for the destruction of animals?and, by extension, all "inferiors,"?"for the preservation or ad vantage of some other that is nobler" (180). The connection between ani mals and children is thus invested with a duality even as early as Locke's treatise: it suggests an egalitarian ethic of radical sympathy at the same time that it is used to demonstrate the origins of hierarchy in nature. The role of animals as mirrors for children thus remains vexed by the premise that edu cation involves the eradication of similarities between children and animals. 19- Evan Thompson, "Empathy and Consciousness," in E. Thompson, ed. Between Our selves: Second-Person Issues in the Study of Consciousness (Thorverton: Imprint Academic, 2001) 1-32.</page><page sequence="10">650 DARREN HOWARD 3. Writing Animals for Children When a body of literature written for children does develop in the eigh teenth century, animals function much as Locke forecast. They are integral to the genre, often being such a powerful generic marker that even works that were not written for children but which foreground animals?such as Charles Perrault's Histoires ou contes du temps pass? (1697), which soon be came better known by its animal-foregrounding subtitle, Contes de la Mere VOye (Tales of Mother Goose), Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels (1726), and the fables of Aesop, La Fontaine, John Dry den, and John Gay?be came popular works for children. In Isaac Watts' Divine Songs for Children (1715), such poems as "Against Quarrelling and Fighting," and "Innocent Play," assume that the child will identify with animals, and use that identi fication to encourage the child to identify not with quarrelsome animals, like bears, lions, and dogs, but rather with the pacific lamb. Animals in these works, however, are often merely symbolic of particular human vices or virtues, without retaining any sense of their otherness as animals. In Jeanne Marie LePrince De Beaumont's "Beauty and the Beast" (1756), for example, the otherness of the beast is revealed to be ultimately superficial, as beneath the beast lies a handsome prince. Rather than suggesting the subjectivity of animals, or the moral equivalence of animals and humans, Beaumont's story is much more interested in the behavior of men, and in women's perception of men, as "brutish." As the genre of children's literature matured over the course of the eigh teenth century, depictions of animals became increasingly imbued with a sense of otherness, and sometimes even with subjectivity and interiority, alongside increasingly frequent and impassioned passages urging kindness to animals. The attitude toward animals of most eighteenth century works is dominantly paternalistic, anxious to reserve a sense of human superiority to animals and never allowing their subjectivity to be broached without an explicit sense of fantasy or irony. Human dominion over and possession of animals are asserted, but the emphasis on dominion and possession sits un easily next to the assumption of a child's sympathetic identification with animals. Among the many conventions of eighteenth-century children's literature that The History of Goody Two-Shoes (1765) inaugurates is a focus on the in telligence and sensibility of animals, along with exhortations to refrain from hurting them. The work repeatedly gives proof of animal intelligence, as Goody teaches a raven "to speak, to spell and to read," and a pigeon "to spell and read, though not to talk. "20 These accomplishments are presented 20. Anonymous, The History of Little Goody Two-Shoes; Otherwise Called Mrs. Margery Two-Shoes (London: T. Carnan and F. Newbery, 1772) 70-71.</page><page sequence="11">(DIS)OBEDIENCE IN EVENINGS AT HOME 651 as the natural results of industriousness?a lesson the child is to apply to him or herself The child is urged to be kind to animals less out of respect for their subjectivity than out of gratitude for their usefulness. The narrator lists the ways in which the child is physically dependent on the labor and sacrifice of animals: Does not the Horse and the Ass carry you and your burthens; don't the Ox plough your Ground, the Cow give you Milk, the Sheep cloath your Back, the Dog watch your House, the Goose, find you in Quills to write with, the Hen bring Eggs for your Custards and Pud dings, and the Cock call you up in the Morning, when you are lazy, and like to hurt yourselves by laying too long in Bed? If so, how can you be so cruel to them, and abuse God Almighty's good Creatures? (Goody 104-5) Goody's emphasis on the animal as a domestic servant legitimizes the social order as a natural order, shutting down the social implications of animals who can feel, speak, read, and think. The need to be kind to animals in ex change for their labor establishes a model of class relations as well?a model of magnanimous condescension and toleration. Animals continue to function as emblems of the poor in such works as Thomas Percival's A Father's Instruction (1775?1777), Arnaud Berquin's L'Ami des Enfants (1782?1783; translated into English in 1786), and Berna din de Saint-Pierre's Paul and Virginia (1788). These works frequently re mind children of both their superiority to animals and their duty to be kind to them. Children ought to feel for animals, but not too much, as in Sarah Fielding's The Governess (1749), where a mother warns her daughter against grieving excessively for her dead cat: Now tho' I have always encouraged you in all Sentiments of Good nature and Compassion; and am sensible, that where those Sentiments are strongly implanted, they will extend their Influence even to the least Animal; yet you are to consider, my Child, that you are not to give way to any Passions that interfere with your Duty: For whenever there is any Contention between your Duty and your Inclinations, you must conquer the latter, or become wicked and contemptible.21 An excess of feeling for animals, the mother implies, renders the child more like an animal. The need to distance oneself from animals marks the limit of one's duty to sympathize with others, so that animals appear in mid eighteenth century children's literature to confirm and help define the boundaries between social classes. 21. Sarah Fielding, The Governess (Dublin: A Bradley, and R. James, 1749) 20.</page><page sequence="12">652 DARREN HOWARD The 1780S saw the appearance of four enormously popular works for children in which the child's identification with animals is simultaneously strengthened and broken. Mary Ann Kilner's The Life and Perambulations of a Mouse (1783?1784) is a tongue-in-cheek autobiography of a mouse as dictated to a human narrator who interrupts the narrative at crucial mo ments to declare the impossibility of a mouse speaking, referring to "my little make-believe companion,"22 and thereby diminishing the potential subversiveness offered by the mouse's perspective on the humans who rou tinely persecute him. Similarly, Thomas Day's The History of Sandford and Merton (1783?1787) and Mary Wollstonecraft's Original Stories for Children (1787) suggest that the injunction to treat animals kindly derives not from a degree of moral equivalence between humans and animals, but from hu man superiority and difference from animals. The most famous and influential work of children's literature of the 1780S was Sara Trimmer's Fabulous Histories, Designed for the Instruction of Children, Respecting their Treatment of Animals (1786), which tells the story of a family of robins in order to encourage her readers "to shew compassion to the Animal Creation" without "fallfing] into the contrary fault of immod erate tenderness to them."23 Mrs. Benson repeatedly reminds her children "that there are poor people as well as poor birds," highlighting the connection between animals and the lower classes {Fabulous Histories 7-8). Christine Kenyon-Jones notes that Trimmer, along with Hannah More, "used the difference between humans and animals as a way of teaching children the between social classes, and as a source of injunctions to those in all ranks of society to be satisfied with their lot" (57-58). As Andrew O'Mal ley argues, the family of robins offers a clear parallel to depictions of re spectable lower class families, with their work ethic, contentment with simple pleasures, cleanliness and propriety, so that Fabulous Histories propa gates the impression that "[respectability in poverty can, according to the middle-class ideology of the age, be accomplished by abiding by the ideol ogy without reaping its benefits."24 As in Kilner's Perambulations, Trimmer stresses the impossibility of speaking animals in her introduction, which ex plains that the stories ought to be read "not as containing the real conversa tions of Birds, (for that it is impossible we should ever understand,) but as a series of fables, intended to convey moral instruction" {Fabulous Histories 22.

Still, the lesson Fabulous Histories stresses the most is, as O'Malley argues, that "[tjreating one's inferiors with kind ness is not only a matter of Christian duty, it is a way of maximizing their utility and productivity, a lesson, of course, that can be applied with equal success to both human and animal labor" (52-53). Trimmer's work thus uses animals to form a model simultaneously for both the pedagogical and imperial project. Day's emphasis on imaginative sympathy with the animal, along with Kilner's and Trimmer's adoption of animal narrators who observe human society from an alienated vantage point, offer mere hints at the potential of animals as a device for social criticism. Day, Kilner, and Trimmer disrupt the child's identification with animals as part of the larger educational proj ect of self-discipline, which requires conceiving of animals as a negative model. The depiction of animals is thus as contradictory as the concept of the child: the child is told he or she can identify with animals, yet ought to strive to be less of an animal. Children's literature thus develops into a site for exploring the identity crisis of the enlightenment, which defines the human as an animal whose difference from other animals lies in its self definition as not-animal. 4. Revolutionary Animals Evenings at Home does not immediately strike the reader as a radical depar ture from these earlier works for children. Like many of them, it uses an episodic narrative to preach the virtues of self-sufficiency, sympathy, and usefulness to one's community. Within its one hundred short pieces, how ever, it departs from its predecessors in its refusal to ironize the subjectivity of animals. Where Kilner and Trimmer only adopt the perspective of ani mals while noting the impossibility of animals actually speaking, Evenings at Home presents animal narrators alongside human narrators without com ments. That refusal creates a dual perspective, at once human and animal, which is key to Evenings at Home's development of children's literature as a form of social critique. The reader's identification with both humans and animals subverts the traditional educational goal of internalized domination by fostering an alienated critical perspective on society, even while it pre pares the child to function in that society. Recent articles by Daniel White, Penny Mahon, Aileen Fyfe, and Michelle Levy establish the importance of Evenings at Home as one of the most popular works written for children in the 1790s and as a deliberate at 25- Dorothy Kilner's The Rational Brutes (1798) contains a similar disclaimer (6).</page><page sequence="14">654 DARREN HOWARD tempt to use children's literature for political and cultural change.26 These critics emphasize Evenings at Homes contribution to Dissenting arguments against militarism, slavery, the ideology of separate spheres, and the integra tion of religion with secular educational projects. Moving beyond discus sions of the work's content, Fyfe notes that the style of Evenings at Home is itself innovative and conducive to its political ends, and contrasts the dia logic pedagogical method o? Evenings at Home, where "the children were not merely passive receptacles for the teacher's knowledge . . . [but] thought for themselves," with the dialogues in Sarah Trimmer's Easy Intro duction to the Knowledge of Nature (1780), which "did not permit the chil dren to speak at any point" (469). Michelle Levy carries this stylistic analysis further, demonstrating how the frame narrative, the attribution of authorship, and the collaborative process with which Aikin and Barbauld wrote the pieces all contribute to the work's politically "radical education" by replacing a hierarchical con cept of authority with a more diffuse familial model (147). Central to Levy's argument is her analysis o? Evenings at Home's use of d?mystification to help its readers "become acquainted with the reality behind names and to make children (and their parents as well) into penetrating observers of their own society" (134). The clearest examples of the work's use of d?mystification are found in its discussions of war, which repeatedly draw back a veil of jingoistic nationalism and the intertwined discourses of mas culinity and war to reveal war as glorified murder in the cause of glorified robbery. As Levy notes, this idea is rarely forced on the reader didactically, but emerges organically in dialogues where the connection between myth and reality is only gradually revealed, and only through the critical insight of the child interlocutors.27 Through its use of d?mystification, Levy ar gues, Evening at Home "encouraged children (and of course their parents) to . . . become critical observers of and, where necessary, vocal resisters to au thority" by promoting active critical thinking over passive indoctrination (123). While d?mystification is an important element of Evenings at Home's pedagogical project, as an educational strategy it re-asserts the authority of the riddling adult and the inferiority of the child who must guess the adult's predetermined answer. The culmination of a demystifying work is the clar ity of single answers rather than the ambiguity of multiple perspectives. Evenings at Home instead makes more extensive use, and more effective use (politically and pedagogically) of demystification's opposite technique: 26.

Rather than beginning with the mysterious and remov ing its strangeness, many of the pieces begin with the familiar and make it strange by portraying it from a novel perspective. Many of the works that teach with d?mystification simultaneously edu cate through defamiliarization. "Traveller's Wonders," for example, first makes England seem strange by observing it through the eyes of an anthro pologically-minded newcomer before it demystifies the idea that other cul tures are strange simply because they are not familiar.28 Similarly, the d?mystification of war in "Things by Their Right Names" is preceded by the defamiliarization of war by describing it in terms which equate war to a "bloody murder" (i: 150). Through defamiliarization, the work as a whole suggests a radical epistemology in which there is no "becomfing] ac quainted with the reality behind names" (Levy 134) because reality is not fully accessible to individuals but only approachable through the consider ation of multiple perspectives. Since animals act simultaneously as an object of readerly identification and as a potentially critical perspective, the most persistent and profound use of defamiliarization appears in the work's treatment of animals. The dual perspective offered by animals affects one's reading of the whole work, but is expressed most economically in such stories as Barbauld's "The Young Mouse," in which a young mouse excitedly tells her mother that the owners of the home in which they live have built them a comfort able house, stocked with cheese, in a cupboard where they can be safe from the housecat. The child-reader is asked to identify with the child mouse, against humans, as the mouse's mother replies, "it is most happy that you did not go in, for this house is called a trap, and you would never have come out again, except to have been devoured, or put to death in some way or other . . . [t] hough man has not so fierce a look as a cat, he is as much our enemy, and has still more cunning" (1: 19?20). This story's depiction of a mousetrap as a deceptively welcoming house defamiliarizes the blithely destructive behavior of humans toward animals. Barbauld's story literalizes the mice, which remain a species of animal at the same time that they are victims of human society.29 Because it embeds "realistic" mice within a human world that is hostile to mice, the moral of "The Young Mouse" cannot be reduced simply to the danger of trusting appearances, a moral common to many fables, which it seems at first to share. Instead, the 28. John Aikin and Anna Barbauld, Evenings at Home (London: J. Johnson, 1792-1796) 1: 22-31. 29. Another piece in Evenings at Home, "Tit for Tat," drives this point home even more directly, telling of an elephant who revenges itself on a man who teases it and moralizes, "An Elephant, they say, has human feeling, / And full as well as we he knows / The diff'rence between words and blows, / Between horse-play and civil dealing" (3: 30).</page><page sequence="16">656 DARREN HOWARD story implies a critique of the human relationship with animals which reso nates on an even broader level when the child's identification with the mouse is taken into account, suggesting a critique of the typical adult rela tionship with children. From the perspective of "The Travelled Ant," humans are monstrous in terms of their scale (as a translation of how the adult world might appear to its child readers) and their inexplicable violence (as a translation of how the adult world treats children). The Travelled Ant, recently returned from a journey, describes a road as "a wide open plain," a carriage as "a prodigious rolling mountain," and a human as "one of those enormous two-legged animals, which often shake the ground over our heads, and put us into ter ror" (5: 103, no) The ant's-eye defamiliarization of such passages prepares us for the conclusion the ant has drawn from his travels: [I]t is the current opinion with us, that everything in this world was made for our use. Now I have seen such vast tracts not at all fit for our residence, and peopled with creatures so much larger and stronger than ourselves, that I cannot help being convinced that the Creator had in view their accommodation as well as ours, in making this world. (5: 115) As much as this moral echoes earlier eighteenth-century admonishments against pride, it also reflects back on the most vividly dramatic moment of the ant's entire journey, which describes the destruction of an ant colony by humans: I saw the whole of their settlement blown into the air, with a prodi gious explosion of fire and smoke. Numbers of half-burnt bodies, to gether with the ruins of their habitations, were thrown to a vast dis tance around. . . . From some of the wretched fugitives I learned that the disaster was . . . connected with the machinations of that malig nant two-legged monster. (5: no?11) In a world not made solely for any one species, the massacre of the ants re quires the reader to question the uses that humans make of each other and of the natural world. Depictions and descriptions of animals in Evenings at Home resist the ten dency to use animals to fix the idea of difference within a system of thought, and instead challenge such systems by exploring ways of thinking about difference that can accommodate multiplicity. Barbauld's "The Wasp and the Bee," for example, articulates the central question of social in equality: why do similar things receive different treatment? The story be gins when a wasp points out to a bee that they "are both very much alike . . . are both winged insects . . . both love honey, and . . . both sting people</page><page sequence="17">(DIS)OBEDIENCE IN EVENINGS AT HOME 657 when we are angry," which provokes the wasp to ask why "men are so ill natured to me, while they are so fond of you?" (i: 20). Given their similar ity, it seems unfair to the wasp that "men always hate me, and try to kill me . . . yet they build you curious houses, thatched with straw, and take care of, and feed you, in the winter" (1: 20-21) The bee responds by blaming the wasp for not being useful to humans: Because you never do them any good, but, on the contrary, are very troublesome and mischievous; therefore they do not like to see you; but they know that I am busy all day long in making them honey. You had better pay them fewer visits, and try to be useful. (1: 21) Taken as a lesson for children rather than for wasps, the bee's advice im plies that the child ought to model his or her own behavior after the bee, rather than the wasp, and make him or herself more useful. Yet there is an unavoidable absurdity in a bee telling a wasp to make itself more useful to humans, as the bee is essentially telling the wasp to become a bee. Since the wasp's inability to do so cannot be seen as a moral failing, the inability of some people to make themselves economically useful, the story implies, also ought not to be seen as a moral failing. That argument, however, poten tially leads to an essentialist concept of class in which given social distinc tions are based on natural distinctions, so that the existing social hierarchy is not challenged but justified. The moral of "The Wasp and the Bee" becomes further complicated when read in dialogue with other stories from the collection. Where "The Wasp and the Bee" does not interrogate the motives behind human friend liness to bees, "The Transmigrations of Indur" makes it clear that humans take care of bees only to steal their honey, since the bees are smoked to death in their hives when they are no longer useful (2: 27). The bee's in junction to the wasp that it should make itself useful to humans can thus be viewed as an argument to subject one's self to exploitation, like that of a privileged slave who complies with the slave-owner's demands and berates the rebellious slave for provoking his or her own punishment. To the ex tent that the wasp is a symbol for human behavior, therefore, the story will support a hierarchical concept of society, but to the extent the wasp is a wasp, it reveals how much a concept of nature that judges everything by its economic utility is merely self-serving. This ambiguity gives Evenings at Home its ability to teach readers to achieve multiple perspectives?to be come, that is, critical readers. The unequal treatment of the poor is even more explicitly criticized in "Mouse, Lapdog, and Monkey, a Fable." The focal point of this story is a "poor little mouse, being half-starved," who is spotted by humans (1: 98). The family responds to the pitifully described mouse with immediate vio</page><page sequence="18">658 DARREN HOWARD lence, as "some called for the cat; others took up whatever was at hand, and endeavoured to crush her to pieces; and the poor terrified animal was driven round the room in an agony of terror" (i: 99). The mouse escapes to her hole, only to see a pet monkey and lapdog enter the room, whose obsequious "fawning and buffoonery" earns them "the best morsels of the entertainment" (1: 99). The story presents the mouse, lapdog, and monkey collectively as metaphors for the poor, for children, and for the entire ani mal kingdom, all of which are depicted as dependent on the benevolence of wealthy humans. The mouse's rueful complaint articulates the broader injustice suffered by the poor and by (unfashionable) animals alike: Alas, how ignorant was I, to imagine that poverty and distress were sufficient recommendations to the charity of the opulent. I now find, that whoever is not master of fawning and buffoonery, is but ill qualified for a dependent, and will not be suffered even to pick up the crumbs that fall from the table. (1: 100) The social critique here verges on a critique of the treatment of children, who are, like the mouse, dependents living in a house owned by others. The parallel between the mouse and the child makes for a strange moral, teaching the child to become a "master of fawning and buffoonery." The generic pressure of children's literature against such "immoral" interpreta tions leads the reader to a critique of adults who ignore "poverty and dis tress" while rewarding "fawning and buffoonery," in animals or in humans. It is difficult, with this critical perspective, not to return to "The Wasp and the Bee" and see the wasp as the persecuted mouse and the bee as the fa vored monkey or lapdog. Aikin's "The Little Dog" continues to interrogate the ideal of servility among animals, children, and the poor, and suggests that visions of hierar chy are perhaps better rendered in terms of a complex interdependence. The story tells of the puppy Fido, whose sole desire is to "show [his] grati tude to our good master, and make myself of some value to him" (1: 119). At first, like Blake's Thel, he laments his uselessness: I cannot draw or carry burdens, like the horse; nor give him milk, like the cow; nor lend him my covering for his clothing, like the sheep; nor produce him eggs, like the poultry; nor catch mice and rats so well as the cat. I cannot divert him with singing, like the canaries and lin nets; nor can I defend him against robbers, like our relation Towzer; I should not be of use to him even if I were dead, as the hogs are. I am a poor, insignificant creature, not worth the cost of keeping; and I don't see that I can do a single thing to entitle me to his regard. (1:119?20) Beyond bringing our attention to the many ways in which humans are in fact dependent on animals, this lament conjures the parallel of the child,</page><page sequence="19">(DIS)OBEDIENCE IN EVENINGS AT HOME 659 who is also less "useful" than these animals. Fido's mother tells him, "Do but love your master dearly, and prove your love by all the means in your power, and you will not fail to please him" (i: 120). Fido takes this advice to heart, and promptly fawns over his master, making an elaborate show of his servility: The little dog was comforted with this assurance, and, on his master's approach, ran to him, licked his feet, gambolled before him, and every now and then stopped, wagging his tail, and looking up to him with expressions of the most humble attachment. (1: 120-21) Fido falls over himself trying to serve his master, entertaining him, driving away sparrows from the chicken feed, scaring away animals that do not be long to his master, keeping all the animals that do belong to him from straying, and eventually has the honor of rescuing his master from a fire. In short, he became "a very trusty protector of his master's property" (1: 122). As a figurative human type, Fido's desperate desire to please can appear cloying and pitiful, but as a dog, his humility sentimentalizes and confirms the view of adult humans as protectors and owners of the animal world, the child, and the lower classes, all of whom are encouraged to seek ways in which to make themselves useful to their superiors. Making this explicit, the story ends with a break in the narration and an external tag: Moral: The poorest man may repay his obligations to the richest and greatest by faithful and affectionate service?the meanest creature may obtain the favour and regard of the Creator himself, by humble grati tude, and steadfast obedience. (1: 123-24) The concluding moral reduces the meaning of the story to a didactic alle gory, advocating obedience on a social and theological level. Fido's eleva tion in the social fabric of the farm forms a model not just for children but for the poor, who are likewise prompted to see their labor as service ren dered to a superior being. But the story conveys something else as well, apart from its theological and social morals. The long list of tasks that Fido cannot do for his master appears to be unnecessarily repetitive unless we see that part of the purpose of the story is to teach the child how much humans are indebted to animals. By the time Fido's master "acknowledged his obli gation to this little animal as the preserver of his life" (1: 123), the meaning of that obligation extends from all humans to all non-humans. The de pendence of the animal, the child, and the poor on others involves an un acknowledged interdependence, so that the concept of a hierarchical sys tem of dependents and protectors proves untenable. The story is able to contain both morals?the explicit one of servility and the implicit one of human obligation to non-humans?only by forcing the reader to identify with both Fido and Fido's master.</page><page sequence="20">660 DARREN HOWARD Throughout Evenings at Home, animals offer an opportunity to critique ideologies of exploitation even within genres predisposed to such ideolo gies. The complicity of natural history with conservative and imperialist ideologies has been well established by critics, including Lucile Brockway, Richard Drayton, R. H. Grove, and J. M. Mackenzie.30 Of the twenty nat ural history pieces in Evenings at Home, those which focus on botany largely support that thesis, as they tend to judge the external world by its utility as an economic resource. Yet those which focus on animals counter the fun damental justifications for exploitation, finding intrinsic value in the natural world by highlighting the interdependence of humans and animals, the subjectivity of animals, and the moral consideration their subjectivity de mands from humans. In the botanical pieces, for example, a child only has to look at an oak tree to be told that oak is used to build wagons, carts, ships, and door frames. In "On the Martin," however, a father tells his son about the martins that build their nests beneath the eaves of their house, emphasizing their social and familial relationships, "their sagacity, and also . . . their disposition to help one another" (i: 130). The piece ends with an injunction to "never knock down their nests, or take their eggs or young ones . . . for as they come such a long way to visit us, and lodge in our houses without fear, we ought to use them kindly" (1: 133-34). It 1S n?t only the evidence of rationality, morality, and community that the father uses to argue for the moral relevance of the martin, but the mere fact of their trusting cohabitation with human society, which martins happen to share with the child readers themselves. The limits of natural history as a way to approach the existence of others, however, is taken up in Barbauld's "A Lesson in the Art of Distin guishing." The piece begins when Charles sees a horse in a meadow and his father asks him first what it is, second, who it belongs to, and third, "How do you know it is a horse, if you never saw it before?" (2: 121). This progression from naming the animal to owning it, and then to "knowing" the horse through purely linguistic means proves central to the scientific conception of the horse. In the Socratic dialogue that ensues, Charles's fa 30. Lucile H.

Along the way, Charles's impatience with linguistic quibbles in favor of the clarity of sensory experience grows more pronounced. Charles argues that their definition of a horse "does not tell us a great deal . . . if I had never seen a horse, I should not know what kind of animal it was by this definition" (2: 132, 134). Charles's reversal here of the question his father asked at the beginning of the dialogue, "How do you know it is a horse, if you never saw it before?" suggests that language fills different functions for adults and children. For Charles, language exists to learn about that which one has not yet experienced, while for Charles's father, language exists to organize experience. Charles's father defends the value of scientific definitions by comparing the process of defining to a hunt: It is a sort of chase, and resembles the manner of hunting in some countries, where they first enclose a large circle with their dogs, nets, and horses, and then, by degrees, draw their toils closer and closer, driving their game before them, till it is at length brought into so nar row a compass, that the sportsmen have nothing to do but to knock down their prey. (2: 132-33) The simile of taxonomic classification as a form of linguistic hunting proves all too literal for Charles, who offers an alternative definition of the horse as "a fine, large, prancing creature, with slender legs and an arched neck, and a sleek, smooth skin, and a tail that sweeps the ground, and that he snorts and neighs very loud, and tosses his head, and runs as swift as the wind" (2: 134). Charles's father defuses the attractiveness of his son's evocation of a horse by aligning it with literature, and distinguishing "Definition" from "Description," but Charles insists, "I like a description best, papa" (2: 136). The story anticipates the reader's probable agreement with Charles by hav ing his father condescendingly agree: I believe I should have done the same at your age. Remember, how ever, that nothing is more useful, than to learn to form ideas with pre cision, and to express them with accuracy; I have not given you a definition to teach you what a horse is, but to teach you to think. (2: 136) Charles's father equates thinking with using a logical language depleted of the subjectivity of sensory experience, establishing the conflict between Charles's sensory apprehension of the world and his father's scientific, ra tionalist perspective as a choice between feeling and thinking, humanism</page><page sequence="22">662 DARREN HOWARD and the sciences, animal and human. But the reader?as a reader?cannot help but be attracted to the literary, and prefer description over definition along with Charles. The piece thus leaves the reader convinced less of the need for analytical thinking than of the inadequacy of that rationality which reductively defines humans against animals and adults against chil dren. The work's depictions of animal societies present alternative forms of so cial organization and thus require the sort of guided reading that Trimmer recommends in order to lead a child away from dangerous interpretations. Aikin's "The Hog and other Animals," for example, inverts Burke's imag ery of the "swinish multitude" with a story about a swinish aristocrat. The story focuses on a pig who brags that the farmer evidently values him over all the other farm animals because he is kept for his own sake, not for his usefulness: [Y]ou are all of you creatures maintained for use?poor subservient things, made to be enslaved or pillaged. I, on the contrary, have a warm style and plenty of provisions all at free cost. I have nothing to do but to grow fat and follow my amusement; and my master is best pleased when he sees me lying at ease in the sun, or gratifying my ap petite for food. (6: 116) The aristocratic hog is here superimposed over the stock character of Aesopian fables, the non-industrious braggart. Read as a traditional fable, the story begins as a warning against the vices of pride and laziness. The pig's isolated luxury, however, makes a stark contrast with the non-swinish multitude of working animals on the farm. The Jacobin tendencies of the story grow more pronounced when winter brings a shortage of food and the farmer must decide which of his animals to slaughter. After comparing the usefulness of each animal, the farmer finally observes, But my hogs will eat me out of house and home, without doing me any good. They must go to pot, that's certain; and the sooner I get rid of the fat ones, the better. So saying, he singled out the orator, as one of the prime among them, and sent him to the butcher the very next day. (6: 117) The implication is clear: when there is a food shortage?as there was in the mid-i790s?the useless aristocracy and the "orators" like Burke who sup port their privileges should be sacrificed for the good of the majority. If this story's politics?or that of the other pieces in Evenings at Home? were as unabashedly radical as this reading suggests, however, Trimmer would never have approved of the work even to the extent that she did,</page><page sequence="23">(DIS)OBEDIENCE IN EVENINGS AT HOME 663 and there would be no debate about the politics of 1790s children's litera ture. Instead, the radical reading remains only a suggestion beneath a much more traditional fable where the animals are mere stand-ins for human types, and the farmer, to whom the animals refer only as their "master," is a stand-in simultaneously for a social superior and for God. One could even argue that the genre of fable is disposed to such a reading, as it produces the moral we have found in other fables?the hidden rewards of being humble and industrious. Read in this light, however, the story exhibits an hostility to children that remains latent in such fables. The child, after all, is more like the pig than the working animals, in that the child is not expected to work (at least as regards the middle-class children who are the intended readers of Eve nings at Home), but still has the equivalent of "a warm style and plenty of provisions all at free cost." In this light, the farmer's decision to send the hog to the butcher to prevent him from "eating me out of house and home, without doing me any good," bears disturbing consequences for the story as a lesson for children, so that the conservative reading becomes as unthinkable as reading Swift's "A Modest Proposal" without irony: The child who does not earn his or her keep, such a reading would conclude, does not deserve to live. The story remains open-ended due to the lingering sense that the pig's punishment?whether he represents an idle child or an idle aristocrat?is unnecessarily harsh. The pig, as the focal point of the story and as a charac ter with whom the reader might recognize a similarity, becomes an object of sympathy and does not, according to the laws of justice implied by the narrative, deserve to die simply for being smug or lazy, nor for misinter preting his role on the farm, of which he could not be aware. The story evokes a moral universe, not the amoral world of an Aesopian fable where the primary means of evaluating characters is by their survival or the satis faction of their desires. By judging animals (and thus, symbolically, people) only in terms of their utility, the farmer?and by implication, all adult humans?plays the role of the pig. The farmer's actions actually validate the pig's earlier evaluation of the other animals, that they are only "main tained for use?poor subservient things, made to be enslaved or pillaged." The pig's inability to see his own inclusion in that verdict parallels the farmer's own inability to see himself in the utilitarian terms by which he rules the farm. The moral and political message of the Jacobin reading (that the non-industrious, aristocratic pig deserves his punishment) collapses into the Burkean conservative reading (that the non-industrious, lower-class pig deserves his punishment), as both base individual value on utility, while the generic expectations of the children's story, as established in the other pieces of Evenings at Home, reserve a space for the inherent value of the in</page><page sequence="24">664 DARREN HOWARD dividual. The gestures toward a traditional fable thus function collectively as a screen to disguise the more radical elements of the story, allowing it to be read unknowingly by those who would not necessarily agree with its politics, and make it exactly the kind of story Trimmer talks about, requir ing a guided reading that leads one to see only the conservative tendencies without seeing the Jacobin subtext. The juxtaposition of Jacobin and anti-Jacobin elements in Evenings at Home leads us back to the debate regarding the political orientation of eigh teenth century children's literature and that debate's first incarnation in the opposing critiques of children's literature by Lamb and Trimmer. The de pictions of animals in Evenings at Home offer a way out of this dilemma once we note that all of the depictions converse thematically on a critique of the anti-Jacobin location of moral value in existing hierarchies, as well as on a critique of the Jacobin concept of utility as a precondition for moral value.31 Both critiques, as we have seen, emerge from the unironized privi leging of animal perspectives. Evenings at Home resists both the older concept of the Chain of Being as a hierarchy of spiritual worth and the newer concept of the Chain of Being as a hierarchy of the food chain, both of which place humans at the top of a hierarchy of morally relevant subjects. Through the juxtaposition of multi ple perspectives, the work suggests the need for an ethics that can account for multiplicity. In "What Animals Are Made For," for example, when the child Sofia complains that flies "do a great deal more harm than good, for I am sure they plague me sadly" (4: 147) her father situates flies within the complex interdependence of the natural world, "[f]lies eat up many things, that would otherwise corrupt and become loathsome; and they serve for food to birds, spider, and many other animals" (4: 147-48), and he asks her to consider the fly's perspective: Suppose a fly capable of thinking; would he not be equally puzzled to find out what men were good for? This great, two-legged monster, he might say, instead of helping us to live, devours more food at a meal than would serve a whole legion of flies. Then he kills us by hundreds, when we come within his reach; and I see him destroy and torment all other animals too. And when he dies, he is nailed up in a box, and put 31. The placement of utility at the center of moral thinking is not confined to Jeremy Bentham's work, but part of a pervasive revolution in moral thinking in the eighteenth cen tury, coming out of the same social developments that produced Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations.

(4: 148) Encouraged to think as a fly, Sophia and the reader are taught a version of the Chain of Being in which the interdependence and inherent value of all beings make them equally valuable in moral terms. Sophia's father chal lenges the use of utility as a moral yardstick by asking to whom things ought to be useful: "you could not find out of what use flies were to us; whereas, when they suck our blood, there is no doubt that we are of use to them," and he goes on to say, "there are vast tracts of the earth where few or no men inhabit, which are yet full of beasts, birds, insects, and all living things. These certainly do not exist for his use alone" (4: 149). When Sophia asks, "[t]hen what are they made for," her father simply responds, "[t]hey are made to be happy" (4: 150). Even when Sophia's father insists that "[w]e have a right to make a reasonable use of all creatures for our ad vantage, and also to free ourselves from such as are hurtful to us" (4: 150), he is not claiming a special privilege for humans over other animals but treating humans as part of what can only be called an ecosystem, which he describes as "a perpetual warfare ... in which the stronger prey upon the weaker, and, in their turns, are the prey of those which are a degree stron ger than ourselves" (4: 152). The chain of pr?dation, however, results in a world that can support the maximum diversity and quantity of life, for, " [b]y making animals the food of animals, Providence has filled up every chink, as it were, of existence" (4: 153). Plenitude, as this concept is re ferred to in earlier conceptions of the Chain of Being, is now a sign not of God's generosity to humans, but that "the Creator equally desires the hap piness of all his creatures, and looks down with as much benignity upon these flies that are sporting around us, as upon ourselves" (4: 150). The concept of the relationship between humans and animals is transformed from a focus on difference and domination to similarity and interdepen dence. The difficulty of ascertaining the political leanings of Evenings at Home springs out of its refusal of single answers?its refusal of both Burkean and Jacobin concepts of difference, both an inherent hierarchy and a hierarchy of utility?and its location of value in plurality and difference. Through the dialectical presentation of animal perspectives and the acts of imaginative sympathy required by the stories involving animals, Evenings at Home as a whole thus encourages, even demands, a form of critical reading in which multiple perspectives and meanings can coexist. The use of animal subject ivities to create this critical space supplies a basis from which the child reader may judge the society he or she is being trained to enter. The child,</page><page sequence="26">666 DARREN HOWARD necessarily estranged from a society into which he or she has not yet been fully interpolated, looks at society through the eyes of an animal, and sees the ways in which humans unknowingly conspire in their own oppression, as well as in the destruction of the natural world. By problematizing the role of the animal in human culture the stories in Evenings at Home prob lematize the role of the child; by giving voice to animal critiques of human culture, they train children to be critics. The animality of the child is no longer treated as a threat, but as a potentially redemptive quality, an oppor tunity for a renewed connection to and understanding of the natural world and the place of humans in it.
