<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sidney P. Albert1 THE LORD'S PRAYER AND MAJOR BARBARA You pray with sincerity "Our blunderer which art not in heaven, blessed be thy excellent intentions, hurry up with thy kingdom which is so long coming, get thy job done on earth which will then be heaven. Give us this day our daily vitality; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive yours, knowing that you mean well. Lead us into all sorts of temptations, and never say die; for thine is the impulse and the gumption and the glory, world without end, Amen."2 Much of Bernard Shaw's theology is epitomized in this irreverent par- ody of the Lord's Prayer. Indeed, it is advanced during, and as part of, an earnest explication of his religious views to his learned friend, Gil- bert Murray. That Shaw would turn to this prayer as a vehicle for expounding his own distinctive doctrines is not in the least surprising in view of his penchant for appropriating to his own uses traditional religious phraseology, and infusing it with heterodox Shavian meaning. Besides, this was a prayer that held a lifelong fascination for him. In the autobiographical Preface to Immaturity, Shaw relates that in childhood he had directed his literary talent to the creation of his own prayers: I cannot recall the words of the final form I adopted; but I remember that it was in three movements, like a sonata, and in the best Church of Ireland style. It ended with the Lord's Prayer; and I repeated it every night in bed. The prayer, he makes clear, was no petition: I had too much sense to risk my faith by begging for things I knew very well I should not get; so I did not care whether my prayers were answered or not: they were a literary performance for the entertainment and propitiation of the Almighty . . . The Lord's Prayer I used once or twice as a protective spell. Thunder- storms are much less common in Ireland than in England; and the first two I remember frightened me horribly. During the second I bethought me of the Lord's Prayer, and steadied myself by repeating it.3</page><page sequence="2">108 SIDNEY P. ALBERT Obviously he bethought himself of this prayer many times in his adult life as well, for it is oft mentioned or alluded to in both his dramatic and nondramatic writings. Though in his days as a dramatic critic he took exception to the assumption "that what makes a play religious is the introduction of the Lord's Prayer,"4 as a playwright he unhesitatingly availed himself of its language. Especially is this true of its doxology: "For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever, Amen." The Apple Cart employs it twice. In the first act Boa- nerges boasts to King Magnus of his secure position as a trade union official, acquired by demogogic assurances to his worker constituents that, having the vote, "theirs is the kingdom and the power and the glory." And in the play's waning moments Magnus himself remarks ruefully to Lysistrata: "The kingdom and the power and the glory will pass from us and leave us naked, face to face with our real selves at last."5 Again, it is an "echo from the Lord's Prayer" that Shaw gives to the "rascal" at the end of Too True to be Good: " - or whether in some pentecostal flame of revelation the Spirit will descend on me and in- spire me with a message the sound whereof shall go out unto all lands and realize for us at last the Kingdom and the Power and the Glory for ever and ever. Amen."b In Back to Methuselah Franklyn Barnabus, in slightly variant phrasing, asks: " 'The power and the glory, world with- out end': have those words meant nothing to you?"7 The opening words of the Lord's Prayer - "Our Father which art in heaven" - also recur in Shaw's works, especially in the discussions of religion, where its theological adequacy is frequently challenged. A 1912 lecture takes aim at its male bias: "Nowadays we see that it is ridiculous to keep saying 'Our Father which art in heaven.' What about our Mother who art in heaven? . . . Clearly, if you have a personal God, one of the first difficulties is to determine the sex of that God."8 The Black Girl, in Shaw's story, after raising the same point with the Conjurer, adds another. Having suffered paternal beatings throughout her childhood, she adamantly refuses "to say 'Our father which art in heaven.' I always say 'Our grandfather.' "9 On an entirely different tack, in the Preface to Misalliance Shaw argues the superfluity of mortal godparents by taking punning advantage of the circumstance that in England "the first article of belief is that every child is born with a godfather whom we call 'our father which art in heaven.' "10 A more favorable estimate of the same "father in heaven" concept is to be found in such late works as Everybody's Political What's What? and Sixteen Self Sketches. Credited as a contribution of Jesus, it is com- mended as representing a far more civilized view of God than the antecedent belief in Jehovah. This appraisal reflects the Shavian teach-</page><page sequence="3">the lord's prayer and Major Barbara 109 ing that the Bible, properly interpreted, records the evolution of the idea of God, "the first effort of civilized mankind to account for the existence and origin and purpose of as much of the universe as we are conscious of" - a progression in which an idealized "affectionate father" emerges as one of the more advanced stages.11 Still, it receives only a relative and qualified approval: the notion of a heavenly father itself needs to be superseded. Even the popular name "God" Shaw considers too limiting and anthropomorphic for the "great force in the universe," which for him "is something larger than a per- sonal force." Nevertheless he does not wholly abandon the term. Rather, as he puts it, the "evolutionary process to me is God: this wonderful will of the universe, struggling and struggling," and devel- oping ever higher forms of life, including human beings as its essential agents.12 In each of the instances thus far cited, the references to the Lord's Prayer are unmistakable. Less obvious, but of greater dramatic mo- ment, is the allusive implication of the Prayer in one of Shaw's most complex plays, Major Barbara. The passage in the play most patently indebted to it turns up almost at the very end - more precisely, in the penultimate scene. There the dialogue between Barbara and Gusins builds to her exultant declaration of a new-found faith: I have got rid of the bribe of bread. I have got rid of the bribe of heaven. Let God's work be done for its own sake: the work he had to create us to do because it cannot be done except by living men and women. When I die, let him be in my debt, not I in his; and let me forgive him as becomes a woman of my rank.13 Shaw's instructive stage directions describe his heroine as "transfig- ured" when delivering this triumphant speech. In directing Annie Rus- sell, the original Barbara, he called her attention to the "curious touch of aristocratic pride" evinced in these lines. Years later he advised a Danish actress not to hesitate carrying the end of the play "to the wildest limits of your inspiration."14 Certainly in style and fervor this transfiguration speech is suggestive of a prayer, though its content hardly seems designed to propitiate the divine. Absent is any supplication, petition, adoration, praise, or even thanksgiving. In their stead is a bold, apostate self-assurance, champi- oning a heterodox meliorism. The stance is one of Promethean chal- lenge, not unlike that espoused elsewhere by Shaw, and closely identi- fied with his Superman. lo Yet this utterance has no difficulty in qualifying as prayer under Shaw's own later blanket prescription: "Prayer consoles, heals, builds the soul in us; ... there are all sorts of prayers, from mere beggars'</page><page sequence="4">110 SIDNEY P. ALBERT petitions and magic incantations to contemplative soul building, and all sorts of divinities to pray to."16 The rebuilding of souls - her own and others - is precisely what Barbara is contemplating. Though not praying to any divinity, she is unquestionably embracing the Shavian theology, which translates "God" into the Life Force, Berg- son's élan vital, or the "evolutionary appetite," defined as an unaccount- able natural agency in the universe: "a mysterious drive towards greater power over our circumstances and deeper understanding of Nature, in pursuit of which men and women will risk death as explor- ers or martyrs, and sacrifice their personal comfort and safety against all prudence, all probability, all common sense."17 As already indicated, Shaw frequently nourishes the mysticism of his Creative Evolutionism by couching its basically naturalistic teachings in seemingly incompat- ible supernaturalistic religious language.18 Closer inspection of Barbara's speech discloses verbal clues that link it to the Lord's Prayer: specifically, the words "bread," "heaven," "debt" (in one version of the Prayer), "forgive," and "God's work be done" (as a variant of "Thy will be done"). The intimation is strong then that she is offering a special Shavian reading of this principal Christian prayer.19 Jesus, it is pertinent to recall, taught the Lord's Prayer to his disciples as part of the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 6:9-13; a shorter version is in Luke 1 1:2-4). In like manner Barbara delivers her sermon-prayer on the crest of a Middlesex hill. The scriptural context persists into her next speech as well, as she draws upon the 23rd Psalm to envision "the unveil- ing of an eternal light in the Valley of The Shadow."20 In the valley below, she is reminding us, lies the Undershaft "factory of death," as Cusins has dubbed it. Thus in Major Barbara, as later in The Apple Cart and Too True to be Good, we hear a Shavian "echo" of the Lord's Prayer at the end of the play. In this instance, however, indications are compelling that the Prayer has been resonating all along, so that it would be a serious oversight to hearken solely to its climactic tones. Accordingly it will be necessary to inquire into what other reflections of the Prayer are discernible in the drama, and how they bear upon Barbara's later formulation. As we shall see, there is ample evidence that the Lord's Prayer - whether by intent or inadvertence - functions as a kind of ironic leitmotif to the development of a variety of Shavian themes in the play. The Prayer itself, also known as Pater Noster, consists of the intro- ductory address ("Our Father which art in heaven"), six petitions, and the appended doxology. Let us consider the applicability of each of these components to Major Barbara.</page><page sequence="5">the lord's prayer and Major Barbara 111 Our Father Which Art In Heaven The father theme pervades Major Barbara. (The word "father" in one way or another, appears thirty times in Act I, and over half as often in each of the other two acts.) The first act is organized around the home- coming of the long absent father of the Undershaft family, Andrew Undershaft. The extended expository conversation between his wife, Lady Britomart, and their son, Stephen, insistently focuses anticipatory interest on this paterfamilias, who is constantly referred to and ad- dressed as "father" throughout the play. In rapid order we learn of his enormous wealth, formidable worldly power, and essential immunity from accepted political and legal constraints. A munitions potentate whose ruling authority in his nearly three-centuries-old firm was conferred upon him in the manner of an Antonine emperor, he as- sumes superhuman dimensions virtually from the outset. When he does appear on the scene and is introduced to the family, the comic identity confusions that ensue, and his candid acknowledgment of the awkwardness of his position as stranger-father, testify at once to his paternal atypicality. A deft and dramatic transition from the human to the divine plane is effected when Lady Britomart ascribes daughter Barbara's unconven- tional Salvation Army behavior to having come of age with "no father to advise her": BARBARA. Oh yes she has. There are no orphans in the Salvation Army. UNDERSHAFT. Your father there has a great many children and plenty of experience, eh? BARBARA [looking at him with quick interest and nodding] Just so. How did you come to understand that? [pp. 87-88]21 Immediately thereafter comes his claim of even closer affinity to the Army: UNDERSHAFT. ... I am rather interested in the Salvation Army. Its motto might be my own: Blood and Fire. LOMAX [shocked] But not your sort of blood and fire, you know. UNDERSHAFT. My sort of blood cleanses: my sort of fire purifies. Conveyed is something more than the lethal efficacy of his weaponry: an enigmatic intimation of purgative powers drawn from control of the most vital and deadly forces of nature. (In the next act he directly equates his money and gunpowder with command of life and death [p. 120].) Fittingly, the ensuing exchange raises the question of Undershaft's</page><page sequence="6">112 SIDNEY P. ALBERT relation to heaven. His admission that he is a passable trombone player prompts Barbara to observe that the Army had helped many sinners play their way into heaven on that instrument. But Lomax persists in thinking cannon-making an insurmountable barrier. "Getting into heaven is not exactly in your line, is it?" he brashly asks Undershaft (p. 89). The latter's undismayed rejection of Christian morality in favor of a religious ethics that makes due provision for cannons and torpedoes only serves as a further goad to Barbara's salvationism. "There are neither good men nor scoundrels," she insists; "there are just children of one Father" (p. 90), voicing the "Christian formula" that Shaw takes to be an affirmation of "the scientific fact of human equality" (Preface, p. 48). From her Christian perspective these mortal offspring are all to be accounted sinners, sharing precisely the same opportunity for salvation. (A harsher side of this filial relationship to the divine comes into play in the second act when she invokes fear of Jenny Hill's "father in heaven" in reproving Bill Walker for striking that young Salvationist [p. 106].) Reciprocal proselytizing challenges by father and daughter set the stage for the comic gibes at conventional religious services and prayer that bring the first act to a close. Singled out for the most pointed barbs - leveled by Cusins - is the General Confession in the Book of Common Prayer (pp. 92-93). Beneath its surface gaiety, Act I of Major Barbara tellingly satirizes upper class British religion and morality. The play's approach to "Our Father which art in heaven" is therefore inevitably ironic. Comprehen- sion of a heavenly father comes by way of a redoubtable earthly coun- terpart. A figure outwardly easygoing, patient in manner, and engag- ingly simple in character, according to Shaw's description, Undershaft is endowed with a "capacious chest and long head" in which are stored "formidable reserves of power, both bodily and mentar (p. 84). So depicted he is the very incarnation of contained explosive force - a living symbol of the bombs he manufactures. Lacking specifiable ancestry, unfettered by family ties, defiant toward social conventions, unconstrained by na- tional boundaries, he is a being godlike in his resistance to finite con- tainment. Among his other attributes is the capability of producing latter-day equivalents of thunder, lightning, and earthquake devasta- tion - powers once held to be the peculiar province of deities. Additional facets of the incalculable paternalism of Undershaft come to the fore as the play progresses. In Act II the dialogue once more neatly juxtaposes him and the divine Father. Upon learning that Peter Shirley is a Secularist, Barbara, after breezily surmising that her own father is a fellow unbeliever, swiftly puts the fitter in his cosmic place with a thought borrowed from Tennyson: "Our Father - yours and mine - fulfils himself in many ways" (p. 105).22 The irony escapes</page><page sequence="7">the lord's prayer and Major Barbara 1 13 Barbara, but it is certainly true that her own father has many ways of fulfilling himself. Revelation of some of the ways awaits her and the others. In the following act his wealth is shown to bring under his sway not only the workers in his factory, but also the community in which they reside. From that base he is able to manipulate public opinion and mold gov- ernmental policy. More immediately, he offers an object lesson in how to buy off a religious organization, however militant its opposition to his own objectives. When Mrs. Baines delightedly responds to his five thousand pound benefaction with a grateful "Thank God!" he una- bashedly asks, "You don't thank me?" (p. 131). During this same act Cusins hails him as "Father Colossus," "Mammoth Millionaire," and eventually "Dionysos Undershaft" - each an appellation of awe; the first proclaiming his patriarchal prodigiousness, the second the immen- sity of his fortune, and the third identifying him with a life-force god. Evidence of an unfolding Undershaftian epiphany abounds in the play. Still, if we take our cue from the parody prayer that serves as epi- graph for this essay, we should have no trouble understanding that the divinity that hedges the cannon king need not inspire reverence. In- deed, his portrait as a potent world spirit is ambiguous and double- edged. A diabolical aura clings to his disreputable occupation, his traf- ficking in war and carnage. It also hovers about his canny stalking of the souls of Barbara and Cusins. The latter, privy to the intent of their adversary, calls him "an infernal old rascal," "Mephistopheles," "The Prince of Darkness," "clever, clever, devil," and "you old demon." Counterpoised is his benign aspect: as mystical prophet, model em- ployer, implacable foe of poverty, and social catalyst. Benefactor and death merchant, he provides his employees with economic security in a thriving town where the prospect of being blown to kingdom come is a constant condition of life. Father Undershaft may dwell in heaven, but his celestial city sits on the brink of hell. Pertinent to this sobering thought may be several tenets of Shavian religious doctrine articulated in his commentary on the teachings of Jesus. In the Preface to Androcles and the Lion Shaw cites with approval such sayings by Jesus as "I and my father are one," and "God is a spirit," recorded in the fourth gospel (John 10:30; 4:24). The former he generalizes into "you and your father are one." Subsequently he credits Jesus with "the most penetrating good sense" in declaring "that the reality behind the popular belief in God was a creative spirit in ourselves called by him the Heavenly Father and by us Evolution, Élan Vital, Life Force and other names."23 To which must be added the concurrence of Jesus in the 82nd Psalm's affirmation that "ye are gods" (John 10:34).</page><page sequence="8">114 SIDNEY P. ALBERT Putting these ideas together, it would appear that Undershaft as Barbara's "father in heaven" is godly as a dynamic embodiment of the Life Force; we and he being one would make him an Everyman-god, or theomorphic Everyfather, in whom it is possible to discern larger-than- life reflections of ourselves.24 In the heaven-hell linkage may well be mirrored the insight that our hopes are inseparable from our fears, and that realization of our highest aspirations is contingent upon the conquest of our deadliest perils. These conclusions, it may be noted, are compatible with the message in the Lord's Prayer parody that the Life Force is, after all, not in heaven - heaven being, in fact, an earthly goal towards which this blind force needs to be directed.23 Hallowed Be Thy Name The name of Undershaft is hallowed, that is, sanctified, holy.2b The arms maker (and his predecessors) acquired the Undershaft cognomen from the parish and Church of St. Andrew Undershaft, so named because it once stood under the shaft of a maypole. Hence it is that Shaw devotes one section of the Major Barbara Preface to "The Gospel of St. Andrew Undershaft." The derivation of his name might incline us to doubt the seriousness of the canonization, were it not for the fact that late in life Shaw still spoke of Undershaft as "the millionaire saint" who "thunders his doctrine that poverty is ... a social crime." Like a deity, as already seen, Undershaft also answers to a variety of names, at least one of which - "Dionysos" - can also lay claim to being "hallowed."27 Nor should we forget that eventually Cusins, in becoming the next Andrew Undershaft, will inherit as well the title of "saint" attached to the name. And if we take into account Shaw's receptiveness to a mother in heaven, Barbara's saintly qualities pertain here too, particularly since she bears the name of the legendary patron saint of armorers: Saint Barbara. Thy Kingdom Come Undershaft is the possessor not only of great powers, but of a princi- pality as well. The worldly might of the firm of Undershaft and Laza- rus emanates from the model factory town of Perivale St. Andrews. At the head of this microcosm he rules like a monarch. Adumbrations of his kingdom come early in the play, with disclosure of its concrete features withheld until well into the final act. Initially it is kept omi- nously unlocalized, attention focused more on the unimpeded, ram- pant spread of its operations. This impression is capsulized in the un-</page><page sequence="9">the lord's prayer and Major Barbara 1 15 welcome inscription inserted in Stephen's Bible, designating Under- shaft and Lazarus as "Death and Destruction Dealers: address, Chris- tendom and Judea" (p. 72). No less forbidding and foreboding is the address of the cannon works given by Undershaft himself later on in the first act: "In Perivale St. Andrews. At the sign of the sword. Ask anybody in Europe" (p. 91). Not to be overlooked is the way that both of these declarations situate the business within a religious setting. The first shows it quite at home in the Judaic-Christian world, and records that fact in a copy of the distinctive scripture of that world. The other is an Undershaftian rejoinder to Barbara that relegates Christian salva- tionism to a far narrower region and sphere of influence than com- merce in weapons. Her Christian insignia, the cross, may be better known in Canning Town; his, the sword, commands awesome respect throughout Europe. Undershaft manifests himself as ruler in his bold "/ am the govern- ment" speech to Stephen (p. 151) in the first scene of the third act. But his own special kingdom comes to the fore in the following scene. His gospel of money and gunpowder there acquires a local habitation and a name: Perivale St. Andrews. "An acre in Middlesex is better than a principality in Utopia," avers Macaulay.28 Better still, Shaw would seem to be saying, is a combination of the two, as he plants Undershaft's Utopian principality on Middlesex acreage. Cusins, anticipating with Barbara a hellish city, grudgingly acknowledges it to be a heavenly one - accepting a Labor Church as the desiderated cathedral that completes the picture. Heaven also figures in the recorded dictum of a predecessor Undershaft: "to Man the weapon: to Heaven the victory" (p. 168). "Heavens! What a place!" marvels Sarah, upon encountering Perivale St. Andrews (p. 158). But the "place," as it is repeatedly and indetermi- nately referred to, is a highly problematical heavenly kingdom, being firmly founded on a factory of death. Nor does the Undershaftian political philosophy, which makes the bullet and courage to kill the essential criteria of government, seem particularly well suited to a heav- enly realm. But if it does not entirely qualify as heavenly, it certainly does as an efficacious kingdom - a place producing the power that can effect change. Undershaft bids Cusins to turn his oughts into shalls, and to make war on war. It is the access to reality and power the establish- ment provides that finally induces the Professor of Greek to consent to become a maker of gunpowder. Barbara, acknowledging the reality of the place, perceives it to be "where salvation is really wanted," a hell that with appropriate courage can be raised to heaven, as man can be raised to God (p. 184). When all is said and done, the overdue, truly promising kingdom come will be that governed by King Adolphus and Queen Barbara.</page><page sequence="10">116 SIDNEY P. ALBERT Thy Will Be Done Construed in Shavian terms, this undercurrent theme courses through the entire play. Undershaft, Shaw explains in the Preface, is a mystic with a "constant sense that he is only the instrument of a Will or Life Force which uses him for purposes wider than his own" (p. 3 1).29 The in- dustrialist himself, owning to being "a confirmed Mystic" (p. 110), al- ludes to this evolutionary force in Act III, when he admits "enigmati- cally" that what drives his business is a "will of which I am a part" (p. 169). The same will or Life Force has additional manifestations. It un- derlies Undershaft's "gospel" of money and gunpowder, which he in- tends to have Barbara preach and convert others to, and which (as ad- verted to earlier) he explicates to mean "Freedom and power. Command of life and command of death" (p. 120). Its morality - or more accu- rately, amorality - he expounds in "the true faith of an Armorer" (p. 168). As a "vital impulse towards perfection," a "divine spark," or "evolu- tionary appetite"30 - other Shavian characterizations of the Life Force - it fuels his war on the crime of poverty. Looking backward, it is the driv- ing force impelling his actions from the beginning. Likewise it is what kindles Cusins' claim to have "more power" and "more will" than the arms magnate, during their debate over "the moral question" (p. 169). No less is it at work motivating his mating with Barbara. And it animates the religious consciousness that imbues Barbara at the drama's end. For, as Shaw was to observe later, the way the universal will or Life Force manifests itself is in the acts, and conflicts, of individual wills. "The strongest, fiercest force in nature," he declares, "is human will. It is the highest organization we know of the will that has created the whole universe."31 That world will Shaw accommodates religiously as "God's will." Complicating adoption of this expression is his espousal of two apparently distinct conceptions of God; but these his doctrine does ultimately conjoin. First of all, God is the creative will or power that has brought us into existence and needs to use our capabilities in its titanic struggle with physical nature. Civilization, so understood, is the mold- ing of nature "to our own purposes and will, and in doing that really molding it to the will of God." God has had us evolve hands and brains "to act and think for Him: in short, we are not in the hands of God; but God is in our hands. A ruler must not say helplessly Thy Will be done': he must divine it, find out how to do it, and have it done."32 (The focus of the criticism, we may note, is once again on the specific language of the Lord's Prayer.) Yet in another sense God for Shaw is "only an ideal towards which creative evolution is striving," and mankind, however imperfect, "merely its best attempt so far." All of us are "experiments in the direction of</page><page sequence="11">the lord's prayer and Major Barbara 1 17 making God. What God is doing is making himself, getting from being a mere powerless will or force." Shaw's God, it follows, is both the evolu- tionary process and the goal it seeks.33 Hence his concept of divinity is itself evolutionary: God is the force striving to realize as its purpose the perfecting of its own being. God is imminent, not transcendent.34 God's will aims at God's work, which can only be done by human beings. God's work, then, is the proper vocation of mankind: If you don't do his work it won't be done; if you turn away from it, if you sit down and say, "Thy will be done," you might as well be the most irreligious person on the face of the earth. But if you will stand by your God, if you will say, "My business is to do your will, my hands are your hands, my tongue is your tongue, my brain is your brain, I am here to do thy work, and I will do it," you will get rid of otherworldliness, you will get rid of all that religion which is made an excuse and a cloak for doing nothing, and you will learn not only to worship your God, but also to have a fellow feeling with him.3a This passage furnishes illuminating commentary on Barbara's re- sponse to the Lord's Prayer. She would have God's work done "for its own sake" - work that can only be done by living individuals. Without saying so, she is abandoning the passive acquiescence in things as they are, implicit in the affirmation, "Thy will be done." Instead she is committing herself to action, to undertaking the truly human career of striving for divinity - a pursuit which puts her on a plane with the limited God or will of the Life Force. Apposite to Barbara too are some remarks Shaw appended to the above passage. What he wants from religion, he tells us, is neither comfort nor happiness, but "a certain self-respect and force in the world," as well as courage. And that is what the conception of doing God's work inspires. It arouses the kind of faith that "really overcomes the power of death" - exactly the kind of faith to which Barbara is testifying.36 In Earth As It Is In Heaven At the heart of Shaw's eschatology is the critical question of the relation of earth to heaven - and hell - in the special meaning these concepts acquire in his thought. The issues it raises receive a thorough dramatic airing in the philosophical dream sequence of Man and Superman. In a program note for the first staging ofthat "Donjuan in Hell" scene, the playwright explained that its underlying theology conceives of heaven, hell, and earth not as places, but as figurative representations of "states of soul." The soul, "the divine element common to all life," makes us</page><page sequence="12">118 SIDNEY P. ALBERT " 'do the will of God' " and value only our "divine activities," never our selfish ones. So regarded, any society may turn into a hell when the desire for selfish pleasure becomes its dominant motive; or into a heaven when its members constitute "a communion of saints" moved by "the passion of the divine will" to the avid pursuit of "divine contem- plation and creative activity" (as is Donjuán).37 In the final pages oí John Bull's Other Island, written between Man and Superman and Major Barbara, Father Keegan more simply identifies heaven and hell with "two conditions of men: salvation and damna- tion." And his parting words depict heaven as a triunity, particularly of State, Church, and people, culminating in "a godhead in which all life is human, and all humanity divine."38 The conceptions of heaven and hell in these works are undoubtedly germane to the vision of heaven (and of hell) that emerges during the last act of Major Barbara. In the play as a whole there is dramatic movement from the more conventional Christian connotations of these terms - especially as they function in the Salvation Army vocabulary - towards the more distinctively Shavian senses. This development paral- lels and mirrors the process of conversion Barbara undergoes. The aspiration in the Lord's Prayer is for earth to emulate heaven. If we focus attention on the earth-heaven axis in Major Barbara we find Barbara proffering in the Salvation Army what her father later derides as "dreams of heaven" (p. 171). As we have seen, in the first act she envisions Undershaft's eventual entry into heaven as a trombone- playing sinner. In the next act she invites Bill to join in the pursuit of "brave manhood on earth and eternal glory in heaven" (p. 113). But her dissillusionment at the shortcomings of the Army's salvationism leads her at last to repudiate its portrait of heaven as representing only an unworthy bribe. Although in a weak moment she yearns like the Psalmist (Psalms 55:6) for "the wings of a dove" on which to "fly away to heaven" (p. 182), and be free of both her father and her husband-to- be, this escapist wish is a fleeting one. In the end, the new "way of life" she embraces is not Cusins' Euripidean idea of finding one's heaven by knowing that "to live is happy" (p. 1 17), but rather the Shavian one of working to raise both hell (and presumably earth) to heaven and man to god. The truly religious task, as the Lord's Prayer parody suggests, is to transform earth itself into heaven. Give Us This Day Our Daily Bread Hunger for "daily bread" is what draws Snobby Price and Rummy Mitchens to the Salvation shelter. They are finishing a meager meal of</page><page sequence="13">the lord's prayer and Major Barbara 119 bread, margarine, syrup, and diluted milk as Act II begins. Before long they are joined by the unemployed and starving fitter, Peter Shirley, who is brought the same meal by Jenny Hill. His qualms about accept- ing such charity she allays by assuring him that the food is a gift from the Lord, who "wasnt above taking bread from his friends" (p. 99). Bread figures twice in Peter's bitter scolding of Bill Walker, after the latter's violent entrance upon the scene. Peter wants to know why "young whelps" like Bill are not content "with takin the bread out o the mouths of your elders that have brought you up and slaved for you, but you must come shovin and cheekin and bullyin in here, where the bread of charity is sickenin in our stummicks?" (p. 102). As their heated exchange continues, Peter disdainfully claims that he himself would have been able to stand up against Bill had he been eating for a week instead of starving for two months. Bill's retort is to charge him with lying, since "youve the bread and treacle in you that you cam eah to beg" (p. 104). In his ensuing confrontation with Barbara, Bill, proudly dissociating himself from the "demmiged lot" who have come to the shelter to beg, spurns her "bread and scripe [scrape] and ketlep [catlap]" (p. 106), along with her God. A bit later, when Barbara bids Rummy toss the crumbs about for the birds, the older woman protests: "This aint a time to waste good bread on birds" (p. 110). The gift of daily bread in the second act becomes a cardinal issue in the third. Undershaft dismisses as "cheap work" the Salvation Army practice of "converting starving men with a Bible in one hand and a slice of bread in the other" (p. 173). Using such tactics he would be prepared to convert West Ham to "Mahometanism." For her part Barbara, in her final assessment of the pervasive power of Undershaft and Bodger, has come to the realization that "when we feed a starving fellow creature, it is with their bread, because there is no other bread" (p. 182). And the clinching lure of Perivale St. An- drews - what persuades her in the end to cast her lot with that commu- nity - is the opportunity it affords her to resume soul-saving, her "re- turn to the colors" as Shaw calls it in the Preface (p. 37). Only no longer will her flock be "weak souls in starved bodies, sobbing with gratitude for a scrap of bread and treacle, but fullfed, quarrelsome, snobbish, uppish creatures" (p. 183). Nor will her father again be able to level the accusation that her converts "were bribed with bread" (p. 184). This is the prelude to her revised Lord's Prayer: "I have got rid of the bribe of bread. I have got rid of the bribe of heaven." On this day the giving of daily bread - at least in the form of charity - has been transcended as a pathway to human salvation. No wonder "vitality" supplants "bread" in Shaw's parody.</page><page sequence="14">120 SIDNEY P. ALBERT And Forgive Us Our Debts, As We Forgive Our Debtors (And Forgive Us Our Trespasses, As We Forgive Them That Trespass Against Us) The first version above is that in Matthew 6:12, the parenthetical alter- native is that in the Book of Common Prayer. Luke 11:4 reads: "And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us." (In 1977 the Church of England approved a modernization of the Lord's Prayer as part of its Alternative Services Series. In this version the line has been altered to "Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us.")39 The original meaning of the Greek word translated "to sin" (hamartia) was "to go astray" or "to miss the mark," which is a rough equivalent of "to trespass." Literally, a "trespass" is a "passing across," and as such a "transgression."40 "Debt," as used in the New Testament passages, is an offense, calling for expiation, reparation, or forgiveness. Hence it too denotes a trespass or sin. The thought expressed in this petition, then - whatever the phraseology - is forgiveness of sin, wrongdoing, or trans- gression. Though Shaw employs the "trespass" wording in his parody, it is the language of debt and repayment that permeates Major Barbara*1 And as already remarked, it is the term "debt" that Barbara uses in her prayer. Forgiveness of transgression is an insistent, recurrent theme throughout Bill Walker's discomfiting encounter with the Salvation Army and Barbara in Act II. When he hits Rummy Mitchens in the face, Jenny cries out, "Oh, God forgive you!" to which he reacts an- grily: "You Gawd forgimme again and Aw'll Gawd forgive you one on the jawr thetll stop you prying for a week" (p. 101). It is the outpouring of forgiveness that distresses Bill, by his own admission: "Aw downt want to be forgive be you, or be ennybody," he tells Jenny upon return- ing from his humiliation at the hands of Todger Fairmile (pp. 126-27). Being forgiven reduces him to the "position of unbearable moral infe- riority" that Shaw describes in the Preface (p. 44). The sovereign he offers Jenny as compensation for striking her is intended to balance accounts so that he will face "no more o your forgivin an prying." But he will not hear of diverting a shilling or two to his other victim, Rummy. Still hostile, unforgiving, and ready to retaliate, she has no access to his conscience. "It's this Christian gime o yours that Aw wownt ev plyed agen me," Bill grumbles; "this bloomin forgivin an neggin an jawrin that mikes a menn thet sore that iz lawf's a burdn to im" (p. 127). But soon that burden is lifted from him by the subtle machina- tions of Undershaft. The four principal characters in the drama all have to come to terms</page><page sequence="15">the lord's prayer and Major Barbara 121 with wrongdoing and its forgiveness. In the first act we learn that Lady Britomart long ago refused to forgive her husband "for preaching immorality while he practised morality" (p. 76). Though she relents in the long run, in the last act she accuses him of being "wickeder than ever," voicing regret for having allowed him to come home again (p. 175). It is his second act conduct, however, that prompts Barbara, in the Wilton Crescent scene of Act III, to tackle the forgiveness of misdeeds as a wider and more serious religious issue. Scoring her father for having undermined her redemptive efforts, she recounts that she had been guiding Bill's soul towards salvation, only to have it revert to drunkenness and derision when the Salvationists accepted Undershaft's money. "I will never forgive you that," she vows. "If I had a child, and you destroyed its body with your explosives - if you murdered Dolly with your horrible guns - I could forgive you if my forgiveness would open the gates of heaven to you" (p. 156). But his actions, in effect causing a human soul to turn lupine, she condemns as worse than murder. Undershaft parries her attack with the disarming suggestion that her ministrations could not have left Bill untouched. Undershaft himself takes up the question of the value of forgiveness in jousting with Cusins, while pressing him to decide whether he will accept the invitation to become heir-designate to the gunpowder king- dom. Adolphus' hesitation because of "things in me that I must reckon with" the reigning armorer meets head on (p. 177). After disposing of two of these scruples in quick order, he proposes a third: UNDERSHAFT. . . . Come! try your last weapon. Pity and love have broken in your hand: forgiveness is still left. CUSINS. No: Forgiveness is a beggar's refuge. I am with you there: we must pay our debts, [p. 178] The latter comment may be read as a pointed answer to the entreaty for forgiveness of debts in the Lord's Prayer. The Preface contains explicit Shavian commentary on this assessment of forgiveness of wrongdoing. Insisting on "the inexorability of the deed once done," Shaw takes sharp issue with the Salvation Army and other "propangandists of the Cross": Forgiveness, absolution, atonement, are figments: punishment is only a pretence of cancelling one crime by another; and you can no more have forgiveness without vindictiveness than you can have a cure with- out a disease. You will never get a high morality from people who conceive that their misdeeds are revocable and pardonable, or in a society where absolution and expiation are officially provided for us all. [p. 43]</page><page sequence="16">122 SIDNEY P. ALBERT Punishment of the unsuccessful scoundrel only inures him to evildoing. In marked contrast, the successful scoundrel reaps Christian rewards: "He is not only forgiven: he is idolized, respected, made much of, all but worshipped" (pp. 45-46). This brings about changes in his con- duct, but not in his character as scoundrel. Shaw is unsparing in his criticism of each of these ways that society deals with its miscreants. In order to achieve the reformed moral order he envisions, it will be necessary to eliminate both punishment and forgiveness: "If there is to be no punishment there can be no forgiveness. We shall never have real moral responsibility until everyone knows that his deeds are irrevo- cable, and that his life depends on his usefulness" (p. 61). The last words about forgiveness and debt in the play are Barbara's in the previously quoted lines of her "prayer": "When I die, let him [God] be in my debt, not I in his; and let me forgive him as becomes a woman of my rank." The point to be made here is that what she says goes beyond the belief shared by Undershaft and Cusins that forgive- ness is to be eschewed in favor of repayment of debt. Their view re- nounces human petitioning for forgiveness as a beggarly way of evad- ing incurred obligations. Her approach to forgiveness raises humanity to the level of divinity. In relation to God - or the Life Force - she no longer seeks forgiveness: she would be the forgiver, not the forgiven - the creditor, not the debtor. As the parody puts it, she is willing to forgive the Life Force its trespasses, magnanimously crediting - even blessing - the "excellent intentions" these reflect. She is moving to a higher standard of morality, and with it to a more exalted evolutionary status.42 And Lead Us Not Into Temptation, But Deliver Us From Evil The Mephistophelean Undershaft is the prime tempter in the drama, and the Faustian Cusins the character most keenly cognizant of the resources and stratagems arrayed against him and Barbara. Indeed, when the millionaire crowns his efforts to persuade the young Greek scholar to become his successor with an apt paraphrase of Plato's philosopher-king prescription, Cusins admiringly registers the effec- tiveness of the ploy: "Oh, tempter, cunning tempter!" (p. 178). Actually Undershaft has successfully tempted the entire family - each member in a different way - primarily with the heavenly city enchant- ments of Perivale St. Andrews. In effect they all heed the Shavian admonition in the "Maxims for Revolutionists": "Never resist tempta- tion."43 The Lord's Prayer parody goes further: "Lead us into all sorts of temptations, and never say die." A clearer understanding of the intent of this counsel comes to us from an observation in one of Shaw's</page><page sequence="17">the lord's prayer and Major Barbara 123 religious speeches: "Temptation and inspiration mean the same thing exactly as firmness and obstinacy mean the same thing, only people use the one word when they want to be complimentary and the other when they want to be abusive."44 Hence Undershaft, as tempter, is by the same token an inspirer. Undershaft himself comments on temptation in his indictment of respectable people, like Jennie Hill or Stephen, for presuming compe- tence to teach morality and religion. "You cant tell me the bursting strain of a ten-inch gun, which is a very simple matter," he remon- strates, "but you all think you can tell me the bursting strain of a man under temptation" (pp. 150-51). Apparently he would make no such claim, but his performance as a highly skilled tempter suggests that he could justifiably do so. Concern with deliverance from evil is ubiquitous in Major Barbara. Lady Britomart addresses herself to it almost from the start, instructing her son in the proper aristocratic management of the wicked. He must learn to rise above the "state of dumb helpless horror" to which the middle classes are prone upon discovering that the world contains wicked people. "In our class, we have to decide what is to be done with wicked people; and nothing should disturb our self-possession" (p. 73). In imparting this lesson she depicts her estranged husband as a man committed to doing "every perverse and wicked thing on principle," in addition to always being "clever and unanswerable" in defense of "non- sense and wickedness" (p. 75). This portrait of Undershaft she then modifies by explaining that he was less disposed to wrongdoing than to wrong-speaking and wrong-thinking. Even his attractiveness to chil- dren she deplores, since it allowed him to fill their minds with wicked ideas, rendering them maternally "unmanageable" (p. 76). Undershaft portrays himself in the same act as "a profiteer in mutila- tion and murder," the meat of his morality being, as Cusins interprets for Lomax, moral poison to others (pp. 89-90). This prompts Barbara, as mentioned before, to look upon her father as a sinner (like all the others) whom she might guide to salvation. But before she can venture on that undertaking, the intrusive misconduct of Bill Walker brings her a more immediate soul-saving challenge. Her promising campaign to salvage his soul is foiled when both of them learn how utterly depen- dent is the Salvationist cause on the very forces of evil it is committed to combat. Those forces, represented by Bodger's whisky and the maim- ing munitions of her father, have in hand the money that confers decisive power over the institutions of society. In the circumstances we should hardly look to such powers for deliv- erance from evil. Yet that is not entirely true. For there are evils from which Undershaft himself would like to deliver us. He wants to rid the</page><page sequence="18">124 SIDNEY P. ALBERT world of the crime of poverty, which he describes as a moral and physical poison, a blight on cities, a murderer of souls, a destroyer of liberty, and a killer of social happiness. Poverty and slavery he would eliminate by force - by "killing" them. Cusins, in his final reflections on evil, concludes that power for good and power for evil are inextricably bound together, and that waging war on war is the way to deal with that particular evil. As for Barbara, she too has come to realize that "running away from" or "turning our backs on" wickedness is futile. Evil is inescapable; facing it is essential to life and salvation. Life, she perceives, is "all one," with no isolable "wicked side." "And," she would have Cusins know, "I never wanted to shirk my share in whatever evil must be endured, whether it be sin or suffering" (p. 183). The shunning of evil, instead of sharing it, she disdains as a middle class attitude - a sentiment recalling, but improv- ing upon, her mother's. The Lord's Prayer parody makes no mention of evil whatsoever, although its "never say die" may be a Shavian counsel of courage (or gumption) in facing and grappling with it. For Thine Is The Kingdom, And The Power, And The Glory, For Ever. Amen.45 Evidence enough has already been adduced to establish Undershaft's secure claim to both kingdom and power. In the heavenly-hellish city of Perivale St. Andrews he rules with regal ease, never needing to issue orders to his men, relying instead on the jealous exercise of authority over underlings at each rung of the industrial and social ladder. There he is engaged in "organizing civilization," as he implies to Stephen (p. 160). The foundation of his kingdom is religious: a creed of power promulgated in the apocalyptic commandments of "the true faith of an Armorer." Glory is Undershaft's not only as a prodigious economic and political force in the world, but in the end he acquires it as well in the enthusias- tic tributes of the visitors to his model community. In the denouement of Major Barbara the future of the kingdom and the power is being settled. The succession falls to Cusins, and through him to Barbara, after both come to terms with the "reality" of the place and its power. Cusins, "committed ... to this place for ever" (p. 182), will undertake to direct its physical and spiritual power to "the general good" (p. 181). Her courage regained, Barbara too has found her "place" and her work. Their inheritance of the kingdom and the power she celebrates with a rousing "Glory Hallelujah!" (p. 184). Adolphus Cusins, as successor, will become the next Andrew Under-</page><page sequence="19">the lord's prayer and Major Barbara 125 shaft. The Undershaft power and the glory, then, will endure in his kingdom come, where his will (and that of his step-sister wife, Barbara Undershaft) will be done. The long-standing dominion of "Andrew Undershaft" - the name of every overlord of Perivale St. Andrews since the reign of James I - may not last "for ever," but its continuation in the foreseeable future is assured. And certainly no one in the con- gregated family has any reason to withhold a confirming "Amen." Near the end of the second act, Cusins shouts exultantly "We convert everything to good here" (p. 135). In effect, Shaw does much the same, converting the Lord's Prayer to his own inspiriting purposes. By a typical Shavian inversion it becomes humanity's prayer, invoking and extolling the divine potentialities of humankind. Notes 1.

On one of the numerous occasions when he used one of his favorite scriptural phrases, "the Word was made flesh" (John 1:14) - although altered this time to "the Word became Flesh" - Shaw added parenthetically: "these old religious catchwords are the plainest common sense to me."

There are a number of other fairly straightforward allusions to scriptural passages in Major Barbara. Among the lines alluded to are the following: Philippians 4:7; Matthew 26:15; Joel 2:1 or 2:15; Proverbs 25:25; Psalms 22:1 or Matt. 27:46 or Mark 15:34; Matt. 18:6 or Mark 9:42 or Luke 17:2; Matt. 24:28; and Psalms 55:6. 21.

In the Appendix to Androcles (Collected Plays, IV, 639) Shaw states that for "the more modern sort of Anglican Theosophist to whom the Holy Ghost is the Élan Vital of Bergson" - as it is of course to him - "the Father and Son are an expression of the fact that our functions and aspects are manifold, and that we are all sons and all either potential or actual parents." 25. "Would you not be expecting this earth to be fulfilling its real destiny, to be transforming itself into the Kingdom of Heaven?" asks Shaw in "The Crime of Poverty," Platform and Pulpit, ed. Dan H.

Compare Shaw's own confessio fidei: "Aí for my own position, I am, and always have been, a mystic. I believe that the universe is being driven by a force that we might call the life-force.
