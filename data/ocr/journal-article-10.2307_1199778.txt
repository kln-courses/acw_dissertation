PETERS* ROCESS metaphysics may very well prove to be one of the most power- ful resources available to Chris- tian theologians of the twentieth cen- tury. It is important, of course, to be realistic in our expectations of a meta- physical system. There is no reason to expect, for example, that process meta- physics will provide a full-blown sys- tematic theology and thus do the theo- logian's work for him. Indeed, it cannot do so-any more than it can do the work of the biologist, the poet, or the statesman. The metaphysician depends for basic data on the experience, in- sights, and theories of specialists in the sciences and humanities. He himself as metaphysician could not produce such experience, insights, and theories, for he is working with (or toward) concepts which apply to any existing thing what- soever, and there is no possibility of leaping from such general concepts to special kinds of things or to particular facts. No one playing "Twenty Ques- tions" supposes that, if he knows an ob- ject to be animal rather than mineral or vegetable, he will, simply on the basis of that knowledge, be able to determine which animal it is. Nor ought anyone to suppose that a metaphysician can de- rive from his categories a description of the atom or the paramecium, an analysis of Shakespeare, a doctrine of human nature, or advice as to our next move in Southeast Asia. The metaphysician does not operate in a vacuum, isolated from every con- text, but draws upon particular areas of thought or experience to provide him clues to the whole of reality. Convinced that such and such facts are basic, he undertakes to generalize these facts, to give them-perhaps in a revised form- an applicability far beyond their ordi- nary boundaries. There can be little doubt that the Judeo-Christian heritage has been a resource for process philos- ophy, a resource of concept, imagery, and insight that-as surely as science, art, history, or philosophy-has in- formed and guided process thinkers. But while the process thinker, like any metaphysician, proceeds by de- scriptive generalization, and while he cannot possibly reverse the methodol- ogy and descend by some logical trick from the general to the special or to the particular, it is nonetheless true that all experience is received and interpreted in terms of some theoretical framework. Intelligence always functions to un- cover the structure or organization of experience, and it is a fair question whether experience is even possible * The author is professor of philosophy at Hiram College, Hiram, Ohio.

In any event, a metaphysical system can be regarded as the widest, the most general, framework of inter- pretation one can bring to his world. Suppose a Christian theologian adopts the perspective of process philosophy. What are some of the implications for his theological position? One of the most obvious implications, and at the same time one of the most important, is that he is thereby committed to what Daniel D. Williams calls the one-order theory of the world.' That is, a theo- logian operating within the framework of process philosophy will view the world, despite all its variety and di- versity, as a single, structured whole, each of its fundamental entities being occasions of experience. This means among other things that the process theologian will reject supernaturalism; he will deny that there is another- perhaps a wholly different-order or realm outside the world in which he ex- ists. All realities, he holds, share with one another a kinship so that no abso- lute barrier divides any of them from all the rest. It is easy to misinterpret this rejec- tion of supernaturalism. Process meta- physics is not the doctrine that the world is nothing but a system; it is the doctrine that the world is at least a sys- tem. There is no escaping the world order, even for God. Indeed, Whitehead declares that God is no exception to the metaphysical principles but is rather "their chief exemplification."2 Thus, the process theologian will not speak of miraculous, divine intervention in the world. He will try to conceive creation, incarnation, resurrection, and so forth, not as bewildering supernatural acts of God, which have little or no affinity with the structures and processes of the experienced world; rather, he will con- ceive these as expressions, in mythical or symbolic form, of facts which, how- ever religiously profound, are yet with- in the warp and woof of the world's single order. He will not use the Bible as a text in science and cosmology- for as such it is incompatible with his process world view (and besides the Bible is not that kind of book)-but he will accept it as the basic source of religious illumination and inspiration, and avail himself of every resource of biblical scholarship in order to discover its religious intent and significance. The process theologian stands within the liberal tradition of Christian thought, for while he is a man of faith, he holds that faith does not call for sacrifice of the intellect but rather demands to be made intelligible to the modern mind, a demand he seeks to fulfil within the framework of process metaphysics. I believe that much of the strength of process theology lies precisely in its rejection of otherworldliness. Insistence that God is "wholly other" tends to paralyze theological curiosity and in- quiry. No one should be expected to suppress questions as to the meaning of religious doctrine and simply "take things on faith." A man needs to un- derstand as clearly as possible what is meant by God's action in history, by his providential guidance, his self-reveal- ing, his suffering and redeeming. To re- ply simply that God's ways are past finding out is to give a stone where bread is needed. Indeed, the required nourishment can be given only when theology appeals by analogy to struc-</page><page sequence="3">376 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION tures, processes, or relations discovera- ble within human experience. Take an example or two. Theologians for centuries have spoken of the grace of God active in the hearts of men. They have spoken of the Holy Spirit moving in the world, particularly among the people of God. Now how is one to construe the divine influence so that it makes sense in terms of what one knows about the causal network of the world, or to be more specific, so that it makes sense in terms of what one knows about physiochemical, biologi- cal, psychological, sociological, politi- cal, and economic processes? Process theology, with its panpsychism (or psychicalism) and its doctrine of uni- versal relatedness, can answer such questions by reference to factors in the relation between God and the world which bear analogy to factors in the relation between a man and his body, in short, by reference to factors which by analogy have counterparts in con- crete human experience. Of course, I do not mean to suggest that theological doctrines have been nothing more than vague, incomprehensible formulas or unintelligible chants. Theologians have used personal imagery in describing God, have spoken of God as a loving father, have viewed the relation be- tween God and man as a covenant, and so forth. But while such analogies be- tween God and man have been helpful, they have not proven sufficient. Fur- thermore, there has been in theology a powerful countertendency to the con- ception of God as personal, namely, the tendency to regard God as radically unlike his creatures and (at least in some theologies) beyond any ascription whatsoever. This countertendency char- acterizes the main stream of classical Christian theology. Whitehead says that the ancient Christian theologians exhibited meta- physical imagination when they decid- ed for the immanence of God in Christ and also when they decided for the immanence of God as Holy Spirit in the world generally.3 However, "the nature of God was exempted from all the metaphysical categories which ap- plied to the individual things in this temporal world."4 This exemption re- sulted in a gulf between God and world, and as Whitehead remarks, "the worst of a gulf is, that it is very difficult to know what is happening on the further side of it."5 Here Whitehead is surely to the point. For what can possibly be known or said of God if he soars be- yond all concepts and all speech? At- tempting to exalt the Deity, theologians have at times denied that any term can be truly predicated of him. But thereby they have rendered him indistinguisha- ble from nothing at all. Again, theo- logians have at times held that since God is beyond any conceptuality, theo- logical language can only be symbolic. But what could such symbols signify, how could they convey us across a gulf separating us from utter mystery, and why would one symbol be any more ap- propriate than another-or than none at all? The problem of a divine being who transcends the metaphysical structure is a serious one. With respect to theo- logical language, the problem is that, no matter which words we choose, their meanings are grounded in the context of human thought and experience, and therefore they are inappropriate-in- deed, they are meaningless-when ap- plied to a being discontinuous with that</page><page sequence="4">A FRAMEWORK FOR CHRISTIAN THOUGHT 377 context. And with respect to theological knowledge, the problem is that God, if he transcends the metaphysical struc- ture, is inaccessibly beyond our know- ing or finding out, in which case we must resign ourselves to unrelieved ag- nosticism. The process theologian, in taking the tack that there is a single world order, for God as well as creatures, escapes the problems inherent in otherworldli- ness and enjoys the advantage of being able to anchor his theological reflection in human thought and experience. But the procedure of the process theologian involves its own set of problems, not the least of which is the problem of an- thropomorphism. For if God is part of the scheme of things, further, if he is literally a being of power, wisdom, and love, is he not an exalted (albeit imagi- nary) man rather than the Deity? This problem always dogs a theologian who finds analogy between the divine and the human. But as Hartshorne con- ceives it, the divine-human analogy is between whole and part, not between two parts. For God is the all-inclusive being-and in this sense is being-itself rather than one being among others. While there is analogy between God and man, there is also difference, in principle. For Hartshorne, God differs from man precisely in respect to those characteristics wherein he is also some- how like man! Let us examine more closely Harts- horne's understanding of the divine- human analogy. Some philosophers have argued against theism on the ground that the theist claims an anal- ogy between God and the human mind but destroys the alleged analogy by de- nying that God has a body.6 Hartshorne does nothing of the sort. He affirms that the world is to God as a man's body is to himself. But God is distinctive not only in that there is nothing outside his "body"-nothing of which he is only indirectly aware-but also in that he is perfect in his awareness of and influ- ence over that body. It follows "that theology (so far as it is the theory of the essence of deity) is the most literal of all sciences of existence."7 Indeed, it is when we deal with man and the other creatures that literalness is inappropri- ate, for man and the other creatures always embody characteristics ambigu- ously, approximately. Consider, for example, human knowl- edge. We say we know various things, but in each case our "knowledge" turns out to be something less than certain and conclusive; it is always a matter of more or less. But how far short of certainty and conclusiveness can one fall and still possess knowledge? Evi- dently, human "knowledge" has no ex- act or definite meaning. The case is different with divine knowledge, for God simply knows-period! His knowl- edge is utterly infallible-so that when we say God knows X, we mean this without qualification, that is, literally. The same is true of the other psy- chical conceptions. While in some vague sense they apply to man, they apply to God simply and literally. A man may be said to love his neighbor, but not quite, or at least with this or that quali- fication. God loves-period! A man re- members some fragments of the past. God remembers--period! A man may be said to endure, but only for a time. God endures-period! And so forth. "In this sense, it is the theistic use only of psychical conceptions which has lit- eral meaning, a meaning from which all other meanings are derived by quali-</page><page sequence="5">378 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION fication, diminution, or negation."' Thus, in regard to qualities wherein man is like God, divine eminence is pre- served in principle, God being the standard by which all human embodi- ments of those qualities must be meas- ured. This implies that we can arrive at knowledge of ourselves (and hence at a knowledge of our own defects) only to the extent that we attain a knowledge of God. Hartshorne ob- serves: "Our own natures it is which (partially) negate the categories, not God's [nature]."9 He, in his essence, is their literal embodiment or, to use Whitehead's words once more, "their chief exemplification." The moral to all this is, quite simply, that the affirma- tion of analogy between God and man need not anthropomorphize the deity or make God in the image of man. Hartshorne has shown that, though we find in man-and the other creatures- an analogue to the divine attributes, we are not obliged to identify divine with human nature but may conceive each as distinct (in principle) from the other. Since the categories apply unambig- uously to God and to him alone, they constitute his individuality, that is, they define his identity as God. The impli- cation is not only that God has a meta- physically unique status and character (as we have said) but that he can in his individuality or godhood be con- ceived a priori.'0 Your individuality or mine is not definable a priori, that is, solely by reference to universal cate- gories. Your individuality or mine, being a particular instance of characteristics shared in the same general way by mul- titudes, cannot be known simply by rea- son but must be experienced or felt as an empirical fact. But God, because the categories are his individuality, is known, however indistinctly, to the ex- tent that anyone is aware of those all- pervasive structures (categories) sought by the metaphysician. But doesn't such "natural theology" render revelation through Jesus Christ superfluous? It is evident that the proc- ess theologian must reject exclusive Christocentrism, which involves the doctrine that man can know God only through Christ. Respecting this point, two observations are especially rele- vant. First, one would be hard pressed to make a case for this doctrine on scriptural grounds. Indeed, as Schubert M. Ogden asserts: "Paul's conviction, like that of Scripture as a whole, is that men are utterly and radically respon- sible because God has always made himself known to them as gracious Father and has thereby deprived them of all excuse for their self-willed es- trangement from his holy presence."" In referring to "Paul's conviction," Ogden has in mind particularly Romans 1:18-21, where Paul insists that men who have failed to honor God or give him thanks cannot claim ignorance of him and thus be excused, for "they knew God." Ogden points out that, when Paul speaks of the revelation of God "in the things that have been made" (Rom. 1:20), he is referring not merely to the "concept of God" or to the "question concerning God" or to a purely "negative knowledge" or, in general, to something less than full knowledge of God. "On the contrary," says Ogden, "he affirms simply that 'what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them' [Rom. 1:19] and so leaves no doubt that the content of this primor- dial revelation is precisely identical</page><page sequence="6">A FRAMEWORK FOR CHRISTIAN THOUGHT 379 with the 'new' knowledge now to be laid hold of in the 'obedience of faith.' ,,12 Second, a doctrine of God, so far as it is Christian (that is, so far as it is based on Jesus Christ), will of neces- sity be in general accord with the under- standing of God in process thought. God cannot be disclosed in or through a person if he (God) utterly transcends the categories. Indeed, a Christian doc- trine of God, far from representing the deity as "wholly other," will scarcely avoid anthropomorphism. Of course, classical theologians avoided anthropomorphism by affirming that Christ, though one in person, pos- sessed two natures, the one divine and the other human. They were correct in denying a simple unity (or identity) between God and the human Jesus. For while there is unity between God and man, there must also be difference. However, the classical christological formulations were inadequate. No per- son can have two natures and still be one person.'3 In any event, a Christian doctrine of God must rest somehow on the history of Jesus-on his preaching and acts of healing; on his associations with fishermen, Pharisees, harlots, tax collectors, and all the rest; and on his eventual death on a cross. It is a his- tory which conveys unmistakably the impression of steadfastness and cour- age, but above all it conveys the im- pression of suffering love. It is a his- tory which for the Christian symbolizes nothing less than the love of God him- self-for "greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends." For the process theolo- gian, the doctrine of divine love, sub- limely symbolized in the life of Jesus, is the center about which all other con- siderations revolve. In this respect, process theism stands squarely within Christian faith. Still, if the divine essence is known to the extent that the categories are known, and further, if no human being can exemplify the categories eminently, can Jesus be regarded as the once-and- for-all, decisive, and normative disclo- sure of God? I must here pay tribute to Ogden, who has sought to work out a Christology by employing the analogy that the world is to God as a man's body is to himself.'4 Ogden's thesis is that, while all of one's bodily actions are his own, since to some extent they result from the inner decisions by which he constitutes himself a person or a self, some of his bodily actions, especially in interpersonal relations, are peculiar- ly his own. "Such actions are, as we say, our 'characteristic' actions, for in them or through them the persons we are, are uniquely re-presented or revealed to others."'5 In an analogous fashion, while all creatures are in one sense God's own acts, certain creaturely hap- penings may be said to be his acts in a special sense-a possibility "peculiarly open to those uniquely human events in which man expresses his understanding of the ultimate meaning of his existence through symbolic speech and action.""' Since Jesus, in both word and act, ex- presses the ultimate truth about human existence, namely, the truth that we are created and redeemed by God's sovereign love, Jesus himself is God's decisive act. "For in him, the word that he speaks and is, God's action as Creator and Redeemer is expressed with utter decisiveness."' Provocative as all this is, I am not persuaded that it is a satisfactory ac- count of the decisiveness of Jesus</page><page sequence="7">380 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION Christ, nor do I suppose that Ogden is entirely content with it. (1) One act of God is neither more nor less character- istic of him than any other such act; his acts are never "out of character." It is we men who reveal ourselves in a special, definitive way only in certain acts. God acts "as Creator and Re- deemer" in every case, not just on oc- casion. Indeed, if-as Ogden holds-- Jesus' history reveals "that all things have their beginning and end in God's pure unbounded love,""' then Jesus' history is an affirmation that God acts at all times and places in his character- istic, divine way. (2) While no creature escapes the persuasive influence of God, every creature enjoys a measure of autonomy, and in man autonomy is in principle at a maximum. It follows that a man's feelings, decisions, thoughts, interpretations, words, and deeds are in part his own and cannot in a strict sense be identified as God's acts. More- over, it may be argued that man, be- cause of his situation as a creature, acts in ways that are simply not open to God. For example, Jesus may resist temptation, but God, who is free of temptation, cannot. Resistance to temp- tation, then, is Jesus' act--but not God's. (3) If, as Ogden has it, God can act in history to reveal himself in a special sense, he can do so in various times and places. Hence, there is no reason to suppose that in Jesus we have the criterion "by which all putative revelations are at once judged and ful- filled.""9 Indeed, does not Ogden him- self lay the ax to this alleged criterion when he accepts the Pauline doctrine that the content of God's self-disclo- sure "in the things that have been made" is precisely identical with his self-disclosure in Jesus? As a related point here, I add that Ogden must be pressed to explain why, if Jesus expresses in word and deed a particular understanding of our life before God, it follows that he is the de- cisive act of God. For could one draw this conclusion unless on other grounds he already knew the character of God and his relation to man? On the other hand, if on other grounds one knew the character of God and his relation to man, this knowledge, not Jesus, would be decisive-and the only con- clusion to be drawn would be that by this criterion the particular understand- ing of our life before God expressed by Jesus in word and deed is valid. We have hit upon a problem which demands further consideration. A man must already know God in order to know that Jesus truly reveals him and is therefore decisive. But if one already knows God, it is this knowledge that is decisive, not the revelation in Jesus' history. Perhaps it will be said that one does not know that Jesus truly reveals God but only believes that he does; that consequently there is no reason to sup- pose a prior knowledge of God. It fol- lows, of course, that then one does not know that Jesus is decisive but only believes that he is. But the belief that Jesus is the decisive disclosure of God rests on prior belief about God. (Other- wise, why should a person not believe a quite different sort of man to be the decisive disclosure of God? Or, why should he not believe that Jesus is the decisive disclosure of a non-divine be- ing-or, possibly, no disclosure at all?) Such a prior belief about God, however, would itself be decisive, since it would constitute the criterion by which to judge the disclosure of God in Jesus. In general, it seems that one must</page><page sequence="8">A FRAMEWORK FOR CHRISTIAN THOUGHT 381 possess some notion of God-some knowledge or belief about God-before Jesus can become known to him as the revelation of God. In Jesus, we may say, a man becomes acquainted with some- thing he already knows, at least to some extent, or with something he al- ready believes. For the process theologian, God is known insofar as the categories or meta- physical principles are known, for they define God's essence. Since (as we have said) no man can exemplify the categories eminently, Jesus, like any creature, can manifest God's nature only in an approximate way. In short, he is not decisive in the sense that he embodies the divine essence. Perhaps, however, he is decisive in some other sense. For the essence or nature of God is not God in his fulness-in his con- creteness, in his actual states of expe- rience. While we may know God (in his essence or nature) with our minds, our words and concepts forever fail to express the divine fulness, which we but dimly feel. Reversing a tradi- tional theological affirmation, we may say that understanding seeks faith. That is, understanding, in order to compensate for its own abstractness and thereby do some justice to the con- creteness of its object, seeks an incar- nate expression of its insights into the divine. The fulness of God, vaguely sensed, can be appropriately repre- sented only by the concrete itself- ideally by a human being for (God is a personally ordered society of occasions, that is, a person, in Whitehead's tech- nical sense). Christians have discerned in Jesus the most adequate means of symbolizing the divine concreteness. He is a symbol not in speech, thought, or art, but in historical fact: a living sym- bol of the living God. To say then that Jesus is decisive is to confess some- thing like this: "The living God- though possessed of a character no man can possess-is imaged in the Man of Nazareth with a fulness and power that I find incomparable." Jesus is a lan- guage about God which for Christians speaks most faithfully and truthfully of its object. He is not the word (at least, not the word) of God to man but the word, in and through a man, about God. If the process theologian has not yet struggled through to an adequate Christology, he is doubtless in company with most theologians who take seri- ously modern advances in man's under- standing of himself and the world, and who can therefore no longer employ the traditional, orthodox formulations. Obviously, an exclusive Christocen- trism, which proclaims that God is known only through Jesus Christ, is not an option for the process theologian, for whom the humblest creature is related, however vaguely, to God. But I would insist that the process doctrine of God's immanence in all creatures, while it may pose problems for Christology, represents an insight of the highest im- portance for Christian theology. For process thought construes divine im- manence in analogy with concrete hu- man experience (in particular, in anal- ogy with the body's relation to the mind) and is thereby able to clarify not only the meaning of God's omni- presence but also the sense in which God creatively rules the world. Never before, so far as I am aware, has di- vine providence been explained so plainly and persuasively. Once a man sees that the world is composed of oc- casions of experience, he can under-</page><page sequence="9">382 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION stand that God-the universal datum- communicates his desires to the crea- tures by virtue of their own psychic participation in him, just as a human being in an analogous way communi- cates his desires to the cells in his body. We may say, therefore, that each creature knows God with an immediate love, and through this relation to God is guided by the inspiration of his aims and intentions for it. In this sense, God is creator. This does not, however, im- ply that creatures are without freedom, for within the context of God's direc- tives for it, each creature is self-deter- mining. A second theme of process thought which has special relevance for Chris- tian theology is that, while God-as we have just discussed-is immanent in the creatures, they are at the same time immanent in him. If the first theme illumines the meaning of God's provi- dential guidance of the world, the sec- ond illumines the meaning of his knowl- edge, love, and suffering, in a word, his sensitivity to the world. "There are," says Hartshorne, "no gradations in the intimacy of things to God."'20 Or more vividly: "God has nowhere to hide himself from any sorrow or joy whatever, but must share in all the wealth and all the burden of the world."21 Though this doctrine is deep- ly rooted in scripture, it has at times been resisted by theologians, since it implies that God is relative to or de- pendent on the creatures. The process theologian frankly and gladly accepts this implication. After all, failure to be influenced is nothing but failure to take account of others, which in one context means ignorance and in anoth- er, indifference. Far from exhibiting impassivity, God, since he is omnis- cient and omnibenevolent, is eminently passive or sensitive. A man's awareness of his own body furnishes the best ana- logue to the divine passivity. While such awareness is direct, and in this respect God-like, it is indistinct and of course limited to one tiny fragment of the total universe, and in these respects is un-God-like. By virtue of his unquali- fied passivity, God includes in himself all things precisely as they are. This means that no man sorrows alone and that none rejoices alone. It means, as Hartshorne observes, that "to wish something is to wish that God might be or have something; to regret some- thing is to regret that God is or has it. All functions are God-functions.,"22 It means that in God there are trag- edy and suffering-an insight to be found in both the Old and the New Tes- taments. A third theme of importance to Chris- tian theology follows directly from the second. All events, since they are known infallibly by God, are preserved or re- tained in his life everlastingly. They are immortalized in the divine memory. This doctrine, acording to Ogden, pro- vides "a way to demythologize such important theological notions as 'resur- rection' and 'everlasting life.' 1"23 In ad- dition, the doctrine suggests what is meant by the concept of God as re- deemer. As Ogden puts it, to say that God acts as redeemer is to say "that the final destiny both of myself and of all my fellow creatures is to contribute ourselves not only to the self-creation of the subsequent worlds of creatures but also to the self-creation of God, who accepts us without condition into his own everlasting life, where we have a final standing or security that can nevermore be lost."24 Thus, in receiv-</page><page sequence="10">A FRAMEWORK FOR CHRISTIAN THOUGHT 383 ing and conserving all things, God is the redeemer of all, just as in communi- cating his desires to all things, he is the creator of all. Here again we appeal to concrete human experience to pro- vide an analogue by which to conceive God; indeed, the only process we know by which the past is preserved is mem- ory-though in God memory has an eminent form (is complete and accu- rate), while in man (and other crea- tures) it is always deficient. A fourth theme comes to mind: that of creaturely freedom and responsibil- ity. For if God is the perfectly sensi- tive recipient of every event, he does not fully determine them and therefore some power of decision or enactment resides in each event. Process thought not only takes seriously the concept that "creation continues"; it sees crea- tivity as the most fundamental of meta- physical principles and hence charac- teristic of every individual reality. It follows that the creatures are also crea- tors! Of course, God has created us. But, as Hartshorne says, if he "has created even our decisions, then in what sense are they our decisions?"25 God determines the creature only in part, leaving at least some alternatives for its own detemination. Man enjoys far greater freedom than does any other creature. He "is capable of departing widely from his proper place in the scheme of things, making himself, as it were, less than a man."26 At worst, man arrogates to himself functions and privileges that belong only to God. "We should like to seem infallible, omnipo- tent, absolutely righteous, at least in some sphere."277 Of course, process theologians are aware of an ancient theological truth, "that somehow it is deeply natural to man to prefer the lesser or narrower to the greater or more generous objec- tive."28 To some extent, this tendency qualifies human freedom and thus hu- man responsibility. Hence, the old ques- tion is raised: is man really capable of the good, or is he morally weak- kneed and therefore dependent on God's grace? The process theologian, though he does not gloss over man's natural tendency to sin, insists in his answer to this question (1) that human freedom is never inoperative or incon- sequential-so long as one is in com- mand of his faculties-and (2) that, however extensive his freedom may be, man can never act apart from the sus- taining power of God. While we cannot of our own strength rise to full human stature, we can of our own strength- that is, consciously and willingly-ac- cept "the operation in us of the love which infinitely transcends but inspires our own.''29 It is important to recog- nize that full human stature is never divine stature, that our love is forever less than perfect. But the sense that we cannot love as God loves, while it humiliates us, may also "save" us from failure to love as we can. To fill one's mind with the thought of the divine, not as coldly perfect or blandly benevolent, but as tragically sympathetic, more at one with us in our grief than we can be with each other, or even with our own past experiences (which we, but not God, have largely forgotten) is to find selfish desires and pride losing some of their charm.30 The discussion of creaturely freedom and responsibility presupposes the re- latedness of creatures and thus suggests a fifth theme with theological relevance, namely, that each individual is a di- polar, mental-physical unity. For the relation among creatures is never a purely spiritual affair-as though crea-</page><page sequence="11">384 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION tures (at least the most exalted) were pure, non-bodily spirits in communion with one another. Williams has this point in mind when he remarks that much of the talk about the "I-Thou" relationship dodges the really hard problems. "We are not disincarnate spirits in 'I-Thou' relations," he says. "We are human beings embedded in organic and physical processes, and the mystery of man is how the 'I-Thou' relationship appears in this setting."3' Of course, one's relation to another creature is not merely a relation to another particular, localized mental- physical unity; it is at the same time a relation to God himself-in accordance with the second theme. This solves the ostensible puzzle as to how one could love the neighbor in addition to God if he were to love God, as the Christian is commanded, with all his heart, mind, soul, and strength. For the neighbor is not "in addition to God," but literally included within his very life. "That other fellow (of whatever social class) whose sonship to God we may abstract- ly admit, is not just a product of divine power, or just an object of divine well- wishing, but a very fragment of the life of God which is made all-incluSive through sympathy."32 At last is is clear why, if we do or fail to do to "the least of these," we also do or fail to do to God. The process view that man (like oth- er creatures) is a mental-physical unity represents a restatement of the Hebraic understanding of man, which is best expressed in the Old Testament. The view is at odds with the Greek concep- tion of man as a soul, temporarily and accidentally associated with a body. On the Greek interpretation of human na- ture, the doctrine that man is made in the image of God really makes sense only if God is conceived as a soul; on the Hebraic interpretation of human nature, that doctrine really makes sense only if God is conceived as a psychic- somatic unity-as, of course, he is in process theology. This account of process themes hav- ing special relevance for Christian the- ology is by no means exhaustive. It perhaps suggests the richness of process philosophy as a context or framework for theological thought. In any event, process philosophy represents a new alternative for the theological world, one which renders obsolete many an old discussion of theology's relation to philosophy. For in light of the achieve- ments of process philosophers, certain stereotypes regarding the structure and limits of philosophy are now seen to be premature and arbitrary. Because of the new situation afforded by process philosophy, theology has an opportu- nity to enter a new phase in its relation with philosophy; indeed, it has a golden opportunity. NOTES 1.

This is not to deny the need for symbolic speech about God. God is not literally a shepherd, a lord, or a father. But such usage does not belong to the pure theory of the divine essence. 8.

It is possible for two persons (personally ordered societies, in Whitehead's terminology) to possess the same categorial nature, though one pos- sess it eminently and the other non-eminently or deficiently. The sameness and difference between God and man is to be understood in this way. 14. See Ogden, "What Sense Does It Make To Say, 'God Acts in History'?"
