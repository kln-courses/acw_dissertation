<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS OF BOOKS THE THOUGHT OF C. S. PEIRCE. By THOMAS A. GOUDGE. Toronto, University of Toronto Press, I950. PP. xiv, 360. $5.50. This book is at once a survey of Peirce's thought and an attempt to establish, in -the course of that survey, the following hypothesis: "Peirce's temperament ... harbored a conflict which exhibits itself philosophically in the espousal of two incompatible sets of premisses for his thought. One of these is his naturalism; the other is his trans- cendentalism" (p. 5). The body of the book is, accordingly, divided into two sections: "Peirce's Naturalism" (238 pages) and "Peirce's Transcendentalism" (75 pages). A concluding chapter, "Peirce's Ca- reer," sketches the factors of "background, training, personal associ- ations, and mental development" which Professor Goudge believes ac- count for the radically opposite tendencies in his thinking. The exposition of Peirce's views is, on the level of detail, quite re- liable. Moreover, many of the notices of discrepancies between state- ments, of shifts in the meanings of terms, and of other matters of that order are interesting and useful. Yet the larger picture of Peirce - the picture of Peirce bifurcated - is, in my opinion, a somewhat distorted one. This is not to say that there are no major inconsistencies in Peirce's thought. But these inconsistencies are not adequately revealed through the use of the naturalist-transcendentalist dichotomy as Goudge defines and applies it. This apparatus has also, I think, made it impossible sometimes for Goudge to make clear to his readers what there is of integration in Peirce's thought. By naturalism Goudge means the following set of principles: scien- tific method is the only means of obtaining knowledge; theory and practice are inseparable; "conceptual precision" is important in phi- losophy; Platonic realism is not plausible; "man is a product of the natural world, with which he is continuous, and his philosophical account of that world requires the use of non-subjective or non- personal categories"; "a prior modes of thought about matters of fact are illegitimate"; any systematic explanation of "the nature of the world" is suspect; and "the conclusions of philosophy must be broadly compatible with the ideas of common sense" (p. 6). Transcendental- ism consists virtually of the contradictories of the above principles, except that the following are special cases: "feeling, sentiment, or in- stinct" are primary sources of knowledge; "metaphysical construction is a more significant activity than logical analysis"; and "since man's 249</page><page sequence="2">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW inner life provides him with the truest insights into the nature of the universe, he may properly interpret the latter in terms of highly per- sonal or anthropomorphic categories" (p. 6). What the crucial terms of these descriptions mean is in most cases not fully explained, and this fact itself is in part responsible for the deficiencies of Goudge's interpretation. "Scientific method" is a good example. It involves, of course, among other things, that our beliefs should be "validated observationally." But it would be good to know more exactly how this criterion was used to distinguish between that part of Peirce's metaphysics that is admitted to rank as naturalist, and the other part which, depending only on a priori and anthropomorphic modes of thought, is transcendentalist. We are not told, either, what entitles Goudge to group the premises of each set together, as in some sense belonging together, and as resulting from a temperamental disposition. The significance of associating the term naturalism with premises which (Goudge believes) are scientifically warranted and of calling transcendentalist "all the beliefs which he [Peirce] affirms on grounds other than those of scientific method" (p. 25 ) is also obscure, though it is evident that some important philosophical decisions are behind it. There seems, at any rate, to be something about these categories which makes them unsuitable for conveying several of Peirce's central and most characteristic ideas. What happens, in more than one case, can fairly be described as a forcing of the naturalist-transcendentalist division into a concept unable to survive that strain. The following may serve as an example: Goudge claims to show that Peirce has two conflicting doctrines on the character of "experience" as the source of knowledge. On the one hand, it is alleged (p. 266), Peirce some- times regarded experience as "wholly non-cognitive." Yet he is sup- posed to have held, on other occasions, that "experience is the result of the functioning of the mind" (p. 267). The former view is, of course, naturalist, the latter transcendentalist. Since naturalism and transcen- dentalism are incompatible, this is as far as Goudge needs to go in the matter. Now these two interpretations of experience are so obviously incompatible that it seems likely that if Peirce ever adhered to them both it was, at least, not on the same occasions. Goudge does, indeed, say that Peirce maintained the two positions in different "contexts." The fact is, however, that Goudge's illustrations of these mutually exclusive doctrines are, as often as not, taken from the same contexts and, in three cases, from identical paragraphs (2.I4I, 5.539, and 6.492) of the Collected Papers. This requires us to suppose either that Peirce was remarkably inattentive to what he was writing or that .(sometimes, at least) he thought he was saying something different from either of the two propositions Goudge attributes to him. In sup- 250</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS OF BOOKS port of the latter alternative here is one of Peirce's statements on the topic: "Experience means nothing but just that of a cognitive nature which the history of our lives has forced upon us" (5.539). Certain features of phenomena are, I think Peirce is saying, forced upon us in the sense that they plainly are what they are regardless of our wishes. It is this element of compulsiveness which makes the difference be- tween fact and fancy. But what is thus thrust upon us is in some respects meaningful ("of a cognitive nature"). Thus experience is neither "wholly non-cognitive" nor simply a "mental product." It is to this interpretation of experience that Peirce is committed in at least one context, that is, the later theory of pragmatism. And in that con- text, at least, it is just the two doctrines described by Goudge which Peirce must - and knows he must - avoid. He cannot allow that our encounter with the external world in perception is nothing more than a blind clash of ego with nonego. Such a transaction would not be one between knower and known, but one between sheer will and sheer resistance to will. In this there would be found no datum by reference to which any judgment at all could be either confirmed or discon- firmed. For a judgment always refers partly to some sort of thing. That a thing is of a certain sort is a matter, not of any individual re- action of the thing in a particular situation, but of a general disposition of the thing to a certain sort of behavior. Such a disposition is, on Peirce's theory, precisely an intelligible character of the thing. It is a rule or law of the thing's behavior. If experience is ever relevant to any of our judgments, then, it must in part be experience of intelligible aspects of things. No more is Peirce willing to admit, in his writings on pragmatism, that the thinker simply produces what he experiences. Peirce does, of course, hold that all thought is carried on by the use of signs and that the use of signs is a type of activity or of disposition to action on the part of a thinker. This is not, however, to say that the thinker produces what he experiences. And Peirce is careful to disavow the doctrine that only the fully intelligible is real. Thirdness, or generality, is another key concept of Peirce's which does not, as I see it, come through to the reader of this volume. When the idea in its naturalist "moment" is being set forth, it is so watered down that it does not correspond to what Peirce had in mind during the period when he was making the greatest use of the notion. All non- naturalist connotations (including some which I think are of first importance to Peirce), on the other hand, are given short shrift sim- ply because they are transcendentalist. For example, Peirce's statement that "general principles are really operative in nature" is shrugged off as anthropomorphic; and Peirce's reasons for affirming the reality of "generals" never get across successfully. Goudge's distrust of anthro- 25I</page><page sequence="4">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW pomorphic ideas prevents him from taking seriously Peirce's attempts to explain Thirdness by the use of the concept of purpose. It is just this mode of explanation, I believe, that most readily leads to a glimpse of what Peirce has in mind. Suppose I intend to make an apple pie. What I intend is (or at least may be) simply to make an apple pie - a sort of thing - rather than some particular thing, resulting from a particular set of acts relative to a particular batch of ingredi- ents. If my intention is thus general, then the reality of my intention consists, not merely in its being the first event in a wholly mechanically determined series of events - for this would produce one particular thing and not any other - but in its determining that future events will be of a certain sort. Now Peirce maintains that if it is ever true to assert something of a general nature something, that is, about the sort of behavior of some sort of thing then there must be a mode of determination of events which has in common with purpose that it determines not precisely what will happen but what sort of thing will happen. This theory may or may not be true. But it at least deserves fuller statement and more thorough consideration than Goudge has been able to give it. Here again the fault seems to lie with Goudge's commitment to a system of classification which excludes altogether the sort of thinking Peirce sometimes does. There are for Goudge only two conceivable points of view on the question of the reality of univer- sals. Unfortunately, neither happens to coincide with the position which Peirce took (or at least tried to take) in some of his best- developed arguments. The most disappointing feature of the book is the treatment of pragmaticism itself. There are six pages on "the pragmatic interpreta- tion of signs," two pages on the "subservience" of the pragmatic maxim "to the summum bonum," and a few references scattered else- where. Of the systematic connections between the ideas of pragmati- cism, Thirdness, habit, purpose, and the perceptual judgment - con- nections which are sketched laboriously if incompletely in the later papers on pragmaticism - little is said. These objections made -and they reflect, of course,' but another interpretation of the thought of Peirce- it remains to be said that the merits of the book are considerable. The documentation is ac- curate, the coverage comprehensive. Much of the volume has to do with topics which can be and are dealt with independently of the nat- uralist-transcendentalist hypothesis. At the least estimate, this is a valuable handbook to the study of Peirce's writings. W. E. SCHLARETZKI Cornell University 252</page></plain_text>
