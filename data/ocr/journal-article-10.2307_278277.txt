<plain_text><page sequence="1">CULT TRAITS IN SOUTHEASTERN COSTA RICA AND THEIR SIGNIFICANCE DORIS STONE ABSTRACT The finding of ceremonial bone and shell objects at Puntarenas Farm, Jalaca, southeastern Costa Rica, along with ceramics of known Chiriqui or Red and Black ware, has thrown new light upon the extent of pre-Columbian trade and the penetration of cult traits from northern South America into lower Central America. Although no radiocarbon date has been obtained as yet, it is known that the manufacture of Chiriqui or Red and Black ware was continued into post-Columbian times. The presence in this region of shells found only on the Caribbean coast of Central America and not on the Pa- cific, as well as artifacts of manatee (Trichechus m. mana- tus Linn.) bone, also associated solely with the Carib- bean littoral, indicate the extent and importance of trade. In the same sense, the appearance of the alligator-serpent motif on both coasts of the Nicoya Peninsula and on the western coast with ware related to Ulua Polychrome types and with an Ulua style alabaster vase, places a new north- ern boundary with respect to the diffusion of this cult motif. The Ulua Polychrome types and the Ulua style alabaster vase put a time horizon covering from A.D. 1000 probably to the Spanish arrival. The alligator-serpent concept, so familiar in the Amazon and Andean regions, the "eagle" or "condor" concept, the feline, the monkey, and the frog all emphasize the common base of lower Central American religion. Likewise they point to San Agustin as a cultural center of great importance in lower Central America. From the artistic point of view, the bone objects repre- sent some of the most intricate carving yet known in east- ern Central America. Both the style and subject matter place these figures in a different category from bone arti- facts associated with Mesoamerican cultures. HISTORICAL DATA supply little informa- tion regarding religious cults in Costa Rica at the time of the Spanish conquest beyond that which refers to the Nicoya region. Descriptions of certain Chorotega-Mangue ceremonies and the highly developed pantheon of Nicarao gods, as well as some corresponding rituals, are to be found in a few early sources. The religious be- liefs and customs of the other habitants of Costa Rica, however, do not seem to have attracted the pen of too many conquerors. In the east, in the section known today as Talamanca, gold idols were kept in prayer houses (Fernandez 1882, II: 152). There were also images of stone and wood (Fernandez 1882, II: 152, Fernandez 1886, V: 156-7) served by witch doctors, often through oracles. The ceremonial areas of the southeast were connected with fortified sites. Human sacrifice by decapitation was prevalent, and although gold figures were common, the only indication of their use is as objects of adornment (Fernandez Guardia 1908: 35-8). There is one mention of a mummy house near the actual site of Limon (Colon 1947: 282), but the scarce historical reports refer in the main to funeral rites with emphasis on physical mani- festations instead of the spiritual or religious ideas behind the pomp and feasting. Recent archaeological finds in a graveyard two kilometers north of Finca Puntarenas, Jala- ca, near Esquinas, southeastern Costa Rica (Fig. 1), have yielded very unusual and previously unreported artifacts, singular in their artistic value, which bring more light on cult practices in this area and their relationship to other areas of Costa Rica and abroad. Jalaca is a region of heavy rains. Records show an average of 600 centimeters per year. It is, therefore, surprising that this cemetery should have contained a quantity of shell, animal bones, and remains of human skeletons. The graves were dug in yellow clay along the ridge of a mountain spur, and measured from 1 to 5 meters in depth. The deepest ones were empty. The only markers were large, unworked limestone slabs, one at each end of a line of burials. Most graves were formed by a level of limestone gravel varying in thickness from 30 cm. to 3 m., below which black earth brought from the plain was used as a fill. In some cases, five or six limestone slabs were laid directly on top of the skeletons. This is often seen in the Atlantic watershed of Costa Rica. Only what appears to have been the principal tomb was oriented in an east-west line, with the head of the occupant lying at the east. One body was allotted to a burial and, except for grave furni- ture, was wedged in as close as possible with the arms extended alongside and the head fac- ing upward. In four graves the skeletons were decapitated, some without a sign of the head, and others with pieces of skull bone and teeth. A number of the interments were of children. GRAVE FINDS Metal, bone, shell, pottery objects, one resin piece, and some grinding stones were found in association with the burials. 339</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY sF SAN JOSE 0 CARTAGO JALACA O PUNITA,RBNS .* / 0 0 z / I O/ C0 ,\I i- FIG. 1.

Contrary to most of the Diquis region, where high-carat gold is usual, almost all the metal found at Jalaca was tumbaga. The exceptions were three small pieces of 18-carat gold, a bell, a rattle, and an "eagle." The metal objects were located around the neck of skele- tons and obviously served as adornments. The majority of the tumbaga figures were spread- wing "eagles" in different sizes (Fig. 2 a-c). A few hold small animals in their beaks and one with a doubleheaded crocodile headdress carries an iguana (Fig. 2 a), while another has a human face in its belly similar to certain pendants from Veraguas, Panama (Lothrop 1950: 58, Fig. 75), and also has a fish in its mouth. Stylized metal "eagles" occur throughout Caribbean and south- eastern Costa Rica as well as Chiriqui and Vera- guas, Panama, but are rare in the Nicoya region. Resin and jadeite "eagles" are found in the At- lantic watershed along the Linea Vieja. Among the tumbaga pieces were also a turtle holding a rope in his two front flippers and mouth (Fig. 2 e), and a small human figure (Fig. 2 d). Ceramics. (The pottery classification is based on the terms used by Stone 1958.) All pottery was placed at the feet and sides of the head of the skeleton with the exception of a single glob- ular vessel 7.5 cm. in diameter. Although there were unpainted pots, some semicylindrical in form with a slightly out- turned rim, and others globular without han- dles, the common ware is typical of Chiriqui province, Panama, and the Diquis region, Costa Rica. It is known by the different names of "Alligator," Chiriqui, and Red and Black, and has been found in Costa Rica with iron tools of European origin (Stone 1958: 48), evidence of its continuation into post-Columbian times. Cylindrical and globular forms, usually with three legs often painted to represent animal heads, dominate. Singular pieces include an unpainted vessel with appliqued frogs rising from the side to the rim in lieu of handles and with bulbous legs as alligator head effigies topped with a flying bird (Fig. 3 b); a highly polished vessel (Highly Pol- ished ware), Chiriqui type, with two mouths, each rimmed with a ropelike band and with two bird heads appliqued on the body; a small amphora-shaped jar with four appliqued frogs, two on each side (Fig. 3 a), belonging to the style called Partially painted with Red ware common to the Atlantic watershed; and a glob- ular vessel with a white background, two black bands, and a red rim. Inside were worked bones and shell including the carved jaguar shown in Fig. 22. Two pots were found which suggest a combination of influences. One is a two-legged vessel with modeled wings, tail, head, and breast representing a king vulture (Fig. 3 d). The slablike stylization of the feet and the painted pattern are typical of Red and Black ware, but the modeled form recalls specimens from Veraguas, Panama. The other piece is an amphora-shaped Red ware vessel with tiny applique rope design handles similar to Red monochrome applique ware characteristic of the Atlantic watershed. The pot is supported on the necks of three female figures with the con- ventionalized triangular heads and painted motifs of Red and Black ware (Fig. 3 c). Some vessels contained two- and four-toned ocarinas of distinct shapes decorated in Red and Black patterns (Fig. 4). Some were tapirs, both with a single and with a double head; jaguars with a single and with multiple heads; wild pigs; crabs; drums; a standing bird; toplike figures; and snakes and owls. There was one Black Line ocarina in the form of a tapir (Fig. 5 a). Black Line ware is usual in the Atlantic watershed, particularly in Talamanca. Hollow clay figurines of Red and Black ware consist of tapirs, spread-leg conventionalized fe- males, and one anthropomorphic female with a tail. There were two curious solid figurines of seated jaguars with the front paws and the tail turned upward (Fig. 5 b). These are painted red and covered with punctate dots to simulate spots. A crudely incised line forms the mouth. Punctate eyes were made with a downward movement forming a line which at the same time indicates the sides of the nose. Resin. One small effigy of a jaguar was carved out of resin and deposited in a vessel. Stone Work. There were eight rimless, un- decorated grinding stones with vestiges of three crude legs. Three four-legged grinding stones, with a protruding jaguar head and tail charac- teristic of this region, Chiriqui, and Veraguas, Panama, and also seen on the Costa Rican At- lantic watershed, and two with a protruding jaguar head at each end, were found. Shell objects. (The shell classification was made by the Department of Crustaceans, American Museum of Natural History, New York.) Many of the shells associated with these burials are indicative of the importance of trade. STONE J 341</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY FIG. 2. Tumbaga figures. Length of a, 6.5 cm.

The majority came from Caribbean waters and include the following specimens: Charonia variagata Lamarck; Strombus pugilis nicaraguen- sis Fluck; and three species of Oliva, only one of which is found on both the Pacific and Carib- bean coasts (Fig. 6). There was also Arcidae sp. known only on the Pacific coast. This shell was cut smoothly at the widest edge, suggesting its use as a scraper. All of the Oliva sp. seem to have formed part of necklaces. Generally the larger ends of the smaller ones were cut for grad- ing, with the biggest shell left for the front. All were perforated near the uncut end or perpen- dicularly through the tip itself. Holes were drilled at both extremes of the Charonia varia- gata Lamarck, which appears to have been em- ployed as a horn. Spondulus calcifer Carpenter shells were cut into circular and elongated 342 [ VOL. 28, No. 3, 1963</page><page sequence="5">CULT TRAITS IN COSTA RICA beads and ornaments. Many of the beads simu- lated the canine teeth of animals (Figs. 7-8). Only a few shell figures from this graveyard represent a bird or animal. The principal dec- orative motif associated with these adornments is the frog. There are innumerable variations from the whole amphibian with widespread legs, the legs or head alone, stylizations of any or all of these units, and a form which may be a pollywog. Some frogs have a line of squares down the back; others, incised crossed lines. Most, however, are plain. In the Diquis region, the frog is known in bone, as we shall see later; in clay, but limited to the conventionalization associated with Chiriqui or Red and Black ware; and in gold, always in the style of Chiriqui. The applique and incised ware, so typical of the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica and found from the Amazon basin to the Aguan River in Honduras, is frequently decorated with frogs. Frogs also occur in jadeite on the Costa Rican Atlantic watershed and in gold and resin on both sides of the cordillera, even though resin frogs are common on the Pacific and rare on the Atlantic. Shell figures of frogs similar to those of Jalaca come from Las Pozas de San Vicente, Nicoya, and are in the Costa Rican National Museum. They are stylistically related to "Pachacamac" or early Inca types. Teeth. Unworked human teeth were found in clay vessels in certain graves. Canine teeth of white-faced boars (Tagassus pecari) were perforated near the center or at the tip, and neatly trimmed when necessary so that they lie well as a necklace. Most are undecorated but some have a geometrical pattern, at least on one side, and at the perforated or root end (Fig. 28 b). Miscellaneous bone objects. (The identifica- tion of animal bones was made by Dr. John de Abate, Department of Microbiology, University of Costa Rica.) Deer (Odocoileus virginianus) antlers, deer femurs, and the canine teeth of white-faced boars had their use as tools or or- naments (Figs. 11-12). Among the bone arti- cles were small balls, smoothly polished and rounded, similar to the clay balls used today in Costa Rica for blowguns (Fig. 14 d), and plain stubby, spool earplugs (Fig. 14 c). The balls appear to have been made from manatee (Trichechus m. manatus Linn.) bones. This mammal does not live in Pacific waters, his habitat being the Caribbean coast. Nine spindle whorls, each different in shape and only two with decoration, were found. The bottom half of both of the decorated ones is plain except for two incised lines which form a border. The remaining half has a cross pattern which divides the spindle whorl into four parts. On one whorl these parts are crosshatched (Fig. 13 b), and on the other, incised lines form a triangular decoration with a perforated dot at the base (Fig. 13 a). Eyeless, bobbin-like imple- ments (Fig. 14 a-b), such as those employed by the actual Indians of Costa Rica and Panama to make pita-thread (Agave sp.) carrying bags, are probably of deer bone. There were four solid, cylindrical seals carved in high relief. The design on two consists of two panels, each containing a stylized serpent (Figs. 15 b, 22 a). The designs at the ends are too badly weathered to interpret. Another seal (Fig. 15 c) has a broad-stripe, basketweave pat- tern interspersed with diamond shapes, each with an indented dot in the center which cre- ates the impression of a conventionalized eye. The remaining seal (Fig. 15 a) has graceful twining lines, the intervening spaces filled with spots cut in high relief. The designs on these last two seals and that on Fig. 22 a recall ser- pent patterns. None bear traces of paint. Motifs and techniques. The decorative motifs seen on the bone articles, besides textile or geo- metric patterns, consist of monkey, jaguar, ar- madillo, bird, anthropomorphic, serpent, frog, and human figures. Most figures are conven- tionalized, but the man in Fig. 16 a, in spite of the stylized facial conformation, suggests an at- tempt to portray a given individual perhaps in a ritualistic action. The figures generally are carved in the round. Many have either the lower arms or the legs free. The textile patterns and usually indica- tions of limbs, features, hair, and fingers are cut in low bas relief. Sometimes the limbs and back have incised lines which create a sense of move- ment or shadow. Some heads are cut in high relief in totemic fashion on the body of figures. Gouging of the bone to free certain details and drilling, particularly to make holes for suspen- sion or fastening, were practiced. It is possible that this was accomplished by using sand, water, and a dry animal or fish bone, or hard stone implement on fresh bone, which has the advantage of being easy to work and is not brittle. Sawing with pita thread and an abra- sive could also have been employed. STONE ] 343</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY FIG. 3. Vessels from Jalaca. Length of a, 10 cm. Antlers. Antlers were found both unworked and worked. Some of the decorated ones seem to have been used as heads or butts on wooden staffs or scepters, while others were designed for pendants. The term "butt" is chosen because the most elaborately carved antler, Figs. 17 and 18, the same piece, is so designed that if placed as a head, the sculpture would be upside down. It might of course have been planned for the head of a scepter or ceremonial staff in- tended to be held horizontally. Historical docu- mentation points to intricately carved wooden staffs used as emblems of power by messengers of non-Mesoamerican chiefs in lower Central America (Fernfandez de Oviedo 1855, IV: 37-8). The carving of this piece is in the manner of a totem pole and follows the physical form of the antler. The top or largest figure is sculp- tured out of the base and is a standing, slightly bent-knee male with the stylized head of the al- ligator god wearing a crownlike headdress. 344 [ VOL. 28, No. 3, 1963</page><page sequence="7">CULT TRAITS IN COSTA RICA FIG. 4. Ocarinas, Red and Black ware. Length of c, 9.5 cm. (There are only crocodiles in Costa Rica, but vulgarly they are called alligators [Crocodylus acutus].) At the top of this are holes for fasten- ing the object to a shaft. A serpent's body with a head at each end borders the upper portion of the face of the alli- gator god. The upturned forked tongue of an- other snake protrudes from the bottom of the god's mouth, but part of its body is cut free and held in his two hands directly above his protruding stomach. The remaining portion en- circles the god (Fig. 18), forming the nose of a face at the rear when the antler is turned upside down. The back of the figure is carved in high relief but badly weathered (Fig. 17 b). Hori- zontally at the top is a serpent with a split or profile head pointing downward and inward at each end. These form the rest of the face noted when the antler is turned upside down. The antler is cut away slightly around the base of the legs. The right leg rests without a foot on the body of a two-faced serpent crown- ing a seated jaguar (Fig. 18 a) turned sideways so that his left side corresponds to the front of the alligator god (Fig. 17 a).

Length of largest specimen, 21 cm. of one and touching the serpent's body which crowns the feline, is the left foot of the alligator god. The jaguar creates a sense of grace in contrast to the stolid anthropomorphic figure. The head is bent downward with the chin supported by a peg connected to the inner portion of the top of the closed hands (Figs. 17, 18) which turn slightly upward almost forming a point. Here another and longer peg is connected to the chin of an animal whose head is so badly damaged that it is impossible to identify (Fig. 17 a-b). It has legs, no feet, but a downward-pointing tail. The natural shape of the antler narrows here, and the tail blends into and becomes the tail of another seated feline. At the same time, what appear to be two circular eyes and a brow or top of a head are cut in low relief where the tail rises from the buttocks, while still another head is incised at the small of the back. Deep incised lines indicate hanging hair. The tip of the antler is cut off so that the flat head of the jaguar forms the end. The opposite narrow side has the front view of this animal (Figs. 17 b, 18 b). The upper por- tion is broken, but there are signs of hollow round eyes. The incised canine teeth are evi- dent, and between them a serpent's body ex- tends downward and is sustained at the sides by the feline's hands, the head resting on the jaguar's stomach, which is cut away at the limbs. The feet with incised toes are on top of a downward-pointing alligator head, with the eyes, flat nose, and teeth in low relief (Fig. 18 b). This in turn is connected by a short peg with the mouth of what seems to be the head of a smaller alligator treated in like manner.

Length of specimen at lower right, 2.7 cm. top of this head is still another face, shorter and wider, without indication of teeth. The left foot of the alligator god is on top of this (Fig. 18 b). The fundamental subjects depicted on this antler occur throughout Costa Rican territory with certain stylistic differences. The serpent extending from or held to the mouth of a feline or human figure is found in stone in the three archaeological regions of this country: the At- lantic watershed and Highland, the Nicoya, and the Diquis (Fig. 19). It is seen in jade from the Atlantic watershed, and in gold in this re- gion and that of Diquis. This motif and anthro- pomorphic alligator gods, sometimes with a ser- pent coming from the mouth, form part of elab- orate, altar-grinding stones, offering tables, or other ceremonial objects in the Atlantic water- shed and Highland region. The alligator god likewise appears as an individual figure in stone in this area. There is one example in bone, in the National Museum of Costa Rica, from Nacascola, the Nicoya region (Fig. 20). The same concept is apparent, although the figures are by no means identical; and in spite of the position of the hands, the Nacascola figure lacks a serpent. The design of the headdress re- sembles the conventionalized snake pattern seen on bone objects from Jalaca (compare this motif with Figs. 15 c, 23, 24, 28 c-d). The feline or jaguar is common to all three archaeological areas. It is seen in stone, pottery, and, with the exception of Nicoya, occasionally in gold and resin. A number of pendants or staff butts were made from slightly curved antler tips with the base resembling a canine tooth (Figs. 21, 22, 23, 25 b). Some are in such a state of deterioration that only a portion of the base remains (Fig. 28 c). The design, however, is similar and is a conventionalization of a serpent. Bones carved in like patterns, and at times also resembling a canine tooth, have been found at Nacascola, Nicoya Peninsula (Fig. 34). The significance of these will be discussed later. Fig. 21 is less elaborate than Fig. 17, but it is clear that the same motif of the alligator god, with a crownlike headdress and a serpent, is portrayed. This time, however, the snake ex- tends from within the god's mouth, its head barely touching the top of the deity's hands, which meet on his chest. Slanting incised lines adorn the base. Fig. 22 b is perhaps the rep- resentation of a human head with hands clasped as if holding a serpent. The base, por- traying a canine tooth, was in pieces. FIG. 8. Shell beads.

Shell ornaments, most of which represent the frog. Largest specimen in bottom row, 2.5 cm. In Figs. 23 and 24, the smallest end is hol- lowed out and has three perforations through the sides. At the widest extremity stands a monkey carved in the round. A geometric pat- tern begins in fine lines at the perforated end and extends upward in coarser lines, covering the slightly curved and hanging tail, the but- tocks, and the thighs. It is possible that the de- sign represents the markings of a snake's skin or the hide of an alligator, as intertwining dia- mond motifs dominate. The monkey's head is inclined forward. The underpart of the chin, front of the neck, chest, and arms are cut free. Each lightly incised hand clutches the body of a snake, which comes out of the mouth of the monkey and goes down both sides to disappear at the beginning of the back. The ears, round eyes, flat nose, and mouth with teeth are executed in low relief and are very badly weathered. There is no decoration on the rest of the figure. Apart from its association with ceramic dec- oration, the monkey occurs in the Atlantic watershed in jadeite, gold, and resin, as well as being an important design element in stone. In the Diquis region, besides appearing as clay figurines belonging to Red and Black or Chiri- qui ware, it is seen in gold Chiriqui style and in FIG. 11. Animal teeth and bone fragments.

A number of broken antlers with a standing figure cut in the round at one end, but other- wise without decoration, were found at Jalaca. It is possible that these were unfinished, or it could be that these were part of ceremonial equipment representing a hierarchy of deities. We should remember that in 1960 the Tala- manca Indians of Costa Rica claimed that each clan and its individual members had a figure of bone or stone or gold which represented the clan protector (Stone 1962). Fig. 26 has a tip cut off bluntly, but the re- maining tip is carved in the round in high re- lief as a standing jaguar with his slightly curved tail hanging downward. Each front paw holds a vertical fish. The face is upturned, being carved on the very top of the antler. Although incised lines indicate fingers, there is only a flat manlike foot form with no attempt at toes. The treatment of the back with its flat torso, the squarely carved limbs, and the simplicity and boldness of execution recall stylistically certain Diquis stone figures. Other objects depict an upright jaguar with downward-pointing tail freed under the but- tocks, canine teeth indicated in the shape of an N, and the front paws turned upward on the chest (Fig. 25 a); a feline-like animal standing on his haunches holding with his hands what may be a serpent extending from his mouth (Fig. 27 a); and a similar figure with uplifted hands (Fig. 27 b).

Above this there is a crownlike portion hollowed in the center and with holes for suspension, similar to the more elaborate antler. All details are incised. The eyes and pupils are oval. The slightly curved bill is open in the center. On the back is a series of conventionalized patterns resembling scrolls or horizontal z-shapes, within rectangular frames and conforming to the shape of the bird's back. The last frame has a single scroll which gives the impression of a turned-up tail feather. The chest is undecorated and separated from the overlapping back by deep incisions which FIG. 18.

The feet and short legs are cut in high relief with jagged in- cisions for claws. A plain band of two incised lines serves as a base. Below this, the remainder of the antler is unworked. The "eagle" or "condor" motif, which we feel is generally a buzzard or king vulture in Central America, but might at times repre- sent the "Royal Eagle" famous in the mythology of the Talamancan tribes of Costa Rica today, is typical in archaeology (Stone 1952: 252; 1962. The Harpia harpyja [Linn.] lives in Talaman- ca). In pottery the most usual style is the modeled bird familiar to the art of Chiriqui and El Hatillo, Cocle culture area, Panama. Occa- sionally, however, a more naturalistic interpre- tation of a protruding head serving as a handle occurs in the Nicoya region and the Linea Vieja. This type is also associated with Nicaragua and is presumably of northern inspiration. There was one unidentifiable figure which, because it has four legs, we term an "animal." Its beak or snout, however, resembles that of a water fowl (Fig. 28 d). The only details are deeply incised lines to indicate the mouth, jaw, and the bare outline of the limbs and toes. The remaining part of the antler is decorated with an incised band similar to the pattern on the seal in Fig. 15 a. The design probably repre- sents a serpent. Human figures, with or without other motifs, appeared. Fig. 30 a is a male with erect penis and hands held upward to his breast. The head has disappeared. Fig. 30 b is a female with full upright breasts and hands held at the sides of an exaggerated navel. The only free space in connection with this image and Fig. 30 a is be- tween the legs. There is no indication of a mouth, but the eye rims are incised and almost circular. Ear lobes are a squared semicircle with an' indented, elongated dot. An incised line sur- rounds the flat head, while the hair hangs as one piece down the back without any attempt at individual locks. Nude male and female figures of stone, the latter with hands to the breast, are common in the Atlantic watershed, particularly Linea Vieja and the Reventazon areas. They are also occasionally found in clay in this region and un- doubtedly represented important deities. Other human figures on a canine-tooth- shaped base include Figs. 28 e and 31. Fig. 28 e, a human face with features in high re- lief, suggests an "alter-ego" motif, perhaps a FIG. 19. Feline representation with serpents, Diquis region. snake on a man.

The only indication which gives the impression of limbs is a free space from front to back between the head a-nd the antler. Fig. 31 is anthropomorphic. It is a pot-bellied male with arms at the chest, an erect penis, and a squared death's head for a face, with a serpent's body surrounding it, and a high head- dress which is similar to the portion above the crown on the various interpretations of the alli- gator god (Figs. 17 and 21-22) and the bird in Fig. 25 b. The difference lies in the perfor- ations which are rectangular instead of circu- lar. At the rear, what might be the tail of the anthropomorphic figure or part of the serpent blends into the reptile's face behind the death's FIG. 21. Figure carved on antler with base resembling head.

The armor is indicated by cross- hatching, with a band of incised, horizontal lines running through the center and an incised bor- der around the whole shell. The legs point down and the arms are lifted toward the mouth. Unfortunately the face is badly eroded and the paws are broken off. The same gesture seen in the first armadillo must have been represented here, however. These animals, seated with their paws to the mouth, and crosshatched shells are common in stone in the Diquis region, particularly at Palmar Sur. Standing represen- tations of this animal are plentiful in clay both FIG. 22. Bone figures. a, cylindrical seal; b, upper portion of base resembling a canine tooth. that section. All details are incised. The eyes are slant, and the face is adorned with either tattooed or painted designs. The erect penis, the aquiline nose with wide nostrils, and the ears are in low relief. The hair is carefully parted and combed. A circular perforation for a cord or thong passes between the neck and the hair. An object, perhaps a maraca, but broken at the top, is held in each hand. Clothing is represented by elaborate trousers and a wide girdle or band at the back. Fig. 33 is a squatting frog with emphasis on the head and front legs. The realistic style is similar to frog images in jadeite and in resin from the Linea Vieja, Atlantic watershed. The other pendants represent armadillos (Fig. 29 b, c). Both have a perforation through the center of the back to the front or stomach. The shell of one armadillo (Fig. 29 c) is stylized in rectangular form with no attempt at decora- tion. At the front of this shell, the figure itself is carved (Fig. 28 f). The doubled back legs, arms bent at the elbow, with the front paws at the mouth as if eating, and the forward- stretched head are in high relief. The raised ears, round eyes, and elongated nose have only the necessary form executed in low relief with- out incised lines. A circular perforation runs between the raised arms, head, and neck, and under the hands, freeing these elements. FIG. 23. Rear and left side view of monkey on base which resembles a canine tooth.

The roots of this religion appear to have been in the forest lands, presumably the Ama- zon and Orinoco basins, from whence it reached early Andean sites such as San Agustin in Colombia, Chavin in Peru, Tiahuanaco in Bolivia, and hence to the north, south, east, and west (Rivet 1925; Lothrop 1940). The funda- mental cult traits were often combined, for ex- ample, the feline and serpent, "eagle" and ser- pent or human or anthropomorphic figure with the serpent. This is clearly evident in Andean art, where the serpent extends from the feline mouth, is clutched in his paws, or forms a head- dress (for example, see Kroeber 1949: 417-20). Moving up from South America, these same cult traits appear in the isthmian region. The "eagle" with a serpent extending from or through the mouth is found in Veraguas (Loth- rop 1950, Figs. 110 e, 111) and is known in FIG. 26. Antler tip carved as standing jaguar holding fish. Length 8 cm. parallel conception or diffusion is responsible for these cult elements in Mesoamerica, the styl- istic relationship shows that the Mesoamerican counterparts should not be considered as be- longing to the cultural complex presented in this paper. The peg or pedestal base noted on many of the Jalaca figures, and the motif of a serpent head extending from the mouth of a figure or held to the mouth, are associated with early Andean sites, in particular San Agustin. This same motif frequently appears in lower Central America (Stone 1948). The concept of a serpent's head inside a deity's mouth with the tail visible is generally of northern or Mexi- can inspiration and is relatively rare in this re- gion. Likewise, the "N" portrayal of incisor teeth has been shown by Lothrop (1937: 170) to be common to the south and the lower isth- mian region. Even the totem-pole concept as demonstrated by the very elaborate antler sug- gests South American and Andean influence (Huerta Rend6n 1955: lam. VIII). A more detailed examination emphasizes these indications. The feline, serpent, "eagle" or "condor," and the personification of a deity FIG. 27.

In Cocle, Veraguas, and Chiriqui, _ Panama, there are occurrences of human or an- thropomorphic or animal figures with a serpent or conventionalized snake extending from or through the mouth (Lothrop 1937, I: Figs. 160 b, 161 a, 162 a-c, 163 a, 164). A related motif is present in stone in the Diquis region of Costa Rica, especially in the vicinity of Palmar Sur. Such an interpretation probably corresponds to that the alligator or crested-dragon motif is known in San Agustin and is common in Re- cuay, one of the early Peruvian sites, the Chic- ama valley, and Nasca, Peru. He further states that the Panamanian alligator concept, as seen in Chiriqui, is a connecting link between the South American interpretation and the plumed serpent-dragon complex of Middle and North. America (Lothrop 1926, II: 408-9). The monkey motif, like the serpent-alligator-dragon, FIG. 30. Human figures carved on antlers. a, headless spread from Peru northward. In Chiriqui, male; b female.

Beach, Cocl, and Veraguas, in Panama. The remaining cult elements at Jalaca, the mythical personages and the armadillo, seem more local in character. The nude personages seem limited to parts of Costa Rica, in particu- lar the Caribbean area; and as noted earlier, the clothed figure recalls the art of Chiriqui and probably depicts a god or culture hero familiar to that section. The seated armadillo is more characteristic of the Diquis region than any of the other symbols discussed above. Particularly in the flood plain of the Diquis or Rio Grande In spite of these local developments, this southeast region was obviously important as part of a route through which southern culture traits penetrated the Central American isthmus. The quantity of elaborate ritualistic artifacts at Jalaca, the majority with counterparts in the Andean and Amazonian areas, indicates the spread of these fundamental religious concep- tions. We are in accordance with the idea of three great artistic and cultural areas, which Willey (1962: 1-14) so ably suggests, and feel that southeastern Costa Rica lies within the sphere of San Agustin. It is touched to a lesser degree by the art and mythological concepts of Chavin and remains completely apart from that of La Venta or Mexican cultures. The further extension of these cult traits on the Pacific side beyond the southeastern area, is made evident by the appearance of shell frogs at Las Pozas de San Vicente on the eastern littoral of the Nicoya Peninsula, and of the alligator god in bone along with bones carved in serpent patterns at Nacas- cola (Fig. 34) on the northwestern coast of the Nicoya Peninsula. At the Nacascola site the elaborated bones were found with pottery resembling "Ulua Poly- chrome" (Stone 1957) and with an alabaster vessel of Ulua type associated with the Sula plain, Honduras (Stone 1932). This and the finding of similar cult motifs with Chiriqui or Red and Black ware at Jalaca place the Cen- tral American penetration of these cult con- cepts at about A.D. 1000 (Willey 1958: Fig. 4). The presence of Red and Black ware with these motifs extends the time horizon to the Spanish arrival. FIG. 32. 19th-century silver staff head from Peruvian highlands. Length 26.5 cm.
