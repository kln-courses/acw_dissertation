<plain_text><page sequence="1">On the Hegelian Sublime: Paul de Man's Judgment Call Martin Donougho In recent years, the sublime has become a focus of renewed interest in philosophy and literary theory, despite being (perhaps in part because it is) "the most confused and confusing notion of the time" (Honour 1977, 145).1 Much of the interest has been directed at the Kantian account and the long tradition stemming from it. By contrast, little attention has been paid to G. W. F. Hegel's version of the sublime, whether of the phenomenon itself or of its conceptualization. That is natural enough, it might be thought, given the marginal place accorded the sublime in Hegel's scheme of things - he simply was not interested. Yet, that very marginality is of interest, if we follow the lead of the subtlest of commentators, Paul de Man, in his essay "Hegel on the Sublime" (1983). As de Man reads and diagnoses it, Hegel's marginalizing of the sublime (much as with the section on symbolics or, indeed, aesthetics tout court) serves the interests of an aesthetic ideology. The gesture of putting the sublime aside in fact reveals more about the philosopher's system than is found in his express doctrine, de Man insists. The sublime, like Hegel's allegory, should then be read symptomatically, as the "defective cornerstone" of the entire system.2 In this essay, I have two aims: besides explicating Hegel's theory of the sublime on its own terms, I try to assess de Man's reading of Hegel's rhetorical strategies. Even if de Man's charges fail - as I argue they do - his approach to Hegel remains, I think, full of insights. The sublime, it might well be thought, betokens the same penetration of an objective field by subjective theory that (for Heidegger and others) is at issue with Western metaphysics as a whole; a prime instance of this would be Hegel's own allegedly mas- terful project, including his attempt at an aesthetic system. So understood, "on the sublime" would translate as over the sublime, that is, in a bid to enframe and control discourse about "the most high" or "great writing" (see Longinus).3 And then we might ask, for example, what Hegel is doing Philosophy and Rhetoric, Vol. 34, No. 1, 2001.

How exactly does he stage his discourse about art? Oddly enough, Hegel's sublime is not at all part of the main theoreti- cal line stemming (if only in retrospect) from Immanuel Kant. That line might be dubbed "the Romantic sublime" - the title of an influential book by Thomas Weiskel, which appeared posthumously in 1976 - or, alterna- tively, "the Yale sublime," in honor of an entire group (which includes Geoffrey Hartman and Harold Bloom) who wrote about the tendency of Romantics such as William Wordsworth and Ralph Waldo Emerson to in- vest themselves in their topic.4 Kant himself points to a possible illusory move he labels subreption. Here - to apply a useful distinction Peter de Bolla (1989) draws - we have not just a discourse on, but also a discourse of the sublime.5 The discourse of the sublime produces the very category it is meant to analyze, hence providing a space for "experience" of the sub- lime. A boot-strapping process induces a "subject-effect," calls forth a sub- ject position. The remarkable thing is that - although he is said at sixteen to have made a translation of Longinus6 and although he was, of course, familiar with the whole Kantian approach, which in many respects should have been congenial to him - Hegel stands apart from this "Romantic," or "hermeneutic," sublime. He does not at all give the appearance of staging readings in the manner sketched above, but instead adopts a distanced, dis- interested perspective on the phenomenon. Even so, his aesthetic system might be accused of framing a dis- course on the sublime, which, through seeking dialectical profit on its in- vestment, shades into a discourse of the sublime. Thus, de Man will argue that the philosophical trope by which Hegel banishes the sublime to the outer reaches of his system remains ideological. It is that, more insidious, secondary strategy I wish to assess. In section 1, 1 discuss Hegel's overall take on art, the classical Ideal, Romanticism, and the art of the sublime. Then, in section 2, 1 briefly take up his ordering of the sublime, as it appears in various lectures in the 1820s, before turning, in section 3, to Hegel's approach to the language of the sublime. Next, in section 4, 1 look at de Man on tropes and aesthetic theory in general; more particularly, in section 5, 1 look at his intricate reading of Hegel's Aesthetics. In this last section, I pose the question of whether de Man's own troping doesn't seek, in turn, to "overthrow" Hegel's.</page><page sequence="3">ON THE HEGELIAN SUBLIME 3 1. Hegel's eccentric turn Let me first sort out some preliminaries with regard to Hegel's general approach. These include (1) the relation he sees between beauty and the sublime; (2) his relation to the Romantic sublime, and to Romanticism gen- erally (for Hegel, romantic meant post-Hellenic, and he saw his own time as a decadent stage of that tradition); (3) his theorizing of the reflexivity of art - "art" as both category and institution; and (4) his reflexive attitude towards the classical Ideal. (1) It is almost commonplace to take Heidegger as the thinker of the sublime and Hegel as the philosopher of the beautiful.7 Thus, while it is true that Heidegger neither uses nor mentions the term, in his exemplary descriptions of some Greek temple or a Van Gogh painting the language does seem to invoke certain effects of sublime and desublimation alike. The artwork occurs in the gap that opens between earth and the determi- nate world it inaugurates, a gap never entirely closed. At the same time, Heidegger marshals this language in order to (try and) d/splace representa- tion, to ^center a stable subject via the experience of a certain transport, which runs counter to the sublime insofar as that "phenomenon" (e.g., in the Kantian formulation) implicates transcendental subjectivity. In sum, Heidegger absorbs the beautiful into a sublime that nevertheless resists a Romantic/Kantian closure. Conversely, Hegel could be said to absorb the sublime into the beau- tiful and to retain the sublime only as ancillary to the Ideal. Indeed, putting it that way helps to explain its marginal place: for Hegel, the beauty of ancient Greece joins in fact what Kant had put asunder in theory, namely, the poles of beauteous harmony and ethical (hence, sublime) disparity. Dieter Henrich makes an important point in noting Hegel's choice of a Schillerian word, Ideal, to designate an objective synthesis of beauty and the sublime (1957, esp. 546f.). Yet, that only highlights Hegel's subordina- tion of the sublime proper as mere figure of speech. The paradox is well put by de Man: "The sublime for Hegel is the absolutely beautiful [sc. the Greek Ideal]. Yet nothing seems less sublime, in our current use of the term, than the sublime in Hegel" (1983, 144). Hegel has nothing to say about the natural sublime, which had so impressed those of the previous period; instead, his category marks almost a return to the rhetorical, or "Longinian" tradition. Just as surprisingly, (2) Hegel invests his discussion with little of the plangency accreted to the sublime during the Romantic era, whether in poetic practice or in Kantian</page><page sequence="4">4 MARTIN DONOUGHO theory - the egotistical or "hermeneutic" sublime. It is possible to invest Hegel's own discussion with a Romantic charge, as Weiskel does so bril- liantly; however, it is equally important to note that Hegel chose not to do so. Instead, he kept the sublime at a historical distance, tucked away some- where between ancient Egypt and Greece, if indeed it is to be placed any- where - for whether as biblical or as Christian poetry, it threatens to escape geographical or historical docketing altogether. For his part, de Man resisted the modern tendency to proffer a Ro- mantic interpretation of Romanticism - Northrop Frye, Bloom, Hartman, and Weiskel being typical in this regard (de Man 1972; Gearhart 1989). De Man noted that Hegel at least progressed beyond that approach in seeking a dialectical account of history, one in which sons are ranged against fa- thers, the only stable element being the dynastic struggle itself. Yet, even this presumed too much, in de Man's book; he opted, instead, for a symp- tomatic reading of the rhetoric of Romanticism, in its figurative and tropological disguises. It is certainly true that Hegel criticized the Roman- tics, especially their pretense to be able to close the circle of self-reflection so as to ground their own constitutive activity. In that sense, he put them in their place, and into history. At the same time, he owed the Romantics (the Schlegels, Schelling in 1800, Novalis, et al.) the speculative insight into art's reflexive status. Art, we might say, did not exist as art before the Romantics, and in a dual sense. In the first place, the aesthetic of original- ity or expressivity raised the fine arts into a singular Art (with a capital Λ) considered an end-in-itself . In their study of Romantic ideology, The Liter- ary Absolute (1988), Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe and Jean-Luc Nancy label it an aesthetic of "forming form." (3) This is not the place to discuss whether a Romantic expressivism is a viable theory, or how far Hegel is indebted to it. Let me just remark that a less tendentious account would stress the formal process of self- reflection or autopoiesis (Niklas Luhmann's term [1990],8 borrowed from systems theory): just as with literature and other social systems around the same time, art defines itself as a product of its own operations. Escaping hierarchical relations, goals, or values, art defines itself "functionally," with respect to what it is not. More paradoxically, art can be distinguished only ab extra. As Luhmann wittily puts it, "We can know reality only because we are excluded from it - as from paradise" (1990). Hegel has a foot in both camps - the Romantic aesthetic of forming form, on the one hand, and a formalist self-reflexivity, on the other. He allows a certain positive value to the newly emergent (or, perhaps, created) norm of "creativity"</page><page sequence="5">ON THE HEGELIAN SUBLIME 5 while also critiquing it, distinguishing it as a self-reflexive and ultimately hollow social practice. (4) There is a paradox here, one Hegel is alert to and, indeed, plays with. Art is art only from the outside, as a shape of life grown old. The living tree is dead (he observes in the Phenomenology); later generations can but pick its fruit, to enjoy and display as they like. Georg Lukâcs phrases the paradox with respect to action, Handlung: the epic world-condition can be viewed only in a dramatic perspective, for epic can make no formal distinctions (1971, 41, 46). The self-conscious regard cast by the Roman- tics (and proto-Romantics such as Johann Gottfried Herder) upon the past uncovered the classical norm, as well as the pre-classical (or "symbolic" in Hegel's terms) and the "romantic" (Christian or post-Hellenic) norms. Hence, Hegel is not to be seen, except ironically, as a (neo-)classicist. The Ideal is something past. As a norm, it is "always already" past (one is re- minded of Friedrich Schlegel's 1798 aphorism that if the golden age is past, it is not golden [1991, #243]). The artistically beautiful is in its very essence what must fall - must have fallen, have come to a tragic end. The putative unity of beautiful and sublime moments unravels; the sublime limits to the Ideal - which nevertheless define and distinguish it - emerge into the light of day. (For that reason, it is perverse of Lacoue-Labarthe to as- sail Hegel's subordination of the sublime to the beautiful, let alone to sniff at Hegel's "jubilation" over the anthropomorphic solution to the "riddle" posed by the symbolic world view; reconciliation in the Ideal is not HegeVs reconciliation, however much he admired it, nor is it his humanist norm.9) Further, while Hegel was at pains to present the essential ideality of art,10 arguing strenuously in the late 1820s against the empiricism, even sensual- ism, of his contemporary Carl Friedrich von Rumohr, art represented for him a displaced value. Of course, from a dialectical standpoint, value is by definition displaced. Value is of value only if it is not perceived as a rela- tive value, in the same way that tradition must be tacit, naturalized, rather than willed, if it is to be inhabited. Art - that is, the presentation of beauty, of the classical Ideal - is a differential value in the Hegelian system.11 Hence the paradox by which we may rightly claim that for Hegel the beautiful is "always already" sublime. It plays against its own limits. In what follows, I take up some implications of this paradox.</page><page sequence="6">6 MARTIN DONOUGHO 2. The status of the sublime within Hegel's system As observed, the sublime infuses Hegel's classical Ideal, a precarious unity in opposition. The sublime emerges as the tragic fate of the beautiful - and, in essence, sculptural - Ideal. (That it is the victory of a verbal over an iconic medium emerges more clearly in the account of Greek Kunst- religion in the Phenomenology than in the presentation of the Aesthetics.) I want to argue, nevertheless, that the sublime is more important than its ancillary place suggests, not because it shows up the limits to Hegel's specu- lative recuperation of art, but insofar as its native idiom of finitude and boundedness informs the dialectic itself. Let me briefly look at how Hegel (or the dialectic) frames the sublime, once it has been shorn of Kant's for- malism and subjectivity. Hegel's ordering of the discourse of the sublime varies considerably during the Berlin period. His first lectures on aesthetics (winter 1820/21) might seem to omit the category altogether: Hegel moves directly from the second stage of the symbolic ("the true symbolic" of Egyptian religious imagery) to a third stage comprising the split between meaning and ex- pression (particularized as fable, allegory, etc.).12 Yet, in fact, when Hegel takes up the classical form of art (which he calls "the absolutely signifi- cant"), he divides it into two stages. The first, "The Classical Sublime," includes pantheism and what he calls the "Arabian" world view, shared also by the Jews; the second is "Classical Beauty" proper (1995, 139-45, 145-60). (In this duality, we might detect the influence of Johann Joachim Winckelmann, with his partition of the Greek Ideal into "high" and "beau- tiful" styles; the first does not necessarily rank below the second.) Subse- quently, the articulation was taken further. In the slightly later 1821 lectures on philosophy of religion, Hegel referred to the Eastern or Jewish "reli- gion of sublimity," preceding (and offset by) a Greek religion of beauty. In such a religion, divine essence is figured as a negative power, Lord over all appearance or external show of the world, which is at once posited and negated by the one God (1984-87, 2: 122ff.):13 "Sublimity is the idea that expresses or manifests itself, but in such a way that in thus appearing in or upon reality it at the same time shows itself as sublime, exalted (erhaben) above this appearing and the reality, so that reality is simultaneously pos- ited as negated. ... In an appearance [of the sublime god,] negatedness - the power over this shape (Gestalt) - must therefore be posited simul- taneously" (2: 432-33; trans, amended).14 This logic of divine essence and its reflected appearance provides the religious context and content for sub-</page><page sequence="7">ON THE HEGELIAN SUBLIME 7 sequent discussions of the aesthetics of the sublime. At issue is whether and how external show can be said or seen to be essential to essence, or, rather, how aesthetic shape can reflexively posit its own nullity, and what that would entail for the systematic conception of art. Thus, the 1823 lectures on the philosophy of art approach the sub- lime, not under the rubric of a classical "severe" style, but as chapter 2 of the symbolic art form, between the symbolic as such (Zoroastrian mythol- ogy, Indian fantasy, Egyptian imagery and architecture) and what he calls "simile" or "comparison" {das Gleichnis) - fable, allegory, as before (1998, 140-42). Hegel briefly considers the "sacred poetry" of the Jews, that is, verbal expression of essence, which presumes a scission {Trennung) in the unity of meaning and shape, yet a scission that psalmic form can celebrate; words both hide the Lord of all and reveal his infinite power. In the 1826 series on aesthetics, this arrangement is amended: the sublime appears within the fourth form (or mode) of symbolic art, following (1) the dis- course of light (e.g., Zoroastrianism), (2) Indian Phantasie, and (3) "the symbol proper" (Hegel 1998, 72)15 of Egyptian artworks and their cult of death. The final mode proceeds from a Jewish sublime - everything sensu- ous is null - through a kind of pantheism of thought as it permeates all singular beings,16 to a final split between meaning and figuration (in de- vices such as fable, riddle, and the various imagery collected in the Hotho edition under "conscious symbolics"). Surprisingly, the 1828/29 arrange- ment places the Egyptian cult of the dead after the sublime. Hegel calls it "symbolism in its highest form" because of its stress on the inward and spiritual for its own sake. The sublime is here articulated into Persian pan- theism and "the Jewish representation of God" (1998, 83-84). Again, sur- prisingly, he has more to say about the former, perhaps because of its contemporary resonances with symbolism in poetry (Goethe, for example). Hotho's official edition returns to the 1823 tripartite structure, where the second chapter encompasses the sublime, dividing it into two (as in 1826) while placing the negative sublime (e.g., biblical poetry) after the positive (e.g., Persian poetry), as in 1828/29. One last oddity should be mentioned (though it has more to do with Hegel's conception of religion than with his aesthetics). In the 1827 series on philosophy of religion, Hegel places religion of the sublime after the Greek religion of beauty, as if to emphasize God the creator rather than a plurality of divine artificers: the criterion here is "free subjectivity," and Jahweh prefigures the Christian divinity (1984-87, 2: 669f.).17 With re- spect to religious content, then, the sublime comes off higher in the scale</page><page sequence="8">8 MARTIN DONOUGHO than a potentially idolatrous beauty. The irony is that the aesthetic form of sublimity effaces itself before its content; that is, it negates itself in its own right - as may be seen when we turn to the Aesthetics proper. 3. Hegel on sublime language In the Aesthetics, Hegel cites Kant's theory in §23 of the Critique of Judg- ment and approves Kant's locating of the sublime in us, rather than in na- ture proper (1970, 13: 467-78; 1975, 1: 362-63). But he deviates from what he sees as Kant's subjectivism and formalism, preferring to empha- size the determinate content in the sublime, as articulated in religious and cultic consciousness.18 This section of the Aesthetics, and the correspond- ing one in the Philosophy of Religion, treat a religious content or meaning, namely, "the one God," Lord of all, which lacks any graven or other im- ages - the Judaeo-Christian deity and its trappings. (Again, this is not, pace Lacoue-Labarthe's willful misreading, a "dialectical" comprehension of the sublime, whatever that might amount to, but more a cultural observa- tion.19) From the perspective of aesthetics, however, more important than religious content is another element: the essentially linguistic medium in which it is "presented" {dargestellt not vorgestellt). Hegel stresses the point that, since the image or shape is no longer adequate to express meaning, the poetic word is its appropriate vehicle (13: 480; 1: 373). It symbolizes an abstract power over imagery and iconic signification. This verbal - we might well say, performative - emphasis has two moments. The word instantiates God's power in the external realm of hu- man comprehension. As Hegel puts it, when we read "'God said' - the text tells us how He works. Outwardly displayed, in an image, His working is speech" (1984-87, 2: 433).20 But, in turn, although this is not stressed by Hegel, it is humans who constitute the addressees of this sublime speech. In the biblical text that we read, these addressees refer to - that is, they quote or mimic - God's speech, thus setting out on the self-reflexive path mentioned at the outset. That too harks back to Longinus, or the tradition of commentary upon his work; consider, for example, Gibbon's "I almost doubt which is most sublime, Homer's Battle of the Gods or Longinus' apostrophe to Terentianus upon it" (1929, 155-56) - words on words, with no terminus ad rem in sight. Reflexivity has its hermeneutic or Romantic side, of course, since the reader, too - Hegel, or you and I - is implicated</page><page sequence="9">ON THE HEGELIAN SUBLIME 9 in and reproduces, even produces, the dynamics of the sublime. At a safe distance, one could call this a discourse of as well as on, the sublime, that is, a discourse that elicits the very effects it is supposed to be analyzing, as if language itself excites the imagination to such feelings. Or again, it could be seen as an act of enunciation, one calling for imaginative identifications between the various figures of poet, text, and reader/beholder.21 Yet our (that is, Hegel's) naming or seeing discourse as such, as a speech act, also places it in quarantine, limits its effect on us as readers of the biblical text. Whatever his reasons, Hegel does keep the sublime at arm's length, framing the discourse of/on the sublime as religious imagery and rhetoric. He does not himself enter into the mental fight the discourse reenacts, but rather talks neutrally about the language as such. That is a crucial point; for it is all too easy to assume that Hegel puts himself (and so his listeners or readers) into the phenomenal experience he describes.22 Should we in- terpret his words (as reported by the student audience) to be the philo- sophical reenactment of the Longinian sublime, or as seeking to encapsulate it, and so neutralize its effects? De Man can be read both ways, that is, as accusing Hegel's language of rendering the sublime self-sublating23 or as absolving Hegel of Longinian-Romantic excesses, which he criticizes - only to take him as indulging in such excess at a reflexive remove. The second, I think more interesting, interpretation allows that Hegel escapes from a "specular" ideology, something we can "see through," but accuses him nevertheless of falling into a purely "linguistic" ideology, language pretending to be and do other than it is and does.24 But before taking up de Man's charges, I shall run through Hegel's account. Hegel offers several biblical examples of the language of the sub- lime. The first section ("God as Creator and Lord of the World") shows language seeking to express the oneness of God as Lord of all, that is, not in a natural relation of procreation, but in the spiritual act of creation. Hegel cites a text (as he notes) already to be found in Longinus: "God said: Let there be light; and there was light" (1970, 13: 481; 1975, 1: 373).25 The effect of sublimity in this instance comes from the performative power imputed to God's mere uttering of the words, which suffices (it is said) to create from nothing, to turn on the light, as it were. Here the language (but not necessarily Hegel, we should add) speaks from a "God's eye-view," von Seiten Gottes her (13: 481; 1: 374). In contrast to that discourse of divine creation, we have the language of finitude, whether (Hegel's second division) lamenting an entgöttert finite world, wholly "prosaic" in its fix- ity, though rediscovering the variety of nature, or (his third, "the human</page><page sequence="10">10 MARTIN DONOUGHO individual") reflecting on the nullity of the natural world in praise of God alone - yet it is the individual person who holds in his mind the two mo- ments of creator and his create.26 In this last division of the sublime, Hegel speaks of humans miserably bereft of God and then of the feeling of sinful- ness and wickedness attendant on such a finite, merely natural state.27 He goes on, however, to note that even within this "Nichtigkeit" the human individual attains a "freer and more independent status {Stellung)" and in two ways. On the one hand, the individual finds a certain security in sub- mission to the Law (das Gesetz - God's law). On the other hand, in the scission (Unterscheidung) of man from God and finite from Absolute, re- sponsibility, both for critical judgment (Urteil: cutting or krinein) as to what is good or evil and for the actual decision (Entscheidung) for one over the other, lies with the subject. Hence, the subject may come to link its condition with having obeyed or disobeyed the law and accept worldly "reward" or "punishment," respectively. For this third division of sublime language, the Psalms prove exem- plary. They express the nullity of our finite existence and mode of portray- ing God and speak from a human, fallen point of view. Hegel quotes Psalm 104: "[Thou] Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment; who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain" (1970, 13: 484; 1975, 1: 375).28 Hegel comments that light and other natural phenomena are nothing in them- selves, but merely serve divine purpose. Furthermore, God's creatures are at his mercy; the psalm continues, "[T]hou hidest thy face, they are troubled." Such language amounts to the denial of all personal dignity and positive existence: Lord, I am nothing compared with thy might. There operates what Weiskel terms a "logic of desublimation," rather than the "egotistical sublime" characteristic of much Romantic discourse. Return- ing to "my sole self (to cite John Keats), I find that "the fancy cannot cheat so well /As she is fam'd to do, deceiving elf (1982, 281, 11. 72-74). And yet, Kant's dynamic sublime enters here, too, for the self recovers even in dejection (not yet disjection). In short, where the quotation from Genesis indicates a celebration of the power of speech (supposing it is God who speaks to us), the text from Psalms bemoans the failure of language to pass beyond the boundary of the self's fallen condition. Yet, in so doing, it points per negationem to God's infinite power; it presents the unpresentable, or rather (as Jean-François Lyotard has it) that it exceeds presentation.29</page><page sequence="11">ON THE HEGELIAN SUBLIME 1 1 4. Paul de Man's tropology De Man's criticism of Hegel's rhetorical moves in these sections is of a piece with his powerful deconstructive critique of "the Romantic sublime" as a version of "aesthetic ideology," namely, the "confusion of linguistic with natural reality" (1986, II).30 The attack takes aim at the theatrical or mimetic model that - with progressively broadening irony - Kant, Weiskel, and Hertz adopt. It is equally a critique of de Man's own earlier self. De Man had shifted from a phenomenological emphasis on temporal experi- ence and its limits, first to a "rhetoric of temporality" (irony and allegory conceived as articulations of a divided self), and then to a wholesale troping of the self as no more than a figure of speech, a textual invention. In that last period, de Man turned to and against the aesthetic formalism - the mi- metic prosopopoeia - of Kant, Schiller, and Hegel, whose texts he "read" in a layered, complex way (which I can no more than suggest). Briefly, (1) he sought to lay bare their linguistic (or "theoretical") structures, as re- vealed in a "break" in register or voice. Representation or figure is shown to have a conventional, unmotivated basis, not simply in a deep, structural- ist "grammar" (e.g., Michael Riffaterre, Algirdas Greimas), but as the work- ings of an inhuman textual machine. Complementing such syntactics, there comes (2) the pragmatics of imposition or positing (Setzung) or "inscrip- tion" of meaning - a violent yoking of words with world. It is primarily here that tropes enter and get to work. De Man explores the punctual, ran- dom, inhuman repetition of language in Kant's and Hegel's discussions of "power." However, (3) this thetic and willful act is elided in the text, which figures it into semantic continuity once more, thus allowing us to interpret and so humanize its meaning, or, rather, to give it meaning in the first place. The linguistic and tropological constitution of representation gets covered over by representation once more; that secondary move is what makes it ideological. De Man will examine such "naturalizing" of figure in Kant's example of the poet's "Augenschein" which produces a non- sheltering sky, or in Hegel's citation of divine speech acts. The ideological process of imposition/naturalization goes, as it were, by itself, of its own accord. We poor humans cannot arrest the circular reading process. "No degree of knowledge can ever stop this madness," he declares in his 1979 essay "Shelley Disfigured," "for it is the madness of words" (1984, 122).31 I should add that this is not the end of de Man's story or, indeed, of the madness he diagnoses. It might be thought that the deconstructive ma-</page><page sequence="12">1 2 MARTIN DONOUGHO neuver is complete, and the critic has diagnosed the epistemological fail- ure or error hardwired into poetic language. But, in fact, the critical act of reading cannot remain as aloof as it would like: it has finally (4) to confess its own complicity here, to make its excuses. It is as if even de Man cannot escape the aesthetic ideology he proscribes - and admits as much. The critic itself becomes the machina ex machina. (We should bear this self-implica- tion in mind below, in view of his ultimate verdict on Hegelian ressent- iment.) 5. De Man on Hegel's sublime De Man comments, first, on Hegel's citations in the first and third divi- sions of the sublime and, second, on his dialectic, as unfolded toward the end of the third division. Let me take up each in turn. First, de Man sees in Hegel's two sorts of example - from Genesis and from the Psalms - a deceptive shifting between a representational (es- pecially mimetic) and a tropological approach to language. Hegel's "aes- thetic ideology" is here understood less as figurai misrepresentation - which the critic can just "see through" - than as tropological elision - that is to say, deception at the level of performative self-presentation. Thus, the first text quotes or mimes representational language about light and so on to suggest - if hardly establish - the performative power of divine language; a language that posits existence does not merely generate it in what would seem a "natural" fashion. God says and it is done (so the text says). De Man draws our attention to the difference in performative power between (divine) positing and (human) quotation or mimesis of that act, noting that Hegel here speaks "von Seiten Gottes her"' from God's perspective, as if we could have access to it (1983, 147). De Man then remarks that even though we humans cannot duplicate God's linguistic power, we can talk about it without contradiction and represent "light" as that which God cre- ates: representation is all it claims to be. By contrast to the first text, he observes, the second speaks "von Seiten des Menschen" and, further, while using such representations as "garment" and "curtain," it is primarily an address or apostrophe to the presumed God: a trope, in short, though a minor one. "Unlike the logos" he comments, our alluding to God's robe "does not have the power to posit anything; its power, or only discourse, is the knowledge of its weakness" (148). Human praise of God - or at least</page><page sequence="13">ON THE HEGELIAN SUBLIME 1 3 of what is presumed to be the appearance of divinity - is of a different order from God's verbal positing. Yet (de Man holds), their "juxtaposi- tion" implicitly identifies them, in the assumption that divine light simply is the light we see, or that it really is God inside the garment of light. The collocation of the two quotations - of figurai representation, namely, the light, stand-in for God, which shines on humanity, and of trope, namely, our recognition that we are powerless - empowers a spirit that "posits it- self as that which is unable to posit." The result is either self-contradictory or disingenuous. "One can pretend to be weak when one is strong, but the power to pretend is decisive proof of one's strength," de Man pronounces (148).32 It seems therefore that the self can never simply posit that it cannot posit - that is, come clean about its figurai contrivances - but must always play the eiron, pretending to be less powerful than it is. A mininarrative or staging is implied, which would go something like this: while the self - the poetic persona anyway - can use figures to refer to the impotence of lan- guage ("deceiving elf," as Keats says), it still recovers its presence of mind, if only in mimed and represented dejection. It pretends to be other than the divine, yet at the same time tacitly claims the mantle of divinity for its own poetic activity. The purely linguistic trope of praise/dejection combines with the mimetic representation of divine light - and it is the combination that makes for the ideological move de Man censures. This certainly would locate Hegel squarely in the camp of the Ro- mantic sublime, eliciting the effects it also thematizes. Nonetheless, it has to be asked whether it is Hegel speaking and quoting, or rather the dis- course of the sublime he is in turn mentioning or discussing (but not mim- ing), as a determinate practice strictly "for us." Is his instancing of the sublime itself sublime? I think not, in Hegel's distanced glance. And we readers or listeners are called on to recognize, but not endorse, the working of the sublime. Again, as de Man considers the "juxtaposition" of the two quotations, it is worth asking whose act of collocation it is - Hegel's or de Man's - especially in view of the page or two of text that separates them. In sum, de Man's first criticism - Hegel elides aesthetic representation and rhetorical trope - is unfounded. De Man concludes that, "[w]hen language functions as trope, and no longer as representation, the limits of the Longinian sublime as well as of its considerable powers of recuperation, including the power of self ironization, are reached" (1983, 149).33 Insofar as Hegel has shifted from representation to trope with his second example, he cannot (even ironi- cally) rescue the sublime for aesthetics once more. The suggestion is that</page><page sequence="14">14 MARTIN DONOUGHO Hegel does nevertheless try to do so, whether by pretending to speak for God or more subtly by supposing that philosophical aesthetics can find a place from which to compare divine and human perspectives ("the very idea!" as Donald Davidson might exclaim). There is no reason to suppose that Hegel attempts either move. He merely reports on biblical speech and notes the characteristic ways it works. I suggest that Hegel puts the dis- course of the sublime in brackets; he does not himself seek to capitalize on its pathos. In any event, de Man goes to some lengths to assert (I think rightly) that Hegel, or as he puts it, Hegel's language, disallows this last-ditch ironic recuperation. I would claim that de Man is right to diagnose in Hegel's example a stripping away of the last layer of figurative speech, and to see it as a transition to the following chapter of the Aesthetics, on rhetorical devices or "symbolics." It should be noted that, in Hegel's Encyclopedia, too, example and transition mark the end of aesthetic (iconic) Phantasie and the beginning of Hegelian Gedächtnis, thoughtful commemoration. We arrive finally at a hollowed out subjectivity, its total "utterance," alien- ation, and consignment to repetition - though it is true that for Hegel thought then rises again on the ruins of language. In the Aesthetics, it is thought and the subject that become lord of figures of speech, and with that, I go to de Man's more comprehensive attack on Hegel's own rhetoric. Second, the question at this point is whether there is after all a recu- perative economy at work in the dialectic winding up the chapter on the sublime, albeit not in Pascalian/Longinian/Kantian mode. Can the com- plete nullity of selfhood - the point we have now arrived at - still be made to return a profit, as in Weiskel's "logic of desublimation"? De Man claims that Hegel's aesthetic ideology ensures that it must do so. Is he right? The context here is the end of the third division in Hegel's discus- sion, where he takes up the language of human finitude, bereft of God, and yet the feeling of sinfulness in such a state. De Man labels this a "criticar economy (rather than one of value or "position"): in it, the sheer power of linguistic positing {Setzen: "And God said . . .") is undone by the authority of criticism, that is, of critical judgment. De Man thinks this undoing is performed in the name of the nameless, the ordinary, the slave in chains of language. And it is a political act, he says, not because it founds a new order in any way, but because it upsets a (supposedly) illicit authority, whether religious, monarchical, or linguistic. Moreover, this is the re- venge - or better, ressentiment - of the slave and his prosaic morality, as witness the following section's reduction of poetic figure to prosaic Setzen,</page><page sequence="15">ON THE HEGELIAN SUBLIME 1 5 and Hegel's comment (apropos the fable) that "[p]rose begins with the slave" (1970, 13: 497; 1975, 1: 387).34The apothegm is, of course, a variant of the Master/Slave dialectic from the Phenomenology, which reappears in the beautiful soul's valet mentality - "For the valet there are no heroes." Hegel's prosaic mentality is said to "discover" a world of prose just because - a familiar Hegelian reversal, now applied to Hegel himself - it had already been installed there. This would amount to a supreme irony, pretending to come upon a self which had in fact always been prefigured in that place: an ultimate forgetting of one's own self-positing in order to reap the rewards of continually reducing the world to prosaic selfhood. It is thus the victory of trope over representation, of prose over poetic genre, says de Man - and perhaps, too, of philosophy over the art world it observes. Is de Man correct here? Does Hegel's ressentiment work to reduce poetry to his own menial level? It is indeed "the prose of the world" that art and figurai thinking have been reduced to. But it is not necessarily by the reflexive power of critical ressentiment, I would argue. For one thing, on general grounds, it is precisely the right to critique that Hegel questions in Kant's critical philosophy (and, by extension, in "conscience" - Gewissen - and "the beautiful soul," both of them stand-ins for the Kantian Weltanschauung). Who is to judge the judging consciousness? Hegel asks. In world-historical perspective, the individual living under the cultural dis- pensation of the sublime remains irredeemably finite; its position is that of "external reflection." Immortality, forgiveness, and redemption are not even at issue in such desublimated, secular times. The measure of the unhappi- ness of such a "Hapless Consciousness" is that it does not even know it is unhappy - precisely the fate of Roman culture, in Hegel's view. And we should note that in the fuller account of sublime culture or cult given in the Philosophy of Religion, Hegel adduces two exemplars. The first is Job, displaying a patient acceptance of God's law and whatever is meted out by fate (1984-87, 2: 140, 448).35 The second is the stoic, who accepts what- ever befalls him as part of the order of things, and indeed seeks virtue in it, indifferent to his own finitude, putatively free and autonomous, if only in the abstract (2: 153-54, 443). Whereas Hegel might elsewhere like to see through such figures (as in the dialectic of Stoic consciousness from the Phenomenology), here at least there simply is no transcending their bounds. The philosophical observer passes no judgment on their finitude. In sum, Hegel's sublime just is irredeemably finite and prosaic, with no dialectical recourse. The language of sublimity stands for the total di- vorce of sacred from profane; through the vanishing of the sacred, the sub-</page><page sequence="16">1 6 MARTIN DONOUGHO lime comprises language with no intrinsic meaning. (I count it as one of de Man's keenest insights that he remained obsessed with this total separation of language and meaning, which Hegel identifies here, linking Hegel with Walter Benjamin on that account.36) This desublimated sublime bears a strict similarity to the way mechanical memory (Gedächtnis) depends, in the Encyclopaedia, upon the way figure reduces to abstraction (Hegel 1978, 3: §§463-64). More to the point for my argument, the art that comes "after" Jewish sublime is condemned to the same fate and the same finitude, re- ducing to realism, on the one hand, Romantic "humor," on the other. Whether as the Greek Ideal or as romantic (and ultimately Romantic) su- pernaturalism, art will reduce to the prose of the world. Hegel's 1827 place- ment of the sublime after Greek Kunstreligion, as part of the emergent Christian world view, is no aberration. The beautiful Ideal proves fleeting and finite, bounded before and after by the sublime. The sublime, in short, is less the defective than the defining cornerstone of Hegel's reflections on art. In the Aesthetics, Hegel discusses the figure of the epigram, not merely under "Symbolics" (mere figure), but also in its historical role as marking the transition between art forms/world views. It marks, in short, the mo- ment in which subjectivity is inscribed upon an external world (1970, 14: 239-41; 1975, 1: 608-10; see also Donougho 1982).37 In that sense, the sublime inscribes a meta-aesthetic epigram upon Hegel's theoretical musings on art. On its blank surface, we may read a commemoration of the beautiful Ideal. Yet, that commemorative act puts a retrospectively consti- tuted "Art," not merely in a mausoleum, but equally in the civic and na- tional museum (or concert hall). The prose of the (modern) world is what museum art both shuns and must live with. Hegel's own judgment call on the sublime is accordingly ambivalent, fully aware of its own enactment, neither indulging in its power nor submitting to its law. Department of Philosophy University of South Carolina Notes 1. He is speaking of the neoclassical era, but it might equally be said of other periods. 2. De Man applies this last epithet to Hegelian symbolics in "Sign and Symbol in Hegel's Aesthetics" (1982, 775): "Allegory functions, categorically and logically, like the defective cornerstone of the entire system." De Man clearly thinks that Hegel's sublime is momentous in a similar way. 3. Another version is the feminist defense of the small-scale rhetoric and critique of gigantist rhetoric (e.g., Schor 1987; Freeman 1995).</page><page sequence="17">ON THE HEGELIAN SUBLIME 17 4. Weiskel also calls it the "hermeneutic" sublime, since it has to do with poetic self- understanding. I write about the entire trend and its continuation via de Man and his dis- ciples in an unpublished essay entitled "Stages of the Sublime in North America," forthcom- ing in MLN (December 2000). 5. For Kant's distinction, see Critique of Judgment (§27: Akademie ed. p. 257; 1987, p. 114, trans, amended): "[T]he feeling of the sublime in nature is respect for our calling (Bestimmung), which by a certain subreption we attribute to an object of nature (putting respect for the object in place of respect for the idea of humanity within our own subject)." Further references in the text are to these editions. 6. The editors of the Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion cite Karl Rosenkranz (1984- 87, 2: 433n). 7. See, e.g., McCumber (1989, 313-14) and Shapiro (1985, esp. 213f., 223f.), noting Hegel's fusion of the two. Lacoue-Labarthe (1993) might seem to agree, yet he argues that Heidegger operates too much under the aegis of Hegel, and hence remains indebted to a systemic subordination of the sublime to the beautiful, the sublime as an incomplete beauti- ful. 8. Luhmann credits the biologist Humberto Maturana with the term. See also Schmidt (1989, chap. 1, "Von literarische Diskursen zum Sozialsystem"). 9. "The sublime truth" (Lacoue-Labarthe 1983, 91-92). The reference is to the inscrip- tion above the temple to Isis, noted by Kant as well as by many of the Romantics. Hegel interprets it as inaugurating the Apollonian regime of Greek culture. 10. He could not prove it: the Idea must be assumed lemmatically, so to say (Hegel 1970, 13: 42; 1975, 1: 24). Further references are to these editions. 11. I take up some of the paradoxes in "Hegel's Historicism" in The Encyclopaedia of Aesthetics (1998). 12. See Hegel's Vorlesung über Ästhetik: Berlin 1820/21; eine Nachschrift (1995). On the various Berlin arrangements, see Jeong-Im Kwon's "Die Metamorphosen der 'symbolischen Kunstform'" (Hegel 1992, 41-89, esp. 60). 13. For the complex mutations in Hegel's logical and historical grasp of religion during the Berlin period, see Jaeschke (1990, 200f., 275f.). Jaeschke notes that Hegel operates with four elements: imagery of light, notions of divine power, lack of shape, and purpose. 14. Cf. Vorlesungen über die Philosophie der Weltgeschichte (1968, 2: 454): the relation of God and nature is what renders God sublime. 15. Following the clear division of an anonymous ms. in Aachen; the Griesheim ms., chief source for 1 826, is not as clear. 16. The Aachen ms. calls the first the "classical sublime" - compare the Ascheberg tran- script - and the second "new oriental pantheism." 17. See Yovel (1978, 173-74). Yovels complaint - that Hegel sacrifices Jewish religion on the altar of logical system - is answered by Jaeschke (1990, 276), who notes that in 1831 Hegel applies another standard, replacing adequate shape by mediation between finite and infinite: Judaism becomes part of the transition to the partial integration of subjectivities found in classical Greece. 18. "This outward shaping which is itself annihilated in turn by what it reveals, so that the revelation of the content is at the same time a sublation of the revelation, is the sublime. This, therefore, differing from Kant, we need not place in the pure subjectivity of the mind and its Ideas of Reason; on the contrary, we must grasp it as grounded in the one absolute substance qua the content which is to be represented" (1970, 13: 467; 1975,1: 363). 19. "The sublime truth" (Lacoue-Labarthe 1983, 85-86): "The truth of the sublime is dia- lectical, is dialectics itself." Hegel merely attests to this superior truth, Lacoue-Labarthe adds. 20. Even in the 1821 lectures on philosophy of religion Hegel stresses the inherence of divine power in speech: it is speech - the address to finite understanding - that is sublime. 21. Guerlac (1985, 276) frames the text "On the Sublime" in such a way that the text itself has the effect of (may be read as) dislocating or deconstructing any stable subject position. Romantic lyric is notorious for the lability of its poetic personae. 22. Thus Wihl, in what is otherwise a perceptive study, suggests that in the final analysis Hegel aims at a "dialectical unification in the name of the sublime" (1994, 181), or that he</page><page sequence="18">1 8 MARTIN DONOUGHO "demand[s] cognitive and performative validity for the use of the sublime/' resulting in "the hierarchization of a legitimating authority" (174). That would ally Hegel's language with the language it quotes, as if to borrow its "transformative power" in the manner of the "Longinian" (Romantic) sublime. But isn't Hegel's "reported speech" in a more dispassion- ate sense? What pathos remains comes from exploring the dangerous edge of inhuman lan- guage, much as with de Man, I shall argue. 23. "To be erhaben (sublime) is not the same, it appears [sc. from Hegel's procedure], as to be erhoben or augehoben" de Man quips (1983, 146), thus opting for the alternative reading. 24. See Wihl (1994, 162-63) for this distinction, drawing on Martin Jay's 1990 criticism of de Man. 25. Cf. On the Sublime ix.10, quoting Genesis 1:3 (Longinus). The same connection is noted in the Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion (2: 433, 136: "The explicit force of utterance is slight, but the infinite power of thought gives it infinite elasticity" - it shows God's power in and over the weak. 26. Note, the philosophy of religion does not echo this division, although the 1831 series treats "humanity" as the "third characteristic" of sublime religion, and proceeds to the dual- ism of good and evil in a way parallel to the Aesthetics (see 1984-87, 2: 438-40n). We read "it is human beings that know, that cognize, that think What is experienced in religion is God who is thought" and thought issues in judgment of good and evil. 27. Hegel speaks of this human perspective ("von Seiten des Menschen") as combining the feeling of one's own finitude with that of the insuperable distance from God (1970, 13: 484; 1975, 1:376). 28. In German: "Licht ist dein Kleid, das du anhast; du breitest aus dem Himmel wie ein Teppich" The mode is more directly apostrophic than in the authorized version (though the "who" implies it). See the lectures (1984-87, 2: 136), where the passage is cited alongside the first, and to make the same point about sheer power. Jaeschke (1990, 202) notes that Hegel followed Herder in linking Psalm 104 and the Genesis creation. In 1824 (Hegel 1984- 87, 2: 434), it reads "Thou girdest thyself with lightning {die Blitze) as with a garment"; that is, nature becomes a mere instrument of God's communication (see 1994, 333). 29. De Man quotes a Pascalian example of this strategy: "In a word, man knows he is miserable. Thus he is miserable since that is what he is. But he is very great inasmuch as he knows it" (1983, 147). 30. The next two paragraphs summarize points made in my forthcoming essay "Stages of the Sublime in North America." 3 1 . The passage begins with the moving statement that "to read is to understand, to ques- tion, to know, to forget, to erase, to deface, to repeat - that is to say, the endless prosopopoeia by which the dead are made to have a face and a voice which tells the allegory of their demise and allows us to apostrophize them in our turn" (de Man 1984, 122). 32. The language is dense, especially as it touches upon the performative force of lan- guage. Wihl (1994, 178-81) is very helpful in disentangling its intricacies. His overall argu- ment, if I grasp it, is that by staying on the linguistic surface, de Man's "situating" of Hegel's texts aims at undoing any sublime effect or dialectical work they might be taken as perform- ing. I find it all the more strange that Wihl chooses not to discuss either de Man's turning against Hegelian ressentiment or de Man's rhetorical performance (at least his use of performatives). Strange, too, but from the opposite direction, is his judgment that de Man's finding of tropes at the foundation of the Aesthetics - the sign, not the symbol - installs a nondialectical element that Hegel would not accept. I argue that that is precisely what Hegel teaches, not merely what we today can extract in interpretation. The sublime, in Hegel's view, is irredeemably finite. 33. The comment on self-ironization footnotes Hertz's "A Reading of Longinus." Hertz concludes his "reading" by noting that when Longinus reproaches Isocrates for exaggerating the power of language, it is because absolute hyperbole collapses absolutely: figures retain power only if we keep somewhat quiet about their operation; hence, one can never come absolutely clean, but must always ironize oneself (though, of course, Longinus couldn't say that one can never say it). De Man is simply explicit where Hertz was ironic.</page><page sequence="19">ON THE HEGELIAN SUBLIME 19 Incidentally, in de Man's view (1990), Kant no less than Hegel escapes the Longinian paradigm, likewise shifting from representation to trope, so that everything reduces to pro- saic mechanics. 34. The phrase becomes almost a motto in de Man's late essays (it is applied even to Bakhtin on the novel), signifying both a danger and a fait accompli within modern thought - the machine of death. De Man cannot justify resistance (e.g., by a Romantic flight from "the prose of the world" or a Heideggerian gesture at authenticity), for he knows that legitimacy and selfhood are both effects of language or rhetoric. Yet neither will he give in easily. It is as if he operates his own interpretive ressentiment against the Hegelian machine. 35. A hint of this is found in the 1821 lectures, where the Book of Job is mentioned in this context (see 144). 36. See his last lecture, entitled "Conclusions: Walter Benjamin's 'The Task of the Trans- lator'" (1990, 73-105, esp. 93). 37. I note that "inscription" is a typically Romantic theme, and one that de Man himself takes up in his final concern with Walter Benjamin. Works cited Bolla, Peter de. 1989.
