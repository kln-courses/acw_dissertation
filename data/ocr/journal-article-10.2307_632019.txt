<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTICES OF BOOKS catalogue is prefaced by a short discussion of the types of pottery as they are represented at Monte Sannace and elsewhere in Apulia. While one can only welcome the publication of material from a significant, but perhaps less well-known, museum, the usefulness of the present work is, unfortun- ately, reduced by two problems. In the first place, the author has not stated clearly what criteria were used in the selection of the material. All the pottery comes from the excavations of 1957-61 or 1976-83 at Monte San- nace, some vases from the acropolis, others from the settlement, many from the tombs, but there is no dis- cussion, or even an index, of the archaeological con- texts, which is particularly disappointing for vases that served as grave-offerings. In fact, the format of the CVA is not intended for the presentation of such excavation material. And it is particularly hard to understand the reason for this volume, when one soon discovers that some of the pieces have already been adequately pub- lished in earlier comprehensive reports on the excava- tions at Monte Sannace, to one of which the author her- self made a major contribution. Indeed, sometimes the earlier publication is more informative: for example, in the case of the fragment on pl. 3, 1, the original publica- tion gives the diameter of the lip, a drawing of the upper surface of the lip, and a profile; and pl. 3, 2 is hardly comprehensible without recourse to the drawing and profile supplied in the original publication. In these circumstances, it would perhaps have been more useful to have concentrated upon one class of pottery (for example, the local matt-painted Peucetian ware), incor- porating a discussion of its presence at the site, or alternately to have kept to unpublished material. The second problem involves the description and attribution of the black-and red-figure pottery. Not only are the descriptions not as accurate as one would like, but the attributions are not always reliable. For example, the fragments illustrated on pls. 36-37, and 39 are all misidentified as Lucanian or Apulian, when they are clearly Attic. The illustrations are generally of reasonable quality, but the printing of the photographs is not always as clear as it could be. The layout is sometimes wasteful, and the figured fragments are not always posed correctly. Given that there are only forty plates and thirty-three pages of text (including introduction, bibliography and indexes), this volume of the CVA hardly represents value for money. I append a few detailed comments: P1. 11, 3 and 4. These have been switched. 3 is Monte Sannace, pls. 178 and 214, 2. Pls. 21-22. The first Amazon must be moving to the left, looking back; the second does not hold a 'scudo a pelta' but a 'Boeotian' shield. Is the charioteer on side B really an Amazon, and not a male in long white garment? P1. 23. The description is incomplete, and the frag- ments should have been rearranged in their proper sequence for photography (and could have been printed on a larger scale). P1. 24, 1. 'Overlap' decoration; the two draped figures are male. P1. 24, 3. Again the fragments have been wrongly composed. PI. 25. Each of the draped males wears a himation but not a chlamys. P1. 28. Details 4 and 5 have been printed in reverse. The left-hand figure on the reverse is a woman, holding a sceptre. P1. 29. The left-hand woman holds clappers (krotala), not a 'black ribbon'. PI. 31. The 'four vertical lines' represent a torch held by the woman. The helmeted figure is probably a mortal warrior, not a divinity. PI. 34-35. This bell-krater is not by the Amykos Painter, but by the Pisticci Painter. The vase is, in fact, listed by Trendall, LCS 21, no. 47. P1. 37, 1. Not Apulian, by the Painter of the Berlin Dancing Girl, but Attic, by the Painter of Louvre G 456 (attribution by Adrienne Lezzi-Hafter). P1. 37, 2-3. Also Attic, a fine early work by the Painter of Louvre G 456 (Adrienne Lezzi-Hafter). About 450-440. What is the subject of the picture on the outside? The running male seems to have something around his lower leg. The head and torso on MG 350 belong to the second figure from the left on MG 349. P1. 39, 1-3. Not Lucanian, of the Intermediate Group, but Attic, about 440-430. P1. 39, 4-6. Not Apulian of the first quarter of the fourth century, but Attic about 440-430. Same cup as pl. 39, 1-3? P1. 40. The two fragmentary cups on this plate are by the same painter: Early Apulian, in the vicinity of the Anabates Painter, to judge from the draped male on the outside. Why was the outside of pl. 30, 1 not illustrated? IAN MCPHEE La Trobe University .BYRNE (M.) The Greek Geometric warrior figurine: interpretation and origin. Louvain and Providence RI: College Erasme and Brown U, 1991. Pp. 256. Fr. b. 2,800. This informative and well illustrated book seeks to examine the reason for the widespread use of the warrior motif during the Geometric period, attempt its interpret- ation, and determine its origin. As the bulk of the material evidence for this study if confined to Olympia and Delphi, both centres of Panhellenic importance, Byrne wisely concentrates his efforts upon the relevant anthropomorphic votive figurines from these two sites. B. argues that the armed male terracotta figurines and the majority of the bronze series of armed male figures from Olympia represent Zeus. Initially, the author bases his argument upon Pausanias' (5.17.1) sighting of a 'crude' statute of Zeus in the Temple of Hera, together with that of Hera, which was standing, bearded and wearing a helmet; most of the terracotta and bronze series are standing and armed, the majority are wearing helmets, a few are bearded. Furthermore, B. sees in these early armed figurines the prototype for the later Zeus stereotype, i.e. bearded and standing, and armed with a thunderbolt. He rightly points out that Zeus in Homer is 'arbiter of war, to whom warriors pray for victory' (28), although his claim that there is a 'special 232</page><page sequence="2">NOTICES OF BOOKS connection between Zeus and armour' because of the great quantity of votive arms and armour unearthed at Olympia is, perhaps, a little wide of the mark (29). Admittedly Olympia houses an unparalleled collection of arms and armour, but this may be due to the simple fact that pieces of armour, having been thrown out, were reutilized as filling-material for the artificial banks of Stadium III, while others were used to help shore up the banks of the Kladeos. When, according to Polybios (5.8.9), the Macedonian soldiery of Philip V sacked Thermon, they took down no less than fifteen thousand suits of armour which had been dedicated to Apollo in the stoas there. Those they did not keep for themselves in exchange for their own battered armour, they melted down. The association between Zeus and war, which B. does indeed cover in a later section of his book, is better confirmed by the god's close affinities with the Semitic Baal and Anatolian Teshub. Both these Near Eastern gods are thunderers and rain-makers, reside on moun- tain-tops, and are represented as bearded, armed and striding in a smiting posture. Both are also associated with the bull, and with a female partner. Delphi's armed figurines demonstrate that the motif of the armed male was not exclusive to Zeus. As these votive figurines postdate the earliest series found at Olympia, B. suggests that Delphi borrowed the motif-which, by the beginning of the eighth century BC, was fully developed, i.e. full warrior position with the right arm raised, bored for a spear, left forearm extended forward, bored for a shield (or, as I would suggest in Apollo's case, an arrow)-from Olympia. In the Iliad, for example, the arrows of Apollo signify pestilence, and B. points to the Canaanite smiting god Reshef who as a plague god shoots firebrands; in Ugarit and on Cyprus he is called Reshef of the Arrow. The author notes further examples of the armed Apollo figure from Thermon, perhaps Kalopodi and, of course, Amyklai (though he fails to mention the identical colossus of Apollo at Thornax attested by Herodotus [1.69] and Pausanias [3.10.8]). Other Geometric sites considered for evidence to support the existence of an armed divinity include Dodona, Tegea, Samos, Lindos, Athens, Sparta and Argos. Argos, for instance, shows up a predominance of armed horsemen in its male series of figurines and, interestingly, this reminds us of Aristotle's comment (Pol. 1297b 16-9) that mounted warriors dominated the warfare of early Greek communities at the time of the disappearance of kingship and the transition to aristo- cratic rule. Despite the fact that these sites offer fewer examples of the armed male figurine, the evidence offered is important as it does confirm the interpretation of an armed Zeus at Olympia and an armed Apollo at Delphi. Although Baal and Reshef were, iconographically and functionally, closely akin to Zeus and Apollo, B. rigorously pursues the idea that the adoption of the armed warrior motif in mainland Greece was not due to direct influence from the Near East but was borrowed from Crete. He stresses that Cretan characteristics, such as symmetrical arm and leg position, the roccTxo; headdress, and beaky type of facial modelling, are to be found in several of the figurines from Olympia and Delphi. B. also points to the close association of both Zeus and Apollo with Crete, and that between the second and first millennium BC an armed male divinity was clearly worshipped on the island; this cult goes back at least to the MM III, before the importation of Near Eastern armed figurines into the Aegean area, with a fully-developed smiting gesture appearing in Minoan and Mycenaean iconography as early as LM IA. The empha- sis on the theme of the armed male is also apparent when the author considers Cypriot material, and he postulates that Cyprus was perhaps the point of transfer of the motif from the Near East. For the ancient Greeks there was no single and exclusive god of war. True, we are accustomed to view Ares as such-he is the ultimate personification of the lust for battle-but Ares does side with the ultimate losers of the Trojan War. In the Iliad, for instance, we read that Hector promises to dedicate the armour of his opponent to Apollo, and Odysseus hands over Dolon's fur cap, bow and spear to Athena (7.8.1-3; 10.458-64). .In particular, no less dreadful upon the field of battle are Zeus the Leader, Zeus Victorious and Zeus of the Rout, and it is hardly surprising, therefore, to witness the power of the strongest of Olympian gods manifesting itself in a martial context. This shift from the prehistoric cult of the all important female divinity (the Great Mother), who was invariably accompanied by a less important male partner (the Young God), to the cult of a male who is potent in warfare, as B. cogently sums up, coincides with the shift from a predominantly pastoral society with primary needs based on preservation and continuation of livestock, to a more urbanized community with primary needs of protection of the city and its wealth. Religion, says B., adapts to changing circum- stances and the threat of war appears to have favoured the growth in importance of a male war god. NIC FIELDS Athens KOTANSKY (R.)
