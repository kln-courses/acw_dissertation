<plain_text><page sequence="1">The African Collection of the Wereldmuseum Rotterdam ERNA BEUMERS with PETER ABSPOEL This article is drawn from the exhibition cat- alogue Africa Meets Africa: The African Collection of the Museum of Ethnology Rotterdam, which includes the essay "The Challenge of Otherness," by Erna Beumers with Peter Abspoel. The captions were writ- ten by a variety of scholars, as noted.1 frica does not exist. There are many different Africas. That is why "Africa Meets Africa," the title of an exhi- bition organized by the Museum voor Volken- kunde in Rotterdam-in January 2000 renamed the Wereldmuseum (World Mu- seum) Rotterdam-is not as strange as one might at first think.2 In order to look at the Africas we meet, and which meet each other, in the collection that the museum has built up over the past centu- ry, we should think not only of the kalei- doscopic diversity of cultures within the continent, or of the old and the new Africa, but also of the various images of Africa that have existed in the minds of collectors and curators. At first sight a collection appears to be a clearly defined, contained entity. The objects seem to have been saved from the ocean of material life that is ruled by human motives and emotions, an ocean whose depths are often unfathomable. It is as if they begin a new life in the muse- um. Insufficient information about the works' origin and function (some were brought to the Wereldmuseum with no more information than "place of origin: Africa") makes it even easier to delude oneself. The tangibility of the pieces often makes it hard for the viewer to enter into the much more impalpable worlds to which they implicitly refer-cultural worlds in which they had their own places and meanings, as well as the worlds they traversed on their way to the museum, without which one cannot explain that the object is here. But in the West, African works of art have all too african arts - spring 2000 18</page><page sequence="2">often served as the figureheads of "African culture," with no one asking what the ship looks like. Over the past century, however, our knowledge of Africa has grown enormously, thanks to a more intensive cultural exchange and the efforts of antuhopologists, historians, archaeologists, and other scholars and scientists. We have much more information about the functions and meanings of the pieces that make up the African collection. Against this factual background it becomes easier to distinguish the various views of the continent that lie at the foundation of the collecting policies of individuals and insti- tutions. And it therefore follows that it is time,to shed light on African collections in a new way so that outmoded notions about African cultures and African art will not be reinforced. For exam- ple, it appears that many people still tend to project a static view of culture onto Africa's past and to believe that "classical" African works of art have grown on those societies as apples do on a tree. By consistently presenting traditional and contemporary art sep- arately, one suggests that traditional and modem Africa have nothing to say to one another, and a misconception is kept alive. The exhibition "Africa Meets Africa" confronted the viewer not merely with a collection but also with a conference, as it were, of African artworks that whispered stories to one another about their former lives and how they came to be here. In this way the exhibition and its catalogue were intended as a monument to the African artists who made the beautiful and fascinating objects, to the lives in which the objects once participated, and to the collectors who opened the eyes of Westerners to the beau- ty and significance of African art-in short, a monument hon- oring all those who made it possible for us to see these works. The title "Africa Meets Africa" also refers to the fact that the ex- hibition traveled to South Africa, making it the first time a Western collection of African art was shown in the continent of origin.3 The Early Collection The exhibited works were selected from a collection of more than 10,000 pieces. How and why did they end up in the museum in the course of the last 110 years? What did the more than 300 people who collected them see in them? Why are objects from certain areas and certain categories represented more than others? Such ques- tions evoke a kind of portrait gallery of merchants, explorers, mis- sionaries, private collectors, curators, and many other figures, all of whom have looked at African culture from their own perspectives. The foundation of the collection was laid in the last fifteen years of the nineteenth century, when Dutch involvement with Africa took the form of trade contacts, expeditions, and efforts to convert the "natives" to Christianity. Among the Wereldmuseum's first patrons was Hendrik Muller, director of the Nieuwe Afrikaansche All photographs by Erik Hesmerg, Sneek, courtesy of the Wereldmuseum Rotterdam. 1. Mask (mahgle). Dan or We, Liberia or C6te d'lvoire. Wood, fiber; 35cm (13.8'). Donated by S. P. l'Honore-Naber, The Hague, and J. J. Moret, Rotter- dam, 1909. MWR 16811. This mask represents a being, part human, part bird (mah=bird, g/e=mask spirit), whose functions are to entertain and inform by dancing and singing, and to bless people. The Dan believe that certain birds portend good for- tune, particularly when encountered on a perilous journey. A mask carved in the likeness of one of these birds is believed to bring good luck to its owner and his family. This particular piece is a superb example of art from the Dan or We peo- ple. It is exceptionally well carved and patinated. The slit eyes and vertical forehead tattoo are characteristic of the most frequently seen type of Dan mask. It represents the face of a beautiful woman. The slumberous eyelids and high, curved forehead are thought by the Dan to be evidence of great beauty. The lower half of the face becomes the beak of the bird, while the vertical forehead line continues to the tip. It also has a braided fiber beard and peripheral holes for the attachment of the headdress. (For a similar example, see Fischer &amp; Himmelheber 1984:77.) Barbara C. Johnson 19</page><page sequence="3"></page><page sequence="4">2. Dance mask (mukuyi). Punu-Lumbo, Gabon. Wood, paint; 30cm (11.8"). Acquired from M.L.J. Lemaire, Amsterdam, 1950. MVVR 30271. Southeastern Gabon, along the Ngounie and Nyanga river valleys, is home to a number of peoples-the Shira, Punu, Vungu, and Lumbo-who share cultural traditions. One of these is the use of wooden masks whose ideal- ized faces, fixed in expression, are painted in white clay. Called mukuyi, they are worn by performers who dance on tall stilts during public funerals and mourning ceremonies. Although their appearance recalls the masks of the Japanese no theater, this resemblance is coincidental. The Rotterdam mask was probably collected in the mid-Ngounie region. It has an elaborate coiffure, blackened and polished, with a double shell-like form at the center. The prominent forehead is marked with red scales rep- resenting scarification. Modeled with great elegance, this mask epitomizes the classic Punu-Lumbo style. Louis Perrois Handelsvennootschap (New African Trade Company). His com- pany's main post was in Banana, at the mouth of the Congo River. Mr. Muller immediately put his distinctive stamp on the muse- um's collection; it is due to him that the Lower Congo region from the outset became one of its focal points. One of the expeditions which yielded valuable objects for the museum was the 1885 journey to Angola by L. J. Godefroy and Daniel D. Veth, which Veth did not survive. Nearly every object acquired on that expedition wound up in the Rotterdam collection, partly owing to Mr. Muller, who had helped fund the journey. Another enterprise that bore fruit was the trip to Liberia made by the Dutch navy lieutenants S. P. l'Honore-Naber and J. J. Moret, who represented the Liberian government in a border dispute with French Guinea. Despite encountering many problems on their journey, they collected weapons, tools, household articles, textiles, and domestic money in the border villages through which they traveled. The lieutenants managed to transport these items to the coast, and when they returned to the Netherlands in 1909, they gave them to the museum, including what has become one of its most important pieces, a Dan or We mask (Fig. 1). In addition, the Nederlandsche Zendingsgenootschap (Dutch Missionary Society) donated a number of extremely valuable "fetishes," initially collected because the missionaries felt the people were better off without them. Private individuals also contributed to the museum's hold- ings. For example, in 1886 E. A. Brunner, who lived in the South African hinterland, lent (and later donated) to the museum his collection consisting mainly of Zulu weapons. The documentation that accompanied these earliest pieces is just as nondescript as the tales surrounding their collection are interesting. The location where a piece was collected is known only in a few instances, and even then we have no information about where it was made or used, since many of the objects acquired at trading posts came from elsewhere. On top of all that, the documentation accompanying the extensive and extremely important collection donated in 1939 by the Rotterdam Zoological Society (Vereeniging Rotterdamsche Diergaarde), the present-day Blijdorp Zoological Gardens, was lost in a fire in 1940. Of course, the development of the African holdings was not solely the result of the interests of various external collectors, although these individuals did exert an important influence owing to their donations of substantial specialized material. But beginning in 1902 the museum began purchasing objects on its own. It bought important collections from the Antwerp antique dealer H. Pareyn. Others were acquired or enlarged with the help of other museums, such as the Musee d'Ethnographie in spring 2000 ? african arts Neuchatel, the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, and the Museum fur Volkerkunde Berlin. In 1955 the Wereldmuseum received an extensive and highly valuable collection of weapons from the Wellcome Medical Historical Museum in London. Twentieth-Century Developments Over time the museum's collecting policy has become increasing- ly specialized. By the beginning of the twentieth century, some collections, such as that of musical instruments, had already been systematically enlarged; later, those of weapons and jewelry would also be augmented. Specialization by region has also become a matter of policy (through agreements with other muse- ums) and less haphazard. The 1960s saw an even sharper focus in the purchasing policy. The Africa curator at the time, Dr. C. op't Land, aimed to present genres de vie; he wanted to give the visitor a representative view of Africa, using the material culture of four west African peoples: the Dogon, Lobi, Mossi, and Fulani. In the 1960s the museum began organizing its own collecting trips. The Tellem and Dogon expeditions to Mali by the Rotterdam architect H. F C. Haan, which won him the title of honorary curator, supplied a treasure trove of material. Dr. C. op't Land himself went to Africa in 1969 and 1971 in order to expand specific collections. He was also the first curator to buy modern African art. Since then, acquisition policy has been increasingly linked to exhibition planning. In 1986 Dr. R. M. A. Bedaux (then of the Institute of Anthropobiology at Utrecht and currently African curator at the Museum voor Volkenkunde in Leiden) added to the Dogon collection while G. G6ttler collected among the Wodaabe in Niger, both for the exhibition "Alle dagen feest" (Every Day a Feast Day). Similarly, purchases from art dealers were usually made with specific exhibitions in mind. Since the 1980s the museum has increasingly placed an accent on the presentation of "art" in its cultural context. And that con- text is no longer regarded as static but as dynamic. Within the new philosophy there is also room for acquiring new forms of art. Works by filmmakers and photographers have been includ- ed alongside works by contemporary painters and sculptors. In 1987 (for the first time!) the museum presented the best pieces from the entire collection in the exhibition "Schatten van het Museum voor Volkenkunde Rotterdam" (Treasures from the Museum of Ethnology Rotterdam). The exhibitions "Tweede begrafenis: Rouwen in Afrika" (Second Burial: Mourning in Africa, 1988) and "Wijzen, heksen, heiligen: Oud in Afrika" (Sages, Witches and Saints: Aging in Africa, 1994) strove, with the help of the aesthetic power of the artworks, to confront the visitor with essential facets of African world views. In the last two exhibitions, traditional and contemporary art appeared side by side to demonstrate that African cultures are dynamic. I col- lected a number of modern pieces "in the field" myself, while others were bought from the artist through third parties. The exhibitions "Terugkeer van de maan" (Return of the Moon, 1993) and "Visions from Venda" (1994) were devoted solely to contemporary art from southern Africa. The Kuru Art Centre in Botswana arranged a loan of San ("Bushman") art- work for the former exhibition, and the Everard Read Contemporary Gallery in Johannesburg loaned (and, in some instances, sold) works by Venda artists for the latter. 21</page><page sequence="5">Acquisition policy is now aimed at following contemporary trends in African art on the one hand and expanding the exist- ing core collections on the other. In 1995 Piet and Ida Sanders donated their collection consisting mainly of masks and sculptures to the museum. In one fell swoop they did more for the museum than decades of acquisition. This enrichment of our traditional collection has allowed us to show stylistic variation within a single culture and to highlight the role of individual artists. From Ethnography to Art Looking back on the museum's acquisition policy, which stretches back for more than a century, I can distinguish three periods that more or less reflect the changing attitude of Westerners toward African art. During the first period, Africa, in more ways than one, was considered a "dark continent": obscure, un-Christianized, and pervaded by occult threats. This point of view engendered relatively more interest in the awe- inspiring objects, such as masks, fetishes, and weapons. Then came a period when the focus was on more mundane aspects, as the museum tried to acquire collections that afforded a more representative view of everyday life in various cultures. But even though this approach was something of a necessary cor- rective measure, it could nevertheless prevent one from getting at the heart of these cultures. One could characterize the last, present-day period, therefore, as concerned with highlighting the aesthetic quality of African art in order to foster respect for the continent's cultures and world views. As some ethnological museums are beginning to shift more attention to collecting and exhibiting "art," it is no wonder that the debate rages as to where African art actually belongs: in the museum of art or of ethnography. In my view, this is a fruitless discussion. A conscientious presentation of African art asks curators of both art and ethnographic institutions to challenge preconceived, hackneyed notions. The former should question the canons of Western art, and the latter should realize that cat- egorizing a people does an injustice to their deeper aspirations. All works of art affect viewers in ways that are difficult to express in words; but if they challenge them to venture off the beaten paths of pure aesthetic experience, then, in my view, nei- ther of these two types of Western museum has the right to claim a monopoly on presentation. Four Representative Sculptures The centerpiece of the exhibition "Africa Meets Africa" was the recent donation by Mr. and Mrs. Sanders. It was supplemented by approximately two hundred pieces from the extant collec- tion. Why were these works of art chosen? I would like to use four pieces to illustrate the main reasons. First, there are objects one simply cannot ignore. These are our "top pieces," the protagonists in the history of the collec- tion, which have been frequently exhibited and published. A good example is a power figure (nkisi) donated to the museum by missionaries who could never be accused of having warmed to it (Fig. 27). The museum file gives us a tantalizing glimpse of the piece's eventful life. Presumably for quite some time, it had served as the embodiment of the power of a deity; the nails dri- 22 ven into it served to bring about some kind of ordeal, which helped to preserve the order of the cosmos. The Fetish...is called Mabiala-Mandemba. The piece is a roughly chiseled block of wood, 0.71 m high, and comes from Loango (southwestern coast of Africa). The Loango Negroes held this fetish in such high esteem that they transported it in a ham- mock and steadfastly refused, even for a huge fee, to hand it over to Europeans. It was later taken as booty by French soldiers, who in turn gave it to a traveler. This person sold it to our Rotterdam friends, who then let us have a look at it. (Mission Gazette of the Dutch Missionary Society, Nov. 6, 1893) Once acquired by the museum, the piece soon took on the air of "the grand old man," first because of its status as an authentic nkisi of great antiquity, and later because of its stylistic pedigree. Among other examples it was on view in the "Expressions of Belief' exhi- bition that toured the United States in 1988, and it was included in publications such as Astonishment and Power (MacGaffey, Driskell &amp; Harris 1993). Recently, after painstaking study, our restorer put back a number of nails which had come loose, with a dedication almost reminiscent of the religious awe the piece once evoked. It is a sculp- ture that seems never to have served, but always to have ruled. Another piece, just as famous, makes no claim whatsoever to being "authentic," and it does not inspire awe. I am referring here to the sculpture of two bearers and a white man in a hammock (Cover). This early example of tourist art made by a Bembe artist, and probably commissioned, has appeared in many exhibitions ("Afrikaanse Kunst in Nederland," Leiden, 1947; "Crossroads Africa," Stockholm, 1984; "Expressions of Belief," United States, 1988) and publications. Its realistic rendering gives the piece its strong appeal, and in spite of its belonging to a new genre, it is characteristic of the art from the Lower Congo region. The anec- dotal scene is an implicit commentary on the relationship between Africans and Europeans during the colonial era. An excerpt from the diary of Lodewijk Kerdijk (1831-1861), who was in Africa working for the Rotterdam firm of Kerdijk and Pincoffs, gives us some idea of the reality to which this piece refers: 3. Mask (nyatti). Duala, Cameroon. Wood, paint, iron; 70cm (27.6"). Acquired from the Berg collection, Museum fOr Volkerkunde, Berlin, 1909. MWR 15454. Masks in the form of a buffalo head are a typical precolonial art form of the Duala of the central coastal forest zone of Cameroon. It is possible that they were among the paraphernalia of various secret societies or cult associa- tions collectively known as Losango. These served to initiate male youths into the norms of social and moral behavior. At the same time they enforced these norms by acting as an institutionalized agency for regulating social behavior. Association members wore masks depicting certain animal images (most often buffalo heads)-horizontally on the head, tilting slightly forward-when exercising their policing function and honoring their dead at a final funerary rite. Bovine images symbolize might and power in some of the neighboring art traditions, and this symbolism may apply to these Duala masks as well, although we do not have exact information about their function and mean- ing. They may represent one of the Duala water spirits, njona, which is described by Theodore Monod (1929:15-18) as a horned aquatic monster resembling a pig or a buffalo. The mask is sculpted in the softly rounded forms typical of the precolo- nial Duala style, which never displayed a fully three-dimensional plasticity. The curved horns nearly meet (one of them is broken off), forming an oval or circle. Also typical is the surface painted in light-dark contrasting colors whose juxtaposition is here further intensified by the checkerboard pattern.

However, in the beginning this type of travel is extremely unpleas- ant. Because the bearers move at a relentless trot, they cause the same sort of motion as a horse does, and since one is on one's back, one can feel his stomach sink between his shoulders, a movement which cannot be sustained since one constantly feels the urge to vomit. However, once the stomach has become convinced that it won't throw up, the motion becomes less unbearable, and one can call himself a hammock traveler. Each traveler has four to six bearers at his disposal, who take turns. Two bearers travel ten miles in one turn.... During the journey the Negroes babble on, making such a racket as to be unbearable, occasionally break- ing into song, which would pain a musical ear. However, one quickly becomes accustomed to it and does not hear it anymore, and would wake up if one were asleep, if these roisterers were suddenly to cease. The reader almost gets the impression that Europeans took home such scenes as these as mementos of the awful hardships Opposite page: 4. Mask. Igbo Ekpeya, Nigeria. Wood, pigment; length 208cm (81.9"). Donated by Prof. Dr. P. and Mrs. I. Sanders, Schiedam, 1996. MWR 73818. Perhaps representing a shark or ray, this headdress, worn in a horizontal posi- tion in dances, is part of a male water-spirit masquerade cult imported into southern Igbo areas from the Abua or the Kalabari Ijaw farther to the south. It was doubtless part of an ensemble of aquatic spirits which danced vigorously during dry-season festivals and probably at funerals of important people. The headdress includes numerous virtuosic embellishments on the basic armature of a finned creature, particularly along the extended snout, as if to reiterate and emphasize the teeth shown along the bottom. Unusual here is the practice of piecing together separately carved elements, a technique suggesting Euro- pean influence, which is especially strong in some Niger Delta works of art. Herbert M. Cole This page: Top: 5. Mask. Mumuye, Nigeria. Patinated wood, pigment, berries; 36cm (14.2'). Donated by Prof. Dr. P. and Mrs. I. Sanders, Schiedam, 1995. MWR 73139. As with most Mumuye sculptures, the face of this mask is greatly simplified. Only the eyes are indicated, by means of two circles of red and black berries. The use of berries on a sculpture or mask is known but not wide- spread among the Mumuye. The folded disc-shaped form probably repre- sents the crested hairstyle worn by both men and women. Coiffure and ears often form a unit, as seen here. Masks are worn by the members of various secret societies. We do not have any information about the use and function of this mask type, of which no other example is known. Frank Herreman Bottom: 6. Figure. Mumuye, Nigeria. Patinated wood; 61cm (24"). Donated by Prof. Dr. P. and Mrs. I. Sanders, Schiedam, 1995. MWR 73132. The art of the Mumuye is remarkable for its diverse renderings of the human form. However, a number of formal traits recur. The form of the figure as a whole is stressed at the expense of the details. The head is usually proportionally small, which is exceptional in African sculpture. Most striking are the hourglass- shaped torso and the configuration of the space between it and the long arms. Some sculptures are so similar that they can be attributed with a fair amount of certainty to one artist or to his pupils or other imitators. The figure shown here bears a particularly close resemblance to one sculpture in a generally similar group (see Herreman 1988, cat. no. 135), which leads to speculation that both were made by the same artist. The Mumuye use their anthropomorphic figures for dealing with epi- demics and floods and as supernatural weapons in times of war. They.are also brought out during fertility rites.

Loango coast, Congo-Brazzaville (Republic of the Congo). Wood, skin, pigment; 87cm (34.3") and 101.5cm (40'). Donated by the Vereeniging Rotterdamsche Diergaarde, Rotterdam, 1939. MWR 28561 and 28560. These elaborately figurative drums are part of the shrine to Maloango, a major founding spirit of the Loango kingdom, who, like most minkisi, requires spe- cific drums, rhythms, ritualized behavior, and songs. Kurt Krieger describes a similar Maloango drum in the Museum fOr Volkerkunde, Berlin, collected in 1896 by Robert Visser: "This altar may stand only in the king's residence, and is used at festive occasions, at which time a story is recounted by the priest for each figure in turn" (Krieger 1969:50-51, pls. 150-51). The same text re- fers to another Maloango altar in Dusseldorf, also collected by Visser, stating that the drum is played by the priest on important occasions. The works illustrated here reflect the Europeanized dress of Loango coast society, although the stylistic elements of the figural tradition are also in evidence in the wide, staring eyes that elicit strong interaction with the beholder. The drums reflect a common equatorial and west African icono- graphic technique of portraying a spirit hierarchy by visual means. John M. Janzen Reinhild Kauenhoven-Janzen This page: 9. Beer pot (ogono neO). Dogon, Mali. Pottery, 22cm (8.7'). Collected by H.F.C. Haan, Rotterdam, 1960. MWR 52288. At most places in the Dogon region, making earthenware pottery is an exclusively female activity. However, in the village of Sarnyere, at the periph- ery of the Dogon region, it is done only by men. The amount of pottery pro- duced varies greatly from one place to another. The presence of the right kind of clay certainly plays a role, as do taboos on the making of earthen- ware, such those in the village of Sanga and several other villages on the Bandiagara plateau. Earthenware is usually made for personal use. Clever women potters also produce ware for sale at local markets. This pot was made with the hammer-and-anvil technique used by Dogon women. The outer surface shows the impressions of the gunny that covered the anvil stone. A woman fills beer pots like this one with fresh home-brewed millet beer for her husband. Only men are allowed to drink from them. Rogier M. A. Bedaux spring 2000 ? atrican arts 27</page><page sequence="11">they had to withstand! But if that is the case, the maker of this piece seems to have perfectly sensed and portrayed the irony of the situation. The sculpture is also important because it points out that changes within African art traditions- changes which even affected the role of art-took place quite early on, and that they did nothing to diminish the power of African art. A work like this proves there is no such thing as a "missing link" between traditional and modern African art. It belies the idea that artists in traditional African societies had little room to exhibit creative innovation. Just as interesting as the early pieces that indicate the dynamism of art traditions are the modern pieces that give new shape to longstanding concepts. The Togolese sculptor and priest Agbagli Kossi made sculptures that break with tradition as far as their form is concerned but retain the same function as conventional "fetishes": they are meant to protect people from calamity. Many of his sculptures are modeled on Asian gods but depict the spirits or gods to which the local cults are devoted. Those cults, some of which have been heavily influenced by Africans from the diaspora, are themselves examples of syn- cretism. One cult with deep roots in traditional religion, and which in fact has only recently become "modernized," is that of the god of iron, Egou. Egou is regarded as malevolent and there- fore as responsible for all accidents having to do with metallic objects, such as cars. People hope to prevent these mishaps by placating him with blood sacrifices. Shrines devoted to this god are served by young girls. A statue by Kossi represents one of those servants; it is painted red, as she would be in reality (Fig. 28). This figure and other works by Kossi were included in the exhibition because they show-in a surprising, modern artistic language-the vitality of African traditions. The statue retains its power even if separated from its cultural context. The South African artist Arlene Amaler-Raviv was so moved by the piece that she incorporated it into one of her paintings. "She engages the viewer with her eyes directly focused," she said, explaining her fascination with the statue. "It is the intensity of the color that creates this symbol of strength. With her simple, proud form, she embodies the power of women." We included other objects in "Africa Meets Africa" because they represent important subcollections within the museum's African holdings. The weapons collection enjoys international acclaim. Of interest, too, is the South African material that includes snuff boxes, neckrests, and ceremonial staffs. The cho- sen objects are appealing because of their strong form and therefore point to the aesthetic values found in the traditional. A splendid example is a Zulu ceremonial axe with a strange round blade (Fig. 15) that testifies not only to the craftsmanship of its maker but also to his eye for monumental form. It also rep- resents a rare example of a specific type. The objects seen in the illustrated section of the exhibition catalogue, some of which are shown here, are described from various points of view. Most of the texts for these works were written by specialists on certain cultures or categories of objects. They provide information about the role and meaning of the objects in their original contexts. Other commentaries are by Arlene Amaler-Raviv, who invites us to consider the aesthetic quality of the pieces. Finally, I have written about recent acquisitions in which I describe how and why they came into the museum's possession. In this manner we invite 28 readers to look at the works from three different perspectives: anthropological, aesthetic, and historical. I hope these three approaches will be lent significance by the encounter with the objects themselves. The history of the African collection at the Wereldmuseum Rotterdam is also the history of the confrontation with other cultures not easily grasped on Western terms. Even though they do not appear to have been bound by anything more than the arbitrariness of their taste, the objects' collectors have neverthe- less acted as spiritual antennae for the West; their fascination enabled the transmission of a kind of coded message which we can only decipher bit by bit, by allowing ourselves to be moved by the worlds that shimmer through the artworks. Even in the case of the oldest sculptures, it is hard to imagine that it was not owing to their expressive force that they are now in the muse- um; that they did not move people, no matter which Africa they projected around them. These works challenge us to ask our- selves where their power comes from and what their forms depict. When we accept this challenge, then perhaps, after hav- ing digested all the information, we might be able to experience some of the power that has nourished African life and that pro- pels it onward, toward the future. D Notes, page 94 Clockwise from top left: 10. Spoon. Congo region, Congo-Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of the Congo) or Congo-Brazzaville (Republic of the Congo). Wood, length 30.5cm (12"). Donated to the Vereeniging Rotterdamsche Diergaarde by J. G. Gerken, 1891; donated by the Vereeniging Rotterdamsche Diergaarde, 1939. MWR 28574. 11. Throne. Chokwe, Angola. Wood, hide, brass tacks, beads; 58cm (22.8"). Acquired from H. Pareyn, Antwerp, 1911. MVVR 18963. This chief's throne is a copy of the European straight-backed chair, which was introduced into Chokwe country during the eighteenth century by the trade caravans that linked the coast of Angola to the High Zambesi. Chairs like these gradually replaced the chief's low, round, anvil-shaped stool. The Chokwe, who were skilled carvers, first made their reproductions from a single piece of hollowed-out wood. They then learned to be more faithful to the original, pro- ducing a work assembled with dowels and with mortises and tenons. This ex- ample used both techniques. The front part is made of a single piece of wood, and the rest is assembled from individual parts. As the first replicas were com- paratively low, the small size of this chair suggests that it is relatively old. The center of the chair back is decorated with the dance mask Pwo, evoking the ancestress who attends to the fertility of the population. Copper nails grouped into triangles and diamonds represent the village fires that shine at night like the stars in the firmament. The sturdy male effigy attached to the front rungs is executed virtually in the round. It symbolizes the ances- tral spirits of the chief who safeguard their descendants and their subjects. Marie-Louise Bastin 12. Drinking vessel (koopa). Suku, Bandundu, Congo-Kinshasa. Wood, 9.7cm (3.8"). Acquired from J.E.A. van den Andel, 1912; on loan since 1905. MVVR 12663. A Suku headman or regional chief used this double-mouthed vessel for the ritual drinking of palm wine. It served as a symbol of transmission of author- ity. Other persons were forbidden to touch the cup without the owner's per- mission, a restriction reinforced by the image featured on its sides. A carved face with downcast eyes is said to represent the hemba nkisi and duplicates the features of the Suku helmet mask. The mustache-like incised lines and slightly upturned nose were observed on cups still being used in the Kiamfu Kinzadi locale on the Inzia River in 1976. The decoration that edges the double mouth on Suku drinking vessels ranges from lozenge shapes and winged inverted triangles to a series of concentric circles. When examples from a given locale are compared, the wide range of individual carving styles is striking.

Glass beads, thread, trade cloth; 102cm x 87.5cm (40.2" x 34.4"). Donated by J. Schijff, Rotterdam, 1913. MWR 21101. This piece could be a cape or a pregnancy apron (worn over the breasts and abdomen). Its origins are difficult to pinpoint. The form resembles that of a few early southern Nguni pieces, but the beadwork does not. Beaded circles joined by beaded lines can be found in San work such as a mater- nity apron at the Johannesburg Art Gallery. In that example the symbols, beaded onto a small antelope skin, would surely have had a protective func- tion. Another example of this pattern of linked circles can be found in the Ndebele cloak pictured in Africa: The Art of a Continent (Phillips 1995:217). The cape illustrated here is distinctly Ndebele in form, but its beadwork is atypical and probably very early, surely dating from the 19th century. I feel that this linked-circle design relates to the early Sotho who, like other groups in South Africa, mixed and intermarried with the San. This piece, therefore, could be an early example of San-Sotho influence on southern Nguni beadwork. Marilee Wood Opposite page: 14. War knife (fa) and scabbard. Fang, Gabon. Iron, wood, leather, brass, iron; length 50cm (19.7"). Acquired in 1917. MWR 24138. Virtually all Fang men of some status carried such knives called fa. The owner of this example must also have had a gun for war and hunting, for attached to the loop of the scabbard is a powder flask of wood, covered with leather, iron wire, and sheet metal. Also attached is an iron pin set in a wooden grip wound with brass wire, most certainly used in musketry. The lancet-like blade is fullered and fixed on the grip with a crossguard. The scabbard consists of a two-part wooden frame enclosed in lizard skin, as is usual. The bonus here is the sheet-brass covering embellished with repousse patterns. Similar pieces are rare. The sheath of this fa counts among the ten best examples I have ever seen. Peter Westerdijk atrican arts ? spring 2000 30</page><page sequence="14">CO t= C,3 ai</page><page sequence="15">Top: 15. Ceremonial axe (isizenze). Zulu, South Africa. Wood, iron; length 63.5cm (25"). Legacy of E.A. Brunner, 1920; on loan since 1886. MWR 3467. Ceremonial axes were carried as signs of office among the Nguni. This flat, circular blade differs from the more commonly seen widely flared, arrow- head-shaped blades with their attenuated tips facing backward. In this unusual example the circular blade is shafted into a long hardwood han- dle. The stick swells toward the top, where the blade is inserted and secured by bending the shaft tip upward. The practice of carrying axes to ceremonial occasions has largely died out among most of the Nguni, but it still exists among the Swazi when the king summons his regiments to the royal enclosure. Karel Nel Bottom: 16. Prestige knives. Dzing, Yanzi, Lwer, or Ngul; Congo-Kinshasa. Iron, wood, brass; length 26cm (10.2") and 27cm (10.6'). Acquired from A. Sturms-Scheuer in 1919; on loan since 1908. MWR 14697 and unnumbered. Prestige knives of the type shown here were made and used by the Dzing or their neighbors the Yanzi, Lwer, and Ngul of Bandundu Province. The huge blades are ogee-shaped. The small wooden grips are partly covered with sheet metal (brass or copper or both) and wire. Although sometimes described in the early literature as throwing knives, such objects were certainly not used as missiles. Men of power wielded them at public gatherings as emblems of rank. Comparable pieces of this period (around 1900) are rare. Peter Westerdijk atrican arts ? spring 2000 32</page><page sequence="16">Left: 17. Power figure (nkisi). Lower Congo region. Wood, glass, pigment; 83cm (32.7'). Donated by the Vereeniging Rotterdamsche Diergaarde, Rotter- dam, 1939. MWR 28499. This male figure exemplifies a common type of nkisi that displays a defen- sive or offensive pose; a raised spear or gun is a witch-finding or witch- repelling gesture. The motif of the witch gun, widespread in Kongo lore, is an expression of the magician-priest's role in warding off invisible evil in society. This piece was perhaps purchased before it was used for nkisi pur- poses, since it exhibits no evidence of ritual use or application of medicines. It might have been created for commercial sale, since the realistic render- ing of clothing is atypical of functional nkisi figures. The same may be said of the base, but if it was intended to be integral to the figure, one must take note of the cosmogram painted on its front, which outlines the ritual universe of Kongo religion. In spite of any question that might be raised about the intention of the artist, this piece carries its own convincing aesthetic logic. John M. Janzen Reinhild Kauenhoven-Janzen Right: 18. Figure. Sakalava(?), Madagascar. Wood; 67cm (26.4"). Acquired from Galerie Groen, Vlaardingen, 1988, for the exhibition "Second Funeral: Mourning in Africa." MWR 70917. Among the Sakalava and other peoples, figures like this one form the tops of poles placed on the graves of people of high rank. The poles, which vary in height from two to four meters, are called aloala. The name derives from the word alo, which means intermediary or messenger; the ancestors are seen as messengers between the human and the spirit worlds. The ances- tors play an important role in the daily life of the Sakalava, who seek their help in many situations.

Lemaire, Amsterdam, 1950. MWR 30918. The anthropomorphous bowstand is an original Luba creation, derived from a tripod on which hunters put sacrifices for the spirits. It became the sym- bol of the hunter-king Kalala Ilungu, and accordingly a symbol of kingship and the royal clans. The female figure may represent either the mother of the chief under whose leadership the Luba migrated, or else the female founders of the royal clans. The bowstand was a sacred object that was kept at a secret place, wrapped in a mat. It became a symbol of the invisible enemies that the king had to drive out of his realm. The woman standing on the scepter holds her hands on her breast, showing that she feeds her people. This exceptional sculpture comes from the center of the Luba region, probably from near Malemba-Nkulu, and dates from the end of the nineteenth century. Francois Neyt spring 2000 ? atrican arts This page: Left: 20. Power figure. Angola(?). Wood, fiber, cotton; 41.5cm (16.3"). Donated to the Vereeniging Rotterdamsche Diergaarde by G.W. Hanken in 1893; donat- ed by the Vereeniging Rotterdamsche Diergaarde, 1939. MWR 28509. The face of this female figure has very little relief modeling, and the eyes and nose have lost their original shape. The exposed wood is almost entire- ly covered with a thick layer of camwood powder (ngula). The lower half of the figure is covered by fiber meshwork, from which only the toes emerge. Joseph A. Cornet Right: 21. Statuette. Mbala, Bandundu. Congo-Kinshasa. Wood, pigment; 24cm (9.4'). Acquired from J.E.A. van den Andel, 1912; on loan from 1905. MWR 12770. This Mbala statuette was collected in the Kwilu River region, as indicated by documentation in the museum's archives that it is from "Djoema" (Djuma). Its short legs, bent knees, and aloof facial mien are typical, but the outward positioning of the hands is unique and particularly charming. In general, Mbala statuettes served to heal, protect, retaliate, and pro- duce success. The red and white pigment indicates a specific use against the evil of bandoki (the witches): to neutralize the effect of a curse and thus to safeguard the well-being of lineage members. Arthur P Bourgeois 35 I</page><page sequence="19">This page: Left: 22. Power figure (nkisi). Kongo, Lower Congo. Wood, glass, seashells, pigment; 25cm (9.8"). Donated by J. Boshom, Rotterdam, 1892. MWR 4075. The enormous amplification of the abdomen of this figure through the attach- ment of a medicine-filled cavity illustrates a major technique in Kongo nkisi- making and reveals a major tenet of Kongo thought and ritual. These figures commonly contain symbolic objects in the abdomen, the head, or the hands. The shells in the abdominal cavity stand for the sea, a metaphoric represen- tation of the other world. They indicate that this is an older figure, for in later examples they are replaced by mirrors and glass. The figure also contains medicines, which were applied together with the pronouncement of a spell. This sculpture is a good example of the Kongo nkisi form. The figure is conceived as a self-contained, compact, columnar object. The head and face express tremendous concentration, particularly the large, staring eyes, common to many nkisi figures. John M. Janzen Reinhild Kauenhoven-Janzen Right: 23. Female figure (teki). Bembe, Congo-Brazzaville. Wood; 56cm (22"). Donated by B. de Blank, Rotterdam, 1887. MWR 3747. This female figure is a fine example of Bembe art. A cloth covers the back of her head. The thick neck is typical, but the absence of tattooing is unusual. The Bembe style is quite distinctive. Every detail of the human body has a specific meaning for the sculptor. Ladislas Segy (1958:27) writes, "Angularity and roundness are the recurrent motifs of African art." Bertil Soderberg Opposite page: 24 &amp; 25. Figures by Emile Gbeli, C6te d'lvoire. Wood, enamel paint; 160cm (63") and 154cm (60.6"). Acquired from Africa Exclusive, Delft, 1994. MWR 72371 and 72370. Left: These sculptures show a surprising, even shocking, development in African portrait art, but this does not mean that they break with tradition. Gbeli works with photographs of nudes of African and Afro-American women to create images reflecting the Lagoon peoples' traditional ideals of strength and beauty. Although revolutionary in terms of their realism, they are based on old Bete concepts of the role of sculpture in the community. Both the older "people of wood" and Gbeli's figures may be meant as portraits. Diviners traditionally use carved figures embodying masculine and feminine beauty to communicate with the ancestors during healing rituals. Amulets and the representation of clothing allude to the owner. In addition, the image is the representation of the ancestors as well as a substitute for the diviner. The exact function of Gbeli's sculptures is often difficult to determine, for the artist may carve identical works for both sacred and profane purposes; in the latter case the figures may serve as decorations at parties or as salon pieces. Erna Beumers Right: When I saw this woman for the first time, I stopped and stared. She seemed to look back at me, completely exposed and yet totally assured of her own dignity. The exquisitely carved form made me think of a Greek sculpture. At the same time, because of the choice of the material-wood- ages of African tradition seemed to echo in the figure. She stands without a plinth or pedestal, with her feet on the ground-really like a human being. This enhances the idea of poise and self-confidence that radiates from this embodiment of perfect beauty.

The nails which cover this figure bear witness to the actions of the ritual spe- cialist, who asks Nkonde to punish people by making them fall ill or even killing them. The body of the wooden figure is painted black with white dots. The white stripes on the face intensify its awesome character. The hat is intact. The pupils are clearly discernible in the glass inlay in the eyes. The tip of the tongue protrudes from the mouth, as is often the case with Mayombe sculptures. A bag that is bound around the neck and a contain- er in the navel area contain magical medicines. Joseph A. Cornet Right: 27. Power figure (nkisi). Loango coast, Congo-Brazzaville. Wood, metal, fibers, raffia cloth, cane, pigment; 71cm (28"). Originally (1884-86) in J. Besfelau's collection; donated by the Nederlandsche Zendings Vereeniging, Rotterdam, 1894. MWR 4795. The term nkisi designates a variety of ritual objects in western equatorial Africa. It refers to spirits in nature as well as spirits of the dead. Nkisifigures are made by an artist for an individual client, usually a magician-healer, for use in the treatment of sickness, for protection, or for a novice's initiation into a ritual order common to the nkisi. They are ritually treated to achieve a particular end and are sometimes combined with other objects. Nails or wedges driven into the wooden figure represent the oaths that "bind" the words of the spell. "Injuring" the nkisi, thus provoking it, compels it to act in the desired manner. Since the carver does not directly deal with the eventual user, nkisi fig- ures tend to reflect the general aesthetic canons of region and culture rather than specific use. This figure, the name and particular purpose of which are unknown, reflects Loango coast features. The dominant head, character- ized by strong curves of eyebrows, eyes, nose, lips, and domed top, con- trasts with the amorphous surface of the rest of the figure, marked by the evidence of years of use.

Acquired from G. Chesi, Austria, 1994. MWR 72035. Girls who serve as attendants at an Egou shrine are called Ananasi(Egoussi in Togo). Their skin is covered with red paint. Egou is the god of iron and therefore also the god of car drivers. He is held responsible for all accidents involving cars and other metal objects. In order to appease him, one offers blood or red palm oil at the shrine. One often finds related gods like Hebiesso (the god of thunder) or Sakpate (the god of smallpox) in shrines consecrated to Egou.

STROTHER' Notes,from page 15 I would particularly like to thank Solomon Hailemariam and Waleta Aregawit for making their healing scrolls available to me; the noted calligraphers and dabtara Meregeta Berhane Abadi and Meregeta Tesfay Gebere Mariam for their inter- pretations of those scrolls; and Joachim Persoon, Raymond A. Silverman, and Marilyn E. Heldman for facilitating a visit to Ethiopia in 1997. 1. For a chilling and clear statement of this philosophy, see Graham 1937. 2. "Ethiopia" here refers not to the present nation-state but to the historically integrated culture of the highlands of Tigray, Wollo, Gondar, and Shoa (p. 39, n. 8). Mercier focuses on Christian scrolls, although he notes that Muslim scrolls exist, usually without images (p. 54, fig. 45). The oldest surviving scroll that he has been able to identify dates from the sixteenth century (p. 41); however, the tradition is undoubtedly much older, as the objects are fragile and subject to iconodasm. 3. This conception of illness no doubt has strong pre- Christian roots, but finds powerful reinforcement in the Gospel accounts of Christ healing, e.g., Mark 5:1-20. 4. Worshippers of zar spirits conceptualize the scrolls quite dif- ferently. In this case, the scroll is made from the skin of an animal 94 sacrificed to a spirit and the case may be sealed with the blood from the sacrifice. In Wello, the scroll is carried as proof of one's wilingness to live in peace with the indwelling zar spirit (p. 106). 5. Mercier concurs with scholars who argue that the term "icon" is inappropriate for Ethiopian paintings, which are conceptual- ized as "signs" not to be confused with the presence of the orig- inal (pp. 75, 79, 85, n. 28, 32). 6. For more extended translations, Mercier refers the reader to Strelcyn (1955). See also Basset (1896) and Gragg (1974) for related texts. Raymond A. Silverman also regretted the absence of a complete transcription in the exhibition itself (1998:81). 7. The original is written in Ge'ez. Conventional English punc- tuation has been added. Readers wishing to compare this text with others should note that no standardized system for tran- scription of Ethiopic languages into the Roman alphabet has yet won wide acceptance (although scholars are now favoring the International Phonetic Alphabet). Consequently, the spelling of words and names can vary considerably from one transcription to the next. In scrolls, one finds the added complexity of writ- ers, with little or no knowledge of Arabic, transliterating Arabic names and words into Ge'ez. Marilyn E. Heldman has observed that this particular scroll demonstrates a "lack of trained scribal handwriting" (personal communication). It is therefore possible that the rendering of Arabic and prayers may be especially idiosyncratic. The scroll measures 1 m 14.5 cm in length; 6.5 cm in width. It has a painting of an archangel with drawn sword at the top. According to his mother, Waleta Aregawit, Solomon would mutter strange words in his sleep as a child, and once he attacked his grandfather (who slept with him) during a night- mare with such energy that the family had to break a window in order to come to the grandfather's aid. They consulted a dab- tara, who was a friend of Solomon's father and distantly relat- ed. This man, who was also a painter who restored paintings in the Church of the Four Beasts in Axum, diagnosed posses- sion by an evil spirit and prescribed a scroll. He told the fami- ly to prepare a red sheep with white on the forehead. Solomon wore the scroll for four years on his left side, under the arm. 8. The first section of the scroll is drawn from the prayer "Solomon's Net," summarized by Mercier (pp. 48-49). King Solomon vanquishes his tormenters by pronouncing "Lofham," one of the Secret Names of God, and forces the King of the Blacksmiths to admit to the evil deeds of his subordinates. See also Euringer 1929. 9. The demons are surprised by Solomon's self-confidence and equanimity. 10. That is, the demons have stolen away memory and self- consciousness so that their victims only remember half of what they should know. 11. Some of the letters of the words in the boxed section are written upside down to stress their power. The design marking off the top of the box is made to look like Arabic cursive script. 12. The text continues: Gilalo Gilalo Gilalo Gil- alo Tomola Tomola Tomola Tomola Tomola Tomola Tomola Tylo Tylo Tylo Tylo Tylo Tylo Tylo Tylo Tylo Bezufan, Bezufan, Bezufan, Bezufan, Bezufan Bezu- fan, Bezufan, Bezufan, Bezufan.

Meregeta Tesfay Gebere Mariam defines "Gargari" as a zar spirit that drives individuals to quarrel with everyone around them. Meregeta Berhane Abadi defines it as a kind of restlessness caused by spirit possession that disturbs the vic- tim so that he cannot concentrate and picks fights with his friends and family. Meregeta Tesfay classes "inabaria" or "einabaria" as epilepsy, whereas Meregeta Berhane says that it should be "eyenetabaria," uncivilized behavior (lit. acting like a "baria" or pagan from the south of Ethiopia). Literally, "eyenetabaria" signifies "eye of the slave." He describes it as a pernicious disease, difficult to treat, whose symptoms look a great deal like HIV. Dedenework is the name of a spirit that usually attacks women and "marries" them so that they resist taking a human husband. 14. Meregeta Tesfay explains that when Christ was ministering to Jerusalem, the apostles were baffled by a huge woman with red-gold eyes who killed whomever she gazed upon, especial- ly children. When they appealed to Christ, he explained that she awaited the Last Judgment, but he confided to them a series of prayers with the power to shrivel her up so that she would split into dust like dry wood. These prayers are pre- served in the book Hasure Meskel, another major source for the text of scrolls and a precious possession for calligraphers. 15. "Eyenet" is shyness; "eyenetela," shyness so debilitating that it prevents the victim from achieving his or her goals. "Eyenorg" is a spirit that works by the evil eye, probably the name of the demon described above. 16. The text continues: [As you promised in the covenantl saying: veqir veqir beforikem ater gowan chilwaq hadu waeaniusana- ous tenyaopo ishe- shu uedetlakevu elec- osterelabout eleour- zourha elewaleta work [Tear}. 17. To give an example, Waleta Aregawit suffered repeated miscarriages during the first five to six years of her marriage. The family strongly suspected a certain dabtara of causing the problem through the "evil eye." Instead of confronting him, her grandfather spoke to him diplomatically and suggested that he prepare a scroll for her. This strategy is also a regular one in many parts of West and Central Africa.

One of the more bizarre twists to the H-AfrArts chat noted in this article was a developing contest over exactly who the hell Ofili was ethnically (an important subject anywhere, but truly critical in Nigerian discourse). The storm was raised by Ikem S. Okoye: "Now, I've known many Ofili's in my life. They were all ethnically Igbo. Ofili IS an Igbo name, and quite common among Anioma [e.g., Western] Igbo." Having thrown one bombshell, Okoye then lobs another: "Since he got much involved in the Ofili fracas...this might be a moment to mention that Olu Oguibe's very Yoruba-sounding name is in fact Igbo...Oguibe in Igbo refers to the tragedy of warfare amongst brethren....The name literally means 'battle amongst kin.' I've always thought, given Oguibe's admirable artistic and art historical stance, that his name was suitably globalist (I wager that most people think he's ethnically Yoruba)!" (Nov. 5, 1999). Okoye's outing of both Ofili and Oguibe as closet Igbos led to an increasingly arcane cybersquabble between various Kwa-language-speaking scholars that surely would have left Mr. Ofili cold. Check additional correspon- dence in H-AfrArts for documentation undoubtedly leading to somebody's future dissertation, "On Ethnic Identification among Southern Nigerian Artists and Scholars." 2.

There were others on the chat line who joined Ms. Acholonu in her sentiments. Claire L. Dehon: "I do long for the days when Art was supposed to elevate the mind! What Ofili has done, like many so-called artists, is to put things together and confuse that amalgam with artistic creation. Sure it is done to shock the Bourgeois, and Bourgeois love spending money for those things. As long as it works, Ofili and other artistic char- latans will thrive" (Oct. 11, 1999). P Idahose concurred in a weird Weskos-inflected invective: "...while so many [of] our colleagues have run around looking for the original source the ethnographic field of the essential totemic dung use. Ofili dun dung us all, ooh. Shock value in the age of bourgeois victory is about as radical as MTV....In today's world, Ofili proves noth- ing matters anymore" (Oct. 13, 1999). 4. One might profitably compare Ofili's assemblages with the Fon bocio (Blier 1995) and the "mojo boards" of Pierrot Barra (Cosentino 1998). In all these cases, the style of assemblage is derived from deep religious and aesthetic principles in African- Atlantic cultures. 5. See for instance Peter Schjeldahl (1999:104): "Ofili's light- ning rod canvas is gorgeous, sweet, and respectful of its sub- ject, rendering her as a sternly hieratic African personage in petal-like blue robes. Ofili is a large-spirited artist who comes to praise, period." 6. Who says that the divine face may not indeed be a terrible thing to behold? It certainly was for Amos Tutuola, who expressed a Yoruba tropism for the surreal which swallows visual traditions (think of the Austro-Nigerian idiom devel- oped by Twin Seven Seven and other masters of the Oshogbo spring 2000 * african arts contributors a r t i c I e s PETER ABSPOEL was a student of cultural anthropology and is presently a freelance author, translator, and editor.
