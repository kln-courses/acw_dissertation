<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Part 1 Narrative and Rhetorical Perspectives The application of rhetorical and narrative approaches to science have been used  to analyze the discourse of popular culture and how it relates to complex social  phenomena such as the proliferation of pseudoscience or antipsychiatry. The rhet- oric of science studies how scientists — as part of a discursive community — frame  and communicate their knowledge; what they argue about and how; how sci- entists present their findings; and what genres, formats, and media they use to  communicate those findings. Despite the growing body of scholarship on the  rhetoric of science, there is a need for further development of rhetoric as a frame- work for the public understanding of science, specifically given the increasingly  mediatized public debate in an expert-dominated society. A rhetorical approach  to scientific discourse studies how particular framings of scientific findings and  developments influence the socio-ethical debate, how this relates to science pol- icy, and how an awareness of the rhetorical dimensions of science is important for  scientific as well as nonscientific audiences and what the educational dimensions  are of such a rhetorical and narrative awareness. In part 1, this volume brings together new work on the public understand- ing of science from the perspective of literature, narratology, cultural studies,  anthropology, and rhetoric. </page> <page sequence="2">  </page> <page sequence="3"> Chapter 1 Experiencing Nature through Cable Television David J. Tietge Abstract This chapter discusses the relationship between cable television repre- sentations of nature and biology and the influence they wield over public  understanding of environmental networks. The metaphors, delivery, content,  and orientation of such programming are driven by what Kenneth Burke  calls an “occupational psychosis,” a collective orientation that mirrors the  economic principles of the culture in which such “edutainment” has been  produced. More specifically, the author is interested in how cable nature pro- gramming leaves us with nature entertainment as a product — a distinctly  commercialized thing to be consumed, a franchise to be capitalized on and  expanded. Just as Disney did before them, the anthropocentric nature pro- grams discussed in this essay reflect an ideal that giving the audience what  it wants — by tapping into the ideological orientations like war, conflict,  and competition they already possess — is more profitable than representing  nature from the stodgy seat of orthodox biological science. Moreover, the  chapter addresses the outcomes of representing nature as a product and how  this affects public attitudes about nature and the environment. The nature documentary, as a genre, has a long mass media history and has taken on  a range of forms, from the anthropomorphized Disney wildlife film shorts of the  of the mid-twentieth century to the twenty-first century cable animal serials that  represent what I like to call the “Savannah Gladiatorial Games.” In between, there  3 </page> <page sequence="4"> 4 Part 1 • Chapter 1 are many subgenres, each with its own signature and each employing some greater  or lesser degree of scientific authority, depending on the intended audience and  purpose of the program. Consequently, each generic form conveys a particular set  of rhetorical messages, some more exacting in the rigors of production than others,  but all geared toward an attempt to bring us closer to nature in some vicarious way.  In our high-tech, largely urban and suburban culture, the natural world is seen as  something remote and uncommon, and this sense of remoteness contributes to the  public’s inability to understand nature in terms that aren’t corrupted by this orien- tation. While some nature documentaries try very hard to act as a corrective to this  alienation from nature, others perpetuate the myth that nature is ours to conquer,  control, and transform into a human image. Yet other programs seem orchestrated  strictly for their entertainment value, a kind of reality TV for the wilderness, while  still others are written for political, scientific, or educational purposes. All such pro- grams carry ideological assumptions that, when critically unpacked, reveal some very  important motives and objectives on the part of the producers, directors, and play- ers in these natural dramas, and provide a fascinating cross section of the American  mind-set concerning the natural world and our relationship to it. While there are seemingly countless cable programs dedicated to animals,  there are just as many dedicated to natural phenomena like severe weather and  natural disasters. One show, Whale Wars, is less about whales per se, and more  about the personalities of the ecological soldiers who protect them from the rav- ages of whale poaching. The Deadliest Catch, likewise, tells us virtually nothing  about the Alaskan king crab or its behavior (except that it is a difficult species  to fish for) but all about the dangers to humans while fishing for them in the  Bering Sea under extremely cold and hazardous weather conditions. In both  of these shows, the focus is on the drama among the humans — not the animal  that has gathered them together towards a common goal. The narrative revolves  around such questions as: Will the new deck hand work out? Should we board  the whaler or merely try to scare the ship off? Will we reach the catch quota and  make a profit? There are other programs that focus on the human theatrics of  being in an unfortunate “natural” situation, be it severe weather, an inhospitable  environment, or a confrontation with wild animals. This category of programs is  one that is not strictly anthropomorphic (assigning to nature human attributes),  but anthropocentric, that is, centers on human individual and social troubles in  wild environments or under extreme conditions and, most significantly, maps  our behaviors and expectations onto natural contexts. To help theoretically frame this idea of how we receive representations of  nature relates to how we, as members of a capitalistic, technological society, tend  </page> <page sequence="5"> Experiencing Nature through Cable Television 5 to also frame the world within terms that reflect the interests of production  and consumption. In Permanence and Change, Kenneth Burke borrows John  Dewey’s notion of “occupational psychosis” to explain this concept, noting that  “the term corresponds to the Marxian doctrine that a society’s environment in  the historical sense is synonymous with the society’s methods of production”  (38). In its most primitive form, occupational psychosis reveals itself through a  preoccupation with the main source of food for a self-contained group (Burke  uses the example of “tribes”), such that this form of sustenance manifests itself  symbolically and conceptually in everything the tribe does. If fish are a staple  for a given tribe, fish and fishing become a major — even central — topic of con- cern running through the culture: art, religion, music, dress, and so on. In more  developed civilizations, the occupational psychosis becomes more complex and  abstracted, such that members of society are often unaware of the origins of their  worldview, despite the fact that they voice that worldview symbolically through  their language all the time. If wealth, technology, and ownership are central to  our economy, we will routinely express ourselves in terms that reflect these inter- ests, including in our choice of entertainment. Therefore, it is theoretically important for this essay to notice how the two  most dominating American orientations of science and capitalism are philo- sophically couched in a common assumption about the materiality of the world;  both are concerned with the physical, objective “reality” of human existence, and  therefore, how nature can be understood and manipulated for physical ends.  Nature programming, then, must submit to certain epistemological “truths”  that shape how such knowledge is presented in a media venue tethered to an  economic imperative that forces nature programming into generic categories for  prescribed viewers. Such attitudes have political and educational ramifications  for how the general public perceives debates that concern the natural world, how  we understand the science behind these debates, and the policies we make to  address our most pressing environmental problems. With the increasing popularity of so-called reality TV in the last decade  or more, we can expect that most educationally oriented cable stations like  Discovery, The Learning Channel, NatGeo, the Science Channel, and oth- ers would have to submit to the demographics that drive cable ratings for all  channels. America’s occupational psychosis determines the framing of the con- tent for these education channels, which have been pressured to conform to an  “edutainment” format that meets the needs and preferences of today’s television  viewer. The nature shows that air regularly on these stations reflect a confor- mity to “intense,” “extreme,” and “ultimate” themes, identifying superlative  </page> <page sequence="6"> 6 Part 1 • Chapter 1 characteristics in animals, environments, weather, or natural disasters that pro- vide the dramatic backdrop for the program’s content. A rather curious example  of this kind of framing is a program shown on the History Channel called  Serial Killer Earth, which is a clear case of an anthropocentric structure pitting  humans against nature in a kind of planetary dragnet, such that it represents  an anthropomorphizing of the earth itself and all the forces it can summon  for human destruction. We need only look at the show’s title to see that calling  the earth a “serial killer” is bizarrely inappropriate, but is deliberately geared to  attracting an audience segment increasingly obsessed with murderers, serial kill- ers, and other social deviants. Strangely, this trend in cable formatting indicates  a regression to some of America’s earliest attitudes about nature, a time when  the first American settlers from Europe saw the frontier as uninviting, hostile,  dangerous, and even freakish. A quick glance at the episode titles and descriptions bears this out further.  The episode “Death by Dust Storm” features “apocalyptic dust storms” that “suf- focate cities around the globe”; it also features “a tornado chasing a family, nearly  crushing them with their truck” and further mayhem as “Mother Nature con- tinues to wreak havoc,” as though she were a criminal still at large. In “Mudslide  Massacre,” a twister “targets” a truck driver in Oklahoma and a volcano “smoth- ers” Indonesian citizens. The verbs used to describe these natural occurrences  assign willful actions and motivated intent, but it is difficult to tell just how  metaphorically the audience is supposed to take such narrative accounts. Even  if viewers see the language only as a metaphorical shorthand, such a framing  device elicits a sense of victimhood and helplessness at the hands of a sentient  force, thus distorting the true unpredictability of climactic and geological events.  While scientists look to climate change as one factor in more frequently severe  weather, the cessation of global greenhouse emissions and other environmen- tal measures will never eradicate catastrophic storms, tornados, or earthquakes  entirely. The negative personification of physical phenomena promotes an odd  association with the natural world as something to be feared and ultimately as  something that cannot be stopped. Perhaps the strangest episode title is “When  Lakes Attack,” conjuring images of lakes becoming animated through a super- natural transformation and striking out against enemy humans in some Lord of  the Rings epic. The idea that we are at war with nature is implied in “Tornado  vs. Airport,” as though there has been a deliberate battle arranged to determine  a conclusive victor between these two “combatants.” The notion that the earth  is conscious — and malevolent — seems misplaced in the twenty-first century,  </page> <page sequence="7"> Experiencing Nature through Cable Television 7 harkening back to a time when superstition about natural forces ruled human  attitudes about its relationship to us. But of course the most basic aim of such  tactics is to increase ratings by attempting to quench American entertainment  bloodlust and our fixation on all things violent and “extreme.” From a produc- tion and time slot perspective, shows like Serial Killer Earth must compete  with other cable programming that adopts the same base attitude about what  it is we want in our entertainment, so nature is transformed into an entity of  ruthless evil. In a word, such programming becomes simple product, packaged  to conform to the collective associations triggered by our culture of nationalism,  ownership, law and order, and war. The themes of attack, war, and battle reveal the colonial side of our occu- pational psychosis: Americans’ tendency to think in militaristic metaphors.  We have wars on everything — drugs, crime, women, poverty, Christmas, even  God — and cable TV nature documentarians seem to be tapping into this cul- tural orientation. Some TV documentaries, such as NatGeo Wild’s Caught in  the Act, are reminiscent of gladiatorial games. The animals are usually exotic  (giraffes, hippos, tigers, lions, rhinos) and large, pitted against one another in  incongruous ways (a giraffe attacking a rhino, for example). Crossing the generic  boundary between nature documentary and high-contact, extreme sports, there  is an ancient Roman quality to the spectacle, with its focus on the exotic, the  spectacular, and the violent. We are a society that loves to see a fight, and what  could be more exhilarating than witnessing two large, wild animals go after one  another? Showcased in these episodes are themes like “Clash of the Cheetahs,”  “Elephant Battleground,” “Wild Dog Attack,” and “Cannibal Octopus.” Most  of the footage is provided by amateur photographers who serendipitously hap- pened to be in a prime spot to capture an unusual shot, but often it is of poor  quality and compensated for by jerky, quick-cut editing and supplemental foot- age spliced in. Most episodes are not overly sensationalized, however, and many  of the situations that have been “caught” on film are truly unusual or unexpected,  like the video of a pride of lions attacking an adult mother hippo and, eventually,  its calf (there is another example where a “coalition” of three cheetahs perform a  similar assault on a wildebeest). It is uncomfortable to watch, and the narrative  accompanying the video is supplied almost entirely by the person shooting the  footage (in this case an amateur naturalist photographer living in South Africa)  and generally avoids the temptation to moralize. For this series, then, there is an  incongruity between interpretive vantage points. Whereas the photographer’s  narration stresses how unusual just such a spectacle is (lions normally do not  </page> <page sequence="8"> 8 Part 1 • Chapter 1 attack full-grown hippos) and how surprised he was to have been able to capture  it on film, the production mantra for the whole series, according to its website, is  that it “teaches us that nature doesn’t always play by the rules.” Or consider the footage of a lion attacking a mongoose, a creature perhaps  one-fiftieth the size of the lion. The mongoose, caught helplessly in the claws of  the lion (which appears to be playing with it more than attempting to eat it),  fights back viciously in its terror and takes the lion by surprise. When the mon- goose escapes the big cat’s clutch, the smaller animal lunges at it until it finds  an opening and scurries heroically down a tunnel. The narrating photographer  is amazed at the mongoose’s tenacity, and declares that “nature always teaches  me something new.” Amazing as the footage is, again the lesson is consistent  with the defining rule of survival — in this case, which was more threatened and  which had the most to lose. This should not strike one as particularly “new.”  For the lion, the mongoose was little more than a morsel, and its casual toy- ing with the small creature indicated its lack of commitment to such a modest  meal, as it could have crushed it with its jaws or ripped it open with its claws any  time it wanted. For the mongoose, it was a mortal battle for its own existence,  and it unleashed a fury borne of the desperation to save its own life. While it  is indeed surprising that it escaped, the evolutionary law of the jungle remains  unbroken — survive any way you can. Assigning such rules to the wild is one way of engaging our occupational  psychosis, since it reflects our desire to superimpose moral order onto a system  that is intrinsically amoral. Steven Jay Gould, in an essay called “Nonmoral  Nature,” argues that this is a conceptual mistake, since it reflects more about our  need to impose ethical meaning onto nature than it does any scientific reality  about how nature actually operates (60). But still other popular nature programs  of note highlight the preoccupation with warlike scenarios and life-threatening  situations. NatGeo airs a program called Dangerous Encounters, where herpetol- ogist (reptile specialist) Dr. Brady Barr locks horns with dangerous wild animals  like crocodiles, snakes, wild boars, and sharks. Animal Planet features shows  like I Shouldn’t Be Alive, a survivalist drama whereby the ordeals of people who  have survived natural horrors are interviewed and their stories are recreated, and  Swamp Wars, in which, according to Animal Planet’s website, “Miami-Dade Fire  Rescue Venom One battles the alligators, constrictors, and other lethal animals  that threaten South Florida.” The Discovery Channel airs programs like Man  vs. Wild, another survivalist show with host “Bear” Grylls going “face to face  with the grueling task of navigating remote locations, sharing invaluable survival  </page> <page sequence="9"> Experiencing Nature through Cable Television 9 strategies along the way.” The Science Channel runs Monster Bug Wars to empha- size the brutality of the insect world, where “a host of ruthless bugs as bizarre as  they are lethal slug it out in real-life battles to the death. Witness epic encounters  between swarms of marauding assassins, and vicious one-on-one clashes where  only one bug survives.” While such portrayals may make a certain practical sense if cable markets  are competing for viewers, it also marks a symptom of social malaise about our  collective condition. There is a disturbing pessimism running through our cul- ture that seems to embrace the dark and the unpleasant, at least when it comes  to our choice of visual distractions, as is evidenced by the sheer number of horror  movies, violent action movies, violent thrillers, and war movies released in any  given year. To map this collective fetish onto nature programs seems odd, to say  the least, but perhaps the most important question is, what does it do to public  perception about nature when it is portrayed as a battleground, or on a more per- sonal level, a sentient fiend bent on human destruction? As a symptom of limited  scientific literacy and misinformation about scientific discoveries, it appears that  programs like Serial Killer Earth and Swamp Wars are exacerbating an already  perilous condition by treating the human-nature relationship as a warlike strug- gle for dominance instead of as a reciprocation, a kind of symbiosis between  human and environment that contributes to the health of both. On a primal  level, it is not hard to understand this attitude, since harsh environmental con- ditions, unpredictable climate, and violent natural forces have always been part  of the challenge to our survival, harkening back to a more ancient occupational  psychosis. (It is little wonder that, extending from this, primitive and modern  religions alike have attributed to natural disasters a sign of a god’s displeasure  or a manifestation of God’s will.) But what the more militaristic man versus  nature metaphor suggests is a rationalization for our control over nature, not a  capitulation to the gods or a recognition that these powerful forces are part of  our natural condition, not a separation from it. In typical American binary fash- ion, our relationship with nature — with the earth — is a battle that must have  two sides, a front, and an objective. This is neither a superstitious attitude nor a  strictly rational one, but it has an internal logic given the assumptions implicit in  the militaristic framework that contains the relevant anaologies (we fight to win,  there is a good guy and an evil enemy, there is a threat that must be preempted,  we must summon our technology, victory equals dominance). Perhaps one of the main reasons such representations have potentially  hazardous outcomes is linguistic, that is, pertaining to aspects of our language  </page> <page sequence="10"> 10 Part 1 • Chapter 1 system in which we have lost the capacity to distinguish from the purely literal;  hence we mistake the metaphor for the thing itself. According to Chris Hedges,  author of Empire of Illusion, We are a culture that has been denied, or has passively given up, the linguistic  and intellectual tools to cope with complexity, to separate illusion from real- ity. We have traded the printed word for the gleaming image. Public rhetoric  is designed to be comprehensible to a ten-year-old child or an adult with a  sixth-grade reading level. Most of us speak at this level, are entertained and  think at this level. (44) Hedges’s statement may help explain why the producers of cable television nature  shows have opted to portray natural phenomena in such a blatantly uneven  and reductionistic way. By conflating everything to resemble some familiar  type — celebrities or infamous criminals, for example — modern mass media has  eschewed complexity of thought in favor of something everyone can “relate to.”  This becomes a problem for functional (not to mention scientific) literacy, which  Hedges documents as being in serious trouble in the US. According to his esti- mates, nearly one-third of the US is illiterate or barely literate (unable to read  above a fifth-grade level). Hedges explains that “the culture of illusion thrives by  robbing us of the intellectual and linguistic tools to separate illusion from truth. It  reduces us to the level and dependency of children. It impoverishes language” (45).  Our linguistic and rhetorical deprivation has transformed the American citizen  into someone who is engaged only by something familiar or something that can be  easily and consistently mapped onto a personal belief system in some literal way. If  the sophistication of literacy necessary for critical thought has been compromised  or systematically stunted in the way Hedges claims, the problem is ultimately a  failure of education in the face of overwhelming media mediocrity, and it explains  why so many people make decisions that are against their own best interests and  apply these same bankrupt decision-making patterns onto their choice of enter- tainment and their attitudes about nature. It also explains why edutainment  options are so exasperatingly limited. If a program doesn’t resemble other recog- nizable formats very closely, it will not get watched because that would require a  rhetorical acumen that simply doesn’t exist for the average American. If nature is  not framed as a competition, a war, a crime, or a pugilistic conflict, chances are (so  the logic goes) that cable programs dedicated to nature themes will fail. A linguistic inadequacy as severe as Hedges describes makes producing any  television program a simple matter of plugging certain details into a boilerplate  </page> <page sequence="11"> Experiencing Nature through Cable Television 11 formula, but even the details are remarkably alike. That people can watch bland,  indistinct programming episode after episode means that, in Hedges’ words, “we  become trapped in the linguistic prison of incessant repetition” (49), and this rep- etition is seen at every site of the mainstream media, whether in programming,  advertising, news, or sports. For those who care to diverge from such generic cat- egories and view something on one of the “education” channels, they will often  find only a difference in content, not presentation. Personalizing nature and its  forces is like getting to know the “characters” on a reality TV show — characters  who are also blandly generic. We have an opportunity to “take sides” and pass  judgment on humans, animals, and nature all at once. Scientific fact, logical  coherence, and critical literacy become the casualties under such conditions,  because there is no opportunity (or need) to employ them. Paraded before the viewer in the battlefield nature narratives I’ve been dis- cussing is the string of experts, some of whom are genuine, others a bit more  dubious. This is of course intended to lend the narratives credibility, but the way  expertise is employed by the producers often feels perfunctory. If the narrative  involves a tornado in a program like Serial Killer Earth, the show may inter- view a meteorologist who gives us general information about tornadoes — how  powerful they are, how unpredictable they are, what conditions are necessary  for tornadoes to form, the kind of damage they can cause, and so on — but  such experts rarely comment on the content of the central narrative that is the  main part of the show. They are there for lexical reference only, and they func- tion as the arbiters of trivia about the phenomenon du jour. The inclusion of  such experts actually contributes to the illusion instead of providing a skepti- cal counterdiscourse for the framing of the narrative. Credentials for experts  are often not mentioned or suspiciously vague, but in a culture that thrives on  the illusion media manufactures for us, in a narcissistic need to see ourselves in  everything we digest, all opinions become equally valid as long as they match  our own expectations. Hedges notes: “When opinions cannot be distinguished  from facts, when there is no universal standard to determine truth in law, in sci- ence, in scholarship, or in reporting the events of the day, when the most valued  skill is the ability to entertain, the world becomes a place where lies become true,  where people can believe what they want to believe” (51). Experts, under these  conditions, become mere window dressing for the legitimacy of the narrative, no  matter how sensationalized, exaggerated, or otherwise distorted, to create the  militant tone necessary for our “war with nature.” While it is not my intent to condemn these programs as blatant propagators  of out-and-out lies that contribute to the eradication of an enemy called nature,  </page> <page sequence="12"> 12 Part 1 • Chapter 1 there is a deception taking place in these narratives about the dangers we actually  face and the causes behind them. One effect of the incessant repetition mentioned  earlier is that we are caught in the illusion that the world is far more hazardous to  us than it really is. The large number of programs, movies, and TV series show- casing serial killers may lead one to believe that serial killers are lurking around  every corner; likewise, the number of programs detailing the catastrophic expe- riences of those caught in violent natural maelstroms may make us want to avoid  going outside. There is also a solipsism in the idea that natural events are staged  against humans for human entertainment, as if natural phenomena auditioned  for the title of “most extreme” in order to satisfy the viewer’s voyeurism in watch- ing people tormented by bad situations. When entertainment and education  are conflated, the result can be the pervasive dissemination of bad impressions  created by distorted information that may do more harm than good if people  cannot distinguish those aspects which are sensationalized for entertainment  effect from those that are intended to be instructional. Compounding this  distortion further is the ever-increasing reliance on special effects and CGI tech- niques to augment those components of a program that are more cumbersome  (or impossible) to reconstruct using more traditional filmic methods. Media and  cultural studies scholar Phil Bagust observes that the “nature documentary as a  ‘screen genre’ and an ‘industry sector’ has begun to respond to commercial pres- sures to entertain a youthful, special-effects literate, computer-game playing and  blog-empowered audience that has been socialized in a globalized world of rich,  spectacular, kinetic, and often violent ‘virtual geographies’ ” (213). Special effects are so prevalent in all programming these days that one  should not infer that they are reserved only for cable nature programs, but they  do have a unique effect when applied to this genre. Special effects are as old as the  camera itself and have frequently been employed in documentaries going back to  the earliest moving pictures. The camera, however, has always been touted as an  instrument of science, and as such, photography has enjoyed a privileged recep- tion when it comes to its apparent realism in depicting the objects under its gaze  (215). “A picture is worth a thousand words” and “the camera does not lie” are  truisms that reveal our faith in the realistic purity of photographic reproduction.  The visualization of subjects through a photographic medium has always cre- ated an illusion of intimacy with the subject matter because as a species we favor  vision over all the other senses. One need only recall the story of one of the first  cinematic displays at a theater, a very short film involving a perspective shot of a  train heading straight toward the audience. As the story goes, some members of  the audience were so convinced of its realism that they dove out of their seats or  </page> <page sequence="13"> Experiencing Nature through Cable Television 13 bolted for the exit in order to avoid being hit by the photographic image! This  reaction does seem odd to us today, as we are so accustomed to the virtual win- dows of the theater or the ubiquitous television and computer monitor that we  would never panic at the false impression of a cinematic train, but it does speak  to the power of photographic media to summon such “magic.” And the realism  of early photography was cartoonish by today’s standards — the grainy, black and  white film used back then hardly even registers with us as photography today,  yet we indulge in our own illusions, seeking that which we perceive as more and  more “realistic.” The realism we recognize, however, is of an unusual order. CGI  is used so much in film and television that we have confused its sleek, glossy fin- ish with how we experience the world with our own senses. The “realism” can  actually be attributed to the computer enhancement of colors, shapes, depth, and  motion that we would never feel when making physical, sensual contact with  the actual world around us. The use of color enhancement techniques is espe- cially deceptive; the colors we see on high-definition televisions or computers,  for example, are actually far more vivid than what we would see if we were view- ing the subject directly. Our eyes register the colors of a computer interpretation  of its target image, colors we mistake for the ones actually being recorded. The  effect is a sense of reality that is more intense than the visual reality we experi- ence when viewing the world. To complicate matters further, there has been what Bagust calls a “blurring  of boundaries” in contemporary television documentaries that creates a tension  between the assumed objectivity of the documentaries and the need to acknowl- edge the viewing preferences of an audience that seeks to be entertained. As he  puts it, “with the arrival of new economic imperatives and new digital technol- ogies of representation, not only have the barriers between ‘objective recording’  and ‘popular entertainment’ collapsed but so has ‘the fixity of the relationship  between signified and signifier supposed by realism’ ” (217). That is, the relation- ship between the subject being recorded and the person doing the recording is  no longer distinct (we see this in so-called gonzo or POV techniques), as was  the case with more traditional assumptions regarding the faithful and unstained  reproduction of reality, and the audience is perhaps only vaguely aware of this  new dynamic. One of the questions that necessarily arises from this shift is  what is the threshold between fact and fiction whereby a program can still be  considered a documentary? While the events in Serial Killer Earth are based  on personal histories, they are dramatized to a degree where strict journalistic  facts become far more pliable — and questionable. How should the audience  determine which aspect of the portrayal should be taken as factual, which are  </page> <page sequence="14"> 14 Part 1 • Chapter 1 embellished or dramatized, and which are hypothetical or even fictional? The  degree to which audiences today are able to negotiate these differences is hard  to say. Sociologists have one measure, whereas television producers, though per- haps relying on certain sociological determiners, tend to run by strict numbers  and stats. Who watches a program and how often is far more important in the  for-profit sector of cable television than whether or not the message being sent is  properly interpreted. The effect is similar among nature programs that rely heavily on a polished  presentation over more substantial content, and this includes all of the shows  mentioned here. The generic categories of nature program and reality TV, I have  suggested, are becoming increasingly blurred. According to Daniel Beck et al.,  this blurring has occurred with documentaries generally, and we can trace a  history of its development by looking at programs like Candid Camera, which  was one of the first reality TV programs — in fact, one of the first TV programs,  period, first airing in 1948 — that modeled an attempt to bring “real” situations  to life using “ordinary” people (9). From this early example, we are already wit- nessing an overlapping of television fact and fiction through a contrived situation  designed to get a pseudo-sociological response. Beck breaks these genres down  further by tracing other television categories that have historically been either  fact based or fiction based, whereas others like crime shows, talent shows, game  shows, and documentaries “are seen as a mix of authentic and fictional elements”  (17). One of the complications that results when this mix appears in nature pro- grams is that “the viewers have to negotiate the paradoxes and contradictions  inherent in the genre and to reconcile the tension between what is subjectively  real and fictional” (17). The effect may in fact be more acute for nature program- ming because the situations, places, and wildlife are often alien to our usual  understanding of the natural world. In a typical reality TV show we have some  common point of reference: we cook, we have friends, we use products, we are  familiar with stores and may even run our own; but we are not so accustomed  to camping in a rain forest teeming with hazardous or even deadly life. We are  not in the habit of being caught in an earthquake or run out of our homes by  a volcano. Again one might conclude that the intent of presenting “reality” is  seriously compromised by these factors, the unintended consequence being that  the audience has a warped sense of the significance of geographical spaces and  events, or of foreign habitats or the species within them, or of our interconnec- tivity to them. Man vs. Wild, for example, is a survivalist’s fantasy that taps into the  American vision of masculinist values: the lone man in a hostile environment,  </page> <page sequence="15"> Experiencing Nature through Cable Television 15 carrying with him only the barest of necessities to combat the malicious elements,  the harsh landscape, and the lack of food and water. Sometimes Bear Grylls does  not even have a source of fire, or must eat anything containing protein — insect  larvae, chick embryos from partially incubated birds’ eggs, beetles, raw fish or  crustaceans, worms — or he must recycle his own urine in order to keep from  dying of thirst. The reality of his peril is of course considerably lessoned if we  consider that he is obviously not alone, and it is unlikely that his camera crew  or support staff are enduring the same hardships as he is, providing him with  a convenient safety net. The conditions he is describing are “real” enough as far  as the physical and biological science of it are concerned, but they are staged to  demonstrate a particular survival strategy and therefore more closely reproduce  boot camp than any situation most of us (or he) will ever accidentally encounter.  Shock value seems to be a mainstay for this program, especially when it comes  to what Grylls is “forced” to eat. But he is in no actual danger unless something  goes terribly unrehearsed — like the daredevil’s bane of decades past — defying  the script and man’s will against natural forces. This does in fact happen, as in the 2006 death of Australian Steve Irwin, aka  The Crocodile Hunter. Though the rumors immediately circulated that Irwin  was killed by a croc, he was in fact impaled by a stingray while making the iron- ically titled documentary, Ocean’s Deadliest. Irwin was energetic, flamboyant,  and entertaining, and in many ways blazed the path for personalities like Bear  Grylls to be a popular success. One glance at Irwin’s website is all the evidence we  need to see the conflation of edutainment and commercialism in action. The site  reads like a billboard for a Florida reptile house, and it is difficult at first to find  informational content amid the overwhelming presence of ads for Croc Hunter  products like shirts, toys, books, vacation packages, or DVDs. And Irwin’s case is interesting for other reasons. His website biography  reports that he is a naturalist, a herpetologist, and a conservationist, all indicat- ing that he has formal degrees in the biological sciences. In fact, he does not,  but received his experience with animals by “studying and caring for animals  at his parents’ wildlife park, which is now known as the Australia Zoo” (“Steve  Irwin”). Credentialing for a television celebrity is obviously different than it is  for a scientist or a professor, requiring only practical experience and no formal  study or college education. But unless one actively sought out this information  about Irwin, one might assume that he has the formal education necessary to be  an authority on exotic and dangerous animals. Bear Grylls, likewise, has no for- mal college degree but served in the British Special Air Services, climbed Mount  Everest, has a black belt in karate, and is an “avid” skydiver. In the American mind,  </page> <page sequence="16"> 16 Part 1 • Chapter 1 such a resume eclipses any “book learning” that most professionals would view  as imperative for being considered an expert. In addition to this autodidacticism,  both Irwin and Grylls create personae akin to that of the thrill seeker, not the  scientist, and this resonates with an audience that insists on action over instruc- tion. Also, neither of these men are American, and their accents have a beguiling  effect on their ethos that Americans seem to respond favorably to. Australia has  had a special place in the American heart ever since the 80s Crocodile Dundee  craze, and Brits have always been synonymous with culture in American lore.  Irwin and Grylls personify the rugged man of the wild and the explorer mythos,  intrepid with self-assuredness and that elusive quality assigned to such men, cha- risma. They are performers, first and foremost, manifesting a role that is ideally  suited for the act in which they are appearing, specifically groomed to occupy a  unique cable niche. And such qualities mesh well with the man vs. nature metaphorical frame,  since they are the same qualities we would expect from our best and bravest (if not  brightest). If our relationship with nature is to be portrayed as warlike, the sol- dier persona maintains a certain metaphorical consistency, and Irwin and Grylls,  while not soldiers, certainly do emote the same soldierly ethos through their  daring, their willingness to engage any threat, their mercenary spread to exotic  locations, and their ability to survive the harshest of conditions in fulfillment of  their mission. The fine line between science and sensationalism, between the pur- suit of dangerous animals for biological knowledge and the display of a glorified  circus spectacle, is carefully walked by these performers, and there are elements  of both. Irwin, for example, usually had a reason for meddling with creatures, but  it was not always clear whether it was for research and conservationist purposes  or just for kicks. Grylls’s stated purpose is to illustrate “survival skills,” but again,  for the average viewer, his program taps into a masculinist state-of-nature day- dream far more than it does into any bona fide need to know such things. Again  we see nature entertainment as a product — a distinctly commercialized thing to  be consumed, a franchise to be capitalized on and expanded. Just as Disney did  before them, the anthropocentric nature programs have recognized that giving  the audience what it wants — by tapping into ideological orientations like war  and conflict that they already possess (a distinctive feature of our occupational  psychosis) — is more profitable than representing nature from the perspective of  academic biological science. The programs I have been discussing here represent an educational opportu- nity that has not, unfortunately, been well fulfilled. Because they are so popular,  it is important for the watching public to be vigilant about how they interpret  </page> <page sequence="17"> Experiencing Nature through Cable Television 17 what they are seeing. While I do not think that the American public as a whole is  nearly as naïve about how the media both confirms and influences its attitudes as  some have suggested, I do think that we are witnessing the need for a higher lit- eracy in technologically delivered information systems like contemporary nature  programs. So far, we have been so eager to rush headlong into the “information  age” that we have overlooked the need to decipher the overwhelming amount of  information we can access. “Technological literacy,” as the term is commonly  used, means only the knowledge of how to operate new technology and apply  it; it does not tend to refer to the means by which new information delivery sys- tems repackage information, create facts and factoids, history, data, and indeed  knowledge itself, or how more traditional sources like books and libraries can  greatly supplement click-of-a-mouse information access. As a critical tool nec- essary in the twenty-first century, such “rhetorical literacy” as I am advocating  would include far more instruction on all levels of language structure; close crit- ical readings of popular texts, including cable nature programs; training on how  logical arguments are constructed; utilizing existing knowledge and making new  knowledge; and examining how people, agencies, corporations and other institu- tions all have rhetorical reasons for presenting knowledge in a preordained way. When it comes to nature programming as a technological source of informa- tion, cable programmers and producers could aid in rhetorical literacy as well; they  might, for example, emphasize what role we can play in our own environmental  stability. And while no actions will ever prevent blizzards, hurricanes, earthquakes,  floods, or other natural catastrophes, actions to make our biosphere healthier can  help reduce the frequency of many of our most common disasters while also pro- viding realistic countermeasures to actual threats. They might help us understand  the basics of survival under real circumstances rather than indulge our voyeuristic  tendency to demand shock and awe in our edutainment. I have discussed only a  few of the many programs that cable television now airs and only a few of the meth- ods that are used to construct a subgenre of nature show that represents one slot  in the lineup. These shows, however, reveal something broader about American  priorities because of their popularity and ubiquity, and they may present certain  social, political, and environmental hazards to an uninitiated public.
