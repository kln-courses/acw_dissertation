<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CONCEPT OF DEITY: A Comparative and Historical Study. The Wilde Lectures in Natural and Comparative Religion in the Univer- sity of Oxford. By E. O. JAMES, D.Litt., D.D., Ph.D., F.S.A., Professor of the History and Philosophy of Religion in the University of London, Fellow of University College. Hutchinson's University Library, London. 1950. Pp. xiii, 200. 18s. IN 1917, Professor Pringle-Pattison published his Gifford Lectures under the title of The Idea of God in the Light of Recent Philosophy. They appeared under the shadow of the first World-war. Now, as we still lie under the shadow of a second and more disastrous World-war, Professor James has given us his Wilde Lectures under the almost synonymous title of The Concept of Deity. It is interesting to compare the two books. In his preface Professor Pringle-Pattison claims that the purpose of his book is neither critical nor historical, but constructive throughout, and it has generally been acknowledged that his claim was well justified.</page><page sequence="2">272 Reviews Professor James, in his preface, thus defines his aim and principles of procedure : " Under these changed circumstances the line of demarcation between the approaches to Natural and Revealed Religion has worn so thin that the distinctions formerly drawn are of little more than historic interest, except perhaps in backwaters where earlier modes of thought survive undisturbed. But regarded from the present empirical and historical standpoints, the general principles that govern the idea of revelation as an inductive category clearly fall within the scope of a comparative investigation of ' natural religion'. Therefore, I have not hesitated to consider their implications in the elucidation of the concept of Deity, independent of any attempt to establish a unique supernatural authority for specific traditions or dogmas." While Professor Pringle-Pattison confined his treatment of the subject exclusively to its philosophical implications, Professor James, as an anthropologist and archaeologist of repute, intimately acquainted with all the most recent advances in those fields, has, one might say, taken all knowledge to be his province, and has ranged far and wide from aborig- inal Australians to Alexander and Whitehead. His book is really a history of the part which the concept of a supreme being, or Deity, has played in the development of civilization and in human history. We are at times overwhelmed by an embarras de richesses, non multum sed multa, as the learned author wanders gaily down some by-path of knowledge not immediately relevant to the purpose of the book, as, for example the discussion of the Virgin Birth and Immaculate Conception, neither of which subjects, by the way, is to be found in the index. But the book as a whole is an impressive achievement, and gives a fine panoramic survey of the development of the idea of God and its effect on human history. This is admirably summed up at the end of chapter IV: " So the First and Final Cause of all existence is assigned the highest human attributes-fatherhood, power, wisdom, love and creativity-because they are the dim reflections of the one and only perfect Being in Whom alone all that is divine exists in the completeness of Ultimate Reality and Absolute Value. By looking into himself man has seen and found as it were an image of the Infinite and Eternal, and while he may have inferred that God must possess these same qualities only in a higher degree, beyond this anthropomorphic reasoning lies the further consideration that the highest human attributes are also valid for the right ordering and existence of the world as a cosmos. If this in fact is a divine creation, they must be of the very nature and essence of the Reality in which all things are grounded." In a book of so wide a range it was perhaps inevitable that a few small slips should occur, and if they are mentioned it is not with the object of petty or carping criticism, but in the hope that they may be corrected in a second edition. For instance on p. 107 we find " Mutazalites ", and on p. 186 " Mu'ta- zilites ". On p. 172 the Hebrew equivalent of " seer " is given as kohen. This is not correct; in Hebrew the word kohen only has the meaning " priest ", but in Arabic the parallel root kahin has the meaning</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 273 " diviner " or " seer ". On p. 176 it may be misleading to bracket the Targums with Mishnah and Haggadah. The Targums are the Aramaic translations or paraphrases of the Old Testament which came into existence, at first orally, and later in written form, to meet the needs of synagogue worship at a time when Hebrew had ceased to be the spoken language of the Jewish people. But these things are but spots in the sun, and Professor James has placed the students of comparative religion under an immense debt for this deeply instructive volume on a subject of the greatest importance.
