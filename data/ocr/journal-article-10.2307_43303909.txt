<plain_text><page sequence="1">An Ecocritical Reading of Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels Mohammad Shaaban Ahmad Deyab E ABSTRACT Numerous critics have studied Jonathan Swift's use of animals as satirical tools in Gulliver's Travels. However, none has devoted sufficient attention to Swift's forerunning "ecocritical" concern with animal issues in relation to humans. Although the animal theme in Gulliver's Travels does involve satir- ical intentions, this paper aims at showing that it has more profound impli- cations that manifest Swift's forward-looking ideas regarding the relation between humans and their natural environment, as represented in the hu- man-animal relationship. The ethical stand and moral commitment to the natural world represented by animals, and the care for making the themes of a literary work a means to create connections between man and the nat- ural environment around him, are basic ecocritical values that Swift stresses both explicitly and implicitly throughout the novel. KEYWORDS animal centrism, animal-human relationships, anthropocentricism,, ecocrit- icism, Gulliver's Travels , Jonathan Swift, pet animals, vivisection □ Introduction This article aims at showing how Jonathan Swift's representation of animals in Gulliver's Travels manifests beliefs that in a way presage modern "ecological" ideas. It aims at moving beyond the common satirical readings of the novel, to a more up-to-date discussion of the animal-human relation in it and its relevance to the ethical principles of ecocriticism, and of current cultural ideas about literature and its ability to deal with contemporary environmental issues and to con- tribute in solving current environmental problems. Although critics' re- sponses to Swift's conception of horses differ greatly, they have in com- mon an anthropocentric understanding of these horses. I will argue, however, that Swift himself is far from anthropocentric in Gulliver's Travels; that he is, on the contrary, highly attentive to animal issues; and that indeed neither the intensity nor the direction of his animal advocacy has yet been fully recognized. This new reading of Gul- Naturc arid Culture 6(3), Winter 2011 : 285-304 ® Berghahn Journals doi : 10.3 1 67/nc.201 1 .060305</page><page sequence="2">E MOHAMMAD SHAABAN AHMAD DEYAB liver's Travels will demonstrate Swift as a harbinger of Richard Ker- ridge's definition of ecocriticism in Writing the Environment (Kerridge and Sammells 1998). Kerridge views ecocriticism as an approach that "seeks to evaluate texts and ideas in terms of their coherence and use- fulness as responses to environmental crisis" (ibid.: 5). In other words, interpreted with the ecocritical concepts of human commitment in mind, the novel points out the potential of literature to explore and draw attention to existing past and present environmental problems as a speculative first step towards their practical resolution. To this end, the article moves back and forth between theoretical concepts of ec- ocriticism as regards animals on the one hand, and a close reading of Gulliver's Travels on the other. The emergence of ecocritical and "post-human" theories has led to a renewed interest in nature and the place of animals therein (cf. Cosslett 2006, Dorre 2007). Proponents of those theories have argued that we are living in a posthuman world, in which the absolute boundaries between humans and nonhumans, as well as between na- ture and society, have been broken down, and all beings are con- nected together in a series of overlapping "webs" or "networks" of activity (Jaques 2007). As Kenneth Brown observes: We share our existence with a great variety of other animals, and through- out history these animals have played a significant role in our customs, leg- ends, and religions in all parts of the world. These animals exist beside us, below us, above us, and often with us. They are a feature of our natural world and a source of human curiosity, fascination, and study. (Brown 2006: 411) This perception of the significant role of animals in human life has been disseminated and stressed by many animal advocates. They be- lieve that "part of the problem is how we think about animals - or worse, fail to think about them at all, simply going about our business as if we were the planet's only living inhabitants" (Malamud 2007: 1 5). In order to have a better relationship with ourselves and with other non- human beings, animal advocates believe that humans should stop con- sidering themselves as if they were more valuable than other animals. Well aware of the significance of this indissoluble relationship between humans and animals, ecocriticism, despite being a hetero- geneous critical approach on the details of which there is no common agreement, "attempts to find a common ground between the human and the nonhuman to show how they can coexist in various ways, be- cause the environmental issues have become an integral part of our existence" (Serpi 1999). Therefore, ecocriticism advocates a rethink- 286</page><page sequence="3">AN ECOCRITICAL READING OF JONATHAN SWIFT'S GULLIVER'S TRAVELS ing of our commonly held beliefs and perceptions, and our awareness of nature, with the aim of creating a "consciousness of the essential unity of all life" (Eisler 1990: 26). Ecocriticism and Animal-centrism Ecocriticism has been described as "the study of the relationship be- tween literature and the physical environment," with much effort ex- pended on "examining nature writing and more recent 'green' writings of ecologically-minded poets and novelists" (Clotfelty and Fromm 1996: xix). Moreover, ecocriticism, as Slovic argues, "per- ceives human beings in their relation to the natural world and thus strives to establish the idea of kinship to the nonhuman world" (1 999: 26). Asserting that human beings are evolved from, molded, and nourished by the earth, ecocriticism asserts that "the individuality of an organism is not definable except through its interactions with its environment, through its interdependences" (Kroeber 1994: 7). This explains why the boundaries of the approach continue to expand to include animals and their relationships with humans. All ecological criticism, therefore, shares the fundamental prem- ise that man is connected to animals, affecting them and affected by them. For ecocritics, those who deny that we have any contact with an- imals are ignoring the fact that "it is in the clothes we wear and in the food we eat ... that we have our most immediate day-to-day contact with animals" (Estok 2007: 66). Moreover, since "animals are an eco- critical issue" (ibid.: 63), ecocriticism should explore "the problematic distinction between our species and other animals" and also "the dif- ferent ways in which animals, wild and domestic, are represented and conceptualized" (Garrard 2004: 15). As Sue Campbell puts it: The most important challenge to traditional hierarchies in ecology is the concept of biocentrism - the conviction that humans are neither better nor worse than other creatures (animals, plants, bacteria, rocks, rivers) but sim- ply equal to everything else in the natural world. (Campbell 1996: 128) This biocentric trend of ecocriticism is formulated in ethical debates concerning the relationship between humans and these animals. How- ever, within ecocriticism itself, two movements are split apart when the issue of animals and their relationship with humans is raised: namely, the animal rights movement and the animal welfare move- ment. The advocates of the former movement believe in an animal's 287</page><page sequence="4">H MOHAMMAD SHAABAN AHMAD DEYAB natural right to a secure life, not threatened by destructive human in- terference. "They seek to establish basic rights for animals and to stop the abuse and exploitation of animals by humans. Those who believe in animal welfare, on the other hand, tend to accept humans' use of animals, as long as that use is humane" (Anonymous 201 1 : n.p.). This ethical debate about animals and their relationship with humans was the interest of many writers in eighteenth-century England. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, several notable philosophers and writers spoke out against the mistreatment of animals. For exam- ple, John Locke (1632-1704) argued that children should be taught from an early age that maltreating and killing any living thing was ab- horrent. In 1713 the poet Alexander Pope wrote an article entitled "Against Barbarity to Animals" for London's Guardian newspaper. Early champions of increased kindness to animals were Samuel John- son, Emmanuel Kant, and Jeremy Bentham, who famously posited: "The question is not, Can they reason? Nor, Can they talk ? But, Can they suffer?" (Munro 2001 : 1 7). As Harold Guither puts it: By the beginning of the eighteenth century, writers began to discuss animal feelings of pain and suffering, vivisection (the surgical operations performed upon live animals during experiments), cruel treatment of animals raised and slaughtered for food, and the religious teachings that influenced hu- mane treatment of both humans and animals. This new emphasis upon ani- mals' feelings of sensation in the eighteenth century brought growing criticism of some forms of cruelty. (Guither 1 998: 1 ) Literary writers of the eighteenth century, such as Swift, portray animals in a way that reflects their own concerns and attitudes regarding ani- mals and their relationship with humans. Like many animal stories, Gulliver's Travels is not only a story to be told, but it also expresses its author's ethical stance regarding animals. As Joseph Wood Krutch wrote: "Animal stories are always more than just a story: Sometimes consciously and sometimes unconsciously (but always inevitably) the writer implies an answer to one or more of the questions which any concern with an animal must raise" (quoted in Arbuthnot and Suther- land 1972: 393). Swift as an Early Advocate of Ecological Studies and Concern for Animals Overlooked by many critics, Swift's Gulliver's Travels not only pro- vides political, social, and historical observations of the eighteenth 288</page><page sequence="5">AN E CO C R I TI CA L READING OF JONATHAN SWIFT'S GULLIVER'S TRAVELS century, but it also brings forth important ecocritical and animal is- sues. In this novel, Swift seems to be propagating ecocriticism long before the genre has emerged. In analyzing Gulliver's Travels, and es- pecially part 4, one can easily identify some ecocritical issues related to animals and their relationship with humans. These issues can be summed up as follows: (1) representing and empowering animals by giving them a voice to articulate their points of view, (2) endowing an- imals with human characteristics, and (3) exposing the cruel living conditions of animals and how they are abused by humans. Representation of Animals One of the most important features of ecocriticism demonstrated in Gulliver's Travels is the representation of animals. In part 4, "A Voyage to the Country of the Houyhnhnms," Swift is successful in presenting animals from a most sympathetic ecocritical perspective. Like typical modern animal activists and ecocritics, Swift seems to advance more or less the same argument as that outlined by Jamieson over two cen- turies later: Animals and humans are similar in ways that count. They are conscious be- ings capable of enjoying life or experiencing pain and suffering. Both share the ability for suffering. Animals are innocent. They have done nothing to deserve human mistreatment or cruelty. Treating animals well helps create a more benevolent society, whereas cruelty and abuse leads to moral bank- ruptcy. (Jamieson 2002: 149) I start my analysis with part 4 of the novel because, more than all the other parts, it presents an unequivocal embodiment of Swift's "ec- ocritical" attitude toward the animal-human relation. Forced to live away from humans, Gulliver finds himself in a land that is closer to nature than anything else. The land "was divided by long rows of trees, not regularly planted, but naturally growing; there was a great plenty of grass, and several fields of oats" (168). From Gulliver's first description, the land of the Houyhnhnms looks to the reader like an idyllic land of species living together, but the horses are the dominant one: "I saw many tracts of human feet and some of cows, but most of horses" (168). The horses are not the usual types of horses Gulliver used to see in Britain. "We stood gazing at each other for some time; at last I took the boldness to reach my hand towards his neck, with a design to stroak it; using the common style and whistle of jockies, when they are going to handle a strange horse" (1 69-1 70). Although Gulliver is trying to be civil with the horse, "this animal seeming to 289</page><page sequence="6">E MOHAMMAD SHAABAN AHMAD DEYAB receive my civilities with disdain, shook his head, and bent his brows, softly raising up his left fore foot to remove my hand" (1 70). Those horses are called the Houyhnhnms, and "the word 'Houy- hnhnm/ in their tongue, signifies a horse; and, its etymology, the 'per- fection of nature'" (177). With the sequence of events we come to acknowledge that they are truly representatives of the "perfection of nature." Being closer to nature, these horses are definitely different from the domesticated ones in Gulliver's home country: "The behav- iour of these animals was so orderly and rational, so acute and judi- cious, that I at last concluded they must needs be magicians, who had thus metamorphosed themselves upon some design" (1 70-1 71 ). More- over, because the Houyhnhnms live in the wild, enjoying the freedom nature gives them, they never experience disease or suffering: "I have already observed, that they are subject to no diseases, and therefore can have no need of physicians. However, they have excellent medi- cines composed of herbs, to cure accidental bruises and cuts in the pastern, or frog of the foot by sharp stones, as well as other maims and hurts in the several parts of the body (206)." Endowing Animals with Human Characteristics By getting closer to these horses, Gulliver's anthropocentric attitude gradually changes into an anthropomorphic one. From an ecocritical perspective, Gulliver should be praised both for being able to tran- scend his former attitude, and likewise for radically changing his vi- sion of horses from condescending civility to reverent admiration. Gulliver now perceives that these horses are not only human-like, but even superior to humans. This leads him to disparage his own species, of which he was once so proud, and at the same time to exalt other nonhuman beings, which he had previously underestimated. In other words, the process of humanizing those these horses has taken hold of Gulliver and absolutely transformed his attitude towards them. By humanizing these horses, Swift intends to render his Houy- hnhnms the spokespersons for all animals, who are unable to articu- late their pain, their feelings, and their needs, or to write down their experiences. Hence, Swift animates them, making them sensitive and communicative subjects who can experience pain and suffering and have interests and needs of their own. Swift's choice of horses, in par- ticular, as representatives of their species may be attributed to a gen- eral fascination with horses that was prevalent in his time. As Donna Landry puts it: 290</page><page sequence="7">AN E CO C R I T I CAL READING OF JONATHAN SWIFT'S GULLIVER'S TRAVELS □ "Swift's contemporaries during the first four decades of the eighteenth cen- tury were so horse-obsessed that many of them devoted their lives to deal- ing, breeding, stabling, shoeing, medicating, schooling, riding, driving, hunting, and racing horses, and to their artistic representation." (Landry 2004: 46) Language is one criterion for differentiating between humans and an- imals. This barrier vanishes once Gulliver has discovered the horses' ability to use a language of their own. Gulliver is surprised to find out that the horses can communicate, exactly as human beings do: "He neighed three or four times, but in so different a cadence, that I almost began to think he was speaking to himself in some language of his own" (170). Moreover, "in speaking, [the Houyhnhnms] pronounced through the nose and throat, and their language approacheth nearest to the High-Dutch, or German, of any I know in Europe; but is much more graceful and significant" (1 76). Furthermore, Gulliver "observed that their language expressed the passions very well, and the words might, with little pains be resolved into an alphabet more easily than the Chinese" (171). By presenting the Houyhnhnms as having a language of their own through which they can express their feelings and thoughts, Swift hu- manizes them, and challenges the prevailing notion that only humans can possess mental capacities and reasoning. Moved by the desire to establish a higher moral status for animals than the one already estab- lished in eighteenth-century England, Swift portrays the horses as more humanized than humans themselves. Gulliver feels joy when he imitates these horses: "By conversing with the Houyhnhnms, and looking upon them with delight, I fell to imitate their gait and gesture" (211). Gulliver's attempt to imitate their language is in itself a para- doxical attempt to overcome the human/nonhuman divide within the discourse itself. As Val Plumwood puts it, The assumption that we as humans can therefore speak as nonhuman na- ture seems to play on inclusive and exclusive senses of 'nature,' and also to assume that we can somehow completely eliminate the nature/culture divide, not merely overcome its dualistic construction. (Plumwood 1997: 349) The relationship between the individual and the environment is one of interrelatedness, since man is considered an integral part of the ecosystem (Evernden 1 996: 93). The essence of the ecological theory is man's identification with animals, which helps humans experience the sufferings of animals. This will lead, in a sense, to the prevention of animal maltreatment at the hands of humans. This system, based on 291</page><page sequence="8">E MOHAMMAD SHAABAN AHMAD DEYAB the intrinsic interconnection between man and animal, is a significant element which explains why Gulliver is happy to live with the horses: I enjoyed perfect health of body, and tranquility of mind; I did not feel the treachery or inconstancy of a friend, nor the injuries of a secret or open en- emy.... [H]ere was neither physician to destroy my body, nor lawyer to ruin my fortune; no informer to watch my words and actions, or forge accusa- tions against me for hire. (209) Through his personal interaction with the natural environment represented by the Houyhnhnms, Gulliver recovers his joy of life and begins to see himself as part of nature. Gulliver becomes emotionally and spiritually related to everything in nature. When he is advised to leave the land of the Houyhnhnms, against his will, he thinks of go- ing to live on "some small island uninhabited, yet sufficient by my la- bor to furnish me with necessaries of life, which I would have thought a greater happiness, than to be first minister in the politest court of Eu- rope, so horrible was the idea I conceived of returning to live in the society and under the government of Yahoos" (214). Gulliver's happy dwelling among the Houyhnhnms makes him re- ject normal life among his fellow humans, whom he considers "Ya- hoos." Gulliver shares with environmentalists their fundamental belief that when people get away from the complications of human culture, they are able to gain a spiritual connection with nature. He believes that happiness is obtainable only in nature. When he returns to England to stay for the rest of his life, Gulliver wants to "return to enjoy my own speculations in my little garden at Redriff; to apply those excel- lent lessons of virtue which I learned among the Houyhnhnms; ... to behold my figure often in a glass, and thus, if possible, habituate my- self, by time, to tolerate the sight of a human creature: to lament the brutality of Houyhnhnms in my own country, but always treat their persons with respect" (223). From an ecocritical perspective, living in nature is connected with themes of happiness, health, rationality, and power. Gulliver's life in nature and with horses convinces him that his countrymen are not equal to the other animals in the natural life, but rather inferior to them. Because of his interaction with the horses, Gulliver comes to recognize the true nature of men, which he finds similar in many as- pects to that of Yahoos: "When I thought of my family, my friends, my countrymen, or the human race in general, I considered them as they really were, Yahoos in shape and disposition, perhaps a little more civilized and qualified with the gift of speech, but making no other use of reason than to improve and multiply those vices whereof their 292</page><page sequence="9">AN ECO C R I T ICA L READING OF JONATHAN SWIFT'S GULLIVER'S TRAVELS brethren in this country had only the share that Nature allotted them" (210). In this passage, Gulliver raises another important ecocritical is- sue: the dichotomy between nature and culture. To Gulliver, nature is innocent, whereas human culture is corrupt. When he returns to En- gland, Gulliver can no longer live in the English culture - not even with his friends and family - as he could before. It is as if Swift is say- ing that by living in nature, Gulliver has discovered something that makes normal social life unbearable. Gulliver prefers to live his own life among his domestic horses than return to a normal European fam- ily life: "The first money I laid out was to buy two young stone-horses, which I keep in a good stable, and next to them, the groom is my greatest favourite; for I feel my spirit revived by the smell he contracts in the stable. My horses understand me tolerably well; I converse with them at least four hours every day.... [T] hey live in great amity with me and friendship to each other" (219). Endorsing this "animal-centric" attitude, Gulliver acknowledges that it is no longer acceptable to regard humans as something com- pletely unique. Instead, as if he were a keen ecology advocate, Gul- liver believes that humans badly need to develop a less dominating and aggressive posture towards animals: "I had not been a year in this country, before I contracted such a love and veneration for the inhab- itants that I entered on a firm resolution, never to return to human kind, but to pass the rest of my life among these admirable Houy- hnhnms in the contemplation and practice of every virtue" (195). To sum up, Gulliver, in his close relationship with the Houy- hnhnms, is in a position to see how these horses lead their own lives and have their own experiences, which are as important and interest- ing as our own. Gulliver's experience with the Houyhnhnms invites us, to use Malamud's words, "to come close, to understand that ani- mals' lives are intermingled with our own and that our prosperity is ultimately interdependent on theirs. We're all in this together" (Mala- mud 2007: 15) The Cruel Conditions of Animals One of the main tenets of ecocriticism is to disclose the cruel treat- ment of animals at the hands of humans. Like typical ecocritical writ- ers, Swift is successful in showing how horrible the animals' conditions were in eighteenth-century England. Gulliver's Travels was written at a time when cruelty and maltreatment were the dominant attitudes to- 293</page><page sequence="10">E MOHAMMAD SHAABAN AHMAD DEYAB wards animals. As Kathryn Shevelow says (2009: 10), "England in the eighteenth century was a famously cruel place, a land of slave deal- ers, extreme class distinctions, abject poverty, and horrendous treat- ment of animals - and yet this miasma produced the abolition of slavery, the improvement of prisons and mental hospitals, and the cru- sade against cruelty to animals." During this century, England was regarded as one of the cruelest nations in Europe. Harriet Ritvo observed that "the streets of London were crowded with horses and dogs who served as draught animals and beasts of burden ... animals suffered in the cause of human pleas- ure as well as human profit" (Ritvo 1994: 106). Repelled by the atro- cious maltreatment of animals, many eighteenth-century writers ex- pressed their strong sympathy for animals and aversion to their human tormentors. Swift is one of the best examples of those writers. As a prototype of eco-writers, Swift successfully exposes this cruel treat- ment of animals in Gulliver's Travels. The remainder of this paper will discuss how Swift is an illustrative example of an eco-writer who shows deep concern for animal issues such as the horrible conditions of horses in the eighteenth century, the ethics of keeping pets, and the morality of animal vivisection. Horrible Conditions of Horses During the eighteenth century, horses were badly treated, and the general attitude towards them was one of cruel exploitation and abuse. Of all the species that have direct relationships with humans, horses have historically been subjected to the widest diversity of treatment. They have been sometimes treated gently, but mostly neglected and mistreated. In a deeply moving passage, Gulliver expresses how horses were badly treated in the eighteenth century: The Houyhnhnms among us, whom we called 'horses/ were the most gen- erous and comely animals we had; that they excelled in strength and swift- ness; and when they belonged to persons of quality, employed in travelling, racing, or drawing chariots; they were treated with much kindness and care, till they fell into diseases, or became foundered in the feet; but then they were sold, and used to all kind of drudgery until they died; after which, their skins were stripped, and sold for what they were worth, and their bodies left to be devoured by dogs and birds of prey. (1 81 ) Horses are not only badly treated, but they are also exposed to dangerous diseases as a result of this maltreatment. Gulliver acknowl- edges that the reasons behind many horses' diseases are their ill treat- 294</page><page sequence="11">AN ECOCRITICAL READING OF JONATHAN SWIFT'S GULLIVER'S TRAVELS ment at the hands of his English countrymen: "I did indeed observe, that the Yahoos were the only animals in this country subject to any diseases; which, however, were much fewer than horses have among us, and contracted, not by any ill-treatment they meet with, but by the nastiness and greediness of that sordid brute" (1 97-1 98). Thus, while in Swift's imaginary idyllic land the Houyhnhnms' life in nature saves them from many diseases, the domesticated horses in eighteenth-century England, on the other hand, were suffering from many diseases simply because they were kept by humans. As Robert Cook puts it: "Most diseases of the domestic horse were the fruits of man's domestication of the horse, and that if only horses were permit- ted to live more natural lives, there would be precious little need for veterinarians" (Cook 2001). To sum up, by referring to the terrible conditions of horses in the eighteenth century, Swift has much in common, in various aspects, with many modern animal advocates. However, horses were not the only animals that were abused in the eighteenth century. Sharing more or less the same unfortunate destiny were the so-called pet an- imals, and even worse was the fate of animals that were callously used by heartless humans in research experiments. Pet Animals in Gulliver's Travels Considered from an ecocritical point of view, Gulliver's Travels raises a distressing issue regarding keeping pet animals, in a way that is sig- nificantly relevant to recent debates by animal activists and advo- cates. For Swift, there were grave ethical problems involved in keep- ing animals as pets, as in the eighteenth century they were often abused and maltreated by their very owners; deplorably, this is often still the case nowadays, despite the supposed intellectual and moral enlight- enment of humanity in our age. One way that Swift pointed out his views was to situate Gulliver among people who considered him nothing more than a pet animal for their children to play with. In this way, he gives Gulliver the opportunity to live through animals' condi- tions, and thus enables him to experience in person their pains, needs, and fears; in this way Swift's pleading the case of such unfortunate creatures becomes more touching, and hence more persuasive. This artistic device falls beautifully in line with contemporary ecocritical aesthetics. According to Malamud (2003: 45), part of the ecocritical aesthetic is "to understand animals in their own contexts, not in ours." 295</page><page sequence="12">E MOHAMMAD SHAABAN AHMAD DEYAB Using this invented artistic device, Swift notably succeeds in achiev- ing that end. In part 2, "A Voyage to Brobdingnag," Gulliver is placed in the position of a pet animal himself: It now began to be known and talked of in the neighbourhood that my mas- ter had found a strange animal in the field, about the bigness of a splack- nuck, but exactly shaped in every part like a human creature ... went erect upon two legs, was tame and gentle; would come when it was called, do whatever it was bid, had the finest limbs in the world, and a complexion fairer than a nobleman's daughter of three years old. (71 ) Gulliver is perceived by the Brobdingnags as an animal, and con- tinues to be dealt with as such. When the giant farmer finds Gulliver in the field, he keeps him as a pet animal. Like an animal, Gulliver is perceived as little more than an object, and little thought is given to his needs. Evoking in the reader's mind the possible feelings of a pet animal, Gulliver-expresses his fear of being abused and killed: He considered a while, with the caution of one who endeavours to lay hold on a small dangerous animal in such a manner that it may not be able ei- ther to scratch or bite him; as I myself have sometimes done with a weasel in England.... For I apprehended every moment that he would dash me against the ground, as we usually do any little hateful animal, which we have a mind to destroy. (64) Gulliver starts for the first time to feel how helpless pet animals are mistreated, even though often with the best of intentions. Like a pet, Gulliver is confined to a small space in an empty cage, and suf- fers from an insufficient space to feel free or to exercise. "My master, pursuant to the advice of his friend, carried me in a box the next mar- ket-day to the neighbouring town.... The box was close on every side, with a little door for me to go in and out, and a few gimlet-holes to let in air. The girl had been so careful as to put the quilt of her baby's bed into it, for me to lie down on" (72). Considering the welfare of animals, merely being confined in a cage for a long time denies Gulliver freedom of movement, and thus deprives him of the best joy of life. Worse even than that, Gulliver's careless keeper fails, though perhaps unintentionally, to provide him with the basic necessities of life: food, water, and adequate shelter. A more dangerous accident happened to me in the same garden, when my little nurse, believing she had put me in a secure place ... While she was ab- sent and out of hearing, a small white spaniel belonging to one of the chief gardeners ... came directly up, and, taking me in his mouth, ran strait to his master, wagging his tail, and set me gently on the ground. (86) 296</page><page sequence="13">AN E CO C R I TI CA L READING OF JONATHAN SWIFT'S GULLIVER'S TRAVELS In this connection, it has been observed by many animal advocates in our own age that dealing carelessly with pets, no matter how inadver- tently, can lead to the loss of their lives or to expose them to unnec- essary pain and danger. Thus, reflecting our contemporary animal advocates' point of view of the matter, Gulliver's keeper fails to assess his own pet's basic needs and denies him the five benefits that any re- sponsible person looking after animals should try to provide: (1 ) "free- dom from thirst, hunger, and malnutrition; (2) appropriate comfort and shelter; (3) the prevention or rapid diagnosis and treatment of in- jury, disease, or infestation; (4) freedom from fear; (5) freedom to dis- play most normal patterns of behavior." (Cuither 1998: 212). Being placed in the situation of an animal, Gulliver has the chance to ex- press the feelings of being ill-treated and badly exploited at the hands of humans. When he is asked why he has responded so coldly to his master after being sold to the Queen, Gulliver explains: I owed no other obligation to my late master, than his not dashing out the brains of a poor harmless creature found by chance in his field; which obli- gation was amply recompensed by the gain he had made in shewing me through half the kingdom, and the price he had now sold me for. That, the life I had since led, was laborious enough to kill an animal of ten times my strength ... and that, if my master had not thought my life in danger, her Majesty would not have got so cheap a bargain. (75) Here Gulliver raises an important issue: the cruel exploitation of some pet animals for the mere entertainment of certain callous hu- mans. In the land of giants, Gulliver is brutally used in a variety of ways to provide entertainment for insensitive people who can satisfy his owner's insatiable lust for money: "I was shewn ten times a day to the wonder and satisfaction of all people" (74). Much like animals we see nowadays in a circus, Gulliver "was placed upon a table in the largest room of the inn.... My master, to avoid a crowd, would suffer only thirty people at a time to see me.... I was that day shewn to twelve sets of company; and as often forced to go over again the same fopperies, until I was half dead with weariness and vexation" (72-73). The use of Gulliver (the pet animal) as a means of entertainment presents serious issues concerning the welfare of the individual ani- mal used as a pet. After weeks of public exhibitions and laborious works, Gulliver starts to lose his health, and therefore to decrease his benefit to his master: The frequent labors I underwent every day made in a few weeks a very con- siderable change in my health; the more my master got by me the more in- satiable he grew. I had quite lost my stomach, and was almost reduced to a 297</page><page sequence="14">E MOHAMMAD SHAABAN AHMAD DEYAB skeleton. The farmer observed it, and, concluding I must soon die, resolved to make as good a hand of me as he could. (74) There can be no justification for Gulliver's being forced to spend long laborious hours for no other reason than to satisfy humans' lust for money, or for perverse forms of entertainment. Gulliver is well aware that the farmer does not have any sympathetic feelings for him, but keeps him only as long as he is profitable to him. The emotional relationship between Gulliver and the farmer is nonexistent. Had the farmer offered Gulliver some kind of love or emotion, things might have been different. Swift's implicit message is quite clear: if it is nec- essary to keep pets, they should be truly loved, for no selfish ends, and should also be dutifully attended to. As Froma Walsh puts it (2009: 481), "pets respond eagerly to care and attention, offering un- conditional love and nonth reaten ing physical contact in holding and petting - crucial human needs." This mutual relationship between pets and their keepers is exem- plified by the relationship between Gulliver and the Queen, to whom he is sold and who takes a great fancy to him as her newest and most fascinating pet: "The queen became so fond of my company that she could not dine without me. I had a table placed upon the same at which her Majesty eat" (78). Yet it must be noted here that despite be- ing truly fond of Gulliver and considering him a close member of her family, whose constant company she is eager for, the Queen's insis- tence on procuring him as her private pet comes out of her desire to possess an interesting pet animal of her own, who has proved to be an amazing prodigy, rather than to save Gulliver from the exploitation and suffering he has experienced at the hands of his previous owner. Trying to look into the causes behind such fond mutual relationship between some owners and their pets, Belk says: Owners attribute 'personhood' to their pets through several mechanisms, in- cluding the recognition of subjective thought, the possession of individual personalities, likes and dislikes, seeing the animal as emotional and capable of engaging in reciprocal social relationships and affording the animal a so- cial place as a member of the family or close friend. (1 996: 1 22) Swift's implication, however, is that even when owners are truly fond of their pets, they may inadvertently expose them to serious dan- gers. Interesting enough, being the Queen's pet will not save Gulliver from being exposed to a number of dangerous incidents where his life is at stake. For example, one time he is attacked and almost killed by rats the "size of a large mastiff" (69); another time he is carried away 298</page><page sequence="15">AN ECOCRITICAL READING OF JONATHAN SWIFT'S GULLIVER'S TRAVELS 3 by a mischievous monkey, but as soon as the monkey releases Gul- liver, an order is given to kill that monkey: "The monkey was killed, and an order made, that no such animal should be kept about the palace" (91). This means that although the Queen is truly concerned about the safety of her pet, she is unable to protect him all the time. Swift seems to be insinuating that with all the good intentions of some pet owners, they are violating the right of these helpless creatures to live a natural and happy life. Swift as an Antivivisectionist Using animals for medical or scientific experimentation has been an important issue among writers and philosophers throughout the ages. "In the seventeenth century, after the discovery of the blood circula- tion by Harvey, vivisection for teaching became routine in European universities" (French 1999: 250). By the end of the seventeenth cen- tury, "objections to dissection and vivisection had started due to the emerging of the scientific revolution. It is only occasionally from the earlier period that we hear of such objections" (Kean 1998: 10). By the beginning of the eighteenth century, writers began to discuss ani- mals' feelings of pain and suffering as a result of vivisection. The very idea of using animals in medical research has up to now been viewed as abhorrent and morally corrupt by animal advocates. During the eighteenth centurycritics were questioning what appropri- ate human behaviour towards nonhumans was. "Doubts about the ethics of using animals in medical research were raised as early as 1 71 4" (Guither 1 998: 1 ). For example, the famous eighteenth-century poet Alexander Pope (1688-1744) became a committed antivivisec- tionist after witnessing the blood circulation experiments of Reverend Stephen Hales (1677-1761). As Pope said, "he [Hales] commits most of these barbarities with the thought of its being of use to man; but how do we know that we have a right to kill creatures that we are so little above as dogs, for our curiosity, or even for some use to us?" (quoted in Maehle 1 990: 41 ) In this Pope was not alone. Samuel John- son (1709-1784) fiercely attacked vivisectionists through his weekly newspaper, The Idler: Among the inferior Professors of medical knowledge is a race of wretches, whose lives are only varied by varieties of cruelty.... What is alleged in de- fense of these hateful practices everyone knows, but the truth is, that by knives, fire, and poison knowledge is not always sought and is very seldom 299</page><page sequence="16">E MOHAMMAD SHAABAN AHMAD DEYAB attained.... It is time that universal resentment should arise against these horrid operations, which tend to harden the heart, extinguish those sensa- tions which give man confidence in man, and make physicians more dread- ful than gout or stone, (quoted ibid.: 41) Like Pope and Johnson, Swift forcefully protested against using animals in medical experimentation. He rejected Descartes' "beast- machine" concept, and argued that animals feel pain, and that this pain ought to be taken into consideration. Like many animal advo- cates, Swift opposed animal experimentation (vivisection) on ethical grounds, believing that it is morally wrong to harm one species in the hope of benefiting another. Furthermore, he realized that the experi- ments had mostly yielded nothing of use. Swift satirized those who believe that animals' lives do not have any kind of value, and called for caring and respecting that life deeply. To Swift, as well as to other advocates of animal welfare, "animals deserve respect as living be- ings, and therefore should not be considered as tools for educational purposes" (Tréz 2001 : 1 7). In Gulliver's Travels , Swift finds a way to vent his anger at the Royal Academy and its experiments on animals. Hence Swift is con- sidered a great exponent of the "virtuoso-satire," which ridiculed sci- entists' using animals for medical research. He "employed the by-then old virtuoso-satire when in 1726 he depicted the 'grand Academy of Lagado' in Gulliver's Travels" (Maehle 1990: 32). In part 3, "A Voyage to Laputa," Gulliver sees in the Academy of Science how they abuse animals for medical experiments. In the Academy, he finds some sci- entists busy conducting experiments on a dog, while the animal is still alive, to find a cure for colic. Gulliver's description of the dying dog calls for the necessity of providing high standards of humane care and ethical treatment of all laboratory animals: I saw him try both experiments upon a dog; but could not discern any effect from the former. After the latter, the animal was ready to burst, and made so violent a discharge, as was very offensive to me and my companions. The dog died on the spot, and we left the doctor endeavouring to recover him by the same operation. (137) The Royal Society's methods were often cruel, and provoked violent responses from philosophers of the age. For example, the famous French philosopher and thinker Voltaire was greatly shocked by the fact that scientists were using dogs in their experiments: Barbarians seize this dog, which surpasses man so greatly in his capacity for friendship; they nail him to a table, and dissect him alive to show you the 300</page><page sequence="17">AN ECOCRITICAL READING OF JONATHAN SWIFT'S GULLIVER'S TRAVELS H mesenteric veins. You discover in him the same organs of feeling that are in yourself. Answer me, machinist, has nature arranged all the springs of feel- ing in this animal in order that he should not feel? Has he nerves in order to be unmoved? Do not suppose such a pointless contradiction in nature. (Voltaire 1962: 112) The suffering and inhumane treatment of the dissected dog in the Royal Academy contributed, one can argue, to the rapid growth in the movement of animal experiment oppositionists, by drawing more people to the debate on vivisection. During medical experimentation, animals were subjected to all manner of cruel and sometimes painful procedures, and in the end they are disposed of. As Cindy Mur puts it: In addition to suffering through the experiments, they are under constant stress from fear, the loss of control over their lives, and the denial of all that is natural and meaningful to them, such as enjoying the company of others of their own kind and choosing. Most people believe, or want to believe, that animals would not be used in experiments if their use weren't ab- solutely necessary. (Mur 2004: 29) According to many animal advocates, using animals in scientific ex- periments is objectionable and ethically unacceptable because many animals suffer and die in such cruel and often futile experiments. In this sense, Swift may well be called an "antivivisection ist" and is very close to contemporary animal-rights activists who "believe that all an- imals deserve the same rights as humans, including the right to free- dom from unnecessary or unjustifiable pain or discomfort" (ibid.: 7). Conclusion As is evident, long before ecocriticism has come to be recognized as a significant study of the practical relationship between literature and the environment, Swift's Gulliver's Travels propagated the same con- cepts as this contemporary interdisciplinary cultural approach, re- garding the relation between humans and animals as well as the emerging universal concerns about the common flagrant violation of animal rights. Thus, to revive the interest of the contemporary reader in this superb eighteenth-century masterpiece, Gulliver's Travels ought to be read as an ecologically oriented text that is preoccupied essen- tially, though somewhat obliquely, with the contemporary issues of animal welfare, including the antivivisectionist campaigns, and with the steadily growing international organizations dedicated to enacting 301</page><page sequence="18">E MOHAMMAD SHAABAN AHMAD DEYAB binding universal laws for the prevention of all forms of cruelty to- wards animals. With its sharp satire and its wildly imaginative con- ceptions of reversed animal-human relationships, where the tables are turned, the tormentors become the tormented, the maltreated slaves become the lords and the lords become their humble servants, and the noble human becomes a humiliated pet animal used to en- tertain children and farmers, Swift's novel at once gives vent to his intense indignation against man's inexcusable cruel treatment of ani- mals, and also heralds the expanding animal welfare movements and the numerous other animal rights movements that have emerged and developed in our modern times. Taking into consideration that Gul- liver's Travels was written at least two centuries before such cultural ecocritical movements came into being, one can rightly declare the prophetic quality of this distinguished masterpiece and the rare in- sightful vision of its author, who deserves to be far more highly es- teemed than he presently is. Thus it may safely be said that Swift's Gulliver's Travels offers a sig- nificant contribution to contemporary ecocritical movements, which use more or less the same arguments that Swift used over two cen- turies ago to make the same point about the same issue. Engrossed with animals and their deplorable status in the eighteenth century, Swift can be said to have laid, in this classic novel, a substantial foun- dation for the future formation and subsequent application of current ecocritical theories. On the other hand, read from this new ecologi- cal perspective, the novel richly yields fresh meanings and elucidates profound implications formerly shrouded in Swift's labyrinthine satire, and in this way projects and illumines new aspects of one of the most important issues that have obsessed the minds and touched the hearts of the high-minded, intellectual readership of today. Calling obliquely, through its poignant satirical style, for a more humane treatment of animals, and constantly striving to provoke a hu- man feeling of compassion and responsibility for these helpless, inar- ticulate creatures, the novel brings major contemporary ecological issues to the foreground, and thus provides a new vision of an eco- logical understanding of the animal-human relationship, one that leads, to borrow Andreas-Holger Maehle's words (1990: 50), to a "growth of sensitivity to animal suffering among the educated public, secondly to the contemporary discussion about the nature of animals and their relationship to man and thirdly to the preoccupation with the consequences of cruelty to animals for man's moral standards." 302</page><page sequence="19">AN ECOCRITICAL READING OF JONATHAN SWIFT'S GULLIVER'S TRAVELS ¡1 E Mohammad Shaaban Ahmad Deyab is an Assistant Professor in the Depart- ment of English at Minia University, Egypt.
