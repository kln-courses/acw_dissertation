Patrick Atkinson Kettering University Roger Haut Michigan State University Chris Eusebi and Tim Hill Breed Technologies ABSTRACT Numerous studies have documented that lower extremity injury is second only to the head and face in automotive accidents. Such injuries are common because the lower extremity is typically the first point of contact between the occupant and the car interior. Of all lower extremity inju- ries, the knee is the most common site of trauma. This typically results from high speed contact with the instru- ment panel which can produce fracture and subfracture (contusions, lacerations, abrasions) level injuries. Cur- rent Federal safety guidelines use a bone fracture crite- rion which is based solely on a peak load. The criterion states that loads exceeding 10 kN will likely result in gross bone fracture. However, cadaver experiments have shown that increased contact area (via padding) over the knee can significantly increase the amount of load that can be tolerated before fracture or subfracture injury. Thus, injury prediction protocols which account for both load and contact area over the knee would produce a more sensitive injury criterion. Currently, knee injury is assessed in car crash simulations using Hybrid III dum- mies. Unfortunately, the cadaveric load-area data is not directly applicable to the dummy due to differences in geometry and material properties. A recent study devel- oped a transformation protocol which provides a simple means of predicting the load-area response of the cadaver via load-area data recorded from a dummy experiment. In the current study 10 car crash simula- tions were conducted using a generic sled and two differ- ent, idealized knee bolster materials. Tests were conducted over a range of Delta-V's and a variety of restraint scenarios (unbelted, belted, full power airbag, depowered airbag). After transformation of the dummy load-area data, it was concluded that the injury risk in a corresponding cadaver test was heavily dependent on the composition of the knee bolster and the kinematics of the dummy. More specifically, stiffer knee bolsters, insuf- ficient restraint, and large delta-V's contributed to an increased risk of knee fracture. Such data are useful in the design of future instrument panels and car interiors to provide increased knee injury protection for car occu- pants. INTRODUCTION A common result of automotive accidents is injury to the lower extremity; approximately one in four car accidents result in an injury to the lower extremity. While these inju- ries are typically not life threatening, they are a cause of permanent disability and impairment (1). In addition to the potential for reduced quality of life following injury, it is estimated that the annual cost of lower extremity injuries among passenger vehicle occupants at $21.5 billion (2). As a matter of perspective, the lower extremity injury inci- dence rate is second only to the head and neck (3). With regard to the lower extremity, the knee is the most com- monly injured body region. In a comprehensive analysis of governmental accident statistics (the National Accident Sampling System/Crashworthiness Data System or NASS/CDS), data from years 1979-1995 inclusive were reviewed (3). Considering all levels of injury (minor and severe), the data showed that the knee was injured in approximately one in ten car accidents. The injuries included minor injuries (contusions, abrasions, lacera- tions) and fracture level injuries to the patella, femur, and tibia. The high frequency of knee injuries may be explained by the kinematics of occupants in frontal collisions. The knee is commonly the first point of contact with the auto- motive interior in a frontal collision. This is reflected in the NASS/CDS statistics which site the knee bolster as the number contact point resulting in knee injury. As the car decelerates, the occupant experiences an inertial acceleration with respect to the vehicle. During the first 1127</page><page sequence="2">20-30 ms of motion the occupant largely experiences a translation towards the instrument panel. The knees then make contact with the knee bolster, essentially stopping the lower extremity. The upper body continues moving via rotation about the hip. Thus, the knee-bolster contact frequently represents the first anatomical contact point through which the energy of moving body may be dissi- pated. This energy is transformed into deformation of the knee bolster and deformation of the tissues of the knee-thigh-hip complex. Commonly, knee bolsters are designed to plastically deform as a means of dissipating the kinetic energy of the moving occupant. Thus, this transformation of energy optimizes occupant kinematics by gradually stopping the occupant. A knee bolster design which was made of an elastic material would be undesirable as it would return the energy back to the occupant. In addition, to the energy absorption charac- teristics of the knee bolster, an additioanl design consid- eration must be the protection of the knee. Thus, a bolster design which optimized occupant crash kinemat- ics while protecting the knee would be beneficial. In an effort to optimize the bolster design, the mechanism of injury of knee injury must be addressed. Many impact studies have been conducted on the human cadaver knee in an effort to establish injury criteria which could ultimately be used for design purposes. Early cadaver studies were conducted by Patrick and coworkers (4) who conducted sled tests with embalmed cadavers. Additional impact studies were then conducted on fresh, stationary cadavers by Melvin, et al. (5), and Powell, et al. (6). Analysis of the experimental data from these studies serves as the basis for the current knee injury criteria adopted by the Federal Government (Federal Motor Vehi- cle Saftey Standard 208) (7). This injury actually applies to the knee-thigh-hip complex and was designed to address knee impacts directed axially along the femur. The criteria states that loads exceeding 10 kN will likely result in gross bone fracture. Analysis of the data from these experiments suggests, however, that peak load alone may not be the sole parameter of interest. Of the three cadaver studies noted above, half were conducted with a rigid impact interface and half were conducted with some degree of padding. In general, the peak loads were similar, regardless of the impact interface. How- ever, even at similar loads, the padded interface experi- ments resulted in a 65% and 14% reduction in patellar and femoral condyle fractures, respectively, versus the rigid interface experiments. One explanation for the reduction in injuries with the pad- ded interface may be related to the increased extraarticu- lar contact area over the patella and possibly, the femoral condyles. Mathematical modeling of the human cadaver knee reveals that impact loading with a small contact area generates large shear and tensile stresses in the subchondral bone of the patella and femoral groove (8,9). The high stresses in the femur are due to the patella act- ing as a 'wedge' which tends to separate the femoral condyles by producing a fracture line along the femoral groove. The elevated stresses in the patella are due, in part, to the centrally applied anterior contact area which is supported by two outboard reactions from the femoral condyles. This essentially puts the patella in three point bending causing large stresses to develop on the poste- rior surface of the patella. This coincides with the experi- mentally observed location of patellar fracture initiation. In addition to the effects of bending, the large stresses developed in the subchondral bone are the result of the relatively narrow patellofemoral contact area. This approximates a 'line' load in the medial- lateral direction which generates large tensile stresses in the proximal- distal direction (10). This might account for transverse patellar fractures, which are the most frequently observed experimental knee fractures. With padding, the mathematical models predict significant reductions in tensile and shear stresses in the patella and this might account for the reduced incidence of knee injuries in the past cadaver studies. The reduced stresses on the pos- terior patella are the result of the larger contact area over the patella which provides anterior support for the out- board patellofemoral reactions. The conclusion from these theoretical studies indicate that for a given contact area there is a maximum load that can be tolerated before injury occurs. Further, the contact area is going to be a result of the deformation response of the knee tis- sues and the impact interface. Several recent experimental studies specifically address the relationship between peak load, contact area over the knee, and the associated injury potential. In studies on the isolated human cadaver knee, rigid and padded inter- faces were used to deliver a single impact load to the iso- lated knee joint (8). Each knee was impacted at the same load; only the contact area was altered via the use of the different impact interfaces. The rigid interface experiments produced fracture in approximately 90% of all experiments while padding reduced this incidence to only 12%. In addition to load and contact area, other studies have documented a link between the flexion angle of the knee and its tolerance to injury. Dischinger, et al., (11) found that shorter automotive occupants of both sexes are more than twice as likely to injure the knee than taller occupants. This may be due to the seat placement for shorter occupants which affects the knee flexion angle and perhaps the injury tolerance of the knee. This is sup- ported, in part, by studies conducted by Viano, et al., (12) and Haut (13) who impacted knees flexed 45Â°, 60Â°, 90Â°, and 110Â° and found an overall trend that elevated knee fracture loads were associated with elevated flexion angles. The overall finding that flexion angle affects the impact response of the knee may be related to the inter- action of the patella and femur during impact. For exam- ple, at lower flexion angles, the patella will be compressed and experience a proximal migration as it attempts to move proximally over the femoral condyles. Proximal motion is resisted by a tensile load in the patel- lar tendon, thus, putting the patella in tension. Alter- nately, at higher flexion angles, the patella experiences only compressive loads as it is wedged into the femoral</page><page sequence="3">condyles. Regardless of the mechanism, it appears that flexion angle affects the impact response which has implications on injury criteria. As already noted, the cur- rent criterion used by the automotive industry is based on cadaver studies conducted at a 90Â° flexion angle. Because the load required to injure the knee increases with flexion angle, this criterion would overestimate the injury tolerance for flexion angles less than 90Â° and underestimate the injury tolerance for flexion angles greater than 90Â°. Thus, a comprehensive injury criterion would need to account for the knee flexion angle at the point of impact. The above data suggests that a next generation injury criteria would need to account for the knee flexion angle, the magni- tude of the impact load, and the contact area over which it is distributed. In a recent study (3), such a criteria was pro- posed: for a given impact load and flexion angle there is a minimum contact area required to prevent injury. The criteria was based on a large number of isolated cadaver knee impact experiments which were used to establish load-area curves which represented a 50% chance of injury. Injury was defined as a gross fracture of bone. By conducting tests with a variety of impact interfaces at flexion angles of 60Â°, 90Â°, and 120Â° it was possible to establish a load-area injury 'envelope' representing several different occupant kinematics at the point of impact. (For reference, zero degrees of flexion repre- sents a straight leg, and in the normal sitting posture repre- sents a 90 degree flexion angle.) This envelope contained a large number of load-area data pairs which could conceivably result from impact with a wider range of impact interfaces than those used to establish the criteria (see Figures 1 A,B,C). Thus, if the flexion angle, contact area, and peak impact load are known, and the datapoint falls below the injury curve (Figure 1), this can be interpreted as a less than 50% risk of fracture level injury. However, in practice, experi- mental car crash simulations use human surrogates (anthro- pomorphic dummies) to estimate the human response to impact loading. The load-area relationship for the dummy, though, is not directly applicable to the human. While it is true that the dummy is designed to imitate the human cadaveric response (for which the dummy is based), experimental data (14,15) confirm that the load-area relationship for the dummy can be significantly different from the human. Further, these differences may be accentuated based on the composition of the impact interface (i.e. rigid, padded). Thus, it was neces- sary to establish a transformation of the cadaver load-area data to predict the dummy response for a similarly conducted experiment. Thus, it was possible to transform the load-area injury envelope established for the human cadaver knee and make it applicable to the dummy knee. Thus, a crash simula- tion may be performed and one can more specifically predict if injury would have occurred in the human cadaver knee based on the flexion angle at the point of impact, the impact load, and the contact area. The current study was designed to practically apply the flex- ion angle-load-area injury criteria described above by con- ducting crash simulations representing a variety of delta-V's, restraint scenarios, and knee bolster materials. 50th, male Hybrid III dummies were used as human surrogates and the flexion angle, peak load, and contact area over the knee were determined for each crash simulation. The load-area injury criteria were then applied to predict the relative of injury in the human knee. It was expected that stiffer knee bolster materials, higher delta-V's, limited occupant restraint would yield higher loads and smaller contact areas. This would suggest an elevated chance of knee injury. Alter- nately, it was expected that softer bolster materials would generate larger contact areas and reduce the relative risk of knee fracture. METHODS AND MATERIALS ANTHROPOMORPHIC DUMMY TESTS - Ten crash simulations were conducted to represent a variety of crash parameters (delta-V, restraints) and knee bolster materials of varying stiffness (Table 1). Six of the ten tests (tests 1 and 8, tests 5 and 7, and tests 4 and 10) have the same crash parameters with the only difference being the stiffness of the instrument panel material. The tests were conducted on a HYGE (HYdraulic Gas Ener- gized) test system using and a 50th percentile male dummy. The buck was 'generic' in that it was constructed of sheet metal components representing numerous makes and models of cars. The entire crash sequence was recorded via five high speed cameras mounted on the sled buck. The cameras were positioned such that whole body kinematics and knee-to-instrument panel contact were easily visualized. The cameras were mounted: in front of the windshield facing the dummy, fac- ing the instrument panel looking over the dummy's shoul- der, two cameras faced the side of the dummy (one camera was redundant), and the final camera focused on the knee-to-knee bolster impact. An additional stationary camera was placed on the ground adjacent to the moving buck to provide a redundant record of the crash sequence. The dummy was placed in the front passen- ger seat (Figure 2) with the seat placed in the mid- position or full forward (Table 1). Three different materi- als (Figure 3) were used to represent the knee bolster: two different grades of aluminum Hexcel and one grade of an expanded copolymer (Arco chemical company, spe- cific weight = 2.3 lbs/cu ft). In the sled experiments the Hexcel bolsters were covered with a fabric tape to pre- vent potential damage to the dummy's vinyl skin via the sharp edges of the Hexcel foil. For the copolymer tests, a thin sheet (1.5 mm) of ABS plastic was placed over the copolymer material to prevent splitting of this material. To verify the properties of the Hexcel bolster materials, com- pression experiments were conducted on a material test- ing machine (Instron, model 1331. Carefully prepared samples were compressed and the load-deformation response was recorded at a 5 kHz sampling rate. The Hexcel crush strength was determined since this material follows an elastoplastic material model. The first grade of Hexcel was 76.2 mm thick and was experimentally veri- fied to have a crush strength of 1.65 MPa. The second grade of Hexcel was 50 mm thick and had a crush strength of 3.3 MPa (The stiff Hexcel tests (2 in total) are currently in process).</page><page sequence="4">Figure 1 . Curves describing the 50% risk of a fracture level injury in the Hybrid III dummy knee for three flexion angles based on load (N) and contact area (sq mm): (A) 90 degrees, (B) 60 degrees, and (C) 120 degrees. The dotted line in (A) represents an extrapolation of the criterion to include larger contact areas and loads. All three curves may be interpreted as depicted in the 90 degree flexion angle graph: combinations of load and area falling below and to the right of the injury curves indicates a less than 50% chance of fracture. Load and area data falling above and to the left of the cruves represent a greater than 50% risk of a fracture level injury. The curves were developed in a previous study (3) in which a large number of cadaver experiments were conducted with several impact interfaces. The load and area datapoints representing the 50% risk of injury were calculated for the cadaver data for each material. The corresponding load-area datapoints were then experimentally determined for the anthropomorphic Hybrid III dummy knee to make the cadaver tests applicable to safety testing. This is because the current Hybriid III knee typically yields different contact areas and loads versus the cadaver for a given impact experiment. Figure 2.

The schematic (B) depicts the relevant load transducers and the position of the knee bolster materials. 1130</page><page sequence="5">The contact area between the anterior knee and the knee bolster was recorded using a previous methodology. Briefly, the surface of the bolster facing the dummy's knees (Figure 4) was covered with a sheet pressure sen- sitive film (Fuji, Pressensor Film, Montreal, CA). To opti- mize the measurement of contact area, low range pressure sensitive film was used (range: 2-10 MPa) (16). To prevent shear loading artifact, the film was encased in a polyethylene packet secured peripherally to the Hexcel. Following the crash simulation experiment, the film was removed from the packet and analyzed using established methods (8) to determine the contact area over the knee. Briefly, the film images were digitally scanned at 150 dpl. A commercial computer code (SigmaScan) was then used to outline the images to determine the contact area. The load was recorded from the femur load cell and was sampled per SAE specification J21 1 . INJURY PREDICTION VIA THE LOAD-AREA CRI- TERIA -The flexion angle at the point of impact was determined. The load-area data resulting from the dummy tests were then plotted on the appropriate load- area graph coinciding with the most similar flexion angle injury curve (i.e. 60, 90, or 120 degrees). The curve bounds an area that contains load-area datapairs which represent a less than 50% risk of fracture level injury to the knee. Datapoints which exceeded the envelope rep- resented a greater than 50% risk of fracture level injury. By plotting the datapoints from the current study, the rela- tive risk of knee injury was determined for the different car crash simulations. Figure 3.

The upper body then rotated about the hip as the simulation con- cluded. The film data confirmed that the knee was always nearest a 90 degree flexion angle at the point of impact. Not surprisingly, the load and area data resulting from the knee-to-bolster compression were found to be proportional (Table 2) (greater loads produced increased greater contact areas for a given bolster material). In addition, the following parameters generally produced elevated loads at the knee: lack of seat belt restraint, ele- vated delta-V's, and placing the seat further from the instrument panel. Placing the seat full forward signifi- cantly limited the load at the knee by reducing the amount of forward translation experienced by the dummy. More specifically, analysis of the paired tests (1 and 8, 5 and 7, 4 and 1 0) in which the only difference was the stiff- ness of the knee bolster shows the importance of the instrument panel. For example, in crash tests 1 and 8 the soft Hexcel produced a load and contact area which were approximately 50% greater than the copolymer for the same crash/restraint parameters. Further, in crash tests 5 and 7 the stiff Hexcel produced loads and areas which were approximately twice that of the soft Hexcel, again, for the same crash/restraint parameters. Analysis of the pressure film images revealed that nearly all of the dummy-bolster contact area was derived from contact with the dummy's 'knee-cap' (in other words, the distal end of the femoral component). By plotting the load-area data derived from the crash tests it was possible to estimate the relative risk of knee fracture (Figure 5). In tests 1, 7, and 8, the risk of frac- ture exceeded 50%, while the remaining tests the risk was at, or less than, a 50% risk of fracture. Again, the trend for injury risk reflected the crash parameters: there was increased fracture risk with increasing delta-V, insuf- ficient restraint, and increasing stiffness of the knee bol- ster (Table 1, 2 and Figure 5). Specifically, the softer knee bolster material produced larger contact areas for a given load, thus, reducing the risk of fracture. The response of the soft Hexcel and the expanded copolymer were similar. That is, for the range of tests conducted, the load area response of the two materials was similar. Table 1 .

The knee flexion at the point of impact with the IP was consistently about 90 degrees. Thus, the 50% fracture risk curves were used to predict the fracture risk using the load-area data resulting from the crash test simulations with different knee bolster materials: (A) soft Hexcel, (B) stiff Hexcel, and (C) an expanded copolymer material. In the majority of tests, there was a limited (&lt;50%) risk of knee fracture, with the load-area datapoints positioned down and to the right within the injury envelope. Several tests resulted in a greater than 50% risk of fracture and were typically associated with either high speed crashes or insufficient restraint. 1133</page><page sequence="8">DISCUSSION The current study was designed to apply a knee fracture injury criteria which accounted for the flexion angle of the knee at the point of impact, the peak contact load, and the contact area over which the load is distributed. The criteria is based on cadaver experiments which identified the load and contact area associated with a 50% risk of fracture level injuries for a knee flexed 60, 90, or 120 degrees. These load and contact area data were then transformed to represent the response of the dummy knee. To apply the criteria, crash simulations were con- ducted which represented a variety of delta- V's (14 to 30 mph), restraint scenarios (belted, not belted, air bag, no air bag), and knee bolster materials (stiff and soft ideal- ized bolster materials). Hybrid III dummies were used as human surrogates and the flexion angle, peak load, and contact area over the knee were measured. For a major- ity of the tests, it was found that the relative risk of knee injury was less than 50%. However, tests conducted at higher delta-V's with limited restraint, resulted in injury risk levels that equaled or exceeded a 50% injury risk. These data highlight the need for proper occupant restraint and underscores the importance of knee bolster design. The design of the knee bolster requires continued atten- tion since the knee is commonly injured in car accidents and the instrument panel is the leading cause of those injuries in frontal collisions. Optimally, as the occupant experiences an inertial acceleration into the instrument panel, the bolster will deform sufficiently to absorb a por- tion of the occupant's kinetic energy as well as protect the knee from a fracture level trauma. Thus, optimization of the knee bolster would allow improvements in whole body crash kinematics while still protecting the knee. However, knee injuries persist at previous incidence rates, suggest- ing the need for continued attention in this area. It is important to note that the load-area fracture criiterion developed for the dummy was based on serial, isolated cadaver knee tests (3). Thus, the resulting fracture crite- rion is probably conservative. This is for two reasons: 1 ) serial testing may reduce the fracture threshold of the knee, and 2) the isolated knee will fracture at a lower load than a whole cadaver since it does not experience inertial motion. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the 50% injury risk envelope used in the current paper represents a conservative estimate of the 50% risk for fracture level injury. It is also important to note that the femoral load cell records loads from knee-bolster contact as well as loads derived from ankle-footwell contact. These latter loads are transmitted to the femur via the dummy's knee link- age. Thus, the femoral load cell likely overestimates the true knee-bolster load. However, it is estimated that this error would be relatively minor since the knee contacted the bolster at a flexion angle of approximately 90 degrees. Thus, the contact load was parallel to the sen- sitive axis of the load cell. In addition, the majority of the contact involved the dummy's 'knee-cap' and little, if any, contact with the dummy's antero-proximal tibia. Thus, a majority of the femoral load was isolated at the knee. Currently, the automotive injury criterion is based solely on gross bone fracture (4,5,6,7). However, consideration of subfracture or microscopic injuries might be warranted to produce a more conservative criterion. While fracture level injuries of the patella, tibia, and femoral condyles are a well documented impact induced injury, numerous recent studies also document microscopic bone and car- tilage injuries (8,16,17,18). These injuries may be even more insidious than gross injuries because they are diffi- cult to detect acutely and are typically not treated. Fur- ther, these subfracture traumas have been associated with chronic joint pain and disease (1 ,19). Thus, prevent- ing subfracture injuries will be an important consideration in new injury criteria. Incidentally, there is theoretical evi- dence that preventing subfracture injuries would yield a conservative criterion. This is based on the hypothesis that preventing subfracture injuries will also prevent the fracture level injuries. This follows from the idea that frac- ture level injuries begin as subfracture microfractures which can coalesce and form gross fractures if additional energy is imparted to the joint. Future work is needed to develop a comprehensive injury criterion which accounts for subfracture level injuries, different impact interfaces, and the differences between the dummy and human cadaver knee. Future work is needed to better understand the injury mechanisms of the knee and reflect those mechanisms in the design of safer automobiles. In the current study, simple measures of load and area were used to provide an estimation of the risk of fracture level knee injury. Because these data have been transformed to the dummy response, future work could be based on com- puter simulations using well-established finite element models of the dummy. Thus, numerous simulations could be run to identify knee bolster material parameters which optimized both knee safety and whole body kinematics.
