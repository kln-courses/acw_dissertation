The late Thomas F. Woodlock, of the Wall Street Journal, said that the trouble" with the present generation is that "They've never read the minutes of the previous meeting*'; and C. P. Ives, of the Baltimore Sun, has re marked that too many of our opin ions are improvised "as if history be gan y ester day". Professor Hugh Last, of Oxford, England, has declared: "There are tendencies about which bode trouble?not because the people who show them are evil but because they don't understand the funda mental facts of their own civiliza tion." In this little volume Toynbee makes available to us the results of his extensive and profound studies, without requiring a consideration of the dates and details of history. If read with understanding, it is an ab solute cure for our provincialism?our parochialmindedness, as he calls it. The book is a collection of thirteen essays written at different times. They may be read separately, but a common thesis extends through them all and gives them unity. The author has a delightful style of expression, as readers of the author's A Study of History in the abridgement by Somer vell well know. This volume is in tended for the general reader and is more iqtimate and current in its appeal. The author has a remarkable gift for illustrative similes and his torical parallels, but he never allows the development of his similes to carry him too far. He says: These metaphorical applications of the processes of inanimate nature to the delineation of life, and particu larly human life, are perhaps peculiar ly dangerous nowadays just because they are so much in fashion. Not so long ago, the danger was all the other way. We used to think of the processes of inanimate nature anthropomor phically, and the progress of physical science was seriously hindered until this anthropomorphic, mythological habit of looking at physical nature was broken. We have, I think, broken it effectively. In our physical science, we are thoroughly on our guard now adays against the so-called "pathetic fallacy". But perhaps, in extricating ourselves from the "pathetic fallacy", we have fallen unawares into an opposite "apathetic fallacy"?which is every bit as fallacious. We tend, because this feels and sounds "scienti fic", and because science nowadays enjoys prestige, to think and talk about human beings as though they were sticks and stones and about life as though it were a stream of radia tion or a constellation of protons and electrons. This may be a convenient simile, but it is, I am sure, a false route. Let us step out of this rut and set ourselves to think and speak of human civilizations in human terms. Toynbee's scope of vision is majes tic. He sees humankind in a con tinuous movement through time and space. He does not deal with persons, battles, dynasties, or nations, so much as with civilizations. He tries to dis cover and delineate the causes of the rise and fall of these great spiritual movements. Although he searches the centuries, he brings his conclu sions to bear upon the essential prob lems of our "time of troubles". He tries to discover the road we must take if our civilization is to be saved from disaster. Speaking of Greek civilization, he says: So long as the economic life of each city-state remained parochial, they could all still afford to be parochial in their political life as well. The parochial sovereignty of each city state, vis-a-vis every other, might and did breed perpetual petty wars, yet, in the economic circumstances of the age, these wars were not deadly in their social effects. But the new economic system, introduced by the Attic economic revolution under the spur of the stoppage of Greek colonial expansion, was based on local pro duction for international exchange. It could only work successfully if, on the economic plane, the city-states gave up their parochialism and be came interdependent. And a system of international economic interdepen dence could only be made to work if it could be brought within the framework of a system of international political interdependence: some inter national system of political law and order which would place a restraint upon the anarchic parochial sovereign ty of the local city-states. He concludes his survey of Graeeo Roman civilization thus: My conclusion is that we should look at this story as a whole. It is only when it is viewed as a whole that it throws its light upon our own situation in our own world in our day. But, if one does succeed in obtaining this light from it, it proves, experto cre&amp;e, to be most amazingly illumi nating. The author believes that "It is a foregone conclusion that the world is in any event going to be unified politically in the near future". He says: "I think the big and really for midable political issue today is, not whether the world is soon going to be unified politically, but in which of two alternative possible ways this rapid unification is going to come about." In times past, he points out, some great power "knocked out" its competitor and imposed temporary peace on the world by conquest. The Pax Sinica in the Far East and the Pax Romana in the West are illustrations of the "knock - out" method. But he sees the world now engaged in a "new experiment in a co-operative government of the world". He says: "It is evident that we are engaged here on a very dif ficult political pioneering enterprise over largely unknown ground." He concludes: If this enterprise did succeed?even if only just so far as to save us from a repetition of "the knock-out blow" ?it might open out quite new pros pects for mankind: prospects that we have never sighted before during these last five or six thousand years that have seen us making a number of attempts at civilization. Toynbee is not without hope. He gives emphasis to the spiritual and moral forces in life. He sees a pos sibility of Christian countries being affected by Islam's racial tolerance and avoidance of alcohol. But main ly his hope rests upon Christian prin ciples. He believes it possible for this world, even though not perfect, to become a province of the Kingdom of God?a province "in which spiri tual action could, and would, be fully significant and worth while; the one thing of manifest and abid ing value in a world in which all other things are vanity."
