<plain_text><page sequence="1">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW VOLUME 68 APRIL 1975 NUMBER 2 THE UNUTTERABLE SYMBOLS OF (F )-O6Lts Louis ROBERTS SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY SYRACUSE, NEW YORK 13210 In his Protreptikos (2,22) Clement of Alexandria rages against the contents of the mystic chests used in the rites of the mystery religions. Among other items he lists such things as cakes, salt balls, the serpent, and adds as though an afterthought, "the d7rrdob~Tpa uaovpoXa of (Fi)-O04ts, 6ptycavov, a lamp, a sword, and a KTrgy YUVatLK.OSC, which is a euphemism used in the mysteries for the female parts." What was the association of these objects with (F )-OE' L~? What evidence might Clement have had for such an association? Farnell believed that this list of "mystic symbols" in the Protrep. supported his own theory of the goddess IF. He argued that although the sword and the lamp might well be the badge of Themis, a goddess of righteousness, "it is only by supposing that the Themis of these unknown mysteries was something more concrete than this and was allied to an earth divinity of fertilizing function that we could hope to explain the 6ptyavov and the KT7E1 yUVVatLKOfS."I Ehrenburg thought that if there was not confusion in Clement's mind regarding the mysteries, there is here at least evidence for a purely chthonic-agrarian meaning for Themis.2 The order in this paper involves first a consideration of the use of the term av'~poXov by Clement; second, an examination of the nature of the cistae and their possible contents; third, some comment on textual problems; and finally, a consideration of possible new evidence. It turns out that there may be more evidence than Farnell, Ehrenburg, and others have recognized to support their theories. 'Lewis Richard Farnell, The Cults of the Greek States (Chicago: Aegean, 1971) 3, 13, 14. Farnell continues, "If this view is correct, the ancient oracular cult of Ge-Themis acquires a special importance: for it will have given rise to the worship of a higher ethical goddess, who, having broken the shell and escaped the limitations of Gaia, could take on the more universal character of a goddess of righteousness, the common term 04st having always meant more than the mere righteous decision of the oracle." 2Victor Ehrenburg, Die Rechtsidee im Friihen Griechentum (Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1966) 33.</page><page sequence="2">74 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW I. The Term 'vA'pXohov In ancient Greece the words related to a'ipohXov acquired a variety of meanings centering around a notion of matching entities or corresponding pieces. The word came to refer to such things as a sign or mark by means of which one person could give another to understand something; a token, which could prove identity; a contribution of money to a feast; a share of a reckoning; a commercial treaty guaranteeing security and protection. Gradually a meaning indicating abstract values developed. Plutarch emphasized an aspect of oavufpoXov as secret code.3 In the early Christian period it became associated with the set of beliefs constituting the Creed, in the canon known as the Symbol of the Apostles.4 The religious use of the term came to imply that symbols provide information about the object of belief or at least hold power to generate the acquisition of such knowledge. Paintings, for example, in the Roman catacombs show symbols of palms, ships, fish, shepherds, etc. These were not simply intended for decoration or instruction, but were meant to portray meanings that otherwise had to be concealed.5 Is it against an understanding of the term avflpohXov as providing information about the object of belief that Clement apparently rages regarding the gods and goddesses of the mystery religions? Fortunately Clement provides both a theoretical account and practical instances of his use of the term. Clement remarks in Strom. 8,8 - a work which several years of study encourage me to accept as genuine, although tattered : There are three points about sound (w~,r); the terms and symbols (a `ppoAa) of the concepts (vopiarTa) in accord with the guiding principle (ifyOVLKdV) ...; the concepts are likenesses and images of the external object .. .; and third, the underlying meanings from which the concepts are impressed in us. Like many of his contemporaries who were under strong Stoic influence, Clement used au3ppooa primarily of vo4 ia-ra under the control of the guiding principle and derivatively of the object of reference. Consequently he thought that a true symbol could 3Plutarch 2, 611D: rTa IVOTLKa Coa~P4oka TWV 7rept rbTOVL AL voo, 6py1taoY/,4l , &amp; adVLoIE dl &amp;hh otq oi KOLVwOOVTreS. Cf.

Clement is very careful about his use of technical terms and he rarely uses uavfpoXov. An exceptional and illustrative use is found at Strom. 2,19, where he speaks of the mouth, the heart, and hands and says these would be a symbol (av'3ohov 6' &amp;v EY7 avdra). The mouth would be a symbol of logos; the heart, of desire; and the hands, of action. He says this would be a good use of the term, implying the existence in his thought of some kind of direct relation between symbol and referent. He observes (Strom. 5,8) that symbols are most useful in hermeneutics rrp0b ,fpaxvhoyia~a &amp;UK~lV Kat' ao4aw wrpb iv6~Lv.6 Apart from this discussion and a brief treatment of symbols in oriental and Greek authors at Strom. 5,7-9, few other uses of the term are found. In the section of the Protrep., however, with which we are concerned, we find several instances close together. The first is at 2,15, where we read 7r o u opoh.oXa T Av4Ews. This use is equated with a formula.7 Normally Clement uses the term ovvrjOta for such reference.8 Then at 2,18 Clement mentions 7r dXpEla uatpfoXa of the rites of Dionysos. He lists these symbols as knucklebone, the ball, the spinning top, apples, wheel, and fleece. Does he mean they are "useless" because they give no information about Dionysos? At least they are &amp;Xpedov C19 KaTcdyvwotv. The next instance of uv'ozpoXa occurs in the text of principal concern, 2,22: Kai poUort (P"F)-O4'tio60 7r&amp; ard~obp7ra oiaLpoXae bplyavov, Xv'XVo%, e4tio 4, KTI YUvvatKEtO0s, 609s UOrtv eMVCrl77A9 Ka1t lU7rtK()9 ErTELV, lAdptov yvVatLKEOt. Is this use of the term the same as in the two previous instances? The first caveat to observe is that the symbols are said to be &amp;rord pra. The second, that both lamp and sword are included among such symbols. It is difficult to understand why those two objects should be described by such an adjective. We must consequently ask whether we properly understand the adjective, or whether Clement, who is normally careful about such matters, is here careless. For he seems consistently to use &amp;/p-Troa for "unutterable" or "unspeakable" in a derogatory sense and 6Cf.

For the different kinds of containers are related to the possible implication that there are three classes of symbols involved. An additional implication is that the containers are not necessarily the same for each of the classes of symbols. Therefore Clement may be referring to three different sets of mysteries. If so, what are they, and what is the relation between (Fi)-ON4tLs and Demeter? The first class of symbols relates to the "mysteries of Deo." Clement says symbols connected with these mysteries are such as provoke laughter. He quotes as symbols of initiation, "I ate from the drum; I drank from the cymbal; I was a kernos-bearer; I stole into the bridal chamber." Then he asks pointedly, ra--ra oibX 8pL4T rda ouv'tPoXa? Symbols and mysteries are here related, for Clement explains that their content was the aphrodisiac attack and rape by Zeus of his mother Demeter and her ensuing anger. Because there is no evidence for thinking this particular episode associated with the rites of Attic Eleusis, it may well have been part of the rites of mysteries performed at Eleusis in Alexandria.'0 If so, the mysteries involved Rhea. Mylonas thought that Clement "is speaking of rites in which Rhea-Kybele was the honored Goddess to whom the title or epithet Brimo was given."'' The second class of symbols relates to mysteries involving the story of Baubo, who, Clement reports, having received Demeter as a guest, offers her a draught of wine and meal. She declines to take it, unwilling to drink on account of her mourning. Baubo is offended, thinking that she has been slighted, and 9Cf. ibid., 10,82: ob 6d &amp;&amp;pr/7rol 7 )thavXOpwrwia, TroVrov cXxwpi7rol t ptoorrovw7pla; PG 37 (956P): Kal iT / Lpv ppt7TOVJovc cTOv7o racT7p, 7r Si ELS ' lpdv ov/wr&amp;av o yEyorE tT7p.

Karl Kerenyi, Eleusis (New York: Pantheon, 1967) 118, 119: "In Alexandria the rites were not even protected by a rule of secrecy - that is why the Christians knew so much about them. Anyone who wished to could attend and ask questions concerning what happened in the darkness and what in the light. .... In Attic Eleusis anthropomorphism remained predominant; in Alexandria the emphasis was designedly erotomorphic. No attempt whatever was made to conceal it, and it was far from being the Mystery secret." There does not seem to be much evidence to support this conclusion, and Callimachos (Dem. Hymn) is a counter example. "George Mylonas, Eleusis and the Eleusinian Mysteries (Princeton: Princeton, 1961) 291.</page><page sequence="5">LOUIS ROBERTS 77 thereupon uncovers her genitals and exhibits them to the goddess. Demeter is pleased at the sight, and at last receives the draught, delighted with the spectacle. (Protrep. 2,17) Mylonas wanted to dissociate this passage from the Eleusinian mysteries, but Kerenyi has observed that he neglected at least one group of texts which do connect the Baubo figure with Attic Eleusis. These texts, although inconclusive, are difficult to ignore.12 More important is the fact that Clement intends to situate his account at Eleusis in Attica.'3 Clement thinks the symbols connected with these mysteries are useless, because they give no information. Clement's use of the term auvypoXa in connection with these two sets of mysteries accords with his theoretical account of the term. The third class of symbols involves mysteries associated with Themis. What might these mysteries have been? In order to answer this question, we have to consider the containers used in the mysteries for each of the three classes of symbols. II. Cistae mysticae Clement refers to mystic chests in the plural and asks the reader to consider their contents. "For I must strip bare their Hiera and utter the unutterable (apjTra)." Some of the items in his list of Hiera are mentioned in connection with the second set of symbols and some clearly refer to the first set (e.g., ivy leaves and poppies). Regarding the baskets associated with the first set we can observe with Farnell that in the rite the maidens who carried certain offerings dedicated to the goddess carried them on their heads in cistae. Such baskets usually contained fruits and flowers and baked goods. The ritual may have been part of a harvest festival.14 Callimachos provides a description of the celebration which may be what Clement has in mind and which probably occurred at Alexandria. The scholiast tells us that this festival was introduced there from Athens by Ptolemy and he says that the uninitiated 121n the Plutos (101) of Aristophanes a comic old woman boasts of having figured at the bridge in a cart. Kerenyi (Eleusis, 65) believes she was playing the role of lambe or Baubo, who with her jokes and obscene gestures moved Demeter to laughter. 13Mylonas (Eleusis, 292) observes, "The placing of the story at Eleusis; the stay of Demeter by the well in deep sorrow; her sojourn with the mortal rulers; her initial refusal to drink the draught presented to her; her final acceptance.. all these details reflect the tradition of Eleusis well-known to all because of the Homeric hymn." 14Cf. Farnell, Cults, 47.</page><page sequence="6">78 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW were forbidden to raise their eyes from the ground as the sacred basket was drawn by horses through the city.15 This means, however, that different kinds of baskets were used in this Alexandrian procession, small ones carried by maidens on their heads and a large one on a horse-drawn carriage.16 Both large and small baskets appear to have been cylindrical in shape with close- fitting lids that concealed their contents. The third type of basket, that which would have been associated with Themis, is more difficult. We do have an important bit of evidence for it. A Boeotian skyphos now in the collection at TUibingen has a representation of Themis and Bendis. Both goddesses are named. Themis carries a torch similar to that connected with Demeter. She holds a flat basket. The ornament on her head dress is also similar to that often found on Demeter and Kore. It resembles poppies. What is important is that the basket Themis carries in her left hand is different from the previous two cylindrical kinds. The crucial difference is that it has no lid. This basket was probably called a XvKPOV. Callimachos in the Hymn to Demeter mentions this kind of basket (cbq 6' at XLKVokdpot XP"po" rX-'TEa XLKVa cEpourTL, 126). These baskets were rather shallow and broad. Corn was placed in them after threshing and was then thrown against the wind to winnow the grain from the chaff. They were also said to be sacred to Dionysos and were carried on the head at festivals." More significantly, they are probably what Vergil refers to as "Mystica vannus Iacchi" (Georg. 1,166). Servius in commenting on this line notes, alii 'mysticam' sic accipiunt, ut vannum vas vimineum latum dicant, in quod ipsam propter capacitatem congere rustici primitias frugum soleant, et Libero et Liberae sacrum facere. Sometimes reference is made to only a single basket in 15See ibid., 48; Strom. 5,11; Protrep. 2,18. 16The small baskets were also represented in use at Attic Eleusis. They are found portrayed on Caryatids of Pentelic marble. Each of these baskets was cylindrical in form and was decorated with the emblems of the cult of Demeter: a head of wheat, the poppy, the lidded kernos (an earthenware vessel holding a number of small cups cemented together), flanked by small flower rosettes, and a molding which Mylonas believes was meant to represent the Bacchos. Cistae of this proportional size could have been carried on the head and would seem to have been adequate for the Hiera. They would certainly hold the items mentioned by Clement. '7Cf.

More than one is mentioned in the inscription of Andania, where we read that the sacred virgins led the chariots on which were to be seen the cistae which contained the sacred Hiera. Thus it appears that both the number of small and large baskets was plural and that they were of at least three types. Each of the three different types of baskets may have contained a different set of symbols. In the procession which Clement envisions, probably an Alexandrian festival, three different sets of mysteries were represented. It should be noted that we have no actual evidence that Clement actually saw the procession, even though he speaks with the confidence of a witness. Some or all of the baskets in the procession may have contained objects which were not necessarily the Hiera of mystery rites. III. Textual Problems The most obvious problem connected with the Clement text is the name of the goddess. The manuscript reading'8 is Ka t7rpoafr rq OEL60'8o, and this is the reading accepted by Monddsert'9 and all earlier editions. Wilamowitz suggested the emendation accepted by Staihlin of reading IFq for r7-. This is a probable emendation. Writing a tau for a gamma has a probability of .000347,20 which is significant. There is also a precedent (CIG 3.350) on a theatre seat: ilplaq r F OEt608o. Although the emendation is possible, I think it is wrong. Clement almost never hyphenates the name of a god or goddess. Another emendation21 has been to read Oe/odqs for OqIt8o6. This latter emendation seems most unlikely. My own study of the manuscripts leads me to reject the emendations and prefer the original reading. Difficulties with reading Themis disappear in the light of such evidence as the Tiibingen skyphos and the possibility that the Alexandrian procession may have included three different sets of mysteries.22 This does not discount the '~The chief manuscript is Parisinus Graecus 451. A description may be found in GCS 52 (15). '"Claude Mond6sert, Clement d'Alexandrie, Le Protreptique (Paris: Cerf, 1949). 20These probabilities are founded on a study of manuscript errors in the textual tradition of Aeschylos. 21For some of these suggestions see Ehrenburg, Rechtsidee, 33-36. 22Aeschylos (Prometheus, 211) refers to the union of Ge and Themis: iAo' 6' AAlrrlp obX 6rraeAO' 6Vo' O ill Kat I'aa, rrothhXw0 6 ao-&amp;rwv Aop 1 g a.</page><page sequence="8">80 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW possibility that Clement may have combined the two goddesses in his thought. For scholars now recognize that the ancient goddess F- remained important through Hellenistic times.23 Porphyry (Abstin. 2,23) says that rF must be praised and loved as the common mother of all. Clement himself follows this convention, although in an ironic mode. For he speaks of rI as the common mother of iron and bronze, the material of images of the gods.24 The second group of textual problems involves the words app/rra and d7rdb r ra. The former term is used by Clement to describe the mysteries of Rhea-Kybele.25 This is probably the force of the j'-q ro-o mentioned among the mothers of Dionysos (Plutarch, Caesar 9). The names of Rhea and Demeter alternate in the myths. This tradition would certainly be something "unutterable" for Clement. The other symbols in the first two sets of mysteries might also qualify in Clement's thinking for this adjective. He seems to use it regularly in such contexts and in the sense of "unutterable" or "unspeakable."26 Clement uses a'r'd j5jrog with the same consistency in the sense of "what is not to be revealed." Thus it would be a proper adjective for the Hiera of the mysteries. If we accept the manuscript reading and take the adjective a'dropp?7rog with the symbols associated with Themis, we have more evidence for the survival of a primitive ritual. Clement implies that the symbols of the first two classes of mysteries are "unspeakable," but that they are not necessarily Hiera of the mysteries. Symbols associated with Themis, however, apparently did have in Clement's thought a mystery connotation. We should note, however, that Clement in all likelihood was not familiar with the actual rites. For the evidence regarding the XLKVOV would lead to the conclusion that the symbols in the basket were not hidden at all. There seems to be further evidence of their public character. 23Cf. Karl Kerenyi, Zeus und Hera (Leiden: Brill, 1972) 88, 95. 24Protrep. 4,50; 5,56. 25Hesiod in the Theogony pictures Demeter as daughter and mother standing between Rhea and Persephone. An Orphic genealogy shows how later theologians may have tried to combine different traditions. According to one tradition Rhea was the mother of Persephone; according to another, it is Demeter. Following the first tradition Persephone bore by her own father the subterranean child Dionysos as a second, subterranean Zeus. 26The names of both Demeter and Persephone are used for the mother of the child. Orphic Fragment 145 reads: "After becoming the mother of Zeus, she who had formerly been Rhea became Demeter." This tradition would be "unutterable" for Clement.</page><page sequence="9">LOUIS ROBERTS 81 IV. Possible New Evidence The public nature of the lamp and the sword does not need demonstration. Their obvious connection with Themis as goddess of righteousness has lasted throughout western culture. The public character of the more controversial symbols needs to be considered. The first piece of evidence is a Phrygian grave relief27 which pictures an inverted basket with contents spilling out onto a v- shaped ribbon from which stylized tendrils hang. Scattered about the relief are various symbols, some of which have an obvious phallus shape; and there is also a stylized alabastron. In addition there is what seems definitely to be a portrayal of a KT~19 yvvalLKeTos, with some stylization to suggest a comb. The objects which seem to be falling directly from the basket are round and may be fruits but may also stand for 6plyavov. The second bit of evidence is a fragment of Callimachos (Fr. 343, 136, Ki, 308 Schn.): aib6' oLULJY it KTEV0S9 U OKOv ie4e pats. Pfeiffer28 believed that this fragment refers only to "hair" and not to the pudenda. He refused to combine it with Fragment 543. I suggest that this refusal simply reflects the Puritanism which caused other references as well as the whole Callimachos poem to disappear during the Christian period. Callimachos in Ep. 27 uses the verb 04pw in the sense of growing warm from erotic passion. Three other sources suggest reference to al6oTov.29 Thus Clement does not seem to reveal anything which could not have been known elsewhere to the uninitiated. If there is evidence for public knowledge of the two symbols, and if we can assume a long association of the sword and lamp (symbolic of justice) with Themis, in what sense are these sym- bols drrb77ra? Symbols for Clement are related to referents. The first two classes of symbols give little direct information about their referents and in addition are trivial in Clement's view of the world. The third class of symbols, however, do have a conventional and natural relation to Themis, who was often connected with Demeter.30 Apuleius (Metam. 6.2) mentions the 27Calder, Monumenta Asiae Minoris Antiquae (Manchester: University, 1963) 6, 53, 299. 28Rudolf Pfeiffer, Callimachus (Cambridge: Oxford, 1949) 1. 292. 29Cf. ibid., 292, 293 for references to other texts. 30Callimachos (Dem. Hymn 18) cites as first point in praise of the goddess how she gave r(dLta to cities. This Hymn begins with the phrase, "When the kalathos passes." Callimachos in Fragment 63 associates Demeter (Deo) with the</page><page sequence="10">82 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW secrets of the baskets which are to be kept quiet (per tacita secreta cistarum . . . et cetera quae silentio tegit Eleusinis Atticae sacrarium). This accords with what we have noted in Vergil. When we combine these bits of evidence, a conclusion emerges that Clement is operating within a convention in his use of drrp6j-rlroq. The phrase da6/qrmra u ip4okXa was a stock usage connected with the mysteries. The symbols were probably well known. The moralism of succeeding centuries would account for the few remaining references. Clement, therefore, does not unveil any new information. What he does provide is important evidence for the role of Themis in the early Christian era. He supports the theories of Farnell and Ehrenburg. The religious expectation and needs of the time brought about combination of rites and symbols from originally different mysteries and processions. Clement was unsympathetic about the piety of the devotee of Themis or Demeter. These goddesses were given responsibility for preserving order in both political and natural spheres. Thesmophoria and explains by the anger of the goddess why some things must not be revealed. The end of the Hymn prays to the goddess for two gifts: justice and fertility. Pausanias (5, 14, 30) stresses that at Olympia the altar of Ge was named the "Mouth of Themis," and the Orphic Hymn to Demeter (40, 18-23) unites the functions of fertility and justice.</page></plain_text>
