<plain_text><page sequence="1">Toward a Naturalistic "Non-Naturalistic" Ethic by MAY BRODBECK UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA HUME showed, not apparently once and for all but in a manner his pos- terity has been unable to ignore, that normative judgments cannot be de- rived from non-normative judgments. G. E. Moore, in a different but equally compelling manner, reminded our generation of essentially the same thing. Since then, whatever other fringes of meaning the phrase may have, "naturalism in ethics" has meant at least the view that ethical terms</page><page sequence="2">8 PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES are in some sense reducible to or definable in terms of nonethical ones or, what amounts to the same, that ethical statements are derivable from nonethical statements. Since Moore, the "naturalists" have been on the defensive. While rejecting his primary thesis that "good" is indefinable, they have ingeniously invented various devices to circumvent the "natural- istic fallacy." However, those naturalists who have taken seriously Moore's charge hiave rested their case on either a highly dubious theory of meaning that distills out of the significant core of ethical judgments a "merely" emotive evanescence which, like the epiphenomenalist's mind, happens to accom- pany the meaningful but does not contribute to it; or else on an equally questionable hypothesis regarding human motivation, implying that the occurrence of an ethical judgment is invariably accompanied by reformist zeal. Fruitful as the discussion centering around these views has been, it seems to me that in the end they have done little more than prove the strength of the opponents' position. For Hume and Moore, each in his own way with his own characteristic limitations, were right. Hume stressed the correct logic of the matter, Moore the facts of experience. For it is a fact that when I experience something as ethically good, I experience it as ethically good,' not as, say, pleasant, just as it is a fact that when I experience something as red, I experience red, not hotness. Nor am I, when I feel that something is my duty, really just afraid that I am going to be punished if I don't do it, any more than when I experience three-dimensional space I am really making an inference from a two-dimen- sional percept plus tactual and kinesthetic cues. In the latter case, I origi- nally learn by these means to experience the dimension of depth, but once having learned this, it becomes "second-nature," that is, I experience it directly. And so it is with the moral imperatives and the so-called tertiary or ethical qualities. I am conditioned in childhood to believe that there are some things I ought to do and others I ought not, if I want to reap rewards or escape punishment. After a time, by a devious psychological process, the hypo- thetical imperative becomes phenomenally categorical. Like depth, it is now directly given, but the urgency is from within. And a similar analysis holds for moral qualities. By a complex process of association, some things come to have the quality of good or bad. Since this quality arises from a combination of interacting inner and outer factors, it may reasonablv be called emergent or resultant. All that this so far amounts to, of course, is an appeal to inspection plus a rough sketch of what a scientific explanation of the results of this in- spection would look like. Without trying to press the evidence of my introspection on others, I want only to consider what are the consequences of acknowledging that there is such a thing as moral experience sui generis.</page><page sequence="3">A NATURALISTIC "NON-NATURALISTIC" ETHIC 9 For I do believe that the attempts to deny that there is stem largely from misunderstanding and consequent apprehension, not to say panic, about what we are committed to, if we accept what Moore and most traditional moralists have insisted upon. Empiricists have feared that to admit the direct experience of obligation or the givenness of good (the interesting question about the relation between the two does not materially affect my argument) would of necessity lead to (a) the view that moral qualities are objective rather than subjective in the ordinary sense of those words; therefore (b) the acceptance of nonempirical, intuitive knowledge and (c) an absolutistic doctrine of moral judgments. While these fears are per- haps not without some historical justification, they are nevertheless with- out logical ground, since none of these things follows from the recognition of the phenomenal givenness or the unique nature of moral experience. Suppose we hold "good" to be an immediately given quality in the way in which the sense qualities are so given. Need one resort to some special kind of existence known in some special way? In particular, need we ac- cept a presentative realism of the intuitional variety? The belief that, given the premise, these questions must be answered in the affirmative is the implicit non sequitur that bedevils much of present empiricist thinking in ethics.2 If "good" is an immediately perceived quality of a thing or, more likely, complex of things, this is entirely explainable in terms of the psychological facts about conditioning mentioned earlier. Granting this much, it is evident that the analogy with sense qualities like color is far from complete. Two significant differences appear. 1. Under standard conditions all observers with norinal vision see the same color. This is so because such observers by definition all have the same physiological-neurological apparatus; therefore their reaction to the same physical stimulus, light rays of a specified wave length, will be the same. In the case of "good," however, the response to the physical stimulus will depend upon previous psychological training. It follows that what is phe- nomenally given to one person may not be to another. One criterion of the objective, intersubjectivity, would therefore not be satisfied by the tertiary qualities. And even if everyone were given the same conditioning, so that they responded uniformly, this would still not put "good" on a par with "red," since the moral response is dependent on learning in a way in which the color response is not. In the latter case what is learned is a linguistic matter, the correct name for the response, not the response itself. 2. Furthermore, there is a difference in ontological status. Consider the trained observer who sees what the neophyte misses, or those puzzle pic- tures witlh hidden faces. In these cases there is something really out there, but which we may not notice until it is called to our attention. Goodness is not there in the same sense as, say, the barely perceptible yellow tint of the patient's cornea or as the camouflaged visages. Moral training is not</page><page sequence="4">10 PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES a process of alerting the moral sense to perceive what exists independently but, in an untutored state, is overlooked. Then does goodness exist? A direct answer cannot be given. If the truth of "Something is q" implies "4S exists" and goodness, per hypothesis, is a simple quality, then it exists. But this is not and cannot be the whole story or else good and red have the same status. Yet, the causal considerations in paragraph 1 have already shown that they do not. The point, as I see it, is this. If, on a pre-analytic level, we are merely describing the flow of our experience, then good is a simple and "exists" as red does. But, phenomenology is only the beginning and not the end of philosophical analysis. A complete reconstruction relating the immedi- ately given to the rest of our knowledge would reflect the difference be- tween these predicates which we not only feel exists but which scientific considerations impress upon us. In Moore's terminologv a nonintrinsic property of an experience is one which "it is quite conceivable that that experience should not have had."3 ln this sense of the term, I suggest that an empiricist who holds "good" to be indefinable would also maintain that goodness is not an intrinsic property while red is. Or, again in Moore's terms, "red" would be neces- sary for a complete description of a thing while "good" would not. But an account of experience just as it occurs would not in itself indicate this distinction. For the data do not come labeled. Only after analysis is it clear that good and red stand in different relations to the objects of which they are properties. And this is the only sense in which good can be said to be "non-natural." But on this usage, "pleasant," "funny," "awesome," and "fearful" may also be said to refer to non-natural properties of things. And, indeed, goodness is in the same class as these when they are viewed as properties of things.4 Accordingly, I would agree with Frankena that the "naturalistic fallacy" is more properly a "definist" fallacy, according to which the error lies not in confusing ethical predicates with "natural" ones, but simply in identifying two things which are different.' The distinction between "natural" and "non-natural" within an em- piricist framework is, to be sure, a very Pickwickian terminology. But as long as, following phenomenal cues and their reflection in grammatical usage, we speak of goodness and, say, fearfulness as properties of objects, then this is perhaps not a bad shorthand way of calling attention to post- analytic distinctions. Admittedly, to call these, without further analysis, "properties" courts the most elementary anthropomorphism. On the other lhand, to do so with the proper precautionary analysis only does justice to the texture of experience. It follows, therefore, that recognition of the fact, if it is a fact, of the immediate experience of good does not entail its objective existence or, ipso facto, absolutism and the need for intuitive knowledge.</page><page sequence="5">ONTOLOGY AND IDEOLOGY 11 If moral experience is discussed in terms of the uniqueness of the impera- tive, instead of the quality, a similar analysis holds. Either the psycho- analytic or behavioristic accounts of the development of the superego or conscience illustrate genetic explanations of moral experience in the impera- tive mood. They provide empirical explanations which, if true, account for the facts and do not lead to any undesirable metaphysic about the nature of standards and our conformance to them. An analysis of the kind liere presented is thus "non-naturalistic" in the narrower meaning that term has come to have in ethical discussion-insistence upon the inde- finability of the moral predicates-yet naturalistic in the broader sense of not admitting extranatural realms of being or ways of knowing. Clearly, it is not necessary to deny some fairly obvious facts of human experience in order to deny objective reality to values.6 NOTES That I do not use "good" to mean "intrinsically good" and why I do not will be- come clear in the sequel. But "good" is a one-term predicate, not a relation. 'This point has been made by Gustav Bergmann.
