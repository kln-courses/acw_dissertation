<plain_text><page sequence="1">WORLD VIEW AND THE MONOLITHIC TEMPLES OF MALINALCO, MEXICO : ICONOGRAPHY AND ANALOGY IN PRE-COLUMBIAN ARCHITECTURE by Ruben G. MENDOZA The Cosmic Archetypes 1. Throughout Mesoamerica, refinements in the arts of sculpture and ceramics were to evolve in conjunction with a highly sophisticated symbolism, which would in turn establish the basis for the development of cosmological models. These cosmological models, or archetypes, were to be symbolized by many cultures, yet the development of archetypes symbolizing complete world plan configurations was not to encounter the refined technical sophistication which emerged in the post-Classic period. The Aztec, whose monumental works continue to amaze the world, were responsible for having developed a highly complex cosmological scheme whose solar cults would necessitate an array of rituals which were intended to appease the complexities of a dynamic universe. " It is logical therefore that the Nahuas, trained in the observation of phenomena and advanced in their knowledge of mathematics, astronomy, and chronology, should have developed an extraordinary cosmology, cons tructing a complex mythological system for symbolic explanation " (Leôn Portilla, 1963 : 28). Among the Aztec, sculptural works related to world view were to find sym bolic expression in monolithic monuments dedicated to the preservation of the knowledge regarding the cosmic order. Monuments such as the Aztec goddess of the universe, Coatlicue (see Fernandez, 1966, 1972), or the mono 1. According to Carl Jung (1964 : 57-58), " the term " archetype " is often misunderstood as meaning certain definite mythological images or motifs. But these are nothing more than conscious representations ; it would be absurd to assume that such variable representation could be inherited Furthermore, Jung states that " the archetype is a tendency to form such representations of a motif — representations that can vary a great deal in detail without losing their basic pattern</page><page sequence="2">64 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES lith commemorating the inauguration of the " Templo Mayor " of Tenochtit lan, " el Teocalli de la Guerra Sagrada " (Marquina, 1964), incorporate or exhi bit elements relevant to cosmic archetypes. Iconography has revealed the symbolic nature of many pre-Columbian monuments, and has proven to be a recurrent topic in the literature (e. g. Nicholson, 1976). The elements of symbolism present in many post-Classic central Mexican monuments have revealed, in a symbolic context, complete archetypes related to post-Classic Weltanschauung or world view. Yet the iconographie examination of temple structures in Mesoamerica, in terms of cosmological archetypes, has been neglec ted. If we are to take into consideration the interacting factors involved in determinants of world view and architectural planning, and their inherent inter relationships, the implications of studying world-plan as manifest in architec ture becomes of paramount significance. This paper presents an iconographie examination of an architectural monument in relationship to world-plan consi derations as encountered in the structural composition of the monolithic temples of Malinalco, Mexico. The objective of the current research is to define the symbolic nature of the temple structure in relationship to cosmological models of the Central Highlands. It must be pointed out that the iconographie interpretation of architectural symbolism is inevitably based upon general interpretation of symbolism from the Nahua culture area, and is not restricted to any one complete cosmologi cal system. In attempting to establish the basis of the " cosmic archetype ", it is necessary to view varied symbolic systems of the cultural groups being analyzed. As is stated by Nicholson (1971 : 403), " no clear-cut, comprehen sive native account of the conception of the universe which prevailed in late pre-Hispanic Central Mexico has been preserved, but its general outlines can be reconstructed from various sources ". Hence, in dealing with the cosmo logical systems of Mesoamerica, a limiting factor is the fragmentary nature of these cosmological models. The sources utilized will deal primarily with the central Mexican region, and specifically with the Aztec culture sphere. The use of ethnographic and ethnohistoric analogy is justified on the basis " that there is a sufficient degree of ideological continuity... between all the different local and temporal manifestations of Mesoamerican civilization " to warrant such analogy (Fürst, 1974 : 199). The site of Malinalco, which lies in the valley of a rugged and mountainous region of the state of Mexico, approximately one hundred and eighteen kilo meters south of Mexico City, is a site whose principal structure illustrates a complete, or nearly complete, temple structural construct and symbolic com position. The reason that the sculptural motifs can be presumed intact is that the entire temple, sculptural features and symbolic motifs, was hewn from the living-rock of a sheer granite cliff, one hundred and twenty-five meters above the valley floor. The principal construction, known as the Cuauhcalli or Eagle House, incor porates an intact symbolic composition of zoomorphic, anthropomorphic, and personalized forms which, in combination, form a symbolic network. Among the motifs are to be encountered works which are readily identifiable as symbols relevant to Nahua cosmological thought (Payon, 1958).

In dealing with the monolithic temple structure of Malinalco, we are inevi tably confronted by an array of symbolic forms derived from the socio-cultural setting. These elements of symbolism, in the initial observation, appear to have no definitive conceptual interrelationship. Yet, if we view these sym bols in their socio-cultural context, we are confronted by the militaristic nature of the site. In analyzing the elements of symbolism present in the monuments framework, we are exposed to elements associated with two militaristic orders, these being, the militaristic order of the eagle and that of the ocelotl (in ocelotl in cuahtli). The eagle and the ocelotl, being the mascots of the respective militaristic orders in question, attained a semi-divine aspect in the eyes of the warrior-priest. In viewing the ritual function of the monuments at Malinalco we are confron ted by descriptions of constructions in the central Mexican area, resembling those of Malinalco, involving ceremonies documented by the European chro niclers. The social structure of the Aztec was heavily infiltrated by militaris tic ideologies intricately intermeshed with theological and philosophical concepts. The Aztec developed the concept of a " sacred war ", the function of which was aimed at the acquisition of sacrificial captives. Many of the monuments of the Aztec centre of Tenochtitlan were constructed in accordance with con ceptions and practices associated with the ceremonial wars of the Aztec. The primary significance of the war lies in the fact that the war was conceived of as symbolically replicating the cosmic struggle. The term Atl-tlachinolli signifies the merging of fire and water in cosmic union and, in a similar vein, the " sacred war " enacted such a conceptualization (Séjourné, 1956 : 105). The " sacred war " involved mock battles between the Aztec and the Tlaxca lan, among others, in which prisoners taken in battle were destined for the blood drenched altars of the opposing force. As is stated by Alma Reed (1966 : 130), " in the era preceding the Conquest Tlaxcala had been involved in an almost continuous state of siege ". Likewise, Harner (1977 : 51) states that the Aztecs " failure " to consolidate conquest in the Old World fashion puzzled Cor tez, who asked Moctezuma to explain why he allowed the surrounded Tlaxcalans to maintain their independence. Moctezuma reportedly replied that his people could thus obtain captives for sacrifice. The warriors who participated in the sacred war, were known as the qua quauhtin (eagles). According to the early chronicles of post-Conquest Mexico, these warriors " united in a place created especially for them, which was known as the Quauhcalli, or " Eagle House ", in which they served the image of the sun who was their patron saint " (Torrez, 1975 : 79). The chronicler Sahagun recorded the names and titles of various individuals involved in the Atl-tlachi nolli, of these, the leaders were known as the Tonatiuh itlatocan, or " men of the sun ". Every participant in the sacred war was designated with a title or titles which were conceptually relative to the overall symbolic function of the war. In relation to the structural composition of the motifs encountered in the symbolic framework of the Eagle House, the portrayals of the eagle and</page><page sequence="6">WORLD VIEW AND THE MONOLITHIC TEMPLES OF MALINALCO 67 jaguar knights are clearly associated with the purpose of the Atl-tlachinolli. The eagle and ocelotl were symbols of varied world view concepts, but in asso ciation with the warriors mission the two militaristic orders, that of the eagle and of the ocelotl, were representatives of the celestial warrior, the Sun. Like wise, as is stated by Nigel Davies (1973 : 190), " apart from their leading role in the gladiatorial sacrifice, it seems that in war they fought as a separate body, or a corps d'élite In order to gain a clearer understanding of the ritual function of the monu ments at Malinalco, it is necessary to look at conquest period chronicles which illustrate the purposes and functions of ritual constructions of central Mexico. Likewise, the symbolism, architectural monuments, and cosmological systems are hereby synthesized in conjunction with the concept of the cosmic archetype, or model. Those elements of ritual symbolism encountered within the frame work of the temple are manifest reflections of the socio-cultural context. As is stated by Francis Huxley, in " The Way of the Sacred ", the " temple is a space cut out of reality in such a way that what happens within its frameworks can be read as an indication of what must happen outside. The problem for its builder is to find a combination of geometrical forms that will make the corres pondence between God, man, and nature visible and comprehensible. To achieve this, all classical systems have employed a harmonic scheme based on proportion — a scheme that allows dissimilar things to be put together and that can be applied to number, rhythm, music, symbolism, and indeed the growth of living things " (1976 : 170-171). In the following sections, an attempt will be made to illustrate aspects rele vant to the ritual symbolism and cosmological systems of the central Mexican highlands, as well as interacting factors in determinants of architectural plan ning and construction. Numerical Symbolism and Temple Construction. In the cosmologies of the ancient Mexicans, the universe was generally sub divided into distinct cosmic levels. Each level of the celestial construct was indicated by a god, an animal, but principally by numerical symbolism (Henry B. Nicholson, personal communication). The use of numerology, or sacred numerical concepts, was an integral aspect of the belief systems of the pre Columbian peoples of Middle America. Many of the numerological systems of ancient Mexico were intricately tied to calendrical systems, which were in turn associated with the movement of the stars and planets (Caso 1967). The ancient Mexicans obsession with numerology led to the establishment of the Tonalpohualli, or sacred calendar count, which was the alterego of the solar cycle. The use of numerology in the sacred count, predestined the fate of life, and therefore was to be taken into account when dealing with the gods Leôn-Portilla, 1963 : 21). The use of numerology was of such import, that the monuments created by the ancient Mexicans rarely lack some form of numeri cal symbolism. Hence, as is evident, the significance of numbers was of great importance to the theistic aspects, as well as calendrical considerations of the</page><page sequence="7">Xu x» w -ra- ffÜ s I tm £§&gt;\&lt;|L v» Vrt IX v'lH V« Ml V w iTt fsss^n TOT J vu ^5^ Diagram 2. — The 13 Celestial and 9 Terrestrial Tiers.

So too, in dealing with the symbolic function of temple structures in Mesoamerica, the placement of symbolic elements, the number of platforms or steps in the monuments structural framework, and other consi derations must be taken into account when delving into numerical symbolism as manifest in architecture. Monumental structures at such post-Classic period sites as Cempoala, Tepoz tlan, Malinalco, and others, incorporate stairways composed of steps in series of thirteen. The concept regarding the numeral thirteen is embodied in the belief that the universe was thought to consist of a series of thirteen celestial tiers. One may question the symbolic relationships between a universe with thriteen ascending levels, and a monolithic temple incorporating thriteen ascen ding steps. If we are to view these concepts iconographically, or in relation to studies of sculptural symbolism, we have sufficient evidence to indicate that monuments, such as the monolithic sculpture of the goddess Coatlicue, incor porate symbolic numerical concepts into their overall framework (Fernandez, 1972). The goddess is a symbolic representation of the universe, and incor porates symbols indicative of Nahua world-plan. So too, Coatlicue incorpo rates numerological symbolism relative to world-plan perceptions. Aside from multiple representations of duality, the numerical concept relative to the num ber thirteen plays a vital role. For in the case of Coatlicue, the serpent skirt of the goddess is backed by a sculptural composition of thirteen braided strands of human flesh which have been identified in relation to the concept of the exis tence of thirteen celestial levels in the Nahua world-plan construct. So too, Dr. Ignacio Bernai, of the Mexican National Museum of Anthropology, has suggested a study of the commemorative monument known as the " Teocalli de la Guerra Sagrada " (Ignacio Bernai, personal communication). This monu mental work, which was sculpted to commemorate the erection of the great temple of Tenochtitlan, incorporates a wealth of cosmologically relevant sym bolism. Aside from depictions of gods such as Tlaltecuhtli, the Earth Monster ; Huitzilopochtli, the solar deity ; or Tezcatlipoca, as a manifestation of the quadripartite conception of the universe ; the monument incorporates a sym bol of the solar disk at the summit of a staircase which is composed of thir teen steps. In a symbolic sense, one can envision the ascent of the solar disk through the thirteen tiers of the celestial vault with its ascent to the zenith and subsequent descent into the bowels of the earth monster depicted at the summit of the staircase. Inevitably, this is an iconographie interpretation, though based on symbolic interpretations of documented world view concepts. Hence, the inclusion of the numerical concept of the thirteen levels as presen ted in the stairways composition, is relevant to the overall structure of the temple archetype presented in the commerorative monument. The intricate nature of Nahua numerological symbolism is seen manifested in stairway construction at the site of Malinalco. The principal staircase of the Cuauhcalli incorporates thirteen steps which are iconographically relative to the concept of the thirteen celestial tiers which comprised the Nahua world view construct. According to H. B. Nicholson (1971 : 406-407), an authority on Mexican symbolism, these levels were " intimately associated with a series</page><page sequence="9">70 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES of thirteen deities who ruled over successive Tonalpohualli days in a repetitive cyclic sequence ". The sophisticated nature of the numerological system combines with calen drical concepts in an ingenious composition of stairways and platforms. The rock-cut staircase which lies to the eastern side of the principal construction is composed of four complementary tiers, each tier of which incorporates thir teen steps. The uppermost tier, which is all but obliterated, would hypothe tically appear to incorporate the thirteen steps although erosion has taken its toll. Nonetheless, three of the platforms incorporate well defined stairway compositions structured on the basis of numerological symbolism relative to the concept regarding the number thirteen. Assuming that all four plat forms incorporate thirteen steps, the sum total of which is equivalent to fifty two ascending steps, the concept of the Tonalpohualli (or sacred calendar) becomes evident. The sacred calendar involved a cyclic sequence of fifty two years which was symbolically representative of the Nahua concept of cosmic duration, termination, and rebirth (Caso, 1967 : 77). According to the Aztec chronicles, the world had been created and destroyed four times in a succession of catastrophic events which terminated the existence of four previous cosmogonie epochs (Krickeberg, 1956 : 128). In other words, to the Aztec the culmination of each cycle symbolically represented the termination or possible destruction of the current cosmogonie epoch. So too, at the end of the cycle, the Aztec held a fire ceremony in conjunction with the destruction of artifacts, and the construction as well as destruction, of temples superim posing older monuments (Krickeberg, 1956 : 114). Temple superimposition took on a prominent aspect at the end of the calendrical cycle of the Tonalpo hualli, which was in itself symbolic of superimposed cosmic epochs which were terminated by catastrophic events (Reed, 1966 : 60). The destruction of temples at the end of the Tonalpohualli cycle takes on symbolic significance when viewed in light of the fact that the temple is an archetype of conceptual dimen sions associated with Nahua world-plan considerations. Hence, temple destruc tion and structural platform composition and superimposition are relevant to aspects associated with extant relationships between architecture and world plan. Among the architectural features to be encountered at the site of Malinalco are the superimposition of temple platforms, and circular construction tech niques which present, covert manifestations of architectural symbolism. In general, most temple constructions of central Mexico incorporate from two to five platforms in the structural framework. From the chronicles regarding the existence of a monumental construction at the site of Texcoco, it appears evident that symbolism of a cosmological nature was to be encountered in temple platform composition as relative to concepts regarding the twenty-two tiered celestial construct of the ancient Mexicans (Nicholson, 1971 : 407). According to the chronicler Ixtlilxochitl (1892, vol. II : 227), Nezahualcoyotl, the ruler of Texcoco, ordered the construc tion of a massive temple " fronting and opposite the great temple of Huitzilo pochtli. The pyramid had four platforms which served as the base for a very high tower. This tower had nine stages which signified the nine heavens</page><page sequence="10">WORLD VIEW AND THE MONOLITHIC TEMPLES OF MALINALCO 71 (cycles). The shrine on the tenth stage of the tower served as a sort of pinnacle for the nine floors below. This shrine was painted black and decorated with stars on the outside, while inside it was covered with gold, precious stones and colorful feather works. Here the Unknown and Unseen, the Uncreated, who had no statue, was honored and adored ". The Celestial Pyramid. According to various iconographers of Mexican symbolism, it is believed that the ancient Mexicans conceived of a universe in the form of a celestial pyramid (Torrez, 1975 : 29). 1. Xluhtecuhtli 2.

Citlaiicue Diagram 3. —- An illustration of the concept regarding the " Celestial Pyramid The numbers indicate the concepts and deities associated with each of the " 13 " levels of the celestial realm. (After Torrez 1975). As is stated by Henri Stierlin (1968 : 177) : this system stems from a concept peculiar to the cosmology of central Mexico, according to which the universe consisted of two inverted pyramids, their bases touching one another. The upper pyramid represents our world, and the lower — its summit loca ted in the Antipodes — the next world. During the day, the sun scales one side of the first pyramid, reaching the summit at noon ; it then descends along the other side. During the night, the process is reversed : the sun descends to the ' opposite ' summit and rises towards the horizon (the base). The constructions at such sites as Cempoala, in Veracruz, incorporate the symbolic framework alluded to by proponents of the theory of the " celestial pyramid ". The principal temple structure of Cempoala incorporates thir teen ascending platform levels. If we are to relate this to the thirteen tiered celestial construct, we have each level symbolizing variations of the Nahua world-plan. Similarly, Edward Seler, the late German monographer of Mexi can symbolism, defined each level of the celestial construct in terms of the dei ties and world view aspects associated with each respective level. If we are</page><page sequence="11">72 SOCIETE DES AMERICANISTES to define levels of the celestial construct from an iconographie perspective, it is necessary to define each respective level in relation to the attributes of the elements associated with those levels in question. In viewing the structural framework of the Eagle House at Malinalco, it is to be observed that the temple incorporates a dual platform composition. If we are to view the platform composition of the Cuauhcalli in relation to the concept of the " celestial pyramid ", we find the temple associated with Tlaltecuhtli, the Earth Monster, the symbolic basis of the Nahua universe and representative of the second level of the celestial construct (Torrez, 1975 : 31). The Matlatzincan Cave Cult. The Matlazinca who inhabited the area in and about the valley of Malinalco, prior and subsequent to the Aztec domination of the valley in 1476, developed a vast theo-philosophical concept related to Tlaltecuhtli, the cavern-dwelling Earth Monster. The reptilian image of Tlaltecuhtli is seen replicated in the form of the entrance to the sanctuary which is composed of the gaping jaws of the " Earth Monster ". The manifestation of Tlaltecuhtli, as a gigantic, crouching, toadlike monster, with a teethstudded mouth (Nicholson, 1971 : 406), is an architectural motif which is seen replicated in other ritual construc tions throughout Mesoamerica. It is interesting to note that the European chroniclers recorded the appearance of a temple which was presumably dedi cated to Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl in the Aztec centre of Tenochtitlan, whose, entrance was like the mouth of a serpent and it was painted diabolically. The fangs and teeth were in relief and it staggered those who entered, especially if they were Christians, who thought they were facing the gates of hell... (Payon, 1958 : 23). The gaping jaws of the Earth Monster become significantly obvious when viewed in relation to the symbolic aspects of the sanctuary. The gaping jaws of Tlaltecuhtli symbolize the caverns of the earth, which were in turn, " sym bols of creation, of life itself... The cave was, and still is, highly revered as the womb of the earth, especially if there is a spring in it, inasmuch as life-giving water also springs from the maternal womb " (Heyden, 1975 : 134). The caves association with the maternal womb, as with origin myths, evidently correlates with the concept of dynamic creation. Likewise, Tlaltecuhtli, as Earth Monster, was considered the " genitrix of all life,... whose womb receives the bones and souls of the dead " (Fürst, 1974 : 195). It is interesting to note that throughout the valley of Mexico, as elsewhere, ceremonial centres are to be encountered in close proximity to natural caverns. At times, as in the case of monuments to be encountered at such sites as Texcotzingo, Tenoch titlan, and Tepoztlan, we have the creation of artificial caverns to supplement the ceremonial environ, in association with the cult of Tlaltecuhtli. The cavern has undoubtably presented a very powerful supernaturalistic aura to the peoples of Middle America and has inevitably been the subject of many a scholarly endeavor (e. g., Andrews 1970). The cavern was generally considered the door to communication with the supernatural realm of the</page><page sequence="12">WORLD VIEW AND THE MONOLITHIC TEMPLES OF MALINALCO 73 • •• Diagram 4. — The authors rendition of the entrance to the sanctuary of the " Eagle House Depicted are the gaping jaws of the Earth Monster, Tlaltecuhtli, who alternately devours and regurgitates the light of the Sun. (Insert : in the lower righthand corner is depicted a representation of Tlaltecuhtli as found in the Codex Borbonicus. Note similarity to the relief at Malinalco). Earth Lord (Vogt, 1976 : 16-17). Likewise, the cave was looked upon as the shamans doorway to the acquisition of esoteric knowledge. It was believed that within the cave dwelt the nahual, or alter-ego of the individual, and as in the case of the monument of Malinalco, it appears likely that the flayed skins of the eagle and jaguar within the sanctuary, symbolize diverse manifes tations of the nahual. According to Peter T. Fürst, in Hallucinogens and Culture (1976 : 48), the jaguar was closely identified with the shaman, and was in many instance " the avatar of living or deceased shamans, containing their souls and doing good or evil in accordance with the disposition of their human form ". As the tutelary guardians of the shaman, the representations of jaguar to the exterior of Malinalco's principal construction, appear to conform to the notion of an avatar, as described by Fürst (1976).</page><page sequence="13">74 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES Earth-Sun : In Tonatiuh In Tlaltecuhtli *. The representation of the gaping jaws of Tlaltecuhtli apparently conforms to the concept regarding cosmologies which explain the transit of the sun in terms of its consumption and regurgitation by the Earth Monster. Similarly, the symbols of the flayed skins of eagle and jaguar are relative to conceptions regarding the solar deity in its transitory state from the nocturnal jaguar to the celestial eagle, as well as its birth and emergence from caverns (Heyden, 1975 : 134). f II a t=&amp;=| - j &lt; Diagram 5. — The author's hypothetical reconstruction of the " Eagle House Note the spatial placement of symbolism, as well as the dual platform composition of the monument. The jaguar and eagle knights are to be encountered to the left and right sides of the sanctua ries entrance. (Reconstruction based on personal observation, and Marquina 1964). According to Nicholson (1971 : 406), Tlaltecuhtli was " believed to swallow the sun in the evening, disgorging it each dawn, also devouring the blood and hearts of sacrificed victims and the souls of the dead in general Therefore, as is evident, the existence of Tlaltecuhtli as a symbol of the caverns of the earth and devourer of the sun is a relevant aspect to the cosmological system. Furthermore, the depictions of the eagle and jaguar at Malinalco, as previously mentioned, are symbols of the solar deity. According to the chronicles, there existed a series of animal and bird forms which served as manifestations of the sun at various points in its transit (Nicholson, 1971 : 406-7). These zoo morphic forms can be likened to the concept of the nahual, wherein the solar deity takes on the guise of the creature capable of aiding its transit. The creatures most representative of the ultimate ideals and forces of the earth 2. Sahagun, 1969.</page><page sequence="14">WORLD VIEW AND THE MONOLITHIC TEMPLES OF MALINALCO 75 and sky, were the jaguar and the eagle, respectively. Hence, the transforma tions of the solar deity from a celestial eagle, to the terrestrial jaguar, and vice versa, corresponds to the concepts associated with the dominant zoomorphic forms of heaven and earth. In the Aztec cosmologies, the cardinal points were associated with varied concepts and deities. The southern cardinal point was associated with Huit zilopochtli, or " Hummingbird Left ", who traversed the cosmos atop the xuicoatl, or " fire serpent ". Hence, the fact that the Cuauhcalli, or " Eagle House ", faces the southern cardinal point, corresponds to the concept relative to the temple structure in question, since Huitzilopochtli was the Aztec solar deity, and the " Eagle House " was constructed in honour of the solar cult. The Cuauhcalli, or " Eagle House ", was considered the sancta santorum, which housed the solar visage. As stated by Payon (1958 : 15) in his mono graph on the site of Malinalco. there are six openings in the walls on either side of each sculture within the temple sanctuary. Eighteen stone staples were found during excavation ; they no doubt supported an awning which according to the chronicler Duran, represented the sun. Within the sanctuary are to be encountered, sculpted images of the flayed skins of eagle and jaguar alike. The works, which are hewn from the living rock, are strategically placed to face the midpoint of the sanctuary. Two eagles, and a jaguar, or ocelotl, are placed atop a bench which runs along the wall of the semicircular sanctuary. To the back wall of the sanctuary is to be encountered a jaguar throne which is sculpted to portray the flayed skin of an ocelotl. The ocelotl, aside from being associated with the militaristic order of the " Tiger Knights ", was a symbol of the nocturnal sun which, as previously alluded to, was constantly being devoured and regurgitated by the awesome reptilian toadlike " Earth Monster ". The flayed skin of an eagle is to be encountered to the center of the sanctuary, immediately before an offe rings receptacle, which may have been utilized in conjunction with the sculp ted eagle. The aforementioned receptacle may have been utilized in the cere monial cremation of offerings. It is interesting to note that the receptacle is symbolically placed at the midpoint of the sanctuary, for it was believed that the center of the earth was inhabited by Xiutecuhtli, the " Lord of Fire ", whose abode was the " navel of the earth According to Krickeberg (1956 : 141), Xiutecuhtli symbolized the unification of Heaven and Earth, as well as the fires of the celestial and terrestrial realms. In a symbolic sense, Xiutecuhtli was a manifestation of the eternal fire which generated life. The sacred fire was believed to have imbued the eagle and jaguar with supernatural powers. Likewise, the eagle and the ocelotl, or jaguar, were symbols of bravery ; it will be recalled how, after the creation of the Fifth Sun and Moon, they both plunged into the fire, the eagle emerging completely darkened by the flames, and the ocelotl merely spotted (Davies, 1973 : 190). From the presence of the sacrificial basin and the shape and appearance of the depressed area in the eagle's back, it is probable that human victims were stretched across the work as offerings in human sacrifice. Though human</page><page sequence="15">76 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES sacrifice involved the taking of life, the Aztec viewed the ritual as a generative life-giving force, dedicated to the sustenance of the gods. According to Séjourné (1957 : 30), there is no doubt that the cosmic need for human sacrifice was an ideal slogan, for in its name they [the Aztec] could wage innumerable wars which made up their history and consolidated their reign of terror. Circular Groundplan. 3 As is stated by Huxley (1974 : 187), the circle is the form of that which has neither beginning nor end, the square is that which measures this movement, and it is on this measure that temples are founded. The sacred nature of the concept of circularity is well illustrated by the sheer number of ceremonial constructions in central Mexico which are based on cir cular groundplan. An excellent example of the circular nature of temple constructions is brought to light in the monuments at Calixtlahuaca, which lie north of Malinalco, near Toluca. The circular nature of temple platforms, or sanctuaries as in the case of the Cuauhcalli, is generally associated with the wind god, Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl (Payon, 1958 : 22). But scholars have overlooked the relation this god has with the establishment of the present cosmogonie epoch through solar reincarnation. According to the cosmologies of the central highlands Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl was the principal generative lifeforce reponsible for launching the faltering Fifth Sun into the heavens. With this, the present cosmogonie epoch was initiated into the fifth solar age. Hence, it is here contended that circular structures in the Nahua culture area, are commemorative monuments to the birth and establishment of the Fifth Sun and cosmogonie epoch, as relative to aspects regarding Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl.

In association with the concept of the war rior, the Mexica believed that the warrior, upon physical death, was reincarna ted as a cosmic warrior in stellar form. It was the mission of the celestial warrior to accompany the solar deity into the depths of the underworld, in the midst of the holocaust which characterized the celestial battlefield. Sculpted tenons to be found incorporated into architecture at Malinalco, as elsewhere, are reputed to symbolize the stars. If it is in fact the case that the so-called " nail heads " or tenons, are stellar representations, then it follows that the tenons are symbolic portrayals of stellar warriors created for placement in context with the temple structures symbolic framework. The concept of warrior reincarnation involved the warriors cremation upon physical death. Cremation was considered the door to physical release, and subsequent stellar reincarnation. Crematory practices involved the construc tion of crematorium platforms supported by wooden poles. The site of Mali nalco incorporates rectangular enclosures hewn from the living rock. These enclosures were evidently utilized in ritual practices, due to the fact that offe rings receptacles are strategically placed immediately before the rectangular enclosures. The significance of the receptacles encountered in conjunction with rectangular enclosures is to be encountered in crematory practices of central Mexico. Among the Aztec, prior to cremation, the heart was extrac ted and placed in a receptacle created for the purpose. The composition of the enclosures in association with receptacles, conforms to ritual practices asso ciated with cremation. Summary. From the iconographie examination of the " Eagle House " at Malinalco, it has been determined that the " Eagle House " incorporates elements of symbolism relevant to the cosmic scheme. As in the case of the iconographie examination of the commemorative monument known as " el Teocalli de la Guerra Sagrada " (Marquina, 1964), the temple incorporates a staircase of thirteen steps which has been shown to correlate with the concepts regarding the pre-Columbian " celestial construct But of significance is the fact that the temple incorporates the necessary symbolic motifs to explain the workings of the Nahua universe. Furthermore, it has been established that (1) the dual platform composition of the Cuauhcalli is relevant to Tlaltecuhtli, the " Earth Monster " ; (2) that the solar deity is symbolized in transit, atop the xuicoatl, or " Fire Serpent " ; (3) that the depictions of the eagle and jaguar within the sanctuary are symbols of the diurnal and nocturnal suns, respectively ; so too, it has been demonstrated that the circular nature of the sanctuary is cosmolo gically relevant to the birth and establishment of the fifth and present cosmo gonie epoch. If the symbolism of the sanctuary is viewed in relation to spa tial orientation, then the following symbolic construct is revealed. With the placement of an eagle knight on the third and fourth level of the princi pal staircase, we have a direct correlation with Tonatiuh the solar deity. From the establishment of the fact that the deity portrayed on the fourth level of</page><page sequence="17">78 SOCIETE DES AMERICA.NISTES the staircase is, in fact, the solar deity ; the symbolic archetype of the temple structure becomes evident. The " Eagle House " of Malinalco, examined in relation to an iconographie perspective, reveals that the transit of the solar deity, " Tonatiuh ", is sym bolized in relation to the concept regarding the reptilian toad-like " Earth Monster The Earth Monster, as previously alluded to, was reponsible or devouring and subsequently regurgitating the solar deity in its transitory state between day and night. Hence, it is my contention that the temple sym bolically conceptualizes the suns transit through the levels of the celestial vault, as indicated by the thirteen levels of the stairways composition, and elements of symbolism relative to world-plan considerations. The representation of the gaping jaws of the Earth monster at the summit of the staircase reveals the concept regarding cosmologies which explain the transit of the sun in terms of its consumption and regurgitation by the Earth monster. So too, the sym bols of the eagle and jaguar are relative to conceptions regarding the solar deity in its transitory state from the nocturnal jaguar to the celestial eagle, as well as its birth and emergence from caverns (Heyden, 1975 : 134). The entire temple, in effect, is an archetype which symbolizes the celestial transit of the sun and all the concepts relevant to the cosmic order. In conclusion, it is my contention that the use of ethnographic and ethno historic analogy in the analysis of the ritual context of temple symbolism is of major import to Americanist studies, for, as is stated by Munn (1973 : 608), " the interpretation of ritual must bring together examinations of social process and of the complex meanings in the cultural code, it gives us a parti cularly important vantage point for viewing these fundamental problems " .
