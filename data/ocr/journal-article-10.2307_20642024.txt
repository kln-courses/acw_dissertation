<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Their baggage a long line of sepa ration and dispersement": Haunting and Trans-generational Trauma in Joe Turner's Come and Gone Sinikka Grant Sinikka Grant holds a Ph.D. in English from the University of Buffalo. She is currently a Carnahan Post-doctoral Fellow at Washington &amp; Jefferson College, where she teaches courses in American literature. In his ten-play chronicle of African American experience in the twentieth cen tury August Wilson examines the impact of the past in the present.1 His plays abound with cultural traditions, music, art, and what James Baldwin referred to as "the field of manners and rituals of intercourse"?a phrase Wilson frequently cited?all of which are manifestations of deliberate, creative incorporation of the past in the present.2 The past is not always welcome in Wilson s plays, however, but is sometimes an uninvited guest whose arrival the characters experience as an intrusion. In these moments we can say that the past has returned to haunt the present. The Piano Lesson, for example, literally includes ghosts, and in other plays the past frequently intrudes as unpleasant memories or horrifying visions (Wilson 1990). In many</page><page sequence="2">Sinikka Grant 97 of his plays, however, we encounter haunting as trauma, a psychological wound in a character or characters in the play, such as Troy Maxson in Fences (1990), Herald Loomis in Joe Turner's Come and Gone (1988), and King in King Hedley II (2004). Moreover, these characters are haunted not just by their own personal pasts, but also by centuries of injustice suffered by their ances tors; they are victims of trans-generational trauma. In this article I will examine haunting as trans-generational trauma in August Wilson's Joe Turner's Come and Gone, a play in which the impact that violent events in the lives of past generations have on the following genera tions is central to the dramatic intensity of the play. In Joe Turner the trans generational trauma is largely a result of the gaps in African American cul tural memory that the unknown and untold stories of the Middle Passage and slavery entail. This trauma, which is inextricably linked with questions of mourning and melancholia, is manifest in the traumatized character of Herald Loomis, whose personal experiences of violence mirror those of his ancestors, as well as in the on-going struggle between Western influences and African heritage in the play. Most literary critics working on haunting associate it with psychological trauma. For example, in Cultural Haunting: Ghosts and Ethnicity in Recent American Literature, Kathleen Brogan links haunting with trauma, observing that both have to do with difficulties in remembering, in retrieving the past. Consequently, she argues, haunting is a means through which the writers can access a "forgotten" or unwritten cultural past. Although she and other crit ics refer both to Freud and to Cathy Caruth's work on trauma, I find that to better understand how and why traumatic events lead to haunting we need to examine more carefully the structure of trauma, both in terms of the sub ject and in relation to time. Trauma is the result of either undergoing or witnessing a horrific, vio lent event, or a series of events or circumstances the accumulated impact of which eventually results in trauma. The terror of violence is ultimately in that something that should not happen in the first place?the unthinkable, the unspeakable?nevertheless occurs. Such an event is incomprehensible. One cannot understand what exactly is happening or why, and the event as such therefore does not enter the consciousness of its survivor or witness. Outside consciousness and thus outside of active remembrance the "experience" of a traumatic event is therefore defined by a constitutive forgetting or amnesia. But although trauma is defined by forgetting, the victim or witness of trauma is paradoxically destined to re-live the shock many times in the future, as fragmented memories?what Freud called the "return of the repressed"?will return in nightmares and visions.3 This repressed material is precisely that which is beyond active remembering: these are memories that</page><page sequence="3">98 College Literature 36.2 [Spring 2009] cannot be voluntarily called to mind. As Cathy Caruth points out, "The his torical power of trauma is not just that the experience is repeated after its forgetting, but that it is only in and through its inherent forgetting that it is experienced at all" (1996,17). The return of the repressed is often called haunting; nevertheless, this is not exactly what we encounter in works of August Wilson. In Joe Turner and other Wilson plays the traumatic events haunting the text are frequently gen erations removed from the time in which the play is set. The return of the repressed, however, is directly linked with one and the same person, who has either witnessed or lived through horror, or both. Therefore, as the French psychoanalysts Karl Abraham and Maria Torok point out in The Shell and the Kernel, when a person haunted by events from the past has no experiential connection to those events, there is nothing he or she could have repressed. What returns from the past, they argue, is thus not the repressed, but the manifestation of a secret in the psyche of another person. Yet how the psychic matter of one person is actually transferred to the psyche of another indi vidual remains unclear even to them. It is evident, however, as Nicholas Rand notes in his editorial introduction to The Shell and the Kernel, that "the issue is the process of transmission which assures the survival of the memory traces derived from the experiences of earlier generations" (Abraham and Torok 1994, 168-69; my emphasis). Consequently, psychoanalysis alone may not fully explain the trans-gen erational transmission of traumatic material. Therefore, I suggest that to bet ter understand haunting as trans-generational trauma we need to comple ment psychoanalytic theory with the psychoanalytically informed philoso phy of Maurice Blanchot. Blanchot argues that trauma?or what he calls the disaster?cannot strictly speaking be experienced at all: devoid of conscious ness, there is no "I"?no subject?to experience anything. Beyond experi ence, knowledge, memory, and understanding, the disaster distorts the lin earity of time. Blanchot writes about passivity, a concept he directly associ ates with the impossibility of experiencing the disaster4: Passivity is measureless: for it exceeds being; it is being when being is worn past the nub?the passivity of a past which has never been, come back again. It is the disaster defined?hinted at?not as an event of the past, but as the immemorial past which returns, dispersing by its return the present, where, ghostly, it would be experienced as a return. (Blanchot 1995,17) Blanchot argues here that the loss of subjectivity at the heart of the dis aster?the lack of consciousness caused by the incomprehensibility of the sit uation?calls into question the notion of being and the relation of being to time. Consequently, the disaster is inextricably linked with the question of ontology?the question of being as such. If there is no "I" to experience the</page><page sequence="4">Sinikka Grant 99 event, there is no "being present" either. The disaster causes the relation of being and time to be dispersed, creating what Blanchot calls "time out of syn chrony." That unknown?or what Abraham and Torok call a secret?at the heart of the disaster does, however, like everything else in the world, leave an imprint. That imprint, that secret, is the "memory-trace" of an event that was never brought to consciousness and this trace is what comes back to haunt. Both psychoanalysis and (psychoanalytically informed) philosophy thus indicate that horror and violence disrupt the linear progression of time and cause the past to intrude in the present. This allows us to consider haunting in a broader sense than the traditional notion of haunting as having to do with ghosts or visions of past events, and define haunting rather as a structure where a trace of past violence intervenes in the present. And, according to this definition, the plays of August Wilson?each profoundly affected by his torical violence that has helped to create the world that the text repre sents?are all haunted.5 In Joe Turner's Come and Gone, this haunting mani fests itself not as ghosts, but as a psychological trauma transmitted from one generation to another, stretching back to the traumatic events of the Middle Passage and of slavery, that mark the inception of African American experi ence in America. Significantly, Joe Turner is set on the cusp of radical changes in African American history: in 1911 the Great Migration, the flow of hundreds of thousands of African Americans from the impoverished, rural, segregated South to the industrial, desegregated North in search of a better fife, had only just begun. The play examines the efforts of Herald Loomis, a man whose life has been destroyed by the injustices of racism, to move on in fife?to imag ine a future that would once and for all be his. Moreover, it examines how his family, friends, and other people who come into contact with him are affected by the past that haunts Loomis and his pursuit of a life worth living. Wilson opens Joe Turner with a highly poetic preface to the text6, which evokes the sentiment of the Great Migration not so much through specific historical detail, but through a description of the migrants' reasons for com ing North, what they bring with them, and what they hope to find in this new place.7 He begins by painting an image of the city of Pittsburgh in 1911, an industrial city whose prosperity comes largely from steel. In Wilson s description the city is anthropomorphized8: it is a living thing, with "the fires of the steel mill" pumping out its blood of cold, hard steel, which the river carries through the city?a city that "flexes its muscles," both in the sense of expanding and showing off its power. Into this city characterized by indus trialization, energy, and hard work arrive "the sons and daughters of newly freed African slaves."</page><page sequence="5">loo College Literature 36.2 [Spring 2009] These migrating African Americans are from the outset depicted as peo ple who suffer from amnesia: they are "isolated, cut off from memory," they have "forgotten the names of the gods" and are "only guessing at their faces." We are not only talking about traumatized individuals here, but also about a people who collectively carry the traces of a traumatic history. These "marked men and women" arrive with hope, however, that in this "new land" they can find a better life. They arrive with "a song worth singing," looking for a place that would recognize their contributions to society and affirm their place in it as equals. The preface also tells us a lot about the cultural makeup of these new comers. Wilson makes a point of describing them initially as "the sons and daughters of newly freed African slaves." But we learn more about them as we move on: "They arrive carrying Bibles and guitars." In other words, hav ing "forgotten" their gods, they appear to have taken on another God, one that belongs to the Western tradition and that the dominant white culture has introduced to them.9 The forgetting is not absolute, however, as we know that their ways of worshipping the Christian God retain characteristics of the way their African ancestors used to worship their own gods.10 Similarly, while they bring along the guitar, a musical instrument which is also of Western origin (though African cultures had their own string instruments, too, such as the dousson' goni and the kora harp), they have by 1911 devel oped a technique different from that of the classical European guitar and a music that carries traces of African musical traditions, characterized by minor notes, known as the "blue notes"?music we now know as the blues. Wilson thus establishes the identity of the migrating African Americans as what we could call "hyphenated," whereby the conjunction between the two parts?African and American?is not smooth and unproblematic.11 While the hyphen connects the two main sources of African American iden tity, it can also be seen as a metaphoric representation of a wound, consist ing here of the cut that the Middle Passage caused on African cultural her itage and a range of violent experiences that African slaves and their descen dants have endured in America. Wilson further emphasizes the traumatic nature of this conjunction: Foreigners in a strange land, they carry as part and parcel of their baggage a long Une of separation and dispersement which informs their sensibiUties and marks their conduct as they search for ways to reconnect, to reassem ble, to give clear and luminous meaning to the song which is both a wail and a whelp of joy. (Wilson 1988, "The Play," n.p.) The identity of the migrating African Americans is thus partly shaped by cuts in cultural memory caused by "a long line of separation" from family and friends, from the Middle Passage to the tearing apart of farniUes under the</page><page sequence="6">Sinikka Grant 101 arbitrary power of slave holders, to disappearances of family members, friends, and lovers through escape, lynching, or, in the 20th century, through migration in search of a different future, or sometimes just because they got the "walking blues."12 What characterizes these various forms of separation listed above is the impossibility of mourning. To cope with the loss of a loved one each culture has created its own rituals of mourning, consisting of a burial and usually some form of remembrance of the deceased. But the kinds of separation from the loved one described above make mourning infinitely more difficult: how does one mourn someone who has disappeared but who may or may not be dead? How does one mourn if there is no body, or if the body has been mutilated beyond recognition? In situations like these, those surviving are left with a sense of uncertainty, a longing impossible to articulate and therefore impossible to let go of. Such longing, holding survivors back in the past, leaves them in a state of melancholia, which makes it difficult for them to project their fives toward the future. In order to live on, however, they need to be able to conceive a future. In Joe Turner the migrating African Americans are looking for a new environment that would enable them to let go of the past and envision a better future for themselves and their children. Wilson's preface to Joe Turner, in its emphasis on the search for a better life, suggests the migration to the North almost as a pilgrimage to a Promised Land. But his vision of the redemptive possibilities of Christian faith is bleak, and similarly suspect is the promise of equality in the North. The faith and dreams of the characters in this play are put to the test against the forces of the past and the harsh reality of the present. The setting for the emotional turmoil of the characters is, quite appropriately, a boardinghouse run by an African American couple, Seth and Bertha. Bynum, the resident conjure man, is the only relatively permanent guest in the boardinghouse. All the other guests are more or less transient, resting for a while in their search for somebody or someplace that would help them realize their dreams. For the guests the boardinghouse is a home away from home, where Miss Bertha's fried chicken and the dance of Juba on Sundays bring the residents together and give them, at least momentarily, a sense of community. The play begins by demonstrating the multiplicity of African American culture and experience, and the efforts to straddle different cultural influ ences that the preface already suggested. We meet at the opening of the play the owners of the boardinghouse, Seth Holly and his wife Bertha. Stage directions tell us that Seth differs from all the other characters in the play in that "born of Northern free parents, a skilled craftsman, and owner of the boardinghouse, he has a stability that none of the other characters have" (1988, l).The difference between Seth and his wife is obvious from their</page><page sequence="7">102 College Literature 36.2 [Spring 2009] attitudes towards Bynum, whom Seth is watching perform his "conjuring." Seth ridicules Bynum, wondering out loud why he tolerates his "mumbo jumbo" (2). We learn from Bertha, however, that despite his apparent intol erance of Bynum s craft, Seth has nothing against his blessing the house. For Bertha, Bynum s rites are part of everyday life in the boardinghouse, and for her the African spiritual heritage coexists happily with Christianity. When Seth mocks her for "going down there to the church and wanna come home and sprinkle salt all over the place," Bertha calmly answers to him: "It don't hurt none. I can't say ifit help ... but it don't hurt none" (2). Seth and Bertha's attitudes demonstrate the (often contradictory) coex istence ofWestern norms, traditions, values, and spirituality with those deriv ing from African cultures. This applies to some extent to most of the charac ters in the play, with the possible exception of Bynum, whose sense of self seems firmly rooted in his African heritage. The struggle between Western and African heritage is a central concern of the play, and its climax ultimate ly affirms one over the other. The stage is set for this struggle already in the first scene of the play, where two concepts, in a variety of different contexts, are either explicitly or implicitly evoked over and over again: money and blood. Money, of course, sig nifies Western capitalism, the rise of which was the reason behind the African slave trade in the first place. Blood, on the other hand, takes on a multiplic ity of meanings here, from referring to the kinds of bloody events that mark African American history, to blood as kinship, or as a reference to African spirituality, where blood sacrifice?which Bynum keeps alive in his own practice?is part of many rituals. Money is certainly at the core of the conversation between Bertha and Seth about Seths difficulties in getting funding to start a welding shop of his own (Wilson 1988, 3). These difficulties are characteristic of the prejudice and discrimination that African Americans faced in the desegregated North: despite the fact that he has a plan and can demonstrate the skills, Seth can not get a loan to start up a business?at least not without using his house as security, and he does not trust the white man enough to do that. Later in the scene the words money, dollar, and cent are mentioned repeat edly, mostly in conjunction with Seths various business enterprises: his trans actions with Rutherford Selig?a white peddler for whom he makes pots, pans, and other metal items? and when he collects money from his board ers. The other time we hear talk about money is when Jeremy, a young southerner, who Bynum says still has "a lot of country in him," tells how he got arrested on his payday for no real reason and was freed after paying the white cops two dollars (Wilson 1988,5).These instances all demonstrate that</page><page sequence="8">Sinikka Grant 103 money drives the white, dominant society, and African Americans are having a hard time getting their share of the growing economy. We also witness an exchange of money when Bynum gives advice to Mattie Campbell, who seeks to find the man who walked out on her. The difference here is, however, that when Mattie asks Bynum how much she owes him for the advice, Bynum has no set price for the help he offers, but says instead: "Whatever you've got there ... that'll be alright" (Wilson 1988, 24). This implies that Bynum does not set a specific monetary value on his services, as his "customers" often have little or nothing to offer, but is rather rewarded by seeing people benefit from his advice and his skills. Finally, at the end of the scene we find the two children in this play, Zonia and Reuben, discussing the business that Reuben makes with the pigeons he took over after his friend Eugene's death. Like Eugene before him, he sells the pigeons to Bynum, who sacrifices them as part of his rites. Consequently, Zonia and Reuben, who represent the next generation and thus the future, are already unavoidably positioned between Western and African influences?between money and blood. Blood, both in the sense of lineage and as an integral element ofVoodoo, is crucial to Bynum's African-derived rituals, which the play evokes from the very beginning. The audience, however, learns about them only secondhand, through Seths observations of Bynum's acts offstage. To sacrifice a chicken on stage would certainly not be possible in any case, but this indirect access to selected aspects of the ritual is also particularly appropriate because such rituals are usually meant to be kept secret from the uninitiated. Seth, whose attitudes (due to his financially more secure situation, but maybe also because he was born of free parents and therefore does not have as ready access to memories about slavery as the others do) are more westernized than those of the other characters, mocks Bynum's hoodoo rituals. Later on in the first act he does not even show any interest in Bynum's story about his "Shiny Man." Ironically, Bynum is telling the story to Rutherford Selig, a white man who takes pride in the fact that members of his family have for generations been "People Finders": his great-grandfather was a slaver, bringing slaves over the Atlantic Ocean, and his father hunted runaway slaves. In other words, the family trade he is so proud of is drenched with the blood of the slaves, the ancestors of Bynum, Seth, Bertha and the other black characters in the play. Selig explains that since emancipation he began to find "Nigras for Nigras," but admits that it isn't as profitable as the "finding" his forefathers did. In introducing to us this part of Selig's heritage, the play emphasizes how Selig's family history is inextricably linked with that of Bynum and other African Americans, as his family has played an integral part in facilitating the conditions of oppression that mark African American history. Such intercon</page><page sequence="9">104 College Literature 36.2 [Spring 2009] nected histories between white and black Americans have also transmitted Western influence into African American culture and vice versa. Bynum s fam ily history, on the other hand, resonates with African cultures and African spiritual traditions. His story about the Shiny Man, though it may carry some biblical significance, too, is first and foremost a story about an encounter with ancestral spirits.13 Blood here signifies both lineage and a connection with African traditions. Bynum tells how he offers some food to a man he meets on the road, and the man asks Bynum to follow him. Bynum explains that he "was going back my way," which means back the way Bynum had come from, but maybe also "back" in the sense of going back to his past. He leads Bynum to a bend on the road, asks him to hold out his hands, and then rubs them together with his. When Bynum looks down to his hands, they are covered with blood. The stranger tells Bynum to rub the blood all over himself. Bynum explains: "that was a way of cleaning myself" (Wilson 1988, 9). The blood of Christ clears away sins in Christian belief, of course, but here we have cleansing by one s own blood, which is reminiscent of initia tion rites in many African traditions. In his work on African religions and philosophy, John Mbiti discusses the prevalence and significance of initiation rites in several African cultures. He points out that in some cultures there is a whole series of initiation rites, each preparing the initiates to a new level of maturity and hence of responsibility (1989,118-19). In many African reli gions, as well as in Haitian Voodoo, those who become "priests"14?houngan or mambo in Voodoo?have special rites that initiate them to the profession, and it is precisely such an initiation rite that Bynum s story presumably rep resents. Mbiti explains the meaning of bleeding in initiation rites as follows: The shedding of his blood into the ground binds him mystically to the liv ing-dead, who are symbolically living in the ground, or are reached at least through the pouring of libation on to the ground. It is the blood of new birth. The physical pain ... is the beginning of training them for difficul ties and suffering of later life. (Mbiti 1989,120) Blood is also a medium along which the Voodoo gods, or loas, can enter. The stranger may be either a houngan,who acts as a mediator between this world and the "other world" where the spirits and gods reside, or it may be an ancestral spirit.15 At any rate, the blood allows Bynum to enter a different world, where everything is bigger and where the stranger disappears into a shining light. He then encounters the spirit of his father, who carries him to the ocean?important as the body of water that separates America and Africa, but also where some loas reside, and the grave of those who did not survive the Middle Passage?and shows him "how to find his song" (Wilson 1988, 10). Bynum is now ready to practice his craft. He explains that he</page><page sequence="10">Sinikka Grant 105 chose a "binding song" because "that's what I've seen most when I was trav eling... people walking away and leaving one another"(10). Once again the play evokes the "long line of separation and dispersement" that haunts the descendants of African slaves. A moment after Selig has left, the mysterious character of Herald Loomis?a man who effectively embodies the separation and disperse ment?enters the stage. For someone as normative as Seth, who has a hard time accepting difference of any kind (we have already heard him tell that his house is a "decent" house, and that he "ain't gonna have folks talking"), the dark figure of Herald Loomis is ominous. Loomis strikes more perceptive and open-minded observers (such as Bertha or Bynum), as a man marked by some immense loss. In his character the effects of an incomprehensible, trau matic past are epitomized. To make things worse, his personal traumatic experiences resemble closely the larger "cultural" traumas of African American experience in the U.S. Indeed, Herald Loomis' personal trauma echoes the horrors of slavery and reaches as far back into the depths of cul tural memory?or rather, cultural amnesia?as the Middle Passage. When Herald Loomis enters the scene the stage directions describe him as follows: Herald Loomis is thirty-two years old. He is at times possessed. A man driv en not by the hellhounds that seemingly bay at his heels, but by his search for a world that speaks to something about himself. He is unable to har monize the forces that swirl around him, and seeks to recreate the world into one that contains his image. (Wilson 1988,13-14) This description suggests that the persona of Loomis is meant from the moment he enters the stage to reflect the profound loss of self that is the con sequence of the horrors that he has lived through, to make it tangible for the audience, despite the fact that it has not as yet got any knowledge of the vio lent events that have caused his trauma. In a way, the audience is thus made to feel the force of the trauma in a manner suggestive of the "experience" of the victim: the effects of the violent events are felt prior to any conception of the events themselves. Loomis' "looks" bother Seth. Having taken Loomis up to his room he says to others: "Something ain't setting right with that fellow" (Wilson 1988, 19). In Seths normative perspective there is little room for difference and appearances are very important (13). For Seth things are the way they seem to be, and he lacks the sensitivity and openness that allows Bertha and Bynum to be much better judges of character. Bertha and Bynum are aware that something is, indeed, wrong with Loomis, but they also discern that instead of Loomis being violent, he is a victim of violence and injustice. When Seth claims that Loomis is "one of them mean-looking niggers look like he done</page><page sequence="11">106 College Literature 36.2 [Spring 2009] killed somebody gambling over a quarter," Bynum immediately corrects him, and confirms that, as he said, Loomis has been wandering the roads. Bynum has observed Loomis carefully, and tells Seth: "He ain't no gambler. Gamblers wear nice shoes. This fellow got on clodhoppers. He been out there walking up and down them roads" (20). In other words, there is a dif ference between mere speculation and conclusions based on observation. The text quickly confirms that Loomis has indeed lost something: he is looking for his wife, Martha. Like Loomis' looks, this statement also evokes different reactions among the people gathered around the kitchen table. Bynum suggests immediately that he needs to talk to the "People Finder," while Seth tells Bertha that he knows who Loomis is looking for, as he could detect the familiar features of Martha Pentecost, who once stayed in the boardinghouse, in Loomis' daughter, Zonia. But since he is suspicious of Loomis because of his looks, he has no intention of telling him where his wife is. Bertha questions Seth s assumptions about who speaks the truth and why, however, by asking Seth how he could be so sure that Loomis was the one lying and Martha the one telling the truth. For Seth, Martha's devout Christianity testifies to her truthfulness, while Loomis odd behavior renders him unreliable (Wilson 1988, 34). This exchange about truth and lies also ties in with the question of mem ory: whose memory can be trusted and what determines it. Seth and Bertha have a hard time coming to an agreement about the temporal sequence of events regarding Martha's stay with them and whether Bynum was already liv ing in the house. Bertha asserts that Martha came to the house looking for Bynum, while Seth maintains that she arrived before Bynum moved in. The disagreement is finally resolved as Bertha reminds Seth of a particular incident: BERTHA: Well, if she came on before Bynum I don't know where she stayed. Cause she stayed up there in Hiram's room. Hiram couldn't get along with Bynum and left out of here owing you two dollars. Now, I know you ain't forgot about that! SETH: Sure did! You know Hiram ain't paid me that two dollars yet. So that's why he be ducking and hiding every time he see me down on Logan Street. You right. Martha did come on after Bynum. I forgot that's why Hiram left. (Wilson 1988, 35-36) Bertha and Seth s dialogue shows that our perception of the past is sub jective at best. As Charles Shepherdson reminds us, "Memory is not the record of events in 'real,' sequential time, but their symbolic organization" (1993). In other words, no matter how we conceive of the past, it is always a narrative we have constructed from fragments of memory. Instead of relying on the story of the past as they remember it, Bertha and Seth therefore have to focus on concrete, verifiable facts to reconstitute the chronological</page><page sequence="12">Sinikka Grant 107 sequence of events and thereby determine what happened when. Having finally come to an agreement about the facts of the past they can conclude that Martha came to the boardinghouse for the specific purpose of asking help from Bynum. Memory and the construction of the past are also integral to our under standing of traumatic events, or disasters, as the initial forgetting at the core of a trauma prevents a construction of a complete narrative and produces the disjointed time of the disaster, or in Blanchot s words, "time out of syn chrony." The play includes several passages that directly engage the disaster and its curious temporality. Herald Loomis' vision of "the bones people" pro vides the clearest link to the Middle Passage as such a disaster in the play. Loomis, an ex-deacon who has lost his faith as a consequence of his painful experiences, gets upset when he enters the boardinghouse in the middle of the others dancing Juba and calling out the Holy Ghost. Totally beside himself he finally falls on the ground. In a manner of testifying, and assisted by Bynum's responses, he narrates his vision: LOOMIS: I done seen bones rise up out the water. Rise up and walk across the water. Bones walking on top of the water. BYNUM: Tell me about them bones, Herald Loomis. Tell me what you seen. LOOMIS: I come to this place ... to this water that was bigger than the whole world. And I looked out ... and I seen these bones rise up out the water. Rise up and begin to walk on top of it. BYNUM: Wasn't nothing but bones and they walking on top of the water. LOOMIS: Walking without sinking down. Walking on top of the water. BYNUM: Just marching in a line. (Wilson 1988, 53) They continue in this manner, and Loomis tells how the bones suddenly sank down and after having been washed on the land, changed from mere bones to bodies with flesh on them: "They black. Just like you and me. Ain't no dif ference" (Wilson 1988,54). All the bodies lie on the shore and gradually start breathing again, then stand up and walk away. Loomis continues: "The ground's starting to shake. There's a great shaking. The world's busting half in two. The sky's splitting open. I got to stand up" (55). Loomis's vision illustrates multiple aspects of the Middle Passage: the bones of those who died during the trip and were buried in the sea, or who chose to jump overboard rather than endure the horrors on the ship and to anticipate the new horrors awaiting at the end of the journey; the dispersion of the blacks, both upon arrival to the Americas and later during slavery, when family members where frequently sold away from each other. Significantly, the actual scattering of the bodies is preceded by a description</page><page sequence="13">108 College Literature 36.2 [Spring 2009] of a disaster, which echoes Nathan Huggins' account of the Middle Passage and its effect on those who survived it: [A] s in an earthquake, which begins with tremors, building to a catastrophe, each stroke deeper and broader than the last, one is finally left alone among other moving creatures, stunned, wounded, and isolated amid the shambles of the known world. In such a disaster, it is impossible for the survivor to fix the pain of the most telling blow and to completely rediscover himself after its enormity has passed. So, too, the African was engulfed in a process, the end of which was impossible to see from its onset and its precise begin nings lost forever to recall. (Huggins 1990, 27) In Loomis' account of his vision the world "busting half in two" similar ly calls to mind an earthquake?or metaphorically a splitting of the psyche. Huggins refers here to "the shambles of the known world," pointing to the fact that the Middle Passage cut the captured Africans' ties to everything familiar?language, history, culture, and family?throwing them into an abyss where everything is unrecognizable. They were thus stripped of the anchors of subjectivity and turned literally into objects. They were cut off from the past, unable to comprehend the present and unable even to guess the future. This is disaster defined?what Blanchot describes as that "which does not come, that which has put a stop to every arrival" (1995, 1) ?and such is its impact on the psyche that, as Huggins reminds us, the survivor will never fully recover from it. Indeed, its impact is felt generations later. Nevertheless, the cultural trauma of the Middle Passage has not by itself caused Loomis s present condition. His suffering is further intensified because the chain of events that has led to his personal trauma repeats uncannily the disaster of the Middle Passage: he was captured, taken away from his home and family and was consequently subjected to forced labor. While Loomis has not himself experienced the horrors of the Middle Passage, he carries with in himself traces of his ancestors' unspeakable experiences, passed on unwit tingly from one generation to another. Nicolas Abraham explains that, "The concept of the phantom [or the ghost] ... suggest[s] the existence within an individual of a collective psychology comprised of several generations, so that the analyst must listen for the voices of one generation in the unconscious of another" (1994,166). Bynum, whose profession as a houngan is akin to that of a psychoanalyst (Deren 1975, 161-63), therefore has to listen in Loomis' account of his vision to the voice of the ghosts from generations back. Later, when Loomis tells Bynum the story of how he was snatched from the road by Joe Turner and forced to work in a chain gang for him for seven years, we learn that he is particularly tormented by the question that he asks Bynum at the end of his tale: "Why he got to catch me going down the road by my lonesome?" (Wilson 1988,73).This question supports both Caruth's and</page><page sequence="14">Sinikka Grant 109 Blanchot s arguments about trauma and disaster respectively, as it is precisely the fact that he cannot understand why this disaster was inflicted upon him that is at the core of Loomis' suffering. This is the question he can ask, instead of that other question which, Blanchot tells us, the disaster does not allow us to entertain: "What have you done to gain knowledge of the disaster?" (3). We learn further from Loomis' story that during the years of his captiv ity under Joe Turner his dreams and hopes were centered on being able to rejoin his family. More precisely, he drew strength from the image of his wife, Martha, who at the time of Loomis' capture was a young woman of only six teen or seventeen, and the mother of their baby girl. When he returns after seven years to what he has envisioned as his home, he finds out that his wife has gone North and left their daughter, Zonia, with her mother. Consequently, Loomis takes the child and embarks on a search for his wife. This seems a rather irrational thing to do. Traveling with a child, who at the beginning of their journey was only seven years old, would have been very difficult. Why not try to find work and let the grandmother look after the child while he was working? Why this obsession with finding his wife? The text offers at least two possible explanations. We know from early on in the play that Martha has visited Bynum shortly after she returned South to pick up her daughter and found out that her husband had taken Zonia with him. As Bynum later explains, he "bound up" the mother and child with his "binding song," thus in effect leading Loomis' steps towards Martha. Ironically, he was also the person who told Selig, "The People Finder," where to find her. The text thus suggests that Bynum sent Loomis on the road to search for his wife in order to bring together the mother and child. But Loomis had already begun his search by the time Martha contacted Bynum. Martha tells Loomis that she came to her mother's place to fetch Zonia two months after Loomis had been there. In other words, while Bynum's conjuring may have guided Loomis' steps slowly towards Martha, he was not the reason why Loomis began the search in the first place. In his own words Loomis states that he needed to "see [Martha's] face so I can get me a starting place in the world.... I been wandering a long time in some body else's world. When I find my wife that be the making of my own" (Wilson 1988, 72). What drives Loomis, then, is the desire to see his wife's "face."The image of his wife has become extremely important to Loomis over his years of cap tivity. Indeed, this image is so invested with his dreams and desires that when he finds that she is gone he is once again left in an emotional limbo. As if los ing his freedom for seven years was not enough, now he has also lost what was the center of his survival in the first place. His libidinal investment in what he remembers as his wife makes it impossible for him to accept that he</page><page sequence="15">no College Literature 36.2 [Spring 2009] has lost her, to do the work of mourning, and to move on with his life. I maintain that it is precisely this inability to mourn that drives Herald Loomis to search for his wife. In her analysis of what she calls the illness of mourning Maria Torok sug gests that if the desires concerning the lost love object have not been intro jected (assimilated into the psychic process of the patient's self-creation) at the time of the loss or departure of the love object, mourning cannot be completed. Therefore, the illness is, in fact, the inability to do the work of mourning. She explains: Because the unassimilated portion of the drives has congealed into an imago, forever reprojected onto some external object, the incomplete and dependent ego finds itself caught in a self-contradictory obligation. The ego needs to keep alive at all costs that which causes its greatest suffering. Why this obligation? It is understandable if we consider the following. The imago, along with its external embodiment in the object, was set up as the repository of hope; the desires it forbade would be realized one day. Meanwhile, the imago retains the valuable thing whose lack cripples the ego. (Abraham and Torok 1994,116) While the loss of freedom and the forced labor are traumatic enough to cause severe psychological problems?even more so, as these violent incidents are directly reminiscent of the horrors endured by Loomis' ancestors, only a gen eration earlier?we see from Loomis' description to Bynum that he consid ers the separation from his family (equally invested with memories of sepa ration through generations of African Americans) the most terrifying blow of all. He says about Joe Turner: "He catch you and go home to his wife and family Ain't thought about you going home to yours" (Wilson 1988,72). For seven years he kept alive the hope of being reunited with his family; there fore, we can understand that finding her gone would only throw Loomis deeper into despair. The strength of his libidinal investment prohibited the work of mourning necessary for him to be able to look into the future and move on with his Ufe. When Loomis and Zonia finaUy find Martha, however, it is too late for them to become a family again. Too many years have passed, and too much experience separates Loomis from his wife. Nevertheless, the final scene promises a future for Loomis, and the way to that future goes, paradoxicaUy, through the past: embracing his African heritage finaUy aUows Herald Loomis to envision a future. Loomis hears at the end of the play that Martha had asked Bynum to help her find her daughter and assumes that Bynum has bound him "to the road." Furious, he declares: "Joe Turner's come and gone and Herald Loomis ain't for binding. I ain't gonna let nobody bind me up!" (Wilson 1988, 91).</page><page sequence="16">Sinikka Grant ill He rejects angrily Martha's efforts to impose Christianity as the answer to his troubles. He tells her: "I don't need nobody to bleed for me! I can bleed for myself" (93). Loomis slashes his chest, and like Bynum earlier in his story of the Shiny Man, in a manner reminiscent of an initiation rite, rubs the blood over his face. The stage directions read as follows: Having found his song, the song of self-sufficiency, fully resurrected, cleansed and given breath, free from any encumbrance other than the workings of his own heart and the bonds of his flesh, having accepted the responsibility for his own presence in the world, he is free to soar above the environs that weighed and pushed his spirit into terrifying contractions. (Wilson 1988,94) Loomis declares that he is now finally able to "stand" on his own. The audience is to believe that he is no longer bound to the ghosts from the past, that Joe Turner is indeed now "come and gone," and Loomis can now focus on the future. Hence, for Bynum, he is now "shining like new money" (Wilson 1988,94). Loomis'"rebirth" simultaneously confirms Bynum's pow ers, since Bynum recalls his father's spirit telling him: "if I ever saw [a shiny man] again before I died then I would know that my song had been accept ed and worked its power in the world" (10). This bloody rite thus affirms the power of African heritage. The "shine" that Bynum sees emanating from Loomis suggests further that he experi ences some kind of "enlightenment," a self-recognition or self-knowledge that would transcend the traumatic unknowing. But since the unknowing and forgetting are constitutive of a trauma, its secret can never be known as such. In other words, there is no "cure" for trauma?it is a wound that never completely heals. However, if the victim of trauma finds a way to exterior ize some of the pain, partial healing is possible.16 Because of its relation to time, trauma is directly linked with narrative (in the sense of organizing events in time). Blanchot, for example, describes the disaster as the un-story?that which escapes narration.17 Consequently, while the heart of the disaster will always remain unknown, a narrative, although always incomplete, nevertheless allows the survivor to begin to create for himself a sense of temporality. Therefore, in telling the story of his captivity to Bynum, Loomis has already taken a step towards what we may call a par tial healing: the narrative enables him to entertain the thought of a future. The initiation rite may similarly function as a means of exteriorizing the pain. First of all, the cutting of the flesh becomes a bodily inscription of his pain. Moreover, Mbiti explains that the physical pain that the initiation caus es is meant as "the beginning of training ... for difficulties and sufferings of later life" (1989, 120). Consequently, the purpose of the rite is specifically directed towards the future: it teaches how to cope, how to live with pain in</page><page sequence="17">112 College Literature 36.2 [Spring 2009] the future. Loomis' narrative of his vision and the blood ritual at the end of the play can thus both function as steps towards healing his psychic wounds. Complete healing, a "knowing" that many critics see in the ending of the play, is impossible, however. There is no cure for trauma, only strategies for living with it. Since the last words of the play?Bynum's "Herald Loomis, you shining! You shining like new money!"?emphasize Loomis s transformation, we may assume upon reading the play that Wilson wishes to leave us with a clear pos itive note. A performance of the play, however, can prove otherwise. The multi-dimensionality of theatre, with its capacity to make us as spectators witness the suffering that the characters are experiencing on stage, has a more direct and tangible impact on us than simply reading a text would have, and in the case of Joe Turner reveals the full complexity of the play's ending. Throughout their search for Martha, Loomis has been unable to even imagine a future for his daughter, Zonia. Consequently, he is constantly scared of her "getting grown on him." In the final scene, upon finding Martha, Loomis "hands [Zonia] over" to her mother. In doing so he creates a new trauma for his daughter, who cries in panic: "I won't get bigger! My bones won't get no bigger! They won't! I promise! Take me with you till we keep searching and never finding. I won't get no bigger! I promise!" (Wilson 1988,91). Now Zonia's world is split in two. She is separated from her father and has to move to stay with her mother. The shock will undoubtedly be all the more significant because her father, who has continuously expressed his fear of her growing up, leaves her just when she is on the verge of woman hood. Instead of being able to carry out peacefully the project of adoles cence?a gradual pulling away from the parents?she is instead abruptly abandoned by a parent. In Zonia's mind her womanhood will thus forever be linked with being abandoned by the first man she ever loved?her father. Loomis's "handing" or "passing" over of his daughter thus functions as yet another repetition of the trauma of violent separation, and passes it on to the following generation. Although this may not exactly correspond to what Abraham and Torok would consider as creating a trans-generational phantom, the play nevertheless shows that one way to transmit a trauma to the follow ing generations is to create for the children a new trauma whose structure and content resemble one's own, and in this case also the larger cultural traumas. Creating this new trauma thus perpetuates the cycle of repetitive traumas. The portrayal of trans-generational trauma in its full complexity is pre cisely what makes Joe Turner an extraordinarily powerful play. It demonstrates convincingly the repetition, the disjointed temporality and the impossibility of understanding inherent in trauma, and illuminates the strength of melan cholia, or the "illness of mourning." It also suggests that some degree of heal</page><page sequence="18">Sinikka Grant 113 ing is possible, and that for Wilson this healing may be achieved by embrac ing African spiritual traditions. And yet, the end of the play also reminds us that breaking the cycle of trans-generational trauma is very difficult. As the audience celebrates Herald Loomis' triumphant departure, remaining on stage is his daughter Zonia, her body and face betraying the pain for which she has no words. She may be holding the hand of her newly-found moth er, but this reunion cannot eliminate the traumatic impact of having been abandoned by her beloved father. Therefore, as the lights go down to black18 our joy for Loomis mixes with the sadness we feel for Zonia. As we leave the theatre, the image of the jubilant Herald Loomis is thus overshadowed by the haunting image of Zonia, a little girl who has become yet another victim of trans-generational trauma, doomed to take on the burden of "separation and dispersement." Notes 1 Harry J. Elam,Jr. makes this evident in his influential book, The Past as Present in the Drama of August Wilson (2006). 2 See for example Wilson's speech at the National Black Theater Festival on August 4,1997, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina (1998). 3 One of the best literary examples of such loss of subjectivity is Toni Morrison's description of how Shadrack is traumatized in the war in Sula. In the midst of the horror he "could not muster up the proper feeling" and instead could only feel "the bite of a nail in his boot." There is a deep disconnect between Shadrack's emotions and the violence surrounding him; the world is going crazy and, unable to take it in, all he can feel is the physical pain in his foot?a feeling he on some level knows is completely inadequate for the magnitude of the horror that he witnesses. In the midst of the escalating madness he cannot "register the shock" (2004, 7-8). 4 Passivity is Blanchot's term for an experience (if indeed it can be called an experience, because it is characterized by an erasure of the subject) that distorts the linearity of time, an experience that is beyond knowledge, memory and understand ing. It is a concept that resists definition, and in writing about passivity we therefore find Blanchot bringing to fight different aspects of passivity and showing how passiv ity relates to other relevant concepts, such as patience, suffering, responsibility, writ ing, and death. Passivity (the "experience" of disaster) leads to haunting (1995). 5 According to this structural notion of haunting the works of, for example, Suzan-Lori Parks, Amiri Baraka, and Adrienne Kennedy are equally haunted. A broader discussion of haunting in African American drama is, however, beyond the scope of this essay. 6 The same applies to the first two plays of the cycle as well, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom and Fences (1985 and 1986 respectively). 7 The preface in its entirety reads as follows: It is August in Pittsburgh, 1911. The sun falls out of heaven like a stone. The fires of the steel mill rage with a combined sense of industry and progress. Barges loaded</page><page sequence="19">114 College Litereture 36.2 [Spring 2009] with coal and iron ore trudge up the river to the mill towns that dot the Monongahela and return with fresh, hard, gleaming steel.The city flexes its muscles. Men throw countless bridges across the rivers, lay roads and carve tunnels through the hills sprouting with houses. From the deep and the near South the sons and daughters of newly freed African slaves wander into the city. Isolated, cut off from memory, having forgotten the names of the gods and only guessing at their faces, they arrive dazed and stunned, their heart kicking in their chest with a song worth singing. They arrive carrying Bibles and guitars, their pockets lined with dust and fresh hope, marked men and women seeking to scrape from the narrow, crooked cobbles and the fiery blasts of the coke furnace a way of bludgeoning and shaping the malleable parts of them selves into a new identity as free men of definite and sincere worth. Foreigners in a strange land, they carry as part and parcel of their baggage a long line of separation and dispersement which informs their sensibilities and marks their con duct as they search for ways to reconnect, to reassemble, to give clear and luminous meaning to the song which is both a wail and a whelp of joy. (Wilson 1988,1) 8 Anthropomorphism, or personification, as a stylistic device is ingrained in the African American oral tradition. In blues lyrics, for example, houses, trains, or buses can come alive. 9 Wilson's plays also demonstrate the survival of African spiritual heritage along side Christianity. Such characters as Bynum and Aunt Ester are obvious representa tives of this tradition. But even a character like Wining Boy in The Piano Lesson tes tifies to the persistence of African spiritual traditions. After all, his story about "call ing the names of the ghosts of the Yellow Dog" is clearly a description of a ritual, where he calls for ancestral spirits at the crossroads of the railway tracks (Wilson 1990,34-35). 10 See Genovese (1974,161-93), for an excellent historical account of the con version of African Americans to Christianity, of African influences on black religion, and of how African American sensibilities shaped Christianity in the black commu nities in particular, and, to an extent, American notions of Christianity in general. 11 Like most terms denoting ethnic American identities, African American was at first spelled with a hyphen, "African-American" (and before that as "Afro American"). Although the recommended spelling is now without a hyphen, the hyphenated form is still relatively common, especially as an adjective. 12 In Fences Bono talks about how his father had the "walking blues" and one day just walked out of the door. 13 Both Sandra Shannon and Kim Pereira note the conflict between Christianity and African-derived spirituality in the play. For Shannon, Bynum's tale is "reminiscent of the African folktale," and the Shiny Man "the African alternative to what August Wilson calls 'the white mans God'" (1989, 136-37). Pereira, on the other hand, reads Bynum's encounter with the Shiny Man primarily through the lens of Christianity, suggesting a meeting with St. John the Baptist (1995, 71-72). 14 I use the word priest in quotation marks here because it is a Western concept and does not, in effect, correspond to the responsibilities of a spiritual leader in</page><page sequence="20">Sinikka Grant H5 Voodoo or many African religions. For a more detailed discussion of the role o?houn gan and mambo in Haitian communities see Deren (1975, 25-26). 15 John Mbiti uses the Swahili terms sasa and zamani in his discussion of the concept of time in African cultures. Sasa is the temporal dimension consisting of the "time of the living," of experiential time, and zamani the dimension of the distant past (of the dead and of myth). Sasa does not, however, entail concepts of the future and the past as our linear time does. Mbiti explains: "in African thought, the Sasa 'swallows' up what in western or linear concept of time would be considered as the future. Events ... in the Sasa dimension must be either about to occur, or in the process of realization, or recently experienced." Moreover, Sasa and Zamani are not clearly distinguished, but overlap: "Sasa is really an experiential extension of th? Now moment.... stretched into the short future and into the unhmited past (or Zamani)." In this thought, death is not a sudden event either, but the dead remain in Sasa time as long as at least one person, who knew the deceased by name and who remembers him or her, is alive. Mbiti calls such a deceased a "living-dead": "a person who is physically dead but alive in the memory of those who knew him in his life as well as being alive in the world of spirits. Only after the memory of the living-dead has faded and there is nobody left who would remember them by name, will the process of dying be complete."The "living-dead" then "sink" into the Zamani time, and thus into what Mbiti calls the "collective immortality." For a more detailed discussion of African temporality (Mbiti 1989,15-28). 16 Many critics see the ending of the play precisely as a moment of a psycho logical or spiritual "healing." Harry J. Elam, Jr., for example, writes that "Through this ritual fragmentation [Loomis] is made whole, his personal crisis ritualistically redressed" (2006, 212), and Sandra Shannon declares that the play "offers a redemp tive subtext" (1989,142). 17 Blanchot writes about the disaster as "the un-story, that which escapes quo tation and which memory does not recall?forgetfulness as thought. That which, in other words, cannot be forgotten because it has always already fallen outside mem ory" (1995,28). 18 Each production decides on what to emphasize, of course, but Wilson's stage directions certainly suggest that the ending should not be simply positive. The stage directions explicitly state: "The lights go down to BLACK." Wilson always calls for lights going down to black or a "blackout," but the capitalization of "black" here indicates not a gradual dimming of light, but a sudden, violent switch from light to complete darkness?like the darkness that has just fallen on Zonia.
