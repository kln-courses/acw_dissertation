<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews periods-even in epitomes of Japanese "Buddhist" culture-marks Kanda's effort as both serious and timely. There are, nevertheless, some inconsistencies and flaws in her analysis of the religious dimensions of early Japanese iconography that might disturb the specialist. For example, it is unclear how anthropomorphic representations that do not fit neatly into her formal classification of "courtly" or "syncretic" types differ religiously from those which do. Haniwa (p. 7) and hitogata (p. 10), as well as the comparative examples described in chapters 5-7 ("Other Shinzo"), are apparently distinguished from shinzo primarily in terms of their cultic functions; those that stand as the kami's material embodiment to which offerings are made are categorized as shinzo. Yet in cases where they are not the central icon, as, for instance, with the zuishin of the late Heian period, this functional distinction is ignored, and instead formal properties are invoked. Even more puzzling are Kanda's characterizations of the nature of these statues: are they permanently imbued with divine power? If so, why must that power be renewed periodically in some cases and not in others? And in what ways then are these statues to be considered "symbols" (pp. 15, 26), particu- larly when they remain for the most part resolutely undisplayed? These are all questions that are arguably peripheral to Kanda's stated intent. Yet they address the very issues that give her study a much wider significance in terms of the relation between religion and art than the modesty of her title suggests. She has demonstrated that sacred art can be a unique and valuable source of insight, complementing literary evidence rather than con- firming or displacing it. What the questions suggest is that, in order to explore fully the possibilities Kanda has revealed, greater collaboration between scholars of art and religion is necessary. If Kanda's Shinzo is able to inspire such cooperative efforts, we all have much for which to be grateful to her. EDMUND T. GILDAY, Chicago, Illinois. COMAROFF, JEAN. Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance: The Culture and History of a South African People. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1985. 296 pp. $32.00 (cloth); $14.95 (paper). This is a study of the social, political, and religious life of the Tshidi of South Africa. The Tshidi are a branch of the southern Tswana who live in the rural area of the South African-Botswana borderland. Like perhiperal societies elsewhere in the underdeveloped world, the Tshidi are caught in a number of contradictions. They are peasants but also proletarian laborers; they are polit- ically powerless but also culturally powerful; they are politically oppressed but also religiously free; they are socially fragmented but also religiously whole; they are determined by outside forces but also inwardly self-determining. Comaroff's study of these contradictions is a morally sensitive and theo- retically articulate account of an oppressed society in a neocolonial world. More than half of the book is devoted to Tshidi religion, especially Tshidi Zionism, a Christian, charismatic healing movement that is widespread in black South Africa. Comaroff's approach is to see the Zionist churches as indices of wider political and economic oppression. She rejects as "idealist" any perspective that would regard the Zionist churches as religious associations because "it extends to them a literalist, ethnocentric theory of meaning which ignores their embeddedness in the total social and cultural system" (p. 169). 137</page><page sequence="2">TheJournal of Religion Thus she interprets Zionist ritual and symbolism as codified expressions of political resistance. Unfortunately, by looking at Tshidi religion primarily from the point of view of the "total" social and cultural system (whatever that is), Comaroff misses the rich theological texture of Tshidi religious life. She gives little atten- tion to Tshidi theological ideas and ritual practice, which she describes as "coded vehicles" of political and economic realities. Comaroff ignores the powerful experiential dimension of Zionist healing rituals, so well described in Bengt Sundkler's works (Bantu Prophets [Oxford, 1961], Zulu Zion [Oxford, 1971]). While Sundkler, too, points out the respects in which Zionism is a response to political oppression, he also treats it as a fundamentally religious phenomenon. To be sure, Comaroff does not dismiss Tshidi Zionism as a form of utopian delusion or as a primitive political movement. She regards it as an adaptive mechanism, a form of cultural resistance, that uses transformative healing rituals "to reform the body and the location of the person in the world" (p. 167). However, by reducing Zionism's multivocal symbolism to the political level, it is no wonder that Comaroff believes that the Tshidi "remain largely unselfconscious in any literal sense of the counterhegemonies they construct" (p. 261). This she confidently attributes to Tshidi realpolitik. The basic issue, it turns out, is not the question of how properly to interpret Tshidi religion but, rather, how to define the "constructs basic to the social sci- ences-power, motivation, resistance, reproduction, and transformation" (p. 260). Any perspective that does not interpret religion in these terms is therefore literalist and merely ethnocentric. But, then, in Comaroff's terms social science is equally ethnocentric once we recognize the embeddedness of its constructs in the totality of Western society and culture. If so, then there is obviously room for other perspectives as well. BENJAMIN C. RAY, University of Virginia. NEEDHAM, RODNEY. Exemplars. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of Cali- fornia Press, 1985. xvii + 247 pp. $19.95 (cloth). After reading Exemplars, a phrase came to mind that I had heard or read: "this book fills a much needed gap." Two of the nine essays were written for festschrifts that were never published, and the remaining essays were deliv- ered at various colleges and universities. The conspectus tries to bring the essays together within the framework of "comparativism" and individual "exemplars," and "as for the theoretical connections that can be made among them, on one or another ground of similarity, these also can be left to propose themselves" (p. 1). Given the disparate nature of the "exemplars," this simply will not do. Such introductions to a book of essays signifies trouble. The first essay is a brief reflection on a fragment of verse by Archilochus that is trans- formed into "fire:water::right:left" (p. 18) for comparative purposes. The second essay briefly addresses the question, given contrasting forms of life, "How do we describe what shall be our response to them?" (p. 27). This is seen as a moral problem and raises another question: does anthropology matter in our response? Sextus Empiricus is used as an example of a classical, compara- tivist, ethnographer's response. The essay ends with a Wittgensteinian solution. The third essay is a contemporary comparativist reflection on the 138</page></plain_text>
