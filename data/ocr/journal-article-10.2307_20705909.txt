<plain_text><page sequence="1">SHORTER COMMUNICATIONS CANOE STERN CARVINGS FROM THE SOLOMON ISLANDS Deborah Waite University of Hawaii Wooden carvings labelled "canoe ornament" from the Western and Central Districts of the Solomon Islands appear in many museum collections. Some, such as the canoe prow figureheads known as nguzunguzu, were described by writers who saw the carvings in the Solomons and have frequently been photographed lashed in position against the bows of canoes. Others, however, are less well documented and have not been photographed in situ. Occasional examples are not even alluded to as canoe ornaments but have been called "architectural orna ment" or "grave ornament" (e.g., Edge-Partington and Heape 1890, caption to PI. 210, No. 2, and British Museum 1944 Oc. 2 1702). This article attempts to address several questions about one type of carving, the most important being its identity as a canoe carving. If this can be established, the placement of the carvings on or within the canoe is a problem to be con sidered, as is the significance of the imagery and the island provenance of this carving type within the Solomons group. Available fragments of information about these and other canoe carvings from the Solomons, as well as analysis of stylistic and iconographie features, will provide some answers. Eighteen carvings of this type may be shown to be related by certain formal features (Figs 1, 3-5).1 Each consists of a flat triangular lower section surmounted by a three-dimensional anthropomorphic figure placed within a rectangular frame. The figure grasps the sides of the frame in each example. Total lengths of the carvings range from 47 to 77 centimetres. Three additional carvings are distinguished by the absence of the rectangular frame, but possess frame-like elements (Fig. 2).2 A flat horizontal bar, wider than the triangular lower portion, appears just above the head of each figure, and is joined, not to a frame, but to the upraised arms. Arms extend out at right angles to the torso with upper arms raised above the head, hands touching or merging with the upper bar so that the arms enframe the head within an approximately rectangular space. The chronology for the pieces is difficult to sort out, as is so often the case with museum specimens. Accession numbers indicate that several of the carvings were acquired by museums in the 19th century. The earliest recorded museum accession date is 1871 for an example in the St?dtisches Museum in Braunschweig (Andr?e 1891:7, Fig. 1).

Muller 1868:TF1I, Moschner 1967:6). One carving, now in the Auckland Museum (15048, Fig. 3), was illustrated by Edge-Partington in 1890 (PL 210, No. 2).3 Another was collected in the Solomons by C. M. Wood ford in the 1880s or 1890s (B. M. 1927-83). Carving 18220 in the University Museum, Philadelphia, was collected before 1891,4 and two carvings in the Pitt Rivers Museum (P. R. 3400 and Tufnell Collection 1899) also have a 19th century date of acquisition (Fig. 4). Twentieth century acquisition dates for the remaining carvings may or may not reflect the date of production or collection in the islands. The identification of the carvings as canoe ornaments becomes a process of deduction from limited documentation. Several are identified in museum records as canoe ornaments. The Braunschweig piece is described as a "canoe god" (Andr?e 1891:6). The example illustrated by Edge-Partington, who was District Magistrate at Gizo, Western District, Solomon Islands, from 1904 to 1909, was described by him as an "ornament fixed in the stern of a canoe when at sea. On returning to land it is removed and hung up in the house" (Edge-Partington 1890:P1.210, nr 2 caption). The Auckland Museum registration entry for the same carving describes it somewhat differently: Figure of a man standing in a framework. Placed on the forepost of a canoe when putting to sea to secure a good passage (Banbaru). The label for carving 3400 in the Pitt Rivers Museum refers to it as a "carved canoe god for fixing in the stern of a canoe as a charm for safety at sea". One carving, before its acquisition by the British Museum (Fig. 1), had been described as a "grave ornament of wood carved in the form of a human figure" (Beasley Collection 4308). Sources for these brief written records are never given, but Edge-Partington cited under "Additional Notes", in the volume which illustrated the Auckland canoe ornament, a reference which associated that carving with the journal of the French explorer Jean F. M. de Surville, who visited the Solomon Islands in 1769. Surville recorded that at Port Praselin, Santa Ysabel Island (southern coast, Bugotu district), he had seen a canoe which had a carving fastened to the stern: ". . .on the stern of the same canoe was a grotesque and horrid figure which was supposed to be an idol" (Fleurieu 1791:141). The remark is hardly enlightening and, even if true, says little about the type of carving and where it was fastened ? inside the canoe or out. The only other known apparent reference to carvings of this category is C. M. Woodford's mention of a sula daudau 'the figureboard in stern', which was evidently lashed to the inside of the raised stern of the binabina (or biabina), a large ornamented canoe from Santa Ysabel, said by Woodford (first Resident Commissioner of the Solomon Islands) to prevail also on the islands of Guadalcanal, Florida, and Savo in the Central District (Woodford 1909: 514-5, Pl. XLV).5 The tomako war canoe from the nearby New Georgia Islands (Western District) did not, according to Woodford, have a separate carving lashed</page><page sequence="8">54 DEBORAH WA ITE to the upraised stern. If this is correct, the type of carving illustrated by Edge Partington may indeed correspond to the one from Santa Ysabel mentioned by Sur ville (as Edge-Partington evidently intimated by citing the Surville reference). It would, then, be one of the two earliest-documented types of canoe carvings from this part of the Solomon Islands.6 Examination of these carvings engenders only further speculation about their position on or in a canoe, particularly when they are compared with other canoe carvings from the same region. The carvings share two features with another type of carving for which there is visual as well as verbal documentation with regard to placement on the canoe, namely, the presence of a flat triangular portion as well as holes bored along the top. This type consists of a flat triangular or U-shaped board ornamented with three-dimensional carved heads of birds or anthropo morphs (Fig. 6). Referred to as "hanging boards", these carvings were lashed to the prow or stern of a canoe so that they hung just above the waterline (Edge-Partington 1890:pl. 203, No. 5 and Codrington 1891:296, illustration). Holes for lashing are bored near the top of the carvings. Sizes fall within the same range as for the stern carvings under consideration (e.g., 22.8cm. for carving 7905, British Museum, and 56.7cm. for 276853, Field Museum of Natural History [Fig. 6]). Despite the presence of shared features, several factors argue for the place ment of the (hypothetical) stern carvings inside rather than on the outside of a canoe stern. Firstly, although four of the stern carvings also have holes bored along the upper bar, the holes are not as large as those on the "hanging boards" (Edge-Partington*s term) and would not accommodate ropes of substantial thickness. Furthermore, on three examples it is apparent that the function of these holes is for tying cowrie shells to the frame (Fig. 4). Ropes could, con ceivably, be wrapped around the upper portions of the frame to lash the carvings to the outside of a canoe, but the frames are flat, thin forms, usually embellished with detailed carved or painted designs which make them ill-suited for this purpose. Moreover, the frames show no signs of rope or other marks that continual rubbing of ropes against carved and painted decoration would produce, especially when aggravated by the motion of a canoe as it moves through the water. Secondly, the triangular low portions of the stern carvings, flat and undecorated in all but four cases (Braunschweig; British Museum 1957, Oc. 4,25; Australian Museum E24652, E24653), conform to the narrow triangular space inside the stern end of a canoe, but there is no reason why this shape alone should automatically preclude placement on the inside of the stern. However, the relative thinness of the triangular portions of the carvings, as well as the similarly thin frames and figures, seem rather delicate for placement in an exterior position just above the waterline, as with the "hanging boards", where they would rub against the canoes and be continually splashed and buffeted by the waves. "Hanging boards", by contrast, are thicker and sturdier; their ornamentation consists of a solid three-dimensional head projecting directly from the surface of the board, not slender figures silhouetted in the opening of a thin flat frame. Thirdly, the small frontally positioned figures sitting or standing within a</page><page sequence="9">CANOE STERN CARVINGS 55 frame would not be visible at any distance from the canoe. One of the marked features of canoe carvings fastened to the outside of canoe bows or sterns in this part of the Solomons is their visibility ? conveyed by pronouncedly three dimensional projecting forms and, frequently, a strong profile orientation of heads or figures. These observations suggest, then, that the carvings were placed in, rather than lashed to the outside of, canoe sterns, just as Edge-Partington originally stated. Even though he did not provide the sources of his information, it should be remembered that, like Woodford, Edge-Partington lived in the Western District as an officer of the British Colonial Government. He thus may have seen the ornaments there and inquired about them without necessarily recording the details of the inquiry. This lends slightly greater credibility to his written observa tions than would be the case for someone who never went to the islands. Style and Iconography The most reliable information indicating the regional origins of these canoe carvings is that which identifies them with a canoe type characteristic of Santa Ysabel, Guadalcanal, Florida, and Savo islands in the Central District. Similarly, the figures may be shown to possess stylistic features which correspond to already-established stylistic criteria for the region encompassing the Western and Central Districts (see Waite 1979a: 240-52). In addition, the images display a number of subtle formal variations that can only be explained by variations in time, island, or village. Rarely are these factors known. Only nine of the carvings possess specific recorded island attributions, and their validity cannot be ascer tained. They include three carvings attributed to Santa Ysabel (Auckland 15048, [Fig. 3], Melbourne X3169 and X3173), three allegedly from Savo Island (Basel Vb 6728; British Museum 1957, Oc.4, 22 and 23), and three with a Guadalcanal attribution (Sydney E24652, E24653, E24654). That a carving was acquired from an island does not necessarily indicate, however, that the carving was made on that island. Features shared by all of the anthropomorphic figures include frontality, laterally upraised arms, and varying degrees of facial prognathism (forward extension of the lower face). All of the figures are represented frontally; 17 stand and one (British Museum 1957, Oc.4.23) sits. The seated-displayed position of this figure has precise parallels among figures rendered on other canoe carvings and Tridacna clam-shell commemorative burial plaques. Laterally upraised arms which symmetrically flank and centre the figures also recur consistently among images depicted on the clam-shell plaques, other canoe ornaments, and shell inlaid wicker shields (see Fig. 7). The amount of facial prognathism ranges from extreme (e.g., University Museum 18220) to moderate for most of the figures. Some lack it entirely (e.g., B. M. 1957, Oc.4.23, 25; Australian Museum E24652). Prognathism is one of the most conspicuous features of wooden figures of all types from this region. In the New Georgia islands, this trait was one of several recorded as indicative of the spirit identity of figures (Somerville 1897:378). Bodies of the figures are decorated with incised lines, rubbed with white lime,</page><page sequence="10">56 DEBORAH WA?TE that represent armbands, bandoliers crossed over the chest (or shell currency?), and cicatrisation marks on the abdomen and thighs. The latter may represent frigate birds (Figs 1, 3), a common cicatrisation design in the Western and Central Districts of the 19th century, and visible on other images (Waite 1979b:227, figs. 131-132 and Somerville 1897:365). Any attempt to explain the symbolism of a group of carvings must rest on knowledge of the context within which the carvings function. That context, in the Solomon Islands of the Central and Western Districts, once involved head hunting ? warring raids for the sake of obtaining heads, which were not only valued for their power, but were also ritually necessary on occasions such as the inauguration of a new canoe or canoe house. A "cultural necessity' ' as well as a powerful means of revenge, the practice was outlawed by the British Colonial Government established in the Solomon Islands in 1893 (Woodford 1888:160; Paravicini 1931:179; Zelenietz 1983). Large decorated canoes were employed on head-hunting raids, particularly by New Georgia islanders, who conducted many aggressive raids against peoples living on the coasts of Choiseul, Santa Ysabel, Florida and, to a lesser extent, Guadalcanal. A number of canoe ornaments from this part of the Solomons, not surprisingly, had recognised head-hunting associations. Chief among these was the canoe prow figurehead which comprised the head, arms, and shoulders of an anthropomorph, sometimes holding a miniature head in its hands (Fig. 8). Some sources relate that the figureheads "represented" powerful spirits that protected the canoe occupants from other spirits that caused storms to capsize canoes in order that they might devour the occupants (Somerville 1897:371). Among the destructive spirits was one called Kesoko, directly linked with head-hunting in New Georgia mythology, and represented by a pair of carved heads or seated figures with large heads placed directly above the figureheads ? lashed to the tips of the upraised canoe prows (Waite 1979a and Beti 1977:40-6). Tridacna clam-shell ornaments called barava (Fig. 9), small triangular pieces of clam shell notched along the base, were fastened in rows along the length of upraised canoe prows in the New Georgia and Florida islands as well as Choiseul. They were also lashed, along with clam-shell rings, to sticks known in the New Georgia islands as serenbule that were placed inside or in front of miniature nuts containing the skulls of the deceased and were also taken out in canoes on head hunting raids (Lanyon-Orgill 1969:67; Waterhouse 1949:152; Girard 1963:214, fig. 2). Individual barava could also be worn suspended from the neck as charms. One example from Choiseul in the Solomon Islands Museum (69.24) was recorded to have been "worn on (the) breast when visiting (a) tambu house." Another (Solomon Islands Museum 72.160) fastened to a single shell ring, from Marovo, New Georgia Island, was a "magic charm used for asking for good weather, for burial sites, to prevent sickness, and for good fortune for head-hunting" (Museum file information). On New Georgia and neighbouring islands, barava-shaped designs were carved in relief on canoe ornaments (e.g., Gathercole et al. 1979:231, 15.12, 15.13), decorated skull house gables (e.g., St?hr 1972:180, Abb 427), and on a carved memorial plaque for Ingova, prominent leader in the Roviana Lagoon, New</page><page sequence="11">CANOE STERN CARVINGS 57 Georgia, until his death in 1906 (De Tolna 1903:331). They occur occasionally on fishnet floats and canoe prow figureheads. The canoe stern carvings under consideration here, with one exception (Pitt Rivers 3400), are adorned with rows of carved barava designs along the rectangular frames. Moreover, the prognathism of the heads of the figures, though minor in some instances, emphasises them in a manner comparable to that observable on other canoe ornaments including figureheads; one of the figures (Fig. 1) holds a small head in each hand. Ovulum shells are fastened in groups of four to the tops of two canoe stern carvings (Pitt Rivers 3400 and Otago D23.1002) in the position occupied by wooden three-dimensional barava carvings on other examples (British Museum 1951, Oc.4, 22, 23; Basel Vb 6788; Australian Museum E24654). These shells were, like the clam-shell barava, fastened to the upraised prows of war canoes from New Georgia. They also were lashed to the raised sterns of some canoes from Santa Ysabel (Woodford 1909: Plates XLIII and XLV). The dearth of specific information regarding meaning or interpretation of these objects is unfortunate. It may be proposed, however, that, when seen on one category of object, barava, miniature anthropomorphic heads, and formal elements of the figures such as prognathism, frontality, and upraised arms6 may have functioned as signs which, implicitly or explicitly, referred the viewer to their presence on other objects within the same or related contexts.7 Furthermore, these elements often appear as aggregates: frontal standing or displayed anthropomorphs with upraised arms, detached heads, barava, and birds in variable clusters on canoe carvings, battle implements, and commemorative burial plaques. These aggregates of signs served, visually, to associate different aspects of the world of the living with the world of the afterlife: people with the protective powers of human and non-human spirits of this world and the next; the life-destroying yet life-creating act of head-hunting in this life with the status of the head-hunter in both this life and the afterlife. A form of metaphoric visual substitution thus may have linked the canoe with the commemorative plaque as well as with the shield, the canoe ornament, and head-hunting charms (barava, serenbul?). Each could be identified with the other by virtue of shared aggregates of signs whose repetition communicated their intra-associational values, at least to those people who possessed the status and knowledge to recognise their significance, namely, the men of the communities. The levels of awareness for women and children are impossible to assess (but it is not unlikely that they were minimal). Thus, in spite of the lack of recorded infor mation about the canoe stern carvings, the sign aggregates which they share with other artefacts signify visually something of their former function within a common cultural context.

Carving Ial8 in the National Museum, Copenhagen, represents another canoe carving which has a figure within a frame on top of a triangular board but differs substantially in the type of figure, a three-dimensional seated image with large projecting head and arms extended forward to touch the chin. A pair of scrolls project laterally from a triangular portion of the carving. Barava designs are intricately worked into the elaborate low-relief carved patterns that cover the surfaces of the top and one side bar of the frame. Two Ovulum shells remain attached to the carving. The piece was obtained by the museum in 1864 and is attributed to Guadalcanal (Museum accession file information). 3. The carving belongs to the Edge-Partington Collection acquired by the Auckland Institute and Museum in 1925 through the generosity of Dr. T. W. Leys (Gordon Maitland, personal communication, 21/10/83). 4. Canoe carving 18220 belongs to the C. W. Voy-Cope Collection in the University Museum, acquired by the museum in 1891. The carving was thus collected before that date (Davenport, personal communication, 24/6/83). 5. In 1980 a binabina canoe was built in the traditional way at Haroro village, North Gela (Florida), as a project sponsored by the University of the South Pacific Solomon Islands Centre. It did not contain stern carvings of the type discussed here (see Pule 1983). 6. The earliest recorded canoe carving from the central part of the Solomon Islands is the canoe prow figurehead. It is first mentioned in the journals of Louis A. de Bougainville, who observed figureheads on two canoes from Choiseul Island in the summer of 1768 (Jack-Hinton 1969:255-61). 7. The upraised arm rendered by itself possessed a recorded culturally acknowledged "meaning" in the New Georgia islands. According to Woodford, an arm (called limambovo on New Georgia Island) was drawn on the side of a war canoe after a suc cessful head-hunting expedition. A white arm, if painted near the front of the canoe, reputedly indicated that male heads were taken; if near the stern, female heads were ac quired. A New Georgia canoe with arms painted on the sides referred to and illustrated by Woodford had been captured by Ysabel islanders following an attack from New Georgia about 10 years before Woodford viewed it on Santa Ysabel (Woodford 1909: 511, 513, Pl. XLI). People living on the south coast of Santa Ysabel through the end of the 19th century apparently had ample opportunity to observe canoes from New Georgia that came to Ysabel on head-hunting raids. 8. Ferdinand de Saussure, founder of the linguistic discipline of semiology, defined the sign as the "union of a form which signifies and an idea signified". This union, he declared, is arbitrary and cannot be explained by any intrinsic links between the object signified and the sound that signified it (Culler 1976:9-10). In semiology, language is analysed in terms of the system of basic elements (words) and the syntagms into which elements of the system combine. In a paper recently delivered at Columbia University (Waite 1983), I attempted to apply semiological analysis to art from the Solomon Islands, a process which required some adaptation for an art-historical framework. The elements of the sentence included basic iconographie and formal elements; the syntagmatic aggregates were the art objects themselves. Application of this</page><page sequence="13">CANOE STERN CARVINGS 59 methodology to a sample group of 425 artefacts from New Georgia, Choiseul, Santa Ysabel, and Florida revealed that the various elements which comprised the artefacts did indeed operate as signs and that this, in fact, was one of the diagnostic features of the art from this region. The general remarks made in the concluding paragraph of the present article are based on the much more comprehensive findings of the Columbia paper. REFERENCES Andr?e, Richard, 1891.
