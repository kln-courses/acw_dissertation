<plain_text><page sequence="1">SYMBIOSIS AND EVOLUTION IN BUTLER'S WORK 401 Maria Aline Ferreira Symbiotic Bodies and Evolutionary Tropes in the Work of Octavia Butler All successful life is Adaptable. Opportunistic, Tenacious, Interconnected, and Fecund. Understand this. Use it.?Octavia E. Butler, Parable of the Sower (124-25) The tropes of the parasite, the host, and the symbiont figure prominently in Octavia Butler's science fiction, much of which is fundamentally engaged with survival and adaptation strategies in hostile environments. These strategies entail the understanding and assimilation of otherness, in both the physical and personal spheres, as well as the negotiation and incorporation of hybridity as integral to the maintenance of life. In this context, infection and contagion must be navigated and coped with, as must hierarchies and violent drives. Butler's narratives are crucially about cross-species breeding and the evolutionary potential of such cross-fertilization. She rewrites human evolution in fiction, creating imaginative scenarios that radically recast the human future. The Xenogenesis trilogy, for example, is structured through tropes that revolve around issues connected with the evolution of the human species in a post-nuclear, post-ecocide world threatened with extinction. In order to forestall the imminent destruction of humanity, radical survival and adaptive strategies become necessary, even if the price to be paid entails the genetic modification of the species through the direct intervention of the alien Oankali. The humans' drive to survival and adaptation is a pivotal thematic concern in Butler's fiction, not only as far as power relations are concerned but also in terms of narratives of evolution, including the potential creation of new, mixed-species beings. With the instantiations in her work of mergings, hybrid fusions, and circulation of bodily materials, Butler's fiction anticipates in many crucial ways new developments in the biosciences. Bearing in mind this evolutionary lens, my argument will be structured around certain key words, in particular "symbiosis" and "parasite," and will concentrate on her early novels MindofMy Mind (19 ), Clay's Ark (19$4\ and M/d Seed (1978) as texts most clearly concerned with these thematic issues.1 Symbiotic Politics "To be one is always to become with many."?Donna Haraway, When Species Meet (4) In biological and evolutionary theories, the concept of symbiosis occupies a central location and it is one of the crucial structuring ideas in Butler's fiction. Lynn Margulis considers symbiogenesis to be a "fundamental fact of evolution" (Symbiotic Planet 33). As she explains:</page><page sequence="2">402 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 37 (2010) symbiosis is simply the living together in physical contact of organisms from different species.... Symbiosis is an ecological relationship.... Symbiogenesis, in turn, is an evolutionary relationship. It's symbiosis over time, such that a new feature can be recognized as a product of that symbiosis.... A long-term symbiosis can lead to new organs, new tissues, new behaviors?and that is symbiogenesis. ("Microbial Planet") This description can apply to many of the new liminal creatures in Butler's fiction, such as the hybrid beings in Clay's Ark, the progeny of humans and extraterrestrial organisms, as well as the human and Oankali offspring in the Xenogenesis books (Dawn [1987], Adulthood Rites [1988], and Imago [1989]). According to Margulis and Dorion Sagan, life "did not take over the globe by combat, but by networking"("Marvellous Microbes" 10); their stress is on cooperation.2 Indeed, symbiosis is based on collaboration between distinct entities for their mutual benefit. As Margulis puts it, "partners in symbiosis, fellow symbionts abide in the same place at the same time, literally touching each other or inside each other" ("Symbiotic Planet" 2). There are, however, many different forms of cooperation in both human and animal societies. Parasitism itself is, importantly, a version of symbiosis and it is a trope that informs large segments of Butler's work. According to Andrew Dobson, "parasites may well be the thread that holds the structure of ecological communities together." Referring to parasitism, Hartnett explains that in "parasitic interactions, one species lives on or within a host organism and receives nourishment from the host, whereas the host is harmed by the interaction," a dynamic familiar to readers of Butler's fiction.3 Butler has clearly drawn on these natural phenomena to structure the relations between and among a variety of her characters, explicitly describing them in terms taken from biology, including "hosts," "parasites," and "symbionts." In his influential study, The Parasite (1982), Michel Serres investigates the trope of the parasite in different registers, arguing that, since we "parasite each other and live amidst parasites" that "constitute our environment" (10), and given that "[w]e live only by relations" (234), human interactions themselves often follow a logic that structures the connections between host and parasite, host and intruder.4 According to Serres, the parasite "invades and occupies" (253) and its position is to "be between" (230). As Cary Wolfe states in his introduction to the most recent edition of The Parasite, what Serres describes as a parasitic "cascade" (5) forms the "ur-dynamic of social and cultural relations" (xv). This parasite logic is also highly visible in Butler's fiction as a fundamental survival strategy. Serres claims that humans parasitize animals to use them as food and raw material for clothes and other consumer goods, in what he sees as an instance of the co dependence of host and parasite, a seemingly inescapable chain of symbiotic reliance on the other, and also on nature, a chain which is recurrently thematized in Butler's writings.5 As Steven D. Brown remarks, the "uninvited guest" at the dinner table always brings about a "new form of complexity" and inevitably "engineers a kind of difference by intercepting relations" (16); this is a disruptive influence that will have to be negotiated with the host but which can also potentially bring positive side-effects.6</page><page sequence="3">SYMBIOSIS AND EVOLUTION IN BUTLER'S WORK 403 Extrapolating from these connections, Serres goes on to regard human relations as also part of this parasitic chain, since, as he argues, "we parasite each other to speak, to eat, to organize injustice and legal extortion... to reproduce and multiply" (230). This, in Serres's view, leads to another kind of parasitism, what Brown characterizes as an "asymmetrical, one-way relationship" (16) typified by a lopsided, uneven interaction. As Serres states: "The parasite invents something new. Since he does not eat like everyone else he invents a new logic. He crosses the exchange, makes it into a diagonal. He does not barter; he exchanges money" (35). Brown goes on to explain, with reference to parasitical dynamics between hosts and parasites, that either they incorporate the parasite into their midst?and thereby accept the new form of communication the parasite inaugurates?or they act together to expel the parasite and transform their own social practices in the course of doing so.... [H]ere then is the origin of human relations: the struggle to incorporate or expel the parasite." (17)7 This struggle is often conspicuously present in Butler's communities, which create their own dynamics to survive by either integrating or ejecting parasites. According to Serres, history hides the fact that man is the universal parasite, that everything and everyone around him is a hospitable place. Plants and animals are always his hosts; man is always necessarily their guest. Always taking, never giving. He bends the logic of exchange and of giving in his favour when he is dealing with nature as a whole. When he is dealing with his kind, he continues to do so; he wants to be the parasite of man as well. And his kind want to be so too. Hence rivalry. (24) For Serres, this is an anthropomorphic relation to nonhuman animals in which humans are always the takers, never the givers, "staying in a good position in irreversible logic" (25); he regards it as untenable, however. Rivalry leads to struggle and, inevitably, to hierarchy, an aspect of the human make-up strongly criticized by, for example, the Oankali in the Xenogenesis trilogy, who wish to excise that trait from the humans with whom they engage in genetic trafficking.8 While for Serres a human group is structured around "one-way relations, where one eats the other and where the second cannot benefit at all from the first" (5), in Butler' s fiction there are often examples of force-driven relations where the predators do not just parasitize the other, but offer some benefits in return, such as more vigorous health, a longer lifespan, and pleasurable feelings. What Butler seems to suggest is that only by allowing the more powerful aliens to steer evolution?even if it means allowing them to modify human bodies at the genetic, cellular level?will humans survive and adapt to their new surroundings. As Laura Bollinger notes, "taking Margulis's ideas seriously means envisioning selfhood that incorporates rather than excludes the other, and offers alternatives to selfhood as traditionally understood" (50). This is something that Butler crucially negotiates in her fictional scenarios. According to Bruce Clarke, in a related vein, humanity will "earn its continuation only by metamorphic integration into new evolutionary syntheses" ( 196), a vision that Butler repeatedly</page><page sequence="4">404 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 37 (2010) evokes in her cautionary tales, which take for granted not only Margulis's notion of symbiosis but also parasitism in its distinct manifestations. Haraway's insistence on the "inextricable weave of the organic, technical, textual, mythic, economic, and political threads that make up the flesh of the world" ("Cyborgs and Symbionts" xii) resonates strongly in Butler's scenarios.9 Drawing on the example of the microbe M. paradoxa, with its five different types of symbionts, living in "various degrees of structural and functional integration with their host," Haraway describes all such creatures as living in a type of "obligate confederacy." She argues that they are all "opportunists ... nested in each other's tissues in a myriad of ways that make words like competition and cooperation, or individual and collective, fall into the trash heap of pallid metaphors and bad ontology" ("Cyborgs and Symbionts" xviii). This is another model of interrelations that bears similarities to some of the social and physical couplings that structure Butler's communities.10 Predators and Parasites. Mind of My Mind (1977), the second book in the Patternist Series, makes abundant use of the tropes of host and parasite. Doro, one of the protagonists, is an immortal shapeshifter, consistently described as both a parasite and a cannibal. He survives by consuming both his victims' psychic energy and their bodies, literally wearing their bodies and discarding them when they are no longer useful. He does not have a body of his own, unlike Anyanwu, his powerful counterpart in Wild Seed, whose original form is the young female she naturally reverts to. Doro is thus a consummate parasite.11 Mary, the female protagonist, is one of Doro's daughters, a telepath and a healer. Repeatedly described as a kind of parasite who knows instinctively when she has to feed because of hunger, she is a different but related "female Doro" (Mind of My Mind 361). Mary, like Anyanwu in Wild Seed, is a healer, regarded as "not human" (414) because of her powerful, unusual talents; she is also a "predator" (419) who collects other people to form her community. She is like a "mental queen bee" (391), a "kind of mental vampire draining strength ... or something from people" (350).12 Unlike Doro, however, who is recurrently portrayed as a "vampire" (441), Mary operates more altruistically, since, as she explains, "I give in return for my taking" (441). Mary is also described as an "experiment" (346), one of Doro's most successful telepathic beings, instrumental in his long-standing project of building a new people, a new race. Indeed, "for all but the first few centuries of his four-thousand-year life, he had been struggling to build a race around himself (266). While Doro's origins seem to be connected to a mutation several millennia ago, his people existed as a result of less wildly divergent mutations and as a result of nearly four thousand years of controlled breeding. He now had several strong mutant strains, which he combined or kept separate, as he wished. And behind him he had an untold number of failures,... which he had destroyed as casually as other people slaughtered cattle. (266) Like a "parasite" (383), Mary has to "feed" (382) on other people, imbibing their "life force" (350) and in the act depleting their energy. It is precisely through this method that Mary manages to destroy Doro, by absorbing the energy of many</page><page sequence="5">SYMBIOSIS AND EVOLUTION IN BUTLER'S WORK 405 of the members of her group. Mary's powers turn out to be even stronger than Doro's and in a final, decisive battle between them, Mary wins and takes over the seemingly indestructible and immortal Doro. She then goes on to extend the community of telepathic beings she has started to assemble?a large number of people who effectively constitute a new breed. Doro's dream is fulfilled through Mary, but, like Anyanwu, she does not kill unless in order to create a peaceful society where people can develop their gifts and achieve personal fulfilment. Mary's parasitism works both ways, benefiting herself but also her hosts and prey, while Doro's parasitical activities have often led to his prey's death, with no mutualistic advantage. Mary is giving Doro a united people, a group finally recognizable as the seeds of the race he had been working to create.... But they were not a people he could be part of. As Mary's pattern brought them together, it shut him out. Together, the 'Patternists' were growing into something that he could observe, hamper, or destroy, but not something he could join. They were his goal, half accomplished. (392) In Clay's Ark, the third of the Patternist series, it is suggested that "a new order... a new species" (624) will arise, this time brought about by infection with an extraterrestrial organism. The alien organisms in Clay's Ark fit the pattern described by Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene (1976), according to which humans are the hosts of genes whose interest it is to keep the former alive in order to survive and replicate. In this gene-centered view of evolution advocated by Dawkins and fictionally dramatized by Butler, the alien organisms that have infected the crew of the spaceship Clay's Ark rule Eli's body and behaviour. Eli, the only survivor of a spaceship crash and the sole person responsible for bringing the extraterrestrial organism to Earth, is described as a "prisoner within his own skull, cut off from conscious control of his body" (Clay's Ark 480). Eli feels completely at the mercy of this form of life that has parasitized him, unable to contain his impulse to infect others, a compulsion that effectively corresponds to the urge of the organism to replicate and find new hosts. Indeed, he has "an unconscious will to survive that transcended any conscious desire, any guilt, any duty to those who had once been his fellow humans" (470). Eli realizes that if he confesses what is happening to him he will be kept in isolation, in which case he will be "prevented from doing the one thing he must do: seeking out new hosts for the alien microorganisms that had made themselves such fundamental parts of his body. Their purpose was now his purpose, and their only purpose was to survive and multiply" (481; emphasis in original).13 Indeed, as we further learn, "all his increased strength, speed, coordination, and sensory ability was to keep him alive and mobile, able to find new hosts or beget them. Many hosts" (481). In accordance with the "selfish gene" theory, the microorganisms that had infected Eli "became intensely uncomfortable" (481) if he did not find other hosts, and "their discomfort was his discomfort" (481). Moreover, he might interpret what they made him feel as pleasure when he did what was necessary, desirable, essential: or as pain when he tried to do what was terrifying, self-destructive, impossible. But what he was actually feeling were secondhand</page><page sequence="6">406 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 37 (2010) advance-retreat responses of millions of tiny symbionts. (481; emphases in original; last emphasis mine) Eli further explains the etiology of the alien organism and its effect on human bodies in evolutionary terms of adaptation and survival, with added benefits in resistance to diseases or death: Surviving hosts became utterly resistant to more conventional diseases and more efficient at performing certain specialized functions.... Not surprisingly, the human body had no defense against it. But in time the organism changed, adapted, and chemically encouraged its host to adapt. Its by-products ceased to be toxic to its host and the host ceased to react as strongly to increased sexual needs and heightened sensory awareness?inevitable effects of the disease. The needed time was bought by new organisms of the same disease?new organisms introduced after significant adaptation had occurred. (494; emphases mine) Eventually, those new organisms "simply became part of the original invasion, and the host, the patient, was no better, no worse" (495).14 In Donna Haraway's words, the invaders in Clay's Ark "have become an intimate part of all the cells of the infected bodies, changing human beings at the level of their most basic selves" ("Biopolitics" 226). Blake, a medical doctor captured together with his two daughters by Eli's people and who ends up infected, attempts to identify the alien organism with an analyzer. As he explains to his daughter Meda, what the analyzer describes from the samples of her sweat and skin are "unidentifiable microbes" (497). The screen shows him tiny, spiderlike organisms in her flesh, some of them caught in the act of reproducing along with her cells?as part of her cells. They were not viruses. According to the computer, they were more complete, independent organisms. Yet they had made themselves at home in human cells in a way that should not have been possible. (497; emphasis in original) Blake further considers that "These were more complex organisms that had sought out higher game than bacteria and managed to combine it without killing it. They had changed it, however, altered it slightly, subtly, cell by cell. In the most basic possible way, they had tampered with Meda's genetic blueprint. They had left her no longer human" (497-98). As Eli explains to another infected woman: "You need to infect a man and have children and you won't get any peace until you do.... The organism is a damned efficient invader.... We've lost part of our humanity. We can lose more without even realizing it. All we have to do is forget what we carry, and what it needs" (543). This challenge to keep one's humanity and identity in the face of profound genetic manipulation inflects the vexed question of the limits and frontiers of humanity that runs insistently through Butler's work. In Clay's Ark, the humans infected with the extraterrestrial organism (which gives them extra sensory powers) generate, when they interbreed, mutant, animal-like offspring. Eli and Meda's son is described as a freak, an animal who runs on all fours, on whom Eli desperately longs to bestow the "gift of humanity that children everywhere else on Earth took for granted" (594), while Meda explains to Blake that "we're</page><page sequence="7">SYMBIOSIS AND EVOLUTION IN BUTLER'S WORK 407 holding on to our humanity by our fingernails" (497).15 In Dawn (1987), the first of the Xenogenesis novels, the humans who are genetically modified by the alien Oankali also try to cling to any remnants of humanity they still possess, anything that distinguishes them from those they perceive as animal-like in their appearance and behaviour.16 In many crucial ways, Butler is also prophetically envisaging genetic therapies and cross-species breeding that are set to develop exponentially in the next decades. At the same time she taps into the widespread anxieties those biotechnologies elicit, evoking the feelings of abjection and revulsion that are interpreted by some scientists and ethicists as suggesting that we are perilously approaching a "slippery slope" from which there will be no return.17 According to Eli, musing on the consequences of the alien infectious agents on humans: "We're the future.... We're the sporangia of the dominant life form of Proxi Two?the receptacles that produce the spores of that life form. If we survive, if our children survive, it will be because we fulfill our purpose?because we spread the organism" (607; emphasis in original). As Sherryl Vint argues, the infected humans in Clay's Ark are "ultimately ideal nomadic subjects, so resistant to the grid of channelled desire and identity formation that even the limitation of species is transcended" ("Becoming Other" 298). Butler's narrative seems to suggest that in the context of evolutionary scenarios of the emergence of a post-humanity, only by adapting to new situations, on Earth or in the realm of space colonization, will humans have a chance of survival, of working towards recovering their humanity or, by adapting to their new circumstances and bodily configurations, of achieving a modus vivendi and a modicum of fulfilment. Discussing new modes of reproduction, Myra J. Hird argues that "in evolutionary and species survival terms, human beings most resemble viruses which also survive by colonizing, and then consuming, new territories" ("Re[pro]ducing Sexual Difference" 104).18 This is reminiscent of Serres's remarks, which fittingly apply to the alien organism that infects more and more people in Clay's Ark. If, on the one hand, these new genetic fusions are presented as inevitable in a future world, however, they remain ambiguously coded in Butler's work, as Laura Bollinger also maintains. Bollinger reads the novel as expressing "ambivalence rather than terror" (43). The alien and hybrid nature of so many of Butler's characters functions as a biopolitical strategy for adaptation and survival?forgoing part of their sense of humanity is the only option that gives them a chance to continue living. Connected with this recurring anxiety about the loss of humanity is the fear of penetration and invasion or infection by the alien other, the tinkering with genetic identity at the molecular level. This scenario is also at the center of Butler' s story, "Bloodchild" (1984), which narrates a similar symbiotic politics involving parasite and host. In order to survive, the humans in "Bloodchild" have to agree to a symbiotic relation with the alien Tlic. This includes, in the case of the human males, carrying the Tlic's offspring in their bellies, so that they become in effect pregnant, surrogate fathers to alien progeny. Butler herself emphasizes that what she is writing about in "Bloodchild" is "symbiosis" (qtd. in McCaffery 56) and that the humans "survive as a species but not unchanged" (qtd. in McCaffery 64). As Brigitte Scheer-Sch?zler observes in relation to "Bloodchild," "in</page><page sequence="8">408 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 37 (2010) mythologizing the parasitic insects ... as a form of life wanting as well as providing survival for itself and for its host, Butler rejects the binary model of thinking as in colonizer or colonized, victimizer or victim, life or death" (319). This is an anti-essentialist template that is operative in Butler's work as a whole. Wild Seed: Metamorphosis, Sorcery, Becomings. To borrow Haraway's terminology, Butler's fiction has been, from the start, crucially about "significant otherness" (Companion Species Manifesto 3) and "otherworldly conversations" ("Otherworldly Conversations" 125). This translates into an interest in the possibility of communication with alien others and the awareness of the inevitable presence of the alien in ourselves, as well as in shapeshifting and metamorphosis, gene trading and versions of genetic engineering, all present in Butler's fiction. These themes also include a concern for a greater awareness of bodily capacities, for looking inside one's body with a view to understanding its inner functioning, and how to profit from that knowledge in order to influence it to heal itself and to heal others. These issues, although represented in virtually all of Butler's work, are particularly emphatic in Wild Seed, in the characters of Anyanwu and Doro, who can be seen, to a certain extent, as protogenetic engineers in their creation and transformation of themselves and of other people. Indeed, as in Wild Seed, shape-shifting can be interpreted as a fantasy version of hybridization that can be partially, at least, concretized through genetic engineering and new medical practices such as xenotransplantation. In Wild Seed, the first novel of the Patternist series in terms of the chronological order, Doro?an immortal being who kills other people by taking over their bodies in order to survive?is described as the initiator of a new breed of telepathic beings, some of whom have special healing powers. For Doro, everything revolves around his breeding programs, which he has been trying to implement and improve, without much success, for around four thousand years. Only when he finds Anyanwu, the immortal healer and shapeshifter, does his breeding program significantly improve, since Anyanwu possesses to a great degree the "strengths of nurturing, community building, healing, and teaching," as Sandra Y. Govan stresses (300), skills which he lacks. As Doro reasons: "He would use her for breeding and healing. He would use her children, present and future, to create more acceptable long-lived types. The troublesome shape changing ability could probably be bred out of her line if it appeared" (98).19 Anyanwu, like the hybrid creatures in Clay 's Ark, has much sharper senses than normal humans and her curative powers have led to her being considered a witch; she is respected but also feared. After all, sorcery, healing, and shape-shifting have always been linked in the popular imagination. Indeed, these borderline, liminal creatures that populate Butler's fictional worlds exhibit many affinities with the sorcerer or witch, figures that haunt the margins, that stand at thresholds and are perceived as the carriers of contamination and contagion, holding power over life and death. For Gilles Deleuze and F?lix Guattari, the concepts of becomings-animal, sorcerer, or witch are closely connected, as these are figures that encompass notions of power,</page><page sequence="9">SYMBIOSIS AND EVOLUTION IN BUTLER'S WORK 409 anomaly, and boundary crossing.20 Deleuze and Guattari describe becomings animal as residing not in an animal one imitates or to which one corresponds but in themselves, in that which suddenly sweeps us up and makes us become?a proximity, an indiscernibility that extracts a shared element from the animal far more effectively than any domestication, utilization, or imitation could. (279; emphasis in original) For Deleuze and Guattari, sorcerers "have always held the anomalous position, at the edge of the fields or woods. They haunt the fringes.... The important thing is their affinity with alliance, with the pact, which gives them a status opposed to that of filiation" (246). This is a definition that fits Doro's actions particularly well. Deleuze and Guattari further consider that "in sorcery, blood is of the order of contagion and alliance" (247) and they suggest that becoming-animal is closely connected with sorcery or, as in Anyanwu's case, with witchcraft, given the extraordinary powers she uses to heal and also to take other forms, both human and animal. Indeed, Anyanwu can metamorphose into whatever life form she wishes, as dramatized in her becoming a dolphin.21 This is a strategic move to escape Doro's power, but also a liberating experience that shows her alternative animal realms and how well she can fit into them. As Anyanwu expresses it, "she was a dolphin" (212) and she feels completely at ease swimming with the dolphins. She even considers, for a moment, having intercourse with a male dolphin. As she ponders, "now seemed to be a time for strange meetings" (92). The dolphin, which Anyanwu chooses to embody, claiming that "They are like people" (Wild Seed 99), is described by Mette Bryld and Nina Lykke as a "perfect boundary figure... radiating non-aggression, compassion, spirituality and intelligence" (168), characteristics that also apply to Anyanwu and help explain her longing to merge with them. Dolphins are directly opposed to what Doro stands for: violence, power, control, and hierarchy. The relationship between Anyanwu and Doro is often couched in terms of predator and prey. As Anyanwu muses in her dolphin state, Doro "would not enslave her again. And she would never be his prey" (212). The predator, the host, and the parasite are fundamental figures in Butler's "menagerie of figurations" (How Like a Leaf 135), to use Donna Haraway's words again?creatures that enact endless struggles for adaptation and survival. Reflecting on what she calls "extended bodies" (75) and on the "perspectival question" (75) of what can be considered as self and/or other, Haraway observes that "from the point of view of the parasite the host looks like part of itself; from the point of view of the host the parasite looks like an invader" (75). As Haraway puts it, "disease is a relationship" (75), since the host and the parasite or other infecting agent have to recognize each other, a condition that is emphatically dramatized in Clay's Ark. Contagion. Deleuze and Guattari's discussion of the idea of contagion in A Thousand Plateaus seems particularly relevant to the study of the biological relations established among many of Butler' s characters, in particular the infected beings in Clay's Ark, whose actions inevitably spell contagion. Deleuze and</page><page sequence="10">410 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 37 (2010) Guattari regard contagion as an exemplary instantiation of becomings that would disturb the traditional order of filiation: We oppose epidemic to filiation, contagion to heredity, peopling by contagion to sexual reproduction, sexual production. Bands, human or animal, proliferate by contagion, epidemics, battlefields, and catastrophes.... Unnatural participations or nuptials are the true Nature spanning the kingdoms of nature. Propagation by epidemic, by contagion, has nothing to do with filiation by heredity, even if the two themes intermingle and require each other. The vampire does not filiate, it infects. The difference is that contagion, epidemic, involves terms that are entirely heterogeneous: for example, a human being, an animal, and a bacterium, a virus, a molecule, a microorganism. (241-42) According to Deleuze and Guattari, "these combinations are neither genetic nor structural; they are interkingdoms, unnatural participations" (242), terms directly applicable to the varied human/non-human mixtures in Butler's fiction. For Deleuze and Guattari, "these multiplicities with heterogeneous terms, cofunctioning by contagion, enter certain assemblages; it is there that human beings effect their becomings-animal" (242; emphasis in original). They go on to discuss the pack, which they describe as "simultaneously an animal reality, and the reality of the becoming-animal of the human being; contagion is simultaneously an animal peopling, and the propagation of the animal peopling of the human being" (242). In this context, the different communities in Clay's Ark appear to conform to Deleuze and Guattari's definition of these "dark assemblages, which stir what is deepest within us" (242) and which they contrast with such institutions as the family or the State apparatus. Organized around "alliance and contagion, pact and epidemic" (247), the Clayarks are borderline creatures who correspond to what Deleuze and Guattari depict as an "entire politics of becomings-animal, as well as a politics of sorcery, which is elaborated in assemblages... [that] express minoritarian groups, or groups that are oppressed, prohibited, in revolt, or always on the fringe of recognized institutions, groups all the more secret for being extrinsic" (247). In Patternmaster (1976), the first novel published in the Patternist series, the Clayarks are consistently described in animalistic terms, like the creature the protagonist, Teray, comes across, "human-headed, and almost lion-bodied" (680), moving with the "easy grace of a cat" (680). The Clayarks call themselves "sphinxes" (641), and, as Teray realizes, they are much more "sphinxes? creatures who were at least partly human?than they were the animals" (641) he had always thought they were. The Clayarks can be inscribed in Butler's menagerie of liminal creatures; they function as a pack and enlist their symbionts by contagion.22 As Deleuze and Guattari comment, "pack and contagion, the contagion of the pack, such is the path that becoming-animal takes" (243).23 In this context, Serres argues that some small groups, even though appearing to behave like pests, can turn out to be crucial actors in a given society by providing (bio)diversity, despite following a parasitical model, even if in terms of the power relations involved there is always asymmetry and distortion?as is the case with with the Clayarks, the Oankali, and the Patternists.</page><page sequence="11">SYMBIOSIS AND EVOLUTION IN BUTLER'S WORK 411 Conclusion. The ubiquitous strategies of survival and adaptation dramatized in Butler's writings can be described in terms of achieving, in Luciana Parisi's words, "contagious transmission rather than filiali ve heredity ... mutual engineering rather than addition of parts" (32), in a cooperative rather than hierarchized interactive structure.24 Within this framework, Butler's fiction is permeated with evolutionary tropes conducive to change, adaptation, and survival in a post-Darwinian world, mediated through such figures as the parasite, the host, and the symbiont, with which this essay has been specifically concerned. Indeed, according to Margulis's blunt summary: "we are symbionts on a symbiotic planet" (Symbiotic Planet 5), a view dramatized in Butler's narratives. Butler expresses the need for changes in the way the world functions, saturated as it is with inequality, poverty, and hierarchical divisions. Her insistence on themes around the creation of a new genus suggests that only through drastic means, such as bioengineering and strategic fusions with other species, can solutions for humanity's continued existence and survival be envisaged, even though these may mean radically different embodiments and, in the distant future, travelling to and settling on other planets.25 The texts I have briefly looked at here provide future alternative paradigms and resources to reflect on the potential innovative social and reproductive scenarios made possible by biotechnology. In Butler's own words: "Where are we going? What sort of future are we creating? Is it the kind of future you want to live in? If it isn't, what can we do to create a better future? Individually and in groups, what can we do? ("A Conversation" 341). In Bioethics in the Age of New Media (2009), Joanna Zylinska advocates a new nonhumanist bioethics that defies the "hierarchical system of descent through which relations between species and life forms have traditionally been thought" (177), in line with the rhizomatic biopolitics proposed by Deleuze and Guattari. It is precisely in this area that Butler's work presciently operates, making a strong case for such a bioethics through the resources of narrative fiction.26 In her critical utopias, Butler negotiates with imaginative vigor some of these contested future becomings, boundaries, and fusions in an era destined to witness increasing biogenetic capitalism and a highly charged genetic imaginary. NOTES 1. These three novels are part of Butler's Patternist series, which also includes Patternmaster (1976) and Survivor (1978). For an overview of the role of parasites in science fiction, see Sinclair and Stableford. 2. As David C. Hartnett explains: An interaction is considered a symbiosis based on the closeness of the physical association among the organisms rather than on the effect or outcome of the interaction. Symbiotic relationships span a spectrum from beneficial to detrimental effects. Many people associate symbiosis with mutualism, interactions that are beneficial to the growth, survival, and/or reproduction of both interacting species. But symbiotic interactions also include commensalism (one species receives benefit from the association and the other is unaffected), amensalism (one species is harmed, with no effect on the other), and parasitism, (emphases in original) 3. Hartnett further observes that it is</page><page sequence="12">412 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 37 (2010) perhaps the most common type of symbiotic interaction in nature.... Many kinds of worms, protozoa, bacteria, and viruses are important animal parasites.... A variety of parasitic symbionts also occur in plants. Symbioses are widespread and important in the life of many organisms and ecologically important in the functioning of natural ecosystems. The patterns of adaptations of mutualists, parasites, and hosts suggest that these interactions are the product of coevolution, leading to increasingly specialized, and often increasingly beneficial, associations, (emphasis in original) 4. For the origin of the term "parasite," see Carl Zimmer's Parasite Rex. 5. As Steven D. Brown remarks, in Serres's book the "asymmetrical relation of 'taking without giving' is the basis for a model of parasitism that applies equally to information theory and the history of human relations" (3). 6. Eating, food preparation, and the equitable distribution of food are recurrent themes in Butler's work, inextricably connected with survival strategies and community building. This emphasis on food is particularly apt in the context of a discussion of parasitism in Butler's work, since the meaning of the term "parasite" is closely linked to the idea of eating next to someone with whom you share a meal. As Serres explains, to "parasite means to eat next to" (7). 7. As Isabella Winkler observes, the parasite "arrives as a contaminant from beyond the border, compromising the integrity of the host at whose expense it feeds" (228). 8. In Bodies of Tomorrow, Sherryl Vint analyzes the interbreeding practices of the Oankali as well as the multiple ramifications of their interactions with the humans (56-78). 9. As Haraway further asserts, Margulis and Sagan "provide a historical narrative with a future that is full of metamorphoses." For Haraway, "'our' bodies are indeed weedy and promiscuous" ("Cyborgs and Symbionts" xvii), features strongly reminiscent of bodies in Butler's fiction. 10. As Margulis and Sagan put it, "with the elapse of time, the internal enemies of the prey evolved into microbial guests, and, finally, supported adoptive relatives" (What is Life? 71). 11. In her Alien Constructions, Patricia Melzer reads the characters Doro and Anyanwu predominantly in terms of gender transgression. See also Melzer's '"All That You Touch You Change.'" 12. Indeed, Mary's husband Karl suggests to her that she is "exactly the kind of parasite" (383) Doro himself also described her as. 13. As Alison Sinclair observes, parasitism is typically regarded with distaste, with a mixture of horror and ambivalence, and science fiction has consistently portrayed parasites as having an "extraterrestrial or unnatural origin" (587). In Haraway's words, Butler's work is all about negotiating new but necessary and inevitable "promiscuous mixings and fusions" ("Cyborgs and Symbionts" xii); her stories are about enforced collaborations and compromises. 14. Stableford describes the ambivalent human/alien relations in Clay's Ark in terms of commensalism (913), in which one organism benefits from its association with another without damaging it. 15. See Vint's "Becoming Other" for an examination of the trope of kinship in Clay's Ark. 16. As Laura Bollinger remarks, however, for some writers symbiogenesis can provide a "model of ideal human interaction, despite the threat to individual selfhood resulting from the new plural identity." Bollinger points to Joan Slonczewski' s Brain Plague (2000) as providing "An image of individuality by incorporation that seeks to retain both identities" (45). 17. See, for instance, J. Weinberger's "What's at the Bottom of the Slippery Slope?"</page><page sequence="13">SYMBIOSIS AND EVOLUTION IN BUTLER'S WORK 413 18. Susan Squier raises an important point when she considers the ethical and philosophical consequences of different types of sexual reproduction, including interspecies reproduction. For Squier, "sexual reproduction is only one, and arguably not even the predominant, kind of reproduction that is found in nature; bacterial budding, rhizomic replication, spore production, viral infection, symbiosis, bacterial recombination ?such reproductive models challenge not only our humanness, but also (and perhaps more profoundly), our animalness" (374; emphasis in original). See also Luciana Parisi' s Abstract Sex: Philosophy, Bio-Technology, and the Mutation of Desire and Hird's Sex, Gender and Science for feminist discussions of sexual diversity and the multifaceted density of nature. 19. Quotations are from the original edition of Wild Seed (1988), rather than from the Seed to Harvest compendium (2007). 20. Vampires are also part of this congeries of creatures, as in Butler's last novel, Fledgling (2005). 21. Robin Roberts writes of Anyanwu that "her intimate self-knowledge allows her to cure herself and others in ways unknown to doctors and scientists. Through Anyanwu, Butler suggests that the key to a productive and energizing immortality is self-knowledge and self-awareness" (141). 22. As vampires, the Ina in Fledgling can also be inscribed in this collection of liminal creatures. 23. As they describe it: packs, or multiplicities, continually transform themselves into each other, cross over into each other. Werewolves become vampires when they die. This is not surprising, since becoming and multiplicity are the same thing.... [I]t amounts to the same thing to say that each multiplicity is already composed of heterogeneous terms in symbiosis, and that a multiplicity is continually transforming itself into a string of other multiplicities, according to its thresholds and doors. (249; emphasis in original). 24. Parisi is drawing on Lynn Margulis's notion of symbiogenesis and her endosymbiotic theory (SET?Serial Endosymbiotic Theory). 25. In this respect, see also Sandra Grayson's discussion of Butler's Xenogenesis trilogy in Visions of the Third Millennium (2003). 26. As Haraway insists in The Companion Species Manifesto: "I believe that all ethical relating, within or between species, is knit from the silk-string thread of ongoing alertness to otherness-in-relation. We are not one, and being depends on getting on together" (50). WORKS CITED Bollinger, Laura. "Symbiogenesis, Selfhood, and Science Fiction." SFS 37.1 (Mar. 2010): 34-53. Brown, Steven D.

ABSTRACT This essay examines the tropes of the parasite, the host, and the symbiont in Octavia Butler's early novels Mind of My Mind (1977), Clay 's Ark (1984), and Wild Seed (1978). These figures can be seen as directly implicated in and representative of the evolutionary and adaptive strategies operating in Butler's fiction. The essay engages predominantly with Michel Serres's analysis of parasitism in its multiple facets as well as Donna Haraway's investigation of symbiotic relatedness, two thematic areas that receive detailed attention in Butler's work. Butler's fictional elaboration of altenative future paradigms of connectedness negotiates the potentially positive aspects of genetic fusions and symbiotic alliances, achieved with recourse to versions of genetic engineering techniques and novel bioscientific developments that Butler has anticipated in many crucial ways. While expanding on some putatively beneficial scenarios arising as a result of these new biotechnologies, her fiction also sounds a cautionary note about the dangers inherent in the dilution of human embodiment and subjectivity that might occur as the outcome of as yet unforeseen inter- and intra-species mergings.</page></plain_text>
