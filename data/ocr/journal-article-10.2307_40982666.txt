<plain_text><page sequence="1">HermeneuticS/ 'BY DAVID COUZENS HOY In the nineteenth century hermeneutics was a branch of philosophy concerned principally with methodological ques- tions about how to acquire correct understanding and in- terpretation of texts. In the twentieth century hermeneutics grew into a broader philosophical field as a result of its resist- ance to tendencies in philosophy toward objectivism, scientism, or positivism. When used for polemical purposes, these latter terms do not necessarily identify specific philosophical posi- tions. In one of the most recent hermeneutical works in this polemical genre, Jürgen Habermas's Knowledge and Human Interests,1 these labels indicate a tendency of philosophers as diverse as Comte, Mach, Marx, Peirce, and even Dilthey to exempt their own theories from the need for critical self- reflection. In other words, philosophies that construe them- selves as investigating or even supplying the foundations or rational grounds for the sciences often fail to question and to account for their own theoretical and epistemological status. This failure may be built into the very conception of philosophy as foundationalist, since the philosophy that thinks of itself as foundation or ground thereby assumes for itself the achievement of a timeless and unconditionally valid perspec- tive. Despite the rejection especially by the early positivists of absolutist metaphysics, their own theories of knowledge and explanation are set out as if methodologically absolute. From such an absolutist standpoint, of course, the hermeneutical self-reflection that takes seriously the likelihood of any scien- tific or philosophical theory being supplanted by another looks like historicism (or historical relativism). What otherwise quite diverse philosophers like Husserl and Carnap have in com- mon is the view that philosophy should itself be "rigorous Jürgen Habermas, Knowledge and Human Interests (Boston: Beacon Press, 1971).</page><page sequence="2">650 SOCIAL RESEARCH science," to use Husserl's phrase, and that anything falling short of this is irrational. A target for Husserl's critique is Dilthey, or at least Dilthey- like philosophers who maintain history to be a succession of incommensurable Weltanschauungen. Dilthey's related attempt to distinguish the Natur- from the Geisteswissenschaften eventually puts hermeneutics in opposition to logical empiri- cism, which insists on the essential unity of science and on a univocal conception of knowledge and explanation in all the sciences. In contrast, hermeneutics insists that understanding (Verstehen) cannot be reduced to explanation, or at least to the deductive-nomological model of explanation in the physical sciences. Just as understanding a person or a text seems dif- ferent from having knowledge about things, the social and human sciences which study persons and texts appear to re- quire a different methodology from that of the natural sci- ences. The task of explaining this difference has its difficulties. Before philosophers became accustomed to speaking of a cir- cular relation between theories and data in the physical sci- ences, hermeneutics seemed forced to agree with logical em- piricism that in these sciences there is a sharp distinction between theoretical and observational statements such that the former are verified by the latter. Hermeneutics is thereby put in the awkward position of having to argue both that the same does not hold in other disciplines and- that these are never- theless "sciences." The Hermeneutic Circle Central to this argument is the claim that the study of human behavior and institutions by humans themselves is cir- cular in a way that the study of nature is not. In an article reflecting on Haber mas's Knowledge and fiurnan Interests, Mary Hesse identifies this "hermeneutic circle" with what English philosophers call the paradox of analysis:</page><page sequence="3">HERMENEUTICS 651 Just as a paradox seems to arise when more precise logical or conceptual tools are used to analyse ordinary vague usage of language, because the product of such analysis is not then iden- tical with what was analysed, so in a much more general sense a "hermeneutic circle" arises when the language, categories, and frameworks of our own culture are used to interpret and under- stand alien texts, alien cultures and even other individuals and groups in our own culture or society. This is because the lan- guage and thought forms we are studying are not in themselves intelligible without interpretation, but our own language and thought forms are not adapted to fit them, therefore interpre- tation is always problematic and accompanied by distortion.2 The problems for the study of human societies and cultural artifacts in all their diversity and even alienness arise because of the need to interpret them in terms of our own standpoint, from which we can never entirely free ourselves. Of course, we cannot free ourselves from our physical and biological natures either, but that does not indicate that our study of physical and biological nature is relative to our nature. The important claim must be, then, that humans' access to their own states and activities (presumably in such a way that they have some influ- ence over these) makes the study of these states and activities different from the study of physical nature. Attacks on the logical empiricists' distinctions between fact and meaning, observation and theory, came from many sides. Finally the most influential criticisms were made by those who were concerned not with defending the Geisteswissenschaften but with showing that the relation between theories and data is circular even for the physical sciences themselves. Charles Taylor, a leading proponent of hermeneutics, parodies the present hermeneutical scene by pointing out that these dis- tinctions, and the entire gap between the Natur- and the Geisteswissenschaften, seem to disappear once we realize that the logical empiricists sold us an extraor- dinary bill of goods about natural science. Once we awaken 2 Mary Hesse, "In Defence of Objectivity," Proceedings of the British Academy 54 (1972): 275-292, at p. 276.</page><page sequence="4">652 SOCIAL RESEARCH from our positivist slumbers we realize that none of these fea- tures hold of natural science either. The two turn out to be methodologically at one, not for the positivist reason that there is no rational place for hermeneu tics; but for the radically op- posed reason that all sciences are equally hermeneutic. This is an extraordinary reversal. Old-guard Diltheyans, their shoulders hunched from years-long resistance against the en- croaching pressure of positivist natural science, suddenly pitch forward on their faces as all opposition ceases to the reign of universal hermeneutics.3 Showing that theory choice is underdetermined by the evi- dence may indicate that there is some hermeneutic under- standing of prior practices (that is, some of what Gadamer4 calls Vorurteile y or prejudgments, including one in favor of the tradition) involved in the actual development of science. But contrary to other commentators on hermeneutics, principally Mary Hesse in the article just cited and Richard Rorty in his new book, Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature5 (particularly in chapters 7 and 8), Taylor thinks it is wrong to conclude that there is not still an essential difference between the natural and the human sciences. Given this divide between the two kinds of science, which Taylor does not want to collapse, the human sciences continue to be threatened (and will perhaps be so perennially) by the neighboring physical sciences. There is still a strong drive (based on good but, for Taylor, wrong reasons) toward mak- ing the human sciences conform methodologically to the natu- ral sciences, a drive coming from within the human sciences themselves. The temptation is to try to give descriptions of human behavior and institutions which satisfy the requirement Taylor thinks is the real key to the success of the natural sciences. The "requirement of absoluteness" (a phrase bor- rowed from Bernard Williams's Descartes: The Project of Pure 3 Charles Taylor, "Understanding in Human Science," Review of Metaphysics 34 (September 1980): 25-38, at p. 27. 4 Hans-Georg Gadamer, Truth and Method (New York: Seabury Press, 1975). 5 Richard Rorty, Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1979).</page><page sequence="5">HERMENEUTICS 653 Enquiry) is the demand that an adequate scientific account avoid giving descriptions including subject-related properties, that is, what the seventeenth century called secondary as op- posed to primary qualities. The question is not whether this requirement can be waived for the natural sciences but whether it should be imposed on the human sciences. A likely initial reaction, one with which Taylor will finally agree, is that while it is fine to free physics of anthropomorphism, there is something wrong about want- ing to do the same for the human sciences. To understand people seems naturally to be able to give an account of them with what Taylor calls, following Anscombe, desirability characterizations, that is, in terms of their wants, needs, and desires. These are terms any individual would use in a self- description, and would thus seem appropriate in any explana- tion of that individual's states and activities. Human understanding involves self-understanding, and to eliminate the latter by avoiding desirability characterizations would indeed seem to make a human science hopelessly in- adequate. What is the alternative? Taylor thinks that there are also strong arguments for imposing the absoluteness require- ment. Contrary to the naive behaviorism of Skinner (criticized by Taylor in his first book, The Explanation of Behavior), this can be done without abstracting entirely from subjective expe- rience. The absoluteness requirement is met simply by distin- guishing reality and subjective experience, capturing the former in an objective description of the individual's situation and the latter in a "colorless" addition that the individual has either a pro or a con attitude toward that state of affairs. The first, obvious advantage of such descriptions is meth- odological, for they permit objective, quantifiable analysis. The second advantage goes beyond this "scientistic reflex" and is quite significant in that this impartial description satisfies the requirement of value freedom. "One of the strong reasons for sticking with absolute descriptions," says Taylor, "is that they seem to offer the hope of intersubjective agreement free</page><page sequence="6">654 SOCIAL RESEARCH from interpretive dispute."6 Many desirability terms seem opaque, and terms like honor or integrity may not feature in times or cultures other than our own, or even in subsets of what we take to be our own. (Taylor takes misunderstandings among people to be a central feature that the hermeneutical sciences must take into account. It would be a mistake to explain away this feature by assuming that misunderstandings are only peripheral and that people everywhere and always share a basic, common, commensurable ground which, if fully understood, would lead to the elimination of misunderstand- ing. Like many other hermeneu tic theorists, Taylor thus takes a certain incommensurability to be a genuine possibility and an ineluctable fact of human affairs.) The irony of the two alternatives between which the human sciences are torn is that each declares it does more justice to human freedom. The "old-guard Diltheyans" wish to preserve freedom by saving the human sciences from the tendency of the natural sciences to reduce everything to causal explana- tions and thus to deny freedom. Within the particular human sciences, however, researchers tend to impose natural science's absoluteness requirement precisely to avoid distortions caused by implicit valuations. The scientific study of values, said Weber, can itself be value-free. While this declaration is prob- lematic, its intention is clear, namely, to avoid endless disputes about how to interpret incommensurable desirability characterizations by making possible intersubjective agreement about results valid for everybody and replicable by all compe- tent researchers. This Peircean notion of consensus is important for other hermeneutic theorists as well. Habermas, for instance, main- tains that every cognitive discourse presupposes counterfactu- ally that truth claims could be resolved in an ideal, constraint- free speech situation. Truth would be identical with ideal intersubjective agreement. Taylor's paper brings out a further 8 Taylor, "Understanding in Human Science," p. 36.</page><page sequence="7">HERMENEUTICS 655 condition Habermas might resist, namely, that such agreement is made more likely if the effect of hermeneutical self- understanding is minimized by narrowing it down to colorless accounts of pro or con attitudes. The ideal of intersubjective agreement would probably not be realizable, then, unless the human sciences continued to ignore the old-guard Diltheyans and impose the requirement of absoluteness. It must be stressed that Taylor himself does not believe the absoluteness requirement ought to be applied in the human sciences. His earlier article, "Interpretation and the Sciences of Man,"7 challenges the appropriateness of the ideal of inter- subjective agreement for the study of man and society, given that incommensurability of communicative ideals seems possi- ble and conflict of interpretations inevitable. Taylor would thus probably side with Gadamer in rejecting Habermas's be- lief that a counterfactual, ideal consensus is a necessary regu- lative ideal of all discourse. Taylor's argument in the present context is only that the collapse of logical empiricism would not entail the collapse of the distinction of the natural and human sciences into a universal hermeneutics, as he thinks Rorty and Hesse infer. Actually, as a more recent paper than the one Taylor con- siders makes clear, Hesse herself is in fact willing to admit to significant diffef enees between the two kinds of science. In "Theory and Value in the Social Sciences,"8 she maintains that the social sciences differ precisely in that they do not have a single criterion for theory choice as the natural sciences do. Whereas the latter function for the most part with the prag- matic criterion of predictive success, the former can be guided by a variety of value goals. Rather than being like a natural 7 Charles Taylor, "Interpretation and the Sciences of Man," in Paul Rabinow and William M. Sullivan, eds., Interpretive Social Science: A Reader (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1979), pp. 25-71. 8 Mary Hesse, "Theory and Value in the Social Sciences," in Christopher Hookway and Philip Pettit, eds., Action and Interpretation: Studies in the Philosophy of the Social Sciences (London: Cambridge University Press, 1978), pp. 1-16.</page><page sequence="8">656 SOCIAL RESEARCH scientist's explanation, a social scientist's evaluation of the data in terms of a social theory will be more like taking a stand in politics. Hesse's account still might not satisfy Taylor, however, since the difference between the sciences would be one of degree rather than of kind. Hesse does not emphasize whether the difference is essential or not, but Rorty is quite willing to continue disagreeing with Taylor by denying that there is an essential difference of kind. The paper by Taylor under dis- cussion was presented on a panel at the 1979 meeting of the Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy, and Rorty9 responded both to it and to a paper by Hubert Dreyfus.10 Rorty challenges the rationale of applying the ab- soluteness requirement to the human sciences not because human beings would thereby be misdescribed, but rather be- casue it is a mistake to think that the absoluteness requirement is the key to the success of the natural sciences. In drawing a distinction between terms that are subject- related and terms that characterize things independently of observing subjects, Taylor seems to Rorty to be reviving the very notion hermeneutics opposes, namely, correspondence to absolute reality. For Rorty "Taylor's inference from 'the world exists independently of human percipients' to 'the world must be understood in terms which reflect this' cari make sense only if one can offer examples of terms which don't reflect this." From a pragmatist perspective Taylor's advocacy of the abso- luteness requirement is guilty of a hasty inference from "I can get what I want out of X by thinking of it as Y" to "X is in itself a Y," a move motivated by another non sequitur going from "nature's causal independence of thought to the need for subject-independent terms." The real difference between primary and secondary qualities is for Rorty, then, only the 9 Richard Rorty, "A Reply to Dreyfus and Taylor," Review of Metaphysics 34 (Septem- ber 1980): 39-46. 10 Hubert L. Dreyfus, "Holism and Hermeneutics," Review of Metaphysics 34 (Sep- tember 1980): 3-23.</page><page sequence="9">HERMENEUTICS 657 pragmatic one between "terms useful in scientific explana- tion and terms not so useful." To understand the motivation of Rorty's reply it is helpful to understand his position in Philosophy and the Mirror of Na- ture. He labels his own stance hermeneutics, but is explicit that he does not think of hermeneutics as a method (as Dilthey does, for instance, in speaking of it as the method of the human sciences, or as Habermas does in distinguishing the her- meneutical from the natural sciences on the one hand and the "critical" sciences on the other). Rather, he reads Gadamer as saying that hermeneutics is an attitude, and precisely the anti-Cartesian, anti-Kantian attitude of giving up the idea of method. Rorty's interest in hermeneutics is metaphilosophical in that he construes it as offering, not a positive program, but only a critique of traditional epistemology. Epistemology may suc- ceed in capturing what goes on in normal science or normal discourse, but hermeneutics is required when crises or in- commensurabilities are encountered and discourse becomes "abnormal." In the Kantian tradition epistemology is con- ceived as a foundationalist enterprise - one that attempts to separate knowledge from other forms of belief in order to ascertain what is objectively certain. In contrast, hermeneutics rejects the idea that the primary task of philosophy is to supply foundations and guarantee certainty. It sees knowledge as pragmatically relative to contexts of understanding. The paradigm of the phenomenon of understanding is the in- terpretation of texts, and hermeneutical theory maintains that while there is no reductionistic fact of the matter to be prop- erly or improperly represented by interpretations, neverthe- less there are determinate constraints on what gets taken as proper or improper interpretation. These constraints are internal to the purposes and goals of the interpretations, and are not the conclusions of a transcendental theory that supplies the conditions for criticism, or that acts as the univer- sal commensurating discourse for all possible discourses.</page><page sequence="10">658 SOCIAL RESEARCH Different Paradigms If epistemology (theory of knowledge) and hermeneutics (theory of understanding) have evolved into competing views about what philosophical theories can do, the reason may be simply that they have traditionally been preoccupied with dif- ferent paradigms. Extremely condensed and oversimplified, the traditional notion of knowledge presupposes (1) a privileged standpoint as the guarantee of certainty; (2) per- ception as the paradigm case; (3) the atemporal truth of in- stances of knowledge claims; and (4) the impotence of reflec- tion to disrupt self-evident tenets. In contrast to each of these four points, hermeneutics maintains that understanding is al- ways interpretive, and therefore that (1) there is no uniquely privileged standpoint for understanding; (2) reading rather than seeing is the paradigm case of the phenomenon of understanding; (3) understanding changes, and thus in- terpretations require continual reexamination; and (4) any interpretive understanding is laden with self-understanding, however implicit, so that changes in the latter eventuate in changes in the former. The importance of hermeneutical philosophy for the sci- ences is different when conceived by Gadamer and Rorty in this metaphilosophical manner than when proffered by Dil- they as a method. More in the spirit of Dilthey, for instance, Paul Ricoeur argues in a paper originally published in this journal that the social sciences are hermeneutical both because their object, meaningful human comportment, is in central respects like a text, and because the method of the social sciences is essentially that of reading and interpreting these text-analogues.11 While this analogy permits Ricoeur to make significant philosophical amendments to Dilthey's overly psy- chological model, every analogy has its limitations, and this way of construing hermeneutics can be misleading. The social 11 Paul Ricoeur, "The Model of the Text: Meaningful Action Considered as a Text," in Rabinow and Sullivan, Interpretive Social Science, pp. 73-101.</page><page sequence="11">HERMENEUTICS 659 scientist may well balk at the fashionable poststructuralist sug- gestion (which is not what Ricoeur is proposing) that what is being studied are not real actions and institutions but texts. Hermeneutics should avoid turning textuality into a universal model, since this would be to take a metaphor as a method. Forgetting that it is a metaphor may even lead to thinking that hermeneutics is offering a new ontology - a monadology of texts. In order not to misinterpret Ricoeur's talk about texts, one must keep in mind that his main concern is in fact only the Diltheyan one of distinguishing social-scientific methods from the classical causal model. Despite his rejection of Dil- they's notion of empathy and his substitution of the notion of reading, however, his proposal that the hermeneutic circle is inevitable in the human sciences disinters Dilthey's old prob- lem. He himself asks whether he has not thereby legitimated the intrusion of personal prejudice or subjective bias into scientific inquiry, undermining it as "science." His only re- sponse in the conclusion of this paper is to say that "we are not allowed to exclude the final act of personal commitment from the whole of objective and explanatory procedures which mediate it." Even if this statement means that the bias can itself be made an object of inquiry, Ricoeur still has not ex- plained why it should follow that if a bias has or has not been identified, social reality or the real world has thereby been disclosed or not. He still seems drawn to saying both that there is a real world that is properly or improperly disclosed, and that a proper conception of method will ensure this disclosure. That inference is precisely the one the Rorty-Taylor debate brings into focus as the central issue in current hermeneutics. The other participant in this debate, Hubert Dreyfus, intro- duces another set of considerations which will divide her- meneutical philosophers and influence how they see the rela- tions between the sciences.12 Dreyfus distinguishes "theoretical holists" (like Quine, Davidson, and Habermas) from "practical 12 Dreyfus, "Holism and Hermeneutics."</page><page sequence="12">660 SOCIAL RESEARCH holists." Theoretical holists reject the notion of objectivity traditionally used to separate the natural from the social sci- ences, and Dreyfus thinks the extreme but logical outcome of this denial is Feyerabend's view that the only difference be- tween the sciences is that the battle of interpretations is per- mitted in the human sciences but repressed, for no good reason, in the natural sciences. The philosopher's task then becomes the metainterpretive one of saying how understand- ing and translation between variously incommensurate in- terpretations of reality are even possible. "Understanding" is construed by theoretical holists as grasping beliefs or sets of beliefs (theories), and "interpretation" then means translation between theories, and possibly between conceptual frame- works. Practical holists, including Dreyfus and Heidegger, reject the claim that all understanding is theoretical. Practical under- standing may involve making implicit beliefs or hypotheses explicit, but doing so would be possible only in determinate contexts and against a background of shared practices. People are brought up within their own background of practices and, contrary to the theoretical holist, this background can never be completely articulated in a theory. Dreyfus does not mean, however, that the background of practices is ineffable. The inability of theory to represent these practices is due to two factors. First, practices involve bodily skills, which are not rep- resentable simply as beliefs and rules. Second, the background is too pervasive to be an object of analysis. For Dreyfus, then, the principal difference between the sciences is that "the human sciences, unlike the natural sci- ences, must take account of those human activities which make possible their own disciplines." If Dreyfus is correct, however, the social sciences may be irrevocably entrapped in a version of the hermeneutic circle. As theoretical disciplines they "must take account of' and "explore" the background of practices when at the same time the background cannot be "spelled out in a theory."</page><page sequence="13">HERMENEUTICS 661 Of course, if the background escapes articulation not in principle but only in practice (an intermediate position Dreyfus attributes to Gadamer), the difference between theoretical and practical holism would not be substantial. The nonrepresentability of skills and the pervasiveness of the background is for Dreyfus, however, a matter of principle. As a consequence (one he accepts willingly), the social sciences will always find themselves embroiled in a conflict of in- terpretations. Or if they did not, they would thereby be con- formist, complacent, and sterile. Debate about the kinds of beings we are is natural to beings like ourselves. Dreyfus joins Taylor, then, in thinking of humans as "self-interpreting" (or, they could say, hermeneutical) animals. Taylor and Dreyfus thus think there is an essential difference between the natural and the human sciences, and that the latter would be severely impoverished if this difference were overlooked. Rorty disagrees, and believes Taylor is making a mistake in insisting that there are two basically different kinds of beings, things and persons (a distinction sometimes ex- pressed as that between being-in-itself and being- for-itself). Taylor thus seems to preserve the metaphysical nature-spirit distinction as the ground for that between the natural and human sciences. The motivation for doing so, of course, is to save man by showing that human action can never be pre- dicted and controlled by human science. Science will fail to predict because man is a self-defining animal capable of al- tering its own nature. For Rorty, this way of affirming human freedom is philosophical overkill. Even if physicalism were successful and could come up with complete descriptions of the microstructural conditions of such basic human actions as the production of verbal noises, there would still be an in- commensurability between the language expressing the physi- cal processes and the language in which the noise means something. Rorty wishes to drop the nature-spirit distinction altogether as a needless carry-over from metaphysics, and prefers to</page><page sequence="14">662 SOCIAL RESEARCH follow the later Heidegger and the later Dewey in suggesting that there is no human "essence" or "reality" to be altered. Man's purported redefining of himself is simply a matter of his understanding himself in different terms. Redescribing human beings, says Rorty, means only that "new and more interesting sentences become true of them."13 All we have is change of vocabulary, not change of essence - not because essence does not change, but because there is finally nothing more to be expected than change of vocabulary. The dif- ference between the natural and the human sciences now, for us, is merely the line "between that portion of the field of inquiry where we feel rather uncertain that we have the right vocabulary at hand and that portion where we feel rather certain that we do."14 The former portion now corresponds to "spirit" and the human sciences, whereas the latter applies to the physical sciences, but Rorty does not see any necessary reason why the situation could not be reversed in the future. He is thus imagining an inverted world where the human sciences are in a period of normal science, and the natural sciences become as "abnormal" as, for instance, literary crit- icism is today. Understanding and Explanation There are other ways, however, both to capture the her- meneutical insistence on the circularity between human nature and humans' study of this nature, and at the same time to maintain that there is nevertheless no radical difference in kind between the sciences. In a recent double issue of Dialéc- tica devoted to the theme of understanding and explanation, the papers by Stanford philosophers J. M. Moravcsik and Dagfinn Fjzfllesdal argue against a difference in kind, but for 13 Rorty, Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature, p. 351. 14 Ibid., p. 352.</page><page sequence="15">HERMENEUTICS 663 opposed reasons.15 They both diminish the distance between the humanist and the scientist, but whereas Fjzfllesdal argues that humanists use the scientists' paradigm method of knowl- edge acquisition, Moravcsik works in the opposite direction and argues that understanding proofs, sentences, and expla- nations is not intrinsically different from understanding people. A theoretical holist (to use Dreyfus's term), Fjzfllesdal be- lieves that human states and activities can be adequately repre- sented for explanatory (although not predictive) purposes. In contrast, Moravcsik, like Dreyfus and the hermeneutic school, maintains that understanding is distinct from explanatory knowledge in the important respect that it involves a non- propositional component. Unlike Dreyfus, however, Moravcsik does not base his case on phenomena like bodily skills or the pervasiveness of background practices. For Moravcsik the theory-practice distinction is beside the point since he thinks understanding is different not only from theoretical, propositional knowledge (kno wing-that), but also from practical knowledge (know-how). To show that recent analytic epistemology is misguided in construing all significant cognitive states including understanding as combinations of knowledge and belief, Moravcsik argues that even theoretical cognitive states like understanding proofs, sentences, theorems, games, and strategies involve more than knowing- that and knowing-how. In the case of understanding proofs, for instance, an agent could have all the relevant knowledge about the proof including knowledge of its premises and rules, how it is produced, and even how it is applied to different instantiations, and yet still not understand the proof: "The agent might not be able to see the significance of the proof, its consequences, alternative ways of proving the same conclu- sions, or the agent might lack intuitions concerning the vio- 15 J.

Moravcsik, "Understanding," Dialéctica 33 (1979): 201-216; Dagfínn F^lles- dal, "Hermeneutics and the Hypothetico-Deductive Method," Dialéctica 33 (1979): 319-336.</page><page sequence="16">664 SOCIAL RESEARCH lations of [the rules] in contexts other than the proof in ques- tion." Although understanding involves nonpropositional ingre- dients like the ability to recognize rule violations - ingredients which are often implicit or unconscious - it is not thereby noncognitive. Like most contemporary hermeneutic philoso- phers, Moravcsik rejects Dilthey's notion that humanistic understanding is a matter of the empathy needed to project oneself into strange situations or to know "what it is like to be" another person. We cannot know what it is like to be Oedipus, says Moravcsik, and yet we can nevertheless understand Oedipus in the sense of obtaining a unique construal of the person (or the drama). Fjzfllesdal also does not appeal to psychological empathy to account for the understanding of other people. Unlike Moravcsik, however, Fjzfllesdal thinks this understanding can be explicitly expressed using the methods of the natural sci- ences plus some other tools like decision theory, game theory, and certain assumptions about the rationality of agents. Fjzfl- lesdal's main concern in this article is to show that hermeneu- tic theorists like Habermas are wrong in thinking that the humanities and social sciences do not use the hypothetical- deductive method of the natural sciences. Fjzfllesdal attacks Habermas by offering a counterexample from a discipline least likely to be thought "scientific" in the narrow sense, namely, literary criticism. He examines how five different in- terpretations of Peer Gynt are put forth and tested by various critics to see what consequences follow from the hypotheses about the significance of the "Stranger" who appears rather mysteriously twice in the fifth act. The primary difficulty with Fjzfllesdal's argument is that he construes the hypothetical-deductive method in a nonstandard way. Defined simply as the formation of hypotheses and the deduction of consequences to arrive at well-supported beliefs which fit in with our other well-supported beliefs, the "method" would of course be one used in other disciplines. In</page><page sequence="17">HERMENEUTICS 665 fact, these procedures would be so general as to be applicable in most aspects of life, and thus it would be misleading to call them a "method." Fjzfllesdal's definition of the method leaves out at least two important features normally attributed to it by the logical empiricists: (1) the law-like character of the hypotheses for- mulated in the natural sciences; and (2) the deductive stringency of the resulting explanations. Considering the first, Fjzfllesdal's Peer Gynt examples do not demonstrate any law-like hypotheses. Indeed, such a hypothesis is unlikely given that for the logical empiricists explanations in the natural sciences are nomothetic and not idiographic, which means that they explain types of events rather than unique, nonrecurrent events. For this reason, historians (including literary histo- rians) resist the suggestion that since they do not formulate laws of history (or of artworks), they are not explaining the unique objects or events they study. To accommodate the explanation of human agency and historical events, the deductive-nomological model can be modified to include probability considerations. Even this modification does not waive the second feature, namely, the fact that natural scientific explanations do not admit of the variety of nonconcurring explanations Fjzfllesdale allows in- sofar as he presents five more-or-less-plausible interpretations of the same occurrence. For the positivistic philosophers Habermas and others oppose, deduction is not simply a matter of fitting as many as possible of our well-supported beliefs together into a coherent whole. Rather, explanation is the deduction of an explanandum statement describing the phe- nomenon in question from an explanans including not only a set of singular statements about initial conditions but also a set of general laws. Fjzfllesdal does point out that there are some differences between the natural sciences and other disciplines. A principal one is the circularity between theories and data. This must be for him only a difference of degree and not of kind, however,</page><page sequence="18">666 SOCIAL RESEARCH since he thinks the circularity holds to a small extent in the natural sciences as well. In developing this thought, he brings in an example, not from the disciplines in question, but from moral philosophy. While a positivist would therefore rule out this as an example of "scientific" explanation, F^Hesdal's comment is especially interesting for a survey of the scope of hermeneutics. He is suggesting that what hermeneutics calls the hermeneutic circle is the same as the important procedure John Rawls in A Theory of Justice calls reflective equilibrium. We go back and forth between our intuitions and our theories, changing not only the latter but also the former, until we arrive at an equilibrium between our principles and our actual judgments. This equi- librium is reflective in that we come thereby to an explicit understanding of the principles that are functioning as prem- ises of our judgments. (Gadamer describes the phenomenon as one of making our Vorurteile - our prejudgments or even prejudices - conscious, and thereby perhaps modifying or re- jecting them.) While Rawls is thinking primarily about moral, practical reasoning, a footnote to Nelson Goodman implies that this procedure of mutual adjustment occurs in the sci- ences as well. Of course, in ethics we never actually reach reflective equi- librium, according to Rawls. We could never examine all the relevant evidence, descriptions, and arguments, whatever it might mean to do so. Rawls's recognition that the interplay is perpetually ongoing is consistent with the hermeneutical in- sistence on the open-endedness of self-understanding and self-interpretation. Even within hermeneutics, however, there are those who worry that talk about indefinite open-endedness is dangerously relativistic, and even nihilistic. What troubles many about the tendency of hermeneutics toward historicism is the apparent abdication of any critical role for philosophy over against the sciences, both natural and human. Habermas expresses this worry about Gadamer's theory, and both Dreyfus and Taylor see it in Rorty's book. The danger of such</page><page sequence="19">HERMENEUTICS 667 abdication is thought to be not only that science will fall into crisis if the status of its truth is not clarified, but that the absence of philosophical insistence on the spiritual side of man will endanger human freedom itself. Historicistic hermeneu- tics is thus perceived (by Dreyfus, for instance) as dangerous because we become unable to ask, in both a factual and a moral sense, what makes good science good. (This criticism of historicism also goes back to Husserl's 1910 essay, Philosophy as Rigorous Science.) Transcending (&lt;Whiggishnessff Traditionally philosophy has conceived itself as providing the basis for critical assessment of society and its sciences by claiming for itself a privileged standpoint, exempt from the tooth of time. Kant, for instance, thus labels his philosophy both transcendental and critical. Is historicist hermeneutics en- tirely free of the strong grip of "epistemology"? Some com- mentators think that Gadamer, for instance, manifests a ves- tige of transcendental philosophy insofar as he insists on the universality of hermeneutics.16 Now Rorty is advocating a more thorough-going historicism, but one which he admits at the end of his book to be frankly "Whiggish" insofar as it sees the past culminating in the superior knowledge of the present: The fact that hermeneutics inevitably takes some norm for granted makes it, so far forth, "Whiggish." But insofar as it proceeds nonreductively, and in the hope of picking up a new angle on things, it can transcend its own Whiggishness.17 Although hermeneutics does not claim to be constructive but only deconstructive, it must begin work somewhere. That is, it starts from within some particular discourse, the one it takes 16 See, however, David Couzens Hoy, The Critical Circle: Literature, History, and Philosophical Hermeneutics (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1978) and "Taking History Seriously: Foucault, Gadamer, Habermas," Union Seminary Quarterly Review 34 (1979): 85-95. 17 Rorty, Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature, p. 321.</page><page sequence="20">668 SOCIAL RESEARCH to be "normal" at the time. But Rorty's thought is probably that this discourse need not collapse other discourses into itself, or reduce everything strange and alien to some common ground (which it already knows in advance because the com- mon ground is its own). Understanding a foreign culture, for example, would be impossible if one were to "insist on Whig- gishly interpreting it as holding 'too many' of our own beliefs and desires."18 Another example of how hermeneutics can transcend its own Whiggishness comes from Thomas Kuhn, whose his- toriographical work started much of the debate about incom- mensurability and scientific revolution. In the recent au- tobiographical sketch presented as the preface to The Essential Tension, Kuhn attributes his sudden break from standard views about the history of science and about the nature of historiography to his "discovery of hermeneutics."19 Con- sciously or not, all good historians are, he thinks, practitioners of the hermeneutic method, which he formulates in the fol- lowing maxim: When reading the works of an important thinker, look first for the apparent absurdities in the text and ask yourself how a sensible person could have written them. When you find an answer, . . . when those passages make sense, then you may find that more central passages, ones you previously thought you understood, have changed their meaning.20 While this advice may be valuable to historians, however, there is still a philosophical problem about how to adjudicate the conflicts between our own beliefs and the apparently ab- surd ones of past thinkers. How can one theory be judged better than another if the criteria for theory choice are them- selves internal to theories? One way philosophers can deal 18 Ibid., p. 349. Debate about this problem in the methodology of the social sciences can be found in Bryan R. Wilson, ed., Rationality (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1977). 10 Thomas S. Kuhn, The Essential Tension: Selected Studies in Scientific Tradition and Change (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1977). 20 Ibid., p. xii.</page><page sequence="21">HERMENEUTICS 669 with this question has been clearly expressed by Alasdair Maclntyre.21 To avoid the dangers of Kuhn's notion of scien- tific revolution but also to preserve the historical insight, Maclntyre argues that we must construe both our scientific theories and our histories as true. We can do so insofar as our theories take account of earlier theories, which could not themselves account for ours. In other words, a historicist can maintain a theory of theories according to which a theory is not simply a conceptual arrangement of the given. A theory is implicitly hermeneutical in that it is also a historical account of itself since it tries to comprehend and include its predecessor theories. It explains them by showing how their internal in- consistencies are only equivocations for them, but not neces- sarily for the subsequent theoretical formation that can ac- count for the inconsistencies. The adequacy of a theory's im- plied history of its predecessors is a criterion of its own validity and legitimacy. The test of this approach will be, of course, its value in reconstructing actual theories. For present purposes it can be taken as an example of a strongly Whiggish answer to the question about the source of criteria or standards which justify one theory or paradigm over others. Kuhn's and Rorty's posi- tions are more weakly Whiggish than Maclntyre's. For Kuhn the criteria of choice between theories function only as values which influence but do not determine choice. Are there strictly scientific (and not, for instance, theological or social) standards for theory choice? Kuhn himself supplies the usual list: accuracy, consistency, scope, simplicity, and fruitfulness; but none of these is decisive. He does not give an explicitly negative answer to the question whether there is a way of ruling out apparently rational resistance to new theories as "illogical" and "unscientific." Rorty, however, is quite willing to give a definite negative response. It seems anachronistic to him to expect the Cardinals who objected to Galileo to realize 21 Alasdair Maclntyre, "Epistemological Crises, Dramatic Narrative, and the Philosophy of Science," The Monist 60 (1977): 453-472.</page><page sequence="22">670 SOCIAL RESEARCH what considerations would determine the sorts of evidence there could be for statements about the movements of planets, and thus to accuse them of being illogical and unscientific. What "scientific" means was precisely in the process of being formed. Of course, we cannot now throw off the demand to be scientific (although "reverse Whigs" like Feyerabend and Foucault may want us to do so). Rorty is neither discarding the notion of objectivity nor, following Kuhn's reply to his critics, reducing judgment to matters of taste. Rather, he is accepting the consequences of his own pragmatism. The only real use the notion of objectivity has, he argues in his book, is as agreement or consensus of rational discussants, not as mir- roring or correspondence.22 If this is all "objectivity" means, then "subjectivity" only means "unfamiliar to us." "We," of course, will always take the success of normal science or dis- course as evidence that we are understanding better, or coping better with what really is there. This apparent concession to realist intuitions should be taken, however, not as a sign of our having the transcendental truth, but simply as telling what Rorty describes as a "coherent causal story about our interac- tions with the world."23 However formulated, then, historicism and some degree of Whiggishness are not inconsistent. There is no necessary in- compatibility between insisting on the likelihood of our own theories being superseded and at the same time affirming the superiority of our theories to others we can understand. Fur- thermore, this Whiggishness can be transcended through the hermeneutical awareness obtained by the contrast with other, perhaps strange ways of thinking. The contrast can force us to become conscious of, and possibly to realize the inadequacy of, our own norms and standards. There may be finally no real philosophical problem about what makes good science good. Even if no transcendental set of norms and standards exists 22 Rorty, Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature, p. 337. "Ibid., p. 341.</page><page sequence="23">HERMENEUTICS 671 which all inquiry shares, that is, even if norms and standards are internal and relative to particular theories or discourses, there is no reason to think inquiry could not be self-critical. Science will arbitrate and evaluate itself as good or not in terms of its own successes or shortcomings. For philosophy to think it needs to supplement the scope of science with the scopeless claim that successful prediction is identical to mir- roring nature's and human nature's secrets is a needless addition - one that takes philosophy beyond its own historically delimited scope. Contrary to what unhermeneuti- cal philosophy maintains, it is not science so much as philosophy conceived as "rigorous science" which has failed to reflect upon itself and to clarify the nature of its own under- standing.</page></plain_text>
