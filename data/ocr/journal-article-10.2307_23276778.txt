However, beyond this subjective aesthetic lure lie the social practices of the communities that created these representations. The figurative vases that characterise the MBA period at Phylakopi on Melos and Akrotiri on Thera present just such a challenge, of seeing past the aesthetic to the original social contexts of production and consumption. Of particular interest is the seemingly sudden boom in figuration, enhanced by the explicitly anthropomorphic or zoomorphic qualities of many of the vases in question. This boom occurs together with the innovative use of other media for figurative representation, an interplay that underlines still further the need to understand the social conditions of production and consumption of these artefacts. While much scholarly work has been devoted to the study of the formal qualities, origins and symbolism of the pictorial motifs attested on Middle Cycladic (MC) vases, as well as the interplay with units and compositions on other comparable material culture assemblages, such as seals and wall paintings,1 much less attention has been devoted to their social contexts of production and use; this paper seeks to redress the balance. First, the material evidence is presented, with specific emphasis on the formal attributes and the articulation of pictorial units and the qualities of their host materials, the ceramic containers. Then, this distinct production phenomenon of the two Cycladic communities, Akrotiri and Phylakopi, is further accentuated by setting it against the wider context of related practices in the contemporary MBA of the southern Aegean. Finally, focusing on Akrotiri as a case study, we take a glimpse into the integrated role of iconographical vases and associated activities in the particular social context that fostered this remarkable production. MC ICONOGRAPHY: THE MATERIAL EVIDENCE MC iconography is basically restricted in the present state of the data to evidence from ceramic material. The first excavators of Phylakopi were obviously impressed by the variety and naturalism of iconographic motifs, especially in the later period of the MBA. Similar material was uncovered at Akrotiri, substantially enriched with the retrieval of large ceramic assemblages during the excavations of the foundation trenches for the pillars of the new shelter of the site. Since the intimate relation of the MC pottery of the two sites is clearly evident, it is reasonable to follow the artistic conventions and the stylistic development along parallel lines in their ceramic production from the beginning to the end of the MBA period. The end of the EBA and the beginning of the MBA signifies the consolidation of nucleated settlement for the inhabitants of Melos and Thera. Phylakopi and Akrotiri emerge as prime settlements and probably also as peer polities in the southern Aegean. The ceramic production of the two sites converges stylistically in the use of dark-on-light wares with geometric motifs on a range of similar functional types. At Phylakopi, dark-on-light geometric motifs are usually depicted on a whitish slip on brown fabrics, while at Akrotiri a change in technology from reddish/brown EC fabrics launches a long series of buff to white fabrics in MC and LC ceramic production. Figurative motifs are introduced in vase painting at both sites during this particular period, conventionally called in the ceramic sequence of each site Phase B at Phylakopi and Phase A at Akrotiri.2 These motifs include human figures depicted in a very stylised manner, characterised by * This paper is presented to P. M. Warren as a small token of gratitude to the teacher who supervised my first steps in archaeological scholarship with unfailing support and encouragement.

Akrotiri, Thera: fragments of a barrel jar with human figures and fish. the absence of detailed depiction of facial features, hair, clothing and most importantly sex attributes (fig. 21.1).3 There are minimal indications of movement or engagement of the figures, with few exceptions. Similar observations apply to the depiction of animals, which are represented as the generic forms of species, mainly fish and quadrupeds (fig. 21.1), and possibly also birds.4 There is again little indication of action or intentional movement, a feature further emphasised by the strict syntactic rules imposed by the organisation of decorative space in panels. Curiously for island communities, and especially considering the relevant EC iconographic tradition, boat depictions are rarely found so far on the pottery of this period.5 Dark-on light figurative motifs are mainly found on large closed vessels, especially barrel jars. At Phylakopi, some light on-dark figures are attested,6 which are rare at Akrotiri. No comparable evidence is available from Ayia Irini, as the respective strata are as yet missing from the settlement sequence. Of particular interest for the history of figuration in the Cyclades is the manufacture of zoomorphic vessels during this early period, attested for now only at Phylakopi. These are classified mainly as pouring vessels, in stylised forms of animals, such as quadrupeds and possibly snakes (ring vases) in dark on-light matt painted and dark-faced incised wares.7 Small clay zoomorphic figurines, also quadrupeds, are found at Akrotiri, possibly dated by associated pottery to the same phase.8 The next ceramic phases corresponding to the later part of the MC period at both sites, Phylakopi Phase C and Akrotiri Phases B-D,9 represent the establishment and florescence of naturalism in vase iconography. Figurative motifs are mainly attested in dark-on-light and bichrome (black and red) wares. Dark-on-light motifs apparently appear earlier in both sites, mainly depicting animals and a schematic motif dubbed the 'goblin' at Phylakopi.10 They then continue in greater numbers and variety along bichrome motifs, with some differences in the repertoire of the two sites. Bichrome ware is particularly attractive in aesthetic terms, in that the naturalism of the figurative motifs is enhanced by the use of colours, matt black and burnished red on a buff canvas, occasionally enriched by white added details. Moreover, the high quality of manufacture and the elegance of the vase forms contribute to the assigned value of the Cycladic bichrome vases, much appreciated in the southern Aegean as indicated by exports of such vases to Crete,11 Kea,12 and the Greek mainland13 and the survival of 'heirlooms' in later contexts.14 A shared repertoire of motifs between the two production centres includes pomegranates, birds, humans and felines, while bichrome griffins and crocuses appear mostly at Akrotiri (FIGS. 21.2, 21.3 a-d).15 Despite the prevalent naturalism, some conventions apply in the rendering and syntax of the motifs. For example, it is evident that the painter usually aims to depict pomegranate trees with stem, leaves and fruit, and not only the fruit, which, however, undoubtedly assumes a central position due to its disproportionate scale (fig. 21.2 b). Birds cannot be easily associated with a particular species and are rendered in a generic manner with some variations (fig. 21.2 a).16 The 3 From Phylakopi see examples in Atkinson et al. 1904, pi.

They are males, depicted with head and legs in profile, torso in frontal view, with rudimentarily rendered anatomical features, such as facial parts, hair and genitals (FIG. 21.3 a). Some form of cloth partially covers the lower torso, while the change of colour in the depiction of lower legs could occasionally suggest a type of boot, also evident in the pair of possibly human figurine legs in bichrome ware found at Akrotiri (FIG. 21.3 e). In terms of syntax arrangement on the vase surface, figurative motifs tend to occupy either a continuous zone around the belly of the vases, evident in the repetition of identical motifs in horizontal succession, or they are arranged in defined zones to produce a frontal and a rear reading of the vase surface. In the first case, the effect is mostly decorative, emphasising movement, such as in the case of a flock of birds in flight (FIG. 21.2 a). In the second case, the effect is either static and emblematic, as in the case of large crocuses (fig. 21.2 d), or narrative and engaging, as in the case of the libation scene (FIG. 21.3 a). The narrative element is not new in Cycladic iconography However, it is in this period that narrative scenes exert a significant impact to the viewer and user, analogous to that of wall paintings, a matter to which we shall return later. Three-dimensional figurative creations are rare in the late MC period. Figurines are only found sporadically, in clay or stone. A pair of possible human figurine lower leg fragments and a jug spout probably in the shape of a duck's head are found at Akrotiri, both in bichrome ware (FIG. 21.3 e-f). Another component of plastic creation can be traced in the anthropomorphic and zoomorphic features of some vase types, especially the beak-spouted nippled jugs and the side-spouted jugs, whose refined fashioning and painted or plastic details strongly evoke the features of women and birds. While iconographic creation is by no means only applied on such vases, it is worth emphasising that it is mainly encountered in both sites on pouring vessels, followed by drinking vessels (cups) and large containers (pithoi and transport jars). Much can be inferred about the function of these vases and their active role in social practices, combined with issues of portability and scale, matters to which we shall return below. MC FIGURATIVE REPRESENTATION IN THE SOUTHERN AEGEAN CONTEXT In order to argue further for the significance of this new form of accentuated iconicity which emerged in the Cyclades in the MBA, we need to consider some contextual aspects involving diachronic as well as contemporary perspectives. The Cycladic tradition in iconographical creation reaches back to the Neolithic period as expressed mainly by figurines,20 and new finds of rock-art compositions at Strofilas on Andros.21 It is certainly strong in the EC period, with marble figurines continuing the tradition of anthropomorphic plastic creation, in a more formalised way, while zoomorphic figurines are produced as models and small containers. Two dimensional figurative depictions are rare and appear on pottery, stone vases, rock-engravings and metal work.22 In the MC period there is apparently a lack of substantial evidence for three-dimensional figurative art, while the development of elaborate iconographical pottery at Phylakopi and Akrotiri represents a distinct figuration mode. It has been suggested that schematic human and animal figures on early MC pottery may signify the first attempt to transfer the formalised EC figurative plastic tradition on a flat surface,23 while later in the period naturalism takes over to accommodate a higher degree of detail imposed by the narrative perspective. It is possible that the emergence of vase types in the Cyclades strongly inferring human or animal attributes partly compensates to some extent for the lack of three-dimensional modelling. In the next period, LC I, figuration and narrative immediacy are certainly more vividly expressed by mural art and the large terracotta figures at Kea. Pottery continues to host vivid iconography, mainly nature scenes, but has lost the touch of immediate symbolism conveyed in the previous period, since the motifs and the narrative elements have been transferred to the more suitable for communicative purposes large-scale art of wall paintings. But then at this stage the process of Minoanisation has taken precedence over many of the community practices, so that all interpretative approaches should be filtered accordingly. From a contemporary point of view, the MBA figurative ceramic production of the two island centres remains unparalleled, both in terms of the iconographic vocabulary implemented as well as the particular modelling of vase forms. In the case of the appearance of certain motifs and their articulation on the ceramic surface, no finds from Kea or any other site in the Cyclades testify to such an extended and imaginative repertoire.

For example, both in Ayia Irini and Phylakopi pottery of dark fabric bears a whitish slip to create a suitable canvas for specific dark-on-light matt painted wares, a feature not attested until now in Naxian products.25 On the other hand, Cretan buff fabrics are dark slipped during the larger part of the MBA and follow a distinct ware and stylistic development obviously not shared by Cycladic production centres. It is plausible to suggest that selection of available materials in ceramic production and specifically surface treatment complies with socially imposed taste, such as the need to imitate metal or stone vases in clay counterparts in MBA Crete, which is obviously not the case or priority for potters and communities in the Cycladic islands during the same period. An important issue lies in the selection of imagery and its affiliations in the southern Aegean and beyond. It is not in the scope of this paper to present exhaustively the variations of motifs, which are indeed numerous especially in the case of plant themes and their schematic repertoire.26 Motifs inspired by nature are generally prevalent and occur in varied combinations. Lilies and crocuses appear on MC pottery on limited occasions, as also in contemporary Cretan pottery, but it is possible that they have not yet assumed the significant symbolic meaning they are assigned with in the LBA. Quadrupeds, apparently caprids, are found in different styles, in contrast to the bull, which only appears once on MC pottery,27 and is still rare on contemporary MM pottery. Pomegranates and griffins potentially signify the first true indications of exotica in the Cyclades, as their associations lie in the East. The pomegranate fruit was apparently known to the Akrotiri community, as charcoal from pomegranate trees has been identified in a late EC level at the site.28 Rare attempts to depict the seeds of the fruit on MC pottery may imply that symbolic meaning related to prosperity, explicitly documented in later periods, was already attributed.29 On the other hand, the symbolic meaning of griffins and the association of these creatures with gods and rulers in Egypt and other eastern cultures seems more straightforward. The iconographical type depicted on MC pottery is conventionally thought to copy Syrian prototypes.30 It is tempting to attribute symbolic qualities to the motif retrospectively, stretching the contextual evidence backwards from the LB wall paintings, seals and other forms of artistic expression in Crete and eastern Mediterranean in general. Of particular interest is the speculation on how this iconographical type travelled, since the small scale of the few MM II—III Cretan seals where the type is depicted cannot really account for such a high level of detail in MC ceramic depictions.31 Since it is unlikely that a foreigner travelled to the islands to depict the particular motif on locally produced pottery, and more significantly in the local styles and wares, it is plausible to suggest that this and possibly other motifs were copied diachronically in various art modes via the circulation of patterned textiles or other painted perishable materials.32 Finally, the human figure motif, although not a novelty in Aegean two-dimensional art, is still rare and occurs very sporadically in Cretan and Aeginetan pottery. Its significance in the MC ceramic depictions lies primarily in the notion of engagement and action, as is eloquently demonstrated in the narrative scenes of a limited number of vases. However, due to the lack of specific attributes, such as individual traits or associated objects, it seems that emphasis is more on the transmission of meaning of the narrative scenes, where generic humans act as agents, and not on the central role and status of certain individuals. It is only in LB fresco and glyptic in Crete and the Cyclades that the individual assumes an inherent symbolic role and attributes as priest/priestess or god/goddess. It is also interesting that no attempt is made to indicate age in MC human figures, a marked contrast to wall painting iconography, where age plays a central role to the formalised tasks performed by different individuals.33 The only possible attempt to signify age attributes in MC iconography comes from the other side of the libation jug, where the engagement of the large statuesque bird with its offspring has been recently interpreted by Christos Doumas as a reference to initiation rituals (FIG. 21.3 b).34 24 Cf.

Davis 1986; Doumas 2000. 34 Doumas 2005.</page><page sequence="7">MIDDLE CYCLADIC ICONOGRAPHY Along similar lines, it may be noted that apparently no females are depicted on MC pots. If indeed these scenes reflect social practices and beliefs of the MC co mmunities, we may note the remarkable change attested in LB iconography and the central role that the female assumes in such depictions. Since this change is inherently linked to Minoan beliefs and their diffusion, caution is definitely needed in the inference of religious beliefs and ritual practices of the MC communities. The other component in the MC ceramic production, which complements the uniqueness of the iconographical vocabulary in the contemporary southern Aegean, is the attribution of anthropomorphic or zoomorphic features to some classes of pouring vases. These formal properties, although not unknown in earlier periods,35 do appear to characterise the Cycladic production in the MBA and early LBA. While not directly comparable in terms of manufacture techniques and prototypes inferred, the skeuomorphs produced during the same period in Crete36 come into the picture when issues of function are addressed. MC anthropomorphic or zoomorphic jugs, in particular those with iconographical decoration, may compare in functional terms to MM skeuomorphs copying the form or elements of metal vases used in the same contexts as their prototypes, as paraphernalia for the perfor mance of rituals and/or conspicuous consumption in public feasting. This aspect introduces the discussion of the social context of the production and consumption of MC figurative vases. MC CERAMIC ICONOGRAPHY AND ITS SOCIAL CONTEXT There are various methodological approaches to the examination of iconography in general, each placing emphasis on particular attributes, such as typological comparatives and interplay, symbolic meaning, agency and contextual correlations.37 The scope of this paper certainly does not allow for a thorough synthetic interpretative approach and a combined consideration of all aspects. Rather, taking the evidence from Akrotiri as a case study, I then offer a brief discussion of the potential function of MC iconographical vases in their community contexts, focusing on their role as 'conduits' for the thoughts and acts of people and the qualities or 'affordances' of their materiality38 for social practices and the negotiation of social relations and interaction. At Akrotiri, the excavation of stratigraphical trenches over practically the full extent of the site has resulted in the exploration of rooms of distinct MC buildings, especially in the eastern part of the site. While not entirely on safe ground for the identification of distinct MC households, a comparative and contextual approach to figurative painted vases in distinct rooms may allow some consideration for their distribution, quantification and function. Preliminary observations suggest that dark-on-light and bichrome figurative vases are found in every unit excavated in varying percentages and repeated types, which include mainly jugs, large pithoi, a few amphorae and a few cups. In the same contexts, Cretan MM IIIA pottery has been found, with distribution and quantitative patterns which may suggest that some households were more active in the acquisition of such imports, possibly considered as elite or status indicators for their owners.39 However, the imported Cretan vases do not appear to substitute local production in terms of vase function and, by implication, in terms of utility or efficacy in everyday and/or ritual practices. The large variety and number of jugs found in MC and LC I households suggest that pouring must have been a practice deeply embedded in social activities at Akrotiri, with a central role in public and private ceremonies. This ritual aspect of pouring can be inferred by iconographic depictions of such ceremonies on MC pottery (the libation jug) and LC I wall paintings (the men's fresco from Xeste 3). The essential paraphernalia for domestic/communal ritual activity are apparently also vested with ritual significance. This implication is again supported by the field of imagery: certain types of jugs are elaborately decorated with motifs from the natural world, possibly associated with notions of fertility/prosperity, or the jugs themselves constitute the main painted motif (mainly beak-spouted and/or nippled jugs, very characteristic Theran products).40 While it is not easy to provide contextual support for all cases, especially for the fragmented evidence from MC households, suffice it to mention the ceramic assemblage from Xeste 3, a ceremonial locus par excellence, where jugs constitute the majority of all vases found in this LC I building.41 In addition, it is worth noting that rhyta only appear at Akrotiri in LC I levels, including the bull rhyton, which reproduces an iconographical type relatively rare in the field of imagery of this particular island community.42 Along these lines, and taking into account the evident continuity in cultural terms between the MC and the LC I community, one may plausibly suggest that some MC figurative vases, mainly of the pouring categories, assumed a centre-stage role in ceremonies 35 E.g. EC zoomorphic vases, above n. 7; for EM female vases/ figures see Warren 1973. 36 See Knappett 2002. 37 See for example papers in Laffineur and Crowley 1992; Darcque and Poursat 1983; Sherratt 2000. 38 On the concept of affordances see Knappett 2004. 39 Knappett and Nikolakopoulou 2008. 40 For Theran LC I vases with painted beak-spouted jugs see Marthari 1987, figs. 5b, 25. 41 Papagiannopoulou 1995. 42 Above n. 27.</page><page sequence="8">IRENE NIKOLAKOPOULOU performed at the household level. This is not to argue that all figurative vases must be explained away as ritual objects, but the case is strong enough in certain particular instances, corroborated by iconographic associations and/or contextual evidence. These include some jugs, especially when combined with relevant narrative or symbolic iconography, such as the libation jug, with depicted scenes related to pouring rituals and initiation ceremonies;43 the large pictorial bathtub — possibly an heirloom found in a LC I room together with other valued objects — with a hunting scene and emblematic figure-of-eight shields;44 and the griffin jar, found on the floor of a MC house together with a group of ribbed vases, a type unique to Akrotiri and vested with ritual significance.45 This functional role of the iconographic vases as elements of material culture actively participating in communal activities on the household level can be broadly compared to the role of the wall paintings in LC I, equally widely distributed in most of the domestic units of the settlement. Naturally, this appraisal calls for more elaboration as it introduces notions concerning the relative qualities of the host materials, the pots and the wall paintings. While not attempting to downplay the potential symbolic and/or didactic role of particular motifs or narrative scenes, a concerted interpretative approach should take into account matters of scale, portability, technological/manufacture competence and outreach/impact on the particular community and beyond. These are just a few of the factors, other than purely iconographical attributes, to be considered in relation to artefacts bearing some form of figuration, which falls outside the scope of this paper. As hinted at above, it has been acknowledged that the fairly sudden boom of figurative pottery at the onset of the MC period coincides with the emergence of nucleated island polities at Akrotiri and Phylakopi.46 The evidence so far points to a radical shift in settlement patterns from the model of dispersed EC units to prime island centres, with concomitant implications for social organisation and urban development. Intrinsically pervasive in everyday private and public life, the MC ceramic production of the two communities could have acted as a suitable vehicle for the promotion of group solidarity in intra-community terms within this newly established socio-political setting. Access to and consumption of evocative material culture elements, such as iconographical pottery, corroborates the argu ments for the lack of marked discrepancies in social milieu and the conscious reproduction of a shared distinct cultural and ideological identity in the MC and LC communities. The remarkable MC ceramic production of Akrotiri and Phylakopi, certainly easily identifiable in the prehistoric Aegean, must have operated as a conspicuous indicator of the distinct collective identity of the communities, possibly in the context of peer polities emerging and interacting in the southern Aegean and especially Old Palace Crete. This argument may be further sustained by the admittedly limited number of MC iconographical vases exported to southern Aegean sites. Their recognisability and assigned value is tentatively suggested by the meaningfully charged findspots/contexts for some of these vases. These include the jugs found in the Grave Circles at Mycenae and the Temple Repositories at Knossos and the griffin jar found in House A in Kea, probably an heirloom found in LC I context.47 To conclude, it is here argued that MC ceramic iconography must be considered in conjunction with its host materials, the pots, and their role in the establishment of intra-site social relations and inter site interaction. The points raised above set a promising agenda for future elaboration on aspects of interaction and agency between the human (producer and consumer) and the material component (iconographical vases) within a social space of rapidly changing dynamics. As for the Cyclades, one of the most important parameters in achieving conspicuous credentials in south Aegean networks was that local traditions and traits remained vivid and active in the respective LBA communities, thus counteracting the homogenising influence of Minoan power.
