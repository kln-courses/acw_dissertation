<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME DESCRIPTIVE PROPERTIES OF RELATIONS I. MUTUAL AID AMONG RELATIONS FOR the last four hundred years, since the time of Leonardo da Vinci and Galilei, we have been eagerly and rapidly learn- ing how to produce conditions favorable for observation with eyes and ears. We call it physical experiment. By means of skilfully arranged individual situations experimental sciences are able to read information concerning laws and forces which are of universal significance. It is time to realize that observation is not confined to those things which can be seen and touched. A mathematician who establishes a new proposition in the theory of numbers often does this by carefully observing the behavior of certain numbers. The fact that every integer can be represented as a sum of four squares had been observed long before Lagrange gave a general proof of it. Gauss originally discovered the law of reciprocity for quadratic residues by induction, and he testifies that the general proof long evaded his most strenuous efforts, causing him much distress. The history of mathematics is full of illustrations of this sort. A careful observation of abstract situations in mathematics not merely helps, but seems to be a necessary preliminary for a successful research. We propose to apply observation and description to the study of metaphysics. Before venturing to offer a general method for such a procedure we propose to approach descriptively some specific problem of general metaphysics, and try to show how much can be done in this specific field by suspending all philo- sophical theories as to the idealistic, realistic, pragmatic, or neutral character of the situations concerned, and confining ourselves exclusively to description. What is here meant by description will become clear in the process of work. We here propose to treat descriptively the problem of relation. Master and slave. The slave works for his master. He belongs to his master. He is eventually punished by him. Whatever he does as a slave (not as a man in general) he does with regard to his 34I</page><page sequence="2">342 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XL. master. Even if he revolts, it is against his master. In the slave's world, therefore, it is not he himself, the slave, but the master, who is primarily in view; who is the persistent object of fear, of devotion, of attention, of hatred, and what not. The situation of slavery from the slave's point of view lies in the master. If only he could get rid of his master, he would cease to be slave. The master is in an analogous position. He owns his slaves. He provides for them. He derives his living from them. He can even liberate them. But whatever he does as a master, he does with regard to his slaves. He is always confronted with his slaves, and not with himself. In his world slaves are the per- sistent objects toward which he at various times is obliged to take different attitudes. Socially, the master constitutes the power that binds and drives the slaves. Where is this power descriptively located? I do not mean-at least at this stage of the argument-, in whom is it vested; but where does it manifest itself, i.e. what are the empirically observable facts and events that reveal the power of the master? Let us observe the behavior of the master himself. That he has power is not an observable fact. But that he con- sumes the products of the slave's work may be observed and objectively described as a set of activities in his life. He eats what the slave has prepared for him, he trades the excess of his slave's work, he submits to be helped by the slaves. But in all these activities he reveals, not his own power, but that of his slaves, in so far as he merely receives what they do for him. Yet he also commands them. And it may seem that it is precisely in this capacity of commanding that his power is manifested. However, commanding, as a series of specific gestures, words, and actions, is not in itself a manifestation of power. For the same gestures may prove precisely a lack of power if they are not followed by the act of obedience on the part of the slave. Thus the behavior of the master never manifests the power vested in him. It is only through the act of obedience on the part of the slave that the master's power is revealed. And this act can be observed directly only in the behavior of the slave. It is in the character and organization of the slaves' work that the power of</page><page sequence="3">No. 4.1 PROPERTIES OF RELATIONS 343 their master is manifested. Hence what the word 'master' means is a power among slaves. On the other hand, what slavery means for the slave is an institution or an organized force that exists among masters. For, of course, slavery does not exist among slaves. For them it is an external force, an abominable machinery supported and financed by the state, which keeps them in subjugation. Thus what the word 'slave' means is a power or organization among masters. It is this descriptive situation, no doubt, that lies at the basis of Hegel's dialectical remarks concerning slavery. The dialec- tical phraseology presents the situation in a deliberately paradoxi- cal fashion by saying that master is slave-for he is a slave of his own slaves, an economically helpless creature that depends entirely on the work of others-, and slave is master, for similarly obvious reasons. Now this is misleading, and, at least descrip- tively, incorrect. For the master, even though he exists only as a power among slaves, is nevertheless fundamentally different from what they are. The germ of truth obviously contained in Hegel's dialectical discussion of slavery lies in the descriptive situation presented above. This situation does not warrant the assertion that the two terms involved in the relation are identical. Master is not slave. But in his world he is constantly confronted with slaves, and not with himself. Moreover, it is, I think, safe to assume that the average slave- owner had a very vague conception of the nature and limitations of his power. History supplies numerous illustrations of a highly deplorable ignorance on the part of the slave-owners (masters) with regard to what slave-ownership really means. The wealthy Roman landowner was scarcely conscious of the fact that pre- cisely in his capacity as master he was undermining the strength of the Empire, and was directly responsible for the ascent of the dangerous proletariat that finally wrought the ruin of Rome. He knew fairly well what slaves economically and otherwise meant for him. But he certainly was unaware what he meant for his slaves, for the rest of the society, or even for himself. Thus history corroborates our original assumption concerning the master's difficulties in defining his own nature. He does not face, and therefore does not easily 'see', himself. In his world he</page><page sequence="4">344 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XL. finds slaves in the foreground, and himself as a constantly present, yet but vaguely defined, background. His own image or concept is farther removed from his immediate practical view than that of his precious slaves. His own social, political, and logical physiognomy is obscured, and in a sense obstructed, by the im- mediate evidence of his counterpart. Thus in his own world he is found as facing his slaves and hiding himself. Right and left. Right runs against left. Moving to the right upon a straight line or a circle a point A encounters other points which are all in relative motion to the left with respect to A's direction. If we choose A as a zero point of orientation, then all points to the right of it have left orientation, and all points to the left have right orientation. We express this by saying that right faces left. It has its orientation in the left. Moreover, it lies to the left from the left. For by turning twice to the left we shall have on our left what was formerly on our right. In the logical self-determination of the right, therefore, left is the constant factor of reference. It will be well to recall that right is not identical with all the points, or objects, to the right from A. It is not a domain of points, but-figuratively speaking-a way of looking at those points from some definite position of an asymmetrical observer.' This 'way of looking' is not an intrinsic property of the points, nor does it exist among them.2 It cannot be found to the right 1 If we were symmetrically built, i.e. if we felt no distinction between right and left hand, and were supplied with a pair of eyes in the back, etc., we should not be able to distinguish between right and left as permanently fixed directions. This asymmetry constitutes one of the tacit assumptions of that branch of mathematics which studies the behavior of directed magnitudes, the theory of vectors. We read in Appell's TraitW de m&amp;anique rationelle: " Soit un axe D sur lequel on a choisi un sens positif, de z' vers z par exemple; un mobile M, d6crivant une courbe C dans l'espace, tourne autour de l'axe dans le sens positif quand un observateur, ayant les pieds en z' et la tete en z, voit le mobile tourner de sa gauche vers sa droit." Thus to be able to distinguish between right and left we must have, not merely two different hands, but also a head and a pair of legs. 2 This statement should not be misconstrued as implying an endorsement of Kant's transcendental idealism. One may not be idealistically inclined, and yet admit that orientation is not a property of the points. Eddington (Mathematical Theory of Relativity, p. g) writes, for instance: " If we describe the points of a plane figure by their rectangular coordinates x, y, the description of the figure is complete, and would enable any one to construct it; but it is also more than complete, because it specifies an arbitrary element, the orientation, which is irrelevant to the intrinsic properties of the figure."</page><page sequence="5">No. 4.1 PROPERTIES OF RELATIONS 345 from A. Where is it located? In the observer, to be sure. But this kind of 'in' is not a descriptive property of the relation in question. We wish to describe a geometrical property, whereas 'in the observer' is not a geometrical, but an epistemological, relation. Where is that 'look' located, not epistemologically, but descriptively, in terms of the situation here empirically given? Where does it come from in terms of geometrical orienta- tion along the line? It seems that only one answer is descrip- tively conceivable: the look comes from the left. And, indeed, the point of reference, A, which represents our observer upon the line, the point from which the look goes, is actually situated 'in' the left with respect to all the points located to the right of A. Thus the right direction may be properly described as a 'look from the left'. This is not a matter of subjective definition. What we have (figuratively) described as a look is an objective phenomenon, something that exists in nature, in Being, and not only in con- sciousness. If the relation be wholly depersonalized and every reference to an asymmetrical observer eliminated, the distinction between right and left will be reduced to a purely mathematical difference in sign-plus and minus, which are entirely relative and interchangeable, and yet irrevocably different. Perhaps it is better to call them (with Russell) "rays" instead of 'looks'. No less a person than Gauss points out that the difference be- tween right and left is in itself wholly determined, i.e. if in a plane definite directions be arbitrarily asigned to 'in front' and 'be- hind', and if with respect to the same plane the positions of 'up' and 'down' be chosen, the remaining two directions are uniquely determined.3 The distinction is objective, and cannot be wholly explained as an effect of our asymmetrical organization. For in order to build us asymmetrically nature itself must have em- ployed the two directions as distinct. If they had not been objectively distinct we could not possibly exist as asymmetrical creatures. This in brief is the essence of Kant's argument in favor of the objective character of the right-left relation. In his Von dem ersten Grunde des Unterschiedes der Gegenden im Raume he argues that nature itself makes the distinction permanent 3 Gauss, Theoria Residuorum Biquadraticorum (Werke, I, p. I77).</page><page sequence="6">346 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XL. by regularly arranging certain biological forms in a uniquely asymmetrical manner. And yet the two directions, however distinct, are determined only with reference to each other. In traffic we must keep to the right. But is it the right direction that we are primarily con- scious of as we travel? Do we watch the machines on our right? Certainly not primarily. We are aware of our righthand fellow- travellers only when we have to pass by one of them, and in doing so we must keep to the left. This is a very significant detail. As soon as we become aware of our own side in the traffic we are obliged to behave like those who are on the left. Moreover, as drivers we are very inadequately conscious of our own motion. It is the cars travelling in the opposite direction, i.e. the left- hand ones, that we have to watch, and the collision with which we are trying to avoid by keeping to the right. It is precisely the left direction that dominates our consciousness. The right is only a vaguely felt background. What is, clearly seen and watched for, and feared, is the left direction. Relation as operation. What can be derived from the above illustrations with regard to the nature of relation as such? First of all we may observe that each of the two terms involved in relation does something with respect to the other term, or to the outside world. Right runs against left, or faces left. As a direction it lies somewhere, namely, to the left, from the left, etc. Its substance is expressed by a verb, not by a noun. In this sense it is an operation, not an entity. It reveals itself, i.e. defines its own field or sphere, by doing something. The master owns his slaves. The slaves belong to their master. Right runs against left. Left lies to the right from the right. Just what each term actually does constitutes its genuine sphere as distinct from its logical, psychological, ethical, perhaps physical, spheres, which determine its nature as a logical, psychological, perhaps physical entity. With respect to the genuine sphere the philosophical distinctions of subjective and objective, mind and matter, reality and neutrality, are wholly irrelevant. Relation, therefore, is not a coexistence of two entities, but a cooperation of two genuine spheres. Of course, we do not deny that every relation is something. It may exist or subsist in many</page><page sequence="7">No. 4.] PROPERTIES OF RELATIONS 347 different spheres. It may be variously interpreted as a neutral entity, or a function of mind, as an idea or a mere word, as an instrument of action or a configuration of atoms in my head. Yet all this variety of philosophic interpretations does not affect the genuine output of the relation as operation, It will always do what it does regardless of whether it is philosophically con- sidered as a function of mind or a neutral entity, i.e. regardless of whether we choose the idealistic or the realistic position to explain its nature. But if such a radical change in philosophic interpretation does not affect the structure of relation, if it is possible for us to regard relation at one time as a neutral entity, and at another time as an instrument of action, or even as a mere symbol, -then there must be something in it that lies above and beyond any and all of these interpretative features; something that every relation does re- gardless of whether it is an entity or an activity, a configuration of atoms or a category. This something that is left behind when we suspend all philosophic theories concerning the essence of relation, this empirical residuum that enables us to understand what relation does independently from any metaphysical or epistemological interpretation, is what we have in mind when we speak of relation as operation. Relation described as facing a situation. The ideas expressed in the preceding paragraph may at once receive a concrete application. 'The master owns his slaves.' Owns-that is what the master does regardless of whether this owning is a function or a substance, a sensation or a neutral entity. Neither sensa- tions nor neutral entities own each other. The relation of owner- ship does not apply to logical terms. No matter what they are, they are not what the master is in his own genuine sphere. A term in logic means what it never means in its actual performance -a unit of denotation mysteriously tied to another unit by means of a medium vaguely called relation. Relation is there conceived as an entity which implies its terms (per modum inhaerentis). Descriptively, however, i.e. in its own genuine sphere, every relation does something definite and very specific (per modum ad aliud se habentis) beside implying or being implied. The master owns, the slaves belong, etc. Now let us consider the situation</page><page sequence="8">348 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VoL. XL. in its general aspect. For master substitute the symbol p, and for slave the symbol q. Then the word 'owns' must also be replaced with something else. We are accustomed to call this something relation. Our phrase becomes 'p is related to q'. What are p and q doing in this situation? The minimum of what is given to us distinctly in every rela- tional situation is a certain coordinated behavior of its terms, p and q. A thing that is larger than another behaves mathe- matically in a certain manner with respect to that which is smaller. A creature that has wings must satisfy the conditions necessary for the existence and functioning of wings. In other words, every relative term has to fit the frame provided for it by its relative companion. If relative terms could speak they would describe themselves primarily as facing certain situations defined, not in their own elements, but in the elements of their respective associates. We shall express this by saying that every relative term is a 'face' confronted with a 'field' in which it is operative. An important corollary to this is that no term is operative in its own field. Thus slave is the relative field of master; it is master who operates in this field, not slave. By exploring the field we become acquainted with the face (ex filio enim pater cognoscitur). Face. Face implies direction, not necessarily in a physical or geometrical sense, but in the sense of a definite course of operation, or progressive determination. Moreover, it uniquely defines a direction which for every possible observer remains always the same. For facing something implies a definite and intrinsically irreversible operation in the direction away from. . . This is what we call the specific deflection of logical energy in relation, as distinct from the imaginary deflection to be discussed later on. A cube has six faces. This means that by a geometrical operation perpendiculars can be erected from the cube in six different directions. A commodity has a face-value. This means that a definite amount of utility can be derived from it. Face is not originally a geometrical notion. It is a prerequisite of every geometry, because it generates directions within any given dimension. Neither direction, nor dimension, however, is an exclusively geometrical category. They are both applicable to various kinds of manifolds of non-geometrical as well as meta-</page><page sequence="9">No. 4-1 PROPERTIES OF RELATIONS 349 geometrical nature, such as color-schemes or space-time. The characteristic feature of a one-dimensional manifold, according to Riemann, is the property of duality, i.e. that from any point belonging to the manifold progression is possible in two directions, and in two only ("eine einfach ausgedehnte Mannigfaltigkeit, deren wesentliches Kennzeichen ist, dass in ihr von einem Punkte nur nach zwei Seiten, vorwirts oder rfickwarts, ein stetiger Fort- gang m6glich ist").4 This property originates in the situation of facing. It is profoundly significant that philologically the word 'face' is closely related to the verbs to do and to make. The Latin facies is commonly regarded as a derivative of facere: quando facies sit forma omnis et modus et factura quaedam corporis totius. The historical dependence, however, is probably reverse. Face is the original, primitive concept expressing and defining a certain characteristic situation, which, along with right and left, and up and down, permanently accompanies us in our journey through the world. The world, our world as an entity, is specifically colored by the fact that we are beings that have faces. For face is the fundamental category that determines our position (Ko^qa.&amp;) in the world (Heidegger's In-der-Welt-Sein).5 What- ever we do we must face. The world originates in work. For what we call things are largely complexes of endeavor, situations that we face in practical contact-in other words facts, frames of a prospective work, prolata. Face is the most fundamental, aboriginal direction in space, probably the origin of our empirical space as visually extended field, container of things. 'In front' is the pivot of our geometrical orientation. And the primitive 'in front' must have been practical rather than mathematical or geometrical. It meant what was first or primarily to be done, a field of work. Portuguesefaceira means cultivated acre, nearby a village. In Logudorian dialect acffakka means near-by. More- over, facing suggests a journey in proficiscor, which is related to facies through facio; it is a point of departure from which every- thing starts. If relation, therefore, is facing a situation, it must 4 Riemann, Ueber die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen, p. 4. Weyl's edition, igig. 5 M.

XL. be regarded primarily as prolation, a logical movement away from. ... In fact, the early Christian theologians, who under the term Trinity often discussed the logic of relations, coined the word prolatio, which corresponds to the initial stage in the process of relation by virtue of which one term (face, image, hypostasis) proceeds to generate its relative co-factor.6 Next to 'away from .' the current conception of face sug- gests revelation, in the sense that facing reveals facts genuinely relevant to the situation in question. This is not a vague analogy with more or less strong anthropomorphic implications. It is a descriptive property of every relation. By revelation we here do not mean 'consciousness of' or 'subjective discovery of' an object. In aRb a is not necessarily conscious of b. It may or may not be so, according to the nature of the relation. The master is conscious of his slaves. But the right is not conscious of the left, at least not in its own genuine function as a geometric direction. In aRb R does not mean that a discovers b. And yet it decidedly and genuinely means that a reveals b, in the sense that it denotes the bearing that the elements of b have upon the whole situation. If, in accordance with our previous suggestions, we imagine a as a sort of logical screen, or face, then what is performed upon that screen is, not a's own content, but b's relative properties. Philology may be cited again to clear up the intricate connexion between facing and revelation. Face, through Latin facere, facies, points to the Greek avElvv, to show, or 4alvecara, to appear, and soqls, which all have their source in Sanskrit bha, to shine, to flash. The latter is believed to be closely connected with sphay, to be distended (Old Persian bann, beam), which shows that all these words were originally expressions of orienta- tion. Reference. This extrinsic aspect of relation is retained in reference, which in popular usage still means a written statement of the qualifications of an emplovee given by the employer. This 6 Tertullianus, Apologeticus adversus gentes (Patrologiae Cursus Completus, I p. 457), "Hunc ex Deo prolatum dicimus, et prolatione generatum." Cf. Libri adversus Praxeam, I, p. i86: "protulit enim Deus Sermonem, . . . sicut radix fruticem, et fons fluvium, et sol radium."</page><page sequence="11">No. 4.1 PROPERTIES OF RELATIONS 351 popular usage, however, is in English by no means the original. The word was used by Chaucer in the sense of sending back. Modern English seems to omit 'back', reserving all the implica- tions of the return action for such words as response and relation. Reference retains only the esoteric signification of directing atten- tion to something or somebody else. In 'referring a matter to . . .' we, at least in some respect, shift the responsibility for it from ourselves to somebody else. In a sense, we send it away in some specific direction, and deliver it into some one else's hands. Thus reference is an incomplete relation. It changes faces by bringing the matter to the cognizance of another person or term. But this latter remains extraneous, and may fail to send it back; for the reference may be misleading or irrelevant. The reflex motion is here subjectively expected, but not objectively neces- sary. Reference is relation in the state of unrest. It tosses the matter from one term, or face, to another-and first to one, then (possibly) to another. It represents relation in the state of unstable equilibrium, which means that it misrepresents it. In which direction is relation misrepresented by reference? The logical material constituting both is practically the same. Both are derived from re, particle of iteration or intensification, and fero, tuli, latus. But the manner of synthesis in 'reference' is much simpler than that in 'relation'. There are two separate and temporally different operations in 'reference': a certain matter is first sent away, and then brought back again. This is altogether too simple to account for the mechanism of relation, where similar operations are performed simultaneously, and in a peculiarly penetrating manner which makes it difficult to set them apart. Moreover, the terms in reference differ from those in relation in that they are external to, and independent of each other. When I refer to a certain page in Darwin's Origin of Species I cannot possibly imply that that page means nothing apart from what I say about it, or that it was written with the view of supporting my remarks. But master actually means nothing without slave, nor slave without master. The latter two aid each other in a more intimate and more intricate fashion. The terms in reference also aid each other, but chiefly through the medium of an external factor-myself, consciousness, or a</page><page sequence="12">352 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XL. book, a passage, etc. It is not the term itself that performs the operation of reference, but somebody, or something, else. In a word, reference is relation simplified. And unfortunately this simplified edition is often misrepresented as the original one. Relevancy. Reference has more than the subjective significance of a source of knowledge, or means of obtaining information from something or somebody else. When I refer to a certain page in a certain book, I can do that only because the information is thus obtainable. That is, subjective information obtained from a reference must be based upon objective relevancy of the refer- endum. The reflex movement expected from a reference depends upon the nature and character of the thing to which I refer, and is granted to me only because the thing is objectively capable of producing the results expected. Reference is not merely sending away-this would be identical with dismissing the matter -but sending away in a specific direction. Specifying the direc- tion of the attention is an essential element of the meaning of the word. And this can be done only in so far as that specific direc- tion is relevant to the situation. This supplies another salient point for describing the behavior of terms in relation. Each of the two terms, for its meaning and subsistence, refers to the other; and in order that such reference should have any effect at all, each must be so constituted as to be able to supply something to the other. In other words there exists mutual aid among the terms in relation. Correspondence. It will be convenient at this point to recapitu- late the results thus far reached. We have described relation as 'facing a situation'. It lies in the nature and meaning of the word 'face' that a source of operation is thereby defined in the direction 'away from. . .'. This specific directedness and esoteric nature is retained in English in the word 'reference'. The logical energy that runs through relation has no beginning- and here lies the greatest difficulty in describing it. But in reference there is a definite starting-point, an in itself well-defined initial situation, from which a matter is being sent away, and to which it is expected to return enriched by communication. The circulation of logical energy is here at certain points arrested, and we are allowed to examine it while it is, so to speak, at rest.</page><page sequence="13">No. 4.1 PROPERTIES OF RELATIONS 353 It is like taking a series of instantaneous photographic snaps of the continuous and uninterrupted race in which relation has its existence. But it is precisely for this reason-because it kills the Heraclitic inconsistency of relation-that reference mis- represents it. Yet we have seen that reference contains certain features in common with relation. The terms in reference, though independent, cannot be entirely irrelevant to each other. And here we saw the origin of the mutual aid that exists among the terms in relation. We are now confronted with the difficult problem of describing the manner in which the terms necessitate, or sponsor, each other's meaning. When, in the process of an argument, you refer me to a certain page in a certain book, I expect that the information thereby obtained will elucidate something in the issue at hand. I expect it to fit in, to respond to, a definite need in demonstration, to fill in some hole in the argument. In other words there is something in our argument that corresponds to the reference. Of course, this something is not a mere absence of the information desired or expected. Argument is not a box where references could be geometrically deposited. There must be something in it with affirmative qualifications to accommodate the information ex- pected. In this particular case this something is furnished by a definite question which is answered by the reference. But the terms in relation do not ask questions, and do not wait for an answer. The specific necessity that binds relation does not coincide with that which unites question and answer together. Yet the analogy is not entirely meaningless. For each term in relation has a logically determinable output only because it fits into the field prepared for it by its relational opponent. Relation is a cooperation of two factors in fitting or organizing one situation (unum regnum). Language expresses this by the word corre- spondence, which may be properly translated as cooperation in fitting a given situation. The terms in correspondence appear as sponsoring a certain cause, or working together in the name of a common purpose (uvP5n7,uovpyo0. Mathematically, correspondence is a method, or rule, by which, if one series is given, the other may be generated by reference to it. Two series s and s' are said to be in correspondence when</page><page sequence="14">354 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XL. there is a one-one relation coupling every term of s with a term of s', and vice versa-' Functions with their dependent and inde- pendent variables are the simplest logical instances of series coordinated by correspondence. In the expression y = f(x) both x and y are, not single quantities, but series of values in one-one correspondence to each other. If the form of function is known, then to every value of y corresponds a unique set of values of x. If we confine our observations to integers only, the function y = x2 may be expressed by the one-one corre- spondence of the following two series: II, 2. I.3, 4- 4, 4 5,* I, 4, 9. i6, 25,. According to the rule expressed by this quadratic function, to every value of y correspond two unique values of x. In a geo- metrical continuum where the values of x are not confined to integers, this function may be taken as describing the coordinated behavior of abscissas and ordinates which results in a parabola. Terms in relation also stand for series. They are subject to description and definition. And both descriptions and definitions run in series. The slave works . . . belongs . . . revolts . . . obeys . . . etc. The totality of these predicates would express fully what the slave is. But we do not know the totality of his predicates. We only know a small part of them. Hence our series is incomplete. We can represent it by s = a, b, c, . . . Ix, yz .. But-and this is important-our information is not haphazard. We can indefinitely continue our research (historical, economical, ethical, statistical, theological, etc.) concerning slavery, and we have a good deal of genuine guidance from the information already at hand, that is, from a, b, c, . . . , etc., and also from the laws and rules governing the whole series. At least some of the x, y, zx can be deduced from the nature of the series, i.e. they may be generated according to a prescribed rule. One way of obtaining information concerning the unknowns is by considering that they are functions of s', i.e. that they must correspond to the members of the associated series expressing the nature of the master. 7 Russell, Principles of Mathematics, p. 26I.</page><page sequence="15">No. 4.1 PROPERTIES OF RELATIONS 355 Moreover, it is possible to describe the method by which one series can be obtained from the other. Just as the mathematical formula y = x2 gives me a rule for transforming the series of x's into that of y's, similarly relation furnishes a simple principle for constructing logical series. There is a dependence or necessi- tation of one series by the other. But this necessitation possesses no mystical powers. There is no mysterious force that compels a relative term to take a certain shape because its companion so wishes. There is no causal dependence between the two (nihil, quod productions in esse venerit). A term does not compel the other term to exist. What happens is something remarkably simple. To every element, property, or activity, x, of a relative term s, corresponds an element, property, or activity, y = -x, in the relative field of s. All the properties of the relative field of s have a negative sign with respect to s's own properties. There is just as much negation in the field as there is affirmation in the face, and vice versa. This does not mean that either of them is originally negative; but they fit each other within the relational situation only because, and only in so far as, they operate nega- tively with respect to each other. That the slave belongs (x) to his master means that the latter owns (-x) him. That he obeys his master means that the latter commands him to do something. It may seem that mutually negative entities cannot be said to be in correspondence with each other. Correspondence presupposes harmony, and cannot be found where hostility and discord prevail. Yet nothing, according to Sainte-Beuve, re- sembles a hollow so much as a swelling. Nothing fits more pre- cisely than the concave and convex side of the same surface. One cannot be drawn without the other. Convexity is a negative copy of concavity,8 yet so that neither is capable of separate existence. When one of them is mathematically formulated as a distinct function, the other is implicitly formulated with it. They constitute separate functions only because in analytical geo- metry right and left and plus and minus are arbitrarily assigned to 8 It is easy to see mathematically that a concave surface can be geometrically transformed into a convex one by changing the system of coordinates to the reverse position of the axes, i.e. by assigning negative values to xyz wherever they originally had positive ones.</page><page sequence="16">356 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XL. opposite directions. In other words, their separation is relative, -relative to two frames of reference constituted by two opposite systems of Cartesian coordinates. But these frames of orienta- tion are really irrelevant to the description of the intrinsic proper- ties of the surface involved, which is one. The surface can be adequately described by the intrinsic equations of differential geometry without reference to any Cartesian frame whatsoever, i.e. by stating the distances between the various pairs of points in it. We can now generalize this situation. Concave-convex surface is a good model of relation. But it is not the relation as such. In which way, or ways, does this model represent the behavior of terms in relation? First, we observe that the descriptive properties of a face in relation, which constitute a series, corre- spond to the descriptive properties of its relative field in pre- cisely the same way in which the points of a concave surface correspond to those of the convex. They are in one-one cor- respondence because they are the same points taken relatively to two different frames of reference. In our model we see how and why they are the same, and not the same,-a situation that so profoundly puzzled Hegel and his followers. Just as points on a curved surface appear as concave or convex, each relatively to its respective system of coordinates, similarly the descriptive properties of the relation of slavery-or any other relation for that matter-appear as master with respect the slave's frame of reference, or as slave with respect to the master's. They fit each other very precisely because they are negative doubles of each other. Secondly, we observe that facing its own relative field the term becomes logically absorbed by it. In the slave's world it is the master who is primarily in view. In a's field it is b which is manifested. From our model we see how it is done. By facing a surface from the concave side you must assume the position of a reference-frame reverse to that in which the surface behaves as concave. This is a somewhat awkward expression of our daily experience. In facing things we see only those surfaces which face us, or 'look at us' in opposite directions. It is more than our daily experience. We cannot get rid of it even in our</page><page sequence="17">No. 4.1 PROPERTIES OF RELA TIONS 357 dreams. It is a feature characteristic of any experience. For experience is relation. Our conception of the world is profoundly modified by this specific relativity. Nature, world, God, as 'outside' immensities in which there seems to be no reasonable room for our humble consciousness, are descriptive results of this common experience of facing. Experience, i.e. 'we', is lost in what is experienced. This misfortune we share with every term in relation. Each term is a face, i.e. a screen upon which the logical drama of its relative companion is played. The more perfectly the drama is presented, the less visible is the screen. The term must recede, or, figuratively speaking, forget and lose itself, in order to find its relative companion (dein Verlieren ist dein Fund). But as the drama of the term unfolds itself all its participants begin to realize that they are moved by a force which controls and binds every limb of their logical organism. Sooner or later they are bound to come to the conclusion that they are mere marionettes pulled by the strings of their all-powerful companion. They are manifestations of its logical energy. Thus they are obliged to return to the source of that from which they had never been separated (rediturus eo, unde separatus non fuerat). The negative character of the field, however, with respect to the face is not completely revealed by reference to negation. It is true that the field of A is non-A. But it is not merely that. Non-A here is not a formal privation, but acquires an affirmative character from the universe of discourse. It is not an empty form for the other term to fit in, but a logically active force, or more precisely, another operation. Hence every relative term is an operation upon operation, and not an entity somehow connected with another entity. The model that is commonly used to describe relation-two points connected by a line, or two letters with a third between, such as aRb-is misleading and actually incorrect. For what we descriptively find in relation is two parallel, yet reverse, operations, not entities connected by means of a mysterious, indefinable link. We shall presently see that the link does not exist. HENRY LANZ STANFORD UNIVERSITY (To be concluded)</page></plain_text>
