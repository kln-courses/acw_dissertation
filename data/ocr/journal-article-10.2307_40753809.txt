<plain_text><page sequence="1">HELMUT REHDER Studies in Goethe's Poetic Imagery, I goethe's poetic imagery is determined by the significance of the specific setting in which the particular poem, the particular narrative or dramatic situation is conceived or into which it is projected. Such settings are lyrical in structure, for they reflect a cosmic experience, an experience proceeding, as it were, from the center rather than the pe- riphery; and their significance is symbolic, for they stand for a content that defies identification and points toward the abstract and universal. Often enough these significant settings involve images of nature. This need not be interpreted as a token of eighteenth-century sentimentalism. In all ages of human consciousness Nature has been the realm of artistic imitation - "mimesis" - even to the point of most delicate abstraction. As we conceive of nature as the only element of that which is truly alive and capable of growth and reproduction, we conceive of the arts and the sciences as the age-old human attempts at duplicating life on the level of intuition and abstraction. It has often been observed that Goethe was not a good playwright. But he redeemed himself by giving his plays, through lyrical imagery, the coherence they lacked in dramatic structure and plan. This lyrical, imaginative element is ever-present and ever-constructive in his work, and as he passed through changing phases of outlook and style it re- mained the generative substratum of his poetic metamorphosis. Its principle is synopsis and synthesis; its manifestation the portrayal of the individual human situation, the single significant scene, the unique meaningful image. This projection of situation, scene, or image - rather than of idea, preconceived plan, or rational organization - forms something like a basic structural pattern of Goethe's mode of composition. Sometimes, in the casting of a momentous human situation into a particular setting (for example, a setting involving a minimum of illumination and, ac- cordingly, a greater share of the imagination ) , it merely serves the pur- pose of creating a "poetic atmosphere." Sometimes, however, the dy- namics of poetic signalization reveals a state of intense personal concern for fundamental problems of human existence, a concern that tran- scends purely aesthetic intent. Poetically, it makes little difference whether the "image" of the human situation is actually "seen," as in</page><page sequence="2">I56 HELMUT REHDER certain stage settings, or whether it is merely invoked by imagination through a highly elastic metaphorical use of language. Both media call for mutual complementation; sense and thought, reality and symbol, become so thoroughly merged that it is difficult to determine where the one ends and the other begins. I The Symbolism of the Cave The image of the cave is one of the most persistent images in Goethe's poetic production. Whenever it appears it adumbrates a welter of as- sociations too complex for exhaustive interpretation. To the literary his- torian the traditional nature of this image is beyond question. Platonic, biblical, literary, and folkloristic antecedents cannot be ignored. Still Goethe's use of the image suggests that he adopted and cultivated it as if it were one of his very own discoveries. Whether an ornamental device or an expression of his aesthetic, psychological, or religious convictions, it appears intrinsically linked with his primary and motivating poetic vision. A genuine symbol, it often stands for last and incommunicable contents of faith. One of the most mystifying scenes in Faust - and one causing Goethe considerable difficulties in composition and arrangement - is the scene "Wald und Höhle." Regarding its genesis and function, the scene has been puzzling to many Faust interpreters, partly because it appears quite abruptly and with little previous motivation in the middle of the Gretchen tragedy, partly because it combines seemingly contradictory stylistic principles as the result of several compositional alterations. In particular it is the identity of the "Erhabener Geist" to whom Faust is here shown addressing a prayer of thanks that has been the object of repeated inquiries. Structurally the scene is not without parallel in the Faust poem. A similar pattern of composition is found in the scenes "Anmutige Ge- gend" and "Hochgebirg" of Part II, where Faust is likewise engaged in a soliloquy, surrounded by a remote, deserted, and indeed fantastic nat- ural scenery, furnishing an appropriately "sublime" background for his communing with nature and himself. The landscape bears the features of primordial, archetypal scenery. In "Anmutige Gegend" the soliloquy is terminated by the "Flammenübermass" of sunrise, reminiscent of the "Flammenbildung" attending the apparition of the Erdgeist. In "Hoch- gebirg" it is terminated by the appearance of Mephistopheles who, as in "Wald und Höhle," eventually effectuates Faust's return to human society. It may be suspected that in "Anmutige Gegend," too, on the</page><page sequence="3">Studies in Goethe's Poetic Imagery, I 157 basis of the immediately following events, the emergence of Mephis- topheles may have been planned originally though later suppressed. The repeated employment of the same structural pattern in the two later scenes may be derived from the poetic effectiveness of "Wald und Höhle" in the first place. Poetically this scene is one of the most effective and stirring of the entire Faust play, not only because Faust's mood of sublime contemplation is eventually obliterated by the lecherous coaxing of Mephistopheles, but because within Faust himself the state of stoic detachment only feebly conceals his fundamental restlessness, his inner involvement and smouldering passion. The mainspring of this scene does not lie in the dramatization of Faust's failure or the Devil's triumph; we know that in the Urfaust this effect had been quite adequately assigned to another scene. Rather its fascinating effect lies in the haunting image of the cave itself, which possesses at least a twofold significance : that of a physical shelter and symbol of security - and that of the abode of mysterious apparitions - "die Reihe der Lebendigen" and the elemental spirits with whom Faust, in utter solitude, seeks the bond of fraternal kinship. The second meaning is significant. For it makes the image of the cave an emblem of the continuity of life and the persistence of the past which lifts that which once existed onto the level of a timeless pres- ent in the realm of Nature. Similar considerations will later contribute to the configuration of the "Mothers." Faust's soliloquy therefore is not necessarily indicative of regained stability and objectivity in matters of natural phenomena. Rather it indicates a point at which natural science and metaphysics, experience and intuition, are inseparably interwoven and mutually confounding. Faust's prevailing emotional attitude is one of "Schauer," a condition of shuddering awe, related to the perception of the numinous, and this sentiment suffices for Mephistopheles to ex- press decided disapproval of Faust's interest in the cave. Contrary to an expected association of the Devil with subterranean regions, Mephis- topheles dismisses Faust's sentiments as "Kribskrabs der Imagination" and for the remainder of the play, with few significant exceptions, re- mains free from any association with this image. On the other hand, the connection with the notion of the cave seems more justified in the case of the Erdgeist, although the details of his dramatic appearance con- tained no reference to the cave image. It has been common practice to interpret the "erhabener Geist" of "Wald und Höhle" in terms of the Erdgeist apparition of the first scene. Such an interpretation, however, does not succeed in explaining the difference in the levels of hedonic experience that exists between lines 514 ff and 3217 ff or lines 36 ff of the scene "Trüber Tag." The Earth Spirit from whom Faust sought desperately to extort the secret of crea-</page><page sequence="4">I58 HELMUT REHDER tion was a monstrous apparition which in no uncertain terms rejected any notion of affinity with the mind of man. Nor has it ever been associ- ated with the agency that assigned Mephisto to Faust as a constant companion. These discrepancies are well known. At this point the symbolism of the cave - as an image taking prece- dence over logical relationships - offers the possibility of solution. As symbolism it possessed a foundation in Goethe's mode of experience. During his early years in Weimar, Goethe often roamed through the duchy from one end to the other, examining the natural resources and considering, in the light of scientific evidence, the resumption of opera- tion of abandoned mines. On a background such as this it is perhaps significant when Goethe reported to Herder : "Seit drei Wochen wohnen wir auf dem Thüringer Wald, und ich führe mein Leben in Klüfften, Höhlen, Wäldern, in Teichen, unter Wasserfällen, bey den Unterirdi- schen, und weide mich aus in Gottes Welt" (August 9, 1776). Super- imposed upon the turmoil of his infatuation with Charlotte von Stein, an experience so all-absorbing that, in challenging the security of his self, it threatened the roots of his existence, this preoccupation with caves assumes a singular significance. In this connection we read of a visit to the Hermannstein Cave near Ilmenau, which seems to have furnished the archetype of the scene "Forest and Cavern." On August 8, 1776, Goethe wrote to Charlotte : "Heut will ich auf den Hermanstein, und womöglich die Höhle zeichnen hab auch Meisel und Hammer die In- schrifft zu machen die sehr mystisch werden wird. . . . Wenn ich so dencke, dass Sie mit in meiner Höhle war, dass ich ihre Hand hielt indess sie sich bückte und ein Zeichen in den Staub schrieb ! ! ! Es ist wie in der Geisterwelt, ist mir auch wie in der Geisterwelt. Ein Gefühl ohne Gefühl. Lieber Engel . . ." With only slight variations applying, we might recog- nize in Charlotte von Stein the prototype of the "Spirit Sublime" : Dann führst du mich zur sichern Höhle, zeigst mich dann mir selbst, und meiner eignen Brust geheime tiefe Wunder öffnen sich. Although the scene "Wald und Höhle" was not written until ten years later, when Goethe was in Rome and the relationship to Frau von Stein was receding into mellow memories, the recollection of the emo- tional crisis was still alive. For on October 27, 1786, a few days before Goethe reached Rome, he stopped at Terni and wrote in his diary the following lines addressed to Charlotte (and not included in the account of the Italian journey) : "Wieder in einer Höhle sitzend, die vor einem Jahre vom Erdbeben gelitten, wend ich mein Gebet zu dir mein lieber Schutzgeist." For now it becomes evident that the Spirit Sublime whom</page><page sequence="5">Studies in Goethe's Poetic Imagery, I 159 Faust is addressing in solemn prayer need not be the frightening vision of the Erdgeist at all but that it suggests the concept of a personal "genius" and tutelary spirit so appropriately connected with the symbol of the cave in the first place. The introduction of a personal, tutelary deity represents an element scarcely foreign to the spirit of the Faust legend and its intimate associa- tions with Renaissance demonology. Other configurations point in the same direction. One such concept is that of the Fountain of Youth, which is directly linked to the image of the cave the first time this image makes its appearance in the Faust poem, envisaged in the silvery light of the moon: Ach, könnt ich doch auf Bergeshöhn in deinem lieben Lichte gehn, um Bergeshöhle mit Geistern schweben, auf Wiesen in deinem Dämmer weben, von allem Wissensqualm entladen, in deinem Tau gesund mich baden! The Renaissance symbol of a Fountain of Youth, introducing the idea of physical rejuvenation along with a spiritual recovery of the "source of life," is predicated upon the desire to transcend the limitations of time, a mystical concept, brought close to Goethe through the early experience of Pietism. But it is more than pietistic hankering after self-fulfillment when the individual, separated from other human beings by the desperate desire to be "himself," seeks his self-realization through participation in the idea of a higher continuity - "Fortdauer" - of human existence. Goethe's early works express this concern in a peculiarly paradoxical alternation of dejection and elation wherever the thought of past and future, forebears and progeny, is touched upon. "Vorwelt" is viewed with a feeling of melancholy awe, "Nachkommenschaft" with one of skepticism. Faust cannot enter Gretchen's room, her "hut," that epi- tome of human care, neatness, and order, without being reminded of the "Vorwelt" which is the source of it. And in "Wald und Höhle" he is deeply affected when, in the light of the moon, he believes he sees "der Vorwelt silberne Gestalten" which to him are a token of secure anchorage. On the other hand, Götz von Berlichingen's ideal of free- dom is wasted on posterity in the moment in which the decadent weak- ness of his own progeny becomes apparent; and Egmont dies, childless and without succession and only with a feeble hope that his death may be exemplary for future generations. Separated from his origins, man will have lived in vain. Translate this temporal perspective into a spatial</page><page sequence="6">1 6o HELMUT REHDER symbol, and Goethe's pessimism is reflected in the image of the "Kerker," the very picture of finality, termination, and death; whereas his unconditional faith in survival, continuity, and rebirth attaches itself to the mysterious image of a subterranean cavern leading into the bowels of the Earth. Not without significance do the three major plays of the youthful Goethe conclude with a scene in a dungeon; man may not expect freedom until death. Should he conceive of himself without reference to a higher form of continuity and attempt to live a life with- out transcendence - as Adelheid does in the Götz play - then the powers of justice quickly convene to condemn him, as the seven judges do in the subterranean court of the secret "Vehme," or the powers of judg- ment in the ballad "Der untreue Knabe." There is no need to trace the ramified reflections on immortality which connect Goethe's metaphysical creed with the manifold varia- tions of his poetic imagery. As his views postulate that man, in order to be a self, comprehend his own origins and transcend his limitations by acknowledging them, time and again his lyrical imagery appears to coalesce into some form, some variation or modification of the cave metaphor. The lyrical temper of Die Leiden des jungen Werthers is particularly inclined towards such combinatory tendencies. As Werther prepares for his separation from Lotte, again the lovers meet in the light of the rising moon, in a grottolike arbor "das alle Schauer der Einsam- keit umschweben." Again their minds turn to thoughts of the departed, of immortality and continuity, and they separate with the assurance, "Wir werden uns wiedersehen" - the same words that ring through the concluding scene of Faust I and echo, with variations, in the second act of Lila and the fourth of Egmont. Even in his lyrics, where Goethe undertakes to verbalize the incommunicable secrecy of the self, the familiar image becomes manifest as an intimation of the act of tran- scending, Was, von Menschen nicht gewusst oder nicht bedacht, durch das Labyrinth der Brust wandelt in der Nacht. No genuine search of man's existential origins can be satisfied with the objectivity of a metaphor. The self is more than the concept or image man likes to make of it. Extraneous associations intrude and ceremonial- ize the intimate. During his early years in Weimar, Goethe was fond of relating his scientific pursuits to the company of the "Inferi," "die Un- terirdischen," and the incognito of his journey to Rome he was apt to allude to as his "unterirdische Reise." A similar formalization occurred</page><page sequence="7">Studies in Goethe's Poetic Imagery, I 1 6 1 where Goethe encountered another conception of subterranean mystery, a conception that was based on a literary as well as a religious tradition and, fused with the image of the cave, lent the latter the appearance of a definite poetic and psychological pattern. In many religions and mythologies the motif of palingenesis is closely linked with that of a descent into hell. To Goethe the latter was a poetic motif well known since his early youth. One of his first poems told of "Christ's Harrowing of Hell." Enthralled with the grandeur of the theme, he applied to the writing all the rhapsodic enthusiasm of which his youthful rhetoric was capable. The same enthusiasm, though con- siderably tempered by human and artistic wisdom, was still alive in the aged poet when he conceived his plan to have Faust descend into Tar- tarus to plead for the release of Helena. The scene was never written; where even an Orpheus had failed, no ordinary human words could be expected to reverse the laws of death. The theme was an attractive ex- periment at poetic expressiveness : hoping to wrest tearful compassion from the judges of the nether world was assuming more than what the defiant young author of "Schwager Kronos" had dared to do when he proposed to break into the world of the shades in order to exact respect from the plenipotentiaries of hell - Dass der Orkus vernehme: ein Fürst kommt, drunten von ihren Sitzen sich die Gewaltigen lüften. Clearly the invasion of the underworld was a traditional motif which challenged Goethe's poetic imagination. But we feel that this literary topos did not possess the engaging substance and force which is con- tained in "Wald und Höhle," that image of aboriginal wilderness and productivity. Similarly sophisticated, and even cynical, was the concept of Hades as it was suggested by Lucian's dialogues of the dead, freely imitated by Fassmann's Gespräche im Reiche der Toten (1718 ff), which employed the medium of the past in order to satirize the short- comings of the present. As Wieland had made use of this literary conceit, he found himself made the target of similar mockery in Goethe's Stygian farce Götter, Helden und Wieland, Several of the dramolets and op- erettas which Goethe wrote for the court at Weimar appear to have crystallized around the core image of Hades to which the leading char- acters find themselves transported in some weird vision. In each case an element of spuriousness interferes with the poetic effect: in Lila the heroine is cured of her despondency when, with the help of a Faust-like "Magus," she is able to release the souls of her kin from the cave to which the evil demon Oger has confined them; in Scherz, List und</page><page sequence="8">1 62 HELMUT REHDER Rache the effectiveness of the play depends on the skill with which the heroine enacts the pantomime of her imaginary death, her descent into the nether world, her crossing of the River Styx; and in the Triumph der Empfindsamkeit, the most incongruous mixture of levity and som- breness that Goethe ever wrote, the climax is reached in the monodrama "Proserpina" when the immortal goddess, through the eating of the fatal seeds, is irreparably delivered to the world of the shades and of death, to the monotonous duration of mere time. All of these dramatic attempts share the same shortcoming. In each case, a serious theme (significantly connected with the cave image) was wasted on incidental melodrama; the situation was artificial and dependent on pantomime rather than poetic expression ; and the sym- bolism was not anchored in the substance and spirit of what Goethe really had to say. With much more striking effect it asserted itself when it was employed in a play dealing with the very foundations of humanity and the unimaginable horror that will ensue once these foundations are abandoned. Iphigenie auf Tauris was such a play. A variation of a favorite con- cept of eighteenth-century cultural philosophy, it represented the trans- formation of man from a physical to a moral being, the transition from savagery to civilization. Like Faust, it suggested the cultural "Urphän- omen" of the crystallization of spiritual order and clarity out of a context of confusion and wilderness, symbolized in the image of the sanctuary and that of the cave. Only Orestes is tormented by the vision of hell. If ever any man has been cut off from the past, it is he who has separated himself from the continuous line of ancestors by the guilt of matricide - and the demons of retribution know neither pity nor delay : Sie horchen auf, es schaut ihr hohler Blick mit der Begier des Adlers um sich her. Sie rühren sich in ihren schwarzen Höhlen, und aus den Winkeln schleichen ihre Gefährten, der Zweifel und die Reue, leis herbei. Vor ihnen steigt ein Dampf vom Acheron; in seinen Wolkenkreisen wälzet sich die ewige Betrachtung des Geschehnen verwirrend um des Schuld' gen Haupt umher. Orestes is no mere fugitive on earth - Goethe's favorite image of pre- Weimar days. He faces the alternative to existence - nothingness, chaos, "das Nichts." Childless and alone, he is ready to accept his fate. The solution of his case offers the familiar paradox of transcending. He is cured from his obsession and won back to an acceptance of life, reality, and existence through a miracle of love, which transcends the personal,</page><page sequence="9">Studies in Goethe's Poetic Imagery, I 1 63 sexual relationship and rises to the level of the universal. In the moment in which Orestes becomes susceptible to this higher, humane love, he sees Tartarus open up to the vision of a peaceful procession of his an- cestors and himself genially received in their midst. In this moment, in which the self is shown transcending its own limitations, . . . löset sich der Fluch, mir sagt's das Herz. Die Eumeniden ziehn, ich höre sie, zum Tartarus und schlagen hinter sich die ehrnen Tore fernab donnernd zu. Goethe revised and completed Iphigenie auf Tauris in Italy when the composition of the scene "Forest and Cavern" was very much on his mind. The vision of Tartarus and the scene from Faust are counter- parts, two panels, as it were, representing the same theme in reversed order and complementing one another in poetic conception. There are familiar echoes suggested by the lofty strains of iambic pentameter, newly emerging in both works : Orestes finds himself in the moment in which he imagines affectionate recognition and welcome by his kin; and Faust begins to know his "brothers in air and water and the silent woods" in the moment he is absorbed in self-reflection. But there are also fundamental contrasts: while under the gentle pleadings of Iphi- genie the raging of Orestes' primitive passion gradually gives way to comforting clarity of mind, Faust is gradually driven back to the wilder- ness of turbulent desires by Mephisto's insinuations of unconcealed libido for which the cave metaphor furnishes an uncanny background. Still in another respect the scene from Iphigenie reveals a close affinity to the Faust matrix when the very image of the cave, in which the furies are lurking, turns out to be an early configuration of the realm of the Mothers, the sphere of everlasting transformation, Gestaltung, Umgestaltung, des ewigen Sinnes ewige Unterhaltung, umschwebt von Bildern aller Kreatur. Although the sketchy delineation of the image in Iphigenie lacks the feature of timelessness and spacelessness attendant upon the transcen- dental concept of the Mothers, it is marked by the notion of the con- tinuity of life and the metamorphic persistence of the past : Vor ihnen steigt ein Dampf vom Acheron; in seinen Wolkenkreisen wälzet sich die ewige Betrachtung des Geschehnen verwirrend um des Schuld'gen Haupt umher . . . Paradoxically attracting and frightening at the same time, the picture</page><page sequence="10">1 64 HELM UT REHDER of the cavern suggests the dialectics of an absolute - the idea of the "All" and that of mere empty space, the "Nichts." - "In deinem Nichts hoff5 ich das All zu finden," Faust remarks to Mephistopheles in the later passage dealing with the realm of the Mothers. The Italian journey marks a turning point in Goethe's symbolic usage. Up to this point the imagery of the cave reflected a state of solicitude in Goethe's own intellectual experience and a struggle for certainty in matters metaphysical. Now it becomes something of a fixed design in the store of his poetic equipment without losing its lyrical appeal and imaginative urgency. This change is noticeable even a short time after Goethe's arrival in Rome. "Today I visited the nymph Egeria," he writes laconically without indicating that he visited and sketched a grotto which under former circumstances might have elicited meta- physical ecstasies. Eighteen months later, a few days before his departure from Rome, he emerges rather disillusioned from some of the more famous Roman caverns, the Cloaca Massima and the Catacombs, and prefers to have himself entertained by what he reads about them in the book Roma sot err anea (1632), by Antonio Bosio. The fact is that for the next two decades the imagery of the cave becomes a literary device or a recurring stage setting, projecting itself with ease into many works or plans in verse or prose. This applies to Nausikaa and Die natürliche Tochter as well as to the many theatrical preludes and allegorical "Maskenzüge" ; it applies to Goethe's continuation of the Zauberflöte as much as to the intricate compositional pattern of the Märchen. Echo- ing a familiar theme, the image reappears in the Wahlverwandtschaften where Ottilie is fascinated by the notion of the ancients who imagined their ancestors sitting on thrones in large caverns, in silent communion with one another and rising to bow to any newcomer worthy of such welcome. On the surface, the repeated use of pictorial elements in which a deeper meaning has been conveniently externalized seems to indicate a development toward the ornamental and allegorical. Often the image is associated with treasures and gold, the most dominant symbol in Goethe's imagery. A tendency toward the "tableau" develops in which the image of the cave suggests aboriginal wilderness from which man is to be raised by the gift of reason and formative imagination. The opening scene of Pandora, for example, is visualized in a setting "im großen Stil nach Poussinischer Weise." In a monumental sweep the stage is divided into two realms, that of Prometheus, characterized by "Fels und Gebirg, aus dessen mächtigen Bänken und Massen natür- liche und künstliche Höhlen neben- und übereinander gebildet sind, ... bis sich das Ganze in einen waldigen Gipfel endigt," - and the</page><page sequence="11">Studies in Goethe's Poetic Imagery, I 1 65 realm of Epimetheus, which is pictured by venerable buildings equipped with articles of comfort and enjoyment and surrounded by well-culti- vated gardens. The entire tableau strikes us like a lesson in cultural anthropology in which the troglodytic empire of Prometheus represents a precarious imbalance compared with the relatively serene abode of his brother and opponent. The principle of contrast which in Iphigenie had transformed a human "Ur-Situation" into a dramatically effective scene seems to have crystallized into a panoramic allegory which exercises a stifling effect in advance of the dignified rhetoric of the play. But the imagery of the surface is deceptive. As an allegory Pandora is no mere "tableau" projecting human qualities onto the greater screen of mythological eventuality; the two realms that appear so balanced in placid aesthetic juxtaposition are more than the poetic visualization of the active and the contemplative modes of human existence. Even though the action of the play involves the most fundamental human emotions, one senses that it is actually concerned with an infinitely larger objective in that it aims to exemplify and impersonate the powers that be, the "himmlische Mächte" themselves. Orestes' Tartarus vision in Iphigenie and Faust's self-scrutiny in "Wald und Höhle" served to portray man in the act of transcending. In Pandora Goethe reaches out, as it were, to portray transcendence itself; the world of Prometheus, after all, is not the sphere of man but rather that of the "maker" of man. If the two decades of Goethe's poetic productivity following the Italian journey can at all be characterized by a consistent pattern, program, or formula, it is that of injecting into the temporal human world ever- recurring signals of the world of transcendence behind it. It is in this sense that the realms of Prometheus and Epimetheus together can come to present the totality of life, but only in constant polarity and tension with one another, in an alternation of anticipation and recollection, en- joyment and privation, consummation and nonfulfillment; and in this sense the crude, aboriginal caves of Prometheus' metalworkers can sig- nify as much the protophenomenon of man's first external orientation - space - as the limited comfort of Epimetheus and his shepherds and tillers of the land reflects the dimension of man's painful discovery of his inner self - time. The meaning of transcendence must not be misunderstood. If it is to signify a world "beyond," its comprehension is clearly ruled out by the self-restriction of the aged Faust : Nach drüben ist die Aussicht uns verrannt; Tor, wer dorthin die Augen blinzelnd richtet, sich über Wolken seinesgleichen dichtet!</page><page sequence="12">1 66 HELM UT REHDER However, as the world "within" transcendence is the very substance and objective of Goethe's poetic endeavor. Whether it is conceived as the "Gesetz, wonach du angetreten," as the "inner form" which deter- mines the manifestations of individual character, as the law of meta- morphosis which provides for every living being its appropriate form of self-realization, or as the ultimate equilibrium between individual endeavor and universal mercy, it occupies Goethe's poetic vision in an unending variety of symbolic forms. No other single and meaningful situation expresses Goethe's poetic program of the post-Italian decades more strikingly than that of the "Prologue in Heaven" - that ingenious device whereby the reader is "let in," as it were, on the secret and inner agreement among the ruling powers of existence concerning the fates of Faust, while Faust himself, the representative of man, has to grope his own way through the darkness of his own striving. Theoretically, this amounts to an enormous gamble: without "knowing" it, man is to fulfill what transcendence has willed for him. Structurally, this situation bears a striking resemblance to one of the most enigmatic themes in Goethe's writings - the Society of the Tower in Wilhelm Meister. No human organization can assume with impunity to direct the fates of a single individual. If it does, and we are made to believe that it does, it derives its authority from transcendence itself. But what is transcend- ence except "God and the Devil" in a secret and impenetrable agree- ment concerning man's fate? Accordingly, the "Gesellschaft vom Turm" is an anthropomorphic formula for the "Gesetz, wonach du angetreten," a configuration of Wilhelm Meister's own inner potenti- alities, and these are the potentialities of imagination and intellect with which man, since the beginnings of memory, has attempted to duplicate and imitate life on the levels of intuition and abstraction, that is, on the levels of the arts and the sciences. Goethe had accustomed himself to this device of the "Tower," that is, the "Blick von oben," ever since he subjected Egmont to the Duke of Alba's cold-blooded verdict "from above." With his powers of fore- thought, his ubiquitousness and efficacy, Alba combines features of Prometheus and Mephistopheles alike, the potentially divine and the demonic. Compared with Alba, the "Gesellschaft vom Turm" appears to be but a proliferation of the same principle - the principle of reason which concerns itself with the essence of things, "die Eigenschaften der Dinge," and which, accordingly, "die Art, wie sie bestehen, genau und immer genauer kennen lernt, (so) daß sie die Reihe der Gestalten übersieht und die verschiedenen charakteristischen Formen nebenein- ander zu stellen und nachzuahmen weiß." Significantly, on account of his preoccupation with art in Italy, Goethe had come to describe this</page><page sequence="13">Studies in Goethe's Poetic Imagery, I 167 principle as "Stil" or as a power of reason which is based "on the essence of things insofar as we are allowed to comprehend it in visible and tangible configurations." It is this faculty of "Stil" as the power of abstraction, anticipation and penetrating discernment which character- izes the pallid members of the Society of the Tower as it characterized the gaunt personality of the Duke of Alba. It is in keeping with this development toward a predominantly for- malistic and aesthetic conception of life that the image of the cave finds expression in Wilhelm Meister, in a manner which is greatly stylized and quite removed from the association with forest and wilderness. We might suspect that in a novel in which Goethe placed particular empha- sis on the realization of Memento vivere, little space is left for the dis- play of symbols signifying the transcendental. Nevertheless, even Wil- helm Meister contains its cave image, however formalized. In the same castle in which Wilhelm encounters the Society of the Tower he also comes upon a mysterious crypt - the Hall of the Past. The room, to be sure, bears no resemblance whatsoever to any of the familiar cave imagery; even the impression of darkness and empty space has been superseded by one of serenity and dignified order. The function to which the Hall is put, its carefully designed symbolization of the universe, and the artful emphasis on an everpresent consciousness of life suggest that art has taken over the role of nature and that the sanctuary has replaced the function of the cave. What Faust experienced in his soliloquy in "Wald und Höhle" appears resolved on a higher level: "[Es] schien jeder, der hereintrat, über sich selber erhoben zu sein, indem er durch die zusammentreffende Kunst erst erfuhr, was der Mensch sei und was er sein könne." If it is the implied purpose of this Hall of the Past to remind individ- ual man of his origin and foundation in a higher, universal order of things, and to integrate his individual self into the idea of an ever- present totality of Being, then every detail of this seemingly static symbol must be keyed to the act of transcending. By virtue of its design and its implements, this Hall is no ordinary place of worship, purification, or edification. It permits of no community of worshippers. In its appear- ance it addresses itself to the individual alone, demanding of him the effort of transcending in the clarity of thinking. Although it is a sepul- chre, the signs of art and life exclude any hint of death and grave. It is significant - and almost grotesque - that Mignon, that mysterious hu- man being in whom reality and transcendence have an equal share, suddenly collapses in this very crypt and that neither her death nor her obsequies interfere with the prevalent spirit of serenity. For now it be- comes manifest that all along Mignon has led her life in a continuous,</page><page sequence="14">1 68 HELMUT REHDER though unconscious, process of relating the external to the internal world ; and in retrospect we realize that her soul-stirring song of yearn- ing, "Kennst du das Land," actually envisaged the two separate realms merged - the realm of Being ("Es glänzt der Saal, es schimmert das Gemach") and that of individual human existence and guilt ("In Höhlen wohnt der Drachen alte Brut") - the realm of the sanctuary and that of the cave. Ultimately Goethe reserved the symbol of the cave for the realization of a purpose for which neither the dimensions of realism nor those of allegory were fully adequate - the poetic rendition of the creative act. The Second Part of Faust gathers the yield which had been accumulat- ing since Wilhelm Meister, Pandora, and other works from the post- Italian period. Whether he dealt with the genesis of poetry, in the spe- cific and quasi-mythological account of Euphorion's miraculous birth and fantastic evolution, or with poetic interpretation of a universe that knows no death but only transfiguration, both times Goethe employed the image of the cave in order to make the mystery of transcending manifest. Significantly, both times he proceeded from the specific stage setting, enlarging upon it either in a supremely playful gesture or ironic commentary or in a profoundly serious mood of the sublime. Each time the situation suggests the "Urphänomen" of "Wald und Höhle." The range of rocky caverns and shadowy groves at the beginning of the Arcadian Idyl of Act III, and the concluding scene of Faust, with its "Bergschluchten. Wald. Fels. Einöde. Heilige Anachoreten, gebirgauf verteilt, gelagert zwischen Klüften," intimate "Weltenräume" and "unerforschte Tiefen" that reach beyond the limits of empirical orien- tation. No longer applying to realities, such scenes bestow upon the cave image the symbolic meaning of a primordial landscape that has no counterpart in place or time. On a background that was possibly in- tended to convey the idea of "Schöpfungs-Genuß von innen" (Para- lipomenon 1 ) , the cave metaphor loses its incidental character. Even though literature and art of the Renaissance and the Baroque cultivated this symbol of mystery in many variations, it would be a fruit- less undertaking in literary speleology to attempt to establish any kind of priority. In this respect the works of Novalis and Tieck render as vast a yield as those of Wieland and Zachariae, or those of Shelley and Shakespeare, Tasso and Ariosto, Virgil and Homer. The eccentricities of courtly society during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries that led to the construction of grottos in formal and informal gardens were as much responsible for the preservation of the symbol of the cave as were the ritualism of the secret societies and the terminology of the alchemists.

Among such precursors in the history of thought and style, Goethe's use of the mysterious image of the cave offers a spectacle of engaging consistency. It is immaterial whether it signifies the depth of human consciousness or the mystery of creativeness, whether it stands for the void of the unknown or for the wilderness of primitive desires. It pos- sesses something of all of these - in the form of an individual meaning- ful image, rounded out to a single significant scene in which man is portrayed in the fundamental situation of seeking to comprehend him- self* The University of Texas Austin * Editor's note : Part II of Studies in Goethe's Poetic Imagery will appear in Texas Studies in Literature and Language for October, 1964.</page></plain_text>
