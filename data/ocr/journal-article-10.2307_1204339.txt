Gallup, Jr. / State University of New York at Albany Regardless of culture, race, or time in recorded history, to be a member of the human species is to be capable of theistic thought. Even if one claims not to believe in God, most people still have the capacity to conceive of a supreme being. It may be among the earliest of humanity's abstract con- cepts and, according to some, perhaps its most profound. Theism, or the ability to conceive of a God, has yet to be adequately studied by objective methods. One possible reason for this lacuna in schol- arship is that previous theories and methods of study were often at odds with the scientific method. In this article, we ask, By what mechanism or process did theism appear as an attribute of some forms of life? In which of the various prehistoric species of the genus Homo did this ability first arise? Do only humans or can other species conceive of God? Suggesting answers to these questions is our primary goal. Moreover, the theory that we pres- ent is, unlike its predecessors, potentially testable. This article is organized so that religious explanations of the human ability to conceive of God are presented first, followed by three concepts that underlie our theory of theogony (i.e., self-awareness, mind, fore- knowledge of death) and the place of mind and God in evolution. Throughout we tend to mix evidence from human and animal studies. *The views expressed here are ours only and do not necessarily reflect those of the National Institute of Mental Health.

Yet theology is not alone in espousing ontological positions. Psychology, too, has entertained various forms of ontological theory, such as, for example, gestalt psychology, psychoanalysis and Jungian psy- chology, instinct theory, and, more currently, the computer analogy to "hard-wired" behaviors. Carl Jung, the philosopher/psychoanalyst, appears to fit the ontological school of thought.2 For Jung, the concept of God is an archetype; the symbol of self and the God image are essentially indistinguishable. Jungian theory's usefulness is limited because its termi- nology is not tied to observable events and is, therefore, difficult to study by the scientific method. Scientific theories are most useful when they make predictions that are potentially falsifiable. Theories that incorporate innate complex behav- iors have traditionally been difficult to falsify. Whatever the philosophic arguments for or against the ontological claim, the theory is rendered more a matter of faith than fact in light of contemporary evidence. Evolutionary Theory of Teilhard de Chardin3 Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was both a Jesuit priest and a renowned pale- ontologist. This unusual perspective allowed him to consider the emer- gence of thought or reflection within an evolutionary framework.4 His terminology, unfortunately, is not always clear, as in, for example, his use of the words "thought" and "mind." "Mind" is nebulously equated with terms like "psyche," "radial energy," "soul spirit," and the "within of things." In his view, evolution was teleologic, but this notion of design, purpose, or guided self-actualization is what biologists see as an essentially I Paul Tillich, A History of Christian Thought, 2d ed. of lectures recorded and edited by Peter H.

Evolution occurs by selection, not by design, and the raw material for such selection is mere genetic accidents in the form of random mutations. Evolutionists have speculated on the First Cause (e.g., the big bang theory of the origin of the universe or the origin of life in a primordial "soup" of amino acids). But not knowing the origin of all things does not diminish their theory because the theory is capable of ordering knowl- edge, explaining much of what is known, and generating testable predic- tions. Beyond the First Cause, mutations, random combinations, and permutations of desoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), in the context of enor- mous periods of time, become the basis for the workings of an evolution- ary process. Even in the short run, the particular features of our individual morphology and psychology seem determined largely by the accidental juncture of social intercourse, sexual congress, and, ulti- mately, fusion of sperm and egg with their complement of twenty-three chromosomes. People may choose to see purpose in these events, but none is, in fact, required.5 A second difficulty with the evolutionary theory of Teilhard de Chardin is that it invokes a mechanism by analogy. In describing the origin of the human mind, the ability to reflect, he leads the reader "to imagine the mechanism involved in the critical threshold of reflection" by taking a series of sections from the base toward the summit of a cone.6 Each cut through the cone is a step in the development toward an ultimate anthro- poid, Man. "Then suddenly, with another infinitesimal displacement, the surface vanishes leaving us with a point. By a tiny 'tangential' increase, the 'radial' was turned back on itself and so to speak took an infinite leap for- ward. Outwardly, almost nothing in the organs had changed. But in depth, a great revolution had taken place: consciousness was now leaping and boiling in a space of super-sensory relationships and representations; and simultaneously consciousness was capable of perceiving itself in the con- centrated simplicity of its faculties."' In certain respects we are sympathetic with Teilhard de Chardin's view. He is a monist, believing that the "interiority" of human life is an attribute of matter itself. By definition, monism eliminates the mind-body distinc- tion and any other form of ontological dualism. The basis of theistic thought is material in nature, and, in this regard, our position is consistent with his theory.

HUMAN UNIQUENESS: ARE HUMAN BEINGS A DISTINCT BREAK IN THE EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS? In spite of a similar morphology to other anthropoids, Teilhard de Chardin persists in defining Man, because of his spiritual faculties, as a qualitatively distinct life form. That is, Man's spirituality separates him from other species. We question this assumption. The distinct break between the human species and other animals has been claimed on the basis of (1) tool use, (2) language, (3) thought, (4) self-concept, (5) culture, (6) insight, (7) adornment behavior, (8) cooperation, (9) politics, (10) art, (11) hunting, (12) deception, (13) cross-modal perception, (14) mental ill- ness, (15) consciousness, (16) murder, (17) incest avoidance, and (18) rep- resentation. None of these abilities are as unique as previously thought in light of what is now known about animal behavior.9 We do not know whether species other than our own have the capacity for theistic thought, but most religions deny the possibility. That is, while many animals have been venerated and worshiped as gods, animals them- selves are not widely believed to be able to conceive of a God. The absence of a theoretical framework for making predictions about which species should or should not be capable of theistic thought may be one reason that there is no objective evidence for theism in animals. An inquiring person might ask, Why is only one species, Homo sapiens, able to conceive of a God (or Gods)? Moreover, why do these Gods so often, in whole or part, take on human form, values, emotions, and behav- iors? From the vanity and vengeance of Homeric gods to the jealous God of the Old Testament, to Lucifer the god that lost in the struggle for supremacy, to the modern views of Jesus Christ as the Manlike God who offers salvation from the limitations of human life and history, human gods have emotions, hold grudges, and think, act, and sound very much like the humans whose destinies they are said to control. How might this state of thought have arisen, given our current knowl- 8 See Gordon G. Gallup, Jr., "Do Minds Exist in Species Other than Our Own?"

In the next section we propose a mechanism that accounts for God in the mind of human beings, raise the possibility that a few other creatures conceive of a God, and offer some testable predictions. A THEOGONY THEORY We begin with a relatively simple theory that is based on a substantial body of behavioral literature, and, most important, like its extension to theistic thought, makes predictions that are potentially testable. What is proposed is a mechanism by which humans, and perhaps other species, may con- ceive of God; it is not intended to prove or disprove the existence or non- existence of a God or Gods independent of the human mind. The Self-Concept While the self has been an elusive entity, certainly one that would seem difficult to demonstrate in other species, it turns out to be relatively easy to give the self objective status. An organism with a self-concept is an organism that can become the object of its own attention. Self-awareness is the capacity to be aware of being aware. Awareness is one thing, but, clearly, to be aware of being aware is quite another-indeed, it is what is often meant by "being conscious." Either you are aware of being aware (in the sense that you are aware of the words on this page), or you are unaware of being aware. And to be unaware of being aware is tantamount to being unconscious. Three examples will serve to make this point. In the first, take people who sleepwalk. Sleepwalkers rarely bump into doors, walk into walls, trip over chairs, or fall down the stairs. Yet, they remain completely oblivious to what they are doing (i.e., they are unaware of being aware). In order to perform a task appropriately you do not have to be aware of what you are doing. As another case in point, people who watch themselves on videotape for the first time often see themselves engaged in a variety of behaviors and mannerisms of which they were never aware. Finally, anx- ious people are often not aware of their anxiety, but once it reaches a threshold of consciousness, their awareness serves to create even more anxiety. Indeed, it is frequently the psychotherapist's task to train people to become more aware of themselves. In this manner they recognize when they are anxious and learn to cope with it. So there is only one kind of conscious awareness, self-awareness. If a species fails to show evidence of being aware of its own existence, then, much like the sleepwalker, there is no compelling reason to suppose that it is aware of what it is doing. 519</page><page sequence="6">The Journal of Religion Determination of Self-Awareness How does one determine which species have the capacity for self- awareness? One simple and fairly straightforward way to see if an organ- ism is capable of becoming the object of its own attention is to confront it with a mirror. Mirrors enable organisms to see themselves as they are being seen by others; in front of a mirror an organism is literally the object of its own attention. Unlike humans, however, most species react to them- selves in mirrors as if they were seeing other organisms. Even after pro- longed periods of exposure, most species apparently fail to realize that their behavior is the source of the behavior depicted in the reflection. Working with chimpanzees, one of us (Gallup) devised a technique for measuring mirror self-recognition.'0 Each chimpanzee was placed in a room by itself, in a small cage, in front of a full-length mirror, and left there for ten days. For the first few days, all of the chimpanzees reacted to seeing themselves in mirrors as though they were seeing another chim- panzee, but after the third or fourth day their behavior changed. Rather than respond to the mirror as such, they began to use the mirror to respond to themselves (in the sense of looking at and manipulating parts of their bodies that they had never seen before). For example, they made faces at the mirror, looked at the inside of their mouths, and groomed parts of their bodies that could not otherwise be seen. In other words, the animals began to behave as if they had succeeded in correctly deciphering mirrored information about themselves; that is, they had come to realize that their behavior was the source of the behavior depicted in the mirror. After the tenth day of mirror exposure, an objective test of self- recognition was initiated. Each chimpanzee was anesthetized and re- moved from its cage. Gallup then applied a bright, red, odorless, nonirritating, alcohol-soluble dye to the uppermost portion of an eyebrow ridge and to the top half of the opposite ear. The animal was then placed back into its cage and allowed to recover from anesthesia in the absence of the mirror. There are three special properties to this procedure. First, since the dye was applied while the subjects were unconscious, they would have no information about the application of these marks. Second, the dye was carefully chosen to be free of any olfactory or tactile cues once it had dried. Lastly, the marks were strategically applied to facial features that the chimpanzee could not see in the absence of a mirror. Upon recovery from anesthesia, the mirror was reintroduced as an explicit test of self-recognition. All of the chimpanzees began to use the mirror to reach up and touch the marks on their eyebrows and ears and 10 Gordon G. Gallup, Jr., "Chimpanzees: Self-Recognition," Science 167 (1970): 86-87. 520</page><page sequence="7">Theism and Natural Selection would often look directly at or even attempt to smell their fingers that had made contact with the marks. As a control condition, several chim- panzees without prior mirror exposure were anesthetized and marked, but upon regaining consciousness, these animals showed no attempt to locate the marks. These basic findings of self-recognition by chimpanzees have been replicated a number of times, in several different settings, by a number of different investigators, and they have been extended to include orang- utans." To date, however, only three species have passed the mirror test: orangutans, chimpanzees, and humans. Many other primates have been tested using a variety of procedures, and none have shown any indication that they were capable of recognizing themselves in a mirror. Self-recognition or consciousness alone may be a necessary but hardly sufficient condition to allow an organism the cognitive capacity to con- ceive of God. What is needed is mind, and it is to that definition that we now turn. A Theory of Mind The initial theoretical framework was developed by Gallup'2 and pre- sented in more detail later (1985) in a paper entitled, "Do Minds Exist in Species Other than Our Own?"'3 In this paper, Gallup argues that self- awareness, consciousness, and mind are all part and parcel of the same fundamental capacity that, in and of itself, is quite separate from learning, memory, reasoning, and emotion. The central issue posed by Gallup's theory is that organisms that are aware of themselves are in a unique psychological position. To be aware of being aware gives one the opportunity to use experience in order to infer the probable experience of others and make attributions about states of mind in others. Given a knowledge of your own mental states and how they vary as a function of events in the environment, you now have a means of modeling mine. Knowledge of self, in other words, provides a means of achieving an intuitive knowledge of others. This ability, in turn, sets the stage for the development of a variety of increasingly sophisticated, introspectively based social strategies. Clearly, to be able to predict and anticipate what others might do, based on an ability to model their mental life, would rep- I' Susan D. Suarez and Gordon G.

Gallup has argued that lying, sympathy, empathy, gratitude, grudging, attribu- tion, and sorrow are all a reflection of this underlying capacity. Each of these states relies on one's ability to use personal experience as a means of inferring comparable experiences in others. To empathize, for example, is predicated on the ability to reflect on your own unpleasant experiences as a means of attempting to vicariously appreciate the cur- rently unpleasant experience of someone else. Much the same is true of instances of intentional deception. To be effective you must anticipate your opponent's likely interpretation and response to such misinforma- tion so as to minimize the chances of being detected. Mind, therefore, is defined by the ability to (1) reflect on one's own thoughts and emotions (i.e., to be aware of being aware) and (2) to use this capacity as a basis for inferring the experience of others. Psycholo- gists have spoken of the second ability as "projection" and "anthropomor- phism" when humans attribute human or human-like emotions or thoughts to species other than our own. This definition does not claim that we always and necessarily are aware of our thoughts. On the con- trary, many human actions are automatic and reflexive, and it is likely that some, if not most, of our deeply held cognitions are below our usual level of awareness. Yet, when we choose to, we can introspect and observe to ourselves that we are thinking, humming a tune, working out a strategy for solving a puzzle, or that we are lonely, sad, happy, worry- ing, or hungry. We frequently attribute to others the experiences and emotions we observe in ourselves. If I can reflect on my own thoughts, so too must oth- ers have this capacity. In point of fact, we rarely think about others having self-awareness. The attribution is so implicit in our reactions to our envi- ronment it is as if it were "hard-wired" into our nervous systems. We seem to take for granted that others are self-aware and frequently generalize these inferences to animals. Statements such as "the dog is afraid to go outside" or "the dog blames me for not feeding him on time" or "my dog thinks he is human" are commonplace and involve the ability to reflect on what it must be like to feel "afraid" or to place "blame on someone else" or to "think one is human." Gallup has argued that the universal tendency of humans to make attributions about mental states in animals (anthropo- morphism) stands as prima facie evidence of mind in our own species.'4 14 What is less clear is the relation between the evolution of symbolic manipulation and the power that this gives to intra- and interpersonal manipulation. The influence of symbols in reli- gion appears to be great, but its ontologic and phylogenetic development is still a matter of con- siderable controversy and study in psychology. Partly for this reason, we do not attempt to bring symbolic manipulation into this article in further detail. 522</page><page sequence="9">Theism and Natural Selection According to the present formulation, God, as the ultimate attribution, is a natural extension of our ability to reflect on our own mental states. We typically use these reflections as a model for presuming the mental life of others, but a logical extension of that capacity is to use these reflections to infer the mentality of a theistic entity. Evidence of Mind In this section we illustrate what it means to have a mind and provide evi- dence of attribution in animals. One of the best ways to illustrate what it means to have a mind is to describe several instances of mindlessness. Humans often tend to take mind for granted, and, furthermore, we are so immersed in mind that we are usually oblivious to its activity. Let us start with an example drawn from neuropsychology called "blindsight." People who sustain extensive damage to the occipital cortex of the brain are often rendered blind, even though their peripheral visual system (eyes, optic nerve) is left intact. It was long assumed that such per- sons were indeed blind, but in 1974 a team of British investigators led by Larry Weiskrantz decided to confirm experimentally this apparent lack of sight.'" Weiskrantz discovered that, if such patients were encouraged to adopt (what amounted to) guessing strategies about the location or even the shape of objects they could not ostensibly see, the subject showed an uncanny degree of accuracy. In other words, vision in such patients has been reduced to a mindless sensation. They can still "see," but they are no longer aware of being aware of visual functions. Visual events have been rendered unconscious. As a no less dramatic illustration of what it would mean to be mindless, take the case of the unfortunate dog who hasjust had an encounter with a porcupine. The dog's nose is suddenly punctured in several places by porcupine quills. One option for the owner is to extract the quills with a pair of pliers. For most pet owners that would be an excruciating ordeal. Not that we would experience any physical pain from the procedure, but it would prove practically impossible not to empathize with what we assume to be going on inside the dog's "mind" as the quills are pulled out of its nose. Because of our prior experience with pain, it would be diffi- cult not to impute the presence of a painful experience to the dog as we watch its reaction. But how would another dog witnessing this transaction react? Would the other dog show signs of concern or sympathy for the victim? Certainly not. In other words, because of their inability to conceive of themselves, 15 Larry Weiskrantz, E. K. Warrington, M. D. Sanders, andJ. Marshall, "Visual Capacity in the Hemianopic Field following a Restricted Occipital Ablation," Brain 97 (1974): 709-28. 523</page><page sequence="10">The Journal of Religion dogs lack the capacity to use their experience to impute or model the experiences of others.'16 Chimpanzees, in contrast, should, according to the model, behave in a fundamentally different fashion as a consequence of their capacity for self- awareness. The evidence on this point has grown to where it now seems clear and compelling. David Premack and Guy Woodruff, for example, have shown chimpanzees videotapes of human actors in problem-solving situations.17 If the chimp is familiar with these situations, it will pick the correct photographic solutions. Thus, if a human is depicted in a situation in which he is trying to play a phonograph where the electrical cord is not plugged in or if he is attempting to wash a floor with a hose that is not con- nected to a faucet, the chimp will pick from an array of different photo- graphs the picture of the human plugging in the electrical cord or attaching the hose to the faucet. In other words, chimpanzees are not only capable of using their experi- ence to model the experience of other chimpanzees (just as the model would predict), but they can also generalize that experience to making inferences about the probable experience of another species (i.e., humans). It is interesting to note in this context that, when Premack and Woodruff varied the characteristics of the actor, it had an effect on the behavior of the chimpanzees. If shown a videotape of a human actor toward whom the chimpanzee is hostile, rather than picking "correct" photographic solutions, the chimpanzee will often choose photographs depicting the human actor involved in untoward outcomes (e.g., falling over a stack of boxes). We can turn to some ingenious research conducted by Emil Menzel as yet another illustration of the chimpanzee's capacity for mind.'8 Menzel's experimental paradigm was one that represented an approximation to a Follow-the-Leader task. That is, a single chimpanzee was taken to a large outdoor enclosure and shown a bunch of bananas. This informed animal was then returned to a compound containing other chimps that could not see the location of the bananas. All subjects were then released into the enclosure at once. Over a series of such trials some intriguing and relevant patterns of behavior emerged. Initially, as might be expected, the uninformed chimps learned to follow the informant to the bananas. As time went on, some of the uninformed chimpanzees developed an extrapolation strat- 16 See Gallup, "Do Minds Exist in Species Other than Our Own?" for a more extended treat- ment of this example and its implications. 17 David Premack and Guy Woodruff, "Does the Chimpanzee Have a Theory of Mind?"

Menzel, Jr., "Natural Language of Young Chimpanzees," New Scientist (January 15, 1975), pp. 127-30. 524</page><page sequence="11">Theism and Natural Selection egy. They would watch the direction taken by the leader and would then run ahead of him in an apparent attempt to reach the bananas first. The informed chimpanzee learned to respond to this development by moving initially in directions away from the bananas and then quickly doubling back as the others were off on a "wild goose chase." Finally, in response to this adaptive strategy, the other animals abandoned an extrapolation tac- tic and reverted to keeping the informed chimpanzee under careful sur- veillance. Contained in these episodes are some obvious and compelling instances of attribution, deliberate deception, and the development of counterdeception strategies, all of which require an ability to model the experience of others based on the use of subtle nonverbal cues. In addition to those described so far, there are some other obvious ways to test this model. For an organism that can conceive of itself, prior expe- rience with visual obstructions (e.g., blindfolds) should have interesting implications for how it responds to another comparably obstructed organ- ism; that is, if now confronted with a blindfolded companion, would it respond as if it understood that the companion could not see? Alternatively, one could teach an organism to attract the attention of humans by vocalizing for food. If the subject were then given experience with auditory obstructions (e.g., earmuffs, headphones), how would it react to a human wearing headphones? That is, would it vocalize louder to compensate for the obstruction? There should be obvious and dramatic differences between species on these kinds of tasks as a function of whether they can use their experience to impute comparable experience to others. The Concept of Death We contend that mind is a necessary but not sufficient condition for theis- tic thought. A motivational aspect to the theory is needed to explain the strong, compelling hold that theistic thought has on the lives of so many people. We maintain that the capacity to conceive of God comes with mind, but the primary driving force is the understanding that the self is subject to annihilation. The organism, which is aware of itself, and bearing witness to the demise of its associates, should be able to take the next logical step and conceive of a nonself, or its death.'9 Once aware of one's own existence, one is in a position to contemplate eventual nonexistence. The realization of the inevitability of our own demise is the unique price paid for self- awareness. In terms of our theory, death is a major motivational compo- 19 See Gordon G. Gallup, Jr., "Self-Awareness in Primates," American Scientist 67 (1979): 417-21. 525</page><page sequence="12">The Journal of Religion nent forcing into use our cognitive capacity to conceive of God. This point is potentially testable in chimpanzees and young children. Foreknowledge of one's own death is the final step in elaborating Gallup's theory to include theistic thought. That step is the ultimate attri- bution based on self-awareness: conception of a God with human charac- teristics, whose roles include providing for some type of continued existence of self after death. Although belief in God springs primarily from this basic attributional capacity and the need to deal psychologically with existential terror or despair, it is not the only motivating force in our lives. Humans have many needs, among which are love, explanations of our existence and purpose, and seeking the causes of catastrophic life events and the inexplicable. While all such needs might contribute to the use of and maintenance of theistic thought, the formulation presented here demands that concern over death of the self play a dominant role. The relative prominance of death as a factor in theism is also a testable proposition. It is not known whether the members of any species other than Homo sapiens can foresee their own death. Naturalistic reports exist on the reac- tions of animals in response to the death of a conspecific. Chimpanzees dis- play behavior suggesting that they grieve over the death of specific individuals of their species,20 but whether they understand that the same fate awaits them is unknown. If they do not, then, for these species, the motivational aspect of our theory would seem to be missing. A dying animal without a mind and whose biological systems are break- ing down may feel terribly ill; it may be too debilitated to hunt or defend against a predator. Yet at a cognitive level, animals cannot understand that their existence is about to terminate. They merely feel severely ill. Animals with a mind are predicted to react differently to severe illness and impending death. Chimpanzees have minds. They may even be able to conceive of a God, but without foreknowledge that they will die, there is no great motivational reason for the notion of God to be a paramount feature in their lives. We would predict that, if chimpanzees (and other animals with minds) could be taught to understand their own impending death, if they understood existential terror, then the notion of a God might become a more central and maintained concept. Nor is it known at which point in our own evolution the genus Homo attained this ability. Neanderthal man may have had the capacity for theis- tic cognition. We do not know if Neanderthal man could recognize him- self in a mirror, but he did bury his dead. That such burials had special 20 G. Teleki, "Group Response to the Accidental Death of a Chimpanzee in Gombe National Park, Tanzania," Folia Primatologica 20 (1973): 81-94. 526</page><page sequence="13">Theism and Natural Selection psychological significance is illustrated by the fact that, within their grave sites, archaeologists have found flowers and tools.21 If Neanderthal man had a mind and could conceive of his own death, then, as we will attempt to show, he could also have conceived of God and an afterlife in which tools would be put to use. Perhaps these facts will someday be brought to light by anthropologists. Many centuries later we know that the ancient Greeks were troubled by fate and death. Their mythology provided for Hades as a location for an afterlife existence, and Plato wrote that providence, coming from the highest God, gives us the courage to escape the vicissitudes of fate. Plato's considerations of providence were an ancient attempt to assuage man's fear of his ultimate fate. According to Paul Tillich, one of Plato's major contributions was preparing Christianity for "the Christ to overcome the demonic forces of fate."22 All religions deal with death in some fashion. Some do so in a highly abstract manner, others more concretely. For example, the Old Testa- ment provides little in the way of doctrine regarding an afterlife; it does focus on explaining God's role in catastrophic life events (e.g., Job). Hence, the major sects of Judaism have little formal emphasis on an after- life. The New Testament and the Koran, however, go into some detail regarding an afterlife. Not surprisingly, Christianity and Islam place great stress on disposition of the self after death. The Old Testament states that God created man in His own image. We would argue that just the opposite has occurred. Because of our capacity to use personal experience as a means of inferring the experience of oth- ers and because of the well-studied phenomenon of generalization, humans create God(s) in their own image, and not vice versa. In another reversal of a familiar idea, we would say that it is awareness of self that should be construed as a high-level abstraction; God then follows as a rather concrete extension of self. We are also aware that, in our culture, as God becomes more abstract, more transcendent, human form and passions in our image of God have decreased.23 But we suspect that this decrease is largely among academic theologians. When, for example, children are indoctrinated into Judeo- Christian beliefs, the concept of God is concrete and anthropomorphic, and this early acculturation is not lost on the average adult. Fundamental and emotionally expressive religions are alive and well in the United States and much of the world. It is not clear how profitable it would be to find examples in various the- 21 R. E.

Although the examples themselves could not be construed as having been predicted by the theory, we do maintain that, since theology is a man-made discipline, examples can be found. For example, in a Medieval Christian notion of the Trinity, man's ability to introspect becomes God's ability to introspect. That is, God the Father's infinite capacity to "see himself" brought forth the Logos, the second Person of the Trinity.24 THE PLACE OF MIND AND GOD IN EVOLUTION A Competitive Advantage for Survival? Evolution is a competitive process, where success in adapting to an envi- ronmental niche is defined as passing one's genetic code to the next gene- ration, allowing the most reproductively viable configurations of genes to persist. Consider "intelligence" as commonly understood. Intelligence has evolved in humans because of the advantages of competing and, at the same time, cooperating with others for scarce resources. Other species (e.g., roaches) can survive very nicely in their environmental niche with- out selection pressure to develop human-like intelligence. Over a long period of time, competition for survival and reproductive opportunities among humans became focused on those with certain psycho- logical factors, for example, these who could best deceive, empathize, rea- son, or make attributions. In these and other psychological factors, humans became differentially skilled, not only in respect to other species, but espe- cially within their own. Human intelligence is not a matter of solving prob- lems in the inanimate environment. Human intelligence is a by-product of intraspecies competition, where we have used experience to increase repro- ductive advantage. Ultimately, we are the source of our own intelligence. From a biological perspective, evolution may seem to be an orderly process. In practice, the process is hit and miss, and it occurs by selection, not design.25 It is unknown whether other species question the meaning of their lives, but humans do. For many people the meaning of life will not be found in the theory of evolution, the ultimate basis of which is genetic accidents. The process of evolution may be rationally satisfying, but for most people it is an emotional void. Emotionally, the theory of evolution does little to help one cope with existential terror. Theism and its elabora- tion into religion with dogma and ritual is what most people clearly prefer to rational explanation. 24 Thomas Aquinas, "Summa Contra Gentiles," bk. 4, Salvation (South Bend, Ind.: University of Notre Dame Press, 1975), chap. 12. 25 See Dawkins (n. 5 above). 528</page><page sequence="15">Theism and Natural Selection What humans have available to combat existential terror are a number of psychological qualities. Among these are thought to be such "defense mechanisms" as denial, repression from awareness, and the intellectual ability to generalize the attributes of mind. It is unknown whether non- human animals have the cognitive processes to deny or repress unpleasant thoughts or events, but given self-awareness, they may be able to attribute the capacity of mind, as the human species has, to the wind or sun or to an abstraction, a summa essentia, that may or may not have its own species- specific limitations. With the creation of a God or Gods, accidents and other chance events (including life itself) became explicable; living is made meaningful beyond mere genetic perpetuation, and some sort of spiritual life becomes ostensi- bly possible after the end of corporeal existence. All of this, however, rests on the ability to reflect on one's cognitions and to extend to others a simi- lar ability. Assume for a moment that species that do not show objective evidence of self-awareness (e.g., monkeys, dogs, or cats) have a well-developed concept of God. Assume that they have their own signs and symbols for God and that they worship in their own species-specific way. Such a fact would be inconsistent with the logic of our theory, and the theory would be fatally flawed. At this time, we can assume whatever we wish about other species, but until objective evidence is forthcoming,26 the present theory is tenable. If an animal is found that can predict its own death yet has no mind (by our definition), that animal would need to reach a psychological accom- modation with death by a route different than that taken by humans. That is, in the absence of mind, the theory predicts that neither God nor an afterlife for the self is conceptually possible in that species. Theism as a By-Product of Evolution Did selection pressure bring about a capacity for theistic thought? What adaptive value does theistic thought have so that it would aid in the per- petuation of genes? Most organisms succeed for long periods of time with- out self-awareness, mind, foreknowledge of death, and the concept of a God or Gods. Not every attribute is genetically coded, nor is every attri- bute of a species critical for its survival. Much of what we are (phenotypic- ally) emerges from experience, cultural transmission, and interactions with our genetic endowment. In regard to theistic thought, it seems likely that for the species this capacity is a by-product of the evolution of mind and the realization that one will someday cease to exist. 26 For example, see Suarez and Gallup (n. 11 above). 529</page><page sequence="16">The Journal of Religion Social Darwinism, cultural evolution, and group selection are types of evolutionary theory that are, in all forms, more controversial than evolu- tion by genetic mutation. At the risk of oversimplifying, the major tenet of group selection theory is that individuals forgo their own reproductive best interest in favor of the best interest of the group. Those groups that use the least energy and develop behaviors that are most efficient at survi- val (and therefore pass on their genes) are said to be the most likely to sur- vive.27 However, data that support this contention are rare. The most parsimonious explanation of natural selection remains at the level of the individual. If correct, the group selection notion would be relevant to the theory proposed here. In the absence of evidence supporting group selec- tion, there is no compelling reason to pursue the point. The evolution point of view expressed in this article also has a bearing on the ontological theory of the origin of God. We doubt that the concept of God is man's Ur-cognition, although in the history of our species it is undoubtedly of early origin. Our thesis is that mind is necessary for a con- ception of God, but in the absence of self-awareness and attribution, many species learn, adapt to changing environmental contingencies, and try alternative solutions to problems. An organism may also be mindless and, as such, cannot attribute to another that (self-awareness) which is beyond its conceptual ability. It seems highly unlikely that the first attribution of the first organism with a mind was that of God. The roles of individual experience, cultural transmission, and the high probability of making incorrect attributions when little data are available increase the doubtful- ness of God as the earliest cognition of man's mind. One might speculate on the adaptive functions of theistic thought and religion. For example, it may be that, as a by-product of an ability (e.g., mind) that was subject to selection pressure, theistic thought has no major advantage in survival. However, religion in its multiple forms may have helped cope with misfortune and loneliness, despair and suicide, and solidify a sense of community. It also fosters reciprocal altruism, sharing, and giving. But most important from the point of view of maintaining the species, religion functions to help regulate different aspects of reproductive behavior (e.g., inbreeding sanctions, birth control, marital infidelity, and homosexuality). In the case of two otherwise identical religions, the one that sanctions against the use of birth control will leave more descendants than the one that encourages contraception. All else being equal, in terms of Darwinian fitness, the former is more "fit" than the latter. 27 See V. C. Wynne-Edwards, Animal Dispersion in Relation to Social Behavior (New York: Hafner, 1962). 530</page><page sequence="17">Theism and Natural Selection LIMITATIONS This theory has a number of strengths, but it also has limitations. In the first place, it is only the beginning of an explanation. Although the theory sug- gests a number of possible tests, some are not practical at this time. Theor- ies also have value to the extent that they serve a heuristic function and/or summarize existing information. Social, developmental, and neurophysio- logical aspects of cognition are largely absent from this presentation. To elaborate on these factors seems tangential to our main thesis. Second, the reader will notice that we use the terms "self-awareness" and "introspection" as if their meanings were identical. At the very basic level at which this theory is being presented, the terms are essentially iden- tical. "Self-recognition" is the term with the most operational meaning and the least surplus meaning. Self-recognition is an objective indicator of self-awareness and introspection. Self-awareness implies a meta- awareness. Introspection usually implies a "higher" cognitive function. Future research may reveal that the ability to be aware and to introspect are functions of many smaller steps that some animals have only in part, compared to humans. Third, some have suggested that belief in God springs from a sense of awe and wonderment at our own existence and the world about us. Per- haps, but we (preferably, they) would then be in the position of defining wonderment and its psychological foundation. The case for wonderment as an explanation of our cognitive capacity to conceive of God is weakened as a scientific explanation because it makes no predictions of its own and fails to elaborate a mechanism by which it should work. In a similar vein, we have been told that the concept of God is a means of understanding and bringing order to an unknowable universe and our place in it. That may indeed be a benefit of such a belief system, but it begs the question that this article seeks to answer: by what mechanism are humans able to conceive of God? Some readers will find a fourth limitation in our unwillingness to specu- late on an abstraction called the soul. It is not clear to us what the soul might be, and, as scientists, we do not like to stray far from operational def- initions. If the soul is something other than self or mind, we leave a con- vincing demonstration to others. CONCLUSIONS In this article we have taken religious reductionism to a level not consid- ered by Daniel Pals in his 1986 article on this subject.28 We have asked by 28 See Pals (n. 1 above). 531</page><page sequence="18">The Journal of Religion what mechanism theism is a reality sui generis, and we have provided a mechanism. Although religious and evolutionary explanations have here- tofore been treated as mutually exclusive, the present account of the ori- gin of theism shows that the theory of evolution can subsume ontological explanations and religion. Unlike other theories of the origin of God, this one is potentially testable. Among the various predictions made by the theory are (1) that the con- cept of God is possessed or can be learned by chimpanzees and orangutans; (2) that the concept of personal death is possessed or can be learned by chimpanzees and orangutans; (3) that the average adult human conceives of God having human characteristics, often magnified in power, scope, and effect; (4) that people who are at the high end of a "fear of death" scale will evidence a strong belief in God; and (5) that the discipline of theology can provide numerous examples of God having human characteristics. In summary, organisms first must have the capacity of self-awareness, and it is now known that two species of great apes (chimpanzees and orangutans), along with human beings, have this ability. Second, organ- isms that have a mind not only have self-awareness but also attribute this capacity to others of their species and to other species. The presence of mind allows such species the capacity to conceive of God. Third, humans can foresee their own death, and our theory predicts that some great apes either have such knowledge or can be taught it. It follows from the theory that foreknowledge of death is the single most important motivational force for most humans to embrace belief in God. Absent any one condi- tion, theistic thought or behavior is not likely to be observed. With all three, it can be observed, but it may not.29 29 The theory also predicts that certain clinical cases may show a blunted conception of God and religious feeling. For example, there are rare clinical reports of prosopagnosia, the inability to recognize one's mirror image due to regional brain damage. Depending on the age of the brain injury, the capacity to conceive of God may not fully develop, or the patients's preinjury views of religion may be blunted in feeling and expression. 532</page></plain_text>
