<plain_text><page sequence="1">New Zealand Slavonic Journal 1978, No. 1 R. C. PORTER Irony and Morality in Solzhenitsyn's Cancer Ward In discussing the difficulties of assessing Solzhenitsyn's achieve- ment, Victor Erlich, in an article as recent as 1973, touched on a point which has been central and perennial in the debate surrounding Solzhenitsyn: "Our admiration for the man and our affinity for his stance need not determine our considered judgement of the scope and texture of the writer's achievement. A moving human testimony couched in fictional terms may or may not be a literary master- piece. At the same time we would do well to beware of the opposite danger, that of inhibiting our literary response, of underestimating the heroic writer's actual effectiveness out of an excessive distrust of our own motives, an inordinate fear of being or appearing to be swayed by extra-literary considerations."1 This dilemma would seem to have become even more acute since Solzhenitsyn's expulsion - his outrage and despair at western values alarms us - and we, no longer able to dub him a martyr, may become too harsh in our judgements. The debate goes on: Henry Gifford writes (Essays in Criticism, October 1974), "like Solzhenitsyn he [Mandelshtam] resisted the lie almost everybody else was living. But in Solzhenitsyn's case we can already see that moral courage is one thing, and high artistry another."2 In the same month no less a figure than the irrepressible Clive James wrote, "I can well remember arousing the scorn of some of my brighter contemporaries by calling Solzhenitsyn a great imaginative writer. This was put down to my customary hyperbole, to my romanticism, to my bad taste, or to all three. Yet it seemed to me a sober judgement, and still seems so. I think Solzhenitsyn is a creative artist of the very first order."3 In everything he has written Solzhenitsyn, more than any other contemporary writer, has confronted us head-on with moral prob- lems. There is no moral ambiguity, no scepticism; the doubt and uncertainty of Kafka, or the absurd, comic and grotesque of the Bulgakov-Sinyavsky kind, are alien and even hostile to Solzhenitsyn's vision. In his work we can even trace a turning-away from 'fiction' as we understand it - Avgust chetyrnadtsatogo (August 1914) is based on historical documents to some extent, and many a book- seller has been in a quandary as to whether The Gulag Archipelago 59</page><page sequence="2">should be included in his Modern History or Modern Novel section. Ambiguous fiction gives way to unequivocal statement. And absurd- ity and scepticism are re-born as irony. In contributing to the Solzhenitsyn-the-moralist or Solzhenitsyn-the-artist debate, some- times adopting mutually exclusive positions, perhaps critics un- wittingly provide a raison d'&amp;tre for the irony in Solzhenitsyn's work. It is now ten years since Rakovyy korpus (Cancer Ward) was written, and it still remains perhaps the most readable, the most accessible of Solzhenitsyn's works. On two occasions it has stood a chance of being published in the Soviet Union.4 Its ostensible subject matter is universal, non-partisan and highly topical. The irony in it is at its most subtle and sophisticated and provides the energy which generates clashes between characters, their consequent moral search, and the subsequent literary and philosophical debate. It is this pro- gression that I wish to trace, and by it to suggest, albeit tentatively, that Solzhenitsyn's artistry and Solzhenitsyn's morality, in this more than any other of his works, are perfectly harmonized and find their most eloquent expression. The world of Cancer Ward is a real world, and an ironic world. Irony in Solzhenitsyn varies from the simplest kind - saying one thing and meaning something else (sarcasm) - to something far more complex. There is, firstly, the irony of incident, where a series of events leads us to expect a certain thing and the opposite happens (we talk of 'ironic deaths' for instance); then there is the irony of appearance - the 'meat wagon' transporting the prisoners from Mavrino, or Kostoglotov's wild, vicious exterior, contrasting with his gentleness; then there is the irony of character and situation, where environmental factors produce feelings or ideas in a character which at first sight seem in direct contrast to what we would expect - in prison there is greater freedom than outside, in hospital there is greater spiritual health. The irony of incident is the most important in Cancer Ward and there are many obvious examples:- Kostoglotov is finally free to marry and settle down and gets interested in two women, just when he has to have hormone treatment which will destroy his sexuality. Dontsova is the best cancer specialist in the area, yet she too gets the disease; and even more than that, she does not trust her own diagnosis to begin with. She supports the national health service but goes to see her avuncular doctor.5 Asya, a wholly physical, sexual person, has to have a breast removed. Rusanov, a pillar of Soviet society, gets on best with Chaly, the black-marketeer. Akhmadzhan, an ostensibly reserved, passive character, turns out to be an ex-guard in a camp. None of these incidents seems at all con- trived; there is no element of sick humour or black comedy in them. They are recounted in a 'dead-pan' fashion. The lives of other charac- 60</page><page sequence="3">ters, Nellya, Zoya, Aviette, Sibgatov are so stunningly unironic that they dispel any notion of contrived irony in the novel. There is often a conflict between truth and morality. Kostoglotov is anxious to assemble all the facts for himself and then make his own decision, but he is reluctant to afford Proshka the same facilities; or again, Rusanov's son deludes two girls who work for him in order to get at the truth, and then refuses to report them out of a sense of justice; they, out of a sense of justice, fail to feel gratitude. Vadim, who has never relied on blat in his life, is now forced to resort to it when facing death. Irony begets irony; irony is continually refined. What the irony of incident does in Cancer Ward is to create a dramatic tension in the narrative and force the characters into a pemanent state of distress which in turn forces them quite naturally to rationalise their existence in all sorts of ways that would never have occurred to them back home in their natural surroundings. In V kruge pervom (The First Circle) all the characters can decide themselves whether to go 'up' or 'down' - their situation is man- made. But in Cancer Ward going 'up' or 'down' means nothing - none of the patients will be completely cured; they cannot decide whether to contract cancer or not. All they can do is re-evaluate their past and their present, and decide for themselves how best to survive for as long as possible. Only Kostoglotov gets as far as questioning to what extent it is worth being cured. Only Yefrem raises the question of a connection between being a good person and consequently being cured, and he dies ... In The First Circle there are ways 'up' out of prison, but only at high moral cost.6 In Cancer Ward Man is ultimately forced to assess morally his own life, simply because there is nothing else left to do when he faces death. Because the catalyst which forces people into greater awareness is disease, not prison, it affects nearly all the characters, for every human being, quite independently of his actions and desires, can contract a disease. The division in The First Circle between 'them' and 'us', the prisoners and the guards, disappears. One might argue that the doctors are in fact in the same position as the Mavrino guards, in that by virtue of their knowledge and skills, they hold the whip hand over the patients.7 However, it is made clear that each of the patients can leave whenever he wishes; and moreover, some of the patients rely on their own cures as much as on the doctors'. True, we can detect a certain parallel between Dontsova's fate and Volodin's, but what happens to the young diplomat is a direct result of his assertion of self; Dontsova does nothing to contract cancer. The best doctors in the hospital are painfully aware of their own shortcomings. They know that disease rules them and their 61</page><page sequence="4">science is a poor defence weapon. Moreover, mutual love and respect can exist between doctors and patients right across the board, in a way that would never be possible in Mavrino. In biographical terms Kostoglotov bears a close resemblance to Nerzhin of The First Circle and to Solzhenitsyn. But Kostoglotov has little education; he is violent at times and foul-mouthed. He does not 'philosophise'. He is an eccentric in appearance - his boots, great coat, long hair. All this adds up to a plebeian rebel.8 His arguments are never sophisticated. He takes nothing on trust from people, preferring to read things up for himself, no matter what the subject. He seems naively unaware that books are written by human beings. He places more trust in Maslennikov, a man he has never met, than in the doctors and nurses around him. He is, at bottom, irrational. Yet through this irrationality he often arrives at a more moral and valuable truth than other characters; through irrationality he asserts his self. Working things out for himself becomes a principle in itself for the hero. He does not expect to arrive at an objective truth and does not believe in one. He is terrified by the thought that there may be an established opinion on something which renders the subject closed. In his wilful searching he turns to books of all sorts: medical text books, Tolstoy, mathematics. Kostoglotov's stubborn refusal to take anything on trust brings him, with varying degrees of violence, into conflict with all the other characters. In this sense he is a more central character than Nerzhin, and the novel as a whole becomes perhaps more cohesive than The First Circle. Nerzhin is willing to read things and perhaps, in part, to adopt them. He 'tries out' various philosophies, and goes to other characters to learn from them.9 Not so Kostoglotov. All the others have some kind of external code which may benefit them or their fellow beings and which allows them to live an ordered life. Kostoglotov's life has never been ordered, and he has only himself. Because he is essentially plebeian, there is little intellectual motiv- ation; he just does things - he tends to react, rather than think. Thompson Bradley says: "His is the inner freedom of an unfree man".10 The liberation of self to this extreme degree leads to morality. Solzhenitsyn teaches us through Kostoglotov's example. But the process of becoming a Kostoglotov he cannot describe. That task he leaves to the psychologist, or less satisfactorily, to the Stalinist novelist. The 'message' would appear to be that we must rediscover ourselves, strip away the bric-a-brac of civilisation, and let our primeval instincts take over. However, the didacticism is never ham-fisted, and Solzhenitsyn is content to rely on the naturally therapeutic qualities of creative writing rather than on the more direct, but less effective approach of the pamphlet. 62</page><page sequence="5">For Kostoglotov self is paramount in importance even to the point where it becomes more valuable than life itself. As he tells Dontsova: I simply wanted to remind you of my right to dispose of my own life. No soonei does a patient come to you than you begin to do all his thinking for him. After that, the thinking's done by your standing orders, your five-minute conferences, your programme, your plan, and the honour of your medical department. And once again I become a grain of sand, just like I was in the camp. Once again nothing depends on me.11 Apart from reflecting Solzhenitsyn's own terror at being trapped by a routine or an institution, these remarks are to have a great significance for the hero later on. Hormone therapy will save his life, but at the price of his sexuality. When he finds out about the treat- ment he persuades Zoya to stop it for a while. Unlike all the other characters, there is a point for Kostoglotov at which life is not worth living, when it is better to go off into the wilds away from institut- ionalised, urbanised, civilised, educated Man, and die like an animal. This is not suicide; it is the very opposite. That first day out of hospital, first among the animals, and then setting off for the back of beyond of the Soviet Union, it is like the first and last days of creation.12 Choosing for oneself means creation which in turn means life. The expression of self to this degree is an old and estab- lished theme in Russian literature. Rusanov, the hero's most obvious adversary, represents the anti- thesis of a morally based character. He has no self; he is a bundle of slogans and pre-formed opinions.13 He will do anything to stay alive and well in a material way. He is totally given over to an external code which will benefit his body. It must be admitted that, consequently, he runs close to being a caricature.14 In Cancer Ward Solzhenitsyn has eschewed the basic form of irony, except in the case of the Rusanovs. We are told he loves the People, when in fact he loves himself. We are told Aviette is intelli- gent and comforting, when she is in fact self-seeking and stupid. There are also elements of satire in Rusanov's portrayal - he dreams of public executions. Solzhenitsyn is stuck with the same problem as he had in portraying bureaucrats, and Stalin in particular, in The First Circle: how to make real something which by his moral stand- ards is unnatural and grotesque. When discussing the novel with the Moscow writers in late 1966 he was willing to admit to some exag- geration in the depiction of Rusanov, but in the same breath, turning the conversation to Aviette, he agreed with them that she is a farce, 63</page><page sequence="6">but not his farce.15 Still, as a realistic character Rusanov has his weaknesses. Kostoglotov and Rusanov are two extremes of the Solzhenitsyn character - the clashes between them are above all on a personal rather than an intellectual level. In the row between Sologdin and Rubin we see a progression from abstract ideas to personalities. The Kostoglotov-Rusanov conflict is personal from the very start. The hero answers Stalinist slogans with obscenities, and then with less piquant but perhaps more revealing epithets. The climax comes in chapter eight of Part two, where Vadim denies the very point that Solzhenitsyn has been making all along: "We aren't robots, we don't take anything on trust."16 Kostoglotov accuses Rusanov and his breed of being racialists. The unintellectual approach turns Stalinist jargon inside out. The young Stalinist Vadim, in many ways an appealing character, the philosopher and the bureaucrat, are all silenced by Kostoglotov's hit-and-run attacks. And yet the hero becomes aware of his lack of perspective. Ironically, many of Sol- zhenitsyn's critics have ascribed to his works their own political or religious views. He has been described quite aptly as a "political football",17 and yet his hero remains politically disorientated: Was it weariness or illness that gave him this urge to yawn? Or was it because these arguments, counterarguments, technical terms, bitter, angry glances suddenly seemed so much squelching in a swamp? None of this was to be compared with the disease that afflicted them or with death, which loomed before them. He yearned for the touch of something different, something pure and unshakeable. But where he would find that Oleg had no idea.18 In Cancer Ward Solzhenitsyn prefers to describe life rather than sum it up. Oleg cannot be claimed by any part or side. And as if to stress the point by contrast, the subsequent two chapters possess a clear partisan element. Oreschenko expresses views on very specific issues. He does not search for an overall truth or maxim, but sticks to certain principles which are localised' within his profession. He advocates the re- establishment of the family doctor, the need for sex education and a measure of free enterprise. It would be petty and misguided to attribute these opinions to Solzhenitsyn, whose real aim is to stim- ulate discussion on the problem, not kill it by pontificating on it or ignoring it. The old doctor is lucky; he can hold views at variance with the system, yet still survive. The sacrifices he has to make are not great, and they are only material sacrifices. 64</page><page sequence="7">The following chapter shows us Kostoglotov with his erstwhile ally in the row with Rusanov. Shulubin has survived materially, but at a tremendous cost to his conscience. It would be even more of a mistake to take what Shulubin says as the author's own opinion. Shulubin quotes all his sources when he lectures. He has very few ideas of his own. He tells us himself the 'idols' idea is from Francis Bacon.19 The notion adds up to taking nothing on trust, especially where science is concerned. This in particular appeals to Kostoglotov. After the idols of the cave and the theatre, Shulubin refers to the idols of the market place, those pat phrases and formulae by which a total conformist must live despite his conscience. Unconsciously he is attacking his own theory of ethical socialism, for all '-isms' are idols of the market place. Shulubin is the most ironic figure in the novel. He is the one with an 'answer' to life's problems yet his life is almost over and for many years it has been useless. Moreover, his answer is the most lofty, most abstract, most idealistic, while he, in his daily life, his byt, is guided solely by material survival: he says, I know I spoke out in the ward, but I'd never dare say anything like that in Kokand, or where I work. As for what I'm telling you now, I'm only doing it because they're wheeling in a little table to take me to my operation.^0 Disease and the prospect of death have given him the freedom to speak out at last. As painfully aware as Rusanov is blissfully ignorant of his hypocrisy, Shulubin is to be pitied, even by someone as acutely conscious of and responsive to the conscience as Kostoglotov. The moral podtekst of the novel favours Kostoglotov above all; to other characters it is equivocal, and to the Rusanovs, with the exception of Yury, it is censorious. The moral 'acid test' for a character is to what extent he acts on his conscience. Rusanov has no conscience - his dream is just a harsh reminder of the enemies he has accumulated and the revenge they might seek on him. Shulubin has a conscience, but lacks the courage to act on it. Kostoglotov acts entirely on his conscience. Shulubin's words without action are interesting for the light they shed on Solzhenitsyn's own reading and thoughts, but within the moral debate in the novel, they are only of secondary importance. Shulubin expounds his theory of ethical socialism in terms that are naive and impractical: We have to show the world a society in which all relationships, fundamental principles and laws flow directly from ethics, and from them alone. Ethical demands must determine all considerations: how to bring up children, what to train them for, to what end the work of grown-ups should be directed and how their leisure should be occupied. 65</page><page sequence="8">As for scientific research, it should only be conducted where it doesn't damage morality, in the first instance where it doesn't damage the researchers themselves. The same should apply to foreign policy. Whenever the question of frontiers arises, we should think not of how much richer or stronger this or that course of action will make us, or of how it will raise our prestige. We should consider one criterion only: how far is it ethical?21 He advocates 'mutual affection' (vzaimnoye raspolozheniye) between men but does not define it or even elucidate it. All his theorising amounts to nothing but hot air. The ideas are culled from Opravdaniye dobra (The Justification of the Good) by the mystic Solovyov and Mutual Aid by Kropotkin, the anarchist. The Bol'shaya Sovetskaya Entsiklopediya makes no mention of this book in the article on Kropotkin, but its basic ideas find definite echoes in Cancer Ward. Generally speaking Mutual Aid is a rejection of Darwin's theory of the survival of the fittest, propounding rather the notion that higher animals help each other in the battle for survival, and consequently Man can learn from their example. Shulubin expounds the theory, but it is Kostoglotov who acts on it in visiting the zoo. Both Kropotkin and Solovyov, essentially nine- teenth-century men, may have been alike in temperament but hardly in their theories. Shulubin makes a hotch-potch of their ideas, throws in a quotation from Pushkin, adapts another from Herwegh, and sets himself up as a philosopher. Against Kostoglotov he looks terribly pale. His ideas are somehow divorced from his life, but they do have a certain extrinsic value in constituting a mild plea for more intellectual freedom, more books, more ideas, more healthy dissent. It is significant that he is a librarian, who deals with books of all sorts but owns none of them and is committed to none of them. The philosophical interest in Cancer Ward is subtly contrasted to the interest in literature. The literary debate follows a neat pattern and is conducted through four characters - Yefrem, Dyoma, Aviette and Yelizaveta Anatolyevna, the ward orderly. The choice is judic- iously balanced - two old people, two young, two men, two women - a boor, a naive youth, a literary hack, a sensitive reader, literature is or becomes important to all of them. Tolstoy's Chem lyudi zhivy? (What Men Live By) was written in 1882 specifically for children. It was meant to be highly moral and didactic. Yefrem, the rake, drunkard, ex-Chekist and swindler, is a difficult target for Tolstoy's moralising arrows, and yet the very setting of Cancer Ward makes a palpable hit possible. The approach of death forces Yefrem away from material things - they become irrelevant; and the irony of his situation, having cancer of the tongue, a tongue with which he has argued, sworn and lied his way 66</page><page sequence="9">through life, compels him to start a drastic moral re-assessment, or more precisely, simply to start thinking. Until now he has been amoral. He has lived by food, fresh air and drink. The idea that one lives by love suddenly makes sense to him and consequently alters all his values. Literature has worked a moral miracle on him. There is nothing contrived in this - What Men Live By sold thousands of copies in the 1880s despite, or perhaps because of , its moralising. It takes disease and possible death to bring a man to the point where like a small child, he can absorb a lesson. Some of the other patients in the ward suggest that man lives by material things, but they are further from death than Yefrem. Sibgatov suggests that man lives by his homeland, but this is just a literary touch of pathos attached to a political exile. Rusanov, as expected, comes out with a cliche. How- ever he has, unlike all the others, considered supra-material things before - his lesson has been learnt; he doesn't need a new one. To Yefrem, his answer, "people live by their ideological principles and the interests of their society," does not seem incompatible with Tolstoy's "Men live by love". And indeed they are not necessarily incompatible. Yefrem is just not quick enough to see that the 'interests of society' begs a thousand questions, whereas love' begs none. Rusanov's whole 'argument' is just a string of slogans - love has got nothing to do with his morality, he says22, and then goes on to check up on the author rather than do battle with his ideas. This chapter shows us Solzhenitsyn using inference rather than battering rams for his moralising. The full effect of Tolstoy's story is never revealed. Yefrem has only just started to think; he has only just got material things into perspective: In order to understand, he had to remember that he wasn't going to get anywhere any more, that he would never change things or convince anyone of anything, that he had only a few numbered days in which to sort out his life. Only then would the book's meaning reveal itself.23 So in this first big sequence concerning literature the moral effect and moral responsibility of the written word is made clear. With this premise in mind, we are introduced to the state and function of literature in modern society and in the Soviet Union in particular. Cancer Ward takes place at the time of 'The Thaw' and the literary debate is at last resumed after more than twenty years. As early as chapter four we are aware of Dyoma reading Pomerantsev's article on sincerity in Novyy mir and the issue is raised again when Rusanov's daughter, Aviette, arrives. 67</page><page sequence="10">The contrast in personality between Dyoma and Aviette is reflec- ted in their physical appearance. We learn of the young lad's pain and suffering and his thirst for knowledge, through history and literature mainly, before we come to know him physically. When we first meet Aviette she almost bumps into Kostoglotov; she is all movement, energy and fashionable clothes, as synthetic as her ideas. She represents the conservative literary establishment. In literature, life must be described as it will be, not as it is. It has to be optimistic and 'festive', (prazdnichnyy). Sincerity is a bad thing unless what you are being sincere about has official approval. The crassness of Stalinist theory is further exposed by Rusanov mixing up the titles of books he has read because they are all so optimistic they sound the same. The technical faults in the Stalinist socialist realist theory do not concern us here. What is important is that Aviette completely rejects sincerity in literature and hence must reject conscience and must ultimately divorce literature from morality. We have witnessed an instance of highly moral literature affecting a person considerably; but now literature without morality fails to affect anyone, even those who agree totally with its theory and practice. Aviette merely says that the titles of the books she has brought 'make you feel good', that is, they corroborate her own artificial values. Literature to her is a way of making money and involves shifting with the political sands on which the literary castle is built. Her own plans for creative literature include the describing of the collective rather than indiv- iduals and naturally, this is bound to exclude what Lukacs calls the anthropomorphic element and so produce nothing of value.24 The literature she advocates and wishes to contribute to is dedicated solely to maintaining the emotional status quo in the reader. Rusanov's emotions have been brought to such depths by non- literary things that it will take some real literature to help him, and he decides that Dumas is just the thing. All the literary theorising produces nothing. The implication is that real literature speaks for itself, and that is its danger. Perhaps we can detect a mild plea on Solzhenitsyn's part for a moratorium on literary discussions. He prefers literature to speak for itself. And on another occasion in the novel he permits himself a little sarcasm when recounting how it was deemed better for pupils to listen to lectures about Tolstoy rather than read his works for themselves, as this would be arduous and confusing. Dyoma's approach to literature is praiseworthy for its innocence. He has no theories, no pre-conceived ideas. He rejects engineering as a subject and says he is interested more in truth and social problems. The idea of sincerity in literature has caught his imagination, but he 68</page><page sequence="11">is bound to be steamrollered by Aviette simply because they are talking about different things - he about practice, and she about theory. Literary theory is just another idol of the market place. Having established the necessity for and the value of morality in literature, Solzhenitsyn proceeds to tie up the knot between the moral search conducted through Kostoglotov, Rusanov and Shulubin, which is primarily philosophically based, and the moral search that real literature in the widest sense must carry out. The aim is to justify literature in concrete social terms and abstract philosophical terms. Chapter twelve of Part two is given a deliberately 'literary' title, 'Happy ending', and is concerned with Rusanov's discharge and his mistaken belief that he is fully cured. The implication is that happy endings are false and misleading; the prime requisite of the kind of literature that Rusanov advocates is that it have a happy ending. It is a further example of Solzhenitsyn's use of irony of appearance. Chapter thirteen, the 'one a bit less happy' is the real core of the moral problem both in literary and philosophical terms and is, as the title by contrast to 'Happy ending' implies, much nearer the truth. The literary discussion between Kostoglotov and Yelizaveta Anatolyevna highlights the need for literature to develop organically in relationship to historical events, its society and its own past, along its own lines, not according to patterns already laid down. When the sensitive and conscientious ward orderly reads, she reads French literature, because, she says: I know of no books closer to our life that wouldn't irritate me. Some of them take the readers for fools. Others tell no lies; our writers take great pride in that achievement. They conduct deep research into what country lane a great poet travelled along in the year eighteen hundred and something, or what lady he was referring to on page so- and-so. It may not have been an easy task working all that out, but it was safe, oh yes, it was safe. They chose the easy path! But they ignored those who are alive and suffering today.25 Kostoglotov has found her reading Claude Farrere, a writer distinguished for his exotic, sophisticated style and journalistic travelogues. Not first-rate literature by any means, but to Kosto- glotov's charge that it is a drug she replies with the words quoted above, and she has a point. She also has a point when she talks of Anna Karenina not being so very unhappy, and even that it is a waste of time reading about her. Her opinions are perfectly justified when set against the sterility of Soviet literature. If certain subject matter is taboo, certain norms obligatory, and happy endings inevit- able, then the net result means not only the castration of literature 69</page><page sequence="12">as a living, social force, but also invalidation of the literature of the past. The past is no good without the present. The point is driven home very well by the elderly ward orderly by her remark that it is allowed to write about the Siege of Leningrad but not about the 1935 purge of that city. "Where can people read about us? Us? only in a hundred years' time?" she asks.2^ literature has to deal with current events as well as universal topics if it is to be any good. Indeed only from current topics can it achieve a measure of univer- sality. In The First Circle and Cancer Ward Solzhenitsyn practises what he preaches - he deals with the recent past in its entirety. Yelizaveta Anatolyevna provides the concrete social justification for literature. Kostoglotov is not a literary man. He tries to persuade Dyoma to be an engineer and he teaches him stereometry. At the very begin- ing of the novel he says that education does not make you smarter. Yet he reads avidly and even persuades Yefrem to read seriously for the first time in his life. There are many things he does not under- stand - as he tells Zoya, he doesn't know who was responsible for the Siege of Leningrad. We have seen that his arguments with Rusanov are unsophisticated. With Shulubin he does a lot of listen- ing, confining himself to one or two questions and avoiding any theorizing. There is no real dialogue between the two. Yet with his plebeian outlook he often stimulates interesting thoughts and dis- cussions in others. There is an undefined empathy between him and many of the other characters. Here we would expect him to respond immediately to what Yelizaveta says about literature but he says nothing and goes in to see Shulubin. This transition is of vital importance. We know that Kostoglotov is the one man in the novel who is, more than all the others, guided entirely by his conscience, his moral self. We know too little of Yelizaveta to assess her morality; she is a passive victim, not a fighter, but her interest in literature must suggest, according to the Solzhenitsyn formula, a moral aware- ness, a conscience. Shulubin is bedevilled by his conscience; he is all moral awareness and no moral action. So Kostoglotov moves in- stinctively from a social justification for literature voiced by a person whose morality is never explored, to a person who is con- stantly searching his conscience and who supports all that he says mainly from philosophy, but occasionally from literature. Kostoglotov thus becomes the link between the social and the philosophical justification for literature. He himself never understands the link; his morality and his action are at one, and he never does any soul- searching because he never needs to. The knot is finally tied by what Shulubin says - a quotation from Pushkin and then a philosophical statement: 70</page><page sequence="13">Sometimes I feel quite distinctly that what is inside me is not all of me. There's something else, sublime, quite indestructible, some tiny fragment of the universal spirit. 27 Shulubin 's imagination has been caught by Solovyov, who in addition to arguing for a society based on ethics rather than economics or anything else, argues in the same book, The Justification of the Good, which Shulubin refers to in 'Idols of the market place', that God is within man: It is in religious experience that the reality of what is experienced, the real presence of God, is given . . . Correct theology, just like correct astronomy (!) is an important, essential business, but it is not of primary importance . . . The reality of deity is not a conclusion of religious experience, but is the content of this experience . . . God is within us, therefore He exists.28 The literary theme of Cancer Ward starts with Yefrem, a man without conscience who suddenly acquires it through literature. The awakening forces him to consider that a clear conscience could even provide a cure to his disease. He has been a wholly material, physical being, so a conscience could give him what he wants. Shulubin, all conscience, ideas and hot air, is at the eleventh hour captivated by a line of Pushkin, which sums up his philosophical background and brings him comfort. So literature can give man a conscience or it can moor his conscience to his life, if it has, as in Shulubin's case, gone adrift. In this sense Kostoglotov does not need literature since conscience and life are at one in him. But he reads, as he does everything, out of instinct and reinforces his moral self, his conscience. Literature can give any man what he wants; it concerns us all, young and old, the well-read and the un-educated. In his Nobel prize lecture, published in Stockholm in August 1972, Solzhenitsyn spells out the functions and responsibilities of art and literature: In this hour of alarm I think that world literature is capable of helping the human race to understand itself properly, in spite of what is being instilled into us by prejudiced people and groups. It can move concentrated experience from one country to another so that we are no longer dazzled, we no longer see double. It can bring together different scales of values so that nations learn briefly and accurately the history of other nations, and all the more intensely because by reading they absorb the pain of what happened, they all but experience it themselves. Thus they are protected from making the same mistakes later.29 The moral debate, firstly argued by Kostoglotov, Rusanov and Shulubin, and secondly related theoretically to literature through 71</page><page sequence="14">four other characters, gains further prominence by being carried from rather rarified generalisations down to the more immediate world of the everyday, of byt. This is done primarily by intro- ducing characters, usually of minor importance, who possess a certain moral ambivalence. Through these more minor characters we are confronted with more specific, everyday issues, on which the author does not reveal so much his own moral view as his belief that small moral issues are related to big moral generalisations, that what Kostoglotov or Rusanov stand for has direct consequences for those who do not concern themselves with the 'big' questions. The immediate result is to make the whole novel more relevant to us all - perhaps we have not all met an ex-convict or a high-ranking bureaucrat, but we have met a lazy menial worker, or a young girl with 'modern' ideas - but more importantly, it urges us to a greater moral awareness in everything we do. It is beside the point whether Solzhenitsyn personally disapproves in a given context of sex before marriage, or black-marketeering; the crux of the matter is really that the morality of such acts should be considered, not just the immed- iate material gains. His attitude to some of these characters is not so much censure as pity. Time and time again he tells us that life without self is nothing. Often people do others harm if they are unaware of this, but equally they can harm themselves. No matter how moral, immoral or amoral the characaters in Cancer Ward may be, they all take part in the moral debate or illustrate certain facets of it. To present a total picture Solzhenitsyn brings in one more character, who at first may appear superfluous. It is Vadim. His importance lies in the fact that he shows the positive qualities of the system, just as the understanding bureaucrat at the end does. Solzhenitsyn's own intellectual outlook does not allow him to reject a whole society, or society in general, out of hand. In his clear desire to rebarbarise the age, to go 'back to nature', there is a nagging doubt, an uncertainty factor. His search for a balance between the individual and society, between science and self, includes a whispered affirmation that the self can use society for its own ends, not the other way round; that no society can com- pletely obliterate self, that self versus society is a perpetual struggle which no side can ever win, and which gives life its meaning. "There are questions on which a definite opinion has been established, and they are no longer open to discussion," says Rusanov,30 and Solzhenitsyn retorts with a resounding 'No!'. The irony of life, the natural injustices of life, so richly portrayed in Cancer Ward, generate moral awareness and reassessment, and demand the correcting of man-made injustices. In this, the autonomy of literature, for all the questions it begs, must be guaranteed, and 72</page><page sequence="15">the integrity of literature must be preserved. The ironic strain in Cancer Ward found eloquent justification on 24 September 1973. On that day Solzhenitsyn's first wife, Natalya Reshetovskaya, rang him up, and arranged a meeting. In essence the authorities, through her, were offering to publish Cancer Ward legally on condi- tion that Solzhenitsyn delayed for 20 years the publication of Arkhipelag GULag (The Gulag Archipelago ), seized in August 1973.31 Cancer Ward was to become a bargaining counter in a political game. However, the authorities did not see that they were not dealing with a Chaly or even a Shulubin, but more than ever with a Kostoglotov. And ironically, Solzhenitsyn had by then lost any attachment he and Kostoglotov may have had for the notion expressed in the ancient Russian proverb which intrigues the hero of Cancer Ward so much:- "Soft words will break your bones".32 Notes 1.
