<plain_text><page sequence="1">In Defense of A1-Hallidj JAMES S. HELFER HISTORY, in the guise of the mihna in Baghdad during the seven months preceding the month of March, 922 A. D., judged and con- demned al-Hallidj as a heretic; and, with a few notable exceptions, Western scholars of Islam have concurred.' For the most part, however, such negative judgments have been predicated upon an inadequate analysis of al-Ijallidj's mystical theology and have tended to interpret his intention almost entirely in terms of his most radical identity-statements while failing to relate these utterances to the whole fabric of his theology. This herme- neutical fallacy, one frequently seen in the work of scholars whose primary concern is with the history of ideas,2 is particularly difficult to understand in light of the fact that categories of revelation in Islam have a central role which they have achieved in no other religion. In other words, to fail to relate al-H.allidj's most radical mystical utterances to those categories of revelation which not only underlie his mysticism but also make it possible is to fail to understand him. The purpose of this essay, then, is to clarify the relations between revelation and mysticism in the theology of al-H.allddj in an attempt to come to a more adequate understanding of his intention as a Ailfi and also to demonstrate that there is nothing inherently heretical in his theology. It is perhaps commonplace to mention that in its inception, Islim was the most perfect example of transcendental monotheism known in the history of religions: it affirmed without qualification that Allah was one. This affir- mation of the unicity of AllIh, which is the quintessence of Islamic revelation, is the non-rational given upon which the experience of isldm (submission) is grounded and with which orthodox Sufism must remain consistent. This JAMES S. HELFER is presently Assistant Professor of Religion at Wesleyan University. 1 For a brief note on some of the Muslim and Western opinions on the "heresy" of al-HIalli~dj, see Shorter Encyclopedia of Islam, ed. H. A. R. Gibb and J. H. Kramers, Leiden: Brill, 1953, pp. 127-8. 2 Unfortunately, most students of "comparative mysticism" seem to have a tendency for this aberrant method of interpretation. 138</page><page sequence="2">IN DEFENSE OF AL--HALLADJ 139 canon of Islamic belief is implied at many points in the Kur'in itself, but nowhere is it more perfectly expressed than in the shahdda or confession of faith.' In the shahida, the affirmation of Allah's unicity constitutes the first part of the basic creed to which all orthodox Muslims give assent; and it is in relation to the shahdda that al-HIall~dj's mystical theology must be under- stood and interpreted. He differs greatly from most other famous sifis in the sense that although his language and radical identity-statements appear to involve an awareness of his existential union with Allah, his constant and self-conscious relating of his experience to the revealed unicity of the deity provides a dynamic deterrent to his being guilty of shirk, of associating another entity with Allah. The major difficulty in understanding al-H;Iallidj correctly is seen in the manner in which his interpreters have placed him in the same class as other sifis who have in fact claimed total union with Allah without clarifying the relations between their claim to this transcendental experience and their belief in the revealed unicity of the deity. Thus, al-Bistmni of Balkh cries: "Praise be to Me!" Ibn Sahl al-Tustari claims, "I am the proof of Allah!" And ibn Abi'l Khair insists, "Beneath my robe there is only God!" Each of these mystics tends to interpret and understand his experience in either pan- theistic or monistic terms; and although al-Hjallidj is said to have claimed to have been al-IHakk (the Creative Truth), he does not fall into the error of identifying himself with Allah, nor does he identify any created entity in such fashion. The notion of claiming divinity for himself would have been repugnant to him as well as clearly heretical; and the claims made above were understood to involve precisely such an affirmation of existential union with the deity. Al-H.all'dj differs from others of the .sifis in that his inten- tionality is centered, not upon himself in relation to the deity, but entirely upon the deity revealed in the Iur'Jn and affirmed in the shahada. Yet merely to assert that al-I;Iallddj's mystical consciousness was established by his exis- tential appropriation of Allah as attested in these ways, by his interiorization of the full meaning of "knowing" the one true God, is hardly adequate evi- dence for the validity of the claim and is also insufficient evidence to verify his orthodoxy. It is necessary to determine precisely how al-HIallddj under- stood his mystical experience in relation to the shahdda. Parenthetically, the function of the Kur'in as the source of all knowledge of Allah may also be made clear. a The first half of the shahida, with which I am solely concerned, is: La iliha illa illahu "There is no god but Allih."</page><page sequence="3">140 JAMES S. HELFER THE NATURE OF REVELATION IN AL-HALLADJ'S MYSTICISM "Le Qorin exprime toute science. Et le Qoran s'exprime dans les con- sonnes mises en composition. Celles-ci proviennent de 1' 'Alphabet 6quatorial', dont le fondement est fixe mais dont les derivations sont c6lestes. Et c'est autour d'elle que gravite la Proclamation de l'Unite (divine)."4 Quite obvi- ously, for al-H.alladi the Kur'dn is the very basis upon which valid knowledge of the divine unity is predicated. He does not fall into the error of maintaining that the very letter and language of the scripture is divine and uncreated as have many Muslim theologians, nor does he attempt to reduce it to mere metaphor. He insists that although the specific script used in the composition of the text arises in a certain historical context, its meaning is derived not from that context nor from any single interpretation of the text, but only from the total appropriation into the individual's consciousness of the divine meaning that gives authority and sacred potency to the text.5 In other words, only if the .ur'an is experienced as the vehicle of Allah's self-revelation can it be said to contain all knowledge concerning divine reality. Since the shahada is grounded in the KIur'in and contains the essence of kuranic revelation, ultimately the meaning of the Kur'dn and the validity of one's mystical knowl- edge of the deity rest in the total, experiential appropriation of the shahida. It is the experiential interiorization of the shahdda that constitutes the unio mystica for al-HIallidj. In order fully to understand the nature and meaning of the divine unity, one must attain taqawvwuf, perfect union with the divine will.6 Prior to this attainment, however, one must grasp the meaning of the shahida and recognize that its only true source lies in the creative power of Allah. "A Dieu seul appartient de proclamer Son Unite; et seul, I'Envoy6 de Dieu, connait le vrai sens de la Proclamation de I'Unit6."7 It is in light of this understanding of the source of the affirmation of divine unity that al-Hall-idj refuses to acknowledge the capacity of man to affirm that unity. Allah alone can affirm his unity; and any human attempt to do so must result in equivocation and meaninglessness. "La Proclamation de l'Unit6 est trop en dehors du langage pour qu'elle puisse etre exprimee."' Human language 4 Husayn ibn Mansur Hallaj, Akhbar al-Hallaj, ed. and trans. L. Massignon and P.

Man's expressing the shahada, then, as long as he believes that he is proclaiming the deity's nature, is always but an approximation and equivocation that succeeds only in being heretical. Man can neither ask nor answer the question of Allah's unity as it is expressed in the shahdda; both the question and the answer are Allah's alone. According to al-HEallddj, the true Muslim has no choice but to submit and confess the inviolability of the statement that "I'1 n'y a point de divinit6 except6 Dieu."' Beyond this, any attempt to affirm the unity of Allah would involve one in the heresy of shirk. "Sache que l'homme qui proclame l'unit6 de Dieu s'affirme lui-meme. Or, s'affirmer soi-meme, c'est s'associer implic- itement ' Dieu. En realit6, c'est Dieu lui-meme qui proclame Son Unit6 par la bouche de qui il veut d'entre Ses creatures. S'il tient ' affirmer Son Unit6 par ma bouche, cela La regarde. Sinon, qu'ai-je a faire avec la Proclamation de l'Unit6!"'o For the human individual to dare to affirm Allah's tawhid (in any sense)" would be to claim implicitly that his own mode of existence is at least analogous to that of the deity. Al-Halljdj denies that this is an existential possibility and asserts unconditionally that if any man justly claims to affirm Allah, it is Allah's self-affirmation. The human creature is merely a tool of divine omnipotence and self-revelation. However, al-H.allidj is not content merely to affirm Allah's transcen- dence and the truth that the nature of Allah's essence is contrary to that of his creatures.'2 He also places Allah utterly beyond conceptualization. "En effet, comment concevoir une analogie possible entre l'6ternel et le cr66? Quant celui qui croit que le Createur Se trouve en tel lieu, ou est lie a un lieu quelconque ou qu'I1l puisse &amp;tre conqu dans la conscience, apparaitre dans l'imagination ou rentrer sous attribut ou qualification, il fait oeuvre d'associateur."'3 Allah's self-proclamation of unity reveals a being who is transcendent of all relationships, one of whom all possible predicates are equivocal. Any attempt on man's part to conceive of the deity necessarily re- sults in his transforming Allah into a creature of his own symbolic conceptual processes.

HELFER However, in spite of the fact that al-Hjalladj states the essential dichotomy between the creator and the created in the most radical way, and in spite of the fact that the shahdda is ultimately as irrelevant as any scriptural or the- ological statement purporting to conceptualize Allih,15 the shahida yet retains a unique place in his mysticism. Despite the fact that like any other creedal confession this one was potentially pernicious,15 it is clear that for al-.Halladj the shahdda becomes the foundation of the via mystica that culminates in ta;awvwuf. For him the true meaning of the shahtda is to discern "la tem- poralit6 d'avec la perennit6, puis s'6carter de l'une pour aller vers l'autre. Telle est la d6finition brute de la Proclamation de l'Unit6. En ce qui concerne sa d6finition nette, elle consiste a s'aneantir dans la perennit6 hors de la tem- poralite."16 This interiorization of the shahdda is not within the power of man to accomplish; it lies solely within the power of Allih. Only divine power can enable man to appropriate the shahdda fully,17 and this invasion of the soul results in the total transformation of the individual: his selfhood is annihilated. Thus, the precise definition or meaning of the shahdda has nothing to do with conceptual definitions; it is a state of the soul in which there is no opposition between the divine will and the human will. The shahdda, therefore, is known fully only in so far as it is the ground for a divinely caused act of self-abnegation; it is understood to contain a tran- scendental, non-rational truth that cannot be conceptually limited, that can only be experienced as a state of the soul attained "a Lui, de Lui, en Lui, et pour Lui."'8 Ultimately, the shahida refers alone to a state of mystical aware- ness which is attained only in total submission to the will of Allah. It can only be "understood" subsequent to that attainment. Although for al-Ijallidj revelation begins with the IXur'dn, out of which arises the shahida or proclamation of divine unity, ultimately revelation can only be an experience. In other words, the proof of the existence and unity of Allah is not to be found in the Kur'in or in the person of the prophet, nor 16 J. Marechal, Studies in the Psychology of the Mystic, London: Macmillan, 1927, p. 257: "Hallaj prohibited his disciples from 'wasting their time' in reciting or meditating super- stitiously on the shahadah . .. a formula imperfect in itself which God alone, by his en- lightening grace, could make us utter ... by leading us to be conscious of the mystery of his unity, in the very operation of his action; by making us first of all deny ourself in our heart, so as afterwards to affirm him-self therein by his presence." Cf., Massignon, op. cit., pp. 787-8: "Al-Hallaj condamne l'illusion criminelle de certains qui s'imaginent en recitant la shahadah, t6moigner reellement que Dieu est unique." 16 Akhbar al-Hallaj, op. cit., p. 143, No. 63. 17 Cf., Massignon, op. cit., pp. 785 ff. 18 Le Di'wvn d'al-Hallj, essai de reconstitution, ed. and trans.

"La preuve est ' Lui, de Lui, vers Lui, en Lui, le T6moin meme de R6el dans une r6v6lation se formulant. Le preuve est ' Lui, de Lui, en Lui, et pour Lui; en verit6, c'est Lui que nous y avons trouv6, comme une science en sa d6monstration. Qu'on ne d6duise plus le Createur de Son oeuvre cr66, vous tous, etres contingents, etes devies de Lui de toute la fissure des temps. C'est la mon existence, ma confession, et ma conviction, c'est la l'unification (divine) de ma profession de foi et de ma croyance."'9 Only the total appropriation of the shahdda can serve as a valid means to experience of the revealed god; the mystical experience of conformation with the will of Allah is the sole verification of his omnipresence in the created order and the vindication of his claim to unity. Prior to this experience, there was no way in which al-HI allidj could validly claim to be a muslim (one who sub- mits). Having become conformed to the will of Allah, having become one of the shawdhid,20 al-Ijallddj found the true meaning of the Kur'dn and the shahdda revealed to him. As al-Ijall~dj indicates, however, his experience is his neither to enjoy nor to possess; it is the pleasure and possession of the ravisher of his soul, Allah.21 The individual does not express divine reality; he is an expression of that reality. "Je suis une m6taphore (tajawoz), non un apparentement generique (tajanos), une apparition (zohour), non une infusion (holoul) dans un receptacle materiel (haykal jothmani). Ma surgie (actuelle) n'est pas un (simple) retour a la pr66ternit6; c'est une realite imperceptible aux sens et hors de l'atteinte des analogies."22 This important passage makes it clear that the experience of taawwvuf and the realization of the tawhid of Allah in no way entail a claim upon the part of al-HIalladj that he has attained union with the deity. In the state of ta;awwuf the mystic does not fulfill his original potentiality, nor is any generic relationship shown to obtain between creator and creature. The relationship is not one in which the riih nitika (uncreated divine spirit) replaces the created riTh (spirit) of the mystic. Al-I.allddj claims to be but a metaphor or an image of the divine, an appearance; he has become a manifestation of Allah's kon or creative power.23 There is no par- ticular gnosis involved in al-IIallddj's experience; he is totally helpless to contribute or detract from the attainment or non-attainment of taoawwuf. The soul's operation is annihilated by the omnipotence of the deity-in-act; 19 Ibid., p. 29. 20 Cf. note 6 above. 21 Massignon, op. cit., p. 524. 22 Ibid., pp. 520-21. 23 Suggestively translated by Massignon as "'Timpulsion creatrice."</page><page sequence="7">144 JAMES S. HELFER and the created order and the individual burn and are consumed by the burning desire and dynamic passion of Allah.24 Only then is Allah revealed; and only then can al-Hallidj know the nature of the relation between Allah and the created order. THE NATURE OF ALLXH IN AL-HJALLADJ'S MYSTICISM The following discussion of the nature of the "object" of al-Hallddj's experience consists of brief analyses of two quite different kinds of utterances concerning Allah. The first is concerned with an explication of his most complete "doctrine" of Allah; the second with his understanding of his relation to Allah in ta.sawwuf. 11 a lie le tout ' la contingence, car la transcendance est " Lui ... Mais Lui, Los ' Lui! qu'll soit exalt6, il ne saurait y avoir d'au-dessus qui Le surplombe, ni d'au-dessous qui Lui diminue, ni de limite qui L'affronte, ni d'aupres qui Le gene, ni d'en arriere qui Le blame, ni d'en avant qui Le limite, ni d'auparavant qui Le fasse apparafire, ni d'apres qui Le fasse evanouir, ni de tout qui Le concentre, ni d'il est qui Le fasse trouver, ni d'il n'est pas qui en prive. Pour Le decrire, il n'existe pas d'attribut, Son acte n'a pas de cause, Son &amp;tre n'a pas de borne. 11 se tient 6loign6 (tanazzaha) des 6tats de sa creation, I1 n'y a pas en Lui de melange (imtizaj) avec sa creation, Son acte n'admet pas d'amendement, 11 s'est 6cart6 d'eux en Sa transcendance, comme eux s'ecartent de Lui en Leur contingence ... Son exis- tence est Son affirmation (ithbat) meme (qu'il existe), Sa sagesse est Son attestation (a Lui-meme) qu'I1 est unique (ma'rifatoho tavwahidoho), et cette sienne attestation de Son unite est Sa distinction (tamyizoho) d'avec sa creation... 11 contredit tout cela, comment penetrerait (yahill) en Lui cela qu'll a fait croltre. 11 ne saurait y avoir d'yeux qui se Le figurent, ni de pens6es qui L'affrontent.

"Il est le Premier et le Dernier, le Patent, le Cache, le Proche, 1'Eloign6, Lui ' qui aucune chose ne ressemble Lui, I'Audient, le Voyant."25 With perhaps the exception of chapter ten of the Bhagavadgitd, I know of no better statement of the otherness of transcendent deity than this. Allah is the prototype of "the Wholly Other" and "the Holy Other." He is totally beyond all relations with the created order, beyond all limitations and condi- tions upon his essential being. His existence is proved by his self-affirmation in the shahdda and ta.sawwuf; his wisdom is contained wholly in his self- proclamation of his unity; his nearness is his presence; his disdainful detach- ment from the realm of creaturely existence is his expression of power and lordliness; he is the first and the last, the manifest and the hidden, the near and the distant, the unique and the omniscient. Above all, however, he is 4 Me'langes Mare'chal, Musee Lessianum - Section Philosophique No. 32, Bruxelles: L'Edition Universelle, S.

"La sagesse (hikma), disait Hallaj, ce sont fl&amp;ches aux cibles des coeurs croyants; dont Dieu est I'Archer infaillible."27 Allah is, then, the never failing seeker of souls in the face of whose power none can stand. He is the ravisher of the creation whose nature is 'ishk dhati, the deity self-revealed in the mystic's experience of the essential meaning of the shahada to whom al-Ijall~dj is compelled to cry: "Je Te d6sire; je ne Te d6sire pas pour la liesse (des Ilus), non, mais je Te d6sire pour ma damnation."28 No utterance in the entire corpus of al-H.allidj's work illustrates more perfectly his understanding of the relation between Allah and himself, that obtains as a result of tasawwuf. Not out of joy, but with utter humility does he desire Allah, thus illustrating the total lack of power and value that constitutes the subjective element of what Otto has termed the "tremendum moment" of the numinous experience. "I desire you for my [own] damnation." This is not the cry of one who considers himself divine or even an analogue of divinity as a consequence of his mystical experience. It is the cry of one who protests the experience (over which he has no control), of one who is totally aware of the consequences of desiring that which is itself essential desire. In brief, al- HIallddj's awareness of Allah and the experience of taawrwuf, while it is undoubtedly understood to be the highest form of creaturely experience, leads not to the paradise of the Elect, but to eternal damnation, if Allah so wills. The conclusion of this brief analysis of the two kinds of statements which reflect al-Hallidj's experience of Allah must be to deny the baseless charges that he is a monist or an incarnationalist and to affirm once again the obvious fact that his view of language and his understanding of createdness alone suffice to rule out his being guilty of shirk or of associating another entity with the transcendent god. The creation, unnecessary to Allah, is bound in its contingency to his will; and in attempting to clarify the relation between them, al-Hjallddj makes it clear that man must operate with wholly inadequate symbols that are, by definition, limited to the contingent realm and fail to penetrate to Allah. 26 Milanges Marichal, op. cit., Vol. II, p. 290. 27 Ibid., p. 295 (italics mine). 2s Le Dilv5n d'al-,Iallij, op. cit., p. 43. Cf. the following utterance from Rabi'a (d. 801): "If I worship thee from fear of Hell, burn me in Hell; and if I worship thee from hope of Paradise, exclude me thence; but if I worship thee for thine own sake, then withhold not from me Thine Eternal Beauty."</page><page sequence="9">146 JAMES S. HELFER However, problems yet remain (within the limited scope of this essay), and can be resolved only by relating these conclusions to some of al-Hallidj's most radical identity-statements. Although it is clear that, in theory at least, he denied the possibility of the creature's becoming transcendent, the language of his identity-statements appears to confute this conclusion. IDENTITY-STATEMENTS IN AL-HIALLXDJ'S MYSTICISM The following identity-statement is the most infamous and the most fa- mous ever uttered by al-HIallddj. It is infamous because it is reputed to have been an issue in his condemnation before the mihna or inquisition in Baghdad in March, 922 A. D.; it is justly famous as one of the most radical claims made by a Sfi to (apparent) existential union with, and transformation into, Allah. "Je suis Verit6 - et la verit6 est propre 'a Dieu - revt&amp;ue de Son essence."29 This claim, an obvious identification of himself with al-IHakk (Reality or Truth),30 is not only left unqualified in the sense that al-H;Iallddj fails to specify its meaning in relation to his doctrine of Allah; it is also reinforced in the direction of heterodoxy in that he does point out that al-HIakk is the proper possession of Allah alone and yet that he is endowed with, or clad in, the essence of deity. It is quite understandable that this statement has been inter- preted as indicative of either monistic tendencies in al-H;Ialladj's mysticism or of an alien, incarnational element resulting from his being a "crypto- Christian." Here is undoubtedly one of the more radical Aifi utterances, but in the light of the above analysis of al-Hallddj's concept of deity and of his understanding of the relationship between creator and creation, it becomes obvious that a claim other than outright identification of himself with Allah is intended. Al-HallIdj's intention is to deny that there is any opposition between himself and Allah, to affirm that his submission (islim) is total and transform- ing (although he refuses to judge whether this transforming experience will result in salvation or damnation). At this point one must avoid the tendency that constantly threatens the student of mysticism to abstract radical identity- statements such as this from the context to which they belong. As I have noted elsewhere in the case of Rimanuja,31 aham brahma asmi is apparently 29 Akhbar al-Hallaj, op. cit., p. 149, No. 74. 30 Instead of being a radical innovation, however, as one might suppose, the use of this term for Allah apparently originated with the prophet himself; see Shorter Encyclopedia of Islam, op. cit., p. 36. "1 J. S. Heilfer, "The Body of Brahman According to Raminuja," The Journal of Bible and Religion, XXXII, 1 (January, 1964), pp. 43-6.</page><page sequence="10">IN DEFENSE OF AL-I.ALLADJ 147 an outright claim to identity with Brahman until it is realized that this is a valid statement concerning the existential state of the dtman only in so far as it is a mode of prakara of Brahman. As the following discussion of the nature of the natural order indicates, al-Halladj is making a similar claim for himself and all entities within the created order. In his claim to be al-Hakkk, then, he asserts that he is an expression of Allah's power, a metaphor or image of "deity-in-act," in contrast to his autonomous action or power. In brief, the transforming experience of tasawwuf results in the mystic's being incapable of having any object other than "Allah-in-act" for his inten- tionality. For one who has undergone such a transforming experience, all entities are equally expressions of "Allah-in-act." In other words, the only possible referent for al-HIalladj's mystical utterances is to be found in the created order; and any attempt on the part of any individual to refer beyond the created order must be understood as a mere concatenation of verbal sym- bols that are at best confessional and at worst damning. Therefore, if one places this kind of statement in the context of al-H;.alladj's theory of language and relates it to his doctrine of Allah, there is little choice but to conclude that his "identity-statements" have a purpose other than that of claiming to be Allah. The ~'ifi, according to al-H.alladj, fulfills his created function only if he attests with his every act to the unity and omnipotence of the deity. This is possible only if he stands in the one possible mode of being for the creature, only if, in submitting all to Allah, he becomes an expression of the deity's absolute power and value. In other words, al-Halladj, when conscious of the presence of Allah, a presence that is totally self-authenticating and does not necessarily involve the joys of paradise, denies the presence of all but "deity-in-act." The shahada (in the experiential, i. e., valid, sense) reveals a deity so utterly transcendent and unique that in his presence all else disap- pears; there is no other. The experience of taSawwuf, therefore, necessarily entails the annihilation of all intelligibility in the created order that is not theocentric. As al-Halladj indicates, where Allah is, nothing is.32 In turning, finally, to a brief analysis of the nature of the world in relation to Allah in al-IHalladj's mysticism, one finds that categories of value suddenly assume a central place that they did not have heretofore. Al-Hialladj con- sistently refers to the created order as "le bas monde" and categorically re- fuses to view it as anything but wholly contingent upon its creator. The created order is, however, disparaged and denigrated only in relation to Alldh. 82 Akhbar al-Hallaj, op. cit., p. 152, No. 12.</page><page sequence="11">148 JAMES S. HELFER It has value only in so far as it serves as an expression of Allih's kon or cre- ative will; and ta.sawuf is possible only for "ceux-la seuls pour qui tout ce bas monde ne vaut plus qu'un sou."33 However, as the activistic career of al-H.allidj demonstrates, and in spite of the fact that he maintained that "le caractere propre au vrai mystique est d'etre quitte de ce monde et de l'autre,"''34 he intended not that the ~iifi should utterly deny the world, but that in all his relations to the world he should experience it as a manifestation and expres- sion of Allih. "Quiconque observe ses oeuvres est priv6 de vision de l'Objet de ses oeuvres. Et quiconque observe l'Objet de ses oeuvres, est priv6 de la vision des oeuvres."3' It is clear that al-H.allddj neither denies the existence of the world nor affirms that it is divine in se. He merely attests that it is not possible to "know" or "see" the intentional referent of one's act if one is involved with those acts as ends in themselves or if they have an intentional referent other than Allah. By contrast, if one's intentionality is directed solely to Allah, the acts themselves "disappear," i. e., lose their autonomous intel- ligibility, in the sense that they are transformed into expressions of "deity-in- act." Therefore, in spite of the fact that Allah is that deity "qui apparais de tout c6tis, mais ne d6pends d'aucun c6t6,"36 when he, having constituted the mystic's intentionality anew in the ravishing experience of tayawwuf, is mani- fest, it can only be he that is present to the single eye of the mystic. ** Le Diwwn d'al-Iallaj, op. cit., p. 21. 34 Akhbar al-Hallaj, op. cit., p. 151, No. 5. 36 Ibid., p. 152, No. 12. 3' Ibid., p. 103, No. 1.</page></plain_text>
