<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOB AND FAUST: THE ETERNAL WAGER Charlotte Spivack Although the Faust myth assumed many forms after its origin in the early Renaissance, Goethe was the first—and so far as I know, the last—to incorporate in it the myth of Job. The reader naturally asks why. What connection did Goethe find between the subject of his epic poem and the Biblical account of a pious man's conflict with an autocratic god? Certainly Goethe's benevolent Lord is anything but autocratic, and his rebellious hero is anything but pious. Was it perhaps the common presence in the two narratives of a wager? In the Prologue to the Old Testament book of Job, Jehovah accepts a wager with Satan as to the fidelity of his worshipper Job under trial and torture. In Faust there are in fact two wagers. First, in the Prologue, the Lord accepts a wager serenely permitting the devil to goad Faust but makes it clear to the angels that there is no doubt in his mind of Faust's ability to triumph over either blandishment or adversity. Secondly, Faust himself accepts a wager with Mephistopheles in which he agrees to surrender his soul if he ever yields to a moment of contentment. The only point in common between both wagers in Faust and the one in Job is the identity of one participant, the devil. Was it per haps the figure of the devil who connected these two studies in Goethe's mind? Since a clarification of the Prologue in Heaven will add a dimension to our understanding of the entire poem of Faust, I believe that it is important to ascertain Goethe's inten tion in exploiting the Job myth. I think that the key to his purpose lies in his theory of "recurrent reflections" in lit 53</page><page sequence="2">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW erature. Goethe was an avid student of optics, fascinated with all aspects of seeing, and he borrowed the phrase "re current reflections" from the relatively new subject of en toptics.1 Whereas the science of optics is concerned with the visual perception of images external to the eye, that of en toptics involves the kind of perception dependent on the eye itself, and not on anything external to it. The fact that the lens of the eye is indeed able to see images of the interior of the eye has of course now become a recognized medical fact and is easily demonstrable through trained manipula tion of the eye.2 On the other hand, an extended application of the theory concerning the ability of the lens to retain re flections of a reality no longer matched by external phe nomena still remains very much in the realm of speculation. The implications of this idea interested Goethe very much. He was drawn to the possibility that the eye retains, in what I might anachronistically call a photographic way, images of the past analagous to those retained in a different manner by the memory. Furthermore, he applied the idea to lit erature. He suggested that literature was a lens capable of keeping the past alive through what he called recurrent reflections and what would probably today be called mythic patterns. He believed that these recurrent reflections elevate certain universally repeated experiences to a higher level of meaning. He applied the phrase specifically to one of his own favorite literary devices, that of the inset pattern wherein j an episode or a sequence or a character is set within an| analogous but larger framework for the sake of mirroring! the meaning. Goethe thus believed that recurring images^ of human experience achieve permanent reality in two different mirrors, the interior of the eye which has caught and retained their reflection, and the inset images of lit erature which record these reflections.

In reading Faust, it is easy to note several examples of such reflections. One striking example occurs in Part II, where Homunculus, the alchemical creation of Faust's pro tégé Wagner, reflects in his own brief career the long life of the protagonist. Although the Homunculus episode is not my main concern here, it will serve as a useful illustration since it can be discussed independently of the complex con text of the poem. Homunculus—the little man who is pro duced scientifically in a bottle—is an artificial creature in an artificial environment, a parody of Faust, the protagonist who first appears as a lonely academic, cloistered in his hermetic study. This little creature has the spirit of man without the flesh; he is a disembodied flame shining in his little glass world. Recognizing quickly what Faust takes long to learn, that is, that life needs embodiment, he sets out in search of a body. Faust, in the one-sided intellectualism so apparent at the beginning, has neglected and suppressed his sensual nature, and his profound melancholy in the open ing scene betrays a man who has lost touch with the springs of physical vitality through an exaggerated devotion to study. Homunculus, as a product of the mind, a mere spark of intellect, reflects Faust in his search for mythic meaning, for wholeness, a search which ultimately takes him back to the sea, as the source of life. The Homunculus story is but one example of the many recurrent reflections in Faust. Another instance of this inset pattern is offered in the multiple beginnings of the poem, which is launched with both a Prelude and a Prologue. The Prelude in the Theater offers a fairly obvious mirror of the three major figures, with the Lord envisioned as the stage manager, Faust as the unhappy poet, and Mephistopheles as the cynically jesting comedian. Perhaps, then, viewing the Prologue in Heaven from this same point of view—as a reflection of the same universal experience which occurs in 55</page><page sequence="4">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW the main body of the poem—will yield an answer to the question of why Goethe chose this particular traditional story for his beginning. In what follows, therefore, I intend to analyze first Job, then Faust, from the viewpoint of certain ideas and images which occur in both. Central to both works is the conflict with the adversary, Satan, and in each case the conflict is initiated through the poetic device of a wager. In each work the reader reaches a new awareness of the nature of man, based on the ever-recurring wager with the devil. My starting point will be the pregnant remark of Goethe's that "all outer things are also inner things."3 II Historically, the psychological history of the West has been characterized by a great movement of internalization: what were once regarded as the outer things have come to be viewed as the inner things. Centuries ago, for example, a man's genius was thought to be a separate demon, an at tendant allotted to each human being as a kind of corporal but invisible guide through life. Gradually, through a series of slow steps over a long period of time, genius came to mean a cast of mind, an inward quality of self, a highly per sonal talent. The movement from external forces to inner psychic phenomena is characteristic of this general move ment toward subjectivity. C. S. Lewis has commented on the shift in a tone of nostalgic lament, "Always, century by cen tury, item after item is transferred from the object's side of the account to the subject's." And, he adds wryly, "Now . . . the subject himself is discounted as merely subjective; we only think that we think. Having eaten up everything else, he eats himself up too. And where we go from that is a dark question."4 Perhaps Goethe foresaw this absurd dead end of subjectivity and mocked it through the words of the brash young graduate in Part II of Faust, who boasts that the world is an extension of his own ego: 3 Cit. C. G. Jung, Psychological Reflections, trans. Jacobi (1953), p. * C. S. Lewis, The Discarded Image (1964), p. 215. 56</page><page sequence="5">JOB AND FAUST The world was not until I made it whole; I raised the sun from ocean where it lay; For me the moon began her changeful way; The way stood forth in beauty at my feet, The green earth blossomed my approach to greet. A sign from me, and in that primal night The stars unveiled the splendor of their light, (p. 98)® As well as a mockery of the subjective school of philosophy at that time, represented by Fichte and others, this ego maniacal boast is an echo, if not a parody, of the voice from the whirlwind which subdued Job. One major dimension of this steady historical shift, throughout the cultural history of the western world, from objectification to subj edification, is the evolution in con cepts of deity. God and the devil have gradually undergone the transformation from external-anthropomorphic (or bes tial) beings to inward forces, psychic or spiritual. The his torical advent of Christianity exemplifies the trend, moving from myth to religion, from the vengeful, thundering Je hovah of the Old Testament—essentially a Zeus figure—a nature god who administered thunderbolts arbitrarily—to the New Testament concept of the Trinity, which incar nated the son of God as man and located the holy spirit of God within all men. Certain works of literature offer mythic statements of sig nificant moments in this evolution of deity, either historical or psychological or both. In these literary moments of his torical or psychological awakening the prevailing concept of deity is questioned or challenged and a new concept emerges or superimposes itself on the old. Both the Biblical book of Job and Goethe's Faust are concerned with a leap from the notion of an objectified deity toward that of a god within, and in both Job and Faust the individual religious experi ence produces an expanded consciousness of selfhood. Both Job and Faust confront deity only to find themselves coming 5 My citations from Goethe's Faust are from the English translation by Philip Wayne (Part I, 1949; Part II, 1959). 5 7</page><page sequence="6">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW to grips with an archetypal deity in the subconscious.® In Goethe's words, both Job and Faust discover that "the outer things are also inner things." In this sense both heroes un dergo a paradigm of a religious experience and at the heart of this experience is a symbolic wager with the devil. Per haps in this parallel mythic pattern lies the reason for Goethe's inclusion of the Job story within his epic poem. In order to explore and explain this rather general state ment of a parallel pattern, I shall now turn to a closer look at first Job, then Faust. My argument will follow a Jungian approach—my concern with the nature of deity is primarily psychological, not theological—and I am particularly in debted to Jung's provocative Answer to Job. Ill The powerfully written poetic book of Job, perhaps pro duced as early as the sixth century B. C., epitomizes a thought emerging in human consciousness at about that stage of its history. Job, alone on his pile of shards and listening to the voice speaking through the whirlwind, embodies a significant advance in the progressively inward evolution of deity. As has been pointed out in a recent study of Satan, both Job and Jehovah are transformed through the experi ence of the wager. In the words of the Biblical scholar Riv kah Kluger, "Yahweh has revealed himself to Job as an am bivalent divine personality, and Job ... has been transformed into one who accepts not only the good God but also the dark one."7 In the Prologue, Job is identified as a virtuous man. What this means is that apparently he has been fulfilling the j standards of piety valid at that time. These standards are implicit in the specific references to Job's "good" behavior. He has made sacrifices regularly; he has performed the pre o Throughout my discussion, 1 am assuming the point of view expressed by C. G. Jung, i.e., that the God-image coincides with an archetype of the Self in the unconscious. f See Rivkah Kluger, Satan in the Old Testament (1967). 58</page><page sequence="7">JOB AND FAUST scribed rituals. From the Lord's point o£ view, "virtue" is a formality, a ritualistic conformity. In the Prologue, however, we learn even more about the figures of Jehovah and Satan than we do about the human protagonist. As for Jehovah, he seems preoccupied with pride over his servant Job, the "perfect and upright man," and mentions him in conversation with Satan. Of Satan we note first that he is one of the "sons" of Jehovah. Although the literal meaning of the word might be debated, even if it is considered metaphorically, it is clear, as Jung points out, that Satan is an off-shoot, a dimension of Jehovah. We learn that Satan has been going up and down on the earth, but his only action in the prologue is to plant a doubt in the Lord's mind about the loyalty of his worshipper Job. What he suggests is that Job's loyalty is really a matter of self interest. Job has been loyal because he profited from being so. Like the semi-comic figure of "little devil doubt" in an old mummers' play, Satan represents a "doubting thought" (Jung's phrase) in the mind of Jehovah. The wager that ensues is a concession to that doubt. In the central, dramatic section of the book, the scene focuses on Job himself, first in dialogue with his comforters, then in direct confrontation with the voice of the Lord, who has singled him out for chastisement. Job's state of mind initially is that of mingled pessimism and skepticism. The "pious" Job of orthodox tradition is largely limited to the frame story, for as Richard Sewall remarked in his discussion of Job as tragedy, the poetic account within the folk tale framework is a "dangerous" book. In language that ap he laments his life, to his very birth, even the moment of his conception. It is also worth noting that Job's account of his proaches what later Christianity would have called despair, own virtuous behavior is rather different from that described in the prologue, where he is praised for burnt offerings. Here he includes such actions as giving to the poor. The burden of the first few chapters, however, is that of questioning. Job 59</page><page sequence="8">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW questions the nature of man, the nature of God, and the nature of their relationship. As for man, Job asks: What is man that thou shouldst magnify him? And that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him? And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, And try him every moment? Referring specifically to himself, he then asks: Why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, So that I am a burden to myself? Job's questions about the nature of God, on the other hand, focus on his mystery: Wherefore hidest thou thy face, And holdest me for thine enemy? Oh that I knew where I might find him I That I might come even to his seat! Both questions—those regarding men and those regarding Jehovah—culminate in the question of relationship: Job has assumed that in the past he has been rewarded by a just god for his virtuous behavior. The easy formula of virtue re warded by a just god must be challenged: Wherefore do the wicked live, Become old, yea, are mighty in power? And the questions modulate into answers: I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not. Thou art become cruel to me: With thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me. Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, And dissolvest my substance. Job's assumptions about Jehovah are shaken. When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: And when I waited for light, there came darkness. The reason and justice that he had expected from the Lord seem to exist only in his own mind. 60</page><page sequence="9">JOB AND FAUST The answer that he finally receives from the voice in the whirlwind does not negate but rather confirms the dawning realization that the Lord brings darkness as well as light. The voice which speaks to Job is essentially that of a nature god, a primeval force in the universe, amoral by definition. The deity which is manifested in the whirlwind has created the leviathan and the behemoth, monsters on land and sea; it has not created a just universe. It has created mountains, not morality; thunder, not theology. In the moving final scene of the drama Job has come to realize that he cannot argue with a force of nature. But he has gained something from the experience brought about by the wager. Although he is nothing compared to a bolt of lightning or a behemoth, he is now morally elevated above and beyond the god which he thought he worshipped. Now Job is aware that the god in nature is dark as well as light, and evil as well as good, hence neither good nor evil, but something much greater: a total ity encompassing all. He prostrates himself before this mas sive but sublime force of nature: I know that thou canst do everything. Job's words are both a worshipful compliment and a moral condemnation. In the epilogue which follows, Satan does not return. It is not necessary for the son of god to return because it is now clear to Job that Satan is a part of the god whom he wor ships. Only Job realizes this, for his comforters persist in the anthropomorphic fallacy that their god is just and ra tional in his administration of rewards and punishments. But it is they whom Jehovah most emphatically rebukes. They "have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has." Satan is, however, the spiritual agent of two changes which take place in the book of Job. Satan's influence has a healthy effect in both the divine and the human realm. On the di vine level, Satan is the doubt in Jehovah that leads him first to mistreat, then restore, his loyal servant. On the human 61</page><page sequence="10">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW level, Satan brings to the mind of man the knowledge that the god whom he serves is not a rational being but a total force in nature, destructive as well as creative. Satan's func tion is to oppose, and to negate, thereby to provide the con flict fundamental to any growth in consciousness. Job ex periences growth because his new awareness of Jehovah's irrationality lifts him beyond his servile role as a mere creature of nature, driving him inward to deeper contempla tion of the nature of suffering. Jehovah, too, experiences growth because he must reassess his relationship with his crea ture, man. Robert Frost, in a slyly amusing way, expresses this growth through the words of his character God, in his Sequel to Job. God addresses Job as follows: I've had you on my mind a thousand years To thank you some day for the way you helped me Establish once for all the principle There's no connection man can reason out Between his just deserts and what he gets. My thanks are to you for releasing me From moral bondage to the human race.8 After Satan's interference neither man nor god can be the same again. IV It is with this view of Satan that we are ready to examine Goethe's use of the Job myth as a frame for his Faust narra tive. The readers' first encounter with Goethe's Lord in the prologue in heaven makes it quite clear that he has long ago accepted the devil as part of his own divine entity. In this context, therefore, when the Lord sends Mephistopheles forth to test his servant Faust he benignly accepts the devil as part of his own overall plan to keep humanity striving. Man's efforts sink below his proper level, And since he seeks for unconditional ease, I send this fellow who must goad and tease And toil to serve creation, though a devil. »Robert Frost, The Masque of Reason (1945). 02</page><page sequence="11">JOB AND FAUST The Lord's awareness that the negative functions of evil demons like Mephistopheles provoke healthy opposition and irritation reminds one of the Socratic gadfly who ultimately benefits the state by stirring up the consciousness of its mem bers, driving men beyond the limitations of their animal selves toward an awareness of higher values. The role of Mephistopheles is now recognized as both essential and ad mirable, and the Lord's joviality toward his unwitting ser vant is a bit patronizing. But Faust, like Job, represents the culmination of a thought which had been maturing in mankind for a long time. The Faustian legend appeared on the literary scene at the time of the Reformation. The historical Johann Faust was a man of the fifteenth century whose life made its literary debut in a German prose narrative, published in 1587, and subsequently translated into English to become the basis for Marlowe's major treatment of the story in his Tragical History of Doctor Faustus. For Marlowe's hero, the object of a pact with the devil is the magician's own soul: he is willing to seek godlike aims in this world at the expense of salvation in the next. Disillusioned in his mastery of all known disciplines of study, the learned scholar wagers his soul for the sake of superhuman knowledge, knowing that he will be damned at the end of the twenty-four year con tractual period. With Goethe's Faust, the case is very different. This scholarly hero is also both aspiring and disillusioned, but even more he is restless. Furthermore, Goethe's hero is not primarily concerned with the afterlife. Faust is willing to gamble his soul in order to avoid surrender to a moment of contentment, but obviously he is not really concerned with damnation in the afterlife: The other side weighs little on my mind; Lay first this world in ruins, shattered, blind. Mephistopheles, on the other hand, offers what amounts to an exchange of services in terms of this world and the next: 63</page><page sequence="12">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW Then here below in service I'll abide, Fulfilling firelessly your least decree, If when we meet upon the other side You undertake to do the same for me. (p. 86) But Mephistopheles' attention is not focused on the afterlife either. He explains to the Lord that he has no desire to traffic with dead men. . . . it's repelling To have so much to do with the deceased. For me a glowing cheek is like a feast. I'm not at home to corpses in my house, (p. 41) The afterlife is not mentioned again until the very end of the poem. Whatever else Mephistopheles represents in Goe the's work, it is clear that he is not an underworld demon, but a creature at home in this world and among men. And, as the Lord is well aware, the ironic function of the devil among men is to prevent the divine in the human spirit from succumbing to sloth. The occasion of Mephistopheles' first appearance before Faust gives the first clue to his nature in this work. It will be recalled that Marlowe's devil first appeared in a shape too ugly to be endured, so that Faustus sent him away with sardonic instructions to return in the garb of a Franciscan friar. Marlowe was following the medieval and Renaissance view of the devil as a bestial figure, often depicted with horns and a tail and claws, a concept perhaps most familiar in Dante's hairy-thighed and bat-winged Satan at the center of the frozen lake of Cocytus. But Goethe, with subtle irony, has Mephistopheles appear as a traveling scholar. He resembles the scholarly Faust in appearance, as we learn from a later scene when a student mistakes the devil for the scholar, and the similarity suggests that the devilish guest is an alter ego for the learned doctor. Although Mephistoph eles does not at this time reveal his name, he is not at all reticent about himself but rather states his pedigree: Part of a part am I, that once was all, A part of darkness, mother of the light, 64</page><page sequence="13">JOB AND FAUST Proud light, that seeks a sway imperial, Outranking far the ancient realm of night, Yet strives in vain, doomed to be cleaving still To forms embodied, struggle as he will. (p. 75) The darkness with which he identifies himself is at once the primeval darkness of the Chaos which preceded creation—Faust later calls him "strange, sterile son of chaos" —and the equally primeval darkness of the unconscious, be fore the first differentiation of consciousness. The words in fact recall the creation myth in Genesis which refers both to the origin of the external world and to the origin of con sciousness—the outward and the inward manifestations re spectively of "let there be light." Mephistopheles is therefore associated with the forces of darkness in both their theolog ical and their psychological implications. Psychologically, Mephistopheles is associated with the dark, unconscious part of the psyche which is negative and destructive, what Jung called the "shadow." Whereas the Satan who appeared in Job was associated with the negative and destructive side of deity, his descend ant Mephistopheles is primarily associated with the corre spondingly dark side of man. Later in Part I of Faust, after the devil has introduced himself to the protagonist, Me phistopheles meets Wagner, Faust's protégé. When Wagner, a pedantic student, knocks at the scholar's door, Mephistoph eles answers, again wearing academic garb, this time the borrowed robes of Faust. He is heard gloating over his "pos session" of Faust, which is in effect Faust's possession of him as a suppressed element in his own nature. Now he is mine, without a saving clause, For fate has put a spirit in his breast That drives him madly on without a pause, And whose precipitate and rash behest O'erleaps the joys of earth and natural laws. (p. 92) In the ensuing exchange between student and mock master, Wagner never penetrates the disguise. The scene is a kind of a parody of the first meeting between Faust and Me phistopheles. 65</page><page sequence="14">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW Although the devil is clearly identified with Faust himself in this episode, in many passages in Part I he is of course objectively portrayed as well. He has an autonomous ex istence quite apart from his subjective identity with Faust. At one point, in conversation with one of the witches, he undertakes to explain certain significant changes in his his torical development. The speech is prompted by the witch's remark that she does not notice his cloven hoof. Society's improved at every level, And culture spreads now, even to the Devil. Gone is the spook that filled the North with awe, Outmoded are the horns, and tail and claws, Touching the foot, with which I can't dispense. My social circle might well take offence; And so, like many fashionable lads, I falsify my calves by using pads. (pp. 116-117) Obviously the appearance of the devil had changed, as any one following the depiction of Satan in art and literature through the centuries can readily confirm. By the eigh teenth century, the bestial figure who frightened medieval folk has become a gentleman and a scholar, a witty member of polite society. The realization of Mephistopheles' function comes slowly to Faust. In his address to the Earth Spirit, late in Part I, he describes his dawning discovery: Now do I see, no perfect thing is given To poor mankind. The bliss you have bestowed To bear me ever nearer to the gods Binds this companion to me: doomed I am To need the help of him whose impudence Ensures the cheap debasement of myself In my own sight, so much his subtle word Can sour and stifle all your gift of joy. (p. 145) As the narrative proceeds from here on, the independent role of Mephistopheles slowly declines. Once Faust becomes aware of the devil as representing a split-off part of his own nature, the separate role of the latter is reduced to that of a 66</page><page sequence="15">JOB AND FAUST witty but supernumerary yes-man. This is not to say that the diabolic element embodied in Mephistopheles loses impor tance. On the contrary, it becomes ever clearer that Me phistopheles is still the everlasting No in Faust. He pre cipitates the continual destruction involved in continual renewal. But the external function of the devil must recede once the protagonist recognizes the negative principle—"the spirit that denies"—as an inevitable and essential part of himself. Mephistopheles' role declines most drastically after the episode of the visit to the "mothers" in Part II. In this highly symbolic scene, the devil admits that he can do nothing to help Faust but can only direct him to the mysterious mothers, who can be visited by means of a descent undertaken with a magic tripod. The strange quest is necessary in order for Faust to get the power to bring Helen of Troy back to life. This peculiarly creative power can be gained only through the process of the epic Ka.taba.sis, or voyage to hell. For such a voyage, symbolically underground to indicate the depths of Faust's own subconscious nature, the devil is useless as a creature external to himself. Once Faust recognizes the powerful dynamic of his own subconscious, there is little more that the nay-saying Mephistopheles can offer him. Armed with the magic tripod, then, the scholar sinks through the ground, only to return triumphantly in the following scene with the recreated Helen. At this point the Mephis tophelean spirit within Faust has completely overshadowed the outward demon. Mephistopheles' appearances are relatively rare thereafter in Part II. Translator Philip Wayne remarks of his declining stature in the poem that in the second Walpurgisnacht scene the devil appears ill at ease and not very knowledgeable about the classics. In the final episodes concerned with the death of Faust, Mephistopheles appears again, first to be bombarded with roses, in the manner of medieval conven tional symbolism, then to voice his frustration over the loss of the victim he had worked so hard to win. He compares 67</page><page sequence="16">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW himself to Job. "How is't with me?"—Like Job, the man seen whole,/With boil on boil, and sick of his own soul." It is significant that Mephistopheles compares himself—not Faust—to Job. The devil has become humanized. A moment of comedy in Part II nicely focuses on the ambivalent attitude of Goethe's age toward the anthropo morphic depiction of evil. In this amusing episode, Sir Runic Rump, astonished at the appearance of Mephistopheles, ex claims: "Be off with you, you've been explained away!" But Goethe of course was wise enough to know that the devil cannot be explained away—he can only be driven into hiding or disguise. Since the age of enlightenment denied evil in tellectually, however, the devil was often put out of sight, in this case into man himself. Although Goethe's witty demon is very much an independent personality, he is also in significant ways a projection of Faust's "shadow"—"the spirit that denies." The devil as a personification of evil had been banished before, long before the Enlightenment. In the early period of Christianity, the Gnostics were rejected as a heretical sect for considering the anti-Christ as the fourth side of godhood. The demonic figure complemented the trinity, in effect making it a quaternity by incorporating the spirit of negation. After the doctrinal rejection, the figure of evil was projected into bestial form, and beast he remained until the Renaissance gradually transformed him into a humanized figure. The "new" devil, whom Goethe objectifies as Me phistopheles, was historically coincident with the new Ren aissance man, the Faustian individual who sought infinite knowledge but rejected metaphysical dualism only to find a corresponding dualism manifested within his own depths. From the viewpoint of the two devil-figures, therefore, the parallels between the two works under consideration become increasingly apparent. In each case a discovery of the nature of the devil has a profound effect on man's awareness of himself and of godhood. The book of Job depicted the discovery of the devil in deity and man's sub 68</page><page sequence="17">JOB AND FAUST sequent elevation through this knowledge. In the words of Kluger: "At the end Job is inwardly 'expanded'; he is able to comprehend an experience of God which, if he still had been the simple, unproblematic, pious Job, and if Satan had not driven him to come to terms with the deus absconditus, would probably have split him apart." The book of Faust depicts the discovery of the devil in man and the correspond ing elevation of man made possible by that new knowledge. Faust abandoned what Jung called his "inflated one-sided ness which saw the devil only outside." In the case of both Job and Faust, the devil is genuinely Luciferian as a bringer of light: it is the devil who brings man the knowledge of God in his light-dark aspect. Goethe's use of the Job myth offers a recurring reflection of this eternal experience in the mind of man. 69</page></plain_text>
