<plain_text><page sequence="1">Le grand jeu and the Great Game: The Politics of Play in Walter Scott's Waverley and Rudyard Kipling's Kim Chris Ann Matteo Although nearly a full century divides Waverley's anonymous publication in 1814 and the 1901 date on Kipling's novel, the Great Game functions in both tales as a specific, metaphoric code word for the relationship between England and her annexed colonies. Set in his vast and diverse contempo- rary context of turn-of-the-century India, Kipling's novel conceives the Great Game as an intricate system of English surveillance which attempts to avert and anticipate the internal treachery of power-hungry native Ra- jahs and the external maneuvers of the invading Russian enemy. In the fol- lowing brief passage we hear Kim's friend Mahbub Ali mention the Great Game rather ominously: "... Lurgan Sahib has a shop among the Euro- pean shops. All Simla knows it .... and Friend of all the World, he is one to be obeyed to the last wink of his eyelashes. Men say he does magic, but that shall not touch thee. Go up the hill and ask. Here begins the Great Game."l Likewise, in Scott's work, le grand jeu represents a historical struggle: the Rebellion of 1745, when the Scots allied in war to reinstate "the Adventurer" Charles Edward to the throne of England. "&lt;Ah, Beau- jeu, mon cher ami&gt;&gt;, said he as he returned to his usual place in the line of march, &lt;que mon metier de prince errant est ennuyant, par fois. Mais courage! c'est le grand jeu, apr~s tout&gt;&gt;" (Waverley 58:403).2 JNT. Journal of Narrative Theory 30.2 (Summer 2000): 163-186. Copyright c 2000 by JNT Journal of Narrative Theory.</page><page sequence="2">164 N T Against the expansive historical and political chronotope of the game--a term I will detail shortly-both novels figure the central player as an English youth in transition from boyhood to maturity: descended from English knights of loyal Tory politics,Waverley's ancestral origins are indisputably more stable and aristocratic than Kim's; yet, despite his poverty and orphanhood, Kim nevertheless practices undeniable privilege in that multifarious and caste-conscious Indian society, solely due to being a sahib, that is, a white man. The courses of both novels shuttle the hero through the boundaries of a perilous political climate; the centripetal hero, whom we might very easily identify with the average English reader, starts out at a static "home base," from which the plot casts him, centrifugally, to investigate and explore the mysterious unknown that lies beyond home, which is alien, foreign, distinct from oneself (Bakhtin 1968, 1981). Furthermore, the hero's investigation of the frontiers of self and other can be likened to the intriguing fusion of genres in the two novels, for both authors artfully weave the story of the education and maturation of the young man, or the bildungsroman plot, with the romantic mythos of an ad- venture, and specifically, an adventure of espionage (Bakhtin 1986, Frye 1971). The heroes' formal education is part of the story, as well as motiva- tional pretext for the story. For instance, we learn that young Edward Wa- verley, in spite of the aristocratic advantages of his uncle's rich library and his quick native apprehension, idles through his reading without disci- pline, thoroughness, or discrimination (Waverley 5:45-49). Beyond simply accounting for Edward's serious character flaw-his inclination to mental "absence" (Waverley 7:73)--this orients the project of the novel to guide Waverley through an alternative, "real education" of experience; and so, his meaningful education commences when his Highland adventure be- gins, and where his formal schooling and military indoctrination end. And in the case of Kim, we need only return to Mahbub Ali's speech, above. There, Kim's longtime street-confidante, horse-trader, and Ethno- logical Survey agent, Mahbub has freed Kim from "imprisonment" in the Sahib school, where he has been beaten by envious older boys and con- strained in uniform. But upon the boy's liberation, Mahbub inducts Kim into the science and art of practical observation under the direction of the Healer of Pearls, Lurgan Sahib. At Lurgan's market stall, Kim rehearses his skills of measurement and estimation with his young Hindu tutor (Kim 9:206), which is essential training for Kim's future employment as a</page><page sequence="3">Le grand jeu and the Great Game 165 chain-man in the Survey.3 As Lurgan explains to the boy who is to teach Kim the skills of calculation, speculation, bluffing and profitable trade, "In a little while he [Kim] will go away again. But now he is at school-at a new madrissah-and thou shalt be his teacher. Play the Play of the Jewels against him" (Kim 7:204).4 So, as bildungsromane, the two novels contrast regimented and vicarious "book learning" to wisdom gained through ac- tion and engagement. But before the plots of the books can arrive at that sense of content- ment and settlement so characteristic of English bildungsromane, the child-hero must explore foreign territory, and so, acquaint himself with its allied literary form, the adventure-romance.5 The fact that both Waverley and Kim engage in espionage and treasonable acts reminds us that the sec- ond phase, the "real education," is fraught with evil and potential danger, and so, recalls the outlines of a typical romance knight on a heroic quest to subdue the mysterious foe. Thus, a lad's growing up-his personal culti- vation, his social domestication-becomes magnified as an act of survival, whose stakes are set at nothing less than life or death. Kim boasts brazenly in the midst of his adventure, that he longs to have a "price on his head," his personal value not merely estimated or judged, but indeed com- pounded and highly prized (Kim 1:71-73 &amp; 11:198 f.). And though Waverley shares none of Kim's daring defiance (recall Kim's initial straddling pose on Zam-Zammah in the first sentence of the novel), his first journey into the Highlands gains him both a reputation and something resembling personal conviction. At the point in the novel when he finds himself incarcerated, unwittingly, because of a brawl with a local smithy at Cairnvreckan (Waverley 30:240 ff.), Edward also finds himself accused of treason by contagion or association as it were, through the in- criminating circumstances of his accepting the hospitality of Fergus Mac- Ivor. Waverley's motivations are submitted to interrogation by Major Melville and Mr Morton, and the title of that chapter, "An Examination," ironically reminds us that this episode is not just a pop-quiz for the truant school-boy, but is rather a test of character. This test-as-quest reveals the particular contribution of the romance mythos to the plot of Waverley's de- velopment; what seemed to be a novel concerned with gaining knowledge and experience now becomes a test of character, a trial-at-law, a medieval ordeal. So, while Kim and Waverley are embarked upon their adventurous</page><page sequence="4">166 IN T journeys, infiltrating foreign lands and gaining knowledge of the alien, they are also outlaws "beyond protection" (Kim 11:200), or, in the playful words of Kim's narrator, "out of bounds" (Kim 6:148, 7:171). Through the generic magic of the adventure-romance, the hero's story of personal transformation becomes an act of political and territorial transgression. The novels Kim and Waverley turn an individual young man's internal, temporal and biographical journey outward as an externalized expedition through peripheral geographies and cultural history. What effect does this spying and infiltration of generic domains have upon the historical mean- ings of the novels? In other words, why do both Kipling and Scott choose to tell a story about imperial history through the investigative lens of the growing young Englishman? I suggest that Waverley and Kim act as tex- tual undercover scouts who explore the vagaries, the development, and the expanse of the British Empire itself, in short, a national bildungsroman- biography of the increasing colonial power of England. By synecdoche, each hero plays the part for the whole, the Englishman for England. In this way, as Martin Green has persuasively argued, the average English reader identifies with the "middling" hero, who plods and plots on the periphery or in a space in-between. Through the hero's adventures the reader may at- tempt to reconcile his conflicts about England's annexation of the Scots and her subjugation of India.6 And, so that the author may disguise this historical truth, the semantic domain of what I call "the chronotope of the game" operates as a uniquely flexible narrative instrument. The pervasive evocation of games, sport, and play in both the novels spans a range of meaning which grounds itself, at one conceptual limit, in the rote repetition of prescribed actions such as the Play of the Jewels in Kim. This chronotope passes through gradations of increasing skill and cunning such as the brilliant spectacle of the mili- tary exercises at Glennaquoich (Waverley 19:160) or the subsequent mock-heroic stag hunt (Waverley 24:187-189). And it ultimately defines its outer limit in Kim's adept play-acting and disguise as well as Waver- ley's eventual ability to travel incognito both at home and abroad.7 In its most general definition, a game may be thought of as a system of provisional rules which, with the consent of the players, define reality through the duration of the play (Huizinga 1980). The game is, in one sense, rigid in its restrictions, yet, in another sense, it is elastic and re- silient insofar as it is temporary and voluntary. The successful player, then,</page><page sequence="5">Le grand jeu and the Great Game 167 is a boy who begins by being subject to the rules and "going by the book," and who later progresses to a state of mastery and winning autonomy, or self-rule. This is an opportune moment to shed light on the chronotope as con- cept and literary tool. When Bakhtin defines this term in his essay "Forms of Time and the Chronotope," he writes suggestively, "Time as it were, thickens, takes on flesh, becomes artistically visible; likewise, space be- comes charged and responsive to the movements of time, plot and history" (Bakhtin 84). Aptly elaborated by Wayne Booth, the chronotope is "a pic- ture of timed place and placed time" (Booth 1984, p. xxvi). The history of the word in rhetoric and philosophy can be derived from Aristotle, who used the term, topos, meaning "place," as a metaphor for the rhetorical convention of the commonplace (Rhetoric 1358a-1359a). Bakhtin's chronotope, then, is a topos-or a "theme," a diachronically shared narra- tive pattern-inflected by time, chronos. The critic should be careful not to confuse the chronotope with traditionally recognized poetic tropes; lit- erary theorist Darko Suvin has written persuasively about the differences between a metaphor and a chronotope, stressing that the chronotope is a "narrative" metaphor (Suvin 51). The chronotope is a prosaic phenome- non, fully incarnational, verbally material, and immanent (Morson and Emerson, passim). Biographer and critic Michael Holquist glosses this as- sertion: "Time and space do indeed work... as the shaping tools by which the potentially infinite variety of the world is molded into specific forms. But the site at which such molding occurs is not transcendent." Under- stood correctly, Holquist adds, "chronotope is not a term that can be in- voked..,. in general" (Holquist 151). Thus, interpretation of any chrono- tope must be anchored and interpreted within the particular narratives where it is found.8 With this definition and the goals of the hero's education in mind, it is possible to appreciate how the chronotope of the Great Game extends from the individual player to his political context, since the semantic field of the game affords the abundant opportunities for acquiring power.9 The terms of play glide effortlessly into relations of domination. The loser of the game is akin to the annexed colonial subject, just as the winner as- sumes the role of the master. The rules of the game are enforced by a gov- ernment that dispenses its rewards and penalties in the forms of honors and preference, or in severe and brutal discipline, as well as capital</page><page sequence="6">168 IN T punishment. The players or volunteers in the Great Game are seduced to consent or bullied through coercion. "Fair play"-which, by the way, is a good translation for the French surname of Bonnie Prince Charlie's lieu- tenant, "Beaujeu," from the initial passage quoted from Waverley- translates into partisan loyalty, and cheating translates into treachery. Once both heroes graduate from school to school through the initiating magic of the game metaphor, and as each develops from "green" inductee to master and magister, then all the relations of personal power and political com- mitment must be diplomatically renegotiated. Each transition between stages entails new rules and new risks. And each painful, difficult grade passage in the game is occasioned by the illumination of a personal dis- covery, the unveiling of an understanding heretofore unknown.10 This transitional discovery betrays identity, faith, and allegiance. Wit- ness Kim's indignant anger when his friend Mahbub barters with Col. Creighton to enroll Kim at St. Xavier's sahib academy, thereby betraying his friendship and thence sending him to further "captivity": as Kim bit- terly complains, "Trust a Brahmin before a snake, and a snake before an harlot, and an harlot before a Pathan, Mahbub Ali" (Kim 6:158). Likewise, Edward's stunning demystification happens while engaged in the Preston skirmish, where a military drill transforms into the reality of battle: ... They approached so near, that Waverley could plainly recognise the standard of the troop he had formerly com- manded, and hear the trumpets and kettle-drums sound the signal of advance, which he had so often obeyed. He could hear, too, the well-known word given in the English di- alect, by the equally well-distinguished voice of the com- manding officer, for whom he had once felt so much re- spect. It was at that instant, that, looking around him, he saw the wild dress and appearance of his Highland associ- ates, heard their whispers in an uncouth and unknown lan- guage, looked upon his own dress, so unlike that which he had worn from his infancy, and wished to awake from what seemed at the moment a dream, strange, horrible, and un- natural. "Good God!" he muttered, "am I then a traitor to my country, a renegade to my standard, and a foe..,. to my native England?" (Waverley 46:333-334)</page><page sequence="7">Le grand jeu and the Great Game 169 Here, Edward experiences the uncanny (unheimlich), an estrangement (os- traniene) from his adopted Highland alliances even as he confronts and examines his native affiliations and their political consequences." This episode illustrates how Waverley's escalating confrontations with diffi- culty in his game of growth raises the stakes-both the reward and the risk-from a personal level to a political level. The metaphor of the game marks and evaluates stages of personal and political loyalty, and this must remind the reader of the interchangeability of the individual hero for the historical allegory. As the Empire grows, there is more to gain, and more to lose. Having investigated how the bildungsroman's gaming process trans- lates into political and historical consequences, let us redirect our explo- ration toward the other element in the generic alliance that the game medi- ates: the realm of the fantastic, of adventure, espionage, romance. At its pole of rote repetition as a form of learning, the chronotope of the Great Game overlaps the boundary of the bildungsroman; and at its other pole of disguise, costumery, and make-believe, the Great Game hovers at the bor- ders of play, of magical fictionality and the illusions of art. In Kim and Waverley, the heroes' quest for maturity and identity is accentuated by nu- merous disguises. For example, Waverley's desertion to the Stuart cause is emphatically figured as effortlessly as a costume-change. In the following extract, Fergus, the young chief of Glennaquoich, gives stage-directions to his personal tailor, Shemus an Snaht: "Get a plaid of Mac-Ivor tartan, and sash... and a blue bonnet of the Prince's pattern. .... My short green coat, with silver lace and silver buttons, will fit him exactly, and I have never worn it .... pick out a handsome target from among mine. The prince has given Mr Waverley broad- sword and pistols, I will furnish him with a dirk and purse; add but a pair of low heeled shoes, and then my dear Ed- ward... you will be a complete son of Ivor." (Waverley 41:300) At this point, Fergus' vivid, detailed description of Edward's new habit amounts to arming him, but also works as charming him into a "complete son of Ivor"; one can easily imagine the tailor as a Disney fairy godmother</page><page sequence="8">170 N T chanting "bibbety-bobbety-boo". The adoption of his Highlander costume masks Edward in a new-found status and commitment; it is not until later in the story, in real engagement of battle at Preston, that the ruse will sting his conscience. And as for Kim, he positively exults in his innate talent for mimicry and disguise. The words of Mahbub Ali deftly characterize Kim's magical ability for imitation and impersonation: "'He was born in the land. He has friends. He goes where he chooses. He is a chabuk sawai [a sharp chap]. It [sic] needs only to change his clothing, and in a twinkling he would be a low caste Hindu boy... '" (Kim 6:156). Kim's revel in play affords him fluidity and flexibility of identity which bedazzles his elders, such as when Kim encounters Teshoo Lama, the Parson-Adams-esque Ti- betan monk he meets in front of the Lahore Wonder-House at the outset of the novel. Comprising both self and other under disguise, impersonation allows the Englishman to explore the foreign personality as if from the na- tive point-of-view. Later, under his apprenticeship at Lurgan Sahib's, this gift for sum- moning illusion allows Kim to conquer his jewel-tutor with his own untu- tored skill. Kim's mastery reaches far beyond Edward's quick-change trick-his sympathetic magic, as it were. Kim's acting is in effect entering "another's soul," an efficient charm (Kim 9:207).12 In fact, this early episode is a rehearsal for that marvelous moment when Kim works his charm of healing-his talent as a make-up artist--on the injured and vul- nerable Mahratta agent on the train to Benares: Kim had been trained by Lurgan Sahib; and E23, by virtue of his business, was no bad actor. In place of the tremulous, shrinking trader there lolled against the corner an all but naked, ash-smeared, ochre-barred, dusty-haired Saddhu, his swollen eyes--opium takes quick effect on an empty stomach--luminous with insolence and bestial lust, his legs crossed under him, Kim's brown rosary round his neck, and a scant yard of worn, flowered chintz on his shoulders. (Kim 11:244) This incident strikingly compares the consequences of disguise for Kim, the white sahib, with the native agent. Impersonation impresses the spec- tators as well as the readers in its flourish of freedom and mastery, as in</page><page sequence="9">Le grand jeu and the Great Game 171 the amazement of a father and child who witness this disguise, "'Look up Princeling! We travel with warlocks, but they will not hurt thee... "(Kim 11:244). But it also blurs and distorts the very real risk that results from spying upon the alien: the possibility of discovery and the danger of betrayal. To our amazement, the Mahratta-turned-Saddhu that Kim has disguised does escape assassination, but consider the grisly outcomes of the treacherous Donald Bean Lean and Callum Beg in Waverley, whose executions are presented as the just deserts of duplicity and disguise. Therefore, by virtue of their racial privilege and "heroic" status, our cen- tral players Kim and Waverley are permitted to toy with a treachery which is nonetheless absolutely deadly to enemies of the state. To extend this magic of make-believe from the level of the novels' characters to the charm it works upon the historical reading audience, the hero's disguise indulges the British reader's pretense of knowing, experi- encing, and perhaps suffering like the subject of that alien culture. The sin- ister political consequence of this illusion of mastery is the unquestioned right to power for the English, on the one hand, and submission or death for the alien, on the other. Kim and Edward are safe to play at hide-and- seek, to steal into the mystery of the unknown only because each is, in Kim's own words, "one of us" (Kim 8:185, 9:209). Thus far, this survey of the frontiers of the Great Game has shown us how the generic provinces of the bildungsroman and romantic adventure ally the growing hero's journey to a political dimension. This study has thus far stressed the familiar and common features of the novels' charac- ters, plots, and themes. Yet the emphasis upon the specifically historical, imperial and political significance of the novels should prompt us to recall the ninety years which distances the two books. Waverley appears at the beginning of the nineteenth century, about twenty years before Victoria as- cends the British throne, and Kim is published precisely at the end of her reign as queen and Kaisar-i-Hind. Together these texts of empire stand as the temporal boundary-markers of the floruit of the pax Victoria. If my in- tuition that these books encode a story of England's growing colonial power is valid, is it possible,then, to detect any changes or developments in that growth by re-examining the texts' distinctive devices?13 What follows in this paper, this next phase of "intelligence," as it were, will trace the function of heraldry. Iconic totems in each book suggest the differing origins and respective destinies of each hero as he seeks to define</page><page sequence="10">172 1 N T his homeland and distinguish himself from the alien outside. Looking at the contrasts in the books through their respective emblems of heraldry of- fers some solutions to the historical questions of imperial power which are proposed here. Both Waverley and Kim exploit heraldic iconography in order to situate the heroes within a historical family lineage on the one hand, and there- after to guide the hero towards his personal destiny, on the other. In Wa- verley, a man is identified and authenticated by his family's coat-of-arms, whereas Kim is drawn to a primitive, feral totem.14 The legendary blazon awakens the hero to the interpretation of the family metaphor, which trans- fers or bestows the family's status and significance from the clan to the child. In Edward's story, this illuminating event of family identification is tellingly related in Chapter 2, as the narrator muses, "I know not whether the boy's nurse had been a Welsh or a Scotch woman, or in what manner he associated a shield emblazoned with three ermines with the idea of per- sonal property, but he no sooner beheld this family emblem than he stoutly determined on vindicating his right to the splendid vehicle on which it was displayed" (Waverley 2:43). This episode illustrates not only Waverley's adamant claim to stable roots and situation in his family, but also Ed- ward's magical ease of reading his family sign. The emblem is endowed with an oracular and portentous valence. Thus, the coat-of-arms both ex- plains the hero's origins and further predicts where he might conclude his adventure: in other words, the beginning and end of his putative life- narrative. The blazon provokes a number of queries: Will Edward resusci- tate the heroic spirit of his medieval ancestor Sir Nigel, and grow into the family mold? Will Edward support the Whig government, or resort to his family's Tory inclinations, or worse yet, desert and join the radical clan of zealous Stuart supporters? Can Edward protect the family crest from im- pure and Whiggish taint, the dread of his Tory Uncle Everard? Thus, Ed- ward's Highland adventure through espionage and political intrigue will test the prophetic power of the badge with its three ermines passant. In addition to probing Edward's wavering loyalties through the adven- ture plot, Waverley offers an alternative plot regarding family icons in the figure of the Baron of Bradwardine, whose minatory motto declares, "Bewar the Bar." As Edward enters the Lowland Scottish estate at Tully- Veolan, the weathered yet rampant Bradwardine bears menace the visitor</page><page sequence="11">Le grand jeu and the Great Game 173 (Waverley 8:77). Shortly thereafter, the Blessed Bear cup is to blame for Edward's polite level of inebriation during a hospitable, but politically precarious, assembly of the Baron's locals (Waverley 11:93), and so, there, Bear serves him a comic warning: when a family, such as Bradwardine's, programmatically and reiteratively proliferates its archaic, obsolete cus- toms, there is a grave potential for the degradation of identity and author- ity. The pedantic Baron glowers at the suggestion that his family's name, "Brad-wardine," might punningly be translated as "quasi Bear-warden" by an act of "canting heraldry" or false etymology. Below, he tells of the ancestral resentment between himself and his cousin, Hew Halbert, who dared to deform the pure original name-form, as if under the spell of some infectious disease of language (Waverley 14:117).15 "... it not only insinuated that the founder of our house occupied such a mean situation as to be a custodier of wild beasts, a charge which, ye must have observed, is only en- trusted to the very basest plebeians, but, moreover, seemed to infer that our coat-armour had not been achieved by hon- orable actions in war, but bestowed by way ofparanoma- sia, or pun on our family appellation--a sort of bearing which the French call annrmoires parlantes; the Latins, anna cantantia; and your English authorities, canting heraldry; being indeed a species of emblazoning more befitting can- ters, gaberlunzies, and suchlike mendicants, whose gibber- ish is formed upon playing upon the word, than the noble, honourable, and useful science of heraldry, which assigns armorial bearings as the reward of noble and generous ac- tions, and not to tickle the ear with vain quodlibets, such as are found in jest-books." (Waverley 14:117) Ironically, however, the Baron later willingly deforms his own family crest as he enacts his strict claim to "detrahendi, seu exuendi, caligas regis post batalliam," or, to relieve the king of his boots after battle (Waverley 48:344). Though the Baron seeks promotion and honor by insisting on the ceremonial enactment of the charter's title, this ritual transforms the metaphoric Bear into a toiling Bear-warden, degrades the heraldic hero to submissive subject, and defiles the blazon's rampant Bear with the addition of a prosaic bootstrap (Waverley 50:356-7). His consensual</page><page sequence="12">174 1 N T degradation foreshadows the Baron's eventual defeat by force in the Re- bellion, the defacement and destruction of the family den at Tully-Veolan by English occupying soldiers (Waverley 64:433), and his retreat and con- cealment in the bear's cave following Culloden (Waverley 65:443). The caveat latent in "Bewar the Bar" can be applied as a political warning. When set beside the Waverley crest, which embodies the fear of moral, family, and political taint, then the Baron's badge alerts us to the vacilla- tions between obedience and autonomy, or, to phrase it in the Baron's own words, when to act under an authority in loco parentis, and when to act sui juris, by self-rule (Waverley 11:98). Indeed the story of the Baron's emblem satirizes the system of heraldry more than it ennobles it; but Edward can nonetheless learn from its exam- ple, for in its most ancient origins, we learn that the Baron's crest was not strictly inherited, but earned by conquest. The Baron us tells that the em- blem was "a wappen-brief a concession of arms" in a Holy Land crusade (Waverley 11:93). Thus his blazon is chronotopic--not only a metaphor, but a metonymic medal that recalls the moment and narrative of its victo- rious capture.16 The Baron's positive lesson and legacy for Edward, then, is the imperative to transform the symbol into action. Waverley must con- vert his family metaphor into a functional instrument of personal power. The hero must go beyond the divination of the bearings of his family coat- of-arms; rather, he must literally "bear arms" in order to achieve family status. The miraculous denouement of Waverley signals the fulfillment of the family prophecy. The Highland rebellion withers in defeat, and the culmi- nation of Chapter 60 reminds us explicitly of the ultimate boundary of Ed- ward's adventure of maturity: "he acquired a more complete mastery of a spirit tamed by adversity than his former experience had given him; and that he felt himself entitled to say firmly, though perhaps with a sigh, that the romance of his life was ended, and that its real history had now com- menced" (Waverley 60:415). Yet, through the stratagem of Col. Talbot and the marvelous absolving power of childhood "ignorance" (Waverley 32:252, 68:463), Edward escapes punishment for his treacherous Jacobite entanglement. As a result of this wonderful exoneration, the frontier be- tween the "real history" and Edward's fantasy is obscured. It is as if his warlike action alone, regardless of his allegiance or loyalty, entitles him to exhibit his Highland arms-trophies and souvenirs of his adventure-in</page><page sequence="13">Le grand jeu and the Great Game 175 the restored Bradwardine mansion upon the occasion of his marriage- alliance to Rose (Waverley 71:489). The description of the new oil paint- ing that graces Tully-Veolan epitomizes the morally purifying action of art as it commemorates Edward and Fergus' partnership in the '45:17 ... There was ... a large and spirited painting, represent- ing Fergus Mac-Ivor and Waverley in their Highland dress, the scene a wild, rocky, and mountainous pass, down which the clan were descending in the background. It was taken from a spirited sketch, drawn while they were in Edinburgh by a young man of genius, and had been painted on a full length scale by an eminent London artist. Raeburn himself, (whose Highland chiefs do all but walk out of the canvas) could not have done more justice to the subject; and the ar- dent, fiery, and impetuous character of the unfortunate Chief of Glennaquoich was finely contrasted with the con- templative, fanciful, and enthusiastic expression of his hap- pier friend. Beside this painting hung the arms which Wa- verley had borne in the unfortunate civil war. The whole piece was generally admired. (Waverley 71:489) Thus the potential for fiction to convert the family crest from symbol to action has cloaked Edward's perjury with an aesthetic conjury. The ending is a comfortable one for the English reader, but it masks ancestral entitle- ment to power with a fiction of having earned it through performance. Heraldic significance in Kim reveals a different moral stress. The early chapters of the novel find Kim joined with Teshoo Lama on parallel quests: the holy man's search for the River of the Arrow, and Kim's search for the meaning of his foster-mother's prophecy, the clue to his identity (Kim 1:50). Kim wears a family heirloom, a totemic amulet containing his birth certificate and his deceased father's Masonic and military docu- ments; and although he cannot yet decipher the "Angrezi" writing on the magical papers, Kim, like the five-year old Waverley, has no difficulty translating the personal meaning of its bestial icon, as his encounter at the Maverick's camp demonstrates: He pointed to the flag that was snap-snapping in the evening breeze not ten feet away. It was not more than an</page><page sequence="14">176 IN T ordinary camp marking-flag; but the regiment, always punctilious in matters of millinery, had charged it with the regimental device, the Red Bull, which is the crest of the Mavericks-the great Red Bull on a background of Irish green... "True. It is true." The lama stared fixedly at the device that flamed like a ruby in the dusk... (Kim 5:128) This excerpt illustrates how both the lama's devotion to the spiritual read- ing of experience coupled with Kim's (and the reader's) anticipation of the consummation of his natal horoscope, bestows the ordinary regimental flag with the status and power of a charm. Yet, even as the novel grants this icon a shimmering mystical power, its illusion is brief, because Kim's comprehension of the Red Bull all too quickly changes to Kim's bodily apprehension by the regiment's guards-he is taken into martial arrest. As the amulet's contents are explicated in the custody of Father Victor and Bennett, the protective talisman that could be Kim's key to freedom and empowerment becomes Kim's ticket (tikkut) to bondage. Upon discovery of his origins, he is sent to the regimental and St. Xavier's schools, to learn what it means to be a white man. The compelling demands of the child-what Freud once called "the high-chair tyrant"-are thus submit- ted to discipline in order to pass into adult mastery (Freud 1961). From then on and throughout the course of the book, the words of Mahbub Ali-"Once a Sahib, always a Sahib"-replace the female opium-eater's divination of Kim's natal chart as the accurate prediction of Kim's charac- ter and place in the world (Kim 6:155). The exploration, then, of"Who is Kim?" is less about the past and his family origins than it is the examina- tion of how Kim gains self-possession as a white man. When Kim detects the the significance of this mundane camp banner, it shows how the novel flirts with an attraction to spiritual or transcendent, as opposed to the realistic or material, answers to identity and personal purpose. It also illustrates how the novel virtually exploits prophecy as a narrative propellant. Through a certain lens of inspection, from the view- point of Col. Creighton for instance (whom Edward Said has identified as Kipling himself), the luminous potential of the totem is reduced to simple scientific fact.18 Creighton's pithy comment on Kim's escapade might very easily be recognized as identical to the point-of-view of the average</page><page sequence="15">Le grand jeu and the Great Game 177 English reader: "'You see, as an ethnologist, the thing's very interesting to me. I'd like to make a note of it for some Government work that I'm doing. The transformation of a regimental badge like your Red Bull into a sort of fetish that the boy follows is very interesting'" (Kim 6:161). Thus, Creighton's science of ethnology transforms the visionary symbol into a comprehensible and potentially collectible artifact. The charm glows omi- nously, yet remains concretely grounded in the mundane.19 This process that demystifies the allure of metaphor is maintained throughout the novel. Eventually, as Hurree Babu inducts Kim into the Sat Bhai, the secret society of the Seven Brothers, Kim replaces his former Red Bull amulet with the new, "effeecient amulet [sic]" of espionage (Kim 10:230-231). This new lucky-charm marks Kim's penultimate initiation into the society of "one of us" when he gains employment as a chain-man in the Ethnological Survey.20 Just as the exchange of the amulets indicates how the hero passes from his family inheritance to his elected and adopted "family" in the Secret Seven, so has Kim graduated from his childhood potential to his adult ability and functionality. Less a protective evil-eye than a serviceable tool in Kim's hands, the amulet immediately enables Kim to detect the Mahratta agent and assist him to safety, as we have al- ready seen (Kim 11:198 ff.).21 In that episode, the distinguishing detail of the amulet summons the code word of recognition, "Son of the Charm"; and so, the amulet, an ostensible "fact" of native superstition, operates as an illusory cover for the "real" identities and functions of the spies. This powerful object, which might transcend the realm of mundane meaning as a metaphor, is put to work, so to speak, and so never leaves the plane of metonymy and prosaic, realistic functionality. The climactic resolution of the book ultimately confirms Kim's experi- ence of growth and maturation as immersion in his material and metonymic context, his being ecstatically and keenly "in the middle of it all" (Kim 4:121). The lama's seductive spiritual search has chastened and refined Kim, and fever brings him to the very limit of where the body loosens from the soul. But rather than settling beyond this world, Kim's search for identity is finalized in concrete and comprehensible reality: "I am Kim. I am Kim. And what is Kim?" His soul re- peated it again and again. He did not want to cry-had never felt less like crying</page><page sequence="16">178 I N T in his life but of a sudden easy, stupid tears trickled down his nose, and with an almost audible click he felt the wheels of his being lock up anew on the world without. Things that rode meaningless on the eyeball an instant be- fore slid into proper proportion. Roads were meant to be walked upon, houses to be lived in, cattle to be driven, fields to be tilled, and men and women to be talked to. They were all real and true-solidly planted upon the feet-perfectly comprehensible-clay of his clay, neither more nor less. (Kim 15:331) Here, Kim passes from a meditative mantra, the enchanting repetition of his own name, to the mechanized mastery of the world for its use-value, its utility; the land and its people exist as a promise of their future produc- tivity. Kim's profoundly confident attainment of self-possession is ac- cented by the solidly tangible "clay of his clay," as well as the appropriate fitness of perfectly adequate maturation, "neither more nor less." The at- tachment to the past, in the way that Waverley strives to live up to his an- cestors, is unknown here. Instead, Kim's accession to mastery is achieved through discipline rather than magic, and through the exertion of labor, employment and effort rather than entitlement. In addition, Kim accrues the estimable acquisition of merit rather than inheritance of family honor, as is Waverley's case.22 Under the rubric of heraldry, then, my investigation thus far has ana- lyzed how that system of symbolism mediates the poles of metaphor and metonymy in the two novels, and how each book supplies distinctive moral conclusions concerning each hero's success in his accession to adulthood. Waverley is more ambivalent, and seems to want to retain both reality and romance of mastery; Kim is more firmly and convincingly op- timistic in its realization of power. Scott's inclination to wizardry can be made understandable, however, by his role as initiator of the genre that Kipling clearly knew well. It is worthwhile to consider the moral consequences of each young man's mastery, and thereby get a bead on the historical and political rami- fications for the British Empire's very own bildung. If we liken the heroes' acquisition of knowledge, experience, and autonomy as an analog to the British Empire itself, we are then prompted to explore how the books in-</page><page sequence="17">Le grand jeu and the Great Game 179 vestigate more general historical questions: What are the bounds of em- pire? How different is the other from the self? If we consider Waverley at the "infancy" of the British bildungsroman of empire, and then set Kim at a point of ripening into that genre's "peak" representative, we detect a moral and political spectrum that spans from Scott's somewhat half-hearted, somewhat timid, somewhat tentative first attempt to fictionalize England's subjugation of an alien land, to Kipling's far more confident pose. There is a further contrast to underline: while Waverley's personal dilemmas are conflicts of principle, Kim's are threats to profit, to growth in a commercial and colonial sense. In terms of geographies and peoples, Scott's imagination of the bound- aries of empire in Waverley barely stretches beyond the author's own na- tive island, and the novel explores the most proximate boundary of the Scottish nation, England's northern neighbor and the author's own patria. In its attempt to dramatize the enemy of the homeland, the novel insists upon and perhaps exaggerates the "racial" difference between the central English hero and the Scots, even as it presents Scotland as a prehistory of England (Lukics). In Waverley, the enemy is himself a white European male, Stuart and aristocratic in his politics, French by education, Scot in blood and soil. Not only does Scott endow the Highlanders with wildly primitive manners and geography, but he must also distance them in time by setting the novel in a distinctive past, "'Tis Sixty Years Since." Scott's ventures in creating a fearsome, menacing enemy-a portrait such as the genre of adventure-romance might bequeath him--out of a rel- ative paucity of exotic material perhaps risks much more in terms of fic- tional art than Kipling, in his turn, wagers. But, in contrast to the insular world of Waverley, the cultural universe of Kim dazzles and enchants us in its knowledge and comprehension of the rich ethnic, geographic, religious and linguistic diversity of turn-of-the-century India. Sophisticated in its command of the conventions of realism, Kim intends both senses of the verb to comprehend: figuratively, to understand and literally, to grasp. The author's competent mastery of that world is manifest in the fluid, facile adaptability of his central player, who introduces us to and informs us of the myriad wonders of that foreign world. Kipling and Kim are both better prepared to meet the challenge of representing that foreign world to its English readers than is Scott; Kipling knows more and commands more about the world of empire and the world of narrative. Likewise does the</page><page sequence="18">180 N T Empire reflect this state of august omniscience. And, when studied along the biographical time-line of the Empire depicted in these two novels, then to command knowledge of the alien resounds as the gravest and most im- perative lesson. Recall that in Waverley, in the childhood of the genre as it were, ignorance can still absolve; but when we open Kim, we hear Col. Creighton say, "There is no sin so great as ignorance. Remember this..." (Kim 7:167).23 By Kipling's day, then, the conventions of novelistic real- ism carry a warrant not only to enchant, but moreover a duty to inform. As we have seen, the facile wizardry of fiction allies the generic plot of the bildungsroman with the form of adventure-romance, and produces an artistic vehicle uniquely suited to exploring the mysteries of the alien cul- tures, of obtaining knowledge of the other. Yet after all this exploration of the novels' various codes for the development of Empire, it is ironic to finmd ourselves looking into the books themselves for information, enlight- enment, and knowledge. For, as we saw earlier, both novels question the value of a bookish education, though they are naturally dependent on this same literacy. Instead, they favor refinement by fire, trial and error, the school-of-hard-knocks, painful experience. And what is the realistic novel-be it Romantic or late Victorian-if not a vicarious adventure, an imaginary confrontation with danger and violence, a readerly game? Notes 1. Kipling Kim 8:195. Rudyard Kipling's novel will be quoted from Kim (New York: Penguin Books, 1987 [1901]), and Walter Scott's from Waverley, or, 'is Sixty Years Since (New York: Penguin Books, 1972 [1814]).

Arthur Conolly in the 1820's to denote the theater of espionage between the English East India Company and Imperial Russia over territorial interests in Central Asia. The lands at stake encompassed modern Afghanistan, Pakistan, northern India, and the several Asian republics of the Former Soviet Union. The development of intelligence and cartography in this campaign is likened to the Cold War of the late-twentieth cen- tury, largely clandestine and covert. However, there were several bloody clashes that took place, not overtly between the Russians and British, but between these looming imperial forces and local native governments that lay in the regions in between; in par- ticular, Britain suffered embarrassing defeats in the First and Second Afghan Wars</page><page sequence="19">Le grand jeau and the Great Game 181 (1839-1842 &amp; 1878-1881). In the khanates that are now part of Aghanistan, the British and the Russians strategically occupied cities in bluff and anticipation of any move by the respective imperial power. See Hopkirk, The Great Game: The Struggle for Empire in Central Asia. An informative electronic resource, designed by Larry Lambert, in- cludes historical background and parallels to the twentieth-century conflict in Afghanistan (1979-1989), The Great Game ([website]users.deltanet.com/users/ Ilambert/public_html/great-game.html, copyright Larry Lambert [no date]); it is a use- ful starting point, but is inconsistently documented and carries an evident partial agenda. Until it became known as a specific label for this phase of history, "the great game" circulated in political jargon long before Scott and Kipling record it here in the eigh- teenth and nineteenth centuries. Its sense as "spying" derives from its figurative sense of a game as a plot or strategy-and is not to be confused with another "great game" recognized in English usage, namely, golf; Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed., s.v. "great" and "game." 3. Glossary: chain-man, the bearer of the measuring chain in surveying; sahib, a respect- ful title used by Indian natives in addressing an Englishman or other European (="Sir"); gaberlunzies, a licensed class of beggars, given alms through Scottish nobles in return for prayers for royal welfare and the State; OED, 2nd ed., s.v. "chain," "sahib," gaberunzie". 4. Because control of commodities, trade routes and economic resources lay at the heart of European interest in India, it is not surprising that training in commercial skills and marketing would be included among Kim's lessons. The Great Game was a political and ideological theater to be sure, but it was also an imperial gamble.

Franco Moretti compares the conservatism of the English bildungsroman to notable European examples of the genre, in The Way of the World. I define the adventure-romance genre synthetically, indebted respectively to Mikhail Bakhtin's generic chronotope, to Northrop Frye's romance mythos, and to Georg Simmel's notion of romance as being contiguous but separate from mundane, quotidian time: see Bakhtin, "Forms of Time and of the Chronotope in the Novel," in The Dialogic Imagination and "Bildungsroman," in Speech Genres and Other Late</page><page sequence="20">182 N T Essays; Frye, Anatomy of Criticism; and Simmel, "The Adventurer" in On Individu- ality and Social Forms. As Mary McCarthy details in her essay "Novel, Tale, Ro- mance," the term "romance" takes on several identities. In Waverley alone, it con- notes first, a literary movement associated with Romantic poetry and often descriptive of Edward's imagination; second, a medieval literary tradition of knight- errantry that Cervantes parodied; and third, a marriage plot and the vacillations of eros, as argued by Margaret Anne Doody in The True Story of the Novel. 6. Martin Green argues that Scott's and Kipling's novels stand as tokens of cultural re- pression of the thought of empire, that is, as a reassuring fictional placebo, in Dreams of Adventure, Deeds of Empire. Edmund Wilson's "The Kipling that Nobody Read," explains the author's work as a personal repression, or an acting-out of the author's own past childhood traumas, in The Wound and the Bow. Georg Lukhcs' discussion of Scott in The Historical Novel has been, of course, widely influential for interpreting Waverley as a "mediocre" anti-hero set against the inexorable tide of history, as has Alexander Welsh's treatment of this same issue in The Hero of the Waverley Novels. 7. Freud's treatment of child's-play as exertion to mastery, or a fort-da game, derives from his essay, Beyond the Pleasure Principle (London, Hogarth and the Institute of Psycho-analysis, 1961). 8.

Similar lit- erary events have been described as Joycean "epiphanies" or as Benjamin's "messianic spark"--only I would want to clearly emphasize the immanent and profoundly non- transcendental dimensions of chronotopic literary moments. 9. According to Byron Farwell, public education in Britain was designed to inculcate a sporting ethic in preparing recruits and officers towards a "manly Christianity"; see Farwell, Armies of the Raj: From the Mutiny to Independence, 1858-1947, Michael Rosenthal, The Character Factory: Baden-Powell's Boy Scouts and the Imperatives of Empire, and Graham Dawson, Soldier Heroes: British Adventure, Empire, and the Imagining ofMasculinities. 10. Bakhtin coined a specific term for this familiar kind of character-awakening, namely "the chronotope of the threshold" ("Discourse in the Novel," in Bakhtin 1981, p. 248); this chronotope is thoughtfully elaborated in an article on Henry James' novels by Lisa</page><page sequence="21">Le grand jeu and the Great Game 183 Eckstrom, "Moral Perception and the Chronotope: The Case of Henry James," in Bakhtin in Contexts. 11. See ostranenie in Victor Shklovsky, "Art as Device" in Theory of Prose (Elmwood Park, IL, Dalkey Archive, 1990 [1917]) pp. 1-14; Freud's version of Shklovsky's es- trangement, the unheimlich, is explored in his essay, "The Uncanny." Georg Lukkcs' famous reading of this episode emphasizes Waverley's alienation from the overwhelm- ing motives and sweeping causality of history (Lukics 1962). 12. I am deliberately recalling the language used by Sir James Frazer from his discussion of magic in The Golden Bough, I (London, Macmillan and Co., 1911-1915), pp. 52-219. 13. Again, I borrow the term "device," priem, from the title and topic of Skhlovksy's im- portant essay (Shklovsky 1990 [1917]). I would merely underline the many meanings of the word device that are relevant to this discussion: first, as a tool, trap, or snare; second, as a plot or strategem; third, the bearings of a coat-of-arms; and fourth, the technique of estrangement, of ostranenie, in Shklovsky's sense. 14. The coat-of-arms heralds the man, and Scott famously puns with the title page of his novel as proxy for the book's blazon, shining with the blank purity of a tabula rasa, in his introductory Chapter 1 (Waverley 1:33-34). 15. The discredited nineteenth-century solar mythologist Max Miiller is the origin of the theory that archaic Western deities came to be worshipped as anthropomorphic gods once their names had devolved philologically from their original, elemental Indo- European meanings; for instance, Sanskrit Dyaus, meaning sun, sky, air, light, bright- ness, comes to be Zeus/Jupiter of the Greco-Roman pantheon, and the personified vestige of an ancient solar religion that revered many natural and cosmological ele- ments in order to secure good harvest. See Miiller, Selected Essays on Language, Mythology, and Religion, I (London: 1881) 617-623. 16. For the application of the tropes, metaphor and metonymy, to the study of narrative, see Roman Jakobson, "Two Aspects of Language and Two Types of Aphasic Distur- bances," in On Language. Although he phrases it in the terms of the Russian Formal- ists rather than Jakobsen's, Holquist defines the chronotope as an intersection offab- ula and syuzhet: "Chronotope is the indissoluble combination of these two elements" [emphasis author's] (Holquist 1990, p. 113). The chronotopic axis that Holquist de- scribes can then usefully substitute for the language of metaphor and metonymy in the work of Jakobson.</page><page sequence="22">184 1 N T 17. The meta-representational resonances of this passage are legion, but among them I note that the painter Raeburn, a contemporary of Scott, made portraits of the author and his family; see Edgar Johnson, Sir Waiter Scott: The Great Unknown. Further- more, the painter Raeburn claims kinship among those artists knighted by George VI, who, in his promotion of Scott, was the first English monarch to grant a baronetcy to a writer(Johnson 1970, p. 1135). 18.

S.v. Glossary, note 3. 21. Hopkirk documents several of the ruses of agents and pundits (native spies), explain- ing much of the theatrical wizardry behind Kim. Some of the preferred disguises were that of a holy-man, a Buddhist pilgrim such as Teshoo Lama, or a Himalayan trader; other likely identities were neutral European professionals, such as an Italian or French physician or veterinarian, whose skills would be of so much value to local set- tlements that it would outweigh the risk that they might be commercial or military spies. Canny observers of local cultures, the British put all the accessories of native dress to work for their purposes of cartography and intelligence-gathering; for in- stance, the rosary beads and prayer wheels of the Tibetan monks proved useful, in the first case, as counters for recording the paces and distances that the disguised agent had traversed, and in the second case, as a storage case for a compass in the prayer wheel (Hopkirk 1994, pp. 91-98; 125-126; 330-332). 22. Kim toys with the Eastern sense of merit, understood as "acquiring karma"; but here I stress the Western sense, as in "meritocracy." Said takes another view of the relationship of the imperial subject and the natives; in his argument, both sahib and native are humbled and subjected to the ruling power, but the sahib, unlike the colonial subaltern, enjoys the freedom of choosing his domi- nator, in "Pleasures of Imperialism," pp. 167-8. 23. The consequences of the lack of information, especially regarding terrain and the allies and ideological disposition of the ruling khans, was disastrous for both British and Russian armies over and over again. Oftentimes, in the missions to Khiva, the Oxus</page><page sequence="23">Le grand jeu and the Great Game 185 River, and Bokhara, for example, these European expeditions were the first ever to set eyes on these regions (Hopkirk 1994, pp. 16-20; 100-105).
