<plain_text><page sequence="1">D. H. Lawrence's The Plumed Serpent: The Dialectic of Ideology and Utopia Donna Przybylowicz The humanist attempt to appropriate and canonize certain authors only succeeds by repressing undesirable elements in their works. An interesting case of such selectivity and valorization can be found in the manner in which F. R. Leavis and T. S. Eliot choose to treat the works of D. H. Lawrence. Leavis ignores the fascist and misogynist aspects of his works, while Eliot dismisses him because of his work- ing class origins and lack of tradition. Curiously, Lawrence embodies the gestalt of both critics: the liberal humanism of Leavis and the darker fascist tendencies of Eliot. In their criticism, both Eliot and Leavis wage an assault on in- dustrial capitalism and reinforce the notion of tradition and the organic society, the latter of which they portray as a mythical and historical rather than a practical and efficacious solution to the contemporary ills of their world. Both manifest an agreement in some of their basic attitudes on culture, the past, and the mechanized character of modern civilization, yet they reveal antithetical ways of working out these beliefs. Leavis and the Scrutiny group were representative of the moral thrust of a liberal humanism that focused on the importance of the in- dividual and the intersubjective realm. Initially, such an approach was not as reactionary as the contemptuous anti-democratic, anti-liberal, and anti-individualistic authoritarian views of Eliot. The fascist 289</page><page sequence="2">characteristics that Lawrence shares with Eliot are ignored by Leavis in his reconstruction of the novelist as a liberal humanist. These two contradictory veins of thought co-exist in Lawrence and must be ex- posed through a symptomatic reading of his work, through an examina- tion of the dialectic of ideology and utopia in the text. The Plumed Serpent is particularly appropriate, in this respect, for it deals most dramatically with these conflicts within Lawrence-on the one hand, the desire for an organic society, freed from industrial capitalism's destructive treatment of the individual and, on the other, the need for a community of mindless creatures ruled by the "dark gods," by authoritarian leaders advocating impersonality and "blood con- sciousness." Rene Wellek identifies the New Criticism's "belief" in "a philosophy of history" with that of T.S. Eliot: There used to be once a perfectly ordered world, which is, for instance, behind Dante's poetry. This world disintegrated under the impact of science and skep- ticism. The "dissociation of sensibility" took place at some time in the seventeenth century. Man became increasingly divided, alienated, specialized as in- dustrialization and secularism progressed.- This reactionary lament, which brings to mind Lukacs's repudia- tion of the "schizophrenia" of modernist literature and his preference for the totalized world of the nineteenth-century bourgeois novel, re- quires the reinstitution of such a "unified" universe and centered self and involves a rejection of a technological and mechanistic civilization. In his writings, Eliot espouses an organic society rooted in the past, but, unlike the liberal humanism of Leavis and the Scrutiny group, who emphasized the primacy of the individual and the intersubjective quality of art and creativity, it is one in which the individual must relinquish his or her being to an impersonal order. Eliot is apparantly searching for redemption and transcendence, for a resolution of middle-class liberalism and its conscious values and mores through the production of a sensuous language consisting of images that would approximate those primeval levels of a collective unconscious and its ahistorical, static archetypes and universal symbols, arousing "swarms of inar- ticulate feelings" "from below the intellect" and suggesting "a net- work of tentacular roots reaching down to the deepest terrors and desires."2 Such a dismantling or deconstruction of consciousness sup- posedly would provoke in the reader a sense of identity in physical sen- sations. According to Eliot, this process restores a masculinity and toughness to language in that it situates all experience in concrete bodi- ly responses. Such activity is communal and collective and not fixated on individual egotistic emotions and reactions. In a similar vein, Lawrence states, "It is not your brain that you must trust to, nor your will-but to that fundamental pathetic faculty for receiving the hidden waves that come from the depths of life, and for transferring them to the unreceptive world. It is something which happens below the con- 290</page><page sequence="3">sciousness, and below the range of the will-it is something which is unrecognizable and frustrated and destroyed."3 Since for Lawrence "the unconscious is the creative element,"4 he criticizes mental con- sciousness for its mechanizing effect of ideas, and thus does not ex- pound a view that gives the mind a dominant role in the functioning of the psyche. Lawrence's argument emphasizes the necessity of following the complex path of the unconscious and disposing of the notion of an integrated, whole self in order to establish the impersonal, spontaneous "dark gods," the creative life force that is epitomized in the fascism of modernists like Pound. For Eliot all crises of a capitalistic post-war society of class- conflict could be transcended by ignoring history and replacing it with myth-a process of salvation and rejuvenation, manifesting images of death, resurrection, and fertility, whereby human beings would perceive their commonality, their basic identity. In Lawrence's The Plumed Ser- pent this kind of attitude results in the creation of ancient myth and its transformation into a proto-fascist religion that evokes a defense and valorization of nature, of the primitive and instinctual forces in man, and of an agrarian and pseudo-feudalistic social structure. All of this proves to be an idealistic solution in that only the past values of an animistic religion offer the groundings for future transcendence. However, unlike Lawrence's portrayal of a revitalizing return to past paganistic ritual in The Plumed Serpent, Eliot proposes a "unified religious-social code of behavior" that is based on the "idea of a Chris- tian society."5 "Literary criticism should be completed by criticism from a definite ethical and theological standpoint."' Both Eliot and Lawrence, although they use radical modernist techniques, manifest a basically reactionary view of life and history. The reader may perceive a similarity in Eliot's and Lawrence's gut reactions to their world. However, Eliot apparently has no sympathy for Lawrence's ideas and writings, which he feels have no moral or social value and manifest no discipline in their composition, no critical judgment, or, to put it most damagingly, no evidence of "tradition." Naturally, in Eliot's opinion, this was all due to Lawrence's proletarian background, which he emphasizes was morally, educationally, and spiritually barbaric: Lawrence suffered "from a lack, not so much of information, as of the critical faculties which education should give, and an incapacity for what is ordinarily called thinking," a "lack of in- tellectual and social training." He is therefore an example of the "crip- pling effect upon men of letters of not having been brought up in the environment of a living and central tradition."7 Eliot feels that art and literature expose the given condition of society: "their decay may always be taken as a symptom of some social ailment to be in- vestigated."8 In other words, the lack in the quality of artistic produc- tion is based on the impoverished state of the society's culture, which is caused by the disintegration of "tradition." F. R. Leavis, on the other hand, tries to save Lawrence from this vituperative attack by fitting him into an organic and living tradition (DHLN). Instead of seeing the necessity of rooting Lawrence in a coherent, cohesive upper or middle class Christian society in order for 291</page><page sequence="4">his work to have legitimacy, Leavis proposes that the author's real historical situation and his rich cultural background are based in English provincial working class life. Identifying the fictional depictions of society with the author's own experiences, Leavis asserts that Lawrence's cultural environment was homogeneous and organic, although he does clearly recognize "the confrontation, the interpenetra- tion, of the old agricultural England with the industrial" in the writer's works (DHLN, p. 322). However, instead of a dialectical examination of this dynamic conflict, Leavis's criticism presents a static viewpoint, a privileging of the past organic community as the nucleus of that tradi- tion which influenced Lawrence most significantly, even with its subse- quent disintegration and displacement by the mechanistic, dehumanized, and supposedly culturally barren world of modern in- dustrial capitalism: What we have lost is the organic community with the living culture it embodied. Folk songs, folk dances, cotswold cottages, and handicraft products are signs and expressions of something more: an art of life, a way of living, ordered and patterned, involving social acts, codes of intercourse and responsive adjustment, growing out of immemorial experience, to the natural environment and the rhythm of the year.9 Leavis laments the loss of a sense of community, the laborer's lack of touch with the environment, and the movement toward a mechanical uniformity. In attacking the inhumanity of a technological world, Leavis champions the idea of an organic society. Rather than attempting to change the former, he tries to elude its dehumanizing effects and philistinism by valorizing the notion of a dynamic living sensibility, without which modern civilization would atrophy and die, and by nostalgically praising the idealized totality of a pastoral past and subse- quently avoiding any direct confrontation with the exploitative reality of such an order. For him organic societies are a romantic myth against which the oppressiveness and cultural devastation of a dismal mechanized life are measured. Sounding like Lawrence and his criti- que of the disintegrative consequences of industrialization, Leavis states "The great agent of change, and, from our point of view, destruc- tion, has of course been the machine-applied power. ... it has destroyed the old ways of life, the old forms, [and] involve[s] standar- dization and levelling down outside the realm of mere material goods."'" His concern is with the cultural effects of the machine: that is, with the manner in which it influences taste, emotional responses, and social values. His reaction to the modern world, as embodied by America, also echoes Lawrence's attitudes in The Plumed Serpent: Today's America: the energy, the triumphant technology, the productivity, the high standard of liv- 292</page><page sequence="5">ing and the life-impoverishment-the human emp- tiness: emptiness and boredom craving alcohol-of one kind or another. Who will assert that the average member of a modern society is more fully human, or more alive, than a Bushman, an Indian peasant, or a member of one of those poignantly primitive peoples, with their marvellous art and skills and vital in- telligence?" Earlier, Leavis had negative responses to some of Lawrence's writings on past civilizations (Mornings in Mexico and Etruscan Places), but here he seems to have changed his opinions. He feels that America represents the conditions of modern life: its technology and "inhumanly complex machinery" has caused "social and cultural disintegration" and "has incurred a progressive debility of consciousness and of the powers of co-ordination and control-has lost intelligible memory and moral purpose."12 In other words, man has become the tool of this dehumanizing machine. Leavis is unable to render a political alternative to this system and instead only talks about a spontaneous creative life force and shows how a commercialized society has lost connection with the source of lived sensuous experience and concrete language, both of which manifest a wholeness that has been historically displaced. Like Lawrence, Leavis is against extreme rationality, the destruc- tive aspects of industrialization and technology, the atomization of the individual and his or her society, the secularized and mechanical response to life, the abstract reduction of human values, and the equalizing of all men and women, an act which supposedly suppresses their unique differences. He says that what Lawrence "inveighs against is the misuse of the mind that makes it an enemy of life. He exposes and inveighs a great deal, because that misuse is the distinctive mark of our scientific-industrial civilization. ... . the mind, mental con- sciousness . . . have been cut off from the well-head and from the cen- tres of living power. It is with thought . . . Lawrence sets about rescuing life from this inner mechanization."'3 "Industrial civilization, with the power to mechanize what lives in it or by it" threatens the human quality of "creativity . . . that can draw on the source that lies deep down,"14 which, as he states in terms of Psychoanalysis and the Unconscious, has a religious basis: here Lawrence offers a solution to the world's malaise. Leavis finds in Lawrence an affirmative attitude to life and a religious/spiritual concern in restoring cultural strength to a modern world bereft of it, in recognizing "a sense of the life of the universe flowing in from below the personal consciousness."'15 Unlike Eliot, his commitment is not to Christianity, but to a Lawren- tian idea of religion, a communion, a recognition of "the living connec- tions between man and the extra-human universe."16 In this respect, his humanist/religious viewpoint is like that of Lawrence. Leavis sees Lawrence as part of a living tradition, as believing in the importance of culture, history, critical intelligence, education, and the civilizing forces of the age. However, in this way he ignores 293</page><page sequence="6">the other side of Lawrence-his "repudiation of mind in an extreme of abandonment to frenzied sexuality and the Dark Gods" (DHLN, p. 150). Leavis feels that Lawrence, in Psychoanalysis and the Un- conscious, represents "the conditions of health and wholeness in the psyche": "The power of recognizing justly the relation of idea and will to spontaneous life, of using the conscious mind for the attainment of 'spontaneous-creative fulness of being,' is intelligence." (DHLN, p. 310). However, in this essay, Lawrence focuses on a criticism of the mechanizing effect of mental consciousness and does not propose a philosophy which gives the mind the primary function in the workings of the psyche. Leavis emphasizes the notion of the complementary role that the critical intelligence plays in the artistic process, but Lawrence shows that "the unconscious is the creative element" and that one must follow its meanderings rather than privilege the role of the whole psyche: For the whole point about the true unconscious is that it is all the time moving forward, beyond the range of its own fixed laws or habits. It is no good trying to superimpose an ideal nature upon the unconscious. We have to try to recognize the true nature and then leave the unconscious itself to prompt new movement and new being-the creative process.17 Leavis's view of such total valorization of the unconscious would be negative, for he is not interested in the mystical Lawrence, the Lawrence that wanted to experience a oneness with the cosmos. He refuses to recognize the contradictions within the author: There is no profound emotional disorder in Lawrence, no obdurate major disharmony: intelligence in him can be, as it is, the servant of the whole integrated psyche. It is the representative in consciousness of the com- plex need of the whole being, and is not thwarted or disabled by inner contradictions in him, whether we have him as artist, critic, or expositor. It is intensely active in his creative writing: we have on the one hand the technical originality of the creations, and on the other their organic wholeness and vitality. (DHLN, p. 77) For Leavis, Lawrence's poetic and lyrical qualities are used to render a unity of life, an intimacy of blood consciousness, which he denies links the author to the "dark Gods," to the valorization of instinct/body over intelligence/mind, of primitive forces over civilized tendencies. Unfortunately, Leavis needs to deify Lawrence and thus projects his own liberal humanism onto the author who cannot be exclusively perceived in these terms. Ironically, Lawrence embodies aspects of both Leavis's and Eliot's views of culture and life. It is also strange that Leavis saw Eliot's criticism of Lawrence as unjust and elitist, yet he 294</page><page sequence="7">failed to see the similarities between the two in terms of their focus on the "dark" forces. In The Plumed Serpent Lawrence criticizes the decline of man's inner essence and of the organic and cohesive community in the face of commercialization and technological innovation. He idealistically describes the old world of the Aztec Indians as possessing the beauty, ritual, rhythms, and forms of a totalizing and organic society, while the exploited and weary modern Mexico can no longer be perceived in such aesthetically pleasing terms-its culture has been corrupted for cen- turies by Western influences, its art is ugly, political, and crude, and its vitality is non-existent. Therefore, a historical and dialectical view of Lawrence's depiction of Western society as a whole shows not an organic environment but one composed of conflict and contradiction- between the past life based on agricultural production and a strong sense of community and the emergent culture based on industrializa- tion and alienation of the individual, all of which become a part of the ideological structure of his art. If we examine Lukacs's method of ideological criticism we will see parallelisms to the ideas of Lawrence, Leavis, and Eliot in terms of a need to posit a totality and the value of organic form whereby the work is perceived as an ordered historical whole, in this way revealing the complex and comprehensive truth about society's structure and meaning.18 If a work of art does not measure up to the ideal model Lukacs sets up, it is faulted for incompleteness. He privileges realism above all other literary forms, which is a conservative stance in that the work's authenticity and value depend on how accurately it mirrors a particular historical epoch. Countering Lukacs's elevation of realism as the superior form and his denunciation of modernism as the product and sympton of reification is Brecht's and Benjamin's perception of the innovations of modernism as revolutionary acts. Against a nostalgic organicism, a closed system of totalities, they commit themselves to open forms that expose contradiction and difference.19 Finally, as Jameson and Eagleton point out in their discussion of Althusser and Macherey, any literary text is heterogeneous, "schizophrenic," inter- nally dissonant and self-divided; it is not an organic whole. Rather than superimposing an ideological false totality on a work of art, Althusser and Macherey employ a "symptomatic" analysis and look to the discon- tinuities and self-contradictions in the text for the privileged content. Only when the "unified" formal elements are deconstructed and shown as contradictory can the reading be seen as dialectical.20 With a symptomatic reading one can lay bare the contradictions and conflicts within Lawrence's works, both on the stylistic/syntactic and thematic/semantic levels. In terms of the latter, all Lawrence's works reveal an antagonism between the impulses toward individualism and community, both of which are underscored in The Plumed Serpent by the tension between the manifest theme of the establishment of a new healing religion and a communal society and the latent suppress- ed content, which reveals the elitist, racist, misogynist, and proto- fascist attitudes underlying the author's cosmology. The desire to im- merse oneself in the community and the antithetical need to withdraw 295</page><page sequence="8">in order to cultivate one's inner capabilities are both humanist solu- tions, one showing the insistence on the social character of all ex- perience and the other the infinite potentialities of the liberated, autonomous self. As Eagleton mentions, such individualism is "an ap- plication, indeed, of organicism to the individual self, which becomes wholly autotelic, spontaneously evolving into 'wholeness' by its own uniquely determining laws."21 This plentitude of being is the focus of Don Ramon's animistic religion in The Plumed Serpent, where totality is achieved through the metaphysical absolute of the "morning star" that mediates between and involves a momentary merging of the binary oppositions of mind/blood consciousness. Lawrence suggests that such a phenomenological unity of experience can be attained only .under certain conditions. Perceiving the decentering and disintegra- tion of the individual as a negative situation, he attributes this to the subject's experience under capitalism. The bourgeois belief in the ideology or illusion of the centered self or of personal identity, which is the basis of the humanist ethical tradition and reflects the cohesion and solidarity of a class or group, is countered by Lawrence's descrip- tion of the dissolution of psychic unity in modern man: You mustn't look in my novel for the old stable ego-of the character. There is another ego, according to which action the individual is unrecognisable, and passes through, as it were, allotropic states which it needs a deeper sense than any we've been used to ex- ercise, to discover are states of the same single radically unchanged element. ... I don't care about physiology of matter-but somehow- that which is physic--non-human, in humanity, is more interesting to me than the old-fashioned human element-which causes one to conceive a character in a certain moral scheme and make him consistent. The certain moral scheme is what I object to.22 Although recognizing the schizophrenic fragmentation of the self and showing a subconscious fascination for disintegration and mechanism, Lawrence nevertheless depicts his characters' goals as the search for a wholeness of being, which he extends to the unification of the col- lective as well, thereby ideally resulting in a rebirth into a new totality where the communal form of society can triumph over the older forms of bourgeois isolation and the monadic autonomy of the subject. So even though Lawrence's views reveal aspects of an idealized bourgeois individualism and its liberal values, they also represent a revolt against the atomization of man and the reified society produced by industrial capitalism. Yet the idea that man can achieve authentic being by acting decisively in the world (praxis) turns only into static vitalism in The Plumed Serpent, for there are no practical goals sus- taining contact with the universe, nor any real collective purpose- everything dissolves into a personal desire for power. Lawrence's philosophy in this book contains an identity theory, a yearning for 296</page><page sequence="9">transcendent being; the withdrawal into inwardness, impersonality, and unconsciousness that he advocates is really a retreat into a mythical, demonic repetition that denies historical change. The rhythms of this world are ritualistic and seem to omit any decisive social or political action. Through such a reductive approach, based on intuition and in- stinct, Lawrence seeks to puncture the reified world and discover eter- nal essences via a phenomenological exploration of various states of consciousness. However, intuition cannot be valorized as an absolute manifestation of cognitive existence, as the means to discover a univer- sal life force or to break through to underlying levels of reality. To ex- perience life as an uninterruptible flow as Lawrence's characters do when in one of their mystical states is to ignore historical change, to absolutize the present which minimizes the importance of action. For example, in his Quetzalcoatl hymns Don Ramon recognizes the cor- rosive effects of imperialism, yet he rejects practical solutions and seeks to eliminate subjectivity and individuality under a false totalism that privileges amorphous, static psychological states of unconscious "knowing." Whereas Don Ramon removes himself from direct involve- ment in the political/pragmatic problems surrounding the propagation of his beliefs, Cipriano and his Aztec storm troopers espouse action and discipline and expeditiously promote the spread of Ramon's fascist religion and his longing for a society that emphasizes individual separateness rather than human community, mystical impersonality rather than personal communion. As Eagleton suggests about Lawrence's late works, such a social order "rejects the 'female' principle of compassion and sexual intimacy for the 'male' principle of power."23 The Plumed Serpent predicts the ascendency of the dark races, the Christian god dying and making way for the resurrected, revitalized gods of the Aztecs and of blood-sacrifice. Lawrence states in an essay that "The reign of love is passing, and the reign of power is coming again. The day of popular democracy is nearly done. Already we are entering the twilight, towards the night that is at hand." Power for Lawrence is "manifold"; it can be physical, racial, mental, ethical, spiritual, mechanical, military, or political, "all true manifestations of power, coming out of the unknown," "unlike the millionaire power, which comes out of the known forces of human greed and envy."24 The power that Don Ramon and Don Cipriano possess is obviously considered positive in Lawrence's eyes, although it may seem fascist to the reader. Therefore, in his fiction Lawrence seems constantly torn be- tween the valorization of individual autonomy, that is, the maintenance of one's isolation and separation from others, and the desire for social integration and immersion in a community. He tries to resolve this con- tradiction through the philosophical constructs of binary oppositions- dichotomized entities of mind/body, light/dark, spirit/soul, sky/earth, male/female-which represent the locus of ideological closure of Western societies. The conceptual limits of this ideology fluctuate bet- ween a proletarian sympathy and nostalgia for the sensuous, primitive energy that is found in the "mindless" and passive Indians and a petty- 297</page><page sequence="10">bourgeois elitism, idealism, and intellectualism that are manifested in his heroine's willful consciousness and fierce individualism. However, Lawrence tries to transcend or contain these oppositions by holding them in dialectical tension through the concept of the "morning star" in The Plumed Serpent or "star-equilibrium" in Women in Love, both of which reflect a balancing of power, mind, consciousness, spirit, ac- tivism, and individualism vs. sensuality, passivity, unconsciousness, soul, mindlessness, and impersonality. The "morning star" functions as the superego, the basis of the synthesis of ego and id, the con- sciousness and the archaic aspects of the psyche. Through the basic semes of Lawrence's philosophy or cosmology we can structure his "libidinal apparatus" and perceive the permutations in the shape of his psychological and political fantasies that reveal the contradictions which the text desires to control or master. Thus both Lawrence's ideal of individualism and of social reconstruction are humanist conceptions, one based on the organicist notion of the natural evolution and development of the isolated creative self, and the other on the liberal ideology of utopian socialism and a hatred of industrialization and mechanization. Lawrence seeks to over- come alienation by projecting an idealistic vision, a reconciliation of subject and object in the ephemeral meeting in the "morning star," which allows commingling yet maintains individuality. However, the narrative remains trapped in a static binary opposition rather than open- ing into the historical dynamic of class antagonism, of dialectical in- volvement. As Jameson suggests, in order to capture the layered meanings within a text, it is necessary to identify its re- actionary/"ideological" and its progressive/"utopian" aspects: we can extrapolate and apply this theory to Lawrence's novel, The Plumed Ser- pent, in that it expresses both capitalism's reification of life and the increasing fragmentation of the individual psyche and its world as well as a utopian compensation for the dehumanization of man's being in that it offers the possibility of some more authentic existence (PU, pp. 281 ff). In 1915 Lawrence devised his idea of Rananim, the establish- ment of a utopian colony that would involve the abolition of money and would be "communism based," dependent on "integrity of character" and the "complete fulfillment in the flesh of all stong desire." The members would be an exclusive group: "We will be aristocrats, and as wise as the serpent in dealing with the mob. For the mob shall not crush us or starve us nor cry us to death. We will deal cunningly with the mob, the greedy soul, we will gradually bring it to subjection." Although believing that "there must be a revolution in the state,"25 Lawrence also shows his more elitist, sexist, and authoritarian vision of a socialist government: Let the working classes be working classes. That is the truth. There must be an aristocracy of people who have wisdom, and there must be a Ruler: a Kaiser: no Presidents and democracies. . . . And women shall not vote equally with men, but for different things. 298</page><page sequence="11">Women must govern such things as the feeding and housing of the race. And if a system works up to a Dic- tator who controls the greater industrial side of the national life, it must work up to a Dictatrix who con- trols the things relating to private life.26 Lawrence wants to limit the power of the working classes, main- tain the division of labor between the sexes, and create an organic state with an elected monarchy. As Holderness states, "The romantic ideology had swamped the liberal-democrat, to produce the vision of a quasi-fascist corporate state-more like National Socialism than democratic Socialism."27 Because of Lawrence's disgust over the atrocities of the war and his disillusionment with the roles labor, capital, and aristocrat are playing in this "game . . . of destructive evil," he attempts to reject history by going into exile, to "flee from the chaos and the orgy of ugly disintegration which is to come," to "go away from England for ever" and establish his Rananim by himself. He feels that through his fiction he will be able to "live apart from this foul world which I will not accept or acknowledge or even enter."28 Thus Lawrence's construction of a utopia in The Plumed Serpent and depic- tion of Ramon's Quetzalcoatl religion could represent a projection of his desire to remove himself from a world he saw as corrupted by politics and capitalism and the desire for power. In The Plumed Serpent, Lawrence exposes his basically anti- democratic and anti-socialist tendencies. It appears that Lawrence could not recognize the proletariat nor the Indian peasant as capable of any historical initiative; he could only see them as needing to be controlled by a dictatorial leader. For example, Ramon and his followers have fascist leanings; both he and Cipriano in their misogyny and nega- tion of sexual love espouse an impersonality and a desire for power that supposedly do not violate individual autonomy. Ramon, who (along with the heroine, Kate Leslie, and the impersonal, philosophic voice of the narrator) reflects varying aspects of Lawrence's conscious beliefs and suppressed desires, exposes his thirst for power: "There is no such thing as liberty. The greatest liberators are usually slaves of an idea. . ... You only change one sort of domination for another. All we can do is to choose our master."29 Ramon and Cipriano see themselves as living deities who bring about "the renewal of the old, terrible bond of the blood-unison of man, which made blood-sacrifice so potent a factor in life." The individual life is insignificant since it is ultimately reabsorbed by the "great blood-being, the god, the nation, the tribe" (PS, p. 417). The concept of the ressentiment of the have-nots for the haves is at the center of Ramon's criticism of society: he speaks of "Politi- cians and socialists and so forth, surcharged with pity for living men, in their mouths, but really with hate-the hate of the materialist have- nots for the materialist haves: they are the Anti-Christ" (PS, p. 205). He rightly denounces the "fathomless lust of resentment" he perceives around him (PS, p. 132) and the exploitation of Mexico by foreign capatilists (PS, pp. 74, 75, 132) "those parasites on the face of the earth" 299</page><page sequence="12">(PS, p. 239), through their technology and business interests, and he acknowledges that men are "not manufactured goods, to be inter- changeable" (PS, p. 247). Yet Ramon ultimately admits that he "detest[s] and despise[s] masses of people" (PS, p. 248); "mere per- sonal people" and "contact filled him, too, with disgust," for he wants to meet them on another plane "without intimacy" (PS, p. 250). This feeling of revulsion and sense of aristocratic superiority are qualities he shares with Kate, who admits that she likes being a goddess and being treated with absolute respect. Ramon, who also enjoys his status as a deity, theorizes about the possibility of supermen from every na- tion forming "a Natural Aristocracy of the World," yet he stipulates that the races must not mix, except for the "flowers," who can commingle, not to "rise beyond their race" but to be "cosmic" (PS, p. 246). In speaking of the natives, Ramon is condescending and seems only to emphasize their intellectual limitations and inability to com- prehend modern technological innovations; this attitude involves both a denigration and a reinforcement of their "primitiveness" and ultimate- ly aims at denying them access to knowledge and power. His plan for a utopian society does not involve any practical solutions, any economic, political, or educational changes, but simply advocates an atavistic return to a ritualistic past, an escape that offers no remedy for the poverty and hopelessness of the Indians. Relegating the natives to subservient positions, he apparently wants to keep his worshippers innocent, simple, and untouched by Western ideas. He stresses that one must obtain one's manhood and womanhood, but fails to show how this is going to change the iniquities of the present society or deal with the pressing demands of capitalist/imperialist nations. Will dissolv- ing one's consciousness "in the greater, dark mind which is undisturbed by thoughts" and is "timeless and worldless" (PS, p. 192) provide an answer? One tends to be cynical about Ramon and his decadent obses- sion with ornate custom-made peasant clothes-the money for his Quetzalcoatl ceremonial wardrobe must in some way come from the peons whose mode of life Ramon's religion is supposed to revitalize. It is peculiar that Lawrence chooses a Mexican of Spanish descent, a landed proprietor, to be the leading God, the one with intellect, charisma, inspiration, and Western education, who is supposedly wor- thy of being worshipped. However, Lawrence is not being ironic in mak- ing the privileged Mexican, one of European heritage and white blood, the successful exploiter of others. The novel shows the Indian sunk in poverty, ignorance, and apathy; exploited by landlords, brainwash- ed by the Catholic church, and bereft of moral focus. Ramon does not propose new housing or schooling, better food, or redistribution of the land-everything will be rectified simply through the new mystical vi- sion of the living universe. Such an approach might provide man with a sense of his own dignity, but will not solve the pressing political and social problems destroying the country. Ramon is ultimately revealed as a god without compassion, a conservative dictator who shows no pity even toward his hysterical and dying wife, treating her as he does the peasants, as an object that should reflect his own desires and not as an autonomous subject with 300</page><page sequence="13">independent needs. Ironically decrying her willfulness, he is blind to his own overwhelming egotism that no training in the impersonal and unconscious swooning of his mystic states can destroy. He remains basically non-human, merely a figurehead for an irrational religion that prides itself on throwing aside the devouring humility and pity characteristic of Christianity. What it offers does not seem to be any better-the gods of power and blood-sacrifice do not ultimately seem more appealing than the gods of charity, selflessness, and guilt. Lawrence's statement in Fantasia of the Unconscious could have been spoken by Ramon: "For the mass of people, knowledge must be sym- bolical, mythical, dynamic. This means you must have a higher, respon- sible, conscious class: and then in varying degrees the lower classes, varying in their degree of unconsciousness. Symbols must be true from top to bottom. But the interpretation of the symbols must rest, degree after degree, in the higher, responsible, conscious classes."30 Lawrence seems to recommend illiteracy for the working and peasant classes and to suggest that the "conscious" ruling sector control their responses and actions of the latter by dictating the symbols and laws which the ignorant masses must unequivocally and automatically in- ternalize and obey. The power of this Quetzalcoatl cult is absolute: Ramon sets himself up as the high priest and Cipriano administers the necessary military coercion. Somehow this religion fails even though it promises a revitalizing relationship between man and nature through the mystical reawakening of the individual's sensual centers that have atrophied as a result of industrialization and mechanization. The estranging powers of Ramon's lapse into unconsciousness and his subsequent increasing impersonality do not seem to provide the salva- tion they apparently promise. Lawrence represents the suppression of sensuous human activity in both the Westerners and the Indians in decadent Mexico City. The egotistical and bourgeois Americans are portrayed as alienated and isolated monads who can only passively contemplate their own actions not only in terms of commodities interacting according to their own laws, but also in terms of the objectified constructs of their own minds: as LukAcs states, "Just as the capitalist system continuously produces and reproduces itself economically on higher and higher levels, the structure of reification progressively sinks more keenly, more fatefully, and more definitely into the consciousness of man." What one notes is the "artificially abstract" nature of this "new objectivity," this "second nature" man inhabits in modern capitalism, which is particular- ly obvious in a scientific laboratory: "The experimenter creates an ar- tificial, abstract milieu in order to be able to observe, undisturbed, the untrammeled workings of the laws under examination, eliminating all irrational factors both of the subject and object. He strives as far as possible to reduce the material substratum of his observation to the purely rational 'product,' to the 'intelligible matter' of mathematics."31 Thus "reality, what we apprehend through our senses is understood only in the form of the object of contemplation, but not as sensuous human activity."32 (However, although Lawrence's characters exemplify the dehumanizing and deadening effects of reification, I am not imply- 301</page><page sequence="14">ing that Ramon's cult of blood consciousness is equivalent to the lat- ter notion of "sensuous human activity" or praxis-his religion, as is quite obvious, is hierarchical in terms of race, sex, and class and does not resemble a utopian socialist structure in any way.) Kate's compa- nions, Owen and Villiers, for example, are "Americans, picking over the garbage of sensations, and gobbling it up like carrion birds" (PS, p. 23). Constantly struggling to fill the emptiness of an empty, mechanical life, the Americans are birds of prey, symbols of their imperialist homeland, absorbing experience like machines and needing constant stimulation and excitation. Villiers is coldly observant and scientific: with a "bright abstract look of pure democratic anger" he glowers at a Mexican crowding him as at a "beetle-like intruder" (PS, p. 7). Owen too is after a thrill, and the narrator ironically calls him a "great socialist" who hates "common rowdiness" yet scrutinizes the Mexican "other" as "he might look at a dog with rabies" (PS, p. 8). Critical of her friends and tired of her old way of life, Kate Leslie, who often expresses Lawrence's own biases and libidinal fantasies, also displays the same hatred of the mob and the same elitist tendencies as Ramon. The cosmic and philosophic voice of the narrator and the point of view of the heroine/central consciousness merge in their hatred of the "brutal and violent," "degenerate" "mob authority" at the bullfight (PS, p. 5). Owen and Villiers as well feel only disgust and contempt for the Mexicans and their aping of Western bourgeois respectibility. The Europeans and Americans reduce the Mexicans to the status of "mongrels" (PS, p. 6) who reflect the "squalid evil" of a country that is "oppressive, like the folds of some huge serpent" (PS, p. 15), and they also ridicule the bullfighters as "fat-hipped girls" (PS, p. 11), "eunuchs," "women in tight pants" (PS, p. 8), posessing a decadent effeminancy, and lacking dignity or stature. All of the American and European characters speak from a posi- tion of self-satisfied moral superiority, and discuss the possibility of regeneration in Mexico in a cynical manner: they dislike the Labor move- ment in the country since it advocates and practices the levelling of class distinctions, that is, it favors the proletariat and hates upper class foreigners (PS, p. 32). Yet, ironically, in a contradictory moment of "altruistic sensitivity," they also condescendingly criticize the corrup- tion of the Labour Party for ignoring the plight of the Indian peasants, but the question arises as to whether the situation of the latter was better before the revolution, as the archaelogist, Mrs. Norris, implies. Most likely it was better for the Westerners and those of European des- cent but not for the Indians. They also self-righteously condemn the Mexican character for not liking "honesty and decency and cleanliness. They want to foster lies and crime. What they call liberty here is just freedom to commit crime. That's what Labour means" (PS, p. 33). They all speak as if America and Europe had exclusive possession of such high-minded qualities. Kate admires the "ponderous power of blood," the "helplessness," and "profound unbelief that was fatal and demonish" in the Indian, yet she believes that "all the liberty, all the progress, all the socialism in the world would not help him. Nay, it would only help 302</page><page sequence="15">further to destroy him" (PS, p. 47); "When you got these dark-faced peo- ple away from wrong contacts like agitators and socialism, they made one feel that life was vast, if fearsome, and death was fathomless" (PS, p. 101). In other words, the natives must be kept away from politics since they are supposedly too simple to deal with complex issues-for Lawrence and his characters their strength and brilliance lie in their dark sensuality, which needs to be reawakened by their Aztec heritage and gods. The American and European outsiders give no credit to the positive efforts of the Labour party: for example, the latter's dissolu- tion of the large haciendas and its parcelling out of bits of land to the peasants is contemptuously dismissed from an elitist point of view. Unable to accept the idea of equality between the races or classes, the narrator sarcastically says of the Indian Ezequiel when given his bit of land: "He was a gentleman in his barbarism" (PS, p. 141). In addition to such socio-political issues, the art of the new Mex- ico also becomes the object of the narrator's and characters' criticism, which emphasizes that, since the revolutions, the authority and tradi- tion of the Western aesthetic ideal had been anarchically overthrown and displaced by the mechanical, futuristic representation of the Mex- ican murals: the figures are idealized, flat, "symbols in the great script of modern socialism . . . figures of the pathos of the victims of modern industry and capitalism. ... symbols in the weary script of socialism and anarchy" (PS, p. 47). Her taste is offended by such "crude and ug- ly" works, and she does not identify with the frustration and indignities they represent. From her sense of European superiority she says that this art "bores" her (PS, p. 49), which is a convenient way of distanc- ing herself from the political and social realities underlying it. However, she does show some awareness of the problems of the country: after asking a Mexican university professor about the government's lack of concern for the twenty-one million poverty-stricken Indians and then noting his own prejudiced and elitist position (he says "they are too ignorant" [PS, p. 49], implying that they cannot be helped) she acknowledges that the people perpetrating the revolution are "half Spaniards full of European ideas" who are only interested in egotistical- ly asserting their own beliefs and concerns and thus have no real com- passion for or desire to help the lower classes. Yet she does become involved in a religious movement that seems to have little of the latter altruistic impulses: Ramon and Cipriano are revolutionaries who simp- ly want to affirm their own individual power. So we see that The Plum- ed Serpent fluctuates between an adamant denunciation of the reformist philanthropists and socialists, and an equally narrow-minded indictment of the poor natives who cannot be saved or elevated in society. In The Plumed Serpent, all Western values, whether manifested in the Europeans and Americans or in the Mexicans, are criticized. The Christian ethic of "charity: that cruel kindness" (PS, p. 297) is derided through Carlota, Ramon's wife, who alternately wants to worship her husband or to control him with her will. Like Ramon she is wealthy and of pure European extraction, and in Kate's opinion is thus "very different from the usual stout, over-powdered, ox-like Mexican matron" (PS, p. 153), although she has that "doglike finesse of gentleness" (PS, 303</page><page sequence="16">p. 154) characteristic of Latin American women. The ascetic Carlota represents the masochistic quality of Western morality and the slave mentality of Christian ethics. Ramon's egotistic obsession with his Quetzalcoatl religion and Carlota's fetishization of her Christian philan- thropic intentions are efforts to lose the individual self, but both are also shown as grandiose visions intended to solve the dilemmas of totality. Instead of seeing Carlota's acts as altruistic and well-meaning, Ramon dismisses them as eccentric mania and as robbing her of her natural vitality. Both are obsessed with an ethical abstraction-one by Christian charity and obligation, and the other by the need to free the collectivity from inhibiting passions. However, even though Carlota has espoused Christian acts and beliefs, she too is the victim of aristocratic insolence and subconsciously believes in her innate superiority. What Lawrence ultimately hates about Western religion is its destruction of man's vitality, for it makes him passively accept his present misery in the hopes of a better after-life. These visions of an organic community are beset with all kinds of contradictions. Ramon's plans are for a utopian and mythical semi- feudalistic societal formation, one that would be homogeneous, rural, and peasant. This nostalgic and atavistic return to a preindustral period is juxtaposed to the mechanized and commercial aspects of a capitalist society that the novel basically suppresses and ignores. The Indian com- munity that the narrator presents and Kate confronts has been victimiz- ed by imperialist forces for many centuries and as a result has lost its natural vitality. The natives are shown as illiterate, passionate, and un- conscious, leading a life that is predominantly intuitive and instinctive. For them all knowledge is attained through the senses rather than the intellect. So although they lead a daily life that Kate perceives as sor- did, dirty, crude, and ugly, necessitating a confrontation with the materialist world of money, labor, scarcity, a world created by industrial capitalism that perpetuates the class divisions of the Creoles (those born in the New World of Spanish descent), the mestizos (of mixed Spanish and Indian blood), and the pure-blooded Indians, they ex- perience a full existence elsewhere, their real being inhabiting a dark world where life is mysterious and based in pure sensation. The Plumed Serpent maps out antagonistic realms. First it delineates the world of crude materialism where the individual's ex- istence is ruled by the "cult of the dollar" (PS, p. 40), by property and possessions, by mechanism and abstraction. This is the world found in Mexico City or in the everyday lives of the rural natives. In the urban landscape there is the complete victory of industrial forces, a total an- nihilation of the past and of a "mythic" organic totality by the alienating influences of capitalist/imperialist development or "exploitation." Se- cond, the novel comments on how the mechanical principle has entered the rural Indian community not through industrialization but through the natives' inability to free themselves from apathy and inactivity, for they perform their daily tasks automatically and unthinkingly. Thus Mex- ico is shown as divided; it is not harmonious nor homogeneous. Various characters suggest that the reason for the hatred and dissension in the country is due to the mixed blood. Toussaint, who is of Spanish, French, 304</page><page sequence="17">Austrian, and Indian heritage, is against the "half breed": for him it is acceptable for the Europeans to intermarry across national lines since the blood is homogeneous, thus insuring a certain continuity of tradi- tion, whereas for the Indians and whites to mix is a calamity. For him the "moment of coition" is the determining factor, and if the "people of mixed blood" have been "begotten in greed and selfish brutality" over the centuries, then it is no surprise that Mexico is such a seething combination of opposing passions. Therefore, he advocates that the country should be left for the Indians and that the whites and mestizos should leave, for even the days of the Aztecs and of blood sacrifice are preferable to the inaction and apathy of the present. His resentment about foreign influence and imperialist domination and exploitation is accurate enough, but when he blames this bad "mixed" blood for the reason why Mexicans eat food with no nourishment, live in homes that "a dog would be ashamed of," and "lie and shiver with cold," he misperceives the real problem as genetic rather than economic. Kate also naively and perhaps maliciously questions why they have so many children, not even considering the unavailability of rudimentary knowledge about birth control for the lower classes. She is constantly applying her own standards of conduct and cleanliness to them, perceiv- ing them as copulating animals who exercise no self-control. Kate is always ambivalent about the Indians; her moods fluctuate back and forth so suddenly that one paragraph will contain opposing feelings. The natives fill her with "tenderness and revulsion" (PS, p. 73) and are "fearsome and so appealing" (PS, p. 46). On the one hand, she admires their vitality, "passionate warmth" (PS, p. 107), "richness of physical being" (PS, p. 59), and mystical "intense semi-abstraction, a gleam . . . of the morning star. . . that watches between the night and day, the gleaming clue to the two opposites." Yet on the practical level of daily contact, this "gleam" turns to the "silence" of "vacuity, arrest, and cruelty" (PS, p. 87). They are depicted as animals, unwashed, lazy, "reptilian" (PS, p. 73), "brutish, evil, cold and insect-like" (PS, p. 72), "primitive" (PS, p. 131), "slightly imbecile" (PS, p. 212), manifesting a "demonic effrontery" (PS, pp. 87-88) that is embedded behind their "monkey look of subjection and fear" (PS, p. 131). They have in Kate's opinion "no centre, no real I. Their middle is a raging black hole" (PS, p. 36), an "uncreated centre, where evil and insolence lurked" (PS, p. 73). Whereas the natives' positive attributes seem to center on their unconscious vitality and instinctual superiority, the denigrative elaboration of their subhuman characteristics is insidious and fills most of the narrative space. Kate perceives the Indian as "part-thing, which knows its power to destroy the purer thing," "a half-being" (PS, p. 103) who "understands soul, which is of the blood. But spirit, which is superior, and is the quali- ty of our civilization, this, in the mass, he darkly and barbarically repudiates" (PS, p. 113). On one level, Lawrence would disagree with his heroine's statement in that he would perceive blood consciousness as being superior, yet there are many indications in this novel that this superiority can only be attained by those white characters who achieve a symbiotic balance between the mind and the body, which is not the 305</page><page sequence="18">case with the Indians who remain locked within a primal darkness they cannot transcend. Kate perceives them as innately inferior, as unable to rise out of their servant status: The dark races belong to a bygone cycle of humanity. They are left behind in a gulf out of which they have never been able to climb. And on the the particular white man's levels they will never be able to climb. They can only follow as servants. While the white keeps the impetus of his own proud, onward march, the dark races will yield and serve, perforce. But let the white man once have a misgiving about his own leadership, and the dark races will at once attack him, to pull him down into the old gulfs. To engulf him again. (PS, p. 145). The latter happens to be the fear and fantasy of the white colonist. Kate criticizes the Indians for their inertia and laziness: they are "a people without the energy of getting on, how could they fail to be hopelessly exploited" (PS, p 146). However, if this is true why does she fault them for their "resistance" (PS, p. 146) to her orders. She demands that they actively construct their lives yet her hostility toward any ag- gressive or assertive behavior place them in a double bind. The Indian primitive is mainly praised for his privileged instinctual responses: Kate seems to reserve her admiration primarily for the male's sensuality, physical attractiveness, and unconscious mysteriousness. The Quet- zalcoatl movement shows the Indians as unthreatening to the whites, as returning to their "proper" sphere of religious ritual and mystical pagan practices; in this way, they are not competing with the other powerful classes in that they are not obtaining education, money, or property. In other words, if they maintain their primitive ways, they are doing what they do best. In Cipriano Kate finds an extension of these qualities she observes in the natives. Mainly attracted to Ramon's "pure sensuali- ty" (PS, p. 181), she finds Cipriano, who is Indian, more limited: "without Ramon, Cipriano was just an instrument, and not ultimately interesting to her" (PS, p. 407). Although we do enter the consciousness of Kate and sometimes Ramon, Lawrence renders Cipriano from an external vantage point: he often appears inscrutable, as a mass of passions, manifesting a "barbarian conceit" (PS, p. 78), "the heavy ebbing blood of reptiles in his veins" (PS, p. 62), a "touch of childishness . . . un- conscious maleness . . . so helplessly savage" (PS, p. 62). He is con- sistently represented in terms of a serpent and Ramon of an eagle-again the binary opposition of earth and air, body and spirit, syn- thesized in the image of the plumed serpent. It is Ramon with whom she identifies-"lnstantly Kate and he, Europeans in essence, understood one another" (PS, p. 36)-and not Cipriano whom she sees as an instinctual, mysterious, unknowable, and alien being. Although educated at Oxford, he is still presented as a superstitious savage deep- ly influenced by his Catholic upbringing and his dark primitive heritage. 306</page><page sequence="19">The narrator sarcastically states that Kate's resemblance to the Virgin Mary fulfills Cipriano's childhood fantasies: he is shown as a fool in his ecstatic worship of this "white-handed" goddess (PS, p. 67). She casts over him "the same spell that the absurd little figures of the doll Madonna had cast over him as a boy. . . . But once he rose from his knees, he rose in the same strutting conceit of himself as before he knelt" (PS, p. 78). So even though he manifests this subconscious adula- tion of women, he relegates them to an inferior place in the Quetzalcoatl constellation. Nothing can save him in the narrator's or Kate's view, for "his education lay like a film of white oil on the black lake of his bar- barian consciousness" (PS, p. 78). As the Aztec deity Huitzilopochtli, Cipriano is transformed into the god of death. Since as Cipriano he is a general in the military, it is appropriate that he becomes identified with a punishing god and is involved in the bloody executions of those who attempted to murder Ramon. As judge and jury he condemns the criminals, driving a knife into their hearts in a ritual reenactment of the Aztec sacrificial ceremony. Although Kate notices the "demonism," the "black, relentless power" that wishes to destroy the type of cerebral will of white civilization with an equally devastating and bloody solution, she absolves Ramon and Cipriano, for "they believed in their deeds, they acted with all their con- science" (PS, p. 385), which Lawrence does not present as a paltry justification for their actions but as an act of machismo and primeval energy. She sees in Cipriano an "intense blind ambition" (PS, p. 234), "impersonal, physical" (PS, p. 235); he could "not even conceive of . . . service to mankind. He saw only glory" (PS, p. 311-12). This kind of egotism she is careful not to attribute to the white Ramon, whom she envisions both as an inspirational spiritual and intellectual force as well as a sensually vital and attractive man. However, she only cares for Cipriano sexually, as an instrument of satisfaction and pleasure, for she explicitly states that she has little concern for any of his other activities: "What do I care if he kills people? His flame is young and clean" (PS, p. 388). Fascinated by the mysterious and inscrutable aura surrounding Cipriano, she is drawn by this same quality to the Quetzalcoatl religion and its symbol of the bird and serpent in which she feels a "confusion of contradictory gleams of meaning. .... Her Irish spirit was weary to death of definite meanings, and a God of one fixed import. Gods should be irridescent" (PS, p. 54). Kate's experience with Ramon and Cipriano allows her an escape from the friction of life into inner silence and a withdrawal from world- ly contacts. The days become "stretches of nothingness" (PS, p. 305), an experience of timelessness. After her marriage by Quetzalcoatl, desire disappears and she is "plunged in wan indifference, like death" (PS, p. 304). As Freud states "unpleasure corresponds to an increase in the quantity of excitation and pleasure to a diminution."33 This so- called Nirvana principle, which expresses a need for the tranquillity of inorganic nature, involves the removal of tension. The ideal of Thanatos, the object of the death wish or instinct, is something quite different from physical mortality: its aim is aphanasis, asexuality, the radical ex- tinction of the repetition of desire. This seems to be what Lawrence 307</page><page sequence="20">is striving for in the sexual consummation between Kate and Cipriano, which manifests no willful desiring, emotions, or "Personal or spiritual intimacy whatever." This mindless subterranean communion of the blood lacks the "spasms of frictional voluptuousness" and of "con- scious satisfaction," for what "happened was dark and untellable," "deep and hot and flowing," and Kate "could not grip it into one final spasm of white exstasy which was like sheer knowing" (PS, p. 421). Lawrence is straining for a nonrepressive re-eroticization of man's relationship to nature and to others in order to overcome aliena- tion, but the actual presentation of this need seems debilitating and sexist. The "phallic mystery" she experiences in her union with Cipriano is rendered through the usual histrionic Lawrentian metaphors: feel- ing the "tingling of his blood and the heavy power of the will," she aban- dons herself to the "supreme god-demon," with "passivity," and "prone submission" to the piercing "pliant column"; "his body of blood could rise up that pillar of cloud which swayed and swung, like a rearing ser- pent or a rising tree, till it swept the zenith, and all the earth below was dark and prone, and consummated" (PS, pp. 308-09). Yet the impersonal and often unconscious quality of the experience freightens her, and she feels he refuses to recognize the "tiny star of her very self," (PS, p. 386), her unique being: "To him, she was but the answer to his call, the sheath for his blade. . . . As an isolated individual, she had little or no significance. . . . She was not real till she was reciprocal" (PS, p. 386). Of course, this supposedly applies to the male as well as in that it takes both sexes together to make a soul, "the Morning Star, emerging from the two" (PS, p. 387). Yet one feels that the gesture of submission is all on the female's part. As a result, Kate questions the idea of in- dividuality as possibly being an illusion, for she senses that perhaps by oneself one is "starless and fragmentary" (PS, p. 388): only "in the mechanical world" is "the individual machine . . . effectual"; in "the vivid world" of Quetzalcoatl it is "an illusion and falsification" (PS, p. 388). But it appears that the identity she assumes as a goddess just answers subliminal fantasies and does not render a true selfless and unegotistic entity, for Kate likes the adulation she gets from the natives, especially the sensual males whom she believes worship her because of her "nobility" (PS, p. 436). One thus really wonders what the new state of being is and how it differs from the old egoistic and power- hungry desires. Ramon, Cipriano, and Kate may see themselves as gods and goddess, but what does this mean? Ultimately, Kate refuses to relin- quish her sense of power in a relationship and her "isolated individuali- ty" and self-sufficiency, nor does she really like the idea that "In the blood" she and the Indians "are undifferentiated." She hates "this overbearing blood-familiarity" (PS, p. 416) and reasserts her difference from the natives. The notion of the collectivity appalls her, for She had been brought up with the English-Germanic idea of the intrinsic superiority of the hereditary aristocrat. Her blood was different from the common blood, another, finer fluid. ... They [Indians] would defer to her spirit, her knowledge, her understanding. 308</page><page sequence="21">They would give her deference, and a sort of grudging reverence for this. She belonged to the ruling races, the clever ones. But back again they demanded her ac- quiescence to the primeval assertion: The blood is one Blood. We are one blood. It was the assertion that swept away all individualism. (PS, p. 416-17). She does not want to be "in immediate contact with all these men and all these women" (PS, p. 417). So it is obvious that the oneness is at another level than intellectual equality. Losing her identity as Kate Leslie and becoming Malintzi, a Quet- zalcoatl diety, puts the finishing touch on Kate's sexual fantasy. Immer- sing herself in the dark fulfillment of repressed and unconscious desires, she is able to release herself from her past, from the restric- tions of the reality principle and any ego boundaries. She ignores the rational, moral, political, and economic issues of modern Mexico and submerges herself in the indulgence of her fantasies. The only way she can unleash her subliminal desires about the "other" is to detach herself from her former state of consciousness so she need not recognize her union with Cipriano as part of her ordinary existence: "Surely it would not be herself who could marry him. It would be some curious female within her, whom he did not know and did not own" (PS, p. 235). She wants his "dark, exultant sort of passion," yet he seems "almost repellent" to her (PS, p. 235). The loss of self in a heightened state of sensual awareness allows all kinds of repressed activity to resurface. Even at this point, Lawrence emphasizes that, after her "enlightenment," Kate still remains the upper middle class white woman who does not know what to do to occupy herself. At the end, she admits that she is a "fraud" (PS, p. 444) and is simply amusing herself with this whole experience-she can play at being "other," at being an Aztec goddess, for she knows that she can leave when it becomes too boring. The strategies of containment that one discovers in The Plumed Serpent are thus embodied in these offensive and caricatural portrayals of the politics and people of Mexico. Lawrence presents us with the Western stereotyped notion of what the dark races are like-lazy, dirty, resentful, covetous, irresponsible, and aimless creatures who have their "positive" qualities, namely a superior instinctual and subterranean life. The "other" must return to a primitive, animistic state; he must not at- tempt to transcend his situation by seeking education, and technological or economic improvements. Progress can only be im- plemented by a man of European extraction and training who can magically bring the natives enlightenment. Ramon is thus qualified mainly by his hereditary superiority to be a leader and most important- ly a prophet. The whites may turn to the dark race for a revitalization of their sensual pole, yet they have no desire for any further exchange with the Indian. He is condemned by his genetic deficiencies to remain an ignorant servant, to maintain a semi-feudalistic relationship to a lord who determines his destiny. Ramon's utopian vision, even with its anti- capitalist and anti-industrial critique, is basically elitist and contempt- uous of the lower classes and other races. Similarly, the natives are 309</page><page sequence="22">successfully stereotyped and standardized by Kate. She identifies the positive figures among the Mexicans with the aristocratic party, and the Indians with the more equivocal and primarily savage and blood- thirsty characteristics. The revolutionary movement is mainly in the hands of Ramon and his idealistic beliefs, whereas the childlike, ador- ing, yet violent, Cipriano is the one who carries out the nasty and necessary bloody aspects of the rebellion. But, as Kate says, Cipriano is merely the agent and is thus not important. So naturally we do not take Lawrence's depiction of the Indians at face value; instead we regard it as a manifestation of the ideologemes that constitute the colonizing nations' fantasies about the dark races. For it shows how the whites attempt to suppress their fears by project- ing all sorts of evil onto the sensuous and unknowable "other." Lawrence and his protagonist, Kate, who is a privileged center belong- ing to another class and race yet remaining a participant in this social world, are both alienated from their country and class and are fascinated and obsessed with the dark "other." They are therefore both caught between two different sets of values. This relationship between Lawrence and his fictional creation is what Jameson calls libidinal in- vestment or authorial wish-fulfillment, a "form of symbolic satisfac- tion in which the working distinction between biographical subject, Implied Author, reader, and characters is virtually effaced" (PU, p. 155). In this situation, Kate's and the narrator's attitude to the natives is a combination of revulsion and fascination. In The Plumed Serpent Lawrence correctly portrays the crisis of Mexican society as resulting from reification and social fragmenta- tion, yet he repudiates revolutionary political change and wants to main- tain class divisions of some sort. His idealistic world is organic, sacred, and mysterious: here the relationship between man and nature is to become utopian through the instinctive knowledge of physical contact and intuitive sensuous awareness. Such a religion can provide the unalienated development of human potentialities and the establishment of an organic community where the collectivity can figurally represent its own group identity and unity. But such a symbolic expression can also be distorted, a theory of mystification and false consciousness, as in Ramon's cult. In this utopia socio-political practicality is avoided. Since capitalism has successfully dissolved all older forms of collec- tive relations, it is curious that Lawrence feels one can establish an organic, natural, permanent situation that can ignore the world as historical and as subject to change and the influence of socio-political and economic forces. However, although Lawrence does not call for social and political revolution he does require the evolution of the individual's inner being and questions the whole problem of being-in-the-world and the nature of social totality. He is involved in containment strategies which strive to resolve societal conflicts and liberate supressed desires in an ideal vision. From the latter fetishized structures are derived the ideological obsessions of racism, misogyny, hatred of democracy and socialism, stereotyped presentation of otherness, a polemic and didactic stance toward his mystical religion, and an infatuation with fascist tenets. 310</page><page sequence="23">Lawrence, like his heroine, Kate, fears the levelling of class differences, and socialism and communism appear as the process that will com- plete this trend in which the humanistic/bourgeois subject will lose his privileged status. He portrays an atavistic return to a past and semi- feudal society, that valorizes the charismatic and strong personality as a leader who cannot become a standardized member of an equalizing society. Finally, he defends the dominating Ramon and the in- dividualistic Kate against the onslaught of the masses. Lawrence attempts to show that this hypothetical, mythical world of Quetzalcoatl is the natural and authentic embodiment of the soul of man, whereas Mexico City is the conquered arena of Western capitalism and imperialism and is a perversion of the latter. He con- trasts the affirmative values of the Quetzalcoatl religion to the dehumanizing, mechanistic, and corrupt qualities of western civiliza- tion and its exploitation of underdeveloped countries. However, he does not take into account the complexity of native life, for in The Plumed Serpent the Quetzalcoatl cult is based on an abstract and ideal totality of myth that Lawrence places in a remote and intangible past. His solu- tion thus is not an authentic response to the historical conditions and is not an act manifesting futural thrust. It is not, that is, a development of prior conditions. Lawrence perceives the central antithesis in Mex- ican society between human relationships and the economic infrastruc- ture as a static opposition rather than a dynamic contradiction that involves change and development. Because of this he presents us with a world that is dichotomized: the Indians live in a mythical and religious realm of the Quetzalcoatl that is removed historically from the in- dustrialized and capitalist environment. Projecting such a fantasy and metamorphosis of the human soul onto a foreign "other" yields a naive solution in that it does not examine the complexity of the interaction between the economic structures of society and the material and cultural impoverishment of the people. Lawrence does not envision any sort of relationship between the Indians and the capitalist powers. In- stead, he chooses Ramon to be the one to fulfill the historical role of bringing the natives a sense of their own dignity. Through Ramon's en- couragement of mystical, artistic, and communal activities he will achieve a totalized community in which the people are in harmony with their environment. In this way, the nature of the psyche is changed, which is desirable and necessary. But Lawrence's proposals at this point stop and offer no practical solutions as to how such a return to older modes of production can be accomplished and maintained in a world that necessitates confrontation with other modes of production. The vision becomes personal and, although progressive in some respects, remains basically reactionary. For the natives, even with their innate physical sensuality and sensitivity, are finally portrayed as having no intellec- tual or rational capabilities that would allow them to make choices about or changes in their condition. They are allowed to express their so-called real primitive nature in ancient ceremonies and rituals and are accor- dingly rewarded as good, obedient children for their cooperation by their rulers, Ramon and Cipriano. Because of this inadequacy, Lawrence sug- 311</page><page sequence="24">gests that they must be guided by someone superior, like Ramon, who fulfills the role of both artist, in that he is a visionary who imagines and creates a utopian future, and of the philanthropic feudal lord and deity, who controls their destiny and desires. The new society reflects a conflict between aesthetic appreciation, peace, and human dignity and a subterranean desire for violence, power, and death that is con- stantly threatening to erupt. The utopia is curiously established within the existing property relations, for Ramon does not relinquish his ha- cienda nor his role as lord-the mode of production remains predominantly feudalistic. According to Ramon's idealism this society should be built without struggle by all its members' cooperation, yet Cipriano ironically is the force that is to deal with all opponents in an expeditious and violent manner. Though promising a utopia, the Quet- zalcoatl cult will in reality culminate in a bloody religious war, which is predicted at the end of the book. As mentioned earlier, the opposing impulses in Lawrence are manifested in the syntactic/stylistic as well as in the semantic/thematic aspects of his works. To put it in Jameson's terms, the former is a pro- jected solution on the aesthetic imaginary level to a genuinely contradic- tory situation in the concrete world of everyday social life (PU, p. 225). In The Plumed Serpent we see the residual presence of older forms alongside the emergent modernist discourse: the generic discon- tinuities manifest the conflicting stylistic and semantic elements of romance, realism, impressionism, expressionism, symbolism, and myth. This sedimentation is reflected in the generic and syntactic layering of contradictory residual, dominant, and emergent forms and styles, and in the semantic representation of the commodity reification of capitalism coexisting in dialectical opposition with the power systems of precapitalist societies as well as with the most archaic divisions of labor in communal or tribal groups (i.e., the "Westernized" inhabitants of Mexico City vs. the "primitive" converts to Ramon's religion). By ex- amining the manifest and latent levels within the text one notices the residual "repressed content beneath the later formalized surface" (PU, p. 100. See also pp. 139-45, 213). This synchronic model of sedimenta- tion is particularly evident in the modernist paradigm in which one notices heterogeneous elements that possess their own idiosyncratic and contradictory ideological meanings. Therefore, one notes a tension and coexistence of several generic messages and sedimented ideologemes at work within The Plumed Serpent. Jameson sees modernism as a response to the increasing reification of modern society in that the fragmentation of the psyche and its world . . . opens up the semi-autonomous and henceforth com- partmentalized spaces of lived time over against clock time, bodily or perceptual experience over against ra- tional and instrumental consciousness, a realm of 'originary' or creative language over against the daily practice of a degraded practical speech, the space of the sexual and the archaic over against the reality- and 312</page><page sequence="25">performance-principles . . . of adult life, andof the growing independence of the various senses from one another.34 The modernist impulse is both ideological and utopian. On the one hand, it reflects and perpetuates such fragmentation of the psyche, the increasing subjectivization of individual experience, the atomization and disintegration of the community, the intensifying class conflicts, the reification of social life, and the strengthening of the industrial capitalist complex. On the other hand, it wishes to overcome such rationaliza- tion of life as well by examining the possibility and development of a new utopian and libidinal structure within the imprisoning existing society and is therefore an anticipation of some more authentic being- in-the-world that provides an alternative for the increasing dehumaniza- tion of modern life. And in the latter situation there is the valorization of myth, symbol, ritual, an archaic past, organic forms, individual iden- tity, intuition, and the repudiation of reification, industrialization, em- pirical being, and existing forms of a mechanistic society. In Lawrence this is revealed in his privileging of man's sensual responses and criticism of the rationalizing functions of the mind. Jameson also notes that it is in "the context of the gradual reification of realism in late capitalism that romance once again comes to be felt as the place of narrative heterogeneity and of freedom from that reality principle to which a now oppressive realistic representa- tion is the hostage. Romance now again seems to offer the possibility of sensing other historical rhythms, and of demonic or utopian transfor- mations of a real now unshakably set in place" (PU, p. 104). Romance finds its place in a work like The Plumed Serpent in terms of its projec- tion of a nostalgic, utopian harmony and totality, a salvational yet static vision of history, the ideologemes of good and evil, and the "worldness of world" in which "the transcendental horizon of our experience becomes visible in an innerworldly sense" (PU, pp. 111-12). The "worldness of world" is shown in the natural imagery that represents historical or social phenomena: there is the demystification of the organic and an anthropomorphic projection whereby human attributes are transferred onto the scenery or vice versa, which is characteristic of primitive animism and its awareness of the interpenetration of the spheres of man and nature. Lawrence opposes this to Western man's perception of life as composed of lifeless atoms and to the instrumen- talized manipulation of the individual and nature, which results in the objectification of the world. In The Plumed Serpent the natural imagery describing the landscape takes on qualities of the social condition or of man's psyche or of animals, and humans take on attributes of nature (wind, serpents, water, etc.). Mexico is "reptilian" (PS, p. 68), the peo- ple are described as "mongrels," "monkeys," "reptiles" (PS, p. 68) with "collective insect-like will" (PS, p. 103). The Church's roof is a "crouching animal" (PS, p. 45), its "twin towers . . . holding up its two fingers in mockery" (PS p. 217); the lake has "filmy" (PS, p. 94) "spermlike water" (PS, p. 89), the "lymphatic milk of fishes" (PS, p. 94); the "blue-ribbed mountains of Mexico" are like "some grisly skeleton, in the cage of his 313</page><page sequence="26">death-anatomy," for "Behind the fierce sun the dark eyes of a deeper sun were watching, and between the bluish ribs of the mountains a powerful heart was secretly beating, the heart of the earth" (PS, pp. 103, 106). The hostility of nature reflects the conflicting character of Mexico and its people: there is "No lovely fusion, no communion. No beautiful mingling of sun and mist"; instead it "suggested violence and things in chemical conflict" (PS, p. 213). The ideologemes of good and evil as embodied in the binary oppositions of self vs. dark other are ones that Lawrence tried to transcend with his metaphysics but fail- ed, for the subtext reveals the petrification of the categories of the valorization of Western superiority and the denigration of the foreign dark "other." The idea of a utopian realm offering salvation for the dessicated soul of man is finally shown to be a mirage. There is, as already observed, an impressionistic privileging and reification of the senses in Lawrence's scheme: he tries to express the process whereby the individual estranges himself from the world, brackets his everyday perception of life, and immerses himself in a realm where the usual conscious experiences of personal egoistic passions and emotions are exorcized and replaced by an impersonal attitude. The whole procedure has the phenomenological quality of a prolonged epiphany: the loss of awareness of one's surroundings, the swooning into unconsciousness, and with the return of consciousness a resulting defamiliarization of the world and a lapsing into an impersonal, detached state. This pure plenitude of being and the way it is achieved is describ- ed through the imagery and the privileging of the sense of touch and inner vision. The impressionistic passages describing the new life of the senses are also a response to reification; for the objects of the natural world are bracketed and there is the concentration on the reorganization of perceptual data, whereby the older unities are dislodg- ed and reconstructed in this utopian realm. Here, as Jameson observes, the senses become the master code, and libidinal gratification is sym- bolically restored to a world devoid of this experience (PU, p. 63). Lawrence's transcendent state of being is predicated on the dominance of the perceptual apparatus in that the latter recreates its objects through the process of bracketing ordinary experience, the dissocia- tion of meaning and cognition from the intuitive and sensory, and the transformation of the world into images. The fragmentation of the natural world causes the individual to search for some experience of inner plenitude that transcends the external conflicts, which is what both Ramon and Kate undergo in their meditative, ego-free trance. The latter situation also has expressionistic qualities in that the withdrawal has dreamlike characteristics and seems to fulfill some unconscious, unverbalized compulsions and fantasies, which is obvious in the caricatural and flat portrayal of the natives. Kate also suffers from un- predictable lapses and contractions of her world and experiences strange sleep-walking states in which her awareness of the external reality is tenuous. In The Plumed Serpent, the depiction of the loss of self and con- sciousness, as shown in the materialist concentration on the senses, transcends an individual inner monologue and represents a universal 314</page><page sequence="27">collective experience. The old stable centered self or ego no longer seems to function in these hallucinatory passages where the natural- fact-world is deleted and replaced by this uncontrolled flux of sub- conscious and sensuous elements. In these instances of unconscious knowing, the character undergoes the timeless objectivity of the lived present and a sense of psychic unity with the universe. Rather than perceiving time, on the one hand, as a mass of disparate, disjointed moments and of mechanical cerebral activity, of sheer intellectual or physiological stimulation that is characteristic of personal or subjec- tive experience, and, on the other hand, as the instrumentalized clock- time of an industrialized world, Lawrence's idea of temporality is measured by the natural rhythm of the drum rather than the clock, by the "membrane" rather than "metal":' It records the passage of time that is felt viscerally and collectively rather than intellectually and individual- ly. The experience is no longer personal and existential but universal and impersonal. Therefore, rather than ultimately grounding itself in the subjec- tive and solipsistic attitudes of a particular class or group, Lawrence's narrative reveals the dialogical dismantling of the hegemonic order of the dominant culture: a Lacanian language of the "other" exposes the ambivalence in Lawrence between adherence to middle and upper class values and a ressentiment against them, stemming from his own pro- letarian working class background. This conflict is at the basis of the heterogeneous and antagonistic discourses found in The Plumed Ser- pent. The text emphasizes the voice of the hegemonic class through Kate and her predominantly contemptuous view of the Indians while the opposing voice of the primitive culture is reappropriated and reinter- preted by her and Ramon in the mystical vision of the Quetzalcoatl religion. However, in reconstructing the non-hegemonic voice or sub- conversation in terms of its polemic strategy one deconstructs the dominant forms. Thus these interpersonal or intermonadic dialogues are based in the collectivity and show Lawrence's and his characters' efforts to conquer their sense of an inner ego deficiency or lack of identity. The surface language of the narrative is unable to capture the true experience or render the object in Lawrence's narrative. Rather than explain the deeper significance of the words and actions of his characters, analyze their feelings and thoughts, or even show them ex- amining their own cogitations and conversations, Lawrence attempts to interpret the quality of such interaction universally and externally in the form of impressionistic and figurative language that reveals the individual's inchoate inner struggle for coherence. This substitute for the impossible plenitude of a natural language, an illusion that can never be achieved, is the subconversation, a wordless struggle or interac- tion. Kate finds common everyday language no longer sufficient for individual expression and sees the mind as a mechanism reproducing itself ad infinitum in senseless, clich6d, conventionalized talk-it is an assertion of self and ego. This is why silence and a "wordless know- ing" are so important to both Kate and Cipriano. He discourages speech between them, and she also comes to hate the mechanical production 315</page><page sequence="28">of language. The alienating idea that the preexisting system of cultural representation (Symbolic order), into which the individual is inserted, produces and creates the subject upsets Kate, for in this situation the personal thoughts and languages are illusions and conventionalized formulae and preclude the uniqueness of the individual and his expres- sion. She sees people lost in this way, "Spinning a great lot of words, burying themselves inside the cocoons of words and ideas that they spin round themselves, and inside the cocoons, mostly perishing in- ert and overwhelmed" (PS, p. 103). Genuine life exists behind the dead surface of convention. In the ritualistic, impersonal, repetitious, and prophetic incantations of Ramon to which Kate succumbs, and in the depersonalized voice of the narrator we sense the trancelike numbness to surroundings, an estranging procedure where words are not suffi- cient to express real meaning and are only an insignificant cloak to wordless reality. However, Lawrence's text is not reduced to silence but attempts to recover a more authentic existence and to posit a new, unalienated, originary language in which preverbal or nonverbal events can be expressed, and these sentences are shown as pressing toward some organic yet inexpressible whole. The cosmic voice of Ramon in his hymns or the impersonal presence of the narrator is supposed to represent the collectivity-it symbolizes the utopian solution, while the voice of Kate fluctuates between, on the one hand, her adherence to hegemonic prejudices and her individuality and, on the other, her desire to immerse herself in the new religion and in the collective experience of the as yet non-hegemonic voice of the natives. Of course, the latter cult is subverted by Ramon's desire for power and becomes simply a reinterpretation of an archaic order. This fragmentary tendency reflects the major conflict in Lawrence between individualism and community and between elitism and the progressive reconstruction of society. Although the liberal humanism of Leavis can be perceived in Lawrence's critique of industrial capitalism and of the dehumanization of modern man and his loss of a living connection to his environment, the organic community he privileges and celebrates is more akin to Eliot's vision of such a world, which emphasizes myth, the collective unconscious, and experience anchored to physical sensations. Lawrence embodies aspects of both Leavis's and Eliot's views of culture and history and is thus divided, on the one hand, between humanistic values and beliefs and, on the other, a fascist impulse toward authoritarianism, a fascination for the power of the "dark gods," and an obsession with a sadomasochistic sexuality. Unlike Leavis, who feels that tradition can be passed on since it is a creative activity and involves discovering new areas and directions, Lawrence is trying to rid himself of the restrictions of the past. Leavis apparently needs to deify Lawrence in these terms, but in perceiving this creative force in the author he ignores (or suppresses) the coexistence of misogynist, racist, and fascist tendencies which culminate in the novelist's dismissal of democratic structures and his valorization of subservience to an impersonal principle of totalitarian power. Such repression, one might add, is a typical feature of humanism and its process of canoniza- tion. If it is true, as Walter Benjamin suggests, that "There is no cultural 316</page><page sequence="29">document that is not at the same time a record of barbarism,"35 then what we see Leavis doing is suppressing the barbaric (fascist) side of Lawrence in order to elevate him into the humanist canon.
