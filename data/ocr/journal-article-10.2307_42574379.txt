<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LANGUAGE OF MORAL RESPONSIBILITY RICHARD W. DETTERING* The is to most maintain crucial that problem free and facing responsible "scientific human humanism" conduct is to maintain that free and responsible human conduct is possible in a universe of lawful and predictable events. To preach humanistic values, whether those of Erasmus, Voltaire, or Julian Huxley, would hardly seem worth the effort were men not free to heed the message and change their behavior accordingly. Of course a similar dilemma is encountered by any doctrine affirming deterministic principles, ranging from that of Calvin to that of Marx. What Wolfgang Kohler, in a book of the same title, called "the place of values in a world of facts" can be of significance only if we are able to make value decisions on our own power. Karl Mannheim has argued that any system of ethics requires some measure of unpredictability ; yet science as we have come to know it seeks prediction at every turn. To relate coherently the descriptive and normative disci- plines is, of course, an aim as old as the Greeks, but today the task presses on us in a new, frightening sense of Arma- geddon, with all possible extremes of the human outcome awaiting its completion. At this moment the undertaking tests some of our deepest assumptions about human activity - assumptions, surprisingly enough, on which the traditional arguments both for and against free-will have rested. Here the problem will be approached from a novel point of view. Satisfactory reasoning on this matter has been so wanting * Professor of Education and English, San Francisco State College.

XXIV, NO. 4 that even the most speculative attempts to analyze it should be welcomed. They could hardly becloud the picture more than it already is. I. Persons as Symbols Let the us time, look as at the human existentialists beings in have a different insisted, way. the Much modern of the time, as the existentialists have insisted, the modern scientific world has looked on people as it has looked on animals or things. Shall we pose another way of looking at them? From the Cartesian stimulus of " Cogito , ergo sum," which finger-pointed self-knowledge as the logical starting point for all knowledge, the Western rationalists and, later, the idealists built an epistemological model based on introspection. In the introspective situation, in which one is "aware of," is "con- scious of," or verbalizes about his own private self, there lies a kind of "knowing" uniquely different from the usual high school type of knowledge. With all phenomena (including the sensed parts of our own body), knowledge (as its name is used in our daily language) depends on the subject-object distinction. At the instant of knowing, the object is "alien- ated," as Hegel said, from the subject who knows it. Yet with introspective self-knowledge the distinction is not so clear. Here there is not the same degree of alienation, or even the same kind. Here the subject who knows is also the object which is known. However much a conventional epistemologist may claim that no knower can know himself qua knower at the moment he is doing the knowing (that at most he can know himself only as he was at some earlier time, and thus still can know himself only as an object which is distinct from his self which knows), there is still one un- deniable fact: that the object which is the self as known is both temporally and spatially (mnemonically and physically) continuous with the self that knows. This relationship is clearly quite different from those cases in which we know a street, a mountain side or the motor of a car. In these latter 420</page><page sequence="3">DECEMBER 1967 LANGUAGE OF MORAL RESPONSIBILITY instances what we know about is quite apart from us ; 1 this makes us say that the knower and the known are distinct enti- ties. But when we say that we know ourselves, or even a part of ourselves, how can we keep the distinction between the knower and the known so sharp? This problem is what philos- ophers have called the "egocentric predicament." If we modestly grant that we do not know ourselves in exactly the same way that we know rocks, trees, and stars, a further question may be asked. What other things might we, at least in part, know in somewhat the same way that we know ourselves - in a way in which what is known can be fully known only by some infusion of our self-knowledge? Certainly not the great mass of inorganic matter, nor even plants, or fish, or mammals. But what about other human beings? When we perceive another person, especially his face or voice, we do not attend exclusively to the physical prop- erties - (volume, rhythm, tone, shape, color, etc.) - as we do on hearing a clap of thunder or on seeing the face of an opossum. Rather, we concentrate on what he states or expresses by virtue of these physical properties. To use the term of Heinz Werner, we immediately infer an "inner life" beyond what we actually see or hear; it is this inference that makes our acquaintance with another person meaningful. We do not just experience other people - we read them or listen to them. More so, we read or listen into their behavior the private experiences of our own life. We regard them as honest, kind, sly, hostile, frightened, etc. Here our sense-data will include a curl of a lip, a squint of an eye, an inflection of a voice, all of which entice their particular response from us only when we attach our special meaning to them. At such times we are not likely to impute any meaning which we had not already given to our own similar curls, squints, and in- flections - as well as to those of our earlier acquaintances. Could it be that the mirror has been man's most important 1Of course there are many borderline cases in which the object we know may or may not be considered part of us, such as the parts of our own bodies. The clear-cut, extreme cases are here cited for the sake of emphasis. 421</page><page sequence="4">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XXIV, NO. 4 invention? Those phenomena we call "other people" are so important to us precisely because we are able to inject them with the memories of our own introspections. Here nomena comes which another we also question: apprehend Are in there somewhat any other the same phe- nomena which we also apprehend in somewhat the same way that we get to know ourselves and other people? The positive answer is: symbols . When we read or hear a sentence, acknowledge a gesture, salute a flag, or kneel before a cross, we once again do not focus on the sound, color, or physical outline of the stimulus. We simply ask: What does it mean? But we never see, hear, or smell the meaning - nor do we ever expect to. What the symbols mean to us is just what we put in them - neither more nor less. No word, nod of the head, or crucifix carries a meaning in its own being. Its meaning is a creation of our investment ; and what we invest in symbols is akin to what we invest in the author of the symbols, if, per chance, we are with him face to face when he is sending the same message. Don't we ever imagine that we are actually hearing a good writer articulating in a clear polemical voice as we read his convincing and transparent prose? Surely, we come to 'understand" both people and symbols in the same way. With both people and symbols, we respond not to the stimuli per se, but to the way those stimuli jibe with some cognitive scheme, which, for the lesson at stake, lies wholly within ourselves. If, then, we come to know ourselves, other people, and symbols partly by dint of introspection - a way not needed to know other physical objects - we can ask some still deeper questions. Can we now find some clues about human behavior from our studies of symbolism - clues quite irrelevant to physical, chemical, or zoological activity? Conventional mod- ern psychology and sociology have not even been prepared for such a suggestion. These disciplines have tended to look at human beings as objects - as physical or biological sub- stances - and have viewed their patent behavior as symptoms of underlying entities, laws, or forces, rather than as symbols or vehicles of meaning. This traditional scientific approach 422</page><page sequence="5">DECEMBER 1967 LANGUAGE OF MORAL RESPONSIBILITY can lead to a most outlandish error. To try to know or under- stand human personality symptomatically instead of symbol- ically is like trying to understand a speech by measuring its sound waves or a book by making a chemical analysis of its paper and ink. Here we can at least wonder whether the cur- rent behavioral sciences, in their passion for a human "astron- omy," are not mistaking symbols to be objects and meanings to be events. II. Our Projective Judgments of People If judgments it can be of agreed people that are more many like of our our most responses consequential to sym- judgments of people are more like our responses to sym- bols than like our responses to everyday objects and events, the next question is about the ramifications of this agreement. While we have seen that our responses to symbols involve a projection of introspectively determined meanings, this does not imply that our responses to symbols are all alike. The meaning of a symbol is found most directly within ourselves, but for some symbols almost all people in a given culture will find the same meanings, while for other symbols each individual will find very different ones. Symbol systems range from the completely rigorous, like mathematics, to which only one type of response is logically and socially acceptable, to the extremely flexible, like poetry, to which a wide variety of responses may be tolerated and even welcomed. Painting, sculpture, and music, in this respect, are more like poetry than like mathematics. And so is the symbolism of physiognomy and distinctively human behavior - expressions, gestures, intonations, posture, dress, etc. At both ends of the symbolic spectrum, what determines the re- sponse lies within the responder; but at the looser, "poetic" extreme the responder has far more responsibility for the meaning found inside of him. At the mathematical end, the symbols through their physical properties tend to direct one and only one kind of meaning to be given to them. But, in interpreting poems and people, we gain a greater degree of immediate freedom from the stimuli themselves. In judging other human beings, then, we often enjoy this 423</page><page sequence="6">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XXIV, NO. 4 ability to react optionally and "subjectively." Psychologically we are far more free to disagree with a public consensus about the motives and character of Mr. Jones than we are to differ with a consensus of mathematicians about the validity of a theorem by Mr. Jones. With regard to a theorem or scientific "fact" we go by the rule that one man's opinion is either right or wrong, but with poetry and people we are more likely to say that one man's meat is another man's poison. Yet, despite this greater option in judging people, a society still tends to develop standardized meanings for a vast number of human acts. Such leveling of opinion may indeed be necessary for a culture to survive. Thus an individual's body movements get judged largely in terms of the meaning which most people assign to them. If the individual inclines to be an "average citizen," he will attribute to his own overt acts the same messages and meanings that others are likely to give them, taking what George H. Mead called "the role of the other." In the course of his enculturation, for example, other people will call him happy if he constantly smiles and laughs. And probably he will soon internalize this meaning for him- self, without at first feeling anything more than the way he usually feels when he smiles and laughs - whatever this feel- ing may actually be! Likewise, as a typical child he has learned that some of his acts are called good and others bad. If his elders and peers are to approve of him, he must imitate this particular distribution of meanings. His early self-apprais- als therefore tend to copy the appraisals made by his family, teachers, and playmates. He usually lives out his life without recognizing the social and arbitrary character of these evalu- ations. He does not even regard them as evaluations, but as- sumes instead that they are true descriptions of his deeds and personality; and he will normally impose the same assumption on his own children. But the fact is that these specious descriptions represent a kind of judgment entirely different from that by which we commonly identify physical objects and events. When we say "John gave his coat to his friend," we are stating a fact of common sense (and of science as well). The language we 424</page><page sequence="7">DECEMBER 1967 LANGUAGE OF MORAL RESPONSIBILITY choose to express this fact has of course been ratified by soci- ety, but it still follows the fact and is in part determined by it. When, however, we say "John was generous in giving his coat to his friend," our statement does not follow the fact of John's "generosity." The only established fact is that he gave his coat to his friend ; and this fact does not imply any fact of generosity, as the frequent difference of opinion about such claims should be enough to show. Yet within any integrated culture there is often a near unanimity behind assertions about the "inner nature" of the acts and personalities of others. Because these assertions are stamped into us at such an early age, it is hard to tell them apart from the more objective and descriptive learnings we have acquired right along with them. Thus people will say "John is generous" in the same way they will say "John is six feet tall," unaware that the similarity of grammar hides a gap - that the first judgment springs from a meaning they have read into John's behavior, as a reader of Arabic would read a meaning into some Arabic script, while the second arises from an observation of a measurable physical dimension. As already hinted, the distinction is additionally blurred be- cause other members of the same culture are, despite their proven capacity to dissent, so often just as ready to agree on* John's generosity as they are on his height, thereby making the first judgment seem as objective and verifiable as the second. What Harry Stack Sullivan called "consensual valida- tion" may be equally present in both decisions. But John's height is still visibly and publicly out there in a sense in which his generosity can never be. We see that he is so tall, but we must read him to be generous. And it is what people mean, not what they are , which is of most import to us. III. Freedom and Compulsion Now freedom to EXAMINE and autonomy. the idea we Let began us again with retreat - that of to human a Car- freedom and autonomy. Let us again retreat to a Car- tesian starting point. Most of us from sometime in childhood have had a type of experience which we call by various names but which, by its very occurrence, makes us feel that our 425</page><page sequence="8">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XXIV, NO. 4 actions at that moment are the products of our own decisions - which decisions, in turn, are not compelled by any events external to us or by any irresistible physiological drives within our bodies. At such times we say that we have alternatives for our future behavior; from this point we go through a process of deciding which course we should take. While this curious decision-making process may introduce and lead us to con- sider other impelling influences - ethnical values, rational in- sight, factual information, physical desires, etc. - we retain the belief that our own wills are still in control of the situ- ation. This experience, which philosophers have often called "specious free-will," remains what it is in its prima facie qualities and relations. It is above all an introspective experi- ence; it cannot be duplicated by looking at the behavior of another person in a similar situation or by watching our re- flection in a mirror while the decision and its execution are taking place. If we interpret the experience physiologically, we must say that it relies on proprioceptive rather than on exterioceptive stimuli. In mentalistic language this means that the experience is an entirely private one. In many cultures this sense of freedom has been cherished as a philosophic and political ideal. Yet it is an experience no person can save as his own; all else we can do is to infer that some other person has the same kind of experience, when he does what we do when we have it. We ascribe our own class of "free" experiences to other people's "inner lives" at these times, and we decide that they too are acting "freely," thus laying the basis from which many judicial systems come to identify responsibility and guilt. Furthermore, because we unknowingly learn to react to other people as symbols rather than as things, we find it easy to read this meaning of freedom into those of their behaviors which are suited to it. Now reason we shall that this look personal at another experience side of of the freedom picture. is One so reason that this personal experience of freedom is so prized is because it is not as common or ubiquitous as we would like to have it. We are not gods. For much of our 426</page><page sequence="9">DECEMBER 1967 LANGUAGE OF MORAL RESPONSIBILITY careers we suffer an opposite kind of experience which we call being compelled, forced, or coerced. This experience also emerges early in our lives, probably because of the continual use of physical strength to move, bathe, dress, and feed us. The force so used is, of course, external, but the feeling of being forced by the force, of having to give in to it, remains an introspective experience which, like the feeling of freedom, is also not duplicarle by watching another person or by seeing ourselves in a mirror. The child soon learns that words like "make," "must," "force," and "compel" are socially used to classify these in- voluntary and often uncomfortable experiences. After a time he begins to extend these meanings to the premonitory signs of force - to the verbal or gestural requests, commands, or pleadings which the parent soon tries to substitute for direct physical action. Those vicars usually do their work by pro- voking within the child some anticipation or fear - either that the threatened force will indeed be exerted or that some re- prisal will come in its stead. These internally located happen- ings then begin, in advance, to create within the child the same results as the original external force. As the child gets socialized, the metaphorical growth of terms like "compel," "make," "force," "must," and "have to" spreads to a vast range of situations, only a few of which are ever actually strengthened by fulfilling the original warning. As adults we say "I must buy a new car," "He has to catch the plane," "I am forced to dismiss you," or "Our country is compelled to rearm" - a way of talking that once prompted Ortega y Gasset to refer to "the fabricated necessi- ties of modern life." Although no actual force is or even would be used upon us, we still have a personal experience as though it were being used. Continuation and repetition of the experience goes on, not because any force and compulsion are there, but because the experience has been thoroughly im- pregnated with the meaning of words like compel, make, and force. Here, once more, the symbols which do duty for the extensional "reality" not only do their job, but do it much better than the reality would do it for itself. 427</page><page sequence="10">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XXIV, NO. 4 WE Such are movements now moving may be into necessary, some strange however, meditations. if we are Such movements may be necessary, however, if we are ever to advance beyond the old snare of clichés and unexam- ined speech in which discussion of this subject has been im- prisoned for centuries. First, some summary and clarification are in order. Early introspective experiences, in which we either get our own way or get someone else's way thrust upon us, accrue certain classifying labels like "freedom" and "compulsion." Other people first apply these terms to us, and then, because we are imitative creatures and want to be liked, we come to take them as our own. What other people perceive, however, are not our introspective experiences but our publicly dis- played behavior which accompanies them. To illustrate, our successful grabbing of a bottle for which we reach will be called free behavior, while our being hauled to the bedroom despite our cries will be called compelled behavior. Trouble enters at this point, however, because there is never any assurance of a one-to-one correlation between our introspective experiences and our overt behaviors which go with them. We may well be grabbing the bottle because we are desperately hungry and not because we have leisurely decided to play with it. Yet the public may still judge this act to be "free." On the other hand, feigning our cries, we may have deliberately maneuvered our parent to haul us to bed (out of some need for attention or wish to be carried) and have enjoyed every second of it. Yet here the outsider is likely to regard the act as one of compulsion, when to us it is more like one we would call free. Such considerations begin to reveal the complexity of our interpersonal relations. Sooner or later most of us are prone to accept for our- selves these social labels, not only for our patent behaviors, but for the private, inner experiences which underlie them. Most of us come to take the public's word for what is inside us. Lifelong symbolic confusions may thus lie in store for us. Experimental psychologists, for the sake of their own episte- mology, are then quite correct in refusing to accept among their findings such alleged mental states as anger, fear, and 428</page><page sequence="11">DECEMBER 1967 LANGUAGE OF MORAL RESPONSIBILITY contentment and in admitting only reports of frowning, trembling, and low blood-pressure. Who can tell for sure what is really going on in another's introspective field? One can seriously wonder, in a mixed culture like our own, how many people sincerely say they are happy when their actual inner sentiments are nearly identical with those of other people when they say they are miserable. Psychiatrists are not the only ones who know of those occasional cases in which jolly and animated behavior is suddenly followed by a totally unexpected suicide. But how many more cases may there be in which similar people live up to the label imposed on their personality and continue to lead what both they and the public aver is a "long, happy life"? Here there is also an interesting question as to the degree to which inner experience itself may become changed to fit the symbol used to identify it. When this process of symbolic assimilation is sufficiently pervasive, we might suspect that the individual's later conduct becomes guided, not by the intrinsic nature of the introspective experiences themselves, but by the logical role of the names he has come to give them. To the extent that this is so, what he does in life as a man, say, who is sometimes said to be free and at other times compelled could be best understood, if not predicted, by a study of his syntax. As seemingly far fetched as these speculations may be, they suggest a new road of inquiry to answer the hitherto unanswered (and fruitless) question: What does it mean to say that a person is acting freely or that he is acting under compulsion? IN "autonomy" any event, on the the one polar hand, meanings and of of "compulsion" "freedom" and and "autonomy" on the one hand, and of "compulsion" and "force" on the other, have long since become ambiguous, complicated, and split on the ancient philosophic dichotomy between introspective and extrospective data, between our private awareness of our inner "reality" and our shared aware- ness of both our own and other people's overt behavior. The original experiences (of want and satisfaction, and of want 429</page><page sequence="12">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XXIV, NO. 4 and privation) lie in the subjective field of the individual. No one else has these experiences. But the experiences are attended by behavior observable by both the individual and others, by publicly certified biological movements, like speech sounds, gestures, running, walking, and crying. Other (almost always older) people tag certain words to this behavior; and the individual so tagged comes to accept these tags in his own speech, to name not only the way he moves in public scenes but what he feels inside himself as his movements take place. Then he too, like his teachers, tags the similar acts of his neighbors with the same labels; and he further infers that behind their (publicly observable) behavior, there lies the same kind of inner life that lies behind his own. Thus these tags (speech sounds and script marks) get to be fundamental in our daily hearing, speaking, reading, and writing, at some cost to their former propriety to our own subjective experiences. These labels and descriptions become more and more generic as they name and describe typical hu- man states. To accept them as describing states of people is, however, as the present contention goes, to make a grievous mistake. Here, again, the behaviorists are right in rejecting such nomenclature for themselves, since, as behaviorists, they are bound to treat persons as objects - and never have freedom or compulsion been noticed as states of objects anywhere. David Hume astutely reasoned that our very idea of force or power never came from perceiving any object or event, but came from a constant sequence of one kind of event, like the blowing of the wind, with another kind, like the bending of a tree. Likewise, no such thing as freedom has ever been ob- served as a quality of another person. All that we ever have seen, when we say that certain people are "free," is that they make a move in some direction and reach the ultimate object, the "move" often consisting of some verbal announcement. So far as either compulsion or freedom have observable reality they have it within our immediately felt experience. It therefore seems that, in regard to such questions as compulsion and freedom, we must consciously and deliber- ately look at persons as we look at symbols if we are to make 430</page><page sequence="13">DECEMBER 1967 LANGUAGE OF MORAL RESPONSIBILITY any sense of what we perceive. Often, when we see someone performing in a certain situation we make statements like "He is compelled," or "She is free." We see an action, we de- scribe and affirm it. But we do not see compulsion or freedom. When, then, we see an action which we say is free or com- pelled, our report of this action is not so much a description as it is a translation. So, when we judge some external behavior of Jane to mean that she is free, we are doing the same kind of thing we do when we tell a person ignorant of German that "Sie ist frei" means "She is free." Just as we make sense of the Ger- man sound by putting it into a grammatical context of our own, so we make sense of Jane's "deliberate" act, expression of "purpose," look of "satisfaction," etc. We are interested in what these acts mean rather than in what they are. But our language deceives us about this interest, and it leads us to think we are perceiving some reality about the act. This error is similar to an error of our translator if he should simply say "Sie ist frei" is harsh, or rasping, and not give the mean- ing of the sentence at all. The The problem meaning of of "Sie public ist agreement frei" can be is also settled at quickly stake here. for The meaning of "Sie ist frei" can be settled quickly for most people by checking a German-English dictionary, al- though in lieu of such a dictionary there might be considerable argument among people largely ignorant of German. But there is no dictionary for the nonverbal behavior of Jane, so that not only the public, but even psychiatrists may well con- tinue to disagree about its meaning, as to whether it is free or compelled. This offers the startling suggestion that this is a kind of question that can never be solved as a question of fact. The ultimate reality in such a dispute is an event inside Jane's head, the experience of which is available only to Jane herself. But even more shocking is the fact that Jane herself, though experiencing whatever reality goes on inside her head, and though utterly honest in her intention to report it to others, has no way of knowing that what she is experiencing 431</page><page sequence="14">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XXIV, NO. 4 so intimately is the same kind of phenomenon you or I ex- perience when we say that we are free. Jane has long come to describe her introspective data from the way society has trained her to describe its public manifestations of which she, as a member of the public, is also aware. In accepting the public's verbiage about her smiles and gestures, she believes, perhaps in credulity, that this verbiage also describes her inner senti- ments. She actually has no way of knowing how the other people around her would or should describe what is happen- ing within her. Ironically that life most secret to us is the least identifiable of all, contrary to Descartes. Thus rival judgments about a personality, such that he is "free" or "compelled," cannot be wholly negotiated on a conventional scientific or objective basis. That is why, for every psychiatrist supporting the prosecution in so many mod- ern trials, there is always another one to testify for the de- fense. Such disputes, despite the pretense, are not really about the "reality" inside the person, but about what the public (or the jury) should take the defendant's behavior to mean. Such differences of judgment, if they can ever be resolved at all, must therefore be ironed out in the way that our race has long since come to consummate contracts, treaties, and con- stitutions. The issue, in deepest fact, is never whether a given person is free or compelled in what he does, but whether we judges can agree that his acts mean "freedom" or "compulsion." The agreement, once achieved, and if sincerely accepted by most of the judges, may then indeed - although completely irrelevant to any scientific fact - still have radical consequences both for the future of the individual, as in the case of capital punish- ment, and for the moral standards of the society which judges him. This possibility we shall discuss more. So "freedom" and "compulsion" would seem to be terms which have their original referents in the realm of childlike introspection, but which then stretch their application to the publicly observed behavior of ourselves and others and be- come a basis for our judgments of the inner life of others. The next problem is to examine the notion of "causal de- 432</page><page sequence="15">DECEMBER 1967 LANGUAGE OF MORAL RESPONSIBILITY terminism" which has been most frequently opposed to the concept of "freedom" and "free will." IV. Indeterminism and Determinism It determinism is at least an arose intelligent from the guess primitive, that the introspective notion of causal feel- determinism arose from the primitive, introspective feel- ing of being compelled. But, like many offspring, it came to renounce its parentage. Psychologically it was still only a short step between earlier anthropomorphic beliefs that gods or spirits command our environment and the Galilean belief in physical causation. But, with greater sophistication born of the technical bias of our epoch, and through analyses of such men as Hume, our idea of cause and effect became fixed on the relatively invariant sequences among events of different classes - sequences to which, like other organisms, we have been involuntarily conditioned to respond, and which, as articulate humans, we finally came to verbalize as "laws." This is where the causal concept now belongs in the dis- course of science and in much of everyday speech; here it acquires and occupies its present literal status in referring to certain regularities in our experience - regularities which we regard as immune to any capricious response we might show to them. Physical causation, when ascertained amid a series of events, is strictly part of the event-situation, something we simply describe. Thus, while a primitive people may read into a storm cloud a sign of a god's wrath or of some imminent disaster, the cloud's behavior as a possible precursor or cause of rain remains unchanged. In this way, "causal determinism" gets wired in our cultivated object-language; and, regardless of its embryonic career, it no longer retains its former re- lationship to the introspective experience of compulsion. A pertinent note here is that the great behavioral deter- minisms of the past century (of Darwin, Marx, Pavlov, and Freud especially) have induced many of us to ignore or ex- plain away our conscious feeling of being free. They have relied upon alleged proofs of objective causation - a causation claimed to be beyond the threshold of introspective aware- ness, either undetected or denied by common sense. 433</page><page sequence="16">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XXIV, NO. 4 This clever way of getting behind the introspective scene has giren these popular determinisms both their controversy and their power. These determinisms have since been accepted by myriad people who are still in no way immediately con- scious of being compelled or forced in their own ''free" de- cisions ; they may well continue to acknowledge that they feel free, but if their belief in one of these determinisms is firm, they will insist post hoc that their feeling was illusory. The greatest danger here is the possible confusion of de- termination with compulsion. Sometimes determinists are so carried away by their intellectual conviction that they are even ready to claim that though they feel perfectly free, deep down they know they actually must be compelled. But what is being compelled as distinct from feeling compelled? If one does not feel compelled, how can he meaningfully say that he is com- pelled? The only reply could be to cite some statistics, by re- ferring to some recurrent context of the experience, or by alluding to some system of knowledge quite independent of the experience. Yet this is the stuff the deterministic dreams are made of - and it is irrelevant to compulsion. "Determin- ism" and "compulsion" are not synonyms but are logically quite extraneous. What mation kind that OF some statement, human behavior then, would has been deny causally an affir- de- mation that some human behavior has been causally de- termined? Would it be an affirmation that the behavior was free? Not at all, for "freedom" refers to an introspective experience which is contrastable only with that other kind of introspective experience we call compulsion. And compulsion, as we have just shown, is quite independent of determination. "Causal determinism" (or "determination") names certain manifestations of order, lawfulness, and regularity among se- quences of events - sequences from whose consistency we hope to correctly predict the future. Its contradictory ex- pression is therefore not freedom, but indetermini sm - that is, disorder, unlawfulness, irregularity, etc. In its more precise scientific usages, "indeterminacy" abbreviates certain statistical descriptions of flows of data within a chosen series - flows 434</page><page sequence="17">DECEMBER 1967 LANGUAGE OF MORAL RESPONSIBILITY from whose observation and correlation it is impossible to make consistently correct predictions.2 It thus has nothing to do with introspection or with the projection of our intro- spective experiences into other people, nor does it have any logical implication with respect to "freedom" or "free will." Indeterminism and determinism are thus descriptive terms which normally play their roles in our object-language about series of ordinary objects, events, qualities, and relations (in- cluding objects like language and people so far as we regard them non-symbolically) . But freedom and compulsion are on an entirely distinct level of language; they belong to meta- language or language about language (and other symbols). As such they are interpretive terms, like those used in trans- lations, decipherings, and decodings. What these terms in- terpret, however, are the symbolic events we call "uniquely human acts," "personalities," etc., which include not only our spoken sentences, but our facial expressions, gestures, pos- tures, mannerisms, intonations, body tone, etc. The two contrasting pairs of terms differ in one respect as do the statements "She is blonde" and "She is shrewd" ; or better yet, as do the statements "He will fail his creditors" and "He is dishonest." Statements of the former class de- scribe or assert what was, is, or will be the case; the latter statements reveal what the other person and his acts mean to the speaker, and they may even imply how the speaker and society are going to act because the person's action-messages have been read in this particular way. In the last analysis, of course, statements of both kinds must be considered by an ideal behavioral science: the first because they tell what is so regardless of the psychological and linguistic reactions of the speaker; the second because they announce the symbolic social role to which the person has been assigned and therefore may tacitly predict how indi- viduals (as well as the general public) will behave as a result. 2 Of course there is an important distinction between those series which exemplify total randomness (or entropy) and those which are subject to statistical (or stochastic) measurements and yield useful probability judgments about the distributions of future data. But in both cases indeterminacy reigns over each specific event in the series. 435</page><page sequence="18">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XXIV, NO. 4 (If most of us agree that John is "dominating," our very agreement may affect his and our behavior in such a way as to make him in fact dominating, if he was not already so. This is part of what Robert Merton called "the self-fulfilling prophecy.") Thus an oxymoron to say that but someone it is not is "free, a contradiction. yet determined," Even may so, we be an oxymoron but it is not a contradiction. Even so, we know that so many attempts to prove the "existence of free- will" regard freedom and determinism as mutually exclusive concepts; and they build their case for voluntary and auton- omous behavior by finding some possible breakdown within known causal systems of physics, biology, psychology, etc. So we have had the "doctrine of emergence," by which living matter supposedly acts with a kind of inborn spontaneity amid the causation bound context of the dead; the alleged loopholes in the physical universe, dating from the "swerve" of the Lucretian atoms to its modern rescuer; "the principle of uncertainty," by which a specific cosmic unpredictability has been transferred (even by such a scientist as Arthur H. Compton) into the human nervous system; and a continuing stirring of old religious hopes based on the incapacity of the behavioral sciences to predict more than a tiny few of human responses. In the present argument, such persuasions, however con- vincing, are beside the point. All they can establish is what we already know - that is, the presence of indeterminacy, irregularity, accident, and eccentricity in human conduct. And none of these has anything to do with freedom. In the early nineteenth century the French mathematician Pierre Laplace, in asserting the most extreme form of mechanistic deter- minism, concluded that only human ignorance of facts and laws prevented us from exactly foretelling the total cosmic future, including every human sneeze or cough and the fall of every sparrow. Even if this vision were justified, it would not qualify as a valid denial of free-will, for such an absolute and omnific determinism would, in order to fulfill its own goals, have to recognize and correlate the many projections 436</page><page sequence="19">DECEMBER 1967 LANGUAGE OF MORAL RESPONSIBILITY and introjections of "freedom" into our behavior, and give the arbitrary meanings we have assigned to the term "freedom" a status as an effective variable in the causal scheme of things. It is an old saying that no matter what philosophers and scientists may say, most people will go on acting as though they were free and responsible creatures and will continue to praise and blame, reward and punish one another. Perhaps this is so because the language by which all this normal human activity is organized and justified simply cannot be touched by a language which views humans as law-bound objects and events amid the other objects and events of the universe. To say that some pieces on a chess board are made of wood or of ivory can never have the slightest effect on the way the trained players are going to move them. V. Freedom as a Meaning The ing crux between of the those position statements taken about so far a lies person in distinguish- which de- ing between those statements about a person which de- scribe and assert his "independent" traits, motions, relation- ships, etc., and those statements which are announcements of what this person means to other persons (and/or to himself) as a constellation of symbols. One quick way to learn whether a statement about a person is about what that person means as a set of symbols is to ask a traditional behaviorist if he rejects it. By doing this we can readily suspect that anger, hope, love, joy, honesty, malice, freedom, etc. are meanings ascribed to a person rather than qualities in a person. The acts which the layman calls angry, hopeful, etc., are real and objective enough; and they are what our psychologist observes and correlates, while labeling them with his own professional names. But wider and richer behaviorisms must reckon with the obvious fact that a clenched fist or a smile may precede (and augur) quite different public acts (possibly by both observer and behavior) if they are given (respectively) the meanings of anger and friendliness or if they are given the meanings of desperation and smugness, much as an ambiguously hewn 437</page><page sequence="20">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XXIV, NO. 4 chess piece will precede and augur quite different hand mo- tions if it is called a queen instead of being called a bishop. Roughly, "meaning" can be here defined as "the logical role which a symbol plays in some given symbol system," just as the meaning of the bishop is found by learning the rules for moving it, not by what it looks like. When this role changes (and a new meaning is thus given) the responses of people to the symbol also change. So even those who want a consum- mate determinism for their intellectual security cannot ignore these projected and introjected meanings. Plainly, they are needed to predict. They may or may not cohere with con- ventional scientific laws in their beginnings; but, once they do begin, they surely must become a part of any law that fol- lows - if any law does follow. At least it should be clear that people live in their own autonomous world, and that, to the extent that their activity is free of the laws of the universe, it must be studied and understood in its own right as a special phenomenon, diag- nosed through its own peculiarities as a symptom of cultural and symbolic behavior. This is a point made by Leslie White in his interesting book The Science of Culture, which, while wrongly deterministic in its version of human decision making, is one of the most important statements of our time about the nature of human behavior. Use of the symbolic matrix, therefore, seems to be indis- pensable if we are to make any sense of what we creatures do and, specifically, if we are to find more than slogans in all our talk about human freedom and autonomy. Although we usually do not see it as so, our common reply to an im- portant human act is not to its most determinate (scientifi- cally proven) features - its agent, motion, recipient, etc. - ■ but to what the act symbolizes inside the person and inside of us. Whether we know it or not, we treat such an act as a message. The trouble is that we usually do not know it. Our empirical language has so objectified all human behavior (being, by its very nature, language which is about some- thing) that we think we are recognizing a pure act, like a star passing a cross-hair, which is what it is, when in fact 438</page><page sequence="21">DECEMBER 1967 LANGUAGE OF MORAL RESPONSIBILITY we are recognizing a symbol which means just what it means to us. As a result, when we propel our symbolic meaning into such an act, we tend to think we are inferring some entity, property, or state in the person who performed the act. If we judge the act to be happy, we conclude that it is caused by happiness; if we decide that it was free, we say it is a consequence of freedom. We also do this in appraising our own acts, because society has trained us to use the prevailing idiom to explain ourselves. The names we give to our precious, inner states turn out to be the masters of what they name. And the names belong, not to the world of Mendel or Pavlov or Freud, but to what Ludwig Wittgenstein casually called "the language game." We be now called return free or to compelled. our decision Such that a a judgment given act excites is to be called free or compelled. Such a judgment excites our traditional mentalistic and physiological outlooks as an ontological verdict about a person's objective state. If we see the act as free we follow a moral commitment to bestow on it some measure of acclaim or censure; but if we see it as compelled we assume a moral neutrality, forego any evaluation, and simply, as a scientist, try to explain it. That we take so seriously our imputations of a meaning as true and absolute descriptions of personality and character makes it that much harder to realize that we have any responsibility for such judgments. Of course our acceptance of such a meaning may be only our objective recognition that the rest of society, quite apart from our will, has assigned or probably will, in fact, assign this meaning to the act. But this is a different kind of statement altogether; and usually we make such an assessment as our own, not admitting society's part in influencing us. The point is just that when we take the social verdict, however unconsciously, as our own, we are responsible for what we have done. Whenever we say that "x" means "y," we are generally saying we have decided that, for ourselves, "x" shall mean "y," regardless of the social consensus. We don't have to play the given game and agree to let the five 439</page><page sequence="22">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XXIV, NO. 4 of hearts trump the ace of spades unless we want to. When we make such agreements we are being as arbitrary as our society is when it pronounces the value of its currency. People suffer emotional want from such suggestions be- cause they are so accustomed to thinking of freedom as a thing that they cannot even imagine it as a meaning without depre- cating its reality. In great part this is the fault of our Western subject-predicate language, which states the freedom and the weight of a person in similar grammatical form. But pro- founder insights may teach us better: That freedom is a mean- ing (that is, a logical role that certain acts play in our inter- personal symbol system) in no way need shrink its importance or deny its reality. Look at the importance of a passport or a stock certificate in our time and place! To think of freedom as a meaning instead of as a thing simply changes its nature in our experience and may yield us far more information about it. To say that what we always took as a pure thing is instead a symbol is simply to say that, in being a thing, it functions also as a symbol. Yet to know how many things function, to know what they do to other things and other parts of our experience, may be far more important than knowing what they are. To contend otherwise is like thinking that we must attribute less importance or reality to a coin when we call it a dime than when we call it a metal disc, or to a playing card by calling it a ten of hearts than by calling it a rectangle of stiff paper with ten red heart-shaped designs. Such mobile and manipulable symbol-units, in various games, in a national economy, and in countless verbal and nonverbal interactions, thus come to direct future behavior solely because of the meanings and roles we assign to them. In more tragic matters, for example, the results of what today is termed a felony depend not so much on the act itself and the injury inflicted by it, but on whether the act acquires the meaning of freedom or of compulsion to the judge or jury, on whether the actor is judged sane or insane. In such cases the tribunal is not judging the defendant or "figuring out" what is the case with him; rather, it is making itself subject 440</page><page sequence="23">DECEMBER 1967 LANGUAGE OF MORAL RESPONSIBILITY to judgment by its own fiat, its own announcement that "x is to mean y and not z." But no aspiring determinist can be allowed to forget such fulcrums of human behavior and the symbolism invested in them. When pulsion" we project into a human a meaning act we like are "freedom" not at that or moment "com- pulsion" into a human act we are not at that moment describing the act at all, nor are we giving the slightest hint as to what caused it or even whether it ever had a cause. This means that our placements of human responsibility and our moral ratings of individual acts are not ipso facto affected by our objective or scientific knowledge of their nature or cause. This is why fervent adherents of certain determinisms can still so readily damn or beatify given individuals whom, in the long run of biology or history, they must regard as help- less expressions of immutable laws. It is quite a mistake to accuse such converts to determinism or inconsistency. They have every linguistic right to inveigh against their enemies, for example, not merely as one might deplore a law-bound rattlesnake, but as a Christian would saddle "evil" on Judas or Pilate. Commitment to a determinism does not vitiate one's privilege to use moral aspersions or encomiums. The liberty to give one's own meaning to the facts of life remains un- impaired no matter how inevitable the facts may be deemed to be. The acts to which we impute these judgmental meanings may well have their causes, but these causes are irrelevant to the meanings we give. Likewise, our act of assigning the meaning (of "freedom" or "compulsion") may well have its causes too, but this situation is most surely not like the one in which the fact that x is blue and round causes our statement that x is blue and round. To the contrary, the differential causes of our statement that x is a free act are to be found, not in any intrinsic freedom of the act, but within the logical and psychological symbol-system in which the name given to the act comes to fit. Even the decision that a certain piece of paper is a one-pound note is only sparked and made possible by the printed words one pound on its surface. We must 441</page><page sequence="24">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XXIV, NO. 4 still decide that it will function as an authentic one-pound note and that this piece of paper has a definite logical role cut out for it in the British monetary system; for example, it is exchangeable for twenty shillings or perhaps for a new hat. With human acts which do not bear signs announcing their meaning, our assignment of a logical role is even more dis- cretionary. In fact, our very decision is casting part of its role ; we are in effect saying, "I* have decided that in my future experience this act shall henceforth function as a free (or com- pelled) act. Accordingly, I shall (or shall not) reward or punish its actor because of this decision." This last point suggests that our assignments, like "free- dom" and "compulsion" to human acts, are much more im- mune from external facts than we have been trained to admit. This is not to say that such assignments are any less influential on human behavior or that they are any less necessary to a well-ordered society. But we must at least concede that the lines we draw, say, between freedom and compulsion do not have to be drawn where we draw them; between different cultures and within our own culture they are, in fact, often drawn at widely different places. In addition,, we must here recognize again an interesting kind of self-fulfilling prophecy, in that the individual who feels he is free or compelled will often tend to feel this way to the degree that his respected authorities, adults, peers, etc., will attribute this feeling to him. Therefore, the projection of "freedom" or "compulsion" into someone else's given act may become amazingly literal - the same person may then actually begin to have a feeling similar to that which has been said to be in him by his fellows. Such a phenomenon makes more understandable why a unique and rigid moral training of a whole society is possible - just as possible, indeed, as the imposition of a common language or dialect. A person tends to take as his own self- image the prevailing image that others have of him. The moral status of his behavior is thus related, not to some amount or kind of morality within him, but to the consensual meaning of a whole complex of social reactions which have 442</page><page sequence="25">DECEMBER 1967 LANGUAGE OF MORAL RESPONSIBILITY compromised to declare some border between freedom and compulsion - a boundary which the person has then internal- ized into the prestige-laden verbalizations about himself. While all of this, logically speaking, is completely arbitrary, it is still the basis of what we call morality. And it is important! VI. The Message of Innocence The thus sort varies of from behavior person which to person is called and free from or responsible culture to thus varies from person to person and from culture to culture. The Western Protestant tradition, however, has made it a supreme tell-tale of personal character and conduct. Yet the carriers of this tradition have used their ability to assign the particular meaning, freedom, with severe and concealed partiality. Perhaps under the spell of the spirit-flesh dichot- omy, they have narrowly selected as our symbols of freedom those acts which we classify as conscious, intentional, and de- liberate behavior. In so doing, they have left large ranges of our nonconscious and nonverbal behavior outside the domain of human responsibility. At this point the illogical mixing of determinism with compulsion has again given some strange results. This "out- side" area has been left open for invasion by the several "sci- entific" determinisms with their respective "lawful" explana- tions. Having made a good deal of sense about certain hitherto unexplainable areas of human behavior, like the intransigence of the bourgeoisie, the slips of the tongue, or the reactions to a loud noise, these determinisms have overflowed into the rest of our behavior, including that we call free. This has created a paradox for many people who "feel free" yet, because they believe in Newton, Freud, or Thomas Hardy, are intellectually convinced that they are determined and may even carry the conviction so far that they actually feel their every decision to be compelled. Thus, sooner or later, such persons are prone to replace their feeling of freedom with one of compulsion, thereby, in the words of Jean Paul Sartre, "abdicating their humanity." Here, indeed, modern existentialism has a significant insight. Merely to re- 443</page><page sequence="26">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XXIV, NO. 4 port a human event is to be like a camera or a sheet of carbon paper - to be non-human; but to interpret a human act as right or wrong, good or evil, free or compelled, is to take moral responsibility upon one's own shoulders. A drama like Sartre's Dirty Hands is a stirring challenge to those citizens who seek impunity by imagining themselves to be mere moral describers instead of responsible assigners of moral meanings. In this play the protagonist goes far out of his way to induce society to regard his unpremeditated "crime of passion" as the planned, intended act of an ideo- logical assassin who finally had to give his life to prove that he had really meant to do what he did. Once we realize that freedom and compulsion are declared meanings rather than hard and fast things, we can take full responsibility both for much of our own conduct and for our ethical decisions about others. Beyond this, we must acknowledge our intellectual right and ability to assign and distribute the meaning of freedom differently from the way we do. Surprisingly enough, a prod- uct of one of the new determinisms, the freudian theory of ''unconscious purpose," suggests a most important possibility. In therapy, use of this theory has brought some people to feel responsible not just for what they mean to do, but also for what they do do. Our society could easily revise its posi- tion to reassign freedom and responsibility to a far wider range of unintended behavior. While, in using such a re- formed language, we can stop at any point we please, we could still go so far that we would no more countenance many injurious social "accidents" than we now condone deliberate assault or vandalism. It would be an interesting experimental problem whether or not such a shift in our moral language would actually decrease both the frequency and the harm of such "accidents." The much scientific of mankind humanist behaves. tends to He be has a sharp more critic right of than the way he much of mankind behaves. He has more right than he knows. But he must face the fact that the conventional nature of science makes it hard to be human, and the tradition of 444</page><page sequence="27">DECEMBER 1967 LANGUAGE OF MORAL RESPONSIBILITY humanism has made it hard to be scientific. However, the in- compatibility is a needless one created by the ways in which we have learned to talk. Metaphors like "implanting," "im- printing," "registering," and "stamping" truth in people's minds have too long dominated both psychology and edu- cation. In respect to human acts, we have adopted the same attitude and have bent ourselves merely to record and explain them. Scientific humanism, because of its profound and proud concern with secular values, is more obligated than most out- looks to adjust the normative and descriptive disciplines to one another. This adjustment, however, will never be made until we discern that "fact statements" come from a commit- ment to play the fact-game, while "value statements" arise from a pledge to follow one's own choice among commonly marketed moral games, or from the creation of and pledge to follow the rules of one's own game. How we translate the meaning of a human act becomes, in the deepest way, our personal problem; it is a social problem too, insofar as the individual has some sense of pride or guilt about the group of people to whom he belongs. Some of these intimations are hard-hearted. Certainly they run contrary to much popular sentiment in social work and mental hygiene movements. Still, we must be mindful that millions of individuals work hard to send about themselves a lifelong "message of innocence." This message is much easier to send when one only has to "mean well" and "think happy thoughts," while all the rest of his de facto hostile and destructive deeds can be said to be determined, or even "com- pelled." Perhaps we need to widen this message to include the net sum of one's conduct. Perhaps we need to cheer St. Peter on to write in his book the total behavioral message of each applicant. 445</page></plain_text>
