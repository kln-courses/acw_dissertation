Ceramically, Nalakihu was confusingly complex. Types ascribed to the Anasazi, Mogollon, and Patayan "roots" occurred in almost equal percentages. The remainder of the material culture was almost equally varied. King compares all the traits from Nalakihu with contempo- rary adjacent foci of the three roots in a unique table, not only listing all the traits for all the pertinent foci but also evaluating their importance as to whether they are present, rare, common or presumed. The results suggest either that trade was active and diverse or else, as King surmises, intermarriage between these groups was commonplace. It is unfortunate that more definite conclusions could not be offered, for Nalakihu exempli- fies the cosmopolitan situation so evident in the Flag- staff area following the eruption of Sunset Crater about 1066 A.D. However, the reader who is unfamiliar with the some- what involved taxonomic terminology used by those studying the archaeology of the Flagstaff area will find this text difficult to assimilate. A brief introductory statement clearly formulating the areal and cultural manifestations embodied in the terms Chino, Elden and Klethla would be helpful. Nevertheless, Nalakihu re- mains a sound contribution to the. prehistory of the Flagstaff area in particular and of the Southwest as a whole. FRED WENDORF Harvard University Cambridge, Mass. Surface Archaeology of Ixtlan del Rio, Nayarit. E. W. GIFFORD. University of California Publications in American Archaeology and Ethnology, Vol. 43, No. 2, 1950. Pp. viii + 183-302, 30 plates, 20 figures, 1 map. $2.25. In 1931 the University of California purchased a col- lection of Mexican pottery and stone objects from So- nora, Sinaloa, Jalisco, and Nayarit. Included in the collection were fifty of the pottery figurines character- istic of the prehistoric culture of the Ixtlan del Rio, Nayarit, region. In 1946 Mr. Gifford visited Ixtlan, in order to become acquainted with the source of this excellent collection and to acquire sherds which would show the pottery types associated with the figurines. This paper contains the results of that visit. No excavations were undertaken. Collections of arch- aeological specimens, pottery and stone, were obtained from the surface and exposed banks of sixteen sites in the vicinity of Ixtlan. An analysis of the potsherds thus obtained constitutes the bulk of the report, with a short section devoted to the stone artifacts recovered. This paper also contains a discussion and illustrations of the figurines in the University of California collection. Based in part on stratigraphy, and also on stylistic grounds, three pre-Spanish cultural horizons are distin- guished in the vicinity of Ixtlan. By a comparative study the culture of Ixtlan is linked with the Nayarit-Sinaloa coastal cultures of the north and with the Autlan- Tuxcacuesco cultures to the south, but also note is made of the fact that Ixtlan possesses much that is unique. Gifford's Early period is distinguished by the pottery figurines and fine polychrome pottery. This period is equated with the Early and Middle Chametla periods of Sinaloa. Early Chametla, in turn, has been postulated to be contemporaneous with the Late Teotihuacan period in Central Mexico. Thus, Gifford is of the opin- ion that the Ixtlan figurine complex may be contem- poraneous with Late Teotihuacan. The Middle period contains certain pottery wares belonging to the Aztatlan complex, and also annular- base molcajetes, or chili grinders, pottery plaques, nubbin and flanged ware, and three-quarter grooved stone axes. The presence of the Aztatlan complex at Ixtlan bears out its wide distribution as originally supposed by Sauer and Brand. It is now reported from Guasave, Sinaloa, on the north to the Ixtlan, Nayarit, region on the south, and possibly related wares are to be found along most of the Jalisco coast. The Late period is characterized by plain wares, bi- chrome wares, and tripod molcajetes. It is equated with Late, Middle, and (or) Early Chametla of Sinaloa and Late Autlan of Jalisco. The archaeology of western Mexico is still so poorly known that all real contributions are very significant. Certainly this paper is a real contribution and Gifford has utilized his surface material to fullest advantage. The report is well written, excellently illustrated, and its importance is increased by the fact that it gives us considerable additional information on an area little known archaeologically. It is only to be hoped, and here I echo the plea made by Gifford, that adequate and controlled excavations may be undertaken in the vicinity of Ixtlan, so that the relationships of the Ixtlan culture to the better known Mexican cultures may be established on a firmer foun- dation. ROBERT H. LISTER University of Colorado Boulder, Colorado La Ceramica de Monte Alban III A. IGNACIO BERNAL. Doctoral dissertation, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, 1949. Mimeographed, 162 pp., 206 figs., 2 tables, bibliography. What follows might be called a preview review, for it concerns the preliminary presentation of material which will form part of the definitive report on the pottery of Monte Alban, the enormous ancient site in Oaxaca that for many years has been under intensive excavation by Mexico's Instituto Nacional de Antro- pologia e Historia, under the leadership of Caso. 67</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUlITY' Monte Alban is of outstanding archaeological impor- tance. It is so situated in the heart of the area of high Mesoamerican civilizations as to have been able to re- ceive and disseminate influences from and to the Mix- teca-Puebla region, the Valley of Mexico, the Gulf Coast and the Maya country, both lowland and high- land. Perched on a lofty ridge commanding the junction of fertile valleys, it was for many centuries a great ceremonial center. During its long and apparently un- broken occupancy, building was piled on building, num- bers of elaborate tombs were constructed and richly furnished with mortuary offerings, many caches were laid down. There were thus produced stratigraphic con- ditions ideal for research on developments in architec- ture, sculpture, burial customs, and the minor arts. As result of the work by Caso and his associates the cultural history of the site has been divided into five major periods: Monte Alban I to V, the first reaching back into pre-Classic times, the last extending nearly to the Spanish Conquest. The present paper opens with discussion of the pot- tery of the transition between proto-Classic Monte Alban II and Monte Alban III A. Its major section has to do with the wares of the latter period, which saw the first local flowering of Classic culture. The material treated consists, for the most part, of complete vessels from tombs and caches, although the evidence of sherds from the stratigraphic tests has aided in the period assign- ments of tombs and caches. The vessels are well illus- trated, fully described, and precisely located as to pro- venience. The period of transition is believed by Bernal to have been a relatively short one. It saw the decline of pot- tery forms typical of Monte Alban II and the rise of the radically different forms characteristic of Monte Alban III A. The author does not believe the great changes that took place at this time in ceramic practise were due to a violent overturn, such as might have been brought about by conquest. He considers, how- ever, the possibility of a peaceful penetration of people of Zapotecan stock; and he feels sure that there was a shift from south to north in the source of influences on Monte Alban pottery-making. The older, southern influ- ence, that had been felt throughout Monte Alban I and II, he attributes to Mayoid cultures; the later, northern, to the potent central Mexican culture that centered at Teotihuacan. On the basis of origin, Bernal makes a three-fold classification of the pottery typical of Monte Alban III A. One group consists of forms inherited from Period II, but with significant alterations. Most notable of these is the anthropomorphic burial urn, whose ultimate origin he suspects to have been Olmec. A second and larger group he believes to consist of local innovations. Its type fossil, so to speak, is a bowl, approaching the hemis- pherical in shape and decorated with carving or incising. The third group is characterized by Teotihuacanoid ves- sels: cylindrical pieces with slab feet, tall-necked floreros, and variously shaped specimens of Thin Orange ware. The introduction of these was due to the above- mentioned northern influence. A number of the vessels were, indeed, actually imported from the north. As has been said, the descriptions and illustrations of the pottery are admirable and further information on the typical III A carved ware can be had from the author's earlier paper, "La Ceramica Grabada de Monte Alban," published in vol. III of the Anales del Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia. Here it suffices to say that, with the exception of a very few resist-deco- rated (negative) pieces, unpainted ware is overwhelm- ingly predominant. For the non-specialist, the meat of the report is con- tained in the concluding section. It is there noted that by the time of Monte Alban IIIA all signs of Olmec influence had disappeared. Attention is called to styl- istic resemblances between the carved decoration of IIIA bowls and that of Totonac stone sculpture. It is stated that no ceramic connections with the region north of the Valley of Mexico can be perceived. There follows a detailed comparison of III A pottery with that of Teotihuacan II and III and of the Esperanza phase of Kaminaljuyu in the highlands of Guatemala. His conclusions, Bernal makes clear, are based on pottery alone and studies of other aspects of culture might well alter the picture. But, from the ceramic evidence, he infers that during the period in question Monte Alban, Teotihuacan, and Kaminaljuyu enjoyed intimate association; that the cultures of all three formed parts of a single greater development, each one evolving a distinctive style of its own. He accordingly believes them to have been politically independent enti- ties that existed during a period sufficiently untroubled to allow free intercourse, both cultural and commercial. This, incidentally, coincides with the opinion held for some time by Miss Proskouriakoff and the reviewer that in early Classic times there was much more and much wider contact between the high Mesoamerican cultures than was the case in the later years of the Classic period. Passing to questions of relative chronology, Bernal suggests that Monte Alban II-III, the period of transi- tion, should be equated with the end of Teotihuacan II and the beginning of III. And, in the matter of absolute chronology, he would place Monte Alban III A between 200 and 600 A.D., the same centuries to which, on the basis of present knowledge, the Tzakol Phase of Uaxac- tun and the Esperanza Phase of Kaminaljuyu should also be assigned. As the report is confined to the wares of a single period in the long history of Monte Alban pottery, the reader must take on faith Bernal's statements as to their relationship with those of earlier and later phases. But his obviously intimate knowledge of them and the evident soundness of the field methods practised at the site give one full confidence in the validity of his con- clusions. His study of the specimens has been meticu- lous, but he has not allowed himself to become so im- mersed in detail as to have lost sight of the wider impli- 68 [1, 1951</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS cations of his material. One awaits with keen interest the appearance of the full report. It will be an out- standingly valuable contribution to the study of Meso- american prehistory. A. V. KIDDER 10 Frisbie Place Cambridge, Mass. Maya Hieroglyphic Writing: Introduction. J. ERIC S. THOMPSON.

Readers tending to balk at recognizing "civilizations" in pre-Columbia America may nevertheless be inclined to allow the term for the Maya of Meso-America. The Maya present a special case because their priests de- veloped a complicated calendrical mechanism for divi- nation and prophecy, with arithmetical and astronom- ical overtones and an elaborate system of carved or painted characters for dealing with such matters. The glyphs are only partly understood, and because of the nature of what has happened to survive they can best be studied together with the calendrical complex and the religious philosophy behind them. For a maximum yield of information one must utilize documents in various Mayan and European languages of the sixteenth century and later, and studies of modern Mayan ap- proaches to the supernatural, including surviving rem- nants of what has usually been thought of as the ancient calendrical machine. Hence this book is much more than its title might seem to imply, though the central theme is a search for meanings of hieroglyphs and the principles of their use. It is a masterpiece of synthesis in which the author's contributions are blended with those he finds acceptable in the work of others. He has consciously striven for good literary form as well as for sound science. The basic drive may be summed up by quoting a passage from page 2: "A comparison of one civilization with another in the Old World will, therefore, not yield reliable criteria for the formulation of any laws that may govern human progress. For evidence of independ- ent growth it is necessary to turn to the New World. . . . Naturally, the greater the progress, the greater the field for comparative study. One cannot weigh pot- sherds and flint points against the full range of Athenian civilization. One must seek the most advanced culture of the New World for that purpose. Maya temples and Maya sculpture can be compared with the products of Praxiteles, but that is not the whole story. Only a com- plete elucidation of Maya hieroglyphic texts and early colonial transcriptions will reveal the breadth of Maya life. The intellectual progress, the poetry, the philosophy of life, and, indeed, the whole spiritual achievement of the Maya, are contained therein, and these alone are worthy of comparison with the products of the minds of Pythagoras and Plato, Pindar and Aristotle. To chart the diverging and converging paths that lead independ- ently to the cultural peaks must be the final aim of history." With his eyes on the stars, the author has neverthe- less done his full share of exploration and excavation in the tropical forests which once were home to the classical Maya and are now all but deserted. Thus he understands the potentialities and limitations of dirt archaeology because he has practiced it, and he has dealt with its yield of material objects as a museum man. With all this he has been, and is, the Americanist who knows most about the Maya inscriptions on stone, about the religion, and about the documentary sources; the one who has thought about them most broadly. In the Introduction he provides historical perspective on progress in the field to date. Sound knowledge on a considerable scale really begins with the work of Ernst Forstemann in the 1880's. The list of important names since then is long, but on the level of analysis and resultant new and basically im- portant insight I think those of J. E. Teeple and of Thompson himself will stand out well above all others. He is the same person as the J. E. Thompson of his earliest publications. The present volume represents that part of Thompson's work through a quarter of a century which he himself regards as most significant. It has been anticipated as his magnum opus and justifies expectations. It renders obsolete the 1915 Introduction to the Study of the Maya Hieroglyphs of the late S. G. Morley but is not, as was Morley's, a textbook suitable for mildly in- terested readers. There is some dependence on cited earlier works of the author, and there is evidence of a rigorous "boiling down" process everywhere; yet the full coverage of so much material required some 300 large double-column pages of text. This text is written as if for straight-through reading, but the general flow of thought has had to be interrupted at many points in order to marshal evidence for new interpretations and inferences of the author. The scattered positions of some of this basically important and new material makes the apparatus for ready reference and handbook use especially important, and this was planned for. There is a considerable amount of cross-referencing, there is extensive use of subheadings rather fully re- flected in the Table of Contents, a bibliography of more than 550 titles, and a special Hieroglyphic Glossary and Index in addition to a general index. Unfortunately, in the final chapter where Thompson summarizes his own original contributions he does not systematically give page or figure references for one who wants to run things down, and sometimes the trail must be picked up by reading with only the Contents as a guide, when one of the indexes would have been expected to do the trick. The new contributions are numerous, varied, and ex- tremely important. I have no dbubt that most of them will stand the test of time, except, perhaps, a number of those concerning which the author himself specifically 69</page></plain_text>
