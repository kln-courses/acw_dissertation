<plain_text><page sequence="1">A "KEY" TO LAWRENCE DURRELL Alan Warren Friedman A Key to Lawrence Durrell lies in his book of criticism, A Key to Modern British Poetry." The bulk of the work treats the poetry of the 'nineties and of the 'thirties, individual poets such as Hopkins and Eliot, "movements" like the Georgians and the Imagists; but its core is a comparative analysis of Tennyson's Ulysses and Eliot's Gerontion-and the resulting theoretical speculations. Durrell sug- gests that, discounting individual temperament, the visions of the two poems differ because a cultural shift occurred between 1840 and 1920. Consequent to the imposition of scientific investigation upon the veneer of unquestioning religious faith, man the heroic master of his earthly fate yields to man the victim. Ulysses's movement is linear, unswervingly gathering its momentum until the apocalyptic affirmation of "To strive, to seek, to find and not to yield." In con- trast, Gerontion is cyclical and ends where it began, at an intellectual impasse, loss of faith, negation-at "the exhausted subjectivity of the contemporary hero" (Key, pp. 13-14). "I would like to suggest," Durrell adds, "that a good deal of the despair in Gerontion comes of a realization that the world has gone off the rails" (Key, p. 19)- that old notions of human possibility, personality, values, validity, and time have been irreversibly altered by Darwin, Einstein, and Freud in the modern world of their creating. The rock foundation of certainty reveals itself as a base of restive sand blown by the winds of pluralism, relativity, subjectivity, the Principle of Indeterminacy. 1 Lawrence Durrell, A Key to Modern British Poetry (Norman, Oklahoma, 1952).

WISCONSIN STUDIES VIII, 1</page><page sequence="2">Durrell's free-wheeling, probing analysis continually leads him outside the arts and into areas such as anthropology, psychology, science, and mysticism where, according to uncomfortable critics who cannot or refuse to follow, he has no business venturing. Yet to dismiss out of hand, to assume rather than prove that Durrell lacks the wherewithal for exploring in these areas, is circular and self- defeating-for it precludes, a priori, even the possibility that Durrell's approach is not haphazard or superficial. Durrell's understanding of himself and what he seeks to accom- plish is more incisive, more sensitive, than that of the precluders: "One dares not assert," he writes, "that poets and writers were con- sciously aware ... of the gradual modifications of our thoughts about the universe or ourselves. Poetry is the raw material of sensibility, and the poet's job is to go on making poetry, not to think too much about why or wherefore. But poets belong to an age. They have ancestors and pedigrees like their poems. And they register the gen- eral drift of things by their work." (Key, p. 64) The modern artist, then, whether painter, musician, or writer, does not consciously become a student and exponent of, say, Einstein or Freud; but none- theless his work necessarily and invariably reflects the revolution that has taken place in man's thinking about his universe and himself. All of man's concerns connect and fuse, impinging upon and borrow- ing from one another as a matter of course. And, as Durrell puts it, "literature is only one facet of the prism which we call culture. All the arts and sciences are simply different dialects of the same language, all contribute towards an attitude to life. What is this 'culture'? I take this word to mean the sum, at any given time, of all the efforts man is making to interpret the universe about him. Ideas from the various departments of thought cross fertilize each other, and it is sometimes a good idea to discuss one kind of thought in terms of another" (Key, pp. 1-2). Durrell rightly recognizes, then, the analo- gous nature of human activity, and that when the poet speaks of relativity and space-time continuum and the Principle of Indetermi- nacy it is irrelevant to ask whether he truly comprehends the technical significance of these terms. Durrell writes that "in order to obtain a coherent view of the bewildering world of science Einstein formulated a theory which everybody has heard about and very few people under- stand. As far as we are concerned only two aspects of it interest us: its attitude to time, and its attitude to the subject-object relationship" (Key, p. 28). And, it should be added, these interest us not in the way they interested Einstein, but only insofar as some artist, whether 32 J CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="3">consciously or not, has employed them in some aesthetically satisfying form. F. R. Leavis notes that "if the poetry and the intelligence of the age lose touch with each other, poetry will cease to matter much, and the age will be lacking in finer awareness"; and he goes on to cite Eliot's suggestion "that probably the modern's perception of rhythm has been affected by the internal combustion engine."2 One would be hard put to justify criticism that condemns an artist for being alive in and to his time; Leavis, in fact, would insist on the opposite, on the artist's being cognizant, in his work, of his temporal environment. In both The Alexandria Quartet and the Key to Modern British Poetry Durrell stresses the theoretical basis for his approach to struc- ture, personality, and aesthetics. Yet his fundamental concern-and it should be ours, too-is not with theory per se, but with whether the creative product exploits it successfully. Our primary question should not be "does Durrell have the intellectual authority to speak of space-time or quanta?" but rather, "to the degree that his work speaks of them, does it do so meaningfully, decorously?" One valid means of approaching Durrell is to recognize that the great novelists of this century-Conrad, Proust, Joyce, Ford, Faulkner, Woolf-are all "impressionists" reacting in some degree against the limited "naturalists" who believed, according to Edmund Wilson, that "you had only to supply your characters with a specific environ- ment and heredity and then watch their automatic reactions. ... ."3 In art, Impressionism developed as the attempt to capture and portray not objects in themselves, but rather the play of light upon objects at a single instant isolated out of the flux of time. But Impressionists felt something lacking in their approach, that they had somehow failed to "get at" the permanent nature, the Form of, say, a haystack. So they painted the haystack many times over, creating a series of stayed moments in the "life" of the haystack and the light moving upon it-something similar to the series of celluloid squares which, when flashed rapidly and consecutively on a screen, comprise a movie. The Cubists, though they conceived of themselves as reacting against the Impressionists, were actually employing an approach not unlike that of their predecessors, but carried several steps further. For one thing, they implied in their work that the concern with time was 2F. R. Leavis, New Bearings in English Poetry (Ann Arbor, Michigan, 1960), pp. 14, 24. 3 Edmund Wilson, Axel's Castle; A Study of the Imaginative Literature of 1870-1930 (London, 1961), p. 13. LAWRENCE DURRELL 33</page><page sequence="4">wrong-headed, that of course the observed object appears to alter from moment to moment, but that its essence, like a work of art or the other unaging monuments of man's intellect, remains fixed and unwavering. But they were also aware that objects, like events and people, have many sides and many voices, that they not only appear but actually are different both for every observer and for a single observer who shifts his position of observation. Their focus, then, became spatial, not tem- poral-for they sought to capture not the evanescent moment but the essence of an object by, first, abstracting it from the transience of time and, second, offering a composite which includes, in theory at least, all possible angles of vision. The crucial moment in the history of Impressionism in the British novel occurs around the turn of the century, when its two inspiriting geniuses-Ford Madox Ford and Joseph Conrad-were agreeing that only novel writing was worth doing and that a New Form for doing it was imperative. "We agreed," Ford writes, "that the general effect of a novel must be the general effect that life makes on mankind. A novel must therefore not be a narration, a report. . . We accepted without much protest the stigma: 'Impressionists' that was thrown at us. In those days Impressionists were still considered to be bad people.... But we accepted the name because ... we saw that Life did not narrate, but made impressions on our brain. We in turn, if we wished to produce on you an effect of life, must not narrate but render ... impressions."4 Early in Lord Jim, before Marlow has taken over the narration, Conrad's "objective" narrator anticipates him in his outrage over the trial proceedings: "They wanted facts. Facts! They demanded facts from him, as if facts could explain anything!"5 As in Durrell's Quartet, the more "facts" we learn the less significant they seem; it is not despite but because Mountolive tells us the most, offers the most in the way of objective, external truth, that it has least to say about Truth itself, about the essence of reality that is captured, if anywhere, in the heart and mind of the interpreter. Dowell, in Ford's The Good Soldier, asks the rock fundamental thematic question for all Impressionists-"If for nine years I have possessed a goodly apple that is rotten at the core and discover its rottenness only in nine years and six months less four days, isn't it true to say that for nine years 4 Ford Madox Ford, Joseph Conrad: A Personal Remembrance (London, 1924), pp. 180-182. 5 Joseph Conrad, Lord Jim (New York, 1963), p. 23. 34 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="5">I possessed a goodly apple?"6-a question that can be answered only by the strict naturalists. For the Impressionist, who must juxtapose the moment of discovering rottenness with the continuing reality of what has preceded it, the question admits of no answer. The great achievement of the Impressionists, however, is that their work asks such questions. If we take Impressionism as the generic term, the precipitating movement in literature as in painting, then "Stream of Conscious- ness" may be considered analogous to Cubism. Both are intensifica- tions of impressionistic technique, slicing through time to achieve an impression of time that is timeless. In his Key, Durrell cites Gide's attack on the naturalistic school's slice-of-life approach. "'The mis- take ... that school made was always to cut its slice in the same direc- tion, always lengthwise, in the direction of time. Why not cut it up and down? Or across? As for me, I don't want to cut it at all. . . . I want to put everything into my novel and not snip off my material either here or there.' That would stand as a very good working credo for the stream-of-consciousness novel," Durrell adds (Key, p. 26). Even in their pure forms-and they usually exist in conjunction- Impressionism and stream of consciousness suggest differences of em- phasis, not mutual exclusion. The former employs a dual focus, as narrators like Dowell, Marlow, and Darley probe the depths of their own understanding in an attempt to reconcile it with the inpourings of an external reality that contradicts and undercuts it. We are always most concerned with felt reality, with the impression experience makes upon the interpreting consciousness, but there can never be any doubt-as Mountolive especially demonstrates-that the external realm of events not only exists but that it has a coherence all its own. Stream of consciousness is more monolithic in its fixing upon the "stream" or flow-not of time (for that is the conventional chronological approach) but "Of Time and the River," of "All-Time" or Ia dur&amp;e--within the I-consciousness. In Proust, Richardson, Joyce, and Woolf external events scarcely matter at all; indeed there are times when we wonder whether they even exist. Although both Stephen Hero and Portrait of the Artist employ a limited third-person point of view, a significant difference is that, while the earlier Stephen is the central character, "he is merely one among many, all of whom are present objectively, that is, for the time they are present on the page they have as much validity as Stephen himself. ... in the Portrait 6 Ford Madox Ford, The Good Soldier (New York, 1955), p. 7. LAWRENCE DURRELL 35</page><page sequence="6">there is really only one character, Stephen himself, and the whole action takes place in his consciousness. Indeed, his consciousness is the novel; the other characters . . . are 'there' only insofar as they impinge upon his mind. Whatever reality they have they have through Stephen."'7 Plot, action, even character-all the old touch- stones of technique-yield to pure flow or duration in Woolf and Richardson, to mood and suggestiveness in Katherine Mansfield, to mythos and cosmic rhythms in Joyce and Lawrence, and to a poetic expansion of sensibility in all." Durrell's best writing, especially the Quartet and the Key, reveal that he is conscious heir of both Ford-Conrad Impressionism and Proust-Joyce stream of consciousness, and perhaps the most significant contemporary practitioner of experimentalism in the novel. Each of the books of the Quartet, like the sections of The Sound and the Fury, is an impressionistic rendering of an over-lapping complex of events. But "whereas the fourth section of The Sound and the Fury is in- tended ... to close the book and to point to certain values, Mount- olive merely presents itself as a public account of the public side of the Quartet. . ."9 Durrell's narrative focus, from Justine to Clea, embodies a design of subtle complexity: first, Darley's totally involved view; second, Balthazar's somewhat removed reaction to the first; third, a totally detached "objective" account; and, fourth, a recon- sideration several years removed from the fact. If Durrell truly in- tended to reveal what in actuality happened, he has gone about it in a peculiar way; the interpretations are increasingly disinterested and certain of facts, yet, simultaneously and consequently, decreasingly able to speak significantly of the events and to animate them. In fact, as truth in the narrow sense takes shape in the temporal sphere, it assumes an antagonism towards the initial impressionistic responses which it contradicts. But it cannot successfully negate or dislodge from us our impression that, somehow, Darley's pristine reaction is nearer to Truth, which resides more in appearance (felt reality or impression) than in reality itself. It is not Darley, then, but the super- ficial "facts of reality" which become the most unreliable narrator 7Walter Allen, The Modern Novel in Britain and the United States (New York, 1965), p. 4. 8 See William York Tindall, "The Stream of Consciousness," Forces in Modern British Literature, 1885-1956 (New York, 1956), pp. 187-211. 9 Howard L.

Ultimately, if we are at all sympathetically attuned, we cease trying to sort out a truth which, according to Balthazar, "is what most con- tradicts itself in time,"' and we recognize the irrelevance (the virtual nonexistence even) of external reality. For it turns out that, although the viewpoints of each of the Quartet's four parts are impressionistic, the tetralogy as a whole is not so much an Impressionistic investiga- tion of a set sequence of events as it is a stream-of-consciousness abstraction, multi-faceted and cubistic, from time and circumstance. "Durrell maintains both that if there were absolute truths we could not know them and that the question of truth itself is meaningless ... in an Einsteinian view there is no such thing as a truth without a referential system, without a human 'knower.' "" And so as a matter of course externality fails to remain viable, and ultimately only the internal flux, only the felt reality of characters like Darley and Clea, is real. Thus it is that Justine can play, in succession, the roles of femme fatale and sex goddess, of a rather bourgeois adulteress, of Mata Hari, of an Arab mendicant-without altering in essence. Darley, seeing at last the abundance of personalities the name Justine encompasses, speaks of the "valuable lesson this was, both to art and to life! I had only been attesting, in all I had written, to the power of an image which I had created involuntarily by the mere act of seeing Justine. There was no question of true or false. Nymph? Goddess? Vampire? Yes, she was all of these, and none of them. ... She was there forever, and she had never existed!" (C, p. 694) Similarly, Pursewarden's suicide is unpremeditated and even irrelevant in Justine, puzzling and inexplicable in Balthazar, the result of a conflict between loyalty to Nessim and his duty in the Foreign Office in Mountolive, and in Clea it is the culmination of his incestuous affair with Liza. From time to time other explanations are offered-for example, Purse- warden appears to reach a dead-end in art comparable to the one he has already reached in love-with the effect that the "real" explana- tion of the act ceases to matter, while the act itself gains a mythopoeic significance that renders it perhaps the focal event of the Quartet. Paradoxically, too, Pursewarden becomes a vital character only in 10 Balthazar, p. 216, in Lawrence Durrell, The Alexandria Quartet (Lon- don, 1962).

LAWRENCE DURRELL 1 37</page><page sequence="8">death, only "after" his suicide does he speak to Darley and make a strong impression upon him. As Lawrence has indicated, there is the truth of fact and the truth of truth. In the Key, Durrell writes that "under the terms of the new idea [the Einsteinian Principle of Indeterminacy] a precise knowledge of the outer world becomes an impossibility. This is because we and the outer world (subject and object) constitute a whole. If we are part of a unity we can no longer objectivize it successfully" (Key, p. 30). In the universe of relativity, "the picture which each observer makes of the world is in some degree subjective. Even if different observers all take their pictures at the same moment of time, and from the same point in space, these pictures will not be alike-unless the observers happen to be moving at the same speed" (Key, p. 28)- a complex of qualifications which, Durrell might well have added, renders identical observations impossible. "'There are only as many realities as you care to imagine' writes Pursewarden." (B, p. 315) According to Durrell, "time and the ego are the two determinants of style for the twentieth century; if one grasps the ideas about them one has, I think, the key to much that has happened" (Key, p. 117); one would have, indeed, a key to Durrell's own writings. Regarding time, Durrell's sense of its unevenness and discontinuity resembles Proust's: "There are mountainous, uncomfortable days, up which one takes an infinite time to pass, and days downward sloping, through which one can go at full tilt, singing as one goes."'2 Both recognize that velocity is a factor not of clocks and calendars, but of the reacting consciousness, and Durrell cites Bergson's "'indivisible flux of con- sciousness,"' la durde, which is made continuous only by memory and intuition (Key, pp. 116-7). "Time has become," Durrell writes, a thick opaque medium, welded to space-no longer the quickly flowing river of the Christian hymns, moving from here to there along a marked series of stages. But an always-present yet always recurring thing .... In Proust and Joyce you see something like a slow-motion camera at work. Their books do not proceed along a straight line, but in a circular manner, coiling and uncoiling upon themselves, embedded in the stagnant flux and reflux of a medium which is always changing yet always the same. This attitude towards the material of the work has its effect on character also. Characters have a significance almost independent of the actions they en- gage in: they hang above the time-track which leads from birth to action, 12 Marcel Proust, Swann's Way, trans. C. K. Scott Moncrieff (New York, 1956), p. 560. 38 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="9">and from action to death: and, spreading out time in this manner, contrib- ute a significance to everything about them. An article of clothing worn by a character becomes as significant as anything he does, or any drama he en- acts. If there is any movement at all it is circular, cyclic, and significant only because it is repeated. (Key, p. 31) Durrell has come as close here as anyone to defining what the Quartet is doing. As in the stream-of-consciousness novel, external events lose their independent existence both because the flux is internal and because, as in Eliot's Four Quartets, all time is eternally present. The Quartet, too, coils and recoils upon itself, continuously circling about unending layers of meaning that will not stay still, will not stay in place, never arriving at the still point of the turning world because, except in the heraldic universe of artistic creation, it does not exist. Characters no longer take a David Copperfield journey from Time A to Time B, but often "move" perpendicular to, or askew of, or in direct opposition to, chronological time. Objectively defined reality no longer determines the essence of personality; rather, as with the Principle of Indeterminacy, the viewer, by the very act of observation, alters and thereby creates what he observes. Life, as Balthazar tells us, imitates art, for when Pursewarden "was deeply immersed in the novel he was writing . .. he found that his ordinary life, in a distorted sort of way, was beginning to follow the curvature of his book. He explained this by saying that any concentration of the will displaces life (Archimedes' bath-water) and gives it bias in motion. Reality, he believed, was always trying to copy the imagina- tion of man, from which it derived" (B, p. 286). And when Bergson and William James-and the novelists who employ derivative or analogous concepts-emphasize that no cross- section of the flux, and certainly not the present, can be isolated, abstracted, rendered unequivocal, then man's imagination, person- ality itself, becomes similarly unstable and intractable. Personality, the manifestation of the flux, becomes as open-ended as the stream of life itself, no-faceted rather than multi-faceted. It is no wonder, then, that Georg Groddeck, the German psychologist who influenced Dur- rell, sought the indeterminate "It," that Durrell created and animated his Alexandria, for these mental constructs, hopefully vast and com- plex enough to emblematize the flux, afford a context, even an "objective correlative," for the protean nature of reality. Durrell's Alexandria is greatly indebted to Groddeck, whose It concept was vague and poetic enough to encompass all of man's seem- ingly irrational actions and thoughts, those which cannot be causally LAWRENCE DURRELL 39</page><page sequence="10">connected with the donnees of a given character. "If reality is some- how extra-causal," Durrell writes, "then a whole new vista of ideas is opened up-a territory hitherto only colonized by intuition. If the result of every experiment, of every motion of nature, is completely unforeseen and unpredictable-then everything is perpetually brand new, everything is, if you care to think of it like that, a miracle" (Key, p. 30). The It or Alexandria, then, becomes a kind of mortar which both fills the gaps and binds the disparate elements which the exigencies of story or emotion demand of the various characters. Thus, when Justine seems irrationally to seek the pain of unhappi- ness, Darley sees her action not as masochism or devious intrigue-the most obvious explanations-but as the "plotting" of the city whose true child Justine is. When her pursuit of "deeper sexual pleasures" served to warp and enfeeble Clea, Justine "was simply [being] a victim of that Oriental desire to please . . . "(B, p. 243). What is modern about Durrell's "modern love" is that, like George Meredith's, "No villain need be," for all our villains have become victims-in this case, of Alexandria. Our incessant psychologizing, like that of the Quartet's Arnauti, has tended to destroy the very concept of personal, willful evil. In The Alexandria Quartet it is meaningless to point a finger of blame at anyone, no matter how seemingly guilty, for whenever we are tempted to condemn we are reminded, first, that the supposed agent was simply an instrument of the Alexandrian will and, second, that judgment of whatever actions, motivations, consequences are in question must be suspended in any event because the viewpoint of the judge is fragmented, a fractional aspect of a multi-faceted, if not infinite, whole. The notion of place as metaphoric protagonist, or antagonist, is implicit even in Homer's Troy, and emerges as dramatically viable in such works as Shakespeare's Roman plays and Hardy's Wessex novels. Yet Durrell's conscious borrowings from Groddeck's psycho- logical explorations not only invest the pervading presence of his created place with a heightened anthropomorphism, they also help him to envisage characters whose internal make-up, as well as actions, can be viewed as products of an immediate and intense Alexandrian being. Durrell's sense of place, the most impressive sign of his unique- ness, links up at this point with the Impressionistic tradition, to which the "objective correlative" of place makes a significant contribution. For if characters partake of a vast mythical presence, if they appear as poetic aspects of a larger whole-simultaneously independent and interdependent-it is no wonder they view a fragmented reality, and 40 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="11">that the vision encompasses realms of meaning broader than narrowly circumscribed facts. For the truth of facts, Alexandria substitutes the Truth of myth and poetry, of art and love. Yet Alexandria is also a place of death and the original title of the Quartet was The Book of the Dead. Each of the books of the Quartet expends its climactic energy on the violence of literal or symbolic death: the duck hunt and supposed accidental shooting of Capodistria, the Sadean carnival and the murder of Toto de Brunel, the violent death of Narouz and the great lamentation, the near death of Clea and the loss of her hand in the waters of the dead. Scobie, Melissa, Pursewarden-and, on a lower level of significance, Cohen, Fosca, Leila-also fall victim to the Alexandrian equivalent of The Black Book's "English Death." But the notion of death, too, has altered as a consequence of the new views regarding the nature of time and reality. It is no longer stable and unequivocal; unlike those in the pre-modernist novel, characters are no longer sharply delineated entities with discernible wills and motivations moving from birth to death along a clearly defined road called life. "Time," Durrell writes, is the measure of our death-consciousness. There are other organisms, we know, which measure time by a heat-unit. They must have a different idea of death. Then there are those so-called simple cells which multiply by binary-fission-they simply divide into two. You might say one dies into two, leaving no corpse behind it as a human being does. Does the caterpil- lar die to become a moth or would you call it being born? We do not know. In some cases birth and death would seem to be almost interchangeable terms. (Key, p. 4) And thus it is that Scobie is resurrected as El Scob, Melissa is reincar- nated in Clea, and Pursewarden, despite his suicide, becomes increas- ingly vital throughout the Quartet. By means of understanding Clea, one becomes aware, finally, that the Quartet as a whole is vitally and fundamentally concerned with regeneration and maturation, the process by which art and love be- come viable. The depersonalized individual, fragmented and passive, gradually attains artistic consciousness, an enlarged range of percep- tion, even something akin to the old-fashioned sense of identity. The realization that the world of surface appearance is dying or dead is the beginning of the regenerative process for the artist seeking to go be- yond the impression of reality; and it leads him into the heraldic realm of art as myth-making in which the Quartet is written and Clea be- gins to paint with a hand that is steel yet alive. LAWRENCE DURRELL 41</page><page sequence="12">All those offered the opportunity to begin anew at the end of Clea have emerged from intense personal crisis; through Joycean epiphany they have achieved a meaningful and viable acceptance of life as it is. The final act, affirmative flight from the confines of Alex- andria, reflects the acausal "miracle" which Durrell spoke of as open- ing "a whole new vista of ideas." In the Quartet the "miracle" manifests itself as the re-emergence of personality within those long- dormant subjects of the city's greater presence, as well as the regenera- tion of the heraldic universe of artistic creation. In the end, these characters do not make the futile attempt to overcome Alexandria- rather they accept it as a fact of life, one as immutable as a force of nature; but they leave it, as they would a flooded beach or a blazing forest, when they learn that they need not choose suicide. By leaving, Durrell's regenerative coda indicates, they opt for life, and therefore for at least the possibility of meaning and value. These things will not come easily, and perhaps not at all. Durrell is too good a realist-in the best sense of the word-to offer pigeon-holing and definitive statements regarding the future. Rather, the openendedness of the Quartet (and the final Workpoints) suggests, not that all has been arranged, but that, the past and the present having accommodated themselves to each other, the future can begin to begin. Despite what Clea says, we can- not be certain Justine and Nessim, Mountolive and Liza, she and Darley, will bring peace to each other. But certainly by the novel's end we would deny neither such a possibility nor Clea's right to assert her impression of present and future. With "Once upon a time . . ." all pathways are open, and no visionary world of man's imagination re- mains artificially precluded. At least for the moment, and therefore for all time since each moment contains all time, the impeding checks have been removed; art and life are at least possible.
