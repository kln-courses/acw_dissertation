<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shin Takamatsu: The Killing Moon AA MEMBERS' ROOM AND BAR 28 APRIL -21 MAY 1988 Of all the self-possessed designers to have emerged in Japan during the last twenty years, Shin Takamatsu stands out as the most obsessive. His buildings show a meticulous attention to detail and form which is nothing less than fanatical. I can think of only two other architects in this century ? Antonio Gaudi and Bruce Goff ? who have put so much painstaking design into one building, and the results are always exhaustive, and somewhat exhausting. Like Gaudi and Goff, Takamatsu straddles cat? egories and combines exotic influences; also like these forerunners, he is fundamentally an eclec? tic, who gives each of his buildings a highly individual stamp. Most obviously, Takamatsu synthesizes the machine aesthetic of Otto Wagner and Sant'Elia in its monumental and classical form. This re? sults in a contradiction: classical/changing, and hand-crafted/mass-produced. His most well known building, the dentist's office, oddly named Ark (without Noah), is the clearest example of this aesthetic. Partly in the image of a powerful locomotive, justified because it is located near a railroad track in Kyoto, Ark also resembles some menacing apparatus ? a cross between a ray-gun and a washing machine. Seen from the building's longer side, the repetitive light-cannons suggest a curious type of amalgam which was also very much present in Sant'Elia's drawings: the powerhouse turned into a massive and militaristic temple. As Takamatsu admitted in his lecture at the AA, these skylights are still more curious, because they don't catch much light. Like many of his mechanistic forms, they are more emblematic and suggestive than func? tional. Combined with the name Ark and the building's purpose, they suggest that going to the dentist is both exquisitely painful and rejuvenat? ing ? an opposition which is characteristic of Takamatsu's metaphysics. His exhibition at the AA was named after the song 'The Killing Moon', and its logo was a sensual 'slick-tech' bayonet, the kind of instrument Mishima might have used to inspire love and dread. Other of his buildings have enigmatic names . such as 'Pharoah' (another dentist's office with round windows), 'Week', 'Exe', 'Origin m' (also called Sunmoon) and 'Links'. These labels, like the obsessive forms themselves, don't clarify the mystery; they deepen it. Takamatsu resembles those symbolist painters and poets of the late nineteenth century whose goal was to make the familiar strange, to suggest more than what is named, to create a mystical iconography without religion. Similar motives have led Takamatsu to design some anomalous buildings and to practise a form of anti-urbanism. Although his concrete and metal buildings in Kyoto are incredibly small, even jewel-like, resembling tiny futurist chapels belonging to a Nonconformist sect, they jump out of their surroundings. They are self The exhibition installation in the AA Members' Room. sufficient monuments which ask to be admired like free-standing sculpture in a park, rather than contextual designs. 'Origin III', the head office of a small company, is typical in this respect. Meticulously crafted from concrete, polished black granite and a silvery stainless steel, and surmounted by a fire-engine-red dome of squat proportions, it vibrates and gesticulates against a dull background of tiled roofs and industrial squalor. Takamatsu has had a great deal of trouble getting these alien buildings accepted in this conservative city, but he seems to relish the continual planning battles, and to gain strength from the struggle ? more spiritual exercises for his metaphysics of 'The Killing Moon'. Because the buildings are carried out with such skill and conviction, perhaps even the burghers of Kyoto admire the results. Takamatsu spends a great deal more time sketching and drawing than does any other Detail of exhibition installation, showing model of The Killing Moon. architect with a comparable number of com? missions (thirty in 1987). He covers large sheets with ink sketches of the volumes and profiles of a scheme, rather like Michael Graves's thumbnail sketches, until several suitably monumental and forbidding themes are found. These sketches are then worked up into hard-edged axonometrics, and finally into shaded pencil drawings. The results, several of which are collected in the AA's 'Folio XII', The Killing Moon, are like religious icons of death ? melancholic totems to be admired at a distance and in a mood of sombre contemplation. They are reminiscent of Hollein and Pichler's work of the early 1960s, and also of their manifesto of 1962, ominously called 'Absolute Architecture': Architecture is an embodiment of the power and longings of a few men ... It crushes those who cannot bear it . . . Architecture is elemental, sensual, prim? itive, brutal, terrible, mighty, dominating . . . Architecture is an affair of the elite . . . We make an architecture that is not determined by technology but utilizes technology, a pure absolute architecture. So does Takamatsu. But his 'absolutes', like those of Goff, always have a pixie, anthropo? morphic quality. This is due to the many symmetries in plan and elevation, the slight curves, the round 'eyes', the protrusions of 'limbs' and 'bones'. It also results from fanatical detailing, which raises his work far above abstraction. Concrete, granite and steel ? hard, precise materials ? are wrapped into each other with consideration and contrast. Part of this is just healthy fetishism, like the affection Takamatsu feels for his giant Kawasaki motor? cycle, or any good sculptor lavishes on his materials. But in a building this quality comes as a shock, especially when achieved in hard industrial materials. Here is the promise of the First Machine Aesthetic ? undiluted, creative and ever-changing. It's perhaps as much a result of Japanese hand-crafted high-tech ? the ability to improvise on site with machine tools ? as the designer's skill, but it demonstrates a truth which appears to have been forgotten in the wake of mass-production: industrial materials, in the right hands, can be as individual, sculptural and sensual as any carved stone. Hence Takamatsu, like other Japanese designers such as Itsuko Hasegawa, is producing an architecture of opposites ? anthropomorphic machines, wilful high-tech ? which symbolizes a new relationship between desire and mechanization.
