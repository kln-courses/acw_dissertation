<plain_text><page sequence="1">CRITICAL REVIEWS lief of the evangelist, but, I think, not his fun- damental thesis. I would agree, instead, with other statements in the book that Mark was an "apologia for Jesus' Messiahship," however early in his career or even before it the signs thereof were thought visible. Branscomb is quoted with an approval we would share, in the view that Mark aims to tell "the Christian story as it was known and believed in the Christian churches of the Hellenistic world a generation after Jesus' death." "Mark was not a theologian, nor even trying to be one," it is stated (p. I60), and yet he "substituted a theological idea of the person of Jesus for the Kingdom of God" (p. 256). A definition of a theologian, for the first century, is evasive; yet it does seem that if Mark was not one, then there were none, and the above negation has no meaning. Wrede's theory of the "messianic secret" is accepted, of a later "in- trusion into the tradition ... not really con- sonant with the story of Jesus as it was handed down." But is it not more likely that Jesus' messiahship was in historical fact a "secret" un- recognized by his contemporaries during his earthly life and that this perplexity found ex- planations in the earliest tradition? As to anti- Semitism, "we may exonerate Mark"; but the primitive Jewish-Christian relationship is really a specific problem somewhat aside from general anti-Semitism. Finally, a handful of secondary points in these studies may be of interest. Grant accepts the ending of Mark i6:8. He implies, as a his- torical situation, that the messiahship belief developed after the death of Jesus. He suggests that the Gospel of Matthew was prepared "as a manual.... for the religious educators of the early Syrian church"! He overlooks a great deal of textual criticism in the last sixty years when he decries that such activity "more or less came to a halt with the publication of Westcott and Hort's Greek Testament." Many are the points of profitable debate, of major and minor aspects, ably set forth in these lectures. KENNETH W. CLARK Duke University The Recovery of the Historical Paul. By ROBERT MARTYR HAWKINS. Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, I943. viii+292 pages. $3.00. Professor Robert M. Hawkins of the Vander- bilt University School of Religion joins in the quest for the historical Paul, whom he hopes to "recover" by the logical criticism of the apostle's letters. Recognizing and properly dis- missing the fault of harmonizing the letters and the narrative of Luke-Acts, Hawkins takes as his standpoint the recoverable "situation" of a given letter and then attempts to distinguish between the genuine and the spurious parts, as accretions were attributed to Paul's letters by representatives of later orthodox theological positions. Much as the attempt to discover the real Paul is welcome, it does not appear that Haw- kins has accomplished his praiseworthy objec- tive. Even though his thesis is admitted, a close perusal of his book does not reveal either a de- pendable method of procedure or an assured re- sult. This is due to the author's dependence upon the criterion of logical suitability and to his failure to generalize his conclusions. Profes- sor Hawkins professes to be aware of historical and literary research, but he brusquely dis- misses it to depend upon his mere ipse dixit of what in a Pauline letter is genuine and what is accretion. It early becomes apparent that Haw- kins has an aversion to any Jewish elements in Christianity, to redemptionist atonement theol- ogy, to apocalypticism, to homiletics, and to liturgics, which he seems to regard as unworthy of so great a religious leader as Paul. He there- fore regularly dismisses all passages in which these factors appear as ungenuine accretions to the letters. This is done without reference to religio-historical developments in Paul's histori- cal period. Doubtless, Professor Hawkins is well acquainted, for example, with Goodenough's work on mystical Judaism, but, effective as this work might be in prosecuting his analysis, he does not appear to use it-at least he does not refer to its data. Similarly, it might be expected that what Lohmeyer showed as enabling the understanding of Colossians might have been used, but no use is made of it. Upon occasion one is forced to question Hawkins' estimates. For example, he remarks of the list of vices in Romans that the list bespeaks Jewish origin. Reference to the ICC would have shown that the literary device is Hellenistic. Again, the many questions raised by the dikaios, dikaio- sune, and dikaioo terms are doubtfully an- swered; reference to Burton's word study in ICC's Galatians does not lead to confidence in Hawkins' judgments. There is more than failure to use religio- historical studies and more than hostility in- I37</page><page sequence="2">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION dicated by this procedure. One looks in vain for tangible and objectively applied literary criteria. There are vague passing references to Paul's "style" and grammar and to such con- ventionalized literary forms as the thanksgiv- ings, but the reader never observes a thorough application of any such criteria; such use as is made is only in support of the view determined by logical consideration. The inexactness of this procedure is indicated by the several compari- sons of alleged accretions with Hebrews and the Pastorals. Here, again, the reviewer has no doubt that Hawkins is acquainted with the work of Blass, Bultmann, and Harrison. How- ever, it was incumbent upon Hawkins, in sum- marily disregarding it, to prove, rather than merely to assert, his contrary position. An astonishing feature of this monograph is the author's characterization of the alleged spurious passages. They are said to be "per- verted" (pp. 276, 277), "puerile" (242), "bun- glesome" (238, 281), "not particularly intelli- gent" (248), "in utter, hopeless confusion" (55, II9), "palpable absurdity" (37), "a degeneracy of sub-Pauline thought" (io6), "sheer stupid- ity" (256), and "revolting doctrine" (I29). All that this means, of course, is that Hawkins does not like what is attributed to Paul in the pas- sages concerned. That Christianity in history found these passages effective suggests that a historical approach in seeking the historical Paul is of greater value than a professor's prejudices. The general sense of this monograph's failure to accomplish what is implied by its title is in- tensified, finally, by the failure to generalize the supposed findings. After the introductory chap- ter the book proceeds by chapters on the several letters, with the attempted distinction of the genuine from the spurious parts. Once the dis- tinction is made, in a curious sequence of the letters, the book stops. Possibly it is intended that the reader will then note the table of spuri- ous passages, dismiss them, and that with no further assistance he has "recovered" the his- torical Paul. It appears to the reviewer that he must continue to search. It reflects no credit upon the book's pub- lisher that so superb an example of format, material, and printing is issued without either a subject or a text index. DONALD W. RIDDLE U.S. Army Air Force The Anti-anthropomorphisms of the Greek Penta- teuch. By CHARLES T. FRITSCH. Princeton: Princeton University Press, I943. v+8I pages. $2.00. The Hebrew conception of God was different from the Greek; it was very anthropomorphic. How did the translators deal with the instances where God spoke, felt, and acted like a man? In dealing with their attitude, Dr. Fritsch in a careful, well-organized, clearly arranged essay shows that "in the great majority of cases .... the anthropomorphisms and anthropopathies [are] carried over into the Greek without any change" (p. 20), although "some anthropomor- phic expressions and metaphors are quite con- sistently avoided in the Greek" (p. 62.) "Quite" must be stressed, because the translators are not altogether consistent even in these cases. In the investigation of other evidences of this tendency, the author has not always kept in mind his own words: "The translators were governed not only by the desire to produce a faithful rendering of the original, but also to produce a version which reflected their knowl- edge of the Greek idiom and style as far as that was possible" (p. i6). For he adduces many cases where without any anti-anthropomorphic tendency the translators tried either to make clearer or to soften some expressions in accord- ance with their own understanding and the Greek way of expressing it. The limitation of the study to the Penta- teuch gives it too narrow a scope. The incidental reference to Frankel's suggestion that "the anti-anthropomorphic tendency is stronger in the Pentateuch than in the later books of the Greek Old Testament" (p. 25) is not enough. Neither is the mere statement enough that there are two opposing positions regarding the origin of the anti-anthropomorphic tendency and that there are "two streams of anti-anthropomor- phic development in Jewish history": the one in the Hebrew Old Testament as a result of the theological development of the Jews themselves, and the other in the LXX as due to the influence of Greek speculation and philosophy. Dr. Fritsch has not proved to my mind that this tendency in the LXX is not due to the inner Jewish development. Neither his arguments from the translation of ?'Tr by 6 Cv nor from the different psychological attitude of the trans- lators are cogent. Whether God thinks in his "heart" or in his "mind" is immaterial from the point of anthropomorphism. To see in the five Greek translations of 6 cv "the introduction of a I38</page></plain_text>
