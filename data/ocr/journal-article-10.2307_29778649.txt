<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHANGING CONCEPTIONS OF NATURE By Dr Brian Morris (Talk Given To The Society of Malawi November 27th 1990) I want in this talk to outline and discuss people's views of the Natural World, the way in which people conceptualize the world in which they live. And taking an Historical perspective, I shall outline - using appropriate quotations - three basic orientations towards nature, the COSMOLOGIC AL attitude which tends to view the world as if it were an animate being; A MECHANISTIC perspective which understands the world as if it were a machine, and finally the kind of understanding that developed towards the end oflast century, which conceptualizes die world as a kind ofhistoricalprocess. I shall call this orientation ECOLOGICAL. Finally, I shall offer some reflections on Chewa conceptions ofNature, and of Animal Life. 1. THE COSMOLOGICAL ATTITUDE TO NATURE Let me quote initially from Black Elk Speaks - the autobiography of an Oglala Sioux Indian, as recorded by John Neihardt Interestingly, when this bookwas first published (in 1932) itmetwith little response, and it had to be * 'remaindered'' by thepublishers. Republished thirty years later, inpaperback edition, when the American public hadbecome aware of environmental issues, thebookbecame abest seller-and has since become something of a classic. In the openingpages. BlackElk describes to Neihardt, the relevance of the Indian sacredpipe. He says: ' * Before we smoke, you must see how it is made and what it means. These four ribbons hanging here on the stem are the four quarters of the universe. The black one is for the west where the thunder beings live to send us rain. The white one for the north, whence comes the great white cleansing wind; the red one for the east, whence springs the light, and where the morning star lives to give men wisdom; the yellow for the south, whence comes the summer, and the power to grow.</page><page sequence="2">10 The Society ofMalawi Journal But these four spirits are only one spirit, and the eagle feather here is for that one, which is like a father, and it is also for the thoughts of men that they should rise high as the eagles do. Is not the sky the father and the earth a mother, and are not all living, with feet or wings or roots, their children? And this hide upon the mouthpiece here, which should be bison hide, is for the earth, from whence we come and at whose breast we suck as babies all our lives, along with all the animals, and birds and trees and grasses. And because it means all this, and more than any man can understand, the pipe is holy''. And when he has litthispipe, he recites a prayer-or rather, as he puts it **I said a voice", for even his own words are not described in a possessive sense. He recites: ' * Hear me, four quarters of the world - a relative I am. Give me the strength to walk the soft earth, a relative to all that is.'' This is more than justpoetry - though it ispoetic - it reflects an attitude of mind, an attitude towards the natural world. Europeans no longer think in these terms. And the attitude it expresses is essentially religious and anthropomorphic; it conceives of the world - spirits, humans and natural phenomena - as an inter-related totality. Black Elk views nature aspart of acosmic unity symbolised by a tobaccopipe which is both spiritual and animate. The 'morning star' "lives", - it is a spirit that gives men wisdom; the earth is a mother; and Black Elk sees himself as having some sort ofkin relationship with living things. As I implied, this is not simply metaphor, nor did Black Elk hold any sentimental attitudes towards nature: the Sioux were no vegetarians, and they led a rather spartan existence focused on hunting ofbuffalo on the high plains of Dakota. But significantly as a hunting and gathering people the Oglala did not see themselves as in control of the world. To the contrary: animals were under the control of spirits and the taking of game required a respectful attitude towards the animal world, for each animal had its own guardian spirit. But more important, this attitude towards nature must not be seen as some isolated case, for Black Elk's autobiography, in essence, reflects a viewpoint that is wide-spread among non-industrial communities. In fact</page><page sequence="3">Changing Conceptions ofNalure 11 it is the perspective reflected in the world-views of most pre-literate peoples, as the studies of several anthropologists have indicated. In such communities the natural world is see in anthropomorphic terms; spirits permeate matters, such that die world is seen as animate?leading some anthropologists to use the term * animism' to describe traditional religions. Within such a cosmology spirits, the social life of humans and nature cannot be compartmentalized. Naturalphenomena, for example, may be thought of as spirits; social events - especially moral transgressions - may give rise to natural calamities, via spiritual agencies; symbolic associations or transformations are made between, what to Europeans, are diverse events or entities. And common everyday things, may be invested with a deep symbolic or cosmological significance. Ali Mazrui describes this attitude, which he sees as characteristic of "Traditional" Africa, as a kind of pantheism, contrasting it both with monotheism and secularism which together constitute, he feels, the "Triple Heritage" ofAfricanpeoples. Now one does not have to read anthropology in order to find examples of such a cosmologicalperspective towards the world?you need only turn to Plato and Aristotle and to other Greekphilosophers. For Greek natural science was based on the idea that the natural world, the Universe, was animate ? a kind of living organism, not only alive but rational and intelligible. "Mind", "Psyche", was a constituent of the world, and human beings and other living creatures were simply a part of a totality, or cosmic order, that was divinely created - at least the order was so created, if not the world itself. The cosmological attitude towards the natural world was evident in Europe throughout the medievalperiod - in fact European thought itself waspermeatedby the ideas of Plato and Aristotle. The most popular book of the Middle Ages The Consolation of Philosophy by Boethius was instrumental in disseminating such ideas and it is interesting how Plato's eternal order, becomes in Boethius, Providence, the unchanging plan for the universe, in the mind of God. This kind of perspective implies three basic tenets:</page><page sequence="4">12 The Society of Malawi Journal a) the world consists of a totality of inter-related things, incorporating spirits, humankind and nature, a totality that is symbolically and meaningfully expressed. b) Nature itself is permeated with spirit, or mind; it is a living entity; the world is animate, or vital. c) There is no separation between humans and nature, or between the individual and society - but all are encompassed in a spiritual order, where everything has itsplace orpurpose. Around 300 years ago this cosmological attitude towards nature was shattered, or rather it began to disintegrate due to a series of fundamental changes in the human situation - as these unfolded in the European context 2. THE RISE OF MECHANISTIC SCIENCE There have in fact been two major upheavals in human history. The first occurred around six thousand years ago with the advent of intensive agriculture and the emergence of centralized city states. This happened independently in several areas, and the changes were quite fundamental. Although the political and social changes were profound, hence the term neolithic revolution, basic attitudes towards the world remained essentially the same. If anything, due to the emergence of a class of religious specialists or literati, cosmological ideas becoming even more elaborate andsystemizedasonequickly realises in studying the religiousphilosophies ofall the early civilizations - whether Aztec, Assyrian, Egyptian, Hindu, Buddhist or Chinese. The reason that there was little shift in conceptual ideas, was that humankind was still fundamentally tied to the land, as a productive resource. The revolutions and changes that occurred some 3 00 years ago were of quite a different order, because they wrenched apart of humankind away from any direct contact with the natural world. Such changes have been variously described. Political theorists have emphasized the rise of individualism, and the implementation of a form of government based on</page><page sequence="5">Changing Conceptions ofNature 13 some sort of democratic control. Sociologists have stressed a fundamental change in the nature of human relationships, a change from a situation where social relationships were mainly ascriptive and allegiance to kinship important to one where they are based on contract, and the crucial allegiances were political. Economic historians have discussed changes in technology, the rise of science and the emergence of capitalism. All these changes are interrelated, for what essentially occurred was a complete change in the mode and nature of production. And it has two aspects. Firstly: machines replaced land, as a primary resource or factor in production. Secondly: money, and the type of exchanges associated with barter trade - which hitherto hasbeen limited to exchanges involving goods-began to permeate all aspects of social life, for not only land but human labour itselfbecame a commodity that was bought and sold. Inevitably, and in a sense corresponding to these socio-economic changes, a shift also occurred in humans conception of nature, and in the human relationship to the universe. To illustrate this new conception of the world, I will quote again a relevant extract: "Since the Ancients esteemed the science of mechanics of greatest importance in the investigation of natural things... I have in this treatise cultivated mathematics as far as it relates to philosophy. The Ancients considered mechanics in twofold respect: as rational, which proceeds accurately by demonstration, and practical. To practical mechanics all the manual artsbelong. But... artificers do not work with perfect accuracy. However, the errors are not in the art, but in the artificers. He that works with less accuracy, is an imperfect mechanic, and if any could work with perfect accuracy, he would be the mostperfect mechanic of all". These are the opening words of Isaac Newton's book The Mathematical</page><page sequence="6">14 The Society of Malawi Journal Principles of Natural Philosophypublished in 1686, one of the most important books ever published. Both Phythagoras and Plato had seen mathematics and geometry as the key to our understanding of reality, and Newton explicitly follows this tradition, but with an important twist. For Newton the world is not seen as a living organism, but as a kind of machine, and he sees himself as a kind of super mechanic, using mathematical theorems in order to discover the workings of this machine. It is important to realise that a common sense notion of the universe ? which incorporates such concepts as space, matter, motion, bodies - was not articulated until around 1600, and constituted an important theoretical advance in our understanding of nature. But Newton was not an atheist; God had an important role to play in his schema, for Newton saw divinity as an omnipotent and omniscient being both creating and governing the world. God was the "creator of all things". As he put it: "the motions which the planets now have, could not spring from any natural course alone but were impressed by an intelligent Agent". Newton's mechanistic view of the world was shared by many earlier seventeenth centuryphilosophers, Bacon, Descartes, Hobbes inparticular, Black Elk and Plato saw the natural world as a living entity; these philosophers saw it as a machine. Both were analogical conceptions, and both derived from the social and historical circumstances ofthe respective theorists. The mechanistic conception ofnature was associated and consonant with, certain other attitudes: Firstly it implied, if the expression be allowed, that God had been kicked out of the universe or as Diderot put it, * 'Men have banished divinity from their midst; they have relegated it to a sanctuary". The Christian view of a God, standing outside the world as an omnipotentcreatorbecame the prominent idea; as Collingwood suggests, the relation of God to Nature was like that of a clock maker to a clock - not that of apotter, as implied in Ovid's account of creation,</page><page sequence="7">Changing Conceptions ofNature 15 In the next century, of course, the philosophers of the enlightenment like Diderot and D' Holbach took a further step and dispensed with the idea of God altogether, retaining a purely mechanistic conception of nature. But even at the time many Christians did not see much difference between theists and atheists. Secondly, in tune with the kind of social relationships that the capitalist economy was generating, nature itself came to be seen as a kind of commodity or utility; or in modern terms a resource to be exploited. Thirdly, man's relation to the world came to take the form of an opposition, and particularly in the writings of Francis Bacon, the notion of "man against nature" came to have salience. In fact a whole series of oppositions or dichotomies sprang from this mechanistic philosophy. If nature was a kind of machine created by god, where did humans fit into the picture? Descartes' answer was to suggest a dualistic reality consisting of two self-contained systems body and mind ? "the ghost in the machine". Fourthly, this mechanistic conception of the universe, and the associated "man against nature" postulate were consonant not only with the idea of a transcendental creator, but also with Christian premises regarding man's relation to divinity. Indeed some writers have argued that the Baconian creed, implying that man is not a part but an exploiter of nature springs from the Judeo-Christian tradition itself. And in this context it is worth quoting a relevant extract from Genesis: ' Then God said, "Let us make man in our image and likeness, to rule the fish in the sea, the birds in the heavens, the cattle and all the wild animals on earth." So God created man in his own image. Male and female he created. Godblessed them and said to them "Be fruitful and increase, fill the earth and subdue it.'" Similar sentiments are expressed in the Koran, where man is given the earth to inherit, as well as being given dominion over all of God's creation. There is indeed a significant passage in the Sura, 'The Cow', in which the angels query God's decision to place man as his "substitute"</page><page sequence="8">16 The Society of Malawi Journal on earth. They ask; "Will thou place there one who will do evil therein and shed blood?'' But God indicates to them that he alone knows all the secrets of heaven and earth, and that they shouldpay homage to Adam. You can see a very different symbolism here from that portrayed in *' Black Elk Speaks''. In the cosmological attitude to nature, the relationship of humans to nature is one of kinship or affinity. The sentiments expressed in the Bible indicate a separation and a political relation between human and nature - humans are linked directly to God, and have divine sanction to rule, or subdue nature. What is interesting about Francis Bacon is that he took this Biblical injunction seriously and on the titlepage of the second book ofhisNovum Organum (New Logic) he tells us that his aim is not only to understand nature but to give humans dominion over it; indeed in an important sense Bacon equated knowledge and power. There is with Bacon, as with Newton, a creative dimension or aspect to his philosophy, and Bacon was well aware that from the '' fountain" of mechanical knowledge * * instruments of death'' might equally well emerge, but on the whole the legacy of these seventeenth century philosophers was a rather mixed blessing. On the one hand they pioneered a naturalistic outlook towards the world (and this was important and progressive); but this was coupled with an attitude suggesting an opposition between human and nature, and that it was human destiny to subdue, control, and exploit the world as if human kind owned it. Humankind was God's chosen creature. Thus the idea one is given that Newtonian Physics made man feel insignificant is quite wrong; it gave him the feeling that his powers were unlimited. No wonder the angels complained. Fifthly: this mechanistic Philosophy harmonized well with the expanding capitalist system, and with the fact, that in the centuries that followed, Europeanpeoples began either to colonize or to assertpolitical dominance and exploit large areas of the world. The mechanistic attitude to nature therefore was embraced and articulated with emphasis and clarity by puritans, pioneers, explorers and colonists who moved into these new terrains. The literature of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries is replete with examples of this new conception of nature - the idea that</page><page sequence="9">Changing Conceptions ofNature 17 nature is an entity antagonistic to humans, and which therefore has to be subdued conquered and controlled (along with thepre-industrial peop les who were associated with the frontier). I need hardly quote from such works, but I will mention one, Samuel Baker's memoir Wild Beasts and their Ways published in 1890. Samuel Baker was a famous explorer; in fact Alan Moorehead described him as the mostprofessional explorer ever to set foot in Africa; but he was also an ardent big-game hunter. His book is full ofgood natural history - but a Hobbesian mechanistic attitude towards the natural world permeates every page. The first chapter is devoted to * * guns'', while the final chapter, where he describes nature as a *' system of terrorism'' ends with these words: ' 'No more trusty companion... can be found than a double barreled rifle.. .this professional adviser will confirm him in the theory that "the law of force will always govern the world," It's interesting this. The gun not nature is personified; and the natural world is conceptualized entirely within the terms ofstruggle, conflict and power. A more interesting example of this dichotomy between human and nature, is contained in Rudyard Kipling's classic tale The Jungle Book. Kipling was an imperialist in sentiment, and in politics ? but he was also an extremely able and sensitive writer, and heportrays better than anyone by means of a fairy tale (based on Indian folk stories) the dilemma involved in making an opposition between humans and nature. I will quote a short extractfromMowg// 's Song, the song theboy singsto thejungle folk after killing Shere Khan, the tiger. *4 Waters of the Waingunga, the Man Pack have cast me out. I did them no harm, but they were afraid of me. Why? Wolf Packye have cast me out too. Thejungle is shut to me and the village gates are shut. Why? As Mang flies between the beasts and the birds, so fly I</page><page sequence="10">18 The Society of Malawi Journal between the village and the jungle. Why? Why?" You can see here that Kipling is describing two separate and antagonistic domains; the village, the domain of men and the jungle, the world of animals, which has its own laws. But Mowgli (unlike Tarzan) is not Lord of the Jungle, but is trying to mediate the opposition. He belongs to the world of humans and when he cries, this proves to Bagheera that he is indeed a human being. But he is not sure about this; he is not certain that the village contains4 ' his own people". It is in the jungle that he finds companionship and his brothers the wolves-yet the jungle is' 'shut'' to his. So if s not surprising that the boy sings that there are'' two Mowglis'' and that his song ends with the words: ' 'My heart is heavy with the things that I do not understand''. Itisclear that in TheJungleBook Kipling is grappling with the problems and dilemmas which the Baconian doctrine of 'man against nature" generates. Are humans apart of nature? Have they any right to go around wantonly killing things? Or to claim dominion of the earth? In fact Kipling is but articulating through the media of a fairy tale, the thoughts and feelings of his generation: throughout the latterpart of the nineteenth century, writers and scholars were beginning to question the viability of the mechanistic conception of nature - both on moral and on conceptual grounds. Physicists were beginning to see that Newtonian mechanical theory was no key at all in understanding the nature of such things as light and by degrees the mechanistic conception of nature was replaced by the idea that nature was best understood as a kind of "process", or as Whiteheadput it, the change involved'' transition from space and matter as the fundamental notions to process as a complex of activity''. In Historical and Sociological Studies which were then emerging as independent disciplines, social life was essentially portrayed as achanging entity, orprocess, in which the dichotomy between the individual and society hardly made sense; writers like Mark and D?rkheim stressed that the essential nature of man implied his sociality. Also important was the</page><page sequence="11">Changing Conceptions ofNature 19 fact that throughout the nineteenth century writers and artists expressed a reaction - known as the romantic movement - against mechanism in all its forms. 3. THEECOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE But perhaps the most fundamental undermining of the mechanistic conception of nature came from biology and the rise of evolutionary theory. The theory itself had longbeen in the air, but it was the publication of Charles Darwin's Origin of Species in 1859 that gave the theory intellectual standing and respectabi lity for Darwin stressed that there was an intrinsic relationship between an organism and its environment, and thus highlighted what he thought was the mechanism of evolutionary change, namely natural selection. Darwin therefore firmly placed man in nature, and his disciple Thomas Huxley wrote an essay with the significant title 'Man 's Place in Nature'. But more important than this, Darwin restored the idea of a totality; for his theory implied that man v/aspart of a complex biotic system, and that the physical and biological realms of nature were interdependent. This new conception of nature is best described as ecological, and there is no doubt that Darwin was aprime instigator ofthis new way of looking at things. This movement ofthought had both an ethical and a theoretical dimension, but if one asks who started this movement of thought it is very difficult to give a precise answer. The term 'ecology' itselfwas coined by an influential German biologist Ernest Haeckel in 1870 and the word is derived from the Greek Oikos meaning house or home, implying that the natural world is a place one lives in, rather than a machine one tries to control. But it was not until the 1930s that ecology emerged as an identifiable academic study. If one tries to understand the rise of this new conception of nature one is therefore forced to look outside academia. For essentially what happened towards the end of the nineteenth century, under the influence of Darwinian thought, was that a number of naturalists started to break away from the two earlier traditions. Most of these writers are relatively unknown, and few of them are read nowadays.</page><page sequence="12">20 The Society of Malawi Journal Firstly There is a group of literary naturalists whose attitude towards nature was essentially religious. I will quote an extract from one of these writers, Richard Jefferies, who wrote a number of books on English country life. The extract is from his autobiography, The Story of My Heart, published when he was 34 years old, and some four years before he died of tuberculosis. He describes his feelings on climbing the Wiltshire Downs as follows: ' * I was utterly alone with the sun and the earth. Lying down on the grass, I spoke in my soul to the earth, the sun, the air, and the distant sea far beyond. I thought of the earth's firmness - I felt it bear me up: through the grassy couch there came an influence as if I could feel the great earth speaking to me. I thought of the wandering air... the air touched me and gave me something of itself. I spoke to the sea. I desired to have its strength, its mystery and glory. Then I addressed the sun, desiring the soul equivalence of his light and brilliance''. And he goes on; * 'The air, the sunlight, the night, all that surrounds me seems crowded with inexpressible powers, with the influence of souls of existences, so that I walk in the midst of immortal things.'' You will recognize in this extract, echoes of Black Elk, for Jefferies felt a mystical attachment towards the natural world. His attitude toward nature was almost religious. Yet he was an atheist and was reviled for his pantheistic leanings; moreover his mysticism was combined with an almost Baconian stress on the need for careful and close observation. Jefferies's books are simply full of detailed and accurate - essentially scientific - descriptions of nature and country life. There's nothing like this in Black Elk. Jefferies combines the feelings and sentiments implied by the cosmological or sacred vision of nature, with the scientific stance of mechanistic philosophy, devoid of its pretensions regarding man's attempt at mastery of the world. There were other writers of the same genre, one of the most important being W.H. Hudson, who in hisprecious autobiography, Far Away and</page><page sequence="13">Changing Conceptions ofNature 21 Long Ago, significantly called his own philosophy' * animism9 *. Their counterparts in America were the literary naturalists John Muir and John Burroughs, who were an important influence on later students of ecology. Both were steeped in the philosophy of transcendentalism, springing fromEmerson-aphilosophythatsawnatureasametaphorforgod.And yet both combined, like JefTeries, this religious outlook with a scientific rationalism. Secondly, there emerged a group of writers who were steeped in the American frontier spirit, that is to say, essentially they had imbibed, as youths, the Baconian or Promethean creed, that saw human creativity only in terms of man's4 'empire over the universe'' (to quote from Bacon) - but reacted against it. In other words they started out like Samuel Baker, with a a genuine interest in nature and the outdoor life but only as this was perceived in the context of power relations; and for various reasons, they abandoned the negative aspect. There is no better illustration of this than Ernest Thompson Seton'spoignanttale Trailof the SandhillStag. The story is of a long hunt in the Manitoba sandhills - and is largely autobiographical. It is a story full of good natural history, and the climax of the tale is as follows: ' 'A twig ticked in the copse. Yan slowly rose with nerve and sense at tightest tense, the gun in line - and as he rose there also rose, but fifteen feet away, a wondrous pair... of horns... and face to face they stood. Yan and the Sandhill stag. At last - at last, his life was in Yan's hands. The stag flinched not, but stood and gazed... and the rifle leaped but sank. Shoot, shoot, shootnow. This is whatyou have toiled for said a faint and fading voice. But Yan remembered that night when the snow was red with crime, and now between him and the other there he dimly saw a vision of an agonizing, dying doe, with great sad eyes, that only asked'' What harm have I done you?' *</page><page sequence="14">22 The Society ofMalawi Journal A change came over him, and every thought of murder went from Yan as they gazed into each other's eyes... Yan could not look into his eyes and take his life, and different thoughts and a wholly different concept of the stag... had come. Oh beautiful creature... We have long stood as foes, hunter and hunted, but now that is changed... We are brothers, Oh, bounding Blacktail! Go now without fear, to range thepiney hills; never more shall I follow your trail with the wild wolf rampant in my heart... I have learned what the Buddha learned". Seton was a brilliant naturalist, and he had spent his youth in the plains of Manitoba, when it was still very much a wilderness. And he had imbibed the pioneer spirit. But he was also an artist, and had apassionate interest in American-Indian culture - and countered and tempered the pioneering and die hunter attitude towards nature. Thus Seton came in his realistic stories of animal life ? the first of their kind - to depict an ecological perspective towards nature. He did not focus on animals in a kind of primitive state - as did the other fine nature-writer Charles G. D. Roberts ? but rather on the interrelationship between humans and animals, but unlike the earlier hunting tales our sympathies are drawn wholly towards the animals. There were several other naturalists that represent this kind of tradition - and three are worth mentioning. Gey Owl, William T. Hornaday, who founded the Bison Society, and George Bird Grinnell. Grinnell, like Seton, is a figure fewpeople have ever heard of, yet he did stalwart work in nature conservation. He was a brilliant anthropologist, and wrote some classic studies of the Cheyenne Indians; he was founder of the Audubon Society, and was, formany years, editor of the important American magazine (or sportsmen Forest and Stream. It is quite interesting to note in this context that the impetus for nature conservation found one of its earliest expressions through sportsmen's associations. Gamepreservation in Malawi was, in the early days, largely due to the efforts of two hunters/conservationists - Rodney Wood and G.D.Hayes.</page><page sequence="15">Changing Conceptions ofNature 23 4. CHEWA CONCEPTIONS OF NATURE Let me turn now to the Chewa Conception of nature and the animal world, and I can immediately read the thoughts of many of you. For there is a general feeling among many Europeans that the Chewa, and more generally the African attitude to wards nature is essentially a utilitarian one. Anything that moves, one said to me recently, is Nyama to a Malawian. Another pronounced that when a European sees an animal on the road at night the general tendency is to avoid it, while a Malawian, intent to obtain meat, aims to run the creature down. I vividly remember many years ago when I worked at Zoa being dumbstruck when during the height of the plucking season, three hundred pluckers all put down their baskets to avidly chase a hare (Kalulu) that had been discovered in the Tea field. The hare ended in someone's pot, for many pluckers carry their baskets with a stick that also serves as a knobkerry (Chibonga). I have even heard it said that members of the National Parks Department sometimes find it difficult to conceive of animal life except as a source of meat - or revenue. These crude stereotypes contain a kernel of truth for like all subsistence agriculturists?the early English included?the Chewa have a marked functional attitude towards the natural world. This is reflected in their basic folk categories, for their conceptualization of animals essentially focuses around two concepts; Nyama (which means meat as well as edible quadruped) and Chirombo (harmful organism). These have a close affinity to the early English categoriesofgameandbeast(which were still in general use at the middle of the present century) and have similar prototypes. The quintessential Nyama/Game are antelope and deer respectively, while the prototypical Chirombo/Beast is the hyena and wolf, andjust as the hyena (fisi) is often conceived as an evil human agent -one sing'anga I met refused to accept that hyenas couldbe anything but malevolent humans - so in the early European culture the were-wolf was equally a human expression of envy and jealousy. NowalAoughitispermissibletoacceptthatthereisamarked pragmatic outlook inherent in the Chewa conception of the natural world, this</page><page sequence="16">24 The Society of Malawi Journal pragmatism has to be put in context, and seen in relation to two important dimensions of Chewa cultural life. The first is that it has to be remembered that the Chewa historically were subsistence agriculturists, as for all subsistence agriculturists life was precarious. Howprecarious it was?and still is in some areas?is difficult for many people to understand. Not only is such agriculture highly dependent on rain, but the depredations of wild animals is a constant source of concern and anxiety. There were, for example, the larger carnivores to contend with. In the past they were a serious menace to human life. A "man-eating" lion in 1930 held the whole area around Mchinji in a "state of terror" - as one administrator described it. Within the space of a few months it had killed 36 people, mostly women, in 24 villages, sometimes killing 2 to 3 people on the same day in the same location. To deal with the problem SO policemen were drafted in from Lilongwe, Dedza and Dowa?in those days almost the entire police force of the three districts. One administrator estimated that about 50 people were killed each year in most districts of the country by lions. Then there were the maraudings of elephants. The famous, or rather infamous, Mpimbi herd that wandered along the Shire Valley from Liwonde to Urangweinthe 1920'screatedhavocanddespairwhereveritwent. Itnot only destroyed gardens, but the elephants helped themselves ? and emptied people' s grain bins (nkhokwe). The herd took not the slightest notice of the flares and the beating of drums, and people were quite helpless to counter their maraudings. As the herd was mostly of females and carried few tuskers European hunters were little interested in the herd. There is the pathetic story of one old lady who went out in the night with a lighted torch in an attempt to drive away an elephant who was raiding her nkhokwe - her whole livelihood - and was trampled to death inconsequence. Butthe most serious depredations to people'swell-being was done not by elephants, but by four animals which are still ubiquitous in Malawi - baboons, porcupines, monkeys and bush pigs. The baboons andmonkeys raided the gardens by day, the other two species by night. In the past people spent most of their time from December to April residing in the gardens in order to protect their crops. Missionaries</page><page sequence="17">Changing Conceptions ofNature 25 complained that nobody lived in the villages which were subsequently neglected, or could lead a normal life. Quite apart from their utility as food, animals therefore have for the Chewa a significance that is markedly different from that of hunter gatherers, or of people living in Urban contexts. This opposition between animals andhumansisoftendiamaticallyexpressed dum rites (CHINAMWALI). Butboth the pragmatism and the hostility towards the animal worldwhich is often expressed-in everyday life and in rituals?has to be set within the wider context of Chewa religious culture and in this an essential harmony and inter-dependence between spirits (mizimu), animals and humans is expressed, in the Chewa creation myth. The earth was originally waterless and lifeless then one day the rains came, and God (Chiuta), and the first humans and all the animals came down to earth, and in an era of abundance lived together in happiness and peace. Then one day humans accidently invented fire, which caused great concern, confusion and fear. The animals ran away from humans to the forest, while Chiuta, helped by the spider, returned to the sky, pronouncing that henceforth humans were to be mortal. An elaborate cosmology focussed around some of these essential themes, and a series of polarities not oppositions are postulated?between fire (heat) and rains (coolness), between hunting and agriculture, between women and the matrilineage, and men as affines and outsiders. But these polar oppositions, expressed in Chewa culture and ritual symbolism, form however an essential unity. And thus we have a cosmology that has affinities with that of Black Elk, and which implies, as Schoffeleers and others have suggested, a conservation ethic. 5. CONCLUSION What is needed nowadays is a double realisation. One is that the mechanistic or utilitarian attitude towards nature, which is dominant in bothEuropeanandGiewaculture,hasi^ will lead to the ultimate destruction of human life itself.</page><page sequence="18">26 The Society of Malawi Journal The other is that the notion of a spiritual unity between humans and nature, or alternatively that humans can spiritually detach themselves from the natural world, is essentially a mythical idea that cannot be sustained in an empirical world, for humans have an intrinsic organic relationship with nature, and thus only an ecological perspective will help us to understand this relationship and prove the basis for a better future for both humans and animals alike.
