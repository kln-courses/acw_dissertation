Murray It has, in these postmodern times, become a little easier to win a hearing for the suggestion that Ideologiekritik is always, in the last analysis, critique of idolatry.2 [T]he critical dimension of the theological task is to be sought in the direction of the critique of idolatry - the stripping away of the veils of self-assurance by which we seek to protect our faces from exposure to the mystery of God.3 I. Introduction For Nicholas Lash, Norris-Hulse Professor of Divinity in Cambridge from 1978-1999, theology is best understood as the critical theory of faith; as a process of 'critical reflection on Christian practice.'4 This essay explores the way in which Lash has increasingly treated of this under the category of idolatry. There are three broad move- ments to the discussion. The first explores Lash's understanding of the proper role of criticism in theology. The second focuses in on the suggestion that his recurrent references to idolatry can be taken as a hermeneutical key to understanding the core concerns in his writings. The third then considers his understanding of the specific education 1 This essay is taken from the forthcoming Idolatry: False Worship in the Bible, Early Judaism and Christianity , Stephen C.

The essay draws to a close by reflecting on the specifically ecclesiological implications of this and the ways in which Lash's concerns might appropriately be taken forwards. II. The Proper Role of Criticism in Theology As those forced 'to fight under the lash ' is how Newman was wont to describe the impossible situation of seeking to argue intelligently with liberals whilst standing under the constant, incomprehending scrutiny of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith (" Propaganda "), under whose authority the Roman Catholic commu- nity in the "mission territory" of Britain then came.5 Given such a background of association, this might seem a strange phrase with which to open a discussion of the work of Nicholas Lash. For despite his reputation for living up to his name, with a singular, nose- twitching capacity for incisive, potentially devastating critique borne of meticulous attention to detail, Lash like Newman instinctively resists the controlling strictures of overweening forms of eccle- sial authoritarianism, seeking always instead to allow for necessary 'elbow room' in theology.6 But - and here again like Newman - the space that Lash has sought to open, a space of mature freedom rather than indulgent fantasy or adolescent rebellion, is by no means devoid of all constraint and responsibility.7 Whilst authoritarian whips might be out, there is for Lash a yoke of service under which theology is properly pursued as the always needing to be renewed task of attending to what can be discerned of God's truth in the Church for the good of the world and of subjecting all claims to this effect to rigorous scrutiny. 5 See Newman, 'Letter to Emily Bowies', May 19, 1863, The Letters and Diaries of John Henry Newman , Volume XX, Charles Stephen Dessain (ed.), (London: Thomas Nelson, 1970), pp. 445-8 (p. 447); also 'Letter to Henry Wilberforce', Letters and Diaries, Volume XXIV, Charles Stephen Dessain &amp; Thomas Gomall, S.J. (eds.), (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1973), pp. 120-1 (p. 120). I am grateful to Rev Dr Michael Sharratt of Ushaw College, Durham for drawing my attention to these references. The Congregatio de Propaganda Fide was renamed in 1967 as the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples. For just a few examples of Lash's keen nose ('my suspicious nose') for detail in criticism of others, see MOH, pp. 4 (n.5), 6-7; also 'Observation, Revelation, and the Posterity of Noah', BAEOR, pp. 75-92 (p. 92). This trait can be clearer still in face-to-face exchange, a product, perhaps, of the particular academic culture to which he is habituated. A notable example of this was the 'D Society' - the Cambridge research seminar in philosophical theology chaired by the Norris-Hulse Professor - which had all the quaint gentility of a tea-party with a pack of velociraptors. On 'elbow room' in theology, see Newman, 'Letter to Emily Bowies', p. 447 and 'Letter to W. J.

Where the priestly represents the devotional heart and soul of Church life, the kingly represents its organisational reality and system of governance - its body politic as it were - and the prophetic its critical reason, or theological function.8 Each requires to be held in check by the other two. Left alone, devotion tends towards superstition, organisational acumen to authoritarianism and theology to rationalism.9 As such, theology is properly to be seen as being both doubly accountable to the lived faith of the Church and its powers of governance and, in turn, as performing the necessary role of scrutinising the prac- tice of faith and the institutional reality of the Church for signs of falsity. 10 Further, whilst the three offices might have particular affinities re- spectively with the roles of priests, bishops and theologians, they are not to be viewed as mutually exclusive descriptions of particular, dis- tinct groups within the Church so much as three all-pervasive and necessarily intertwined aspects of Christian response to the reality of God.11 Those immersed in the devotional life of the Church must also always have an eye and ear to matters of oversight and truth and will, on occasion at least, have to speak in kingly and prophetic voice alongside the priestly. Likewise, the ruler, the overseer, will appro- priately share the concerns and something of the voice of the priest and the prophet, whilst the theologiím, in turn, rightly has to have something of the sensitivities of the priest and the overseer about him/her. 8 'Christianity is at once a philosophy, a political power, and a religious rite. . .

This dual voice is also clearly evident in some of his earlier works, e.g. His Presence in the World, (London: Sheed &amp; Ward, 1968), but less so in the writings of the intervening period driven by the demands of world-class excellence in academic theology and, perhaps, the self-understanding of one who had moved out of ordained priestly ministry and into the role of lay professional theologian. 15 'Contemplation, Metaphor and Real Knowledge', BAEOR, pp. 112-131 (p. 121), referring to Rahner, 'Possible Courses for the Theology of the Future', Theological Investigations, Vol. XIII, trans, by David Bourke, (London: DLT, 1975), pp. 32-60 (pp. 40-2). 16 'Contemplation, Metaphor and Real Knowledge', p. 122. 17 See 'Life, Language and Organization', pp. 106-7. © Continuum 2007 Journal compilation © The Dominican Council/Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2007</page><page sequence="5">8 Theology and Idolatry in Nicholas Lash former. For example, in the Preface to Theology on Dover Beach, he voices the integrating conviction 'that, far from surrendering its criti- cal integrity and (relative) autonomy, Christian theological reflection only attains its own proper rigour and significance if it is continually borne in mind that such reflection is dependent upon, secondary to, Christian faith and practice.'18 This proper 'primacy of the practical' in matters of faith can, however, never dispense from the need for the 'asce s is of theological enquiry.'19 The sense is that as the 'reflexive, theoretical, second-order' quest for understanding stimulated by the language and practice of faith,20 theological analysis presupposes pre- vious constructive articulations of faith down which it abseils, testing their securities. Whilst this may, in turn, open space for subsequent constructive re-articulations, the further sense is that such creative performances lie somewhere between the priestly and the prophetic or, perhaps better, are sung in dual voice - as has just been suggested in relation to Lash's own Believing Three Ways in One God - rather than being works of critical academic theology per se.21 As he states in particularly uncompromising terms at one point: 'It is not the the- ologian's business to tell other people what, or how, to believe. His responsibilities are critical, interpretative or clarificatory rather than declaratory.'22 With this scrutinising, 'interrogative' mode of theological analy- sis to the fore, Lash's characteristic way of pursuing theology sys- tematically has never aimed at the articulation of a grand system of thought, or a ready apologetic defence of Christian faith. As he states, '...the concept of 'system', with its seductive, promethean overtones of panoramic organisation, allows the theologian too easily to lose sight of the fact that his work, like that of the philosopher, is irreducibly interrogative in character.'23 Indeed, to seek for such 18 'Preface', TODB , p. ix; also 'Doing Theology on Dover Beach', pp. 21-2; 'Continu- ity and Discontinuity', p. 33; 'Life, Language and Organization', pp. 93, 96, 98; MOH, p. 208; 'The Beginning and the End of 'Religion', BAEOR , pp. 3-25 (pp. 5-6).

Four candidates from amongst others would be: (i) an emphasis upon the lived dimension of Christian truth as a 'way of discipleship';25 (ii) an emphasis upon the ordinariness and ubiquity of experience of God;26 (iii) an understanding of the Church as sacramental of the deep story of the world;27 and (iv) an understanding of the character of Christian hope as transcending either glib optimism or closed pes- simism.28 Nor is it that Lash does not seek to think such recurrent themes through with a keen eye both to their internal coherence and their extensive coherence with whatever other relevant areas of human understanding apply. Rather, it is that like his core influences, Newman, Rahner and MacKinnon, Lash's preferred mode of the- ologizing is the essay in which he typically pursues the rigorous interrogation of particular issues and the proffering of specific pro- posals, always open to their own subsequent need of testing and potential revision. As he puts it in A Matter of Hope, 'Seriously to enquire is always, as any historian or scientist knows, to en- quire about something particular. ' 29 Again, words that he used in pp. 95-119.

In hu- man relationships, to transmute donation into possession is to exploit the other person, to deny his humanity, his transcendence, by treat- ing him as a commodity at our disposal. In the relation of faith, to transmute donation into possession is to deny the divinity, the transcendence, of God by treating his truth as a commodity at our disposal.36 Indeed, guarding against the illusion of the possession of truth could stand as a useful summary statement of Lash's critical intentions in theology; intentions he has so frequently pursued under the category of idolatry criticism that it can usefully be treated as a hermeneutical key to understanding the various con- cerns that drive his work more generally.37 This is not to claim that we have here the hidden structuring principle of Lash's oth- erwise apparently disparate writings. Nor is it to elevate idolatry over the other core themes that have also been noted as recur- ring there. It is simply to claim that attending to this particular, increasingly prominent theme in his thought offers fruitful perspec- tive on his particular understanding of the task of theology more generally. 36 Ibid., pp. 149-50; also 'Theology on Dover Beach', p. 18; 'Continuity and Discon- tinuity', TODB , p. 44; 'Criticism or Construction?', TOWE , pp. 10-11. As is explored in greater detail a little later, Lash handles the tension between the givenness and elusiveness of God that lies at the heart of Christian life through a creative reading of the Trinitar- ian dynamics of God's being and Christian faith. For related developments, see Rowan Williams, 'Trinity and Revelation', On Christian Theology , (Oxford: Blackwell, 2000), pp. 131^7; Murray, Reason, Truth and Theology , pp. 131-61. 37 In Newman on Development (1975), 'idolatry' does not appear, although there is one use of 'idolatrous' (p. 8) in citation of Newman. In TODB (1979) 'idolatrous' appears once (p. 18) and 'idolatry' twice (pp. 18, 159). In MOH (1981) 'idolatry' appears six times in 312 pages (pp. 67, 119, 158, 167 twice, 168) and 'idolatrous' three times. There are also three occasions where the notion of idolatry is under discussion without the word being used (pp. 136, 150, 183). In TOWE (1986) 'idolatry' appears eleven times (pp. 9, 11, 16, 26, 134, 135, 154, 156, 162 twice, 163), 'idolatrous' seven times (pp. 11, 26, 116, 189 twice, 190, 191) and 'idolatrously', 'idolater' and 'idolized' once apiece (pp. 195, 10, 201 respectively). In EIO (1988) 'idolatry' appears sixteen times (pp. 49, 83, 104, 160, 208, 210, 258 twice, 261, 265, 267, 268, 269, 271, 290 twice), 'idolatrous' twice (pp. 83, 210) and 'nonidolatrous' and 'idol' once apiece (pp. 226, 203). There are again many other occasions where the notion of idolatry is under discussion (e.g., pp. 167, 169). In BTWOG (1992), 'idolatry' appears ten times in 136 pages (pp. 21 twice, 93, 94 three times, 100, 101 twice, 108), 'idolatrous' twice (pp. 21, 101) and 'idolatries' and 'idols' once apiece (pp. 21, 23). In BAEOR (1996) 'idolatry' appears thirty five times (pp. x, 8, 14, 19, 21 twice, 22, 27, 50 twice, 51, 57, 60 twice, 61, 63 twice, 64, 65, 70, 88, 100, 134 twice, 173, 178, 194, 196 twice, 245 three times, 246 twice, 253), 'negative idolatry' once (p. 187), 'idolatrous' three times (pp. 21, 50, 64), 'idol' three times (pp. 63 twice, 64), 'idols' once (p. 59), 'iconolatrous' and 'iconolatry', drawing upon the work of Raimundo Panikkar, once and four times respectively (p. 61 four times).

Idolatry in View Of the many references to idolatry and cognate terms in Lash's writ- ings, few are accounted for by direct allusions to the twofold scriptural prohibition of images of God and worship of other gods and few also by citation of others' writings.38 What this suggests is that whilst the category of idolatry and the concerns it expresses are deeply rooted in the Judaeo-Christian tradition, its frequent use by Lash is not forced on him through its currency elsewhere. Rather, it is a category that in an important sense he chooses for himself and makes his own, regarding it, as its increasing prevalence throughout his writings sug- gests, as particularly well-suited to articulating the character of the human condition before God, the way of its healing in the Christian narrative and the role of theology in tending to this. Here, then, we have Lash giving voice in his own voice to the ways of worship, practice and understanding in which he is formed and out of which he teaches. In this regard his thinking can be organ- ised around four key points: that idolatry essentially consists in the mistaking of creaturely for divine reality; that such mistaking is less a matter of explicit conceptual objectification and more of where the heart is set; that idolatry lives forgetful that God is no thing at all, no more than 'religion' pertains to any particular area of experience and practice; that there are significant resources intrinsic to the Christian tradition for supporting the long march from the captivating security of idolatry to the intensely challenging freedom of the children of God - indeed, that the Christian tradition is a school in which all are set to the slow learning of the ways of God in Christ and the Spirit (see n.52 here). Each will be taken in turn. III.l Idolatry's Mistake Lying behind Lash's pervasive appeal to idolatry to refer to situa- tions far beyond the classic instances of graven images and explicit worship of competing deities is the recognition that idolatry essen- tially consists in the mistaking of some - any - particular aspect of reality as of a level of significance only properly accorded to the absolute reality of God. As he states in Easter in Ordinary, 'Idolatry takes many different forms, but what is common to them all is setting 38 For direct scriptural reference, see MOH , p. 119; 'Theory, Theology and Ideology', TOWE , p. 135; BTWOG , p. 100.

It is, Lash maintains, 'as true for religious as for other social institutions that the discourse in which we express or articulate our situation can also serve to disguise, from ourselves and from oth- ers, the reality of that situation.'45 At one point even, 'the mistaken identification of the image for the reality, the sign for the signified, the Church for the Kingdom, is the fundamental form of idolatry.'46 The real irony here is that such mistaken identification and idolatrous 39 EIO, p. 258. 40 Ibid., p. 290.

Rather, it is a question of misplaced devotion at the level of the core values, commitments and priorities that shape our lives. Behind this lies a retrieval of the language of 'God/god' and 'divinity' not as names referring to a particular 'divine' thing but as descriptive terms referring to whatever it is in practice that people do in fact worship as of paramount significance in their lives. As we find in Theology on the Way to Emmaus, 'To ask an individual, or a group, what attributes they take to be divine is to ask them what they take to be of ultimate reality and significance. It is to ask them where they ultimately put their trust; on what their hearts and hopes are set.'49 Likewise, there is here also a retrieval of worship not simply as an explicit and conscious 'religious' activity but as the more pervasive and almost always more determinative practices of service, commitment and aspiration that really constitute the fabric of our lives. In the process of articulating this understanding, Lash draws upon sources as varied as von Hügel 's view of adoration as a natural human activity to which we are all spontaneously drawn50 and Durkheim's view of religious ritual as the 'totality of [social] practices' that express the various deep commitments operative in a society. As Lash glosses in the latter regard, 'The list of religious rituals might, therefore, include: beliefs and practices protective of 'the market', or of national identity, or of the superiority of male gender. . . or of instincts, prejudices and convictions lying at the very heart of who and 47 Ibid., pp. 68, 150; also p. 59; Newman on Development , p. 1. 48 MOH, pp. 132 &amp; 158 49 "Son of God': Reflections on a Metaphor', TOWE , pp. 158-66 (p. 163); also MOH , p. 136; 'Reality, Wisdom and Delight', BAEOR , pp. 50-1; HSS , pp. 2, 10, 24, 51. 50 EIO , pp. 166-72 (p. 169). © Continuum 2007 Journal compilation © The Dominican Council/Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2007</page><page sequence="12">Theology and Idolatry in Nicholas Lash 1 5 how we take ourselves and other things to be.'51 In short, 'all human beings have their hearts set somewhere - if only on themselves.'52 We are, as he puts it, 'spontaneously idolatrous.' Moreover, given that 'For most of us, there is probably no single creature that is the object of our faith. Most of us. . . are polytheists.'53 This is the pervasive character of the human condition and given the significant difference that frequently exists between 'self-description and actuality' it fol- lows that 'none of us is so self-transparent as [ever] to know quite where, in fact, our hearts are set.'54 III. 3 God and Religion Misconstrued Now, if idolatry consists in the mistaking of particular aspects of finite creaturely reality for the absolute reality of God, this is made possible, in theological terms, by the forgetting or misunderstanding that God is not any kind of thing or object at all alongside other particular things, not even a particularly unusual kind of thing in a separate realm from other things.55 As he states, 'All attempts thus to construe the difference between God and the world fall into the trap of supposing 'God' to be one of a number of actual or possible objects of experience, expectation and discourse.'56 And once God is reduced to being a thing, even of a particular and peculiar kind, alongside other things then love of God is set in competition with other loves and rendered liable to being confused with and co-opted by them.57 But the point is that 'God is not, and can never be, one of a number of possible objects of consideration and use, nor is relationship with God one of a number of possible human loves.'58 Far from standing within the order of things, God is the 'incomprehensible mystery' on 51 'The Beginning and the End of 'Religion', p. 20, citing Emile Durkheim, 'Concerning the Definition of Religious Phenomenon', in Durkheim on Religion: A Selection of Readings and Bibliographies , (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1975), p. 88; also 'Hollow Centres and Holy Places', BAEOR, p. 190; 'Hoping Against Hope, or Abraham's Dilemma', ibid., p. 200; HSS , pp. 38-9. 52 BTWOG, p. 21; 'Reality, Wisdom and Delight', p. 50. 53 'The Beginning and the End of 'Religion', p. 21; also 'Reality, Wisdom and Delight', p. 50; BTWOG , p. 21. 54 'The Beginning and the End of 'Religion', p. 21; also MOH , p. 136.

Setting his face squarely against 'the characteristically modern belief that the subject- matter of theology is religion, and that the business of religion is with the private heart rather than the public world', Lash takes as funda- mental the classical Thomistic principle as to the unlimited extent of the theological concern to view ' all things in relationship to God, their origin and end.'60 As we find in the Frontispiece to The Beginning and End of Religion and subsequently reinforced throughout: These essays address the subject matter of theology: is it the mystery of God, and everything there is considered in relation to that mystery as source, and life, and destiny? Or is it what we call 'religion' and 'religious belief: a district of experience and language and behaviour which individuals may inhabit if they feel so inclined. . . a territory quite distinct from those we know as 'politics' and 'art', as 'science' and 'law' and 'economics'?61 In this regard Lash never tires of citing and drawing out the impli- cations of Rahner's principle to the effect that 'the experience of God must not be conceived of as though it were one particular experience among others. . ,'62 For Lash as for Rahner, '. . .each and every aspect of the human quest - in all its bewildering, uncontrollable and often conflictual diversity - is an aspect of the quest for God, even when it is not so named or characterized.'63 The implication for Lash is that 'Christian truth is not 'religious' truth, but truth sacramentally displayed and exhibited.'64 59 'Criticism or Construction?', p. 13; MOH , p. 141. 60 'Beyond the End of History?', BAEOR , p. 254 and 'Criticism or Construction?' p. 12, citing Aquinas, Summa Theologiœ, Vol. I, Theology , T.

Alternatively stated, if the task of theology extends to understanding all things in relation to God, the task of religion - of giving God what God is justly due - extends to loving and living all situations in relation to God: 'Everything we do and suffer, enact and tolerate and undergo, all the good and all the evil that we do, contribute either to our distance from or our proximity to God, either to sinfulness or holiness.'65 Again, authentic Christian ascesis in this purview consists not in a contemptuous denial of the world and suppression of all desire, driven by the erroneous assumption that 'growing in the love of God' equates with 'learning to love creatures less', but in the reorientation and liberation of desire from 'possessiveness. . . attachment. . . prédation' in order to desire things more fully in relation to God who is no thing but that upon which all things depend as source, sustainer and promised consummation.66 III. 4 Protocols Against Idolatry But if God is not a thing, how can God be spoken in our language, fitted as it is to the world of things? In Lash's words, '[H]ow can the reality of God 'appear' in our language?' and how can this be done whilst recognising that the 'obedience of faith and the language of faith' necessarily point beyond themselves to 'objects that are not directly expressible', without which recognition our language is in constant danger of descending into idolatrous anthropomorphism?67 Lash's response to such questions, again reflecting his own priori- tising of the critical dimension of the theological task, is essentially to say "By way of vigilance and continual recognition of intrinsic inadequacy." To support such a discipline of critical vigilance Lash appeals both to the external resources of philosophical, literary, historical, soci- ological and pyschological criticism which he co-opts as essential tools of theological analysis and to certain ' internal correctives', or 65 BTWOG, p. 100; also 'The Church and Christ's Freedom', TODB, p. 141; EIO, p. 165; 'Creation, Courtesy and Contemplation', p. 173. 66 'Prophecy and Peace', BAEOR, pp. 26-48 (p. 38) and 'Hoping Against Hope, or Abraham's Dilemma', p. 211. 67 MOH, pp. 141, 167; also pp. 168, 183; 'Should Christianity be Credible', TODB, p. 84. © Continuum 2007 Journal compilation © The Dominican Council/Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2007</page><page sequence="15">1 8 Theology and Idolatry in Nicholas Lash intrinsic 'protocols against idolatry', already embedded within the Christian tradition.68 Paramount here is the tradition's recurrent 'neg- ative, apophatic, agnostic dimension' that should act as an intrinsic check on all incautious anthropomorphism.69 As he writes, 'If the history of Christian faith and spirituality is a history of exuberant metaphor. . . it is - just as insistently - a history of silence, simplic- ity and iconoclasm: of a sense that what needs to be said cannot be said.'70 Again, far from the doctrine of analogy contradicting this primary sense of the inadequacy of all of our language to the reality of God, Lash follows David Burrell and others in interpreting it as maintaining that whilst our words can properly refer to God as their true subject, we cannot know in what manner they refer nor, there- fore, what exactly they mean when properly used of God.71 Further, these protocols for the disciplining of idolatry are not left at the level of vague generality but receive specific form in Christian discipleship corresponding to the tradition's core understanding of the inextricably interrelated three-fold form of God's eternal being and God's being with the world. IV. Christian Discipleship as the Education of Desire Within the Three-fold Way of God As alluded to earlier, for Lash misplaced idolatrous desiring and devo- tion describes the near all pervasive character of the human condition rather than its exceptional distortion. So also, the disillusioning and disciplining of idolatry and the associated education and reorientation of desire and devotion this implies rightly represent the core activities 68 See 'Doing Theology on Dover Beach', pp. 3-23; 'Ideology, Metaphor and Analogy', pp. 103-5; 'Theory, Theology and Ideology', pp. 134, 138; EIO, pp. 104, 261, 265; 'Con- sidering the Trinity', Modern Theology, 2 (1986), 183-96 (p. 187); 'On What Kinds of Things There Are', BAEOR, pp. 93-111 (p. 100); 'Hollow Centres and Holy Places', ibid., p. 194; 'Incarnation and Determinate Freedom, ibid., p. 246.

Indeed, as Lash intones throughout The Beginning and End of Religion and elsewhere, the religious traditions are best understood as ' schools whose pedagogy has, albeit differently in each case, the common twofold purpose of weaning us from our idolatry and purifying our desire. It is 'in these schools that we learn to use the languages in which the sense of God is clarified - languages the disciplined use of which restrains us from naming as "God" any particular fact, object, thing, image, institution, or idea'.73 Properly understood, of course, this is a pedagogy that extends beyond lessons in right thinking and right speaking to right worship. Now, as might be expected, the specifically Christian expression of this common pedagogical concern reflects the tradition's centrally defining belief in the Trinitarian reality of God and this not simply at the level of viewing the latter as the appropriate telos of right devotion beyond the disordered world of idolatrous distraction. For Lash, Christian pedagogy is not simply towards the Trinity, it is within and into the Trinity. As such, it is a pedagogy the specific patterning of which reflects the prior patterning of the three-fold being of God as inexhaustible mystery, uttered Word and outbreathed life-giving Spirit within which it unfolds. Moreover, the pattern Lash finds here is one of ceaseless mutual correction of 'each of the three principal modes of our propensity to freeze the form of relation [with God] into an object or possessed description of the nature of God.'74 Again, 'the doctrine of God's Trinity serves at one and the same time, to indicate where God is to be found and - by denying, at each point, that what we find there is to be simply identified with God - to prevent us from getting stuck in one-sidedness.'75 For example, by expressing belief in God as Creator ex nihilo, the first article of the Creed acts as a permanent reminder that 'God's silent mystery. . . is quite indecipherable, incomprehensible, unknown' in such a way as should guard against any idolatrous anthropomorphism and deluded sense of possession.76 Equally, if 72 BAEOR , p. x; also pp. 21-2, 27, 35, 37, 50, 57, 60, 173, 208; EIO, pp. 241, 248, 258-9; BTWOG, pp. 21, 54, 77, 111; HSS, pp. 5, 10, 24, 39-40, 51.

Further- more, given what he consistently maintains about the primacy of the lived, practical dimension of Christian faith over its conceptualisa- tion and reflection, it is little surprise that he looks for the exemplary expression of this pedagogy of grace not to his fellow theologians but to the saints. As he writes, 'The 'truthfulness' of Christianity, as of Marxism, is primarily a practical matter. . . Most people know this, rightly recognizing that saints are more important than theologians.'87 And again, 'it is only in the attainment of holiness. . . that the truth of the Christian doctrine of God - of the claim that authentically human existence is life lived in response to and in the presence of the holy mystery of God - can be (perhaps persuasively) display ed. '88 But to leave things here would be to individualise Christianity inap- propriately by neglecting to treat of the proper theological significance of the social, structural and political dimensions of human existence on which Lash also lays such stress. The pedagogical performance of Christian faith is not a learning in isolation but in the ways of trans- formed and transforming communion, of holiness of life together, of polity, procedure, 'structures, activities and relationships'.89 As such, it is either evidenced or not by the life and practice of the Church - the communion of saints - collectively rather than by individual holiness alone.

Conclusion In the context of exploring Lash's play upon Newman's use of the three-fold office of Christ in the Church to speak of the necessary interrelation between the priestly (devotional), prophetic (theological) and kingly (administrative) dimensions of Christian life, this essay started out by treating of Lash's understanding of the pri- marily critical function of theology, at least as properly pursued within the academic environment. The central body of the essay then traced the way in which Lash frequently treats of this theme under the cat- egory of idolatry and, with this, of the task of theology as one of idolatry critique. Here, attention was given to four points in particu- lar: (i) that idolatry consists in the mistreating of some aspect of finite, creaturely reality as of absolute significance; (ii) that this is a matter of devotion and practical priority and not simply cognitive confusion; (iii) that all such idolatrous misplacing of the heart fundamentally fails to appreciate that God is no thing at all and religion, conse- quently, no discrete area of activity and experience alongside others and (iv) that the Christian tradition has considerable resources at its core for the critical countering and disciplining of this all-pervasive idolatrous tendency. In turn, the final section of the essay attended to Lash's understanding of the specific education in right desiring and true devotion in which the Christian tradition consists. The essay culminated in appreciation of Lash's recognition of the performance of the Church, for good or ill, as Christianity's primary pedagogical resource and, with this, of the responsibility of critical theology to the constructive shaping of this performance. For his own part, Lash has published numerous short articles in places such as The Tablet commenting critically on particular aspects of ecclesial practice and offering specific proposals for their 90 MOH , p. 75, citing Marx 'The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte', Political Writings, II, Surveys from Exile , (Harmonds worth: Penguin, 1973), p. 174. 91 'Hollow Centres and Holy Places', p. 196. © Continuum 2007 Journal compilation © The Dominican Council/Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2007</page><page sequence="20">Theology and Idolatry in Nicholas Lash 23 improvement.92 Likewise, he regularly makes reference to some of the critical ecclesiological implications of his thought in the course of his more academic writings. Rarely, however, does he treat of such issues at any length. He poses the question, '[W]hat kind of community is it that might be realistically and concretely envisaged as the symbolic or sacramental expression of . . . a hope that is effectively critical of all idolatrous absolutization of particular places and times, nations and destinies, projects and policies?' and typically responds by pointing to the promise represented by the burgeoning of base ec- clesial communities 'from Latin America to Africa, from Asia to the United States.'93 Lash's is a theology that has been articulated, as his mature years have been lived, 'on the way to Emmaus';94 a theology articulated, that is, beyond the disappointing and disillusioning of great hopes for unambiguous change and refocused instead on recognising and attending to the surprising and generally only partially realised historical movements of God in Christ and the Spirit. In focussing upon Christianity as a school of learning to walk in the ways of God's freedom and, with this, upon the Church as sacra- mental of the deep human story well told, what Lash has done is to identify the lines along which the critical task of theology as a polit- ical theology of the Church should be properly pursued. In holding the aspiration for an enticing articulation of the Church as human- ity transfigured together with a grounded account of the lived reality of Church and the pragmatics of ecclesial change this would be a performance of critical theology in the vein of what Nicholas Healy has referred to as 'practical-prophetic ecclesiology.'95 In bringing the priestly (constructive devotional), prophetic (critical theological) and kingly (organisational political) voices into necessary conjunction, this would be to follow in the lines of Lash's work and to take it for- wards in the most appropriate manner, ever mindful of the inevitable partiality of all such attempts and their consequent need of perma- nent critique and potential revision. As Lash would rightly note, even when the critical is conjoined with the constructive, the task of theol- ogy is one of continual departure and only anticipated arrival. Any- thing less would be to make of theology an idol rather than idolatry's 92 E.g., 'On Not Inventing Doctrine', The Tablet, (22 March 1997), p. 367; 'A Papacy for the Future', The Tablet , (11 December 1999), pp. 1678-9; also 'Vatican II: Of Happy Memory - and Hope?', in Unfinished Journey: The Church 40 Years After Vatican II - Essays for John Wilkins, (New York &amp; London: Continuum, 2003), Austen Ivereigh (ed.), pp. 13-31. 93 'The Church's Responsibility for the Future of Humanity', TOWE , p. 191 &amp; 200; also pp. 197-201; EIO , p. 215. 94 See 'Preface', TOWE . 95 See Nicholas M.
