Susan Porter Benson University of Connecticut Fortress California, 1910-1961: From Warfare to Welfare. By Roger W. Lotchin (New York, Oxford University Press, 1992) 420 pp. $45.00 Lotchin successfully describes a critical element in the development of twentieth-century California in this important book. He previously coined the term metropolitan-military complexes to describe the political alliances that lobbied to expand military expenditures in urban areas.1 Now he provides the first comprehensive historical account of how these coalitions shaped the timing and the character of the Golden State's urbanization. Lotchin argues that the urban coalitions played a more important causal role in the creation of "Fortress California" than cli- mate, federal government initiative, technological sophistication, stra- tegic planning, or corporate cupidity. In the years from the turn of the century to World War II, the military-investment coalitions expanded California's urban growth by capturing federal bases and repair facilities, as well as by establishing research and development capacities. With the onset of the Cold War, the political clout of the growth coalitions turned "warfare into welfare" by increasing the national state subsidies that poured into California. Skeptical of social science works that stress the cold war origin, national direction, and coherence of the process by which Congress, the Pentagon, and industry allegedly imposed the garrison state on an un- willing public, Lotchin attributes the process to insistent pressure from growth-hungry municipal constituencies. Determined to test urban po- litical history studies that disclose how local elites both initiated city building proposals and dominated the agenda for urbanization, Lotchin reviews the evidence concerning military and military-related invest- ment and development in Los Angeles, San Diego, and the San Francisco Bay Area. His findings uphold the elitist hypothesis, but he also presents revealing evidence of the widespread public approval for these elite- generated policies. Refusing to attribute the militarization of urban space to larger-than-life causal forces, Lotchin emphasizes the deliberate efforts of particular individuals in and out of government whose activities created the political process by which federal policy, for the most part, followed metropolitan priorities. The author makes inspired use of two venerable theoretical tradi- tions in this reformulation of the debate over the origins and develop- i Lotchin, "The Metropolitan-Military Complex in Comparative Perspective: San Fran- cisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego, I919-1941," in Gerald D.

The influence of Wade's theory of urban imperialism is pervasive. Wade characterized competition among cities as a "drive for supremacy" that was "quite conscious, infusing an extraordinary dynamic into city growth." In this contest "the economically strongest survived and flourished, while the less successful fell behind." Lotchin uses a cognate term Darwinian City and argues that interurban competition best explains the militaristic character of California's urbanization in the twentieth century. He also draws upon pluralism, and his conclusions affirm pluralist hypotheses as formulated thirty years ago by Polsby: "the low priority Americans give to their class memberships as bases of social action; the claims of small, intense minorities are usually attended to."2 Lotchin breathes some new life into the old bodies of the theories of pluralism and urban imperialism by impressive multiarchival research into the role of key leaders from business, labor, science, and the acad- emy, as well as officials in local, state, and national government; by explicit, systematic and fair-minded consideration of alternative expla- nations drawn from competing theories; and by a convincing rhetorical style that is spirited, skeptical, and ironic. With this book, Lotchin emerges as a leading contributor to a growing body of work in American urban history that may best be characterized as critical realism, in contrast to studies informed by neo- Marxist and neo-Weberian interpretive paradigms. The author adopts a causal logic couched in terms of individuals acting according to free will versus determinism, and cities acting as independent agents versus as dependent victims of external forces. Thus, Lotchin tends to overstate metropolitan autonomy, exaggerate the unanimity within municipali- ties, and deemphasize the degree to which urban boosters in California routinely ignored city boundaries and acquired new business addresses when market opportunities proved as attractive as civic loyalty. In addition, the author does not entirely succeed in avoiding the anthropomorphic fallacy which he realizes has plagued earlier efforts to extend to cities the intentionality that can only be ascribed to human actors. Nor does this otherwise illuminating book fully answer several questions that are difficult to address by means of pluralist theory and the methodology of multiarchival documentary research.

How deep and how permanent were the benefits from military- related growth except to those in the upper reaches of the social and economic order? William Issel San Francisco State University Searchfor the American Right Wing: An Analysis of the Social Science Record, 1955-1987. By William B. Hixson, Jr. (Princeton, Princeton University Press, I992) 357 pp. $49.50 The subject matter of this book is what social scientists, and some historians, have had to say about four loosely connected groups of American right wingers in the postwar years: followers of Sen. Joseph McCarthy, "radical right" activists of the early I96os (for example, John Birch Society), backers of Gov. George Wallace, and "New Right" activists (for example, libertarians and the Moral Majority) of the I980s. Thus, I suppose a reader would classify this study as intellectual history since, for the most part, the authors of the works considered are uni- versity-based intellectuals, and it is their theories that Hixson most wishes to discuss. Another sort of intellectual history might have dealt with primary materials produced by postwar American right-wing thinkers or pamphleteers such as William Buckley, Jr., Milton Friedman, or Russell Kirk but, in this book, it is Walter Dean Burnham who appears in the index and not James Burnham. Among the topics prominently mentioned, therefore, are the the- ories of status politics proffered by Richard Hofstadter, Daniel Bell, and others, purporting to explain the rise of McCarthy and Michael Rogin's critique thereof; miscellaneous psychological and sociological portraits of John Birchers and Christian anticommunist crusaders displaying (or not displaying) "paranoid style" or "authoritarian personalities"; survey analyses of Wallace voters by Dean Burnham and Rogin, among others, and predominantly journalistic accounts of Christian fundamentalist groups of the I98os. Hixson brings to his presentation a broad sympathy with "ethnocultural" analysis as practiced by contemporary historians of American politics. Sometimes he follows the theoretical literature, and sometimes he concentrates on descriptive data. The high point of the book is a chapter-long systematic comparison of the perspectives on American right-wing politics of Seymour Martin Lipset and Rogin which, among other things, helps to locate the inspi- ration for Rogin's early work in contributions by Hartz and McConnell.1 This comparison raises interesting questions about the ways in which i Louis Hartz, The Liberal Tradition in America: An Interpretation of American Political Thought since the Revolution (New York, 1955); Grant McConnell, Private Power and American Democracy (New York, 1966).</page></plain_text>
