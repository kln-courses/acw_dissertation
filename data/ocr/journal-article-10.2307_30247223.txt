CREEL Texas Archeological Research Laboratory University of Texas at Austin Austin, TX 78758 ABSTRACT Anthropomorphic rock art figures occur frequently at rock art sites in the middle Mimbres River Valley of New Mexico. During survey in 1987, 23 sites with rock art were recorded, 11 of which have anthropomorphic figures. Most of these figures can be attributed to the Jornada Style, dated at roughly A.D. 1000- 1400. Thes figures range from full-body images to masks. The so-called Tlaloc figures have no counterpart representation on Mimbres Classic Black-on-white pottery vessels, and it is suggested that they and certain other figures might be images involved in ritual efforts to bring rain and, thus, alleviate agricultural stress. Rock art is one of the most spectacular components of the archaeological rec- ord in the Mimbres area of southwestern New Mexico, but interest in it has long been overshadowed by interest in the geometric and representational designs on painted pottery vessels from Classic Mimbres sites. Indeed, it is clear that rock art is both abundant and widely occurring, although only a few sites were known and considered by Schaafsma (1972, 1980) in her classic studies of the region's rock art. In an effort to make this portion of the prehistoric record better known, this paper presents a brief study of the anthropomorphic figures discovered and re- corded during an archaeological survey in the middle Mimbres Valley in 1987. This survey was conducted by the author in June and July, 1987, in conjunc- tion with the long-term research program on NAN Ranch by the Texas A &amp; M University archaeological field school. Survey efforts focused on the Mimbres Valley in the vicinity of the NAN Ranch Ruin (LA 15049) where the field school has conducted excavations since 1978 (Shafer 1986; Shafer and Taylor 1986). Of the 69 prehistoric sites that have been recorded by NAN project personnel in a 5- kilometer stretch of the valley, nearly one-third (23) are known to contain rock art. The numerous habitation sties in this surveyed area range in age from the Cumbre phase through Black Mountain phase, dating from around A.D. 200-1300 (Anyon and LeBlanc 1984:21-25; Anyon and others 1981). The site numbers used herein for the rock art sites are the field numbers as- signed by the NAN Ranch Project. Some of the sites had been recorded and as- signed permanent numbers by the Laboratory of Anthropology, Santa Fe; a corre- lation of NAN Project field numbers and Laboratory of Anthropology numbers is provided in the Appendix.

Although the rock art in the middle Mimbres valley has a rich and varied in- ventory of subjects, this paper focuses on anthropomorphic figures since several of them on NAN Ranch depict an image referred to as "Tlaloc" by Schaafsma (1980:237) and which she suggests was the focus of a major cult in the religious system of the Jornada and Mimbres Mogollon, around A.D. 1000-1400. Accord- ing to Schaafsma, the significance of this cult is reflected by the frequency of "Tlaloc" figures in rock art sites in southern New Mexico and adjacent portions of Texas and Chihuahua. "Tlaloc" images, as well as rock art figures (with coni- cal caps or horns) identified as Quetzalcoatl, are considered by Schaafsma (1980:235-241) to represent deities derived from Mesoamerican religions and were perhaps related to the development of Pueblo kachina cults (see also Ellis and Hammack 1968; Schaafsma and Schaafsma 1974). Because of the iconographic similarities, Schaafsma (1980:235) assumes that the image of "Tlaloc" and other so-called Mesoamerican deities were indeed of Mesoamerican origin. It has not been demonstrated, however, that the source of the Southwestern imagery was Mesoamerica rather than some early pan-regional iconographic complex ancestral to the later expressions. Since the data reported in this paper do not lend themselves to addressing this issue of origin, Schaafsma's terminology is followed here simply to facilitate comparison. PREVIOUS ROCK ART STUDIES IN THE MIMBRES AREA Several early visitors to the Mimbres area recorded rock art in the vicinity of NAN Ranch. Adolph Bandelier probably visited some of the sites reported here in 1883 while visiting the Classic Mimbres site then known as the ruin at Brockman's Mills (now known as the NAN Ranch Ruin), but none of the figures has been pub- lished (Lange and Riley 1970:183; see also Bandelier 1892:358). A few years later, in 1889-1892, Clement Webster recorded petroglyphs at sites herein refer- red to as NAN-52 and NAN-99 (Webster 1912:Figure 4 and Plate 24). In 1914, Jesse W. Fewkes visited the NAN Ranch site, and while there, re- corded some of the petroglyphs at nearby sites NAN-52 and NAN-61 (Fewkes 1914:Figure 3, lower left and lower right, respectively) as well as at NAN-78 (Anonymous 1915:Figure 73). Fewkes (1914:14-16) also recorded petroglyphs at sites in the vicinity of modern Faywood, a few kilometers south of the NAN Ruin, and at sites near Cooks Peak. Several other individuals have reported on rock art in the general vicinity of the middle Mimbres Valley; these include Cosgrove (1947), Hough (1907:86), King (1973), Schaafsma (1972, 1980), and Snodgrass (1975:166-170; 1977:302- 306). In 1981, NAN Ranch project personnel recorded some of the petroglyphs at</page><page sequence="4">1 t" Table 2. Types of Figures at NAN Rock Art Sites.

The rock art at this site was also partially recorded in 1984 for the New Mexico State Highway Department (Koczan 1984); but, with the exception of a photograph apparently taken by Fewkes (Anonymous 1915:Figure 73), none of the petroglyphs has been illustrated or described in print. In general, much of the rock art on NAN Ranch would probably be attributed to the Jornada Style as defined by Schaafsma (1972; 1980), although it is entirely possible that some of the petroglyphs date to an earlier period. The Jornada style, tentatively dated around A.D. 1000-1400 (Schaafsma 1980:Figure 140), is suc- cinctly described as follows: Masks and faces with almond eyes and abstract decoration, horns, feathers, and pointed caps; mythical beings with round staring eyes; large blanket designs; animals with bent legs and formal decorative patterns on their bodies; homed serpents; flying birds and spread- winged eagles; turtles, tadpoles, fish, and insects; corn, cloud terraces, and rainbows; these startling figures of the Jornada Style replaced the repetitious, simple figures of the earlier rock-art of this region (Schaafsma 1980:199). ANTHROPOMORPHIC FIGURES For convenience in description and discussion, the anthropomorphic rock art figures have been separated into three groups, with a fourth group comprised of possible anthropomorphic figures. The first two groups contain figures with both head and body, whereas the third group contains only face or mask figures. "Tlaloc" Figures Three petroglyphs can be confidently identified as the image referred to by Schaafsma (1980) as "Tlaloc," and a fourth may be a "Tlaloc" as well. The three definite examples (Figures 1A-C) have a trapezoidal or square head with square eyes and a rectangular or trapezoidal body filled with geometric patterns, includ- ing cloud motifs (Figure IB). These "Tlaloc" figures are large petroglyphs (about 1.0-1.6 meters in height) with relatively wide pecked lines, and all three occur at NAN-78 on vertical surfaces that face a large area of currently irrigated Mimbres River bottomland. At NAN-99, there is a petroglyph that may also be a "Tlaloc" figure (Figure 2A). Somewhat smaller than the "Tlalocs" at NAN-78, it occurs on a bluff im- mediately adjacent to the Mimbres River. As indicated in Table 2, these three definite and one possible "Tlaloc" figures occur with several other petroglyphs at NAN-78 and NAN-99. Among the more notable figures at NAN-78 are geometrics, a quadruped, what appear to be bird heads, and at least one other anthropomorph (Figure 3). At NAN-99, there is also a large quadruped, a terraced rain cloud, and rainbow (Figures 2B, C), and some petroglyphs too vague to identify. So far as is presently known, this is the only def-</page><page sequence="6">76 CREEL 1E A B D O C E Figure 1. So-called Tlaloc petroglyphs at NAN-78 and similar figures on Mimbres pottery vessels.

The quadrupeds at these two sites are by far the largest ones known in the present inventory of NAN Ranch rock art. Other Figures with Head and Body In addition to the "Tlaloc" figures, seven anthropomorphic figures with both head and body occur in the NAN sites (Figures 3A, 4A-G), no two of them alike. One of the largest, a partially exfoliated petroglyph approximately 70 cm high, occurs at NAN-78 (Figure 3A). Like the "Tlaloc" figures at the same site, this an- thropomorph has geometric patterns in the body, although the pattern is much simpler. In contrast to the "Tlalocs," this figure has both arms and legs. At NAN-49, there is a small anthropomorphic petroglyph (Figure 4A) occur- ring on the horizontal surface of a boulder. This figure is reminiscent of the widely occurring kokopelli, although it is not so identified here. The petroglyph shown in Figure 4B, from NAN-56, may represent both head and body, although it may in fact represent only a face or mask (if indeed it is even anthropomorphic). One of the petroglyphs recorded by Fewkes (1914:Figure 3D) was a small an- thropomorphic figure occurring on the vertical side of a small boulder at NAN-61. It was recorded somewhat differently by the author than by Fewkes (Figure 3C), but the reason for the difference in renderings is unclear. One of the more unusual anthropomorphic figures in the sample is that at NAN-65 where it and several other petroglyphs occur on various surfaces of boul- ders and low rock outcrops. This large figure (Figure 4E), just under a meter in length, is on the slanting surface of a boulder. With the apparent conical cap, this figure resembles other anthropomorphic figures in the Jornada Style that Schaafsma (1980:238-240) suggests may represent Quetzalcoatl. A few Classic Black-on-white sherds are scattered from the petroglyphs down the ridge slope to nearby NAN-67, a site with pottery types indicating Classic and Black Mountain Phase components. The only pictographic anthropomorph in the sample was found at NAN-94 where a red monochrome figure (Figure 4F) occurs on a vertical face about three meters above the ground surface and just outside the entrance to a small cave. This is in a relatively secluded location near the base of a steep, rocky hill. Approxi- mately 50 cm in height, this pictograph is partially obscured by a whitish deposit apparently derived from runoff. The occurrence of a Mimbres Classic Black-on- white sherd (as well as a handful of other artifacts) on the heavily vegetated slope a few meters away may indicate that the pictograph dates to the Classic period, but this is of course only a possibility. Another figure with an unusual head occurs at NAN-98 on the flat horizontal surface of a large boulder (Figure 4G). This petroglyph, about 75 cm in height,</page><page sequence="8">78 CREEL 0 10 HEAVY cm LICHEN COVER C Figure 2. Petroglyphs at NAN-99.

Sev- eral other petroglyphs occur on the boulder with this figure, including a turtle, a small quadruped, and a linear geometric reminiscent of the terraced rain cloud at NAN-99. Faces and Masks Human faces or masks are represented by three and possibly five petroglyphs, each at a different site. The well-executed petroglyph shown in Figure 4H occurs on the horizontal surface of a boulder at NAN-49 and shows, in a profile view, a man wearing an antlered deer headdress. The individual evidently is represented with a painted design on the face and possibly with a protruding tongue. A less elaborate face or mask with a conical cap and possibly a beard (Figure 4J) occurs at NAN-71 on a small outcrop along the rim of a hill overlooking the Mimbres Valley. Although most if not all of the scratched portions of the figure are believed to be part of the original, it is possible that some have been added, perhaps in the last century. The last mask or face petroglyph is a rather macabre figure (Figure 4K) on the vertical side of a boulder at NAN-79, not far from NAN-78. With its large eyes and teeth, this figure resembles the head of the "Tlaloc" illustrated in Figure 1A. The petroglyphs shown in Figures 3E and 41 may also be masks but are not definitely identified as such. Possible Anthropomorphic Figures At NAN-78, there are three relatively large petroglyphs that could possibly represent highly stylized anthropomorphic figures. The one perhaps most likely to be anthropomorphic (Figure 3B) consists of a nonbounded geometric pattern simi- lar in some respects to the "Tlaloc" figures at the same site; this petroglyph is tal- lied as a geometric "blanket" in Table 2. The petroglyph shown in Figure 3C, with spirals suggestive of eyes and curvilinear geometric design below, may also be a highly stylized anthropomorph. Lastly, the bounded curvilinear petroglyph shown in Figure 3D vaguely resembles a stylized face. DISCUSSION By its very nature, rock art is often difficult to date with much precision. Practical methods for dating the anthropomorphic figures at the NAN Ranch sites are comparison with defined rock art styles and comparison with other kinds of ar- chaeological remains that have been dated to a particular period of time. On stylis- tic grounds, much of the rock art at the NAN sites, including the anthropomorphic figures, can be attributed to the Jornada Style, generally dated by Schaafsma (1980) to around A.D. 1000-1400. More specifically, there is striking similarity</page><page sequence="10">80 CREEL A B C F E D G H Figure 3. Various petroglyphs at NAN-78 (scales vary).</page><page sequence="11">Anthropomorphic Rock Art Figures 81 between such figures as quadrupeds, turtles, and other animals in the NAN rock art and on Mimbres Classic Black-on-white pottery vessels; and it is, thus, tempt- ing to assign many of the rock art figures to the Mimbres Classic period (around A.D. 1000-1150). This possible affiliation is supported by the occurrence of Classic Black-on-white sherds at NAN-65, NAN-78, and NAN-94; these occur- rences suggest use, if not creation, of at least some of the rock art at those sites during the Classic period. Since there is little or no naturalistic representation on pottery vessels of either earlier or later phases, however, it seems logically incorrect to infer that the NAN Jornada Style rock art figures necessarily date to the Classic period. Indeed, the general lack of naturalistic figures on pottery of earlier and later phases is un- likely to reflect a correspondingly limited depiction of naturalistic figures in rock art. It is possible, therefore, that some of the Jornada Style rock art was created during the Three Circle and/or Black Mountain phases (around A.D. 750-1000 and 1150-1300, respectively). Several substantial habitation sites dating to these phases occur within one kilometer of all known rock art sites on NAN Ranch, and there are numerous earlier pithouse villages as well. It is possible, however, that during the Classic period there was an artistic flowering expressed in several mediums, including painted pottery, jewelry, and rock art. Even if this were the case, though, a general correlation of Jornada Style rock art to various depictions on Classic pottery vessels is of only limited aid in at- tempting to date the anthropomorphic rock art figures in these particular sites since relatively few of them resemble anything shown on pottery. It is useful, nonetheless, to point out certain similarities. Perhaps the most readily apparent parallel is with the deer headdress petro- glyph at NAN-49. Most notably, a Classic Black-on-white bowl from Cameron Creek Village shows a man with an antlered headdress that includes all of the deer head and neck (Bradfield 1931:Plate 76, vessel 306). Brody (1977:Figure 171) il- lustrates a Classic bowl depicting an animal and an antlered deer headdress similar to the one shown on the vessel from Cameron Creek Village. In addition, a Classic Black-on-white bowl from the Galaz Site shows a person wearing an antlered headdress, although the headdress appears to consist of only the ears and antlers of the deer (Anyon and LeBlanc 1984:Plate 137D). Other possible animal head- dresses may be depicted on a sherd and bowl from the Swarts Ruin (Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932:Plates 226Q and 230B, respectively). The NAN-49 petroglyph is reminiscent of Pueblo kachina masks with mounted deer antlers (see, for example, Bunzel 1932:Plate 43a; Fewkes 1903: Plate 41; Parsons 1929:Figure 12, Plates 28-29; White 1942:Figure 15) and of the costumes worn during the Deer Dance at various pueblos (see White 1942:Figure 31 for an illustration of a headdress costume from Santa Ana pueblo similar to that depicted by the NAN-49 petroglyph). As Parsons (1939:827) notes, a dance "in which various game animals, horned animals, are impersonated..,. appears to be</page><page sequence="12">82 CREEL A B C D F ( PECKED / PAINTED / SCRATCHED H " VAGUE K OBSCURED Figure 4.

It may well be, thus, that this petroglyph related to ac- tivities designed to maintain or increase the number of deer in the area. The petro- glyph may also have been used in rituals for ensuring success in hunting deer. Unlike the deer headdress petroglyph, the so-called "Tlaloc" and "Tlaloc"- like figures have no clear parallels in Mimbres area ceramic representation, al- though there are a few pottery vessels that show somewhat similar figures. Most similar are the figures with trapezoidal heads and large eyes on a Boldface sherd from the Swarts Site (Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932:Plate 232L), reproduced in Fi- gure lD. Shown in Figure 1E is a Boldface bowl with two figures having rectan- gular heads, large eyes, and bodies with geometric designs (taken from Fewkes 1923:Figure 12). Unlike the "Tlaloc" petroglyphs, however, these figures have arms and legs. Figures with rectangular heads and large, staring eyes are also shown on a few Classic Black-on-white bowls, but the lack of definite "Tlaloc" depictions on pottery vessels is striking. Similarly, there are no Mimbres area pottery vessels of which the author is aware that depict figures with conical caps like the petroglyph at NAN-65. Schaafsma (1980:237-239) notes that a conical cap is a frequent attribute of Que- tzalcoatl, but that he is often represented in Jornada Style rock art as a feathered or homed serpent. A few examples are known in which the homed serpent occurs on Mimbres Classic pottery vessels, and it is represented as well in the graphic arts of the Pueblo Indians. Summarizing the discussions of Ellis and Hammack (1968) and Schaafsma (1980), in Mesoamerica, Tlaloc and Quetzalcoatl (including the homed or feath- ered serpent form) were believed to control or be otherwise associated with rain. Among the Pueblos, moreover, the homed serpent is associated with rain, streams, and irrigation. If some of the NAN anthropomorphic rock art images, especially the "Tlaloc" figures, date to the Classic Period, it is quite interesting and perhaps significant that they are depicted in that medium and not, for all prac- tical purposes, on ceramics. Their representation in rock art may have been done as part of a more broadly based effort to ensure adequate rain and irrigation water for crops. In her study of contemporary Zuni perceptions of rock art, Young (1982:183) notes that rock art sites are often considered to be powerful places. This is espe- cially true of sites with rock art images that are believed to invoke power to effect such desired objectives as rain for crops and successful hunting. Young notes further that, "If rock art images have power, a power which can be imparted to the places where they are made, then several images placed in close proximity to one another might make that place even more powerful" (Young 1982:184). It may be important, thus, that several "Tlaloc" figures and other large petroglyphs occur at NAN-78, overlooking irrigated bottomland in the Mimbres valley. The occur- rence of several "Tlaloc" images is perhaps indicative of the special importance of that particular site/location in ritual efforts to ensure rain.</page><page sequence="14">84 CREEL In this regard, several researchers (Blake and others 1986; Herrington 1979, 1980; LeBlanc 1983; and Minnis 1985) believe that the Classic Mimbres phase population increased to the extent that its resource base became strained. This strain is thought to have led to intensification of agricultural practices through water control and to use of less productive farm land. Do some of the anthropo- morphic and other rock art figures reflect ritual efforts to alleviate that stress? Many of the anthropomorphic rock art figures may well have been important in rituals conducted to ensure adequate rain and perhaps irrigation water for crops. It would be useful to know if such rock art figures occur wholly or predominantly in areas with relatively lower average precipitation. Such areas would require a certain amount of rain for successful alluvial fan agriculture or for use of water control features such as irrigation ditches. If the occurrence of certain anthro- pomorphic rock art figures is restricted to the drier areas (lower elevations), is their age reflected by their co-occurrence with habitation sites of specific phases? Such questions cannot be answered with the presently available information on NAN Ranch rock art, but it is likely that a larger inventory and study of rock art in the region will yield distributional data that will complement our current under- standing of the archaeological record of the Mimbres area and perhaps help us rec- ognize other patterns in that record.

The rock art reported here was recorded as part of Texas A &amp; M University's archaeological field school on NAN Ranch, directed by Harry Shafer. Financial support for the project was provided by C. A. and Margaret Hinton and the contributions of several volunteers. Elizabeth Mitchell cheerfully helped record several of the petroglyphs, and Ann Creel helped prepare drawings from photographs of various petroglyphs. Harry Shafer and Marianne Marek assisted in numerous ways, especially in supplying research materials. LaVerne Herrington lent many references, personal records, and photographs that were of considerable aid in this study. Tony Ramirez did an excellent job of redrafting Figure 1. NAN Ranch foreman Harlie Cox and his wife, Linda, were always helpful and provided a vehicle for use on one occasion when the Mimbres River was running too high to drive across. Orlando Romero at the Museum of New Mexico History Library provided photocopies of Adolph Bandelier's original journal. An anonymous reviewer also provided useful comments and suggestions for improving the manuscript. REFERENCES CITED Anonymous 1915 Prehistoric Remains in New Mexico.
