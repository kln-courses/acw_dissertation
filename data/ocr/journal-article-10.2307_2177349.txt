The Executive Committee reported that two invitations had been extended to the Association for its next meeting, and presented a number of suggestions concerning future meetings. The decision as to the place and arrangements for the next meeting was referred to the Executive Committee with power, but with instructions to consider the feasibility of meeting with certain other Associations, notably the Economic and Political Science Associations and the Society of American Naturalists in order to hold joint sessions with them. The report of the Committee on Early American Philosophers was read by Professor Gardiner and accepted, and the Committee was continued. The thanks of the Association were extended to the Com- mittee for its generous services. The report of the Committee is given in full below. The report of the Committee consisting of Professors Ormond, Dewey, and Perry, appointed to prepare a Memorial to the late Pro- fessor William James, was read by Professor Dewey and was adopted by a rising vote. The report is given in full below. The Executive Committee reported that in accordance with Article V of the Constitution it proposed the following two amendments tQ the Constitution, these amendments to be voted upon at the next meeting of the Association: To replace, as Section 2, the present Section 2 of Article 2: There shall be two classes of members, regular members and associate mem- bers. Regular members shall be entitled to all the privileges of the Association. Associate members shall be entitled to all the privileges of the Association except voice and vote in its meetings. Election to active membership shall be limited to persons professionally engaged</page><page sequence="3">No. 2.1 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION. 19I in the teaching or study of Philosophy whose academic rank is above that of assistant, and to such other persons as in the opinion of the Executive Committee shall have published contributions of substantial value to Philosophy. All who are members of the Association prior to January ist, 1913, shall be active members. As Section 3 of Article 2: The annual dues of active members shall be one dollar, of associate members three dollars, failure in payment of which for three consecutive years shall ipso facto cause membership to cease. On recommendation of the Executive Committee it was voted to continue the present committee on the general discussion, this com- mittee to have power to determine the subject of discussion for the next meeting, to arrange for the discussion, and to formulate a report prior to the next meeting, involving general points to be discussed. It was voted, further, that the expenses of this committee be de- frayed by the Association in an amount not to exceed $50.00. The thanks of the Association were extended to the Harvard Colleagues and various friends for their generous hospitality in entertaining the members of the Association at this meeting. Respectfully submitted, EDWARD G. SPAULDING, Secretary. REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON EARLY AMERICAN PHILOSOPHERS. Professor Gardiner reported for the Committee on Early American Philosophers that the first volume of the projected series of publications was now in press, namely, Witherspoon's Lectures on Moral Philosophy, edited by Professor V. Lansing Collins, of Princeton University, and published by the Princeton University Press under the auspices of the Association; that Johnson's Elements of Philosophy, to be published by the Columbia University Press, was being edited by Professor Woodbridge; and that efforts were being made, with some prospect of success, to secure the publication of some other works, of a similarly representative character. Also, that the card catalogue of Early American Philosophy (down to i876), prepared by Professor Riley, now included over a thousand titles and would probably be completed by the next meeting. Of the $75 appropriated by the Association the Committee has expended $51.50, chiefly in the preparation of the catalogue, leaving a balance of $23.50.</page><page sequence="4">192 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXI. WILLIAM JAMES. A Minute Prepared for the American Philosophical Association. The position of William James in the realm of letters, science and philosophy was unique. By his articles in the eighties and his book in the nineties, he won a place as one among the few founders of distinctively modern psychology. So far as the English speaking world was concerned he was easily its leader. Certain aspects of that science, such as the theory of the emotions, the stream of conscious- ness, space perception, the importance of motor factors in mental life, the psychology of relations, will, doubtless be permanently associated with his name. Twelve years after, the publication of his lectures on the Varieties of Religious Experience revealed him as a pioneer in the psychological treatment of religious phenomena. Five years after this time, his lectures on Pragmatism brought one of the most vital and most discussed movements in contemporary philosophy into the focus of attention. To few men and probably to no other American has it been given to be a leader in three distinctive directions. That his reputation was at least as great in Europe and Spanish America as in his own country is attested by the translations of his works into French, German, Italian, Russian, Danish and Polish, and by the multitude of academic honors that flowed to him from foreign sources. Probably among contemporary American men of science only Simon Newcomb was as well known, while in general intellectual fame he ranked with Emerson. The uniqueness of his position and career makes it unnecessary as, indeed, it renders it impossible for your Committee to do more than present the obvious external facts of his life. William James was born in New York City on January II, i842. He was the oldest son of the well-known interpreter of the theology and morals of Swedenborg, Henry James. -He studied with tutors in London and Paris, and afterwards attended the college of Boulogne in i857-58, and the University of Geneva in i859-60. The winter of i86o-6i was devoted mainly to the study of painting with William M. Hunt, at Newport, Rhode Island. But his scientific interests, which had been strong from boyhood, finally asserted themselves, and in i86i he entered the Lawrence Scientific School at Harvard. Here he spent two years in the study of chemistry and anatomy. In the year i863-64 he entered the Harvard Medical School, where he received the M.D. degree in I869. But his medical studies were</page><page sequence="5">No. 2.] AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION. 193 frequently interrupted. In April, i865, he went to Brazil with Louis Agassiz as a member of the Thayer Expedition, and remained for over a year. The winter of i867-68 was spent abroad, mainly in the study of physiology at Berlin University; and shortly after, he studied with Agassiz at the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology. It is not too much to suppose that the irregularity of Mr. James's education-irregularity from the conventional point of view-accorded with his temperament and was favorable to the development of his genius. Conceivably his freedom had something to do with his life- long distrust of over-regimentation, his aversion to certain tendencies in current American university administration, and with his devotion to his university, Harvard, as upon the whole less inimical to indi- viduality of intellect than other American institutions of learning, a sentiment to which he gave forcible expression when he said: "As a nursery for independent and lonely thinkers I do believe that Har- vard is in the van. . . . Our undisciplinables are our proudest prod- uct." We also have the word of Mr. James that the influence of Agassiz upon him was deep and permanent. In his address upon the latter he says: "We cannot all escape from being abstractionists. I myself, for instance, have never been able to escape; but the hours I spent with Agassiz so taught me the difference between all possible abstractionists and all livers in the light of the world's concrete fulness, that I have never been able to forget it. Both kinds of minds have their place in the infinite design, but there can be no question as to which kind lies the nearer to the divine type of thinking." In i872, his father having meanwhile removed to Cambridge, he began his academic career as Instructor in Physiology in Harvard College. During the years i873-76 he was Instructor in Anatomy and Physiology, and from i876 to i88o Assistant Professor of Physiology. As early as i875 he offered graduate instruction on "The Relation between Physiology and Psychology," and conducted experiments in a room in the Lawrence Scientific School that may fairly be called the first psychological laboratory in America. In the year i877-78 he added an undergraduate course on Psychology, and delivered a series of lectures on this subject at Johns Hopkins University. At the same time he began to publish articles in The Journal of Speculative Philos- ophy, in Mind, and in La Critique Philosophique. These articles contain the substance of many of his later views. In the year i879-80 he gave his first philosophical course, on "The Philosophy of Evolu- tion," and permanently abandoned the teaching of anatomy and physiology.</page><page sequence="6">194 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXI. He became Assistant Professor of Philosophy in i88o, Professor of Philosophy in i885, and of Psychology in i889. In i885 he edited the "Literary Remains" of his distinguished father, prefixing a char- acteristic introduction. This decade, however, was notable for the series of original articles on psychological topics, contributed for the most part to the English review Mind, in this field. Some of his most famous philosophical essays were also published during the same period, and then, as later, he recognized no sharp division of these two interests. The "Principles of Psychology" appeared in i890. His "Briefer Psychology" was published in i892, and soon was almost universally used as a text-book in American colleges. He retired from the Directorship of the psychological laboratory in i892. In i894-95, be was President of the original British Society for Psychical Research, having in i884 taken part in founding the American Society of that name. In i897 his academic title was changed from Professor of Psychology to Professor of Philosophy. The same year he gathered together a variety of philosophical essays and addresses, to which he affixed the title of "The Will to Believe," from an address which he had given the year before. In its preface he definitely announced his philosophic position as that of Pluralism and Radical Empiricism. In i898 was delivered and published his Ingersoll Lecture on "Human Immortality," while the following year he published his "Talks to Teachers," based on lectures he had given to various educational gatherings. In i898 he delivered before the Philosophical Union of the University of California a lecture entitled " Philosophical Conceptions and Practical Results "-an address to become famous as the introduction of Pragmatism under that name, Mr. C. S. Pierce, its originator, having used the term only in con- versation. In i899 Professor James's health was seriously impaired. A weak- ness of the heart due probably to over-exertion in the Adirondack Mountains, made it necessary for him to secure leave .of absence from Harvard during the years i899-i90i. He was never able, after this time, to give more than a single course at Harvard, nor to work without a sense of physical inability. Yet the following years were the years of his philosophic fruition. He was obliged to postpone the delivery of the Gifford Lectures on Natural Theology from i899 to 1901-2. They were published the latter year, with the title "Varieties of Religious Experience." In 1905 he made a memorable visit to Italy, where from the very first recognition of his psychological and philo- sophical work had been generous and widespread. In I896 he was</page><page sequence="7">No. 2.] AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION. 195 Acting Professor of Philosophy in Leland Stanford Jr. University. In the same year, he gave at the Lowell Institute in Boston his lectures on "Pragmatism, a New Name for some Old Ways of Thinking," which he published the next year after having repeated them at Columbia University. In I907 he gave up his active teaching connec- tion with Harvard. In i908 he was Hibbert Lecturer on Philosophy at Manchester College, Oxford, and gave in the spring of the year (repeating them in the autumn at Harvard University) a course of lectures, published in i909 as "The Pluralistic Universe." The same year, he gathered together and published his replies to various critics of pragmatism under the title "The Meaning of Truth." He was en- gaged in the preparation of a text-book introduction to philosophy, a work upon which he continued to work during his final illness which became acute in Europe during the summer of i910. He died at his summer home, Chocorua, New Hampshire, soon after his return, on August 26, i910. In i9ii appeared his unfinished text-book, edited by Dr. H. N. Kallen and Mr. Henry James, Jr., with the title "Some Problems of Philosophy." During the same year, Mr. Henry James, Jr., collected and edited a series of his more personal addresses and articles, together with some of his educational addresses and his popular articles, under the caption "Memories and Studies." His contributions to philosophy upon a World of Pure Experience, not already reprinted, will appear shortly in a volume. The recognition of Mr. James's eminence was as authoritative and honorable as it was widespread. He was the recipient of the following honorary degrees: Ph. D. and Litt. D. (Padua) I 893; LL. D. (Princeton) i896, (Edinburgh) I902, (Harvard) I903; Litt.D. (Durham) i908; Sc.D. (Oxford) i908; Sc.Nat.D. (Geneva) i909. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, an honorary member of the New York Academy of Science, and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was a corresponding member of the Kbnigliche Akademie der Wissenschaften (Berlin), and of the British Academy. He was a foreign or honorary member of the Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskab (Copenhagen), of the Psychological Society of the University of Moscow, of the Reale Instituto Lombardo di Scienze e Lettere (Milan), and of the Reale Accademia dei Lincei (Rome); and in the winter before he died he was elected to the Institute of France as a foreign member'of the Academie des Sciences Morales et Politiques. He was president of the Society for Psychical Research in i894 and i895, of the American Psychological Association in i894 and I904, of the American Naturalists and of the American</page><page sequence="8">I96 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXI. Philosophical Association in i906, and was at the time of his death president of the International Psychological Congress. The personality of William James was as unique as his intellectual career. He conveyed the sense of himself with extraordinary verve and truthfulness to all with whom he came in contact. To begin to convey to those who did not know him any intimation of that fullness of being which overflowed at every point of his life would require that combination of powers of insight and of artistic portrayal which were Mr. James's own possession. Fortunately no attempt of that nature is required in the presence of this Association. We all knew him and we all loved him. We can but record our sense of what we, as a guild of philosophers, owe to him. As has been noted over and over again, all the world esteems philosophy more highly because William James practised it. The number of individuals to whom as individuals he addressed words of cheer and encouraging recognition is almost as extensive as those who attempted anything in this field. If our relations to one another as teachers and writers is marked by a reasonable degree of sweetness and light, and if our controversies are upon the whole carried on without acrimony and pettiness, who shall say how much of this we owe to the silent constant influence of the generosity and candor of Mr. James. In his address on Agassiz, Mr. James remarks: "The truth of things is after all their living fullness." The concrete import of such a remark, summarizing, as it does, all that is most native to Mr. James's thinking, depends upon him who himself lives the full- ness of things. Few have lived the fullness of things as fully, as veraciously, as courageously as he whose association with this Society will endure chief among its honors and inspirations. What Kind of Realism. DURANT DRAKE. An epistemologically monistic realism can not give us a single homogeneous order of objects. Different people's perceived-objects have incompatible qualities; on this theory they are all telescoped into the one place where the real object is. Worse yet, in some cases the real-object has disappeared and its place been filled by some other real object, which thus occupies at the same moment of time the same spot with these alien perceived-objects. This superposition of objects, whereby no one has exclusive right'to the place it occupies is avoided by an epistemologically dualistic realism, which considers cases of per- ception as cases of concomitant variation, wherein the perceived-object varies with, acts as a functional substitute for, and so may be said to represent, the real-object.</page><page sequence="9">No. 2.] AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION. I97 Perceived-objects are, upon this theory, as real as real-objects; but they are not those particular real objects which they represent. They exist in the brain; that is, as real objects, they are represented in their turn, by those perceived-objects which we call (certain) brain-events. In such a case of perceiving a brain-perception-event there would be a second case of concomitant variation. Thus the apparent difficulty of identifying perceived-object with (real) brain- event does not exist upon this theory. Consciousness is then not a peculiar substance but a group of specially interconnected elements (similar in general to those making up the rest of the universe), existing wherever a mechanism of repre- sentation and reaction of the peculiar brain-type has been developed. A consciousness is that real object which corresponds to the perceived- object we call a brain; while the latter is also a real-object, a part of a second consciousness. The universe is a single homogeneous real-order, represented by our order of perceived and perceptible objects. In the former, consciousnesses exist at the points where, in the latter, brains exist. The Determination of the Real. J. E. CREIGHTON. Philosophy is not concerned to demonstrate the existence of a real world, or even to assign logical reasons for our belief in reality. Its genuine problem is to determine the nature of the real. In order to discover a fruitful point of departure for this undertaking, it is necessary to look to the development of problems in the history of philosophy. The logic of the modern systems seems to justify us in regarding experience as involving both a real world which is pro- gressively being determined, and a mind through which these deter- minations become known. The mind, however, has its reality only in and through its relation to objects; while the order of nature has a reality that is independent of and in some sense prior to any finite knower. This does not, however, predetermine in any way the character of our metaphysical result, which must depend upon what final interpretation we are obliged to give of the nature of reality. At the outset and throughout our philosophizing, it is essential to hold fast both the subjective and objective aspects of experience, rejecting at once subjectivism and objectivism, two superficially opposed, but closely related views, which both refute themselves. In the knowing process, the relation of the mind to the world of real objects reveals itself as inner and essential. This does not mean, however, that things are 'reduced' to qualities in a mind or that the</page><page sequence="10">198 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXI. difference between the two sides of experience disappears. The 'idea' is the true interpretation of the object, the revelation of its nature; but it is not abstractly or numerically identical with the object. Further, neither the real object nor the experience in which it is known can be regarded as an' immediate,' which excludes mediation. Neither in the perceptions of ordinary experience nor in the results of the special sciences do we find any such 'immediate.' The special sciences of nature deal with 'objects,' abstracting from the knowing process. Philosophy must restore to experience as thus 'objectified' its concreteness and fluidity, by reinterpreting its results in the light of the critical development of the categories of consciousness. Dogmatism vs. Criticism. WALTER T. MARVIN. The purpose of this paper is to show that the fundamental tendency in the neo-realistic movement is a return to dogmatism, to dogmatism not in the specific sense of the I7th century rationalism, but in the generic sense of the contradictory of criticism (whether Kantian or not). That is, the issue between realism and idealism to-day is not chiefly regarding this or that epistemological doctrine, but regarding the logical position of epistemology among the sciences. For the idealist, epistemology is the fundamental science; for the realist, it is simply one of the special sciences and is not fundamental. The philosophers whom I wish to convince that this is the funda- mental tendency of realism are not only the pragmatists, neo-Kant- ians, Hegelians and other idealists, but also those fellow realists who hold an opposite opinion. My line of argument is as follows: If we take the prominent doctrines or, at least, tendencies of contem- porary realists, they indicate a general prejudice which may be summed up in the statement: The most certain body of knowledge in our pos- session to-day is that of the exact and physical sciences and the most certain basis for metaphysics is the principles, postulates and all presuppositions of these sciences. In detail: There is first the tendency toward empiricism (the trial and error method as against absolutism or the a priori method). This indicates that we have no ultimate means of criticizing or prescribing the path which science must follow. In its line a science is ultimate. Secondly, there is a strong opposition against the substance-attribute notion as fundamental. Monistic idealism still holds to it. Science has been more and more widely rejecting it as time goes on, beginning with the days of Galileo. Here too realism seems to be following the leadership of science. Thirdly, modern realism defends analysis</page><page sequence="11">No. 2.] AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION. I99 and is pluralistically inclined. This tendency too seems to be con- trolled by a conviction that the procedure of science is both correct and fundamental. Finally the realist regards logic as fundamental, as does science. He sees in formal logic one of the bases of all modern science and believes that the monistic idealist's attitude toward it would, if lived up to, be detrimental to science. Finally the realist's metaphysical procedure is taking on, more and more, the form of a logical analysis of science. This again shows a readiness to accept the metaphysics implicit in science. DIsCUSSION: The Relation of Consciousness and Object in Sense Perception. W. P. MONTAGUE. The principal argument in support of the neo-realistic theory de- scribed in the report of the Committee as "epistemological monism and realism," is based on the familiar facts of common sense and of science, particularly of physiology. These facts collectively testify to the secondary or derived character of any individual consciousness and hence of all individual consciousnesses. The origin and con- tinuance of a consciousness depend upon a peculiar interaction of a living organism with its environment. To deny that the organism and its environing objects exist prior to and subsequent to that intermittent relation between them which constitutes consciousness would make physiological psychology meaningless. Consciousness cannot be the condition for the existence of its objects (one of which is the organism) for the simple reason that it is itself demonstrably dependent upon a relation between those objects. The failure of idealists to accept this conclusion has been due in the first place to an equivocal use of such terms as idea and perception. These words are used to denote acts of perceiving or thinking and then by a kind of metonymy they are used also to denote the objects of those acts, the things that are perceived or thought of. An idea in the sense of an "act or process of thinking" is obviously incapable of existing apart from a thinker, but an idea in the second sense as the "thing thought of" is in no way dependent on the thinker, being in many cases an object or event that antedates the existence of him who thinks it. To overlook the equi- vocation and to argue from the dependence of 'ideas' as processes of thought to the dependence of 'ideas' as objects of thought is the surest and quickest way to get the idealistic paradox. The second cause for the failure of the idealist to accept the evidences of realism is based upon a misinterpretation of the relativity of knowledge. The idealist notes that 'which objects' are known varies with and depends</page><page sequence="12">200 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXI. upon the condition of the knower, and argues from this that 'the objects' that are known depend upon the knower. To clear up this difficulty it is only necessary to remind ourselves that it is certainly true that 'which objects' are pointed at depends upon our pointing; but that this does not mean that 'the objects' that we point at depend upon our pointing. If consciousness is conceived as the power or capacity of the effects produced in the brain to point to or imply the objects which are their actual possible causes, then we shall be able to reconcile the 'relativity of knowledge' with the independent existence of the objects known. For consciousness con- ceived as the self-transcending implications of the brain-states will be indubitably selective of its contents without being in any sense constitutive of them. D. S. MILLER. I. It conduces to a better understanding to those engaged in the discussion to agree in giving up certain traditional positions and arguments that may be given up. The following are well-known positions or arguments of idealism that must be dismissed: (a) That the world as it is to any individual is just his world-vision or world-conception, or the vision or conception of a pure ego. This as an argument bearing on the subject of our discussion must be rejected. If true it would have no bearing on the question of the sense in which unperceived real objects exist or their relation to the perceived objects. (b) It cannot be said that everything we know is known as expe- rienced, and thus that nothing but what is experienced is thinkable by us. Experienced thing has no content or meaning beyond the word 'thing'unless it is contrasted with an opposite which is equally thinkable. This is in fact the case. (c) When it is said that the subject-object relation is universal the arguments used to prove this are without foundation. (d) When it is assumed that, if the color and other qualities of an object are content of consciousness and we perceive them they cannot be withdrawn from consciousness and continue to exist unchanged, a baseless principle is assumed. This principle was assumed by Berkeley and refuted by Hume. II. The doctrine that neo-realism in the main defends or with which neo-realism desires to connect itself as much as may be is pre- sentative, immediate or so-called naive realism. (It is not real naive realism which is in fact a latent idealism.) But this species of pre- sentative realism breaks down for three amongst other reasons, and much of its plausibility disappears for a fourth reason:</page><page sequence="13">No. 2.] AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION. 201 (a) The time taken in perception proves that the perceived object is not identical with the real object. (b) The fact of illusion proves that the perceived object is not identical with the real object. (c) The theory would oblige us to hold that when two people side by side look at the same object much of the object is actually present in their two fields of consciousness at once. This involves a contra- diction in terms. (d) An object cannot become a content of consciousness as an object, that is, its objectivity cannot be given in its presence as a content of perception. Objectivity is by its very nature a matter of properties in the object that cannot all be revealed in one instant nor even in a minute span of time. Objectivity means a potentiality of certain further manifestations. A perception is an impression plus a readiness to behave in a certain fashion. Thus an object cannot as such be a given or "perceived object." A. 0. LoVEJOY. Four principal episodes may be distinguished in the process whereby the content of man's experience has come to be divided by thought into two classes of existence-the class of things conceived to have objective physical existence and the class of things conceived to have 'subjective' or 'mental' or 'psychic' existence only. The notion of subjective existence (which is not identical with the notion of a subject or self) seems when clarified, to signify a mode or medium of sub- sistence in which things or qualities may be existentially present merely as 'presentations,' as data in a given moment's perceptual or other experience of an individual percipient, without necessarily having any corresponding existence outside of that experience, in any other context, at any other moment, or in any 'real space.' The four chief stages in the development of this notion and in the gradual extension of its denotation consist, then, in the following (real or supposed) discoveries: (i) The discovery of the subjectivity of conations and (probably) pleasure-pain feelings. (2) The discovery of the sub- jectivity of hallucinations, illusions and dreams. (3) The discovery of the subjectivity of secondary qualities of matter. (4) The dis- covery of the subjectivity of all sensible qualities (subjective idealism). The historic significance of the new realism is that, more radical than most earlier realisms, it rejects not only the fourth of these discoveries, but also the third, and (in the more thorough and consistent forms of the doctrine) the second, and minimizes even the first, by calling conations mental or organic processes, in distinction from 'mental content,' which latter is held to be non-existent.</page><page sequence="14">202 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXI. This paper is concerned solely with the question of the validity of the second discovery. While all typical new realists agree in denying that the objects and qualities presented in hallucination or illusory perception are 'subjective existences' merely, they differ as to whether those objects are 'real' or 'unreal' (in the sense suggested by the committee). Nunn, and apparently Alexander and other English realists, declare that, e. g., the "straight staff bent in a pool" does not " merely seem to be bent," but that it really "is bent." This view, which may be called absolute objectivism, appears to the writer the consistent one for this school to take. For the essence of the new realism is its conception of consciousness as an external and non- constitutive relation. But this conception implies that all objects and qualities actually in consciousness are, in a univocal sense, real things in a real relation. But this consequence of the new realism requires us to assert contradictory predicates of the same object: to say that, e. g., the staff in the pool is at once both straight and not- straight. Unless absolute objectivism can give us a new theory of the logical relation of sensible 'attributes' to the objects possessing them, this seems a fatal objection to that doctrine, and therefore to the relational theory of consciousness, and therefore to the new realism (i. e., the combination of realism with epistemological monism). Certain other contemporary realists e. g., Montague and McGil- vary-recognizing these difficulties in absolute objectivism, seek by various ingenious assumptions and distinctions to conceive of illusory and hallucinatory data as 'real,' without thereby abandoning epistemo- logical monism. Detailed criticism of these devices may await the fuller presentation of them; but in general it may be contended that they fail to deliver their authors from dualism and from an admission of the subjective existence of the illusory-in the sense of 'subjective existence' herein defined. FRANK THILLY. Reflection upon such experiences as differences in what is taken to be the same object, mistakes, dreams, illusions, and hallucinations, has suggested the inference that the real objects are not always given in particular actual perceptions exactly as they are. Natural science seems to confirm this conclusion: the scientific conception of the uni- verse does not agree with the naive perception of the universe.

The answer to the question of consciousness as a factor in the per- ceptual situation which is given by radical realists follows necessarily from their naive dogmatism: if the object perceived is the object unperceived, numerically identical with it, then there is no difference between the status of an object in a stream of perceptions and its status out of it. But, here again, the biological theories of these thinkers suggest conclusions inconsistent with their radical premises. Physically and physiologically speaking, perception is the entire organism in interaction or relation with its environment; we cannot single out any one particular element in the situation and call that the physical or physiological counterpart of the process of perception. No more can we, in speaking of perception as a mental event, abstract the so-called perceived object from the functions involved, in the hope that we may in this way get at the core of being, or discover the object exactly as it would be apart from any perceiver. We may say that in the perceptual situation an object is revealed, made manifest, but we must also say that much that appears belongs to the mental realm, is read into the object, sometimes truly, sometimes not. This does not mean that the mind alters the real object or that it creates an object out of nothing or that the object creates a picture of itself in the mind or that the object lies imbedded in the mind. All we can say is that a conscious organism perceives a real object in a certain way, according to the mental and physical factors involved. EVANDER BRADLEY MCGILVARY. i. The relational view of consciousness is compatible with the recognition that the same real object is in different consciousnesses. 2. (a) A real object may be a many-in-one with as much logical right as is conceded to any 'single field of experience.' (b) Continuity of perceived surface may be conceived by 'natural' realism as unreal, when the real surface is discontinuous; but such a conception is not necessitated until further analysis of the conception of continuity be made. 3. An hallucinatory object occupies real space, but does not monop- olize it. In other words impenetrability is not a universal character- istic of space-occupying things. 4. When we now see a star which became extinct a thousand years ago, our consciousness spans the thousand years, just as when we see</page><page sequence="16">204 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. lVOL. XXI. an object a mile away our consciousness spans the mile. But while spanning time and space, any consciousness is centered in a definite time and place, the time and place of the body. Consciousness has a limited eternity and ubiquity, but its ubiquity and eternity radiate from the here and now. 5. Color-blindness is explicable on the relational theory of conscious- ness; it may be due to the fact that the real brightness of a real object is selected to be a term of a consciousness relation, while the color of the real object is left out of the consciousness complex. 6. 'Consciousness of consciousness' is a misnomer for an actual fact. The fact is the occasional attentional prominence of conscious- ness over its objects, a prominence of just the same kind as is enjoyed by any object of consciousness over some other object when we say that it is the object of attention. An object of attention need not be an object of consciousness; it may be consciousness itself. HENRY RUTGERS MARSHALL. The ordinary man makes a natural distinction between the natural order and the mental order. For him the word consciousness means the sum total of all that exists in this mental order. It is thus that the writer uses the word consciousness. In making this distinction between the natural and mental orders the ordinary man naively accepts a radical dualism. But, in many cases of what we call the appreciation of illusion, certain items in the natural order (objects in the outer world), as the result of quite indirect thought processes quite within the mental order, become images in the mental order; and this by the loss of an 'out-thereness' characteristic; which 'out-thereness' itself appears to be a mental order character- istic. This, and much else, indicates that the natural order is a special part of the mental order; a part which has this 'out-thereness' characteristic which the rest of the mental order has not. Such a view may be called introspective monism. The writer suggests that some at least of our metaphysical prob- lems may find their solution if they are stated in terms compatible with such a view as to the nature of the natural order. But it does not appear clear to him that any definite position in relation to the questions at issue between realism and idealism can be held to be taken by one who thus merely suggests a special mode of statement of these questions. The writer is therefore not convinced that his view implies epistemological monism and idealism, as is stated in the Committee's printed report. If, however, such can be shown to be the case, epistemological monism and idealism must, in his view, be accepted.</page><page sequence="17">No. 2.j AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION. 205 The Meaning of the Term Evolution. G. R. MONTGOMERY. There are two distinct pictures which the term evolution is being used to symbolize: that of a sort of continuum which asserts the forms of life to be universally connected, without breaks, or gaps, or vacu- ums, so that when we have before us all the links there is no call for something out of the ordinary to lead up to the more widely divergent types; the other use, the older and more metaphysical one, asserts that in some way the present is an unfolding of the past, the new is rolled out of what has been. The tendency of many recent writers is to limit the meaning of evo- lution to the former of these two pictures and to ask those to employ a different term, say preformationism, who have use for the idea that the new is unfolded out of the past. This tendency seems to be the exact opposite of the best policy; because many who think the new to be contained in the old, still would repudiate preformationism; moreover the term evolution is so definitely a picture of evolving, unfolding, that it would be impossible to keep out the idea of an unwrapping and to visualize merely a continuity of existence; again the term evolution is too snugly intermeshed with the category of cause-effect to serve as a symbol of mere continuity where the prece- dent has no influence upon the consequent, but allows us merely to anticipate the consequent; and finally the idea of mere continuity is important enough to warrant a new picture with a new symbol or term. The meaning of the term evolution will become clearer if by way of contrast another picture is suggested indicating the signification to symbolize which these recent writers are using the term. A picture which fairly well represents their position is that of a fabric, say a magic carpet that is in the process of weaving. We do not say of being woven, for in the picture there would be no loom and no weaver; but existence may be illuminatingly visualized as a woven fabric that lies stretching out indefinitely in one direction and in the other terminating, though always growing, at an edge which makes up the changing-present. At this edge the threads mysteriously interweave and mysteriously increase in length. Such a textilic or fabrication theory of existence involves no cause- effect category. Those who visualize life thus would say merely that certain patterns are followed regularly by certain other patterns and certain events enable us to anticipate certain other events. A weaving web theory of life, like this, is distinct from evolution, and is to be seriously urged as a corrective of the idea that development is an unfolding of what is latently contained.</page><page sequence="18">206 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXI. The Progress of Evolution. A. C. ARMSTRONG. In this paper the progress of evolution is considered from the point of view of noetics, with incidental references to the history of opinion concerning evolution and the epistemological questions which it involves: I. Progress has been imperfect in regard to the origins of evolution. Darwinism has been held the primary, or even the sole source of the doctrine; whereas other forces were earlier at work, in some instances with important results. 2. Nevertheless, Darwinism precipitated the crisis of the mid-I9th century. At first scientific evolution and transcendent evolution *ere not distinguished. Here great progress has been achieved, to the benefit of both types of thought. 3. Evolution and the sciences; in particular the logic or methodol- ogy of science. Evolution profoundly influenced the Geisteswissen- schaften as well as the sciences of physical fact. Progress has been made in respect of the problems raised by the transfer of methods and principles from biology to the sciences of the mental group, but it may be doubted whether the progress is complete. 4. The presuppositions of evolution. Evolution unquestionably implies noetical presuppositions. The concepts of genesis, nature, worth. Overlooked fifty years ago, these were forced on the notice of reflective thinkers by the exigencies of the discussion. In the consideration and elucidation of them there has been mingled advance and retreat. In sum, it can hardly be maintained that the progress made is adequate. But this conclusion does not imply agreement with interpretative essays of a venturesome type. Early Evolution in America. I. WOODBRIDGE RILEY. The three centuries of American thought present three phases of Pre-Darwinian evolution. To use the Comtean formula: in the seven- teenth century the interest was theological; evolution-if such it may be called-was an unfolding of the divine plan according to the mere good pleasure of the Most High; in the eighteenth the interest was metaphysical: the divine plan became rationalized, evidences of design were diligently sought after, man's task was to discover God's ways of working in the world; in the nineteenth the interest became positive: only after theology and teleology had been left behind was it possible to fasten attention on evolution in the stricter modern sense of epi- genesis, of the origin of species, of the descent of man. In brief, the history of evolution in America, as in Europe, has been from the cosmic to the organic, has passed through the logical phases from supernatural election to natural selection.</page><page sequence="19">No. 2.] AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION. 207 The scheme of supernaturalism, derived largely from the Mosaic or Miltonic cosmogony, had three factors which were in turn opposed by three tenets of naturalism. Against special creation there was spontaneous generation; against permanence of species mutability, against cataclysmic destruction degradation through disuse. Spon- taneous generation hindered rather than helped the cause. Upheld by the followers of Erasmus Darwin, opposed by Priestley and Cooper, accepted by Clark of Harvard but finally abandoned as untenable, recourse was had to the plurality of origins by Morton of Philadelphia and Nott of Mobile. Modified mutability was fostered by Wells of Charleston and Leidy of Philadelphia, although the permanence of species continued to be defended by Agassiz. Degradation through disuse was promulgated by Stanhope Smith of Princeton, but it was left to the geologists, rather than the Lamarckian zoologists, to dis- prove cataclysmic destruction. Now follow the geological, morphological, and embryological argu- ments for transformism. These were opposed by Hitchcock the pre- formationist and expounded by Asa Gray the protagonist of natural selection in America. After the publication of the Origin of Species the contestants over naturalism divide into opponents from Joseph Cook to Howison, and into adherents, from the lukewarm like Chauncy Wright and President McCosh, to the ardent like Edward Cope and John Fiske. Mechanism and Causality in the Light of Recent Physics. M. R. COHEN. The mechanical conception of nature, while frequently developed in the interest of physical monism, has been largely fashioned by idealistic philosophers (Descartes, Leibniz, Kant, etc.). It is generally supposed to be logically necessary for the physical realm. This supposed necessity is based on a number of misconceptions, more particularly (i) on a confusion between the mechanical and the physical, and (2) on the confusion between mechanism and deter- minism. The classic science of mechanics (i. e., the science of the motions of material bodies) is a deductive system of propositions all deducible from Newton's three Laws of Motion and D'Alembert's Principle. No valid a priori reason can be adduced why all physical phenomena should be deducible from these laws. The actual historical attempt to do this has resulted in the introduction of a number of additional hypotheses as to the occult properties of matter which are comparable to the epicycles of the Ptolemaic astronomy.</page><page sequence="20">2o8 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXI. While physicists have for a long time been chafing under this in- creasing load of hypotheses (cf. Rankine's paper on Energetics, i855), it is only the progress of experimental physics within the last two decades that has freed physics from the absolute sway of purely mechanical concepts: (I) The study of cathode rays and kindred phenomena has shown that Newton's laws of motion are valid only within definite limits, and that the traditional mechanics is not true for very large velocities nor for very small particles. (2) The mass of material particles has been shown to be probably of electrical origin so that mechanics must now be based on electricity rather than electricity on mechanics. As a result, therefore, of recent-progress in physics, the old mechan- ical view is giving way to what might be called the statistical view of nature. From this point of view the classic concept of absolutely uniform laws of nature becomes replaced by the statistical concept of correlation, and the notion of efficient causality by that of functional relation (in the mathematical sense). The traditional conception of physical causality is undoubtedly of anthropomorphic origin, and too indeterminate for a scientific physics. Its chief use has been the esthetic or pedagogic one of vivifying our descriptions of inanimate nature. Implication and Existence. CHRISTINE LADD FRANKLIN. Modern logic has done a great service in inculcating, by precept and example, fresh habits of exact and clear thinking. But it has introduced (in the hands of Bertrand Russell) many vagaries which the philosopher who reads the awe-inspiring first chapter of his book will do well not to take too seriously. Thus to set up 'p implies q' as the type of the logic process, and to regard it as possessing some cabalistic significance-as capable of throwing light upon problems- is an error in itself, and leads to error on the part of those who make use of the conception. The actual number of primary logic-relations between propositions (or terms)-that is, relations in is- implies- is eight; for the logician, it is fatal to ignore seven of them. (a) Four of them are particular; in discussion, an opponent denies the validity of certain pretended logic-relations, the denial of a universal relation is a particular relation, hence to omit particular relations is to limit logic unjustifiably. (b) Four of these relations are symmetrical; in the symmetrical relations the logical distinction between antecedent and consequent has disappeared, transposition from one member to the other of the relation takes place with the utmost simplicity, the</page><page sequence="21">No. 2.] AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION. 209 danger of Wrong Conversion (the one danger that lies in wait for those who reason) is absolutely eliminated. Syllogism becomes the "In- consistent Triad" (or the Antilogism), with one rule for all the modes and figures. Surely these good, symmetrical, forms of statement should not be ignored without consideration. (c) The main char- acteristic of reasoning is that it consists in putting This and That together, in eliminating unnecessary information, in evolving con- clusions out of premises which did not seem to contain them. The type-form usually given for this process is PlP2 &lt;- C, "the premises entail the conclusion." We have, indeed, a single premise in the case of the "immediate inference," but that is a minor part of logic. The reason which Bertrand Russell gives for representing the premises as one is that the relation looks more symmetrical in this way. But surely the appearance of symmetry where no symmetry is, is dangerous in the extreme. In this case, it has actually led to error,-to the error of supposing that p and-q play like roles in the relation, and that when, for example, an hypothesis p has been shown to be a sufficient explanation of an actual state of things q, its truth is assured. This is the case only if it has been shown to be an 'indispensable' explanation, -a condition sine qua non,-which is a very different relation. (d) In every statement, whether simple or compound (i. e., whether about terms or about propositions), there is always involved implicitly if not explicitly, an existence-term (truth-term, reality-term). Thus we have, as exactly equivalent to 'p implies q' 'c implies non-p or q,' or, ' what is possible is either non-p or else q.' There are many reasons for preferring, as the type-form of the logic-relation, one of those in which the existence-term (truth-term, reality-term) is explicit. This term has many interesting characteristics. In it is made explicit the suppressed universe of discourse (domain of thought, range of significance) of the logician. In conclusion it should be observed that Frege, Peano, and Bertrand Russell are writing on mathematics, and that they give a very garbled account of a non-special symbolic logic. Chance. W. H. SHELDON. The object is to show that chance is just as real as causation, space, quantity or other accredited scientific categories. Chance is at the outset taken to mean lack of causation for a perfect knowledge; but a fuller and positive definition will later appear. Many writers admit it in some sense, but few, if any, as an objective category, real in the sense in which the law of gravitation is real. Such reality</page><page sequence="22">2IO THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXI. I shall claim for it. And I study not the mathematical but the empirical concept: not, what would chance mean in an ideal system of knowledge, but, what of the fortuitous is implied in present-day scientific methods and results? Chance in the sense of the indepen- dence between simultaneous causal series (Cournot, Palmer and others) seems hard to prove: I shall not study it. We consider rather chance within a series: events apparently not caused by anything past or present. These seem to be furnished us by the science of statistics. Variations about a type, which when plotted conform approximately to the probability-curve, are verified in many regions. And the probability-curve is just what would result, provided all possible events in a given field occurred an equal number of times. We must now show, (I) that this can be explained only by the assumption, in addition to the recognized causal agencies at work, of a tendency in events to deviate with equal frequency in all direc- tions from the exact resultant of those agencies, (2) that this devia- tion, while collectively law-abiding, is of such a nature as to imply chance in the individual case. I. The hypothesis of universal causation, determining each indi- vidual variation strictly as the effect of its special environment past and present, will not guarantee that the variations will be of equal frequency in all directions (approximately). To account for that, a special tendency so to vary must be begged. 2. This tendency implies chance in the individual deviations. For if they are determined by anything whatever besides the tendency itself, there is no guarantee that the tendency will be fulfilled. But it is fulfilled. And they cannot be determined by the tendency itself. For, it is indifferent to the order and particular appearance of each variation; therefore they cannot be determined beforehand at all, and are matters of chance. We find then in Nature "a tendency to vary with equal frequency in all possible directions; the variation implying law for the group, chance for the individual members." Chance has thus a positive aspect-variation, spreading about a type-as well as a negative. It is a dual affair. The Nature and Function of Definition in a Deductive System. KARL SCHMIDT. The modern account admits only 'nominal' as opposed to 'real' definitions. The essential parts of this theory may be briefly stated as follows:</page><page sequence="23">No. 2.] AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION. 21I i. A definition merely imposes a name upon things (Pascal); this- is stated either in the form that a definition is an equation (Sigwart, Peano, et al.); or, more consistently, by declaring that the equation sign in a definition is to be taken together with the sign 'Df' as standing for 'means' (Whitehead-Russel, in Principia Mathe- matica). 2. There is a radical distinction between propositions and defini- tions: the former are always either true or false [or "meaningless," Whitehead-Russell], the latter are neither (Russell, Couturat, et al.). 3. Definitions have no essential function in a deductive system: they are mere typographical conveniences which could be dispensed with (Peano, Russell, et al.). This account makes several acknowledged procedures in a deductive system 'paradoxical': i. If a definition merely imposes a name, why is it usually so diffi- cult to make a good definition? 2. How is it possible that " they often convey more important infor- mation than is contained in the propositions in which they are used?" (Principia Mathematica.) 3. Why are 'existence proofs' necessary? 4. How is it possible that 'definitions' and 'theorems' may be interchanged? 5. There are definitions possible and admitted which are not in the form of an "equation"; the "postulate definitions" are among them; the arguments advanced against them (Couturat) are not valid. 6. The (alleged) distinctions between definitions and postulates (Frege, Couturat) are not valid. This (now almost universally accepted) account confuses a definition with an explanation, in taking an accidental property of many definitions as the defining property of all definitions: many definitions can be put into the form of an equation x = f(a, b, c, ***). It is not necessary to investigate here whether every definition can be put into this form (the above account makes even this problem impossible): even if a definition is given in the form of an equation it is neither the 'x' (the 'name'), nor the " equation " which constitutes the definition, but the "f," i. e., the new relation between elements ('un- defined,' or previously defined) of the system, by which a (new) logical entity is uniquely determined. It is this 'uniquely determining' which is the defining property of definition in a deductive system. Put differently: a definition is a system of conditions which is satisfied by</page><page sequence="24">212 THE PHILOSQPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXI. only one class of logical entities in a given system; this class is said to be 'defined' by the system of conditions; whether this latter is 'solved' with respect to x or not is unessential. A definition in a deductive system need not be exhaustive in the sense that all properties of the " defined " logical entity are stated; but it must be "complete," i. e., all the properties of the defined logical entity must be deducible from it, provided the 'other' propositions (including the " postulates ") of the system hold; but not otherwise. A definition is therefore an integral part of a given system. If the defined logical entity is conceived as a system of properties, symbolized by 'x,' then nc = f(a, b, c, * may be conceived as an equivalence valid in the given system, but not otherwise. Definitions are indispensable in a deductive system: they are one of the accepted methods of introducing into a deductive system the 'New,' which seems to have given mathematicians so much concern of late. The possibility of defining every logical entity of a system in terms of a few indefinables, which the Principia Mathematica have thus far carried through so successfully, does not establish the contention that nothing 'New' enters the system: it hides the 'New' behind the typographical configuration which must be considered an essential (though somewhat neglected) part of the symbolism of the Principia Mathematica.
