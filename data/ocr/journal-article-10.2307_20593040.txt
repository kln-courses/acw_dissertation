PROLOGUE: YOU As though explaining the idea of dancing Or the idea of some other thing Which everyone has known a little about Since they were children, which children learn themselves With no explaining, but which children like Sometimes to hear the explanations of, I want to tell you something about our country, Or my idea of it: explaining it If not to you, to my idea of you. I25</page><page sequence="2">POETRY Dancing is the expression by the body Of how the soul and brain respond to music And yes, not only to the sensual, God-like, Varying repetitions which we love But also, I admit it, to harmony, too: As of a group. But what the Brownies did Gathered inside a church the other day (Except for one flushed Leader, smiling and skipping With shoes off through the dance) was Close Drill: frowning, The children shuffled anxiously at command Through the home-stitched formations of the Square Dance. Chewing your nails, you couldn't get it straight. Another Leader, with her face exalted By something like a passion after order, Was roughly steering by the shoulders, each In turn, two victims: brilliant, incompetent you; And a tight, humiliated blonde, her daughter. But before going on about groups, leaders, Churches and such, I think I want to try To explain you. Countries and people of course Cannot be known or told in final terms ... But can be, in the comic, halting way Of parents, explained: as Death and Government are. I don't mean merely to pretend to write To you, yet don't mean either to pretend To say only what you might want to hear. I mean to write to my idea of you, And not expecting you to read a word ... Though you are better at understanding words Than most people I know. You understand An Old Man's Winter Night. And I believe, Compulsive explainer that I am, and you Being who you are, that if I felt the need To make some smart, professor-ish crack about Walt Whitman, the Internment Camps, or Playboy I could, if necessary, explain it to you,</page><page sequence="3">ROBERT PINSKY Who, writing under the name of "Karen Owens," Began your "Essay On Kids": "In my opinion, We 'tots' are truly in the 'prime of life', Of all creatures on earth, or other planets Should there be life on such." In games and plays, You like to be the Bad Guy, Clown or Dragon, Not Mother or The Princess. Your favorite creature Is the Owl, the topic of another "Essay." Garrulous, prosy, good at spelling and fond Of punctuation, you cannot form two letters Alike or on a line. You suck your thumb And have other infantile traits, although A student interviewing "tots" from five To eight for her psychology project found, Scaling results, that your ideas of God And of your dreams were those of an adult. Though I should never tell you that (or this) It occurs to me, thinking of Chaplin, Twain And others-thinking of owls, the sacred bird Of Athens and Athene-that it is not A type (the solitary flights at night; The dreams mature, the spirit infantile) Which America has always known to prize. -Not that I mean to class you with the great At your age, but that the celebrated examples (Ted Williams comes to mind) recall your face, The soft long lashes behind the owlish glasses Which you selected over "cuter" frames: That softness-feathery, protective, inward Muffling the quickness of the raptor's eye, The gaze of liberty and independence Uneasy in groups and making groups uneasy.

MYSTERIES OF THE FUTURE People stream slowly from a city church, Their clothes bright in the sudden winter daylight, Their bodies clean and warm inside the cloth Like flags and armor in the dazzling air, Sun flashing and wincing from the curbside ice. Their pace is dreamy, strolling to their cars Over the gritty sidewalk, in Sunday clothes. It is Chicago; and though in many ways It could be some place in another country, The way I see the people and the church As mysteries, not just unknown or foreign Makes it this country: and Chicago, a setting We make as we discover. It makes me think Of how small children, with laborious And grubby fingers, improvise a scene From disproportionate, inspired arrangements Of toys and objects: mirror for a pond, And gathered on the shore amid strange buildings, In mad, pedantic order, animals And people. The squirrel, immense, bears on his shoulders Riders including an anthropomorphic lion, In pants and glasses. Barnyard and jungle creatures Have landed their airplane-some are on the wings Right on the hotel roof Wagons and cars Parade down to the water.... The girls and women In pretty colors, the males in blue or brown, Pause eddying on the steps, as though to blink Like science-fiction travelers through time, Uncertain if the surfaces they see So brazenly gleaming mean to hail them toward The mysteries of the past, or of the future. 128</page><page sequence="5">ROBERT PINSKY Whether they have slept in church or not, they look Refreshed in spirit, ready for the cuisine And music of this era ahead or back, Younger or older than the one they knew. "For here we have no continuing city, but seek For one to come"-Hebrews, I3:I4. I can't say if our country is old, or young. The future is an electrocuting thought That stuns the thinking reed to quiet, and heightens The sense that everything we make is mortal, Or part of some continuing epitaph. Our very sentences are like a cloth Cut shimmering from conventions of the dead Hung sometimes to flutter from a spar or gallant, Nudged forward like the paper boats of candy Launched for the gods downriver, in the future. If I could sail forward to see the streets Of that strange country where you will live past me, Or further even by a hundred years; And walk those pavements with my phantom steps, And find Chicago flashing in winter sun; And church doors ready to swing open, or melt Before my penetrating ghost-my courage Would fail, I think: best not to mount the steps Where I could leave no footprint in the snow ... Best not to see those garments. The shining casket, Pure gold, where Philip of Macedonia lay Twenty-three hundred years, and his breastplate And greaves of gold and ivory, are gorgeous still; But all the treasury of woven fabrics And splendid leather that lay around the king Technicians using instruments can deduce Only from the fine dust scattered on the floor Around the casket; the long hardwood handle Of his bright spear fell slowly to a powder I29</page><page sequence="6">POETRY Where it was propped, and left the point adhering Eerily to the stonework of the wall. It's fearful to leave anything behind, To choose or make some one thing to survive Into the future-where the air and light That spread around us here in all directions Stand ready to dim, discolor, and unravel The colors that we fit around our bodies, Precious and mutable, a second skin. (Although the soul may be immortal, or not And some believe that even the body may rise Our cloth must die, and parch away forever.) Jefferson in his epitaph records That he was author of the Declaration Of Independence, and of the Virginia law Providing public education; and founder Of that state's University-omitting His "high office" . . . as if it were a bound, Or something held, not something he had done The ceremonial garment he had been given By others, with a certain solemn function And honor; eventually, to be removed. The church, Gothic Revival, and waiting cars With brightwork glinting through a haze of salt Suggest Nostalgia and Progress-which are in spirit Less blatant, intimate, tragic than Epitaph: As though the people, blood rising to their cheeks As they walk into the cold, could leave behind The image of themselves in their good clothes To survive as a memorial, compacted By twenty centuries of the slowest fire As if to something made of stone, or metal. In the familiar boast or accusation Americans have scant "historic sense"; I30</page><page sequence="7">ROBERT PINSKY Nostalgia and Progress seem to be our frail National gestures against the enveloping, Suffiusive nightmare of time-which swallows first The unaware, because they are least free ... But time's nightmare, and freedom from it, differ For different peoples: like their burial customs; And what they choose to say in what they leave. To speak words few enough to fit a stone, And frame them as if speaking from the past Into the void or mystery of the future, Demands that we be naked, free, and final: God wills us free, man wills us slaves. I will as God wills Gods will be done. Here lies the body of JOHNJACK A native of Africa who died MARCH 1773 aged about 6o years Tho' born in a land ofslavery, He was bornfree, Tho' he lived in a land of liberty, He lived a slave, Till by his honest, tho' stolen labors, He acquired the source ofslavery, Which gave him his freedom, Tho' not long before Death the Grand Tyrant Gave him his final emancipation, And set him on a footing with kings. Tho' a slave to vice, He practiced those virtues Without which kings are but slaves. I3'</page></plain_text>
