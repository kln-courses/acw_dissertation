The expression theory of art continues to be the focus of considerable attention in philosophi- cal circles despite the barrage of criticism that has been leveled against it by philosophers rep- resenting various strains of analytic philosophy. The effect of that criticism has been the elimi- nation of much of the misleading language and unnecessary complexity which accompanied early versions of the expression theory; but the resultant version is one that, as Professor Sircello asserts, "can say no more than that art works have properties designated by the same words which designate feelings, emotions, attitudes, moods, and personal characteristics of human beings" (p. 17). Because of the wide acceptance of this view of expression in art, which he identifies primarily with 0. K. Bouwsma and Monroe Beardsley, Professor Sircello refers to it as the Canonical Position. The primary objective of Mind and Art, then, is to carry the expression theory beyond the Canonical Position. In the effort to achieve that end, Professor Sircello also provides an analysis of the varieties of expres- sion, suggests a role for the concept of expres- sion in the philosophy of mind, and considers briefly the concept of self-expression. A central concept in the development of Sircello's position is that of "artistic acts," i.e., what the artist does in his work. For example, an artist may treat his subject matter sentimentally, paint a picture in an aloof way, or compassion- ately portray the hero of his story. What the artist does in each of these cases cannot be de- scribed independently of the work itself. There is no way to know whether the hero has been portrayed compassionately except to look at the hero. What Sircello means by "artistic acts" are dclearly distinguished from other activities in which the artist might be engaged, e.g., chiseling marble, typing a manuscript, applying paint to a canvas, evaluating his progress, and so on. Ar- tistic acts, however, "are not entirely alone in the universe." They are quite like such acts as scowling angrily, smiling sadly, or gesturing im- patiently. No one can be said to be scowling angrily without the evidence of the angry scowl. It is because of their artistic acts and the simi- larity of artistic acts to "common facial, vocal, and gestural expressions" that "works of art may serve as expressions of those feelings, emotions, attitudes, moods, and/or personal characteristics of their creators which are designated by the anthropomorphic predicates applicable to the art works themselves" (p. 35). The concept of artistic acts is considerably broader than those acts to which we can attrib- ute anthropomorphic predicates. Included are what Sircello calls "subjective factors," a di- verse set of phenomena which are found in lengthy passages of critical dialogue about works of art, and which are not reducible to individual anthropomorphic predicates applicable to works of art. Such factors as "love of nature, awareness of manners, nobility of soul, and Satanic per- sonalities" are integrally related to works of art, but they are not related in just the way that sadness and anger are. Artistic acts do not re- quire anthropomorphic qualification, but those acts which are not so qualified may be part of a larger scheme that allows works of art including such acts to be as expressive as works that include anthropomorphically qualified acts. It has been the failure of the Canonical Position to ignore the expressiveness in art that follows from the inclusion of artistic acts. Several chapters of this work are devoted to discussing the concept of expressiveness de- veloped in virtue of artistic acts as it appears in different contexts. Sircello considers, for ex- ample, the relation of expression to language, the objective world, ideas, signs, causation, and showing. From his analysis of showing and ex- pressing Sircello turns to the implications of his position for the philosophy of mind. In seeking a unifying principle for all of the expressions of F (where F is a variable ranging over anything that may be properly spoken of as expressible) Sircello rejects "intentional explanations" which focus upon the organizing or interpretive capaci-</page><page sequence="2">276 ties of the mind. Instead, he proposes the possi- bility that F is the formal cause-a case sui generis-of all of its expressions. As Sircello states, "A fundamental 'realism' with respect to the unity among F's expressions is thereby forced upon us. Acts G, H, and I show F, if they are expressions of F, not because 'we' see them as showing F, but because F caused them to be such as to show F" (p. 270). It is this concept of causation, developed in terms of showing and expressing, that supports a Romantic concept of mind wherein mind is considered an original source, in the sense of being both unique and primary. Sircello's argument is that this concept of mind is strongly suggested by his analysis of expression and the concept of formal causation which is developed from that analysis. With regard to the related concept of self, Sircello contends that what is expressed, if it is to count as self-expression, must be of considera- ble magnitude. That is, one can self-express an "utter indomitability of spirit," but not "a respectful attitude towards the people who live two doors down" (p. 305). Self-expression also must include an element of nobility. Mean emotions and attitudes, regardless of their mag- nitude cannot be an expression of the self be- cause they tend to destroy rather than expand the self. " 'Self-expression' is thus an intrinsically normative concept" (p. 307). What counts as self-expression also must be a fundamental aspect of a person. The existence of a self de- pends upon the expression of that self, and when one expresses himself, he is seeking to discover his own fundamental nature. Sircello concludes by examining fourteen kinds of activity, ranging from artistic to custodial, to determine the pros- pects for self-expression in each. Mind and Art is a remarkably fertile book. Sircello has introduced a number of ideas which should serve as the guideposts for further philo- sophical reflection. His attack on the Canonical Position is one of several that have been mounted of late. The merits of the expression theory are far too numerous for that theory to be relegated to the level of insignificance of the Canonical Position. What is called for now is an account of the relation of Sircello's position to other efforts to go beyond the Canonical Posi- tion, especially those that rely upon some con- cept of embodiment. The concept of self-ex- pression developed by Sircello also requires further analysis, particularly in relation to art. Self-expression may have broader implications for the appreciation of art than even Professor Sircello envisions at the moment. The concept of mind suggested by Sircello's account of expres- R E V I E W S sion is an intriguing one, and it is likely to attract considerable attention from those who are inclined to accept some version of a Ro- mantic concept of mind. It is always difficult to present the ideas and arguments of an author in the brief space of a review, but it is especially difficult in this case. It is incumbent upon the reader, therefore, to see whether Professor Sir- cello has answered adequately in the text all of the questions raised by this brief account of his theory. WILLIAM L. BLIZEK University of Nebraska, Omaha FEIBLEMAN, JAMES K. The Quiet Rebellion. N.Y.: Horizon Press, 1972, 240 pp., $7.95. Of the fourteen essays here usefully bound to- gether, ten appeared earlier (1962-71) in jour- nals. Some central theorems of Feibleman's aes- thetic pervade this collection. (1) Artistic imagin- ing is controlled imagining: "that deliberate exercise in which elements disclosed to experi- ence are broken up and reassembled..." (p. 17). Unicorns are new wholes made of old parts. (2) Such imagining assumes that all things are affectively related. The more disparate the sub- stantives whose qualitative connection is dis- closed, the more effective the device. Alice and the reader are both required to get well used to queer things happening. (3) The ultimate refer- ence of art "is the value of the unity of the world as concentrated in the quality of its symbolic counterpart" (p. 170). 'We are authentic parts of the world if all things are, and this is com- forting" (p. 23). (4) Beauty is "the radiant quality which emerges from the perfect relations of parts in a whole" (p. 195). Rembrandt's com- monplace themes are thus suffused with what Longinus called sublimity. Concentrated in Chapters 9 and 10 is what we may call a semiotic; art works are here cate- gorized as carriers of meaning and reference. (See Monroe C. Beardsley, "Semiotic Aesthetics and Aesthetic Education," Philosophic Exchange, Summer 1973, pp. 155-71.) Plainly Feibleman stands apart from the iconic signification theory rooted in Peirce and developed in Morris and Langer; for Feibleman the unicorn as a new image "was completely available for covering with affects by imagining them. It had no tradi- tional associations and so fresh ones could be assigned to it through context" (p. 21). Feible- man's own semiotic claims that "any consistent set of contrary-to-fact conditionals is a work of art" (p. 168). He distinguishes the work's mean-</page></plain_text>
