In spite of Samuel Beckett's supposed atheism or nihilism, as the century wanes</page><page sequence="2">224 Book Reviews more critics and scholars appear to be wondering whether there might be something "God- shaped" behind the strange allegories or parabolic tales he wrote. Now comes a book whose purpose is "to define, analyze, and integrate the philosophy of the God- idea with basic thematic structures which support the entire fictional canon" (9) . For those familiar at least with Waiting for Godot and Watt or the trilogy Molloy, Malone Dies , and The Unnamable, Laura Barge's complex study of the God-idea in selected (because typical) works is well worth reading, particularly the opening two chapters. In the essay bearing the witty title "Beckett, God, and Their Critics," Barge gives an annotated listing of "critics who attempt to connect the writer and his various protagonists with a positive attitude toward orthodox Christian belief' (16). Begin- ning with the first of these Christian-positive critics, G. S. Fraser, whose essay ap- peared in the Times Literary Supplement of 10 February 1956, 1 found myself engaged in spirited argument with Barge, quite filling up the margin of her book with such comments as "Why has she not considered that Vladimir and Estragon may be a pseudocouple? Why does she say they do not avoid presumption and despair?" Why, indeed? Barge claims that all who read any of Beckett' s works as being orthodoxly Christian are marked by five faults: over- reliance on Christian imagery and symbolism, failure to link facts, unfounded assumptions, imposition of their own ideas, and inability to see Beckett's irony. Similarly, Barge and others who contend that, though Beckett may be preoccupied with God, his view is entirely negative may be said to have their faults of misreading: under- reliance on Christian imagery and symbolism, ignorance or evasion of allusions (not only to technical religious terms, such as "fraction," but also to Christian works or to writers who were either Christian or at least familiar with the English Bible and the Book of Common Prayer), failure to appreciate that there is in Beckett's work a maturation of the view of God from the smart-young- man rhetoric of More Pricks Than Kicks and Murphy to the more positive approaches of the post- war works, inability to see that Beckett's irony is not all-pervasive but is usually matched to character or situation, and, finally, the usual defects of making un- founded assumptions or imposing one's own ideas. In regard to the last two flaws, Barge asserts for example that "no particular religious direction" can be ascertained in the works or the author. Ignoring for a moment the Anglican allusions in the works, Beckett himself has given us direction: "They can put me wherever they want, but it's Johnson, always Johnson, who is with me. And if I follow any tradition, it is his" (31). The tradition he speaks of is, of course, the Anglican tradition, at once Catholic and Reformed, allusions to which appear often in his works. It might be noted in passing that Beckett shares with the other Samuel the qualities of humility and charity. Barge also claims that Beckett is not a mystic; she may be right, for he joked about himself as a "dud mystic" in his younger days. However, he certainly is well ac- quainted with the writings of St. John of the Cross and Juliana of Norwich, and he would probably state that mystical union with God (whether possible or not) is a more valid approach to the divine than anthropomorphism, which is consistently ridiculed in Beckett's works. Barge's own understanding of the word "mysticism" is not clarified by the entries on this topic in the index. Barge's summaries of the novels rarely reflect the biblical texts to which Beckett often alludes, particularly in Watt but also in the trilogy and in Godot , as well as in the more recent short stories. If one is going to leave out many of the scriptural and other religious allusions (interpreted ironically or not), whatever is left in Beckett's tales will tend to display the negative aspects of fallen humanity. At the beginning of reading Barge's book, I thought she was going to focus on the "perhaps" aspect of Beckett. This she does in her last sentence, largely a quotation</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 225 from Godot. But the book as a whole focuses on the negative view of Christianity, as seen in literary criticism if not necessarily in Beckett's works. In spite of the above reservations, however, the book is thoughtful and thorough, especially in regard to philosophy, which actually looms larger than religion in this critical consideration of Beckett's work. Barge's own contribution - a four-point summation of the theology of Beckett and/ or of his characters - is a distinct and specific step on the way to understanding Beckett's religious position, even though I personally might have phrased the points a little differently. So, likewise, are the summaries of what is happening in the parabolic tales, though with Scripture and some Christian allusions omitted the overarching impression one gains may be negative rather than neutral or positive. The index is thorough, although, of course, it does not refer to Johnson or the Bible. Helene L. Baldwin Frostburg State University</page></plain_text>
