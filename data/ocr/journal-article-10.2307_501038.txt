<plain_text><page sequence="1">Plumbate -A Mesoamerican Trade Ware, by Anna O. Shepard; Publication 573 of the Car- negie Institution of Washington. Pp. viii +176, figs. 4 and map. Washington, D. C. 1948. This excellent monograph on plumbate ware is an important contribution to the field of Mesoamerican archaeology. It can also be read with profit by any student as an illustration of the vital role which good ceramic studies may play in archaeological research. Of more than four hundred pottery specimens here examined the only large group scientifically excavated was that recovered at Tajumulco, Guatemala, by Miss Dutton and Miss Hobbs, who generously gave it to Miss Shepard for study. Small sherd collections from other Guatemalan sites were also available as well as some of early date from Kaminaljuyu, San Augustin, and El Baul. To these are added plumbate from public museums and private collections in the United States and Mesoamerica. Plumbate is an attractive ware with an exception- ally hard surface ranging in color from grey to orange, and of a high luster and iridescence. It occurs in vari- ous shapes, including effigies. Although long recog- nized as a significant and widely distributed trade ware in Mesoamerica, neither its true nature nor place of origin have been known to archaeologists. Skillfully employing in her analysis microscopic, petrographic and other means of scientific observation, Miss Shepard is able to slough away a number of old untested theories. The idea is rapidly demolished that a slip or paste containing lead is responsible for the unique character of plumbate ware. The old term "plumbate," however, is retained in spite of its con- notations, for the author feels that a change at this late date would be sheer pedantry. On grounds of style as well as geographic and stratigraphic location, Miss Shepard concludes that plumbate ware probably origi- nated in western Guatemala, and that its makers were familiar with at least part of the Mexican pantheon when they were manufacturing ware of the fully de- veloped Tohil phase. The type of plumbate designated as San Juan probably represents an earlier period. The text, written in a clear and direct style, includes preface and introduction, eight chapters, and three well thought out appendices. There is also a complete bibliography. The first section deals with style: vessel forms, work- manship and decorative techniques, animal and an- thropomorphic effigies, imitations of plumbate. Sty- listic details have been excellently drawn by Miss Noguchi. Many full page figures accompany the text and are conveniently arranged so that reference and picture usually face each other. The silhouettes, varia- tions in shading, and graphs are easily understood. Miss Shepard's decision to forego endless sections of vessel walls seems well justified. These shapes and their frequencies are shown schematically. The jar is the most common plumbate shape. The numerous photographs, although small, are mostly very good. They give a fair idea of the known range of plumbate, but are not reproduced to scale. This is sometimes un- fortunate. However, Miss Shepard compensates in</page><page sequence="2">456 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY part for the discrepancies in size by drawing specific attention to the arrangement in her text. She also pro- vides a table of minimum, maximum, and average sizes for the chief shapes. Appendix A lists the height of each vessel illustrated with other data: provenience, collection, condition, and reference to previous publication. In her treat- ment of abstract designs the author introduces termi- nology taken from G. D. Birkhoff (Aesthetic Measure, Cambridge 1933). In Appendix B she explains her reasons for this and also for her shift from the Ridge- way to the Munsell color charts which she hopes will be adopted by all ceramic students. Section two deals with the cultural significance of the anthropomorphic effigies. Three groups are dis- tinguished: (1) those which almost certainly represent Mexican Gods; (2) those which compare best with Mexican deities, but, lacking unmistakable attributes are only tentatively classified as such; (3) those com- parable to no deity. The necessarily subjective nature of these categories is recognized. Nevertheless, the evi- dence is strong enough to make Miss Shepard feel that the plumbate potters may well have been people "of Mexican extraction" who migrated into Maya terri- tory, but she insists rightly that the composition of materials must always be the primary guide to the place of origin of a ware. The third section on technology is one which the author's special training enables her to handle with authority. The details of her procedure are relegated to Appendix C. The distinctive surface of plumbate ware is due in part to the nature of its fine textured slip, probably added by dipping. This has a high iron content, and, when properly fired in a reducing atmos- phere of about 950' C., becomes truly glazed; but the potters seem never to have controlled the firing process fully. Polishing marks are not found on the surface of plumbate; on the contrary, the finish is often careless. The polish and luster seem to be solely the result of the action of certain chemical and physical properties of the fired clay. Section four sets up criteria for identifying plumbate ware. In the fifth part the author collects material pertinent to geographic distribution. An outline map of Mesoamerica unfolds conveniently beyond the pages of the book. Among other things, it is here shown that the proportion of bowls is much greater in Guatemala than in Salvador. The distribution of the effigies suggests the interesting possibility that plum- bate potters may have recognized the demands of spe- cial markets. Section six thoroughly reviews the excavated plumbate in relation to its archaeological context. Miss Shepard here explains how her views on plum- bate differ from those expressed by Miss Dutton and Miss Hobbs in their Tajumulco publication (B. P. Dutton and H. R. Hobbs, Excavations at Tajumulco, Guatemala, Monograph of the School of American Re- search, No. 9, Santa Fe 1943). The next chapter is an inspection of wares associated with plumbate. The final short chapter is a masterly recapitulation of the present plumbate situation, its problems and their significance. Mesoamerican scholars owe thanks to Miss Shepard for clearing away the rubbish from plumbate and making an impressive start in deter- mining the true place of this important ware. Since her manuscript was completed in 1945, it contains no full treatment of the very interesting and probably early phase of plumbate excavated from Sr. Vitalio Roble's Finca Paraiso near Colombia, but it is mentioned in the preface. We should be most fortunate if Miss Shepard were to follow up the present publication with a study of this ware. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY C. MCCLELLAN SIR JOHN BEAZLEY The Hellenic Society has decided to dedicate the 71st volume of its Journal (due to appear in the summer of 1951) to Sir John Beazley on his 65th birthday, and has invited a number of scholars who are both members of the Society and friends of Sir John Beazley to contribute articles. As there are many outside the Society who will wish to be associated in any tribute to Sir John Beazley, it has also been decided to publish separately a bibliography of his work, together with a portrait. The subscription to the bibliography has been set at 10/-; and a list of subscribers will be included. Members of the Hellenic Society will receive this volume of the Journal as a part of the normal series, but they will not receive the bibliography unless they subscribe for it. Others will receive the bibliography if they subscribe 10/-; or the bibliography and the special number of the Journal if they subscribe ?3. A number of public bodies and individuals have already given donations to help meet the extra costs of producing this volume of the Journal, which will be very heavy. Further gifts towards this and the bibliography are earnestly solicited. Subscriptions must be received by the Secretary of thel Hellenic Society, 50 Bedford Square, London 7 W.C.1., before February 1st, 1951, in order that names may be printed in the list.</page></plain_text>
