INTRODUCTION The literature of the Saiva Mantramärga is dominated by the pre scription of the rituals through which the Saivas initiated candi dates into their religious discipline (dïksa), consecrated successors to office (abhisekah), installed images and other substrates of wor ship (prat ist ha), and performed the repeated services of worship (.yagah) and propitiation (mantrasädhanam) required of all or cer tain classes among them.1 By studying this literature, which extends 1 I adopt Mantramärga ('the Path of Mantras') as the Saivas' term for what Indologists have commonly called Tantric or Ägamic Saivism. It serves to differen tiate this Saivism from that of the Atimärga, "the Path Beyond [the brahmanical socio-religious order]", the earlier and contemporaneous Saivism of the Pâsu pata divisions, principally the Päncärthikas, Lakulas/Kâlamukhas and Soma siddhäntins/Käpälikas. The Mantramärga comprises a number of related systems. The principal among them and their principal surviving scriptures are (1) the Sid dhänta taught in the Nisväsa, the Pauskara, the Sväyambhuvasütrasamgraha, the Rauravasütrasamgraha, the Kälottaras, the Matanga, the Kirana, the Mrgendra, the Paräkhya, the Brhatkdlottara, etc., (2) the Vämasaiva cult of Tumburu and his four sisters taught in the VTnäsikha, (3) the Daksinasaiva cult of Svacchandabhairava taught in the Svacchanda, (4) the Yämala cult of KapalTsa and Candä Kâpâlinï taught in the Picumata (/Brahmaydmala), (5) the Trika cult of the goddesses Para, etc. taught in the SiddhayogesvarTmata, the Tantrasadbhäva, the Mälimvijayottara, etc., (6) the Katïkula cult of KälasamkarsanT/Kätl taught in the Jayadrathaydmala and the scriptures of the Krama (Kâlïkulapancasataka, Kâtîkulakramasadbhava, etc.), (7) the cult of Kubjikä taught in the Kubjikâmata, etc., (8) the cult of Tripura sundarf taught in the Nityäsodasikärnava, etc., and (9) the cult of Amrtesvara and/ or Amrtalaksmï taught in the Netra.

But these sources are much less revealing about agency, social milieu, and historical context. They do provide us with some gen eral rules of restriction and permission concerning which categories of person may or may not be initiated or officiate and concerning the extent to which their mundane social status influences their sta tus in the community of co-initiates, and these rules are different in the different Saiva systems, which reveals something of their charac ter and interrelation within the larger social world. But they provide no data, and we are not likely to discover any from other sources, that would enable us to judge, for example, what percentage of the population in a given region and time was involved in the practice or support of the religion, or how its followers and supporters were distributed between castes, economic classes, age-groups, genders and levels or type of involvement. In other words the texts tell us what was possible for various groups but not the extent to which these possibilities were put into practice. There is nothing here like the evidence provided by the records of the government departments that supervised the conduct of religion in China and Japan. The kingdoms of South and Southeast Asia engaged in some such super vision and must have maintained the sort of records that would have enabled us to address these questions. But they have not been pre served. All we have from that quarter are what happens to have sur vived and come to light of inscriptions on stone or copper plates recording major grants or pious works. This is crucial information for the historian of Saivism, as it is for students of all Indian reli gious traditions, and in some areas, such as that of the Khmers, it and archaeology provide the only evidence that we have. But at best it instantiates or challenges the model of possibilities conveyed by the prescriptive literature. It does not enable us to go beyond its range into detailed social history. Nonetheless it is possible, I would say necessary, to read the literature and inscriptions with the sort of questions in mind that a social historian would wish to ask.</page><page sequence="3">SAIVA OFFICIANTS - THE KING'S BRAHMANICAL CHAPLAIN 23 1 In this perspective it seems to me that active initiates are likely to have been few in number and to have been concentrated among, though by no means confined to, brahmin men. Yet Saivism exerted an influence on the religious life of the Indian world that far exceeds what might be expected of such a minority, especially from one out side the mainstream of brahmanical observance. For there can be no doubt that for several centuries after the sixth it was the princi pal faith of the élites in large parts of the Indian subcontinent and in both mainland and insular Southeast Asia. Only Mahäyäna Bud dhism was able to rival it during this period; and when it achieved success in this rivalry, either equalling or excelling Saivism as the beneficiary of patronage, it was in a form led by the Way of Man tras, a system of ritual, meditation and observance in which Bud dhism had redesigned itself, if not in essence, then at least in style and range of functions, on the model of its rival. I attribute this success to three factors. The first is that though the practice of the religion proper was restricted to the initiated, they cultivated the support of a wider community of uninitiated, lay devotees. An unpublished corpus of texts comprising principally the Sivadharma and the Sivadharmottara, contains the observances recommended to this laity, revealing that following the example of the Buddhists the Saivas had propagated a lesser religion of merit gathering that centred on the support and veneration of the persons and institutions of the religion proper, promising that those who followed it would be rewarded in death by a period in the paradise of Siva (sivalokah, rudralokah) before returning to the world in the most desirable of rebirths.2 The second is that the Saivism of the Mantramärga developed in practice a thorough accommodation of the brahmanical religion that it claimed to transcend, thus minimizing, even eliminating, the offence it gave as a tradition whose scriptures, like those of the Bud dhists, were seen to be, and claimed to be, outside the corpus of the Vedas. These Saivas were to accept that the brahmanical tradition alone was valid in the domain it claimed for itself and that they 2 For further information on this corpus of texts and for evidence in it of inter action with the king and his court see Sanderson, forthcoming.</page><page sequence="4">232 ALEXIS SANDERSON were bound to follow its prescriptions and incorporate its rituals beside their own wherever practicable.3 Similarly, where they established themselves at the many Saiva temple sites that pre-existed them they did not attempt to reform worship by restricting it to the narrow pantheon that they propiti ated as initiates. This they imposed on the worship of Siva in the Linga at the heart of these foundations; but they also took over, preserved, and regulated in accordance with the expectations of the uninitiated laity a much wider range of ancillary deities, deities that have no place in the scriptures and ritual manuals of the Man tramärga other than in treatments of their installation and iconog raphy in this special context.4 The third and most vital factor is that the religion succeeded in forging close links with the institution of kingship and thereby with the principal source of patronage. I see four main elements 3 Transgressing the rules of the brahmanical socio-religious system, known to the Saivas as the mundane religion (laukiko dharmah), is forbidden in a much cited passage from the lost Saiddhäntika Bhärga\ottara\ iti varnäsramäcärän manasäpi na laiïghayet/yo yasminn âsrame tisthan dïksitah sivasâsane/sa tasminn eva samtisthec chivadharmam ca pälayet 'So he should not transgress the practices of his caste-class and order of iife even in thought. He should remain in the order in which he was when he was initiated into the Saiva religion and [at the same time] maintain the ordinances of Siva'. It is cited at, e.g., Naresvaraparîksâprakâsa ad 3.76. See also Sarvajnänottara cited in Tanträlokaviveka ad 4.25lab, and Matangapäramesvara, Caryäpada 2.2-7b. That the Saivas, at least those following the Saiddhäntika forms of observance, came to be widely accepted as co-religion ists in traditional brahmanical circles is evident from the report of the Kashmirian philosopher Jayantabhatta, a contemporary of king Sankaravarman (r. 883-902), in NyäyamanjarT vol. 1, p. 636, 1.15-p. 637, 1.4; p. 637, 11. 16-19; p. 638, 11. 12-13. He defends the validity of the Saiva scriptures and claims that his position is that of the society of respectable Àryas (mahâjanah), which he defines as comprising all who live within the system of the four caste-classes and orders of life in accor dance with the ordinances of the Veda. See also Sanderson, 1995, pp. 27-38. 4 The principal of these ancillaries were Durgä MahisäsuramardinT, Umä, Ganesa, Skanda, Visnu, Brahma, Surya, Laksrriï, Sarasvafl, the Lokapälas, the Grahas, the Mother goddesses (Mätrs), and a number of non-Mantramärgic Siva forms: (1) a simple single-faced Siva with two or more arms, (2) Harihara or Saiika ranäräyana, in which the left half of Siva's body is Visnu, (3) ArdhanärTsvara or Gaunsvara, inwhichthis half is his consort Umä, (4) the dancing Rudra, called vari ously Nrtyarudra, Nrttesvara, Nrtyesvara, Natesvara, Nätakesvara and Nätyesvara, and (5) Umamahesvara, also called Umesa and Umärudra, in which Umä sits on Siva's left thigh with his arm around her. Early sources that cover their iconography are the Pratisthätantras Devyämata, Mayasamgraha, Pingalämata, and Mohacüro ttara, and the general scripture Kirana (Patala 52). See Sanderson, 2005, pp. 435—440.</page><page sequence="5">SAIVA OFFICIANTS - THE KING'S BRAHMANICAL CHAPLAIN 233 here: (1) the occupying by Saiva officiants of the office of Royal Preceptor (räjaguruh) and in this position their giving Saiva initia tion (dïksâ) to the monarch followed by a specially modified version of the Saiva consecration ritual (abhisekah) as an empowerment to rule beyond that conferred by the conventional brahmanical royal consecration (räjyäbhisekah); (2) the promoting by Saiva officiants of the practice of displaying and legitimating a dynasty's power by their officiating in the founding of Saiva temples in which the new Sivas that they enshrined bore as the individuating first half of their names that of the royal founder or, where complexes of royal Siva temples were established, those of the founder and any kin that he might designate for this purpose; (3) the provision of a repertoire of protective, therapeutic and aggressive rites for the benefit of the monarch and his kingdom; and (4) the development of Saiva rituals and their applications to enable a specialized class of Saiva officiants to encroach on the territory of the Räjapurohita, the brahmanical expert in the rites of the Atharvaveda who served as the personal priest of the king, warding off all manner of ills from him through apotropaic rites, using sorcery to attack his enemies, fulfilling the manifold duties of regular and occasional worship on his behalf, and performing the funerary and other postmortuary rites when he or other members of the royal family died.5 In a forthcoming monograph I have provided detailed evidence of the first of these four factors.6 Here I consider the fourth, and, by way of introduction, the third. For the two overlap. As we shall see, a Saiva Guru acting in the role of a king's personal chaplain was expected, like his brahmanical counterpart, to perform rites to protect the king and kingdom. But the two factors must be distin guished, since the performance of such rites was also commissioned from independent Saiva Gurus acting outside this role. 2. STATE PROTECTION BY INDEPENDENT SAIVA OFFICIANTS An inscription of the fifth year of the reign of the Cola emperor Räjädhiräja II (r. 1163-79 or 1166-82) tells us that when an army from Sri Lanka had invaded the mainland, removed the door of the Rämesvaram temple, obstructed the worship, and carried away all 5 See Sanderson, forthcoming, for textual sources requiring the royal chaplain to be an Atharvavedin or expert in the apotropaic and other rites of the Atharvavedic tradition.

According to the inscription the cere mony was continued for twenty-eight days and at its end the invad ing army was indeed defeated.7 Another example of a ritual performed by a Saiva officiant for the good of the state is seen in a Sanskrit and Old Khmer inscrip tion of ad 1052 from Sdok Kak Thorn. This reports that a certain Hiranyadäma was commissioned by Jayavarman II (r. 802-c. 835) at the time of his founding of the unified kingdom of the Khmers to perform a ritual of the Vämasaiva system that would guarantee that unity and the kingdom's independence from Java:8 man vrähmana jmah hiranyadäma präjna siddhi vidyä mok amvi jana pada pi vrah päda paramesvara ahjen thve vidhi leha leh kam pi kamvu jadesa neh äyatta ta java ley len äc ti kamraten phdai karom mväy guh ta ja cakravartti vrähmana noh thve vidhi toy vrah vinäsikha pratistha kamrateri jagat ta räja vrähmana noh paryyan vrah vinäsikha nayottara sanmoha sirascheda svah man svat ta mukha cuh pi sarsir pi paryann steh ah sivakaivalya nu gi K. 235, Old Khmer text, 11. 71-74 Then a brahmin called Hiranyadäma, who was learned in the Mantras that bestow Siddhi, came from Janapada. The Venerable Paramesvara [Jayavarman II] requested him to perform a ritual so that this land of 7 ARE 20 of 1899 at Arppakkam, a village eight miles SSE of Kancipuram; Sil 4, no. 456; summary in Sastri (1984, p. 368). For a translation of the relevant part see ARE 1899, paragraph 34. 8 Cœdès thought (1968, p. 100) that this Java was the island of Java. But the iden tification is uncertain. Vickery proposes that it was Champa (Skt. campa), the land of the Chams to the east in Southern Vietnam, claiming that "y'avä/chvea/ has been used in Khmer until modem times to designate the Cham" (1998, p. 29; see also pp. 387 and 405). Champa and the Chams are frequently mentioned in the inscriptions but never under this name, and in modem Khmer, according to the Cham scholar Phoen (1987, p. 78), the term cited refers not to the Chams but to Malays descended from Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian archipelago and the Malay peninsula in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The Khmer expression "cam jva" [i.e. cham chvéa\ refers, he reports, to the Muslim community in Cambodia in general as compris ing both Chams and these Malays. Guesdon (1930, s.v.) gives chvéa in the mean ing Java and by extension the Malay peninsula ("malaisie"). It is therefore more probable that the independence to which the inscription refers was from a king dom in maritime Southeast Asia, probably that of the Sailendras of Snvijaya cen tred in southeastern Sumatra.</page><page sequence="7">SAIVA OFFICIANTS - THE KING'S BRAHMANICAL CHAPLAIN 235 the Kambujas would no longer be subject to Java and only one king would rule over it with sovereign power. That brahmin performed the ritual [for those ends] following the venerable Vinäsikha9 and es tablished the [image of the] Kamrateh Jagat ta Räja. The brahmin [then] taught the Vinäsikha, the Nayottara, the Sammoha and the Sirascheda. He recited them from beginning to end so that they could be written down, and taught them to Steh an Sivakaivalya. In none of these cases is it clear that the officiants engaged were placing themselves beyond the domain of occasional rites for the benefit of others by becoming priests tied to the service of the king or the state. Much material in the Saivas' prescriptive literature is similarly ambiguous. For example, the Uttarabhäga of the Lingapuräna, which in spite of its claim to be a Purâna, is in large part a thinly-disguised Paddhati text of the Saiva Mantramärga, teaches in addition to the rituals of Saiddhäntika Linga worship and installation (1) fire-sacri fices in which offerings are made to the Aghora aspect of Siva (in fact to the principal Daksinasaiva deity Svacchandabhairava, though this is not made explicit in the text) for the benefit of the king, to ward off danger from him and to restore his health,10 and 9 This is evidently the published Vinasikha, the only complete Vamasaiva scripture to have reached us. The form Vinäsikha in the Old Khmer text is con firmed by the Sanskrit (v. 28, cited below), where the metre requires the first syl lable to be short. The error may be attributed to the passage of two and a half centuries between the introduction of these texts and the inscription. There is no reason to assume that the Sanskrit original continued to be studied alongside the Paddhati based on it throughout this period. 10 See especially Lihgapurana, Uttarabhäga, chapters 19-27 and 46-54. As a text seeking acceptance as a Puräna and thereby as a work within the corpus of Veda derived revelation, it disguises its properly Saiva character by jettisoning such distinctively Saiva doctrines as that of the thirty-six reality-levels (tattväni). It is, I surmise, in the same spirit that it has avoided identifying its Aghora as Svaccha ndabhairava, the deity of the Svacchandatantra. That this is the true identity of the deity is apparent in chapter 26, which is devoted to the worship of Aghora in the Linga or, less desirably, on a Sthandila, as an alternative to the regular Saiddhäntika Siva worship in the Linga taught, with the necessary diksa and ritual of Linga installa tion, in chapters 19-25 and 46-47. A royal fire-sacrifice to this deity is taught in 49 and a ritual for destroying the king's enemies in which the worshipper visualizes himself as the same is taught in 50. The true name of the deity is not used, no doubt because of its strongly non-Vedic associations, but his visualization (dhyänam) in 26.15—21 b reveals his identity since it is of the five-faced and eighteen-armed Sva cchandabhairava taught in Svacchanda 2.81 c—97. All the hand-attributes are identi cal if, as I propose, we emend to mundam the inappropriate dandam seen in 26.19c of the published text.</page><page sequence="8">236 ALEXIS SANDERSON (2) an elaborate Säkta Saiva procedure to guarantee that the king will be victorious when he goes into battle.11 All this is very much within the purview of the purposes of the rituals of the brahmanical royal chaplain, but nothing in the text tells us whether the officiant envisaged is a person acting in that role or an independent Guru condescending to act for the benefit of the king in special circum stances, like Jnänasiva in the reign of Räjädhiräja II or Hiranyadäma in that of Jayavarman II. 3. THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF STATE PROTECTION In the last of these cases we have a record of a single ritual per formed for state-protection by a Guru who was not in the king's service. But this instance also shows how such rituals could become regularized by transference to priests who were in such service. For the Sivakaivalya to whom Hiranyadama taught these four texts, the principal scriptures of the Väma division of the Saiva canon, was Jayavarman II's Räjapurohita.12 The king had him appointed to perform the regular worship of the image, the Kamraten Jagat ta Räja (Skt. Devaräja), that Hiranyadama had established after this ritual as the focus of a cult to protect the state; and it was agreed that the duty and right to worship before this image should be passed down through ascetics in Sivakaivalya's matriline: 25 jayavarmmamahTbhrto mahendrâ vanibhrnmürdhakrtäspadasya sästä kavir äryavarängavanditänghrih sivakaivalya iti praütir äsTt 26 hiranyadämadvijapungavo 'gryadhïr iväbjayonih karunärdra ägatah ananyalabdhäm khalu siddhim ädarät prakäs'ayäm äsa mahïbhrtam prati 11 The large number of Sakta goddesses worshipped in the one thousand vases for the 'consecration for victory' (jayâbhisekah) taught in chapter 27 are drawn from various parts of the Kaula Kubjikamata (14.77-79, 81-85, 87, 91; 15.6-7, 20, 22, 27, 30, 48; 9.3c^l, 5, 6; 10.120c-123, 124c-127; 21.16-20b; 22.16A, 1-9, 10-25 end; 2.59; 14.75, 77-79, 81, 84-85, 87, 91, etc.). But the procedure also includes Saiddhäntika, Daksina and Vaidika elements. 12 The Sanskrit part of the inscription refers to Sivakaivalya as the Guru and Hotar of Jayavarman II (v. 25: jayavarmmamahTbhrto ... sästä/kavir ... sivakaivalya iti; v. 27bc: asmai/holre). The Khmer refers to him as the Guru and Purohita of the king (C II. 61-62: steii aii sivakaivalya ta aji prajna ja guru jä purohita ta vrah päda paramesvara).</page><page sequence="9">SAIVA OFFICIANTS - THE KING'S BRAHMANICAL CHAPLAIN 237 27 sa bhüdharenänumato 'grajanmä sasädhanäm siddhim adiksad asmai hotre hitaikäntamanahprasattim sambibhrate dhämavibrmhanäya 28 sästram siraschedavinäsikhäkhyam sammohanämäpi nayottarakhyam tat tumvuror vaktracatuskam asya siddhyeva vipras samadarsayat sah 29 dvijas samuddhrtya sa sästrasäram rahasyakausalyadhiyä sayatnah siddhu vvahantïh kila devaräjä bhikhyäm vidadhre bhuvanarddhivrddhyai 30 sa bhüdharendras sahavipravaryyas tasmin vidhau dhämanidhänahetau vTtäntaräyam bhuvanodayäya niyojayäm âsa munïsvaran tarn 31 tanmatrvamse yatayas striyo vä jätä + + + tra niyuktabhäväh tadyäjakäs syur na kathancid anya iti ksitmdradvijakalpan äsTt 61 samadhikadhisanäs te sürivaryyäs tadä tair dharanipatibhir abhyarnnürhanäbhyarhamyäh nagaranihitasamsthä devaräjasya nänye sayamaniyamayatnäh pratyahan cakrur arccäm K. 235, 25-31, 61 King Jayavarman, who had made his residence on the summit of Mount Mahendra,13 had as his Guru a poet called Sivakaivalya, whose feet had been honoured by [contact with] the heads of [prostrating] Äryas.

The Brahman revealed to him as though by means of [this] Siddhi the four faces of Tumburu that are the [Varna scriptures] Sirascheda, Vinäsikha, Sammoha and Nayottara, and in order to increase the prosperity of the realm he carefully extracted the essence of [those] texts through his mastery of the esoteric [teachings] and [with it] established the Siddhis that bear the name Devaraja. Then the king with [the support of] this excellent Brahman appointed [Siva kaivalya,] this lord among sages, to officiate in this ritual that is the cause of the treasure of power, in order that the realm should prosper without impediments. The king and the foremost of brahmins provided Phnom Kulen.</page><page sequence="10">238 ALEXIS SANDERSON that ascetics or women born in the latter's maternal lineage, and no oth ers under any circumstances, should be appointed to this ... and per form its worship. Excellent scholars of the highest intelligence, settled by these kings in the capital because they wished to have them nearby to venerate them as they deserved, they and they alone, performed the daily service of the Devaräja, zealously maintaining the major and minor restraints [of the ascetic's discipline]. We see similar cases of regularization of rites of royal protection in our evidence for the Buddhist Way of Mantras. The Rgya gar chos 'byun, the Tibetan history of Indian Buddhism completed by Täranätha in ad 1608, reports that in order to protect his dynasty, expand its rule, and spread the Buddhist religion the Päla king Dharmapäla (r. c. 775 812) had a fire-sacrifice performed regularly for many years by Tan tric officiants under the direction of his Guru Buddhajnänapäda at an overall cost of 902,000 tolas of silver.14 An inscription of the reign of Jayavarman V (r. c. 968-c. 1000/1) reveals a similar arrangement in the Khmer court of Angkor. It tells us that one Klrtipapdita, a Mahäyänist scholar and adept of the Buddhist Yogatantras, who had been adopted by the royal family as their Guru, was frequently engaged by the king to perform apotro paic, restorative and aggressive Mantra rituals within the royal pal ace for the protection of his kingdom.15 4. SAIVA OFFICIANTS IN THE ROLE OF THE RÄJAPUROHITA Even in the case of the hereditary Khmer priests of the Kamraten Jagat ta Räja there is no reason to think that they were Räjapuro hitas in the narrow sense of the term, that is to say, personal chap lains performing the whole repertoire of ritual duties, namely 14 For these reports see Chimpa and Chattopadhyaya (1970, pp. 274, 278-279). At present one tola (Skt. tulä) is approx. 11.7 grammes.

This is the Saiva Netratantra, a work of approximately 1,300 stanzas that sets out rit ual observances based on the propitiation of the deity Amrtesvara (/Amrtesa), also known as Amrtesabhairava, and/or his consort Amrtalaksml.18 It has come down to us in Kashmirian manuscripts with a learned commentary written from the non-dualistic Saiva point of view by the Kashmirian Ksemaräja in the early part of the eleventh century and it was published therewith on the basis of two of these manu scripts in the Kashmir Series of Texts and Studies in 1926 and 1939.19 16 The daily, periodic and occasional religious duties of the king and his per sonal chaplain are set out in the Atharvavedaparista. See also Visnudharmottara 2, Adhyäyas 5, 18-23, 132-144, 151-162, 176-177 (see n. 68 below for a listing of the rituals covered); NTlamata 810-848; Ädipuräna-Tithikrtya 11. 2618-3010; Brhatsamhitä, Adhyäyas 42 (Indra festival) and 43 (Nîrajanasânti). 17 For this classification see Atharvavedaparisista 3.1.10: yasyànyakulopayuktah purodhâh santikapaustikaprâyascittïyâbhicârikanaimittikaurdhvadehikàny atharvavi hitänikarmäni kuryät. 18 Amrtesvara is also known as Mrtyunjaya/Mrtyujit and as Netranätha. The Aisa form Amrtlsa (Amrthsa) is also attested. The name Amrtalaksrm is found not in the Netra itself, where she is simply Sri/LaksmT, but in the ritual manuals based on that text. Amrtesvara and Amrtalaksrm may be worshipped independently or as a pair. 19 Hitherto the only substantial scholarly attention paid to this work as a whole has been an account of its contents published by Brunner (1974). While generally accurate that is a summary rather than an analysis and it is one that does not rec ognize what I identify as the distinctive and pervasive character of this text, namely that it envisages atypical Saiva officiants operating outside their traditional territory in that of the king's chaplain.</page><page sequence="12">240 ALEXIS SANDERSON Its high standing in Kashmir is indicated by the composition and preservation of this commentary, by the fact that the cult of its dei ties, taught only in the Netratantra, is one of the two principal bases of the Saivism of the Kashmirian ritual manuals in use until recent times,20 by the survival of three previously unidentified images of Amrtesvara and his consort Amrtalaksm! in the small corpus of known non-Buddhist Kashmirian bronzes,21 and by the fact that a 20 The other is that of Svacchandabhairava taught in the Svacchandatantra. In the Kashmirian Saiva manuals of ritual the principal deities (mantracakram) are gener ally Svacchandabhairava (Sakalabhattäraka [=Aghora] and Niskalabhattäraka) with Aghoresvarl and Amrtesvarabhairava with AmrtalaksmT at the centre of the Yäga surrounded by the Bhairavas of the Svacchandatantra. See, e.g., Kalädtksävidhi ff. 25v8-30v8; Agnikaryapaddhati A f. 16r; and Sivanirvanavidhi pp. 257, 1.12-263, 1. 11. The Kashmirian digest Nityädisamgrahapaddhati, compiled by Räjänaka Taksakavarta at an unknown time after the completion of the Somasam bhupaddhati in AD 1095/6, that being the latest of the datable works cited by him, distinguishes among the Saiva initiates he is addressing between followers of the Siddhänta, followers of the Netratantra, and followers of the Svacchandatantra. 21 Two have been reproduced in Pal, 1975, plates 6 and 7. He assigns the first to"Kashmir or Afghanistan" and the tenth to eleventh century and the second to "Kashmir or Himachal Pradesh (?)" and the tenth century. The first has also been published by Reedy, who assigns it to Kashmir and the same period (1997, K85). A third found its way to a Buddhist temple in Ladakh and has been reproduced in Snellgrove and Skorupski, 1977, vol. 2, p. 77, Fig. 66. These scholars were not aware of the identity of the image. Nonetheless, Pal, followed by Reedy, asserts that it is "Umä-Mahesvara", and Snellgrove and Skorupski that it is Visnu with LaksmT. According to the visualization-texts (dhyanam) of these deities (Netra 3.17-23b; 18.63-69), to which these three bronzes conform precisely, Amrtesvara is crowned, white, one-faced, three-eyed, and four-armed, sitting on a white lotus at the centre of a lunar disc. In the proper right of his two inner hands he holds a vase of nec tar at his heart and a full moon held at head height in the left, the upper arm hor izontal and the forearm vertical. The outer right and left hands show the gestures of generosity and protection. The latter is invisible behind AmrtalaksmTs back in the bronzes. AmrtalaksmT has the same appearance except that she carries the dis cus and the conch rather than the vase and moon in her inner right and left hands. Her gesture of protection is visible in the bronzes. She sits in Amrtesvara's lap, on his left thigh, and, in the bronzes is considerably smaller than her consort. Among the other known non-Buddhist bronzes from Kashmir I am aware of only two others that belong to the domain of the Saiva Mantramärga. Both are images of the Katîkula's goddess SiddhalaksmT, identified in Sanderson (1990). No bronze of the Siddhänta's Sadäsiva or the Daksina's Svacchanda has come to light, though there are some modern paintings of the latter. The remaining non Buddhist bronzes are Päncarätrika images of Visnu and images of Siva and other gods proper to the domain of regular brahmanical observance.</page><page sequence="13">SAIVA OFFICIANTS - THE KING'S BRAHMANICAL CHAPLAIN 241 visualization verse for these deities recited in the Saiva rituals- was given pride of place in the non-Saiva fire-sacrifice of the Kashmirian brahmins, being recited before pouring the oblations that accompany the recitation of the Satarudriya of the Käthaka Yajurveda, the first in a series of five Vedic hymns to Rudra (the rudrapancakam).23 The Netratantra was not limited in its distribution and influence to Kashmir. We have a Nepalese manuscript of the text from the beginning of the thirteenth century;24 we have manuscripts in the same region of two texts, one of the early thirteenth century and the other probably so, that set out the procedures of its initiation cer emony and of the regular postinitiatory worship of its deities; and the inclusion of their worship in larger ritual contexts in the anony mous manuals in Newari and Sanskrit used by the Tantric officiants of the Kathmandu valley shows that the cult became and remained an integral part of Newar Saivism. Thus in the autumnal Navarätra ceremonies Amrtesabhairava and his retinue are the deities of the vase-worship (kalasapüjä) at the beginning of the installation of the royal sword (kh ad gast h äpana v idh ih ) on the eighth day (mahâstamï).25 The Nepalese texts that set out the procedures for initiation and subsequent regular worship reveal that the cult was practised in the royal family. The text on initiation, the AmrtesvaradTksdvidhi, envis ages no initiand but the king, since when it turns to the duties of the initiand on the day after the ceremony it requires him to return to the Guru in a full military parade accompanied by his minis 22 See, e.g., Sivanirvanavidhi p. 261: devam sudhakalasasomakaram trinetram pa dmäsanam ca varadäbhayadam susubhramjsankhäbhayäbjavarabhüsitayä ca devyä vä me 'nkitam samanabhangaharam namami 'I prostrate myself to the god who frees us from the torture of death, three-eyed, perfectly white, holding a vase of nectar and the moon, [showing the gestures of] bestowing boons and protection, seated on a lotus, marked on his left by the goddess adorned with a conch, [the gesture of] protection, a lotus and [the gesture of] bestowing boons'. 23 See Vedakalpadruma pp. 15-16. 24 NAK MS 1-285: 'Amrtesatantram'. In the colophons of this manuscript the work is referred to as the MrtyujidamrtTsavidhana.

The Netratantra, however, is exceptional in this respect. I propose that it contains evidence sufficient to justify the conclusion that it was 26 For this reference to the newly initiated king's procession in full military parade see Sanderson, forthcoming. 27 Amrtesvaradïksavidhi f. 19rl: bhairavasyamrtisasya diksatippanakam sphutamj visvesvarena racitam sajjanäs carcayantv idam. 28 Amrtesatantra f. 89v4-5: samaptam idam mrtyujidamrtisavidhanam sampurnam iti subham. samvat 320 caitra sudi 9 sanidine + + visvesvaralikhäpitam idam pusta kam. pamditakïrttidharalikhitam mayä. That this text is Nepalese is not certain, but it is probable. The account of initiation is supplemented by a passage on the Säkta vedhadiksä incorporated from the Kubjikdmata, a text of central importance in the Säkta-Saiva tradition of the Newars (f. 16rl 1—vi 1 «—10.83—92b, 94, 96-98 and 100-107). 29 For these dates see Petech (1958, pp. 76 and 82). 30 See Amrtesvarapüjä f. 7v2-3: srideväbhayamallena sadäcäryopadesinä/srïmrtyu hjayadevasya nityapüjävidhih krtah. ity amrtesvarapujanam samaptam (see also Petech, 1958, p. 89, citing its palm-leaf exemplar NAK MS 1-1365.5); Amrtesvarapüjä f. lv5-6 (v. 2): pïyûsasindhulaharïsatasiklapadmamadhye sphurattuhinarasmimarïcisubhram/ natvä mahesam amalam kamaläsahäyam abhyarcanam vitanute 'bhayamalladevah. NAK MS 1-1365.5 was copied on June 8, 1216 just before the end of the reign of Abha yamalla's father Arimalla (Petech, 1958, p. 84). Other relevant Nepalese manu scripts are Amrtesvarapüjägnikäryavidhäna, Amrlasüryapüjävidhi with drawings of the deities, 'Püjäkända', which contains inter alia an Amrtabhairavärcanavidhi penned in AD 1277/8, an AmrtTsabhairavabhattärakähnikavidhi, and an Amrtasüryärcanavidhi. Amrtasürya is Amrtesvara in the form of the Sun God, the worship of this ectype being prescribed before that of the deity proper, as was standard procedure in the Siddhänta, whose Paddhatis prescribe a cult of Sivasürya before that of Siva. There is no such preliminary in the Netra itself. The icon of Amrtasürya created for this pur pose was the three-faced, eight-armed variant of the Sun God holding the weapons of the eight Lokapâlas taught (13.21c—25b) in the section of that text devoted to the ico nography of various non-Saiva deities, one of three forms of that God taught there.</page><page sequence="15">SA IVA OFFICIANTS - THE KINGS BRAHMANICAL CHAPLAIN 243 indeed produced in one of the two places in which we see evidence of its presence, namely Kashmir, and that it was composed there be tween c. 700 and c. 850, probably towards the end of that period.31 With the exception of an insertion of 95 verses seen in the Nepalese manuscript32 the only major difference between the transmissions of the Netratantra in that and the Kashmirian manuscripts is that the deviations from strictly grammatical Sanskrit that abound in the early Saiva scrip tures are much fewer in the latter, most of whose divergent readings are best explained as the result of rephrasing to remove such anomalies. In the citations that follow I have therefore privileged the readings of the Nepa lese manuscript (N) as evidence of an earlier state of the Kashmirian text.33 31 My reasons for proposing this provenance and date are set out in the Appendix. 32 This insertion (ff. 47rl-53r2) is placed after 18.3 of the published edition. The Nepalese manuscript treats this as the remainder of the 18th chapter (18.4-99). It then gives the whole of the edition's chapter 18, so repeating 18.1-3, as its chapter 19, and so on to the end, so that it has 23 chapters rather than the edition's 22. The subject-matter of the additional verses is hostile visualization rituals and fire-sacrifices in which the deity takes the form of Mahäbhairava. It has drawn on the Svacchanda: 18.62c-68b&lt;—9.62-67; 18.69-7 la^9.71-73a; 18.72ab^9.76ab; 18.73-78^6.72c-78b; 18.79-85a&lt;—6.85c-91c; 18.85b-87^6.92-94; and 19.92-95a&lt;-6.68c-71c. 33 Particularly notable among the Aisa usages accepted in my edition of the pas sages cited below is the use of genitives, instrumentais, locatives and ablatives/datives plural side by side in a single construction without difference of meaning: e.g. pisäcais cäpy anekasah / brahmaraksagraltädibhyah kotiso yadi mudritah 2.14bcd; nrpänäm nrpapatriinäm tatsutänäm dvijädisu 15.20cd; nrpatau tatsutänäm 18.112ab; duhsva pnair mätarXsu ca 19.98d; gosu brähmanaraksärtham ätmanah svajanesu ca 19.104ab; sälyädisu ca sasyesu phalamülodakena ca/durbhiksavyädhikäryesu utpätais cäpy anuttamaih 19.108. This licence surely reflects the development of the case endings in Middle Indo-Aryan as witnessed in the Apabhramsa stage, in which the locative and instrumental plural have merged, as have the dative, genitive and ablative plural (Ta gare 1987, pp. 141-150). Other typical features of the MIA-influenced register of San skrit seen here are the extended stems of mâtrïbhir 2.13c, mätarXsu 19.98d, dâvyâlAhà, bhübhrtänäm 12.7d, aristacihnitätmäno (nom. sg.; conj.; cf. Picumata f. 238v [52.15a]: sädhakas tu mahätmäno) 19.107a, and pasavesu (conj.; cf. Picumata f. 224r [46.34b]: pasavänäm) 19.120c; the contracted stems of sreyam in 19.105a and digväsam in 13.10c; -eta for -ayeta in the optative in abhimantreta 19.90c, 19.117d, and 19.119a; the dispensability of final t/d revealed in ksipe 'rtale (18.118b) for ksiped anale; the loss of declension in the numerals (catuh for catvärah in 18.121a); the neuter plural siddhïni in 18.79c and 19.115c; so forso in 16.113c; the non-causative base in the pseudo-causa tive abhisincayet in 19.109d; and 'yeta for -ayeta in püjyeta in 19.104c. Untypical is the use of pratisthäpyah in an active sense governing an object in the accusative in the phrase pratisthäpyah ... guruh ... bhîsanam rüpam 'the Guru should install the fright ening [Bhairava] form' in 18.119-120.

He is presented as the per former of rites for the protection and prosperity of all members of society, but this wider constituency is generally mentioned only after the text has specified the king, his wives and their children, who are the principal intended beneficiaries and in many cases the only ones. After various preliminaries the text introduces its subject as follows: 2.13 bhütayaksagrahonmädasäkimyogiriiganaih bhaginïrudramdtrïbhir dävyadämarikädibhih 14 rüpikäbhir apasmäraih pisäcais cäpy anekasah brahmaraksagrahädibhyah kotiso yadi mudritäh 15 apamrtyubhir äkräntäh kälapäsair jighämsitäh räjäno räjalanayä räjapalnyo hy anekasah 16 viprädipräninah sarve sarvadosabhayärditäh yena vai smrtamätrena mucyante tad bravïmi te 13c matrïbhir corr. : mätribhi N : mäträdi Ed. : 13d dävyadämarikädibhih N : dävldämarikädibhih Ed. 14b anekasah Ed. : anekasaih N 14c raksagrahädibhyah N : raksograhädyais ca Ed. 15b jighämsitäh Ed. : jighämsatä N I shall tell you that [Mantra] by whose mere remembrance [the Guru] can free kings, their wives and children, and [indeed] all creatures begin ning with learned brahmins, if they have been dominated by any of the countless hordes of [possessing spirits:] Bhiltas, Yaksas, Unmädas, Sä kirns, YoginTs, Bhagims, Rudramätars, Davis, DämarTs, Rüpikäs, Ap asmäras, Pisäcas, Brahmaraksas, Grahas and the like, if they have been attacked by Apamrtyus, if they are in danger of falling victim to the snares of Death, or are suffering from the danger of any ill. from this point until the end 01 tne sixth 01 tne worK s twenty-two chapters we are told the Mantra, its worship, the ceremony of initia tion to that worship and then a number of procedures for its applica tion. The benefits specified are the restoring of physical vitality (pustih) (3.77), longevity (pürnam äyuh) (3.78), wealth (srTh) (3.78), rule (räj'yam) (3.79), good health (3.79), rescuing the dying from death (mrtyüttäranam) (6.9-1 lb), the warding off of all ills (,mahäsäntih) (6.1 le—13b) and the banishing of fevers (jvaranä,sah) (6.15cd). The last half of the sixth chapter sets out a procedure for the protection of the king (räjaraksävidhänam). A Yantra, that is to say a diagram on birch bark inscribed with the Mantra and the name of the beneficiary, is worshipped; a fire-sacrifice is performed; and</page><page sequence="17">SAIVA OFFICIANTS - THE KING'S BRAHMANICAL CHAPLAIN 245 the king is consecrated from a vase into which the Mantra has been infused. The ceremony is to destroy the pride of his enemies when he goes into battle, to free him from all illnesses, and to bestow on him the highest sovereignty.34 Chapters 7 and 8 outline subtler, meditational practices, but the context is unchanged, as it is in chapters 9 to 14, which teach that the Mantra is absolutely universal in its range and can therefore be used in conjunction with any deity and its retinue, not merely with Amrtesvara as visualized in the cult proper. So we are given the appropriate substitute deity-visualizations for the four main divi sions of the Saiva Mantramärga, namely the Siddhänta, the Väma, the Daksina and the Kaula, and then, beyond Saivism, for the cults of Visnu, the Sun, Siva in the lay context, Brahma, the Buddha, Skanda, Kama, the Moon, Ganesa, the Lokapälas, "and all other deities". The context, though mostly only implicit in this long sec tion, surfaces in the chapter on the Kaula modification. There we are told that the eight Mothers (who form the circuit of Amrtesvara in this case) must be worshipped with abundant offerings to bring about the warding off of ills (säntih), but with exceptional lavish ness when the beneficiary is the king, because it is by their favour that he will enjoy untroubled rule: 12.6 pahktisthä vâ yajed devïh sarväbhTstaphalapradäh sarvesäm caiva säntyarthampräninäm bhütim icchatä 7 bhüriyägena yastavyä yathäkamanurüpatah visesena tu yastavyä bhübhrtänäm tu daisikaih 8 äsäm eva prasädena räjyam nihatakantakam bhunjate sarvaräjänah subhagä hy avanTtale 6c sarvesäm caiva N : sarvesäm eva Ed. 7b yathäkämänurüpatah Ed. : yathäkarmänurüpatah N 7c visesena tu N : visesäd devi Ed. 7d bhü bhrtänäm tu N : bhübhrtäm api Ed.

[For] if a kingdom is free of enemies and fortunate kings enjoy [their sovereignty] on earth, it is by their favour.35 In the 15th chapter the text returns to the detail of protecting the royal household (räjaraksä), and this theme continues in the chapters that follow. The Yantra taught in the 17th will bestow victory on kings who are under attack from beyond their borders and should be used at all times to protect the king's wives, his sons, brahmins and others.36 Chapter 18 teaches the procedures for the worship of Sri (AmrtalaksmT) without her consort.

By her favour he is bound to win.37 The long 19th chapter details procedures for countering possession by various classes of being. Here the Guru's role is portrayed almost exclusively as that of priest to the royal family. He is told that he may use his knowledge to help his own family and pupils but other wise he is to do these rites only for the king, his queens and their children.

Since [Amrtcsvara] can take on any form at will [the officiant] should always worship him on any festal day.48 [In this way] he will secure all that he desires. After this general rule the text sets out how he is to proceed in a particular case. This is the royal festival of Indra's pole (indro tsavah, indradhvajotsavah) to be celebrated on the twelfth day of the bright fortnight of the month Bhädrapada (July/August). The procedures of the brahmanical prototype are described in the Kashmirian Visnudharmottara, Khanda 2, chapter 155.49 Ac cording to that account the rites start on the first day of the light fortnight of Bhädrapada. First the king worships Indra and his consort Sac! on Patas.50 Then the pole is prepared by felling an appropriate tree and fetched from the forest on a cart drawn by 48 I understand nimittam, literally 'an occasion requiring' [special worship], to refer here to all days that occasion a naimittikam karma in the sense of a calendrical ly fixed recurrent non-daily act of special worship (vis'esapüjä). Cf. Yäjnavalkyasmrti 1.203ab: dätavyam pratyaham patre nimittesu visesatah. That this is the sense is apparent from the specific occasions that exemplify this rule in the verses 19.102c ff. 49 For evidence that the Visnudharmottara originated in Kashmir or its neigh bourhood see the Appendix. 50 A Pata (Skt. patah) is a tanka (Tibetan than ka), a painting of a deity or deities on burnished cotton cloth to which several layers of a gesso have been applied; Pingalamata (f. 27v4-6 [5.2-5]): bhogamoksaprasiddhyartham patam kärpäsikam varam/*kes'ajädy anyathâ (conj. : kos'ajädyänyathä Cod.) devi viparïtâdisâdhane/pre tavasträdikam s'laksnam *sadas'am (corr.: sadasam Cod.) dvistriksälitam/khalitam pinditam mrdyam s'ahkhädyena sus'obhane/tintadibTja samgrhya susvinnam pisayed budhah /tasyordhvam kharparampistvä *caikTkrtvä (corr. : cekTkrtvä Cod.) tu marda yet/svacchodakena cälodya tena vastram pralepayet/ vajralepah smrto hy esa punah punah samäcaret.

On the eighth the king enters the city followed by the citizens carrying fruits and wearing their best clothes. The capi tal must be decorated with banners and flags, the royal highway sprinkled, and the children adorned. It must be full of actors and dancers, and its deities, both public and domestic, must be wor shipped to the accompaniment of loud music. The pole is placed on the ground prepared for it facing east, covered with fine cloths, and worshipped until the twelfth. On the eleventh the king has fasted and held a vigil with his chaplain, his astrologer, and all the citi zens. Dramatic spectacles must be staged all over the city during the night and the king must worship Indra with dance and song. On the twelfth he bathes his head and has the pole raised. He wor ships the pole and the Patas of Indra and SacT with various Balis and by means of the honouring of brahmins. The chaplain per forms a fire-sacrifice with the Mantras of Indra and Visnu and wor ships Indra with dance and song. The king honours brahmins with gifts of money, particularly his chaplain and astrologer. On the fifth day of the festival the pole is dismissed. After offering reverence to it in the presence of his army he has it born away by elephants and disposed of with the two Patas into a river. The citizens celebrate by playing in the water.51 Now the Netratantra tells us that on this occasion the Saiva offi ciant is to worship not Indra but Amrtesvara as Indra: prajänäm raksanärthäya salin am sasyasampade 19.103 sutapatnïsu raksärtham ätmano rästravrddhaye indrarüpam yajet tatra vijayärtham nrpasya ca 102d sasyasampade N : cäpi sampade Ed. 103c indrarüpam Ed. : indrarüpT N For the protection of the [king's] subjects, for abundant crops of rice [and other] grains, for the protection of his [king's] sons and wives, for the prosperity of the kingdom and the king's victory [in war] he should worship [Amrtesvara] on that [day]52 in the likeness of Indra {indrarüpam). 51 For detailed accounts of this festival see also (1) Brhatsamhita, Adhyaya 42, following Garga, and (2) Atharvavedaparis'ista 19a (indramahotsavah). In the sec ond Khanda of the Visnudharmottara Adhyäyas 154-157 are devoted to it. Adhyaya 154 is introductory. 155 covers the procedures. 156 deals with overcom ing the dire consequences for the king and citizens if the pole falls or is damaged in some way. Adhyaya 157 gives the text of the Mantra of Praise (stavamantrah) that the king must recite when the Indra pole is being raised. 52 Ksemaräja ad 103c: tatreti naimittike indradine.</page><page sequence="25">SAIVA OFFICIANTS - THE KING'S BRAHMANICAL CHAPLAIN 253 Since the text has just stated that Amrtesvara can take on any form I infer a rule that on all calendrical occasions on which the worship of a certain deity was required, the Saiva officiant was to worship Amrtes vara (and/or AmrtalaksmT) as that deity. This is certainly how Kse maraja understands the matter. He explains that when the text says in 19.102a that Amrtesvara is able to take on any form at will (käma rüpam in his version) it means that he "assumes the form of whichever is the deity of the special occasion in question (tattannaimitti kadevatäkäramy\ In other words the officiant's cult is always that of Amrtesvara (and/or AmrtalaksmT), unchanging in its essence, since that resides in the Mantras, but it can be inflected to take on the form of any other cult as required, by substituting the form and other exter nals of the appropriate deity with or without his or her consort.53 I propose that this inference provides the key to understanding why the text did not restrict itself to the icons of Amrtesvara and Amrta laksmT but after setting out the cult of Amrtesvara in chapters 2 to 8 devoted chapters 9 to 13 to his visualization first as the deities of the four specific Saiva divisions (Siddhänta, Väma, Daksitja and Kaula) and then, in chapter 13, as the principal deities beyond the boundaries of the Mantramärga, including the non-Ägamic, lay forms of Siva him self.54 For these deities outside the five Saiva systems of the text (the four and the uninfected cult of Amrtesvara) are evidently those of brahmanical calendrical worship, among whom Siva himself is num bered. I therefore interpret the absolute universality of Amrtesvara, 53 I propose that if the deity were male then Amrtesvara alone would be in voked; if female, then AmrtalaksmT; and if accompanied by a female consort, as in the case of Indra and SacI in the Indra festival of the Visnudharmottara, then Amrtesvara and AmrtalaksmT. Evidence that AmrtalaksmT was invoked when the worship of a goddess was required will be presented in due course in the case of the worship of the royal sword. 54 These are the four-armed form of Siva (13.29-30) cited in the Appendix as relevant to the date of the text, the multi-armed dancing form ( = Nrtyarudra, Nrtyesvara, etc.) (nätyastham 19.31ab), ArdhanärTsvara/GaurTsvara (umärdha dhärinam 19.31c), Harihara (visnu-r-evärdhadhärinam 19.3Id), Siva and PärvatT at their wedding (vivahastham) 19.32a) (19.32a), and Siva and PärvatT side by side (?) {samïpastham 18.32b, = Umamahesvara?).

For the Kashmirian Ädipuräna-Tithikrtya requires the king to offer worship, that is to say, to have worship performed by his chaplain, for the whole range of brahmanical deities on the days in the lunar month that are sacred to them.57 It might be urged against this interpretation that the Netratantra includes the Buddha among the forms that may be assumed by Amrtesvara. For the Buddha is evidently not a brahmanical deity. That objection might hold for other areas of the Indian world but not for Kashmir. For in its account of the local religious calendar the Kashmirian NTlamatapuräna requires the worship of the Bud dha in celebration of the days of his birth and Nirvana during the 3 days of the moon's passing from Pusya to Maghä in the bright half of Vaisäkha.58 Moreover, the Netratantra refers to the Buddha at the end of its description of his iconic form as "bestowing the reward of liberation upon women".59 This suggests that the wor ship of [Amrtesvara as] the Buddha was a duty that the Saiva offi ciant was required to perform for the special benefit of the women of the palace. Patronage of Buddhism in Kashmir was not provided by royal women alone, but in the political history of the kingdom completed by the poet-historian Kalhapa in ad 1148/9 they do figure conspicuously in this role in his account of events immedi ately before and during the Kärkota dynasty (c. 626^855/6), the 55 Netra 9.17 b: * sarvasädhärano hy es a (N : sarväs tä + + + + hy esa Ed.); 13.44: sarvasädhärano devah sarvasiddhiphalapradah/sarvesäm eva *varnänäm (N : mantränäm Ed.) ßvabhüto yatah smrtah; 13.46ab: vikalpo naiva kartavyah sarva sädhärano yatah; 14.8ab: sädhärano mantranäthah sarvesäm eva väcakah; 16.23c 24: dvaitädvaitavimisre väplsto vai siddhido bhavet/yasmät sarvagato devah visvarüpo manir yathä/sädhakasyecchayä cestah siddhido bhavati dhruvam; and 19.82cd: sarva tantresu sämänyo mrtyujit prakatjkrtah. 56 See, e.g., Ksemaräja ad 6.8cd {param sarvätmakam caiva moksadam mrtyu jid bhavet): mahäsämänyamantravTryarüpatvän mrtyujinnäthasyettham nirdesah. sa rvätmakam paramädvayam. 57 Ädipuräna-Tithikrtya 11. 2828-2843. 58 NTlamata 689-695. 59 Netra 13.36cd: *dhyätvä hy evam prapüjyeta (N : evam dhyätah püjitas ca Ed.) stnnäm moksaphalapradah 'He who bestows the reward of liberation on women should be visualized in this way and then worshipped'.</page><page sequence="27">SAIVA OFFICIANTS - THE KING'S BRAHMANICAL CHAPLAIN 255 period towards whose end I hold the Netratantra to have been composed.60 Immediately after instructing the officiant to worship Amrtesvara as Indra on the occasion of the pole festival the Netratantra goes on to rule that on the Great Ninth (MahänavamI), the ninth day of the bright half of the next month, Äsvayuja (August/September), he should make lavish offerings to the deity and worship the king's weapons: 19.104 gosu brähmanaraksärtham ätmanah svajanesu ca mahänavamyäm püjyeta bhüriyägena vesmani 105 pürvoktasreyam äpnoti äyurärogyasampadah astrayägam prayatnena kartavyam siddhihetutah 106 astrasiddhim aväpnoti prayoktä phalam asnute 104a gosu brähmana conj. : gobhübrähmana N : gobrähmanesu Ed.61 105a pürvoktasreyam äpnoti N : pürvoktam samaväpnoti Ed. 105b sampadah N : sampadam Ed. 105cd astrayägam prayatnena kartavyam siddhihetutah N : astrayägah prakartavyah prayatnät siddhihetave Ed. 106b prayoktä Ed. : prayuktä N On the Great Ninth he should worship [Amrtesvara] with lavish offer ings in his home for the protection of cows, the land, brahmins, himself and his household.

Amrta prabha, wife of Ranäditya-Tunjma III (probably in the late sixth century), installed a Buddha statue in a monastery built by Bhinnä, another of Meghavähana's wives (3.464). Anangalekhä, wife of Durlabhavardhana (r. c. 626-662), founded the monas tery Anangabhavana (4.3) and PrakasadevI, wife of Candräpida (r. c. 712-720/1), the monastery Prakäsikävihära (4.79). Support for Buddhism within Kashmirian royalty appears from the Rajataranginï to have reached its highest point during the reign of Lalitäditya (c. 725-761/2). The king himself, though personally a Bhägavata, founded several Buddhist monasteries and Stüpas and installed Bud dha images (4.188, 4.200, 4.203-04, 4.210), as did his Central-Asian chief minister Cankuna (Chin, jiangjun 'General') (4.211, 4.215, 4.262). There is no evidence of royal support for Buddhism after this reign in the Rajataranginï. It records no Buddhist foundations or installations for the period of the Utpala dynasty (855/ 6-980/1) and thereafter only one, the construction of a monastery by Bhadre svara, the chief minister of Samgrämaräja (r. 1003-1028) (7.121). 61 The conjecture gives an irregular syntax; but it is one seen repeatedly in the Nepalese manuscript of this text, and it agrees with the sense of Ed.'s reading.

He should perform the ceremony of wor shipping the weapons [on that day62] with special care in order to bring about Siddhi. He will indeed accomplish their Siddhi, and he who com missions [the ceremony] will achieve [victory in battle as his] reward. Ksemaräja interprets the attaining of the Siddhi of the weapons to be their transformation into weapons with celestial power (divyäni) and the person who commissions the ceremony to be "the king or the like" (räjädih). "The like", I propose, are others with troops under their command, such as provincial governors (mandalesah).63 Since the purpose of the ritual is that they should be victorious in battle, the weapons can only be theirs. The deity of this autumnal festival, which marked the beginning of the season of military campaigns and did indeed include a ceremony in which the royal weapons and insignia were worshipped, is the martial goddess Bhadrakäll. According to the Visn udharmottaras account of this festival64 the king should have a pavilion for the worship of Bha drakäll (bhadrakälTgrham) constructed on the northeast side of his cap ital. He should worship her there on a painted Pata on the ninth day of the bright half of the month after worshipping the weapons, armour, parasol, banner and all the other royal insignia (räjalingäni) on the previous day.65 The NTlamatapuränci tells us that the weapons are to be worshipped in a shrine of Durgä during the preceding night.66 No doubt when Amrtesvara was made to take on this form, or indeed that of any other goddess in the calendar, he did so in his 62 Ksemaräja ad 105cd: mahänavamyäm eva. 63 Ksemaräja ad 106ab: divyäny asträni mantraprabhävät sampädayati. räjädis ca vijayam äpnotTty äha. prayoktä pürvoktayäjayitä 'Through the power of the Mantra [of Amrtesvara] he makes the weapons celestial.

"He who commissions" is the person who has the aforesaid sacrifice performed'. 64 Visnudharmottara 2.158.1-8. 65 Visnudharmottara 2.158.4: tatraiväyudhavarmädyam chattram ketumca püjayet/ räjalingäni sarväni tathästräni ca püjayet.

This practice of worshipping the royal weapons and other insignia during the Navarätra festival was not restricted to Kashmir. See, e.g., Sivapriyananda (1995), plates 55-58, 91-92, and 96 for photographs of the royal swords, the royal crown and fly-whisk installed for worship beside the image of Cämundesvarl, the lineage goddess of the Maharajas of Mysore, in their royal pal ace during the Navarätra festival that culminates on this ninth; and Tod (1920, p. 683) for the worship of the royal sword, shield and spear on MahänavamT in the royal palace in Udaipur.</page><page sequence="29">SAIVA OFFICIANTS - THE KING'S BRAHMANICAL CHAPLAIN 257 female aspect, through his consort AmrtalaksmT. This would have prevented an awkward clash of genders. But it is suggested indepen dently by the ruling seen above that it is AmrtalaksmT that is to be worshipped in the king's sword. For the underlying identity of the deity of that weapon is indeed BhadrakälT. The worship of Bhad rakäll on the king's sword before he goes to war is treated at some length in a text attributed to the Ähgirasakalpa of the Atharvavedins' ancillary literature and included in the Orissan Paippalädavasädi satkarmapaddhati, a work that sets out a large number of rites that should or may be performed by chaplains for their royal patrons.67 That the Netratantra should mention only these two calendrical ceremonies, the Indra festival and the worship of the royal weapons [and BhadrakälT] on the Great Ninth (MahänavamT), is in keeping with the proposition that the officiant in this text is one who is working in the territory of the king's personal chaplain, since these two are the principal festivals that engage the king. That can be seen from the fact that in the detailed account of the king's ritual obliga tions in the Visnudharmottara they are the only calendrically fixed annual ceremonies with a marked civic dimension apart from the Vaisnava festivals that mark the four months of Visnu's sleep.68 After prescribing the worship of BhadrakälT and the royal weapons and insignia on the Great Ninth the Visnudharmottara goes on to 67 See Paippaladavasadisatkarmapaddhati pp. 105-113. I am very grateful to Dr. Arlo Griffiths of the University of Groningen for sending me first a copy of this publication, of which, according to its Sanskrit title page, he was the promoter (protsahakah), and then an electronic text of the same. 68 The Visnudharmottara briefly lists the king's periodic ritual duties (nityakarma) in 2.152.1-7. They are (1) a monthly ritual bath when the moon is in the asterism under which he was born ( janmanaksatrasnanam) and (2) another when it is in the asterism Pusya (pusyasnânam), (3) worship of Sürya (the Sun) and Candra (the Moon) on the days on which the sun moves from one zodiacal sign into the next, (4) the wor ship of a planet (Graha) when it has been eclipsed by the Sun, (5) worship to be offered on the day of the heliacal rising of the star Agastya (Canopus) (agastyapüjä), (6) the worship of Visnu during the 4 months mentioned, (7) an annual Ghrtakambala Kotihoma, a fire-sacrifice requiring a number of priests working simultaneously over many days to make 10 million oblations timed to end at the end of the 4 months of Visnu's sleep followed by a ritual in which the king is covered with a blanket (kamba lam) and then first has melted butter (ghrtam) poured over him from eight, twenty eight or one hundred and eight vases, and then, after the blanket has been removed, is bathed with consecrated water, (8) a ritual for Rudra (rudrapüjä) at the end of each regnal year, and (9-10) the celebration of these two public festivals. Chapters 153-158 then cover the major topics in detail.

The section requires that the weapons be worshipped in the temple of Durgä during the night of the eighth and that the lustra tion take place on the next day according to the procedure of the Atha rvaveda, that is to say, the Veda of the king's personal chaplain. The lustration of the king's horses and elephants is indeed scheduled for this day in the section on the annual royal ceremonies to be performed by the king's domestic chaplain in the Alharvavedaparisista.70 In the Netratantra too a lustration ceremony is taken up immedi ately after its treatment of the rites of the Great Ninth, though here it is a lustration of the king himself. Moreover there is no statement that it is to be performed during the autumnal festival. The only ex plicit instruction is that it is to be adopted when there is some ill to ward off such as a life-threatening illness of the king or other mem ber of the royal family:71 yadä mrtyuvasäghrätah kälena kalito nrpah 19.107 aristacihnitätmäno desam vä tatsutädayah brähmanädisu sarvesu paurajanapadesu ca 69 This is taught in Visnudharmottara 2.159.1-47 and the ascribed benefits are declared there in 46-47: säntir mräjanäkhyeyam kartavyä vasudhädhipaih/ksemyä vrddhikarï räma narakunjaraväjinäm / 47 dhanyä yasasyä ripunäs'anT ca sukhävahä säntir anuttamä ca/käryä nrpai rästravivrddhihetoh sarvaprayatnena bhrgupravTra. 70 Atharvavedaparisista 17.1.1-8, 18.1.1-18.3.12, and 18b.2.1-9 (18b.2.1: mahäna vamyäm hastyasvadTksä 'the lustration of the [king's] elephants and horses is on the Great Ninth'). The 6th-century Brhatsamhitä of Varähamihira says in the chapter devoted to this ceremony (mräjanasäntih) that it should take place on the twelth, eighth or fifteenth day of the bright half of Kärtika or, as here, during [the bright half of| Äsvayuja (43.2). Käthakagrhyasütra 57.1 rules that one should honour horses and all transports on the full moon day of Äsvayuja: äsvayujyäm asvän mahayanti sarväni ca vähanäni] and Ädityadarsana ad loc. explains 'all trans ports' as as elephants, mules, buffaloes, camels and the like': sarväni ca vähanäni. hastyasvataramahisakharostradïni ca. 71 We see a lustration prescribed both on the ninth of Äsvayuja and as a special rite to be performed when the need arises in Arthasastra 2.30.51: mräjanäm äsvayuje kärayen navame 'hani/yälrädäv avasäne vä vyädhau vä säntike ratah 'Devoted to rites for the warding off of ills [the superintendent of the king's horses] should have a lustration ceremony performed [by the Purohita not only] on the 9th day of Äsva yuja, [but also] at the beginning or end of a military expedition or in time of sickness'.</page><page sequence="31">SAIVA OFFICIANTS - THE KING'S BRAHMANICAL CHAPLAIN 259 108 s'älyädisu ca sasyesu phalamülodakena ca durbhiksavyädhikäryesu utpätais cäpy anutlamaih 109 tadä nairäjanam käryam räjnäm rästrasya vrddhaye pürvavad yajanam krtvä kalasenäbhisincayet 110 nihsankam nirjane rätrau subharkse ca tathämsake jayapunyäliasabdena vedamahgalasvastikaih 111 abhisinceta räjänam siddhärthän juhuyäd bahün nairajanavidhänena nämänkam juhuyät priye 112 vahnau samkruddhamanasä ajäms ca proksayed bahün trptyartham bhütasanghasya mantrT raksärtham udyatah 113 sakunoktyämsagatyä va vijnäya sakunam hitam yaksendrasivavärunyäm niryätah sarvasiddhidah 114 atha pürvoktavidhinä grhe yägam tu kärayet yävat saptähnikam devi bhürihomena siddhidam 115 tasyäcalä mahälaksmT räjyam va y ad abhîpsitam bhaumäntariksasiddhmi präpnuyän nrpatih sukhT 116 tadä nairäjanam khyätam sarvasreyaskaram param pürvoktam nasyate dosam devi nästy atra samsayah 106d kalito nrpah Ed. : kalitam nrpam N 107a aristacihnitätmäno conj. : aristacihnitadana N : aristacihnitätmä vai Ed. 107b des'am N : deso Ed. 107d paurajanapadesu ca N : näse janapadasya ca Ed. 108a sälyädisu ca sasyesu Ed. : sälicürnädisasyesu N 108b phalamülodakena N : phalamü lodakesu Ed. 108d utpätais cäpy anuttamaih N : utpätesu mahatsu ca Ed. 109a nairajanam N : nïrajanam Ed. 109b räjnäm N (cf. 19.129b): räjno Ed. • râstrasya vrddhaye N : rästravivrddhaye Ed. 109d kalasenâbhisimcayet N : kalasenäbhisecayet Ed. 110a nihsarrkam N : nihsanko Ed. 110b su bharkse ca tathämsake Ed. : subham etat tu daisikah N 110c sabdena N : sabdais ca Ed. llOd svastikaih N : nihsvanaih Ed. 111a abhisinceta conj. : abhisimcata N : abhisincet tu Ed. 111c nairäjana N : mräjana Ed. 11 Id nämämkam juhuyät pryeN (= 15.8ab) : nämänke samskrtepriye Ed. 112a samkruddhamanasä corr.

After worshipping as before he should do an Abhiseka [by sprinkling with water] from the [consecrated] vase. When the asterism and degree are auspicious he should give this Abhiseka to the king in an isolated place to the accompaniment of cries of "Victory!", "Meritori ous Day!",73 auspicious [chanting of] the Vedas, and [the eulogies of] bards.74 He should [then] offer into the fire a large quantity of mustard seeds.75 Beloved, he should offer them into the sacrificial fire with the pro cedure of lustration, indicating the beneficiary's name,76 with angry mind. The officiant, determined to accomplish this protection, should [then] asper ge [and sacrifice] numerous goats to gratify the hostile spirits and the horde [of Mothers, Yoginls and the rest77]- If when he has determined the auspi cious moment following the instruction of the [royal] astrologer or by cal culating the degree [of the zodiac] the officiant goes out [of the capital accompanied by the king78] to the north, the northeast, or the west, he will bestow all supernatural benefits [on him]. Then, O Goddess, fol lowing the procedure taught above he should perform the Siddhi 73 The text refers here to the brahmanical practice of punyähaväcanam, the uttering of the word punyäham 'meritorious day' thrice at the beginning of any rite to promote its success (mahgalam). 74 For these auspicious, apotropaic accompaniments at the time of Abhiseka cf., e.g., Brhatsamhitä 47.49 concerning the king's Pusyasnäna: vandijanapauravipra praghustapunyähavedanirghosaih/samrdahgasankhatüryair mahgalasabdair hatanis tah; and NTlamata 824 concerning the brahmanical consecration of the king: snänakäle ca kartavyam mahat kalakalam tathä/väditrasankhapunyähasütavandijanaih saha. The same applies in the Abhiseka of an initiate; see, e.g., Bhojadeva, Siddhäntasärapaddhati f. 34r4-v2: bhadräsanam vinyasya tasmin sisyam vinyasya hnkhatüryavmävenusvasti punyähavedadhvanibhih krtamahgalam ... abhisecayet. 75 Mustard seeds, also called sarsapah and raksoghnah, are believed to have the power to fend off evil. See Netra 15.7-11. 76 Ksemaraja ad loc.: amukasya niräjanam astu svähä ity atra prayogah 'The for mulation here is "May there be lustration of '[name]', SVÄHÄ" '. For '[name]' (amu ka-) the officiant is to substitute the name of the king and, of course, to precede this formulation with the Base-Mantra (mülamantrah) of Amrtesvara. The expletive SVÄHÄ is the closure ( jatih) required when making a regular oblation into the fire, taking the place of the NAMAH at the end of other offerings. Thus for King Sanka ravarman, for example, the Mantra to be uttered with each oblation would be: OM JUM SAH SRÏSANKARAVARMANO NlRÄJANAM ASTU SVÄHÄ. 77 The most natural understanding of the expression bhütasahghah is as a Tatpu rusa meaning 'the horde of hostile spirits'. Ksemaräja, however, no doubt with rit ual procedure in mind, takes it as a singular Dvanda meaning 'hostile spirits and the horde' specifying the latter as that of the Mothers, Yoginls and others (,bhütäni ca samghas Ceti samäsah. samgho mätryoginyädiganah). 78 That the officiant goes out with the king is a detail added by Ksemaraja ad loc.: vijayäbhimukhena räjnä saha niryätah 'gone forth with the king intent on vic tory'. The sense is that the king and his chaplain enact the king's matching forth to war after lustration.</page><page sequence="33">SAIVA OFFICIANTS - THE KING'S BRAHMANICAL CHAPLAIN 261 bestowing ritual of [Amrtesvara's] worship in the [Sänti] temple79 for seven days, together with lavish offerings into the sacrificial fire. He [for whom this sacrifice is performed80] will achieve permanent great wealth, sovereignty or whatever else he may desire. The king will be contented and attain the Siddhis of both earth and sky.81 Then, O Goddess, it is said that he has received the highest lustra tion, that which bestows all benefits. The aforesaid evils cease to exist. Of this, O Goddess, there is no doubt. There is no reference here to the lustration of the king's soldiers, horses and elephants, as there is in the Visnudharmottara, but the Netratantra follows its lustration of the king with instruction in the means by which the Saiva officiant should protect the king's cattle, horses, elephants, goats and other livestock: 19.117 gosu madhye yajed yasmät sadâ vardhati gokulam sindüram gairikam väpi abhimantreta mantravit 118 yoktavyam gosu raksartham s'rngordhve sarvadosajit asvanäm raksanärthäya pürvoktavidhinä yajet 79 The Netra says only that the ritual should take place grhe 'in the house' or 'in the temple'. Ksemaräja understands this to mean räjiio grhe, i.e., 'in the royal palace'. I conjecture that the unspecified grham is the temple known as the s'äntigrham, the temple for the performance of Sinti rituals to protect the king and the kingdom. This does not necessarily contradict Ksemaräja's opinion, which might be expected to be well-informed on such a point. For according to the Saiva Pratisthätantras this temple could be built in the northeast quarter of the royal palace or of the residence of [his] Saiva Guru. See Mayasamgraha f. 33v (5.188abc): atha bhübhrnniväso 'tra kuryâd vedhasi tad grham aisanye säntigrham; Pihgalämata f. 74v4 (10.151 ab) (concerning the cumbakagrham 'the residence of the Guru'): bähye nyäsam punar devi tatrese santikam grham. 80 This is Ksemaräja's interpretation ad loc.: yadartham caivam ijyate "asyäcalä mahâlaksmï ...". 81 The same language is used in 18.79 to describe the benefits that accrue to someone who has received Abhiseka from a vase of water in which [Amrta] laksml has been installed and worshipped, except that to Siddhis of earth and sky that passage adds those of heaven: tasyäcalä mahâlaksmï räjyam va yad abhïpsitam/bhaumântariksa *siddhïni (N : siddhim ca Ed.) divyäm *caivaisvarïm (Ed. : caivesvarï N) s'ubhäm. I have not encounted the notion of the Siddhis of these realms elsewhere in the literature and Ksemaräja offers no explanation on either of its two occurrences in this text. Elsewhere the adjectives bhaumah, ântariksah/antariksagah and divyah occur together with reference to phenomena that portend calamities (utpätäh) (e.g. Atharvavedaparis'ista 2.2.3: divyaniariksa bhaumänäm utpätänäm; Brhatsamhitä 47.53ab) or to hostile spirits (e.g. Svacchanda 3.20). The sense is probably that the king gains power over these phenomena in the sense that he is immunized against their influence.</page><page sequence="34">262 ALEXIS SANDERSON 119 abhimantreta kalasam siras tesäm pradäpayet siddhärthakam japitvä tu kanthe käryam tu mïtrdhani 120 sarvadosavinirmuktän gajäms caiva tu raksati ajesu pasavesv evam raksäm sarvatra kärayet 121 sarvapränisu raksärtham yoktavyam nrpateh sadä mahäsäntir bhavet tesäm durbhiksam nasyate sadä 117b vardhati N : vardheta Ed. 117c gairikam Ed. : gaurikam N 117d abhimantreta N : abhimantryaiva Ed. 118a yoktavyam N : yojayed Ed. 118c asvänäm raksanärthäya N : asvänäm api raksärtham Ed. 119a abhi mantreta N : abhimantryaiva Ed. 119b siras tesäm pradäpayet N : mürdhni tesämprapätaye Ed. 119c siddhärthakam japitvä tu N : si ddhärtho mantrajaptas tu Ed. 119d käryam tu N : käryo 'tha Ed. 120b caiva tu N : caiva ca Ed. 120c ajesu pasavesv evam conj.

The officiant should worship [Amrtesvara] in the midst of the [king's] cows, since [by this means] his herd will constantly increase. He should empower vermilion powder or red chalk with the Mantra and apply it to the tips of their horns to protect them, for it will overcome all evils. To protect the [king's] horses he should offer the cult in the manner stated above, empower with the Mantra a vase [filled with water] and pour it[s contents] on their heads. He should empower mustard seeds by repeating the Mantra over them and then place them on their necks and heads.

They will benefit from a general warding off of ills (mahäs'äntih). Famine will cease forever. The Netratantra also requires its Saiva officiant to perform the wor ship of Amrtesvara as a Sänti ritual whenever the realm (mandalam) is affected by an earthquake, the falling of a meteor (iulkäpätah), a drought, excessive rains, a swarm of mice or other pests, phenomena such as the untimely appearance of flowers, the destruction or splitting of an image of a god, fevers, [illnesses 82 I follow Ksemaraja in taking these mustard seeds (siddhartho mantritah ) to be the subject here. 83 I take the causative karayet here in the non-causative sense, a licence com monly seen in such scriptural texts.

Alternatively it may be made with cowdung or blades of Kusa grass.87 He should purify it with a bath. He should then perform the ceremony of initiation upon it.88 By [meditating on himself as Siva] pervading [the universe] (vyäptyä) he should bring back the soul [of the deceased from] wherever 87 The option that the simulacrum should be made of silver is that of a reading räjatä rejected by Ksemaräja. I have retained it because it is supported by N (rajata). Ksemaräja explains his preferred reading rajasä 'with powder' as meaning 'with rice-flour' (sälicürnena), but that is not supported by other accounts of this ritual. In his treatment Abhinavagupta gives an open list of materials that may be used to make these simulacra, mentioning cow-dung, blades of Kusa/Darbha grass (Poa cynosuroides), fruit (Tanträloka 21.22d-23a, 33, 35, 40, 43) and 'such things as the nutmeg (Myristica fragrans)' (21.36ab: jätiphalädi yad kimcit tena vä dehakalpanâ). The Kashmirian Brhatkälottara, borrowing from the Päncarätrika Jayäkhyasamhitä, matches the Netra in saying that the simulacrum should be twelve Arigulas in length, but differs in saying that it should be made with all its limbs by shaping it out of white earth mixed with the five products of the cow and water, or out of the wood of the trees Paläsa (Butea frondosa) or Asvattha (Ficus religiosa), or with a spray of flowers (pallavah) (B f. 195v4-5): tatah svetamrdälodya pancagavyena cämbhasä/dvädasähgulamätram tu mürttim kuryät *tadäkrtim (em. : tadäkrttim Cod.)/äpäda*cülikäntam (corr. : cülikätam Cod.) ca *sarvähgävaya vänvitäm (em. : sarvävayavänvitam Cod,)/paläsäsvatthajenaiva därunä *pallavena (em. : canavena Cod.) vä. The Nepalese manuscript of the Jayäkhyasamhitä adds a third wood as an option, but the reading is evidently corrupt: *tatah (em. : tatada ta Cod.) svetamrdälodya pancagavyena cämbhasä/dvädasähgulamätnm tu mürttim *kuryät (corr. : kuryä Cod.) tadäkrtim/äpädäc cülikäntäh ca sarvvähgävayavä nvitäm/*paläsäsvattha\därbh\otthadärunä (conj. : paläsosvatthadärbhotthädärunä Cod.) *pallavena (em. : pavaluvena) vä (f. 81 r3—4). The Jayäkhyasamhitä published on the basis of south-Indian manuscripts makes this third wood that of the birch {Baetula bhojapatra) (24.86cd): paläsäsvathavalkotthadärunä). In the same tradition is the simulacrum made of Ficus leaves and flowers known as a puspalihga that is animated with the soul of the deceased by the Saiva officiant in the Balinese postcre mation ritual of the purification of the soul (mukur, nyekah, neles, etc.); see Hobart et al. (1996, pp. 125-6); and Stuart-Fox (2002, pp. 92-3); also the yogic ensouling of the 'flower-body' (puspasarTra) in the Saiva-Bauddha postcremation rites of the Javanese queen of Majapahit described in the Old Javanese Desawarnana (64.5, 67.2 [Robson, 1995, pp. 71 and 74]). 88 Literally 'initiation alone' (diksaiva). Ksemaräja takes the point of the restric tive particle eva to be that in this case there is no need for the preliminary rites known as adhiväsah that normally take place during the day before the initiation proper.</page><page sequence="38">266 ALEXIS SANDERSON it may be and place it in that [simulacrum]. As he makes the Full Oblation [after completing the oblations that eliminate the possibility of reincarnation on any level of the universe] he should cast [the simula crum] into the fire while [raising the soul through his own central energy-channel and then] uniting it with the level of Siva. By this means 89 Neither the reading of N (yatra samam nayet) nor that of Ed. (yavastham änayet) makes good sense. N's reading might be a corruption of yatra samam na yet, confusion of the graphs sa and sa occurring so pervasively in manuscripts copied by Newar scribes that it is arduous to record it. We could then take this and the next quarter verse to mean 'he should place (yojayet) the soul [of the deceased] (anum) into that (tatra) into which (yatra) he should bring it to rest (samam nayet)', understanding the site of the placing to be the reality-level to which the soul is to be raised through initiation and bringing it to rest to mean causing it to be one with that level. But at least two problems obtrude. The first is that the phrase samam nayet, though common, always denotes elimination (as of diseases or poison in the medical literature) or dissolution, as when a Yogin medi tates on a lower reality-level being withdrawn into the one above it; see, e.g., Jayäkhyasamhitä 16.263d (ksmäkhyam tattvam samam nayet) and LaksmTtantra 35.8d and 53.7b (ahamkäre samam nayet), and 53.8b (mülävyakte s'amam nayet). This is not the natural idiom for the uniting of the soul with a reality-level. The second problem is that the interpretation leads to pleonasm: the action of fusing the soul will be mentioned again in 118c and as fusion with the reality-level of Siva (yojanya sivatattve tu). I turn therefore to the reading yavastham änayet in Ed. This I propose is an error, probably of the compositor of the Devanägarl edition rather than the Kashmirian scribes, for yatrastham änayet, tra and va being graphs that are more readily confused in Devanägari than in Säradä. That Ksemaraja had this in his text of the Netra is not certain, since he does not gloss it directly, confirming only änayet with aniya in his introduction to the next quarter verse. But I propose that he does so indirectly in the eleven-line citation from the Hamsapäramesvara that he gives in his comment on vyäptyä. For that describes the Great Net pro cedure (mahäjälaprayogah) by means of which the officiant is to catch the soul of the deceased in whatever other state of incarnation it resides and place it in the heart [of the simulacrum] uttering the seed-syllable [of Mäyä (HRlM)] and the soul's name: yatra srotäntare sthitam/grhitvä tat prayogena mahäjälena yuktitah/grhTtam *hrdaye (em. : hrdayam Ed.) sthäpyam bTjäbhikhyäsamanvitam. I propose that for Ksemaräja the point of this part of citation was that it clarified the meaning of yatrastham in the Netra. The yogic procedure for catching the soul through visualization and the recita tion of the seed-syllable HRÎM (mäyäbtjam) is described by Abhinavagupta in Tanträloka 21.25-26 and by the passage cited from the Hamsapäramesvara. The officiant is to meditate on himself as Siva pervading the universe, exhale, inhale, hold his breath, raise the vital power through the central channel to the point twelve finger-breadths above his head, and then visualize this power moving out through all the worlds to find the soul. He should utter the syllable hrIm and take hold of that soul, visualizing it as resembling a drop of water.</page><page sequence="39">SAIVA OFFICIANTS - THE KING'S BRAHMANICAL CHAPLAIN 267 it will attain union [with Siva].90 He should [also] worship Siva [for the deceased] in the Sräddha ceremonies. Optionally he may do this wor ship during the cremation ceremony itself. [In the latter case], O god dess, the Guru should install an image of the frightening [Bhairava] form taught above91 attended by two Saktis92 in the cremation ground where the body was burned, employing the various offerings already mentioned and the aforesaid rites. Alternatively, O goddess, there may be four or eight [attendant Saktis] contemplated with the visualizations already taught.93 90 This kind of Saiva initiation was a conspicuous feature of Kashmirian life if we may judge from satirical references to its practice in the eleventh-century works of Ksemendra (Desopadesa 8.50: mrtakoddhäre; Narmamälä 3.43: mrtoddhära dîksa). Moreover, it may have been distinctive of that region. For the only prescrip tions of the practice known to me from Saiva sources other than the Netra and Tanträloka are also Kashmirian: (1) Satka 3 of the Jayadrathayämala (f. 156rl—v6 in the Catuscatvärimsatidiksäpatala in the Ghoraghorataräcakra)—its second and third lines have been cited in this context without attribution by Jayaratha ad Tanträloka 21.6—9b — and (2) the Antestimrtoddhärapatala of the Brhatkälottara (B ff. 195r3—197r 1, a section of that eclectic text borrowed with superficial adjust ments from the Päncarätrika Jayäkhyasamhitä24.16-I05b. Commenting on this passage of the Netra Ksemaräja refers to a non-Yogic alter native method for catching the soul of the deceased. A circular diagram is drawn with OM (nädah) at the centre and the syllables of the syllabary drawn in six cir cuits around it. The Sivanirvdnavidhi, which gives the text of the Saiva cremation ritual followed in Kashmir, illustrates this diagram and gives the full ritual proce dure, Mantras, and deities. The last are Mäyädevl, who is to be worshipped in a dish full of offerings placed on a lamp that rests at the centre of the diagram on top of OM HAM SAH followed by the name of the soul to be drawn in, and the eight Ksetrapälas, who are to be worshipped around the periphery (pp. 242-246). 91 The reference is to the five-faced, ten-armed black Bhairava taught in 10.1—6b as the form assumed by Amrtesvara in the Daksina division. See also Tanträloka 26.7-8, commenting on such public installations. 92 According to Ksemaräja ad loc. the two Saktis of the Bhairava to be installed at the place of cremation are 'the full-bodied and the emaciated' (saktidvayam krsasthülam). These, I propose, are the last two of the eight Mothers, Cämundä and YogesvarT, since they are so described in the Kashmirian Brhatkälottara A f. 251 r2: atipürnnä tu cämundä khadgakädyasamudyatä/savärüdhänrtyamänä savasrag dämamanditä/suskä yogesvarï käryä; and f. 251 r3—4: evamvidhä tu yogesT sirälä vikrtänanä. 93 The four are Siddhä, Raktä, Suskä and Utpalahastä, and the eight are these together with their four companions (DütTs): Kall, Karäll, Mahäkäll and Bha drakäll. Their visualizations are given in Netra 10.17—37a.</page><page sequence="40">268 ALEXIS SANDERSON The Netratantra, then, has shown us Saiva officiants active in almost all the areas of observance assigned by the Atharvavedic tradition to the brahmanical royal chaplain: rituals for the protection of the king, from rites attending his bathing, eating, exercise and sleep to daily and periodic sacrifices, rituals for his invigoration and victory, rituals of regular worship on the king's behalf, including the great public ceremonies of the Indra and BhadrakälT festivals, and rituals for the king's benefit after his death. Only the incidental function of performing reparatory rites (präyascittTyam karma) receives no atten tion here.94 Nor is the text backward in urging that the officiant's services should be lavishly rewarded.

My beloved, if one honours him, then for that alone all [the Mantra-deities] will certainly bestow the success of the Siddhi [one desires]. This is the truth. There is no doubt. Otherwise the Siddhi will be lost and one's effort will be in vain. and in the 19th chapter, after the passage cited above (19.139 134b) in which we are told that the permanent residence of such an officiant in a kingdom will render it immune to all conceivable calamities: sa püjyah sarvajantünäm bhüpatmäm ca sarvadä 19.135 dänapüjanasammänair asamaih püjyate yadi tena püjitamätrena sarve manträs ca püjitäh 136 bhavanti sukhadäs tatra All men should honour that [officiant], and kings should do so con stantly. When they have honoured him with unparallelled gifts, dem onstrations of respect, and marks of distinction, then by this alone they will have honoured all the Mantra[-deities], who will reward them with hanpiness in that frealml. All this is very much in the style that had been adopted in the brah manical context to promote the interests of the king's personal chaplain, as can readily be seen from the following passage of Atharvavedaparisista 4: 4.6.1 yasya räjrio janapade atharvä säntipäragah nivasasty api tadrästram vardhate nirupadravam 2 yasya räjrio janapade sa nästi vividhair bhayaih pTdyate tasya tad rästram pahke gaur iva majjati 3 tasmäd räjä visesena atharvänam jitendriyam dänasammänasatkärair nityam samabhipüjayet le tadrästram corr. : tad rästram Ed. The kingdom of that king in whose realm dwells an Atharvavedic master of the rites for warding off ills will prosper, free of all calami ties. The kingdom of that king in whose realm he is not present is oppressed by diverse dangers. It sinks like a cow in the mud. There fore to that Atharvan [chaplain] whose senses are controlled the king should show exceptional honour at all times, by means of gifts, marks of distinction, and demonstrations of respect. I take the 'marks of distinction' (sammänam) to which this passage and its Saiva parallels refer to be those insignia that served to dis tinguish high dignitaries in the court culture of South and South east Asia, attributes such as palanquins, white parasols and fly-whisks with golden handles, which would be displayed whenever such persons appeared in public. The term is used in this sense in the</page><page sequence="42">270 ALEXIS SANDERSON Khmer inscriptions, a corpus rich in records of such honours, 6 and we may compare Atharvavedaparisista 3.1.17: hastyasvam narayanam divyam abharanam atapatram hiranyam ksitigodhanadhänyaratnädikam ca gurave dadyâi [The king] should give his chaplain an elephant and a horse, a palan quin, the finest ornaments for his person, a gold[-handled] parasol, and [valuables] such as lands, cows, coin, grain and jewels. Such insignia were calibrated as to status. The Visnudharmottarci (2.13.7-9b) specifies that the pole of the king's parasol should be six cubits (ca. 2.6 metres) in length, those of the royal chaplain, royal astrologer and head of the army (senäpatih) five, and those of the chief queen (mahisT) and the crown prince (yuvaräjah) four and a half. It seems highly probable that the Saiva officiant would have expected no less than is promised to the royal chaplain in this pas sage, thereby aspiring to recognition as a dignitary second in rank only to the monarch himself. 5. CONCLUSION In depicting Saiva officiants in the role of the traditional royal chap lain, the Netratantra indicates the existence of a new class of Saiva specialists envisaged nowhere else in the corpus of the surviving 96 See K. 762, 6: svasväminaf prasâdàt sa ca räjasabhädhipatyakrtanämäsauvarna kalasakarankasitätapaträdisanmänah [f = Upadhmanïya] 'who had received the title Räjasabhädhipati by the king's favour and been honoured with the golden vase, the [golden] cup, the white parasol and other [insignia]'; K. 809, 43, concerning Indravar man's Saiva officiant Sivasoma: + / + + + + yasya räjena srindravarmmanä*sita (conj. : + + Ep.) chatrapradänädisanmananam akärayat 'he caused him to be hon oured by King Indravarman with such marks of distinction as the white parasol'; K. 725, 20: *ätapaträdisanmänair (conj.: + + + ira dîpanmànair Ed.) asakrt tena satkrtah 'Honoured by him more than once with such marks of distinction as the par asol'. That the sanmänam/sanmananam of the Khmer inscriptions is used in the same meaning as sammànam/sammdnanam here is evident from parallels in which it is linked, as in the Netra and Atharvavedaparisista, with dänam, püjanam (/satkärah) and synonyms; see K. 436, 17: püjdpradanasanmäna\ and K. 81 A 22: visrambha dänasanmänaih yogyo yaf paryyatrpyata. For the golden-handled parasol see, e.g., Pingalamata f. 75rl (10.159a): hemadandam sitam chattram. The granting of such a parasol by the king is frequently mentioned in the Khmer inscriptions; see, e.g., K. 273, 29 , K. 289 C, 54, and K. 323, 80, in the last of which those with this honour (hemadandätapatrinah) are assessed as a distinct class for the purpose of fines.</page><page sequence="43">SAIVA OFFICIANTS - THE KING-S BRAHMANICAL CHAPLAIN 271 Saiva scriptures.97 But what was the nature of this encroach ment? Several scenarios are conceivable. We might imagine that the officiant of this text had taken the place of the brahmanical chaplain altogether or that he coexisted with him, providing the monarch with parallel Saiva observances to double the chaplain's. In the latter case the Saiva officiant might have matched all or only some of the chaplain's activities. It is also possible that the encroachment of the Saiva officiant led to a retrenchment of the brahmanical chaplain's activités, leaving some domains in the hands of the Saiva officiant alone. In the absence of independent historical evidence - as yet I know of none - it is impossible to determine exactly the situation underly ing the textual regulation. But I find the first scenario the least plausi ble, since the dominant tendency in Indian religion has been one of accumulation rather than substitution. Furthermore, though the Netratantra shows us the officiant at work in nearly all the areas assigned to the chaplain it does not match every one of his activities in each. Thus in the area of daily activities we see a close match only in the rituals of protecting the king while he sleeps. There is no men tion, for example, of the early-morning routine of giving the king his garments, ornaments, and perfume, annointing his eyes with col lyrium, and then ritually bestowing on him his horse, his elephant, his palanquin, his sword and other royal insignia.98 Similarly, in the case of the major periodic ceremonies, the Netratantra covers the In dra festival and the autumnal festival of the Goddess, but does not mention the great biannual and annual fire-sacrifices of one hundred 97 It may be objected that the Netratantra is a prescriptive text and that it is there fore illegitimate to infer practice from it, since a prescription may be an exhortation that neither reflects nor brings that about. This is true in principle, but the probabil ity that the Netratantra was the blueprint for an institution that never existed is extremely remote. It is surely much more probable that its purpose, like that of the Saiva scriptures in general, was to authorize and regulate an already existent tradi tion of practice that hitherto lacked adequate scriptural sanction. The principal defect of such materials is not fantasy but schematization. The greater the range of practice that they seek to bring within their scope the greater their tendency to avoid the level of detail that characterizes actual implementation, since in this way they can avoid contradicting the specifics of current variants and instead provide a matrix of prescription withm which all these variants can comfortably be accommodated. 98 These activities are set out in Atliarvavedaparisista 4.1.1-24.</page><page sequence="44">272 ALEXIS SANDERSON thousand and ten million oblations (laksahomah and kotihomali) that are among the brahmanical chaplain's principal periodic duties." One might dismiss these discrepancies by saying that the Netratantra gives only some examples of the officiant's obligations rather than a full account. But that would be plausible only if we had some further reason to suppose that this was so. The alternative would be to sup pose that the reason why rituals such as these fire-sacrifices were not taken over by the Saiva officiant is that they were no part of the chaplain's duties. But that is improbable, since they are included in the accounts of the rituals to be performed for the king by his chap lain in the NTlamatapurâna and Ädipuräna-Tithikrtya, both texts con cerned with Kashmirian practice. The evidence tends therefore to the conclusion that the brahmanical chaplain retained areas in which he alone operated. At the same time it is possible that there were areas of retrench ment. For while rituals such as those of the two great festivals of Indra and BhadrakälT might have been carried out by both the brah manical chaplain and the Saiva officiant working simultaneously, even side by side, it is harder to imagine such co-ordination in the case of the intimate domestic rituals to prepare the king's bed-chamber for his sleep. Here perhaps the Saiva rite had ousted the brahmanical. Whether this new institution was present beyond Kashmir I am unable at present to determine. The existence of an early Nepalese manuscript of the Netratantra, of a manual based on this text for the daily cult of Amrtesvara and Amrtalaksml attributed to the Malla 99 The procedure for these two sacrifices is taught in Atharvavedaparisista 30, 30b, and 3. Visnudharmottara 2.152.6 requires the Kotihoma annually: samvatsardt kotihomam kuryäc ca ghrtakambalam (2.161 is devoted to this procedure [ghrta kambalakotihomah/ghrtakambalasantih']). The Ädipuräna-Tithikrtyav requires two Laksahomas each year and one Kotihoma (11. 2801-2803): dvau laksahomau kur vïta tatha sam vatsaram prati/ekam tu [ko]tihomam tu yatnät sarvàbhayapradam/ atharvavedavidhinà *sammantrya (em : sammantryam Ed.) ca [pu]rohitaih.

Perhaps these references to the Atharvanic procedures are to Atharvavedaparisista 30a, 30b, and 31. For references to Laksahomas and Kotihomas performed for the Khmer and Nepalese monarchs see Sanderson, forthcoming.</page><page sequence="45">SAIVA OFFICIANTS - THE KING'S BRAHMANICAL CHAPLAIN 273 king Abhayamalla, of a manual for royal initiation into this cult, and of other textual evidence of the integration of the worship of Amrtesvara and AmrtalaksmT into the larger framework of Newar Säkta Saivism only shows that this tradition took root there in the manner of any other Saiva system, that is to say, as a form of initia tion and regular worship. It is of course possible that Saiva officiants in the royal palaces of the Kathmandu valley were serving their kings in the manner envisaged in the Netratantra, but the mere presence of a manuscript of that text is not sufficient to prove this, since to be following a tradition of initiation and worship based on the Netratantra would be enough to motivate its copying. If evidence were to come to light that the cult of Amrtesvara and AmrtalaksmT did extend in Nepal beyond the shared essentials of initiation and worship to include encroachment into the territory of the brahmani cal royal chaplain—and this possibility cannot be excluded since many Nepalese liturgical texts in Newari and Sanskrit remain to be studied—then it would be probable that it was established in yet other regions of the subcontinent, at least in the North and East. APPENDIX THE PROVENANCE AND DATE OF THE NETRATANTRA I have asserted above that the Netratantra was composed in Kashmir and at some time between about AD 700 and 850, probably towards the end of that period. Here I set forth the considerations that have led me to these conclusions. In the course of doing so I shall bring forward evidence of the provenance of certain other scriptural texts, notably the Jayadrathayâmala, the Brhatkälottara, and the Visnudharmottara. THE ATTRIBUTES IN SADASIVA'S HANDS Evidence of the Netratantra's provenance is found in its information on the iconic forms under which Siva and other deities should be visualized. In 9.17-25 it pre scribes the image of Sadäsiva, the five-faced and ten-armed form under which Siva is worshipped in the Siddhänta and under which Amrtesvara should be visu alized when it is necessary to worship him in that context. Sadäsiva is nearly always five-faced and ten-armed in our sources. But there is variety in the prescrip tion of the objects and gestures to be exhibited by the ten hands. Now the Netra tantra shows a strongly distinct tradition in this regard: trisülam utpalam banam aksasütram ca mudgaram 9.22 daksinesu karesv evam vämesv evam atah param khetakädarsacäpam ca mätulungam kamandalum</page><page sequence="46">274 ALEXIS SANDERSON 21d ca mudgaram N : samudgaram Ed. 22b vamesv evam at ah par am N : vämesu srnv alah param Ed. 22c khelakctdarsacapam ca conj. : khetakadursu cdpogram N : sphetakädarsacäpam ca Ed. In the right hands are a trident, a blue lotus, an arrow, a rosary and a cudgel. Next [those] in the left hands, as follows: a shield, a mirror, a bow, a citron and an ascetic's water-vessel. This tradition I have seen elsewhere only in the Visnudharmottara: 3.44.18 dasabühus talhä käryo devadevo mahesvarah aksamäläm trisMam ca saram dandam athotpalam 19 tasya daksinahastesu kartavyäni mahäbhuja vämesu mätulungam ca cäpädars'au kamandalum 20 talhä carma ca kartavyam devadevasya sülinah 18d saram em. : iura Ed. And Mahesvara, the God of the Gods, should be made ten-armed. O great armed [hero], one should place a rosary, a trident, an arrow, a cudgel and a blue lotus in his right hands. In the left hands of the Trident-wielder, the God of the Gods, one should place a citron, a bow, a mirror, an ascetic's water vessel, and a shield.100 100 The same attributes are taught in 3.48.9-16 with the information that the ten are five pairs, one held by each of the five deities said here to be fused in the five-faced Sadäsiva image (3.48.3-8): Mahädeva facing forward (the rosary and ascetic's water-vessel), Sadäsiva above (the bow and the arrow), Bhairava looking to the right (the cudgel and citron), Nandin at the rear (the shield and trident), and the goddess Umä looking left (the mirror and blue lotus). Addorsed images of Siva with the lateral faces of Umä, Bhairava/Mahäkäla and Nandin behind are a feature of local Kashmirian tradition as seen in material evidence of the sixth to seventh centuries. We have examples in stone from the Siva temple at Fattegarh (Siudmak 1994, pi. 39a,b) and the Sailaputri temple in Wushkür village (&lt;— Huska pura) (Siudmak 1994, pi. 40a,b), and a related bronze (Pal 1975, pi. 4a,b). The tra dition is also represented in Kashmirian praise of the holy site of Bhütesvara, also called Nandiksetra, located below Mount Harmökh. See Nandiksetramahatmya f. 14rl~4 (vv.165-168): sarvanandimahäkäladevTvadanamanditam/bhütesvaram bhü lapatim drstva martyo vimucyate/pastime vadane vira mama vatsyasi yat sähe/ bhütesvarah sarvabhütah sutTrthäntargato vibhiih/srTkanthah pürvavadane mahäkalo 'tha daksine/pas'cime nandirudras tu devï saumye pratisthitä/bhütesvarasya devasya nandiksetramahäphalam/drsyante vadanesv ete devTnandimahäsiväh 'Mortals are lib erated by seeing Bhütesvara, the Lord of Creatures, adorned with the faces of Sarva [ = Siva], Nandin, Mahäkäla and the Goddess.

The Sarvävatära can only have been written in Kashmir, since its subject matter is restricted to the glorification of Saiva sacred sites in that region, most of which have no place on the pan-Indian pilgrimage map.101 That the Visnudharmottara was written in Kashmir or a neighbouring region follows from a number of factors. (1) There is a strong correlation between the Tlrthas invoked in the Visnudharmottara's Mantra for the Royal Consecration (räjyäbhisekamantrah) taught in chapter 22 of its second Khanda and those sacred sites, mostly Kashmirian, mentioned in the local NTlamata. (2) There is close agree ment between chapter 35 of the second Khanda (strTdevatäpüjananirüpanam) and the religious calendar of Kashmir taught in the NTlamata. (3) Where the Visnu dharmottara prescribes domestic Vaidika rites it adheres to the distinctive proce dures of the Käthakagrhyasütra, also called Laugäksigrhyasütra, the authority followed for these rituals by the brahmins of Kashmir. Thus its Vaisvadeva deities (2.92.3-15) are those of the Kashmirian brahmins as prescribed in Käthakagrhya sütra 4.14.1-20.102 The same applies to the Sräddha rituals, as can be seen by com paring Visnudharmottara 1.140.8-43 with Laugäksigrhyasütramantrahhäsya, vol. 2, pp. 332-363. (4) It fuses the old Kashmirian iconography of the Siva image, with its secondary faces of Umä, Bhairava and Nandin,103 with the pan-Indic tradition of the Saiva Mantramärga, which equates the five faces of Sadäsiva with the five Vedic Brahmamantras (3.48.1-6). And (5) The principal Visnu form in its prescription of the images of deities is the four-faced Vaikuntha, in which the forward-facing 101 Among the sacred places of Kashmir praised in this text are Mahädevagiri and Srïdvâragiri, the mountain-ridge along the east side of the Dal lake, with its various Tîrthas, notably Jyesthesvara and Tripuresvara at Tripar and Suresvan near Ish?bar. 102 For the Kashmirian Vaisvadeva ritual see KäsmTrikakarmakändapaddhati f. 192v and the Saivavaisvadevavidhi. 103 See n. 100 above.</page><page sequence="48">276 ALEXIS SANDERSON anthropomorphic face is flanked by the faces of Varäha and Narasimha, with the face of the sage Kapila at the rear (3.44.9c-13, 3.85.42c-45). This is the principal Kashmirian Visnu image and it is seldom seen elsewhere. The inference that the Netratantras prescription of the hand-attributes of Sadä siva is that of a Kashmirian tradition outside the Saiddhäntika mainstream is strengthened by two further items of evidence. The first is that this type of Sadâs iva has left a trace in no Saiddhäntika scripture other than the Brhatkalottara. That teaches a close variant of the hand-attributes seen in the Netratantra—it differs only in that a sword (khadgah) takes the place of the cudgel (dandah) in one of the hands104—and it contains other indications that it was redacted in Kashmir or under Kashmirian influence, notably the imprint of the non-dualistic Säkta Saiva doctrine and terminology seen in the Spandakärikä, a seminal work of that tradi tion composed in Kashmir towards the end of the ninth century.105 The second is that we have another variant of the Netratantra's Sadäsiva in the Kashmirian liturgical tradition. This is the image of Bahurüpabhairava, who is worshipped with his consort MäyädevT in the Kashmirian Saiva cremation ritual (sivanirvänavidhih). In the hands of this variant a sword takes the place of the blue lotus (mlotpalam) and the gesture of bestowing boons (yaradamudra) that of the mace (gada).106 104 Brhatkälottara B f. 17r5—6: mlamrajanäräcakhadgäksavalayäbhayam/satrisü lam harasyoktam *daksine (em. : daksina Cod.) panca bähavah / bTjapüram dhanus carma varadan ca kamandalum/ väme tu devadevasya bähavah panca kirtitäh. 105 For this imprint see Sanderson 2001, pp. 17-18, n. 19. As further evidence of the Brhatkälottara's Kashmirian origin one may cite its knowledge of the pair ing (to be discussed below) of the two sets of four goddesses associated in Kashmi rian tradition with the Väma and Daksina divisions of the Saiva scriptures. Also consistent with this origin is its use of the term khärkhodah, to be discussed below, and its dependence on the Päncarätrika scripture Jayäkhyasamhitä demonstrated in Sanderson, 2001, pp. 38-^11. That that scripture was produced in Kashmir is highly probable, though not certain. 106 See Sivanirvänavidhi p. 235,1.8-p. 246,1.8 (mundayägah and mäyäjälapüja).

In these cases Amrtesvara should be visualized as Tumburu and Bhairava respectively, those being the presiding deities of those systems, and he should be worshipped sur rounded by the retinues of Saktis proper to those two. These, to mention only the primary circuit of goddesses, are four in each case: Jayä, Vijayä, Ajitä and Aparäjitä in the Varna (11.12-18) and Siddhä, Raktä, Suskä and Utpalahastä (10.17c—34) in the Daksina. The first set of goddesses is given as the inner reti nue of the Varna's Tumburu in all accounts of this cult, and these come from widely separated areas of the Indie world: Kashmir, Gilgit, Nepal, Kerala, Ta milnadu, Cambodia and Bali. But the second set's association with the Daksina's Bhairava, indeed the second set itself, is far less well attested, in spite of the far greater abundance of the textual materials that have survived from this division. Now the only other texts known to me in which these four goddesses, or variants of them, are mentioned are Kashmirian: Jayaratha's commentary on Abhinavagupta's Tantraloka, the Änandesvarapüjä, the Brhatkalottara, the Moksopäya, and the J ay adrathay ämala. Where the Kashmirian Abhinavagupta (fl. c. 975-1025) says that in the Kaula worship of the Trika the deities that surround the central triad of the Goddesses may be twelve, sixteen, four, or indeed whatever set one prefers,107 his compatriot Jayaratha (fl. c. 1250) comments: "The four here are either those beginning with Siddhä or those beginning with Jayä";108 and where Abhinavagupta describes wine as "Mahäbhairava fully radiant with the four Saktis",109 Jayaratha com ments that the four to which he refers are "the set of four beginning with Siddhä", "for", he adds, "these are white, red, yellow and black in colour".110 The Änandes 107 Tanträloka 29.51 : antar dvädasakam püjyam tato 'stästakam eva ca/ catuskam vâ yatheccham vä kä samkhyä kila rasmisu. The sequel reveals that the expression astästakam is to be taken as a Dvandva compound meaning 'eight-and-eight', referring to the eight Kaula Mothers with their eight Bhairavas. 108 Tantralokaviveka ad 29.51c: catuskam iti siddhädi jayädi vä. 109 Tanträloka 37.42d: sakticatustayojjvalam alam madyam mahäbhairavam. 110 Tantralokaviveka ad 37.42d: saktiti *siddhädicatuskam (em.: siddhäcatuskam Ed.). tad dhi sitaraktapitakrsnavarnam.

That the Moksopäya was composed in Kashmir has been estab lished by Jürgen Hanneder, who has also tied the time of its composition to a few years immediately after the reign of the Kashmirian king Yasaskara (r. AD 939 948).118 As for the provenance of the Jayadrathayämala, we must distinguish between the first Satka of six thousand verses and the eighteen thousand verses of the remaining three. The first was originaliy an independent whole. It presents itself as such, predicts no sequel, and is distinct from the other Satkas, which are closely related to each other in style, terminology and concepts.119 In the first I see noth ing that enables us to fix the region of its composition. But the rest of the later text shows clear signs of Kashmirian origin. In the second Satka the only sign I see is the collocation of these two sets of four Saktis. But in both Satkas 3 and 4 there is further evidence. When the fourth Satka sets out the procedures and rituals that must accom pany the copying of a manuscript of the Jayadrathayämala it assumes that the copying will be done on sheets of birch bark (bhürjapaträni).n0 This was the stan dard writing material only in Kashmir and adjacent areas of the northwest. The third Satka contains a chapter devoted to the use of the Mantra of the goddess Ghoraghoratarä in order to gain access to the subterranean paradises of Pätäla (pätälasiddhih). It lists seventeen sites where there are SrTmukhas, special apertures in the earth (bilam) through which this feat can be achieved. The first seven are at sites of pan-Indian fame: Prayäga, Gayä, Srïsaila, Mandalesvara, Hariscandra, the Narmadä river, and the Kälinjara mountain.

It is therefore very unlikely that this is the work of any but a Kashmirian addressing a Kashmirian readershin. Since, therefore, the only sources other than the Netratantra that know the set of the four goddesses Siddhä, Raktä, Suskä and Utpala are Kashmirian, and since there is an abundance of non-Kashmirian sources in which their absence is signifi cant, it is highly probable that the Netratantra too is a work of this region. THE ICONOGRAPHY OF VISNU Further support for this conclusion is provided by the text's iconography of Visnu and Brahma. Of its forms of the former the first is one-faced and four-armed, holding the conch, discus, mace and lotus (13.2-4). The second (13.5-9) is a three faced version of the four-faced Vaikuntha, with a central anthropomorphic head flanked by those of the Boar (Varäha) and the Man-Lion (Narasimha), sur rounded by the goddesses Laksmï, Klrti, Jayä, and Mäyä, and accompanied by his consort Laksmï (13.5-9).

The citation that this introduces is Jayäkhyasamhitä 10.69). The visualization of the four-faced Vaikuntha, the central deity of that scripture, is prescribed in 6.73-76. It is highly improbable that Ksemaräja knew this text in an earlier redaction in which the image had only three faces as in the Netra. For the text does not merely teach a four-faced image. It teaches a system of rites in which the distinction between the three subsidiary faces of Narasimha, Varäha and Kapila, each with its own Mantra, is central.</page><page sequence="57">SAIVA OFFICIANTS - THE KING'S BRAHMANICAL CHAPLAIN 285 The third form, which is not named in the Netratantra, is said by Ksemarâja to follow the prescription of the Mäyävämanasamhitä, another Päncarätrika scrip ture, but one not known to have survived.136 This too is very probably a Kashmiri an tradition. For I see evidence of it elsewhere only in the Haracaritacintämani, a collection of local Kashmirian variants of Saiva myths composed in the thirteenth century by Räjänaka Jayadratha. In that text's account of the origin of the Kash mirian variant of the Sivarätri festival a two-armed, red-clad form of this mysteri ous child Visnu riding a ram, subsequently identified as a manifestation of the deity Samkarsana, comes with Narasimha to rescue the Goddess Pärvafi when the YoginTs had magically extracted her from Siva's heart and sacrificed her to him in his Bhairava form without his knowledge: sivas tad vTksya puratah parijnaya vimrsya ca hrdayam pärvatTsünyam cinlayan ksobham dyayau 45 evamvidham lato värtäm adhigamya janardanah aruhya garudam mesarüpam dvibhuja dyayau 46 sa bülarüpah sauvarnosmso raktämbaro 'pi ca krtdan samäyayau visnus tathd simhatanur narah 47 nrsimhatanunä säkam ksobhayan yogimganam jagarja ghoragambhiram näräyana itas tatah Haracaritacintdmani 31.44-47 When Siva saw that before him, understood it, and reflected upon it, he became greatly disturbed, contemplating his heart that was now empty of PärvatT. Then when Visnu had learned that this had come to pass he arrived in the form of a child, playing, two-armed, wearing a golden turban and a red robe, riding Garuda in the form of a ram. Narasimha [came] too. Accompanied by his Narasimha form Näräyana emitted a deep and terrifying roar [rushing] to and fro amid the band of YoginTs, causing them to quake [with fear]. The Yoginls, eight in number, meditate on the eight Mothers that are their sources. These come forth and join the Yoginis in placating Siva with a hymn. The terrible SivhdutT then arises to devour the YoginTs and a celestial voice calls on Siva to remember his own true nature. This he does and immediately the Supreme Sakti 136 Netroddyota after 13.8c—9, introducing 10: evam srijayäsamhitädrstyoktvä mäyävämanikästhityäpy äha: ... 'Having taught [Visnu] according to the doctrine of the Jayäsamhitä he says, following the rule of the Mäyävämanikä'. ..The form Mäyävämanikä(/*MäyävämanT) is an abbreviation for Mäyävämanasamhitä of the type Bhima for Bhïmasena ('bhïmavat'). The full form Mäyävämanasamhitä is seen in SpandapradTpikä, p. 92. Dropping -samhitä and transferring the feminine ending to the preceding word is a common practice when citing the names of both Päncarätrika and Saiva scriptures. Cf. Pauskarä for Pauskarasamhitä and Sätvatä for Sätvatasamhitä in SpandapradTpikä, pp. 85 and 98, and Kämikä for Kämika samhitä in Tanträloka 4.25c.</page><page sequence="58">286 ALEXIS SANDERSON emerges in her terrible, universal aspect [as Kâlasamkarsanï137]. Evidently this is the true nature that Siva had forgotten. The Yoginls restore PârvatT; a second Sakti of Visnu (in addition to Sivädütl) comes forth to serve her; her two defenders, the first, Visnu, now identified more specifically as Samkarsana, sing a hymn of praise to the terrible Goddess; and she rewards them by granting them the honour of residing on her person as ear-pendants.138 Two features beyond the mere fact of the inclusion of this myth in the Haraca ritacintämani point to its Kashmirian character. The first is the reference to the Goddess's having rewarded Samkarsana and Narasimha by adopting them as her ear-pendants, evidently an aetiological explanation of a detail of her iconography. This detail I have encountered only in manifestations of Kâlasamkarsanï taught in the Kashmirian part of the Jayadrathayämala.m 137 She is not so named directly in this text. But in v. 59 we learn that at the close of these events Siva worshipped her in the midst of the Mothers, offering up Time (kälah) as the sacrificial victim: püjitä mätrmadhye sä kruddhä devT kapälinä/ upahärikr tastatra pasuh kälas ca duhsahah. This element of the myth is surely intended as a semantic analysis of the name KälasamkarsanT 'Withdrawer of Time'. 138 Haracarilacintamani 31.48-58: tatas täh ksobhitäs täbhyäm yoginyo bhayakâ taräh/asmaran svämsa eväntah saranam bhävanäbalät/49 tadbhävanäbalät *svasva (conj : svam svam Ed.) prakalTkrta*vigrahäh (em. : vigraham)/athäviräsan yuga pad brahmänyädyäs ca devatäh/50 paräs täh sodaso devyah pranamya paramesva ram/astuvann anja/Tr baddhvä vicitraih pävanaih stavaih/5\ stutïr vidhäyavidhinä bhüyo 'py etä athävadan/*stutavTryo (conj.: stutivTryam Ed.) nijam vTryam smara deva niräkulah/52 iti stute yogimbhir mahädeve samudyayau/däritäsyä sivädütTyogi nTbhaksanodyatä/53 athodabhüt parä vänT smara rudra nijäm tanum/katham sivo citam rüpam vismrtam te vimrsyatäm/54 tayä girä mahädevo nijam sasmära vigraham/udyayau ca parä saktir adbhutäkärarüpinT/55 ghorä sahasracaranä bhak sayantf caräcaram/brahmändakotTr nirmathya pibantT bhüri sonitam/56 tat ksane yoginïvargo nTtapürväm himädrijäm/punar utpädayäm äsa *svayogena bhayänvitäh (ent.: svayogenäbhayänvitäh Ed.)/57 udyayau vaisnavT saktir aparä sevitum ca täm/simhasamkarsanäbhyäm ca parä saktis tadä stutä/ 58 bhaktyä viracitastoträ devT varayati sma tau/svadhäma dehe karnäbhyäm bhüsanärtham adhatta ca. 139 See Jayadrathayämala, Satka 2, f. 82r7 (visualization of JTvakäh): nrsimhasam karsanakarnalambinr, Satka 2, f. 85v8 (visualization of Ardhamundä/Mahesänakä h): vämakarne pralambantam samkarsanam avasthitam/daksine narasimham syäd\ Satka 2, f. 99v5 (visualization of VïryakâlT): sphurannrsimha*samkars'naprä lambasrutisobliitäm (conj.: samkarnapräiambhasobhinäm Cod.); Satka 3, f. 92r4 (visualization of MatacakresvarT): sahkarsanamahäsimha*sawi(em. : sarva Cod.) karnävalambimm.</page><page sequence="59">SAIVA OFFICIANTS - THE KING'S BRAHMANICAL CHAPLAIN 287 The second is that I see no trace outside Kashmir of this novel myth of extraction, sacrifice and restoration, while in Kashmir itself it appears in a number sources concerned with local traditions. The Ädipuräna-Tithikrtya gives it in the context of Umäcaturthl, the festival of the goddess Umä on the fourth day of the light half of Mägha (December/January).140 The scripture Dütidämara,m the Suresvarïmàhdtmya of the Sarvavatdra,142 the 140 Adipurana-Tithikrtya, 11. 2145, 2147: umacaturthyam maghe tu suklayam yogi niganaih/präg bhaksayitvä *srstä (Cod.: srstvä conj.

Then they all ceased and I thought of you [, believing that you were still hidden] in my heart, and when I could not see you there I was greatly astonished'. Bhairava in his rage smashes the Cakra of the sacrifice. The terrified YoginTs propitiate him with offerings and finally restore the dismembered Goddess to him whole (tatas samagradevïbhis samdhitâparamesvarï 30ab).

The Devyâmata (f. 69r4-vl) has the rosary and water vessel but the two sacrificial ladles (sruk and sruvah) rather than the gesture and ascetic's staff. The Pingalämata (f. 23r4-6) and Mohacürottara (f. 8r6-8) have only three of the Netra's four hand-attributes: the rosary, the ascetic's water-vessel, and the staff. Instead of the fourth, the gesture of protection, the latter prescribes "ba rhis grass, butter, etc." (barhiräjyädikam). The former mentions only the first three. The general scripture Kirana mentions the rosary and water-vessel and perhaps the staff but not the fourth attribute (Patala 52: brahmarüpam prakartavyam catu rvaktram caturbhujam/sakürca pihganetra syäj jatä*]tryamsa\ [for damdal] kama ndalum/saksasütra vratastham tu hamsagam väbjagam tu vä).</page><page sequence="62">290 ALEXIS SANDERSON Saiva authority known to me. Now this unusual iconography corresponds exactly with that of the surviving Kashmirian images of this god.147 LINGUISTIC EVIDENCE Further evidence of the Netratantra's origin in Kashmir is its use of the term khärkhodah (/khärkhodakah)^Ai which according to the commentator Ksemaräja denotes a supernatural device employed by an enemy for such effects as killing or expulsion.149 147 I am aware of four such Kashmirian images: (1) a late seventh-century bronze in the Museum für Indische Kunst, Berlin (Pal, 1975, pl. 3.): four-armed with the Netra's hand-attributes, attended by four small figures rightly identified by Pal as the four Vedas, but single-faced; (2) a black stone Brahma in the Ganapathyära temple in Srinagar dedicated to Sultan Sikandar (r. 1389-1413) (I thank Dr. John Siudmak for sending me a photograph of this image): four-faced and four-armed with the same hand attributes, attended by four small figures, two on each side, their heads lower than Brahma's knees; (3) a Brahma in a relief of Brahma, Siva and Visnu at Nad'hel: four-faced (three represented), four-armed (only the staff can be made out), with four diminutive attendants (Siudmak 1993, p. 638, pi. 50.1 and p. 640, assigning it to the classical Kärkota style of the eighth and first half of the ninth century); and (4) an image in a private collection assigned to the late seventh or early eighth century (Siudmak 1993, p. 640-42, pi. 50.3; 1994, pi. 125). This is very similar to the Berlin bronze. The outer right holds a staff (dandah) and the inner left shows the abhayamudrä. The other two arms are lost. It has been broken off across the thighs but we still have the heads and necks of two small figures on the right. These are evidently two of the four Vedas (Siudmak 1993, p. 640). 148 Netra 18.4ab: paraprayuktä nasyanti *krtyäkhärkhodakäni ca(N : krtyäkhärk hodakädayah Ed.)

The latter position is the original, since it is that which we see in the Iranian source as evi denced by Avestan kaxvarse6a- (m.), kax"ar3iôT- (f.) denoting a kind of malevo lent spirit, probably associated with sorcery.151 This is the source of the forms khakkhorda-, khahkhorda-, khakkhorda- and khakhorda- seen in early northwest ern and Central-Asian Sanskrit sources152 and in the Gändhärl (Kroraina Pra krit) of the KharosthI documents of the third century ad from Niya in Xinjiang,153 and of the käkhorda- that appears in Mahäyäna-Buddhist works.154 Over against these we have the form kharkhoda- seen in the Netratantra and a variant khärkhota, in which the r has migrated from the final to the second con sonant. It is only in this form that the word occurs in non-Buddhist sources; and I have found it outside the Netratantra only in works that were composed or redacted by Kashmirians.

THE DATE As for the date of its composition, I have proposed above that the approximate outer limits are AD 700 and 850. The posterior limit is established by the fact that the text teaches the Vaikuntha form of Visnu without the face of Kapila at the rear. It is therefore unlikely to have been composed later than the middle of the ninth cen tury, since it was from that time that the four-faced form replaced the three-faced in Kashmirian images.163 The prior limit cannot be placed before the end of the formative period of Kashmirian iconography, that is to say, the late seventh century. For it is only after that time that the Brahma icon taught in the Netratantra is seen in the stone and bronze images of the region. However, the iconography of the four-armed form of Siva taught in 13.29-30 makes it probable that the work was composed towards the end of this period, c. 800-850. The hands' attributes are the trident paired with the gesture of protec tion, and the citron paired with the rosary.164 The pairing of the citron and the rosary is seen outside Kashmir from an early date.165 But in Kashmir we see the 163 See nn. 133-134 above. 164 Netra 13.30: caturbhujam mahätmänam süläbhayasamanvitam/mätuluhgadha ramdevam aksasütradharam prabhum. 165 We see it in a fifth-century Liiiga with a bust of a three-headed Siva, which, Si udmak proposes, (1994, pi. 43) is from the cave known in Pashtu as Kashmir Smast ('the cave to Kashmir'), located 25 km north of Shahbazgarhi on a mountain top between the Peshawar valley and Buner: the left hand holds the citron and the right the rosary. The same two were probably in the front hands of the famous three faced "Mahesamürti" of the late sixth century in the Siva cave at Elephanta. The cit ron is clear in the left hand and though the rosary is not visible in the damaged right hand of the posture, which is raised with out-turned palm, suggests its presence. They are also seen in the two front hands of the three-faced bust of Mahesvara in the inner sanctum (garbhagrham) of the Siva temple constructed in ad 637 at Ku suma in the Sirohi district of SW Rajasthan (Meister, 1988, pp. 208-214; pi. 437); and a citron is held in the lower left hand of a six-armed, three-faced Mahesvara carved in the centre of the wooden door frame of the Uttaresvara temple at Ter in the Osmanabad District of Maharashtra (early 7th century?). The lower and middle right hands are lost, but a rosary may well have been in the former. The other three surviving hands hold a cobra (upper right), a lotus (middle left), and a mace sur mounted by a Linga (upper right) (cf. Collins, 1988, p. 117).</page><page sequence="66">294 ALEXIS SANDERSON ascetic's water-vessel rather than the fruit in the early centuries.166 The citron appears in our Kashmirian images only from the ninth century.167 ABBREVIATIONS Annual Report on [South Indian] Epigraphy. Archaeological Survey of India, 1887 Bodleian Library, Oxford Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Pune The reading of the manuscript My conjectural emendation My correction The reading of the published edition My emendation The reported reading of an inscription Khmer inscription, numbered as in Cœdès, 1966 Kashmir Series of Texts and Studies The reading of the Nepalese Amrtesatantra manuscript National Archives of Nepal, Kathmandu Nepal-German Manuscript Preservation Project South Indian Inscriptions. Archaeological Survey of India, 1980 166 This we see in Gandharan Siva images of the fourth and fifth centuries (Si udmak, 1994, plates 41-43 and 59) and in a number of Kashmirian images whose hand-attributes have survived: (1) the Fattegarh three-headed Mahesvara of the fifth to sixth centuries (Siudmak, 1994, pl. 39a,b ); and (2-3) two three-headed Mahesvaras from Pândrêthan of the latter half of the seventh century (Siudmak, 1994, plates 85-86). This iconography continued after the introduction of the other, since we see it in a grey chlorite four-armed Siva and PärvatT group now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (no. 1989.362) that is probably of the first half of the ninth century (Siudmak, 1994, pi. 117). 167 We see this in (1) the Siva with consort in the Kashmirian 'brahmanicai triad' (Pal, 1975, pi. 2: '9—1 Oth century'): Siva is seated on Vrsa (his bull) with PärvatT on his left thigh and holds the rosary and citron in his inner right and left hands. In his outer right he holds a trident, and in outer left a snake; (2) the two armed single-faced Siva of a Kashmirian ekamukhalingam (Pal, 1975, pi. 5: '8-9th cen tury') (= Reedy, K55); (3) a Kashmirian grey chlorite group of c. 850 (Siudmak, 1994, pi. 116; Pal, 2003, pi. 67 [but dated 750-800]); and (4) the 'Siva-PärvatT' image set in the GaurTsankara temple in Chamba (Pal, 1975, pi. 85: TOth century').</page><page sequence="67">SAIVA OFFICIANTS - THE KING'S BRAHMANICAL CHAPLAIN 295 REFERENCES Primary Sources: Manuscripts and Editions Agnikäryapaddhat.

But the resulting date, ad 749, is im plausibly early for this text. Dr. Divakar Acharya of the Mahendra Sanskrit Univer sity, Kathmandu, who has recently located the manuscript, has reported that the script is west-Indian in appearance and that the date is therefore probably to be cal culated in the Valabhi era. This report was passed on to me by Dr. Dominic Goodall in an e-mail message of April 23, 2004. Year 806 after the Valabhi era is ad 1123/24, an entirely plausible date.</page><page sequence="70">298 ALEXIS SANDERSON Vijayesvaramähätmya attributed to the Ädipuräna.
