<plain_text><page sequence="1">MASSES OF MONKEYS Colin Eisler In many ways H. W. Janson was the essential encyclopedist, despite his modest disclaimer in Apes and Ape Lore in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance that this "was not intended to form a complete Pithecopaedia." His was a matchless mastery of sheer information and a life-long passion for the infinite splendors of fact. Lucid marshaling of the Geschichte of Kunst gave him global fame and fortune. But in the longest run neither his many-millioned, multilingual History of Art nor the Donatello may prove the books for which Janson will be best remembered. That literary monument might well be the Apes, published in 1952 by London's Warburg Institute, whose magi-in exile had helped shape Janson's intellectual perspective two decades earlier, in Hamburg. His objective, productive acceptance of the fact that monkey business is what so much of life is all about contributed to Janson's prodi gious success. Those clever beasts' pursuit of imitation lies at the epicenter of art and teach ing alike. Apes and Ape Lore is an encyclopedic miroir historiale et morale of humanity without Fig. 1 Albrecht Durer, Monkey Dance. 1523. Pen drawing.

That book is the verso of Civilisation's coin. But where the late Lord Clark's Spatwerk in not so haute vulgarisation is soon forgotten, Janson's Apes, written in the prime of its mas ter's life, remains an essential speculum of mortal understanding or, to paraphrase the title of a recent, popular essay in self-study, Our Monkeys, Ourselves. The most persuasive study of Durer's Mon key Dance (Fig. 1), drawn in 1523 (with a let ter on the verso to the Swiss clergyman who ordered it), appears in Apes and Ape Lore in the chapter "The Sexuality of Apes." Janson recognized the sketch as "an oeuvre d 'occasion which at first glance may appear to be a bit of drdlerie but which on closer inspection reveals a wealth of allusive meaning entirely worthy of the master's genius." He went on to note that "The Affentanz is, of course, a parody, but a parody on several levels at once. Diirer prob ably started out with the traditional metaphoric meaning of 'ape dance' . . . the instability of earthly pleasure."1 Convincingly, Janson then related the draw ing to Hans Leinberger's woodcut (Fig. 2) of amorous men in a competitive dance for the favors of a woman holding an apple and a mir ror, attributes of carnal pleasure and vanity, both of which are also held by the largest, cen trally placed monkey in Diirer's drawing.

Hund I, cat. no. 12, p. 68, pi. 97 as Florentine, c. 1460-1470 ly ingeniously, Janson also linked the page to a late fifteenth-century engraving of morris danc ers (Fig. 3), which Durer is known to have also consulted for other figures. He pointed out how the flaming vessel at the center often appears in scenes of witchcraft, concluding, "Our drawing, then, has a further significance connected with popular superstition and magic relating to sex. The dancers seem to be engaged in a kind of frenzied rite through which they hope to ac quire the degree of virility displayed by the conspicuously masculine simian who leads the proceedings."2 That reading may prove true on the lowest level, but how does it gibe with the lofty calling of the man who ordered it, Hans Frey, a Zwing lian divine of Zurich? After reading Durer's letter on the back of his drawing for Frey, one must conclude that Janson's purely (or impure ly) erotic interpretation is, as he himself sug gested, less than the whole story. My dear and gracious Master Frey, I have received the little book you sent to Master Varnbuler and me; when he has finished reading it I will read it too. As to the monkey dance you want me to draw for you, I have drawn this one here, un skillfully enough, for it is a long time since I saw any monkeys; so pray put up with it. Convey my willing service to Master Zwingli, Hans Leu, Hans Vrich and my other good Masters. Albrecht Durer Divide these five little prints amongst you; I have nothing else new.3 Varnbuler was a friend of the artist's and a very powerful man, both in physical appearance</page><page sequence="4">7 (as shown in Diirer's splendid woodcut of 1522) and in rank, a protonotarius of the Holy Ro man Empire. Of Swiss birth and active as a diplomat, Varnbiiler may have met Frey. Schol ars suggest that the book sent to him by the clergyman was a Reformation tract, probably Zwingli's Eine Kurtze und Christentliche in leitung, printed in Zurich in 1523, or Ludwig Hatzer's treatise on religious imagery published there in the same year.4 All the other names in Frey's letter refer to residents of Zurich whom Durer may have met when, as seems to have been the case, he ac companied his dearest friend Willibald Pirck heimer and another Nuremberg aristocrat, Mar tin Tucher, on a diplomatic mission to cement the ties between the Swiss and German cities.5 This mission took place between April 27 and July 4, 1519, just a few months after Zwingli had first come to Zurich at the end of 1518 as the people's priest at the Miinster. Felix Frey was Zwingli's associate and became the first re form provost of Saint Charles in Zurich. Hans Leu was that city's leading painter, probably apprenticed to Diirer c. 1510 and a follower of the Reformation. Urich appears to have been a local bell caster and, in view of the company he kept in this letter, also a Protestant. The year 1523, in which the Monkeys were drawn and sent to Switzerland, could be called Zwingli's year. Though he had first preached the Gospel in 1516, taking an ever more promi nent place by his stress on Christ's teachings, it was only in 1523 that his word won out over the pope's in a public debate in Zurich. The city left the Catholic canton of Constance, and soon Zwingli persuaded Bern to join his side. He also prepared his Sixty-seven Articles in the same year, stating that the Eucharist was no more than a memorial to Christ's past sacrifice. In a commentary on the canon of the Mass, also printed in 1523 (September), Zwingli denounced the references to oblation in the missal as "blasphemy."6 Two years before, Luther had written, "Masses which they call sacrifices are the height of idol atry and impiety," so evil that they could only have been the invention of the devil.7 In 1522, writing Against King Henry of England, the re former stated plainly: "Once the mass has been overthrown, I say we'll have overthrown the whole of Popedom."8 In one of his Invocavit sermons of the same year, for March 10, de voted to the preaching of the word alone with out enacting the Mass, Luther stressed the necessity to win the congregant's confidence so that the word alone could suffice. Writing of the compulsion for more than the preaching of the Gospel, Luther noted how this leads to "shadow-boxing {Spiegelfechten), superficiality and mockery (Affenspiel); to human laws, double-dealers and dissemblers since it does away with good conscience."9 These evil consequences result when the word of God is not enough. By implication, Luther's text, kindly brought to my attention by Werner Hofmann, suggests that the performance of the Mass involves such images as cavorting apes (.Affenspiel) and mirror images, since the Ger man for shadowboxing means mirror fencing (Spiegelfechten). These metaphors for folly, for the vain need for proof when the word should be more than enough, are close to Du rer's dancing figures and may have inspired his Swiss Protestant patron in his choice of subject. Calvin's arguments against the sacrificial Mass were as fierce as those of Zwingli and Luther, seeing it as an abomination of the devil: "Satan never devised a more effective engine for at tacking and vanquishing Christ's realm."10 Writ ing in 1523, the same year as Durer's drawing, Zwingli denied the possibility of sacrifice in the Eucharist in the absence of "real bloodshed and slaughter."11 Durer s Monkey Dance comes at the end of a life-long interest in singerie. His first and most realistic ape appears at the lower center of Christ among the Doctors (Dresden). One of the young</page><page sequence="5">artist's first major commissions, it was possibly painted for the Wittenberg court chapel of the elector of Saxony, Frederick the Wise, who had founded the university there in 1502. The elec tor had engineered Luther's abduction to the Wartburg in 1521 to save the reformer's life. Diirer's most impassioned support of Luther came in that year, writing in his travel journal that he prayed for Luther's resurrection when the reformer seemed to have been "slain by the perfidy of the pope and his money as Christ had been by the hands of the priests." "He has suffered for the sake of Christian truth and for having condemned the un-Christ like papacy, which obstructs the redemption of Christ with its oppressive man-made laws."12 The artist's explicit association with the new theology of the Reformation is found in Boden stein of Karlstadt's dedication to Durer on his treatise on the nature of the Eucharist in 1521.13 His woodcut of the Last Supper and the Institution of the Eucharist has, as noted by Panofsky, by omitting the lamb and showing the chalice alone, followed Luther's word in the Kelchstreit, stressing that the Lord's Supper "is not a sacrifice."14 When Durer wrote the Swiss reformer who ordered the Monkey Dance that he had not seen monkeys for a long time, he seems to have forgotten the fact that only two years before he had admired these beasts in the Netherlands. On his fourth stay in Antwerp he had noted in his diary: "I have spent four golden guilders for little sea-cats (mehr kaczlein)."15 Conway translated that as "a little baboon" while Rup prich, more accurately, read the phrase as refer ring to two Seekatzen— presumably small Afri can monkeys like the one shown in the artist's early engraving of the Virgin and Child with the Monkey.16 There, as in the Christ among the Doctors, the ape is shown chained, symbol izing the conquest of evil, the monkey, as Luther continued to believe, being a creature of the devil.17 Diirer need not have apologized for his dis tinctly anthropomorphic monkeys. Nothing could have better suited the propagandistic pur pose of the Zwinglian minister who had ordered the drawing, doubtless as a design for a wood cut broadside in the "battle of the pictures" which played such a critical role in the Refor mation. Since Frey's calling was more concerned with the ministry than with monkeys, what was his reason for asking for the apes dancing in a ring? Might they, as Luther's lines of 1522 sug gest, be associated with a satire of the Mass? This is clearly the case, judging by the mid sixteenth-century writings of another Swiss re former, Pierre Viret, a leading preacher in Lyons. There the Huguenots, as described by Natalie Zemon Davis, were hoping "through God's aid to change the social structure of the city by eliminating the clerical class. They would silence the clergy's lies, banish their 'charms', 'monkeyshines' and 'Moorish dances' from the temples."18 These three evils of the Catholic priests are the subject of Diirer's drawing, which, as Janson saw, had as its source the quattrocento engraving of the morris or Moorish dance (Fig. 3). At the center Dtirer placed the "charm" of witchcraft's magical fire as his dancers performed circular monkeyshines. The morris dance itself represented the key issue of the Reformation—the diabolical char acter of the Mass. Viret characterized that cen tral ceremony of Catholic faith as "more danc ing, turning et morisque," in his satire of the priestly office in which the ministrant's gestures recall those of "les basteleurs, apres qu'ils on bien sauter et danser leur singes."19 Lest this interpretation of Durer's monkeyshines be seen as yet another example of the excesses of the iconographer gone ape, of the mystification of pseudo-scholarly hocus pocus, let the reader be ware that that very last phrase is a Reformation satire against the Mass, a corruption of hoc est corpus, a basteleuf s burlesque of the priestly "trick" of transubstantiation.20</page><page sequence="6">9 NOTES 1.
