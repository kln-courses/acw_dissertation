<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Chapter  x Initiating young males and   commemorating the dead On nose piercing and spirit poles One may initially doubt the connection between the Kamoro ritual marking  of male adolescents’ maturity by nose piercing and the Asmat commemora- tion of the dead marked by erecting a spirit pole. One difference is that Asmat  nose piercing of boys and girls is not celebrated but is an informal private  act performed during childhood; another is that the various descriptions of  Asmat spirit-pole myths and rites do not include the initiation of males. Yet  since the Mbish rituals are considered the ‘male’ counterpart of ‘female’ Emak  Cem, one might assume the initiation of male adolescents into maturity to be  part and parcel of boys’ Mbish rites. Some observers even consider the mbish  pole the ‘vertical’ coastal version of the ‘horizontal’ inland spirit canoe, on and  around which male adolescents are initiated. This interpretation finds sup- port in the fact that the bottom portion of a mbish pole often depicts a mini- ature canoe (for an illustration see Konrad, Konrad and Sowada 2002:155). In  line with this, this portion is called canoe (ci) (Kuruwaip 1974:20). Further, the  mbish pole is strikingly similar to (yet different from) the Kamoro mbitoro,  which is explicitly associated with the initiation of males.  A commonly held Asmat view ascribes the mbish spirit pole to the Bismam  group, literally ‘the makers/carvers of the mbish’. This group includes the  coastally oriented settlements of Central Asmat between the Unir River north  of Flamingo Bay and the Ewta River of Ocenep, on the border with Casuarinen  Coast settlements. The spirit-pole ritual has spread from there to settlements of  the upper Sirec River like Yao-Sokor and Fos, and to the Casuarinen Coast.1  The riddle of the seeming absence of a connection between the Mbish ritual  and the initiation of male adolescents into maturity is solved when one learns  that initiation, together with the Mbish ritual proper, was part of the head- 1 For details, see Kuruwaip 1974:11. </page> <page sequence="2"> 194 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua hunting rites and practices which were discontinued in the 1960s. Since then,  the Mbish ritual has lived on in its own right up to the present day. It is still  strongly reminiscent of war and of headhunting. The first of the two myths  specifically associated with Mbish also has affinities with one of the found- ing myths of headhunting. The initiation component of the Mbish ritual is no  longer celebrated. It differs from the initiation of male adolescents connected  with the spirit canoe. It is briefly discussed by Zegwaard, but under a differ- ent heading, Nao Pokmbu (Zegwaard n.y.e:25). The severed head of a man  killed during a headhunting party is ceremonially offered by the killer to his  adolescent real or classificatory younger brother or son. By this act the latter is  proclaimed an adult. He assumes the name of the dead man, and henceforth  his relatives will address him by this name and even treat him as if he were the  actual person. Since headhunting has been discontinued, it follows that this  type of initiation no longer exists.  The myths: a summary The story of Seitakap This narrative was told to Abraham Kuruwaip, curator of the Asmat Museum  of Culture and Progress in Agats, by a man called Bai of Ac, and confirmed  by four narrators of Amanamkai and Omanesep, three settlements on or near  the Bec River (Kuruwaip 1974:12-4).  Inland, on a site of paradisal abundance at the confluence of the Sirec and  Sitan or Brazza Rivers [Kuruwaip mistakenly speaks of a place called Sitan]  live Beworpic [pic, ‘man’] and his wife Tewerawoc [woc, ‘woman’; these two  names occur regularly in Asmat narratives] and their two children. Far away  downstream at the mouth of the Sirec River live the older and younger brother  Tewer and Seitakap at a site where there is hunger, sickness and war.2 Seitakap  is an outgoing and cheerful person. His older brother admonishes him to keep  quiet because of the imminent danger of attack. Beworpic furtively approach- es the two brothers, throws his spear and kills Seitakap, then cuts off his head  and slices up his body. He returns home. His wife notices him approaching  the settlement and throws lime, out of joy and excitement. From all corners  of the village people rush to the scene and accompany Seitakap’s head to the  men’s house. His flesh is distributed carefully and the bones are thrown into  2 I wonder if the opposition between an inland of abundance versus coastal misery may be  ascribed to Kuruwaip’s Christian interpretation of the upper world as heaven and the under- world as an evil place; he derives the name of the Sirec River from Surku, which is presumably  a corruption of Indonesian surga, ‘heaven’. </page> <page sequence="3"> X  Initiating young males and commemorating the dead 195 the fire. There is drumming and dancing. Suddenly, a strange voice is heard  coming from the fire. It is Seitakap’s voice, explaining that he is not really  dead, but has already travelled to the underworld, by way of the Ayiw River,  which connects the present world with the abode of the ancestors. The ances- tors have instructed him to return to the living and teach them a new custom  that will keep them in touch with their ancestors and bring them happiness.  He teaches them a new sacred song, which is to be used only by male adults  and always with great reverence: ‘Seitakap, Seitakap, you have been lost;  you went by way of the Ayiw River and you have returned, for me you have  returned.’ He tells them that the ancestors have promised to protect the living  as long as the living make carvings to commemorate the dead and name them  after the deceased. A dead man’s deceased wife and children must be com- memorated in the same way. After having sung the Daiso song celebrating the  successful manhunt that took place before he heard the voice from the fire,  Beworpic replies that he is ready to learn the new song. He immediately cuts  down a nutmeg tree (tow) and follows the carving instructions given by the  ‘returned’ victim Seitakap. The story then relates how to proceed. All the men  are instructed to sing another new song before beginning to carve the mbish:  ‘Mbish! Dance and hide with a peaceful heart. Mbish! You have preceded me  [us] and are now hidden. You dance the dance that comes from your heart.  The hair on your head moves and there is a union between seen and unseen.’  They first carve Beworpic’s deceased father. Seitakap then orders the men to  sanctify the carving with blood drawn from the victim’s [Seitakap’s] head and  body that they have eaten. Seitakap tells them that it is blood that makes the  mbish powerful.  The story of Mbish, the ideal wife This attractive lively narrative, replete with colourful details, was recorded  in the vernacular by Zegwaard in the 1950s, presumably in Shuru; the nar- rator is unknown.3 Kuruwaip recorded a shortened, less accurate, and less  detailed version told by Ewerpic and Sakarpic of Ewer, confirmed by various  carvers of Shuru (Kuruwaip 1974:14-7). A long time ago a very beautiful girl, called Mbish, lived in Kaymo, mid- stream on the Sirec River. Her beauty aroused the emotions of Dariw, the head- man of one of the men’s houses, so much so that he neglected his responsibili- ties as leader and even blocked the central hearth at a ceremonial distribution  of sago grubs to celebrate the completion of a new men’s house: he demanded  Mbish as his wife. However, after marrying her he became so jealous and  suspicious that he did not allow her to leave the house, and even forced her  3 For the full English text, see Offenberg and Pouwer 2002:112-7. </page> <page sequence="4"> 196 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua to sleep in a sack he made out of two sleeping mats. She was given food and  drink and was allowed to defecate through one and the same opening in the  sack. It was not long before she grew dirty, began to smell, felt miserable, and  lost her appetite. Her husband decided to organize a headhunting feast. At  that feast he would take her out of the sack and do her the great honour of let- ting her become a naowam woman, a woman who severs the head of the victim  while beautifully decked out and wearing a naowam, a frond made from pieces  of bamboo: the queen of the headhunting feast. While Dariw set out to real- ize his plan, Mbish’s older sister Waise took the opportunity to liberate Mbish  and wash her in the river. She then lit a big fire to get rid of her awful smell  by means of perspiration. Mbish’s relatives gave her a new apron and a good  meal. They put sago and fishing gear into a big bag and took her in a canoe  to the junction of the Sirec River with the Sitan or Brazza River. She was then  left on the shore, and had to make her own way to the land of the ancestors  at the source of the Sirec/Sitam, inhabited by people living high in the trees.  Meanwhile her husband returned with a slain enemy, but hearing that his wife  had run away he cancelled the ceremony. Searching in vain and abandoned  by his followers, he died of sheer misery. [Father Baudhuin4 recorded the text  of a song called pis [mbish] purmbut recited in Ewer during a recent Mbish  ceremony, which vividly describes Dariw’s attempt to make a canoe in order  to follow Mbish, ‘like a wriggling snake follows its prey’. However, nobody  gave him a hand. While he was cutting down a tree single-handedly to make  a canoe, a splinter pierced his body and killed him.]  Mbish had begun her long walk to the headwaters of the river, setting  up camp every evening. Trees and animals, well disposed to her, assisted  her in crossing rivers and land. A high palm tree lifted her over the forest. A  cassowary adopted her and showed her the way. After three days and three  nights they reached the sacred Ayiw River, which connects the earth with the  world of the ancestors in the mountains. From afar they heard a faint sound  that turned out to be the sound of Pupuripic, literally ‘hornblower’, the son  of [yet another] Beworpic and Tewerawoc. For years the hornblower had been  trying to enchant his beloved Mbish with the sound of his magic triton shell,  the name of which is taboo and hidden beneath its pseudo-identification as  a bamboo horn. His parents met with Mbish after his father tried in vain to  kill the cassowary with his spear. They were then told that the cassowary was  her stepmother. It also appeared that Mbish’s earthly mother and Pupuripic’s  upperworld mother were namesakes [compare Kamoro namesakes in myths].  The hornblower slid from his tall tree and discovered the beautiful Mbish hid- den in a mat by his parents [a perfect contrast with her earthly sack of mats].  The couple had a wonderful hunting and sago-beating honeymoon. Now and  4 Baudhuin and Capu 1996:42-158, cited by Van der Zee 2005:451. </page> <page sequence="5"> X  Initiating young males and commemorating the dead 197 then Mbish went off with other women. At such times he missed her badly.  One day he hit upon an idea. He felled a nutmeg tree, divided the trunk into  three sections, and carved a female figure in the middle section, birds and  other animals in the upper part (in fact the root), and a canoe/bowl for food in  the lower section: the first-ever mbish. Whenever a beloved one is absent, you  can still have a wooden image of him or her.  Meanwhile a coastal, earthly grandson and namesake of Beworpic in the  upper world had heard the magic shell. He had gone into the interior to meet  his namesake-grandfather. He asked for the magic shell. It was refused. But  then Pupuripic made a formal statement: ‘From now on, son [Beworpic jun- ior], you will take over my place and my name. I will move to the coast and  settle with Mbish in Sarew. From now on my name will be Fumiripic, the  Hornblower.’ And so it happened.  Comments The first story is evidently a spin-off of the myth institutionalizing headhunt- ing.5 Its plot and construction are strikingly similar. The main characters  of the headhunting myth are Desoipic (man with wound) and his younger  brother Biwir-ipic or Bewor-ipic (coloured-parrot man, compare Emak Cem  Ufiripic, ‘king-parrot man’). They live by themselves, probably inland; there  are no other humans. Because of his physical condition the older brother has  to stay indoors and the younger has to go out to support him. No longer  content with his younger brother bringing him merely the head of a hunted  pig and pinning it to the floor in front of him, the older brother suggests that  he replace it with a human head, his own head. The younger brother pro- tests vehemently, but finally gives in. He severs his older brother’s head. The  detached head of the self-professed victim then begins to speak and to give  instructions to Beworpic, his younger brother and killer, on how to proceed  with the (his) head and the body. The ensuing ritual is then spelled out. In  a similar fashion, but then in a peopled world, the severed head of coastal  Seitakap tells the inland killer Beworpic how to proceed with the ritual. The  similarities between the two institutionalizing stories are too striking to be  merely coincidental. The severed head plays a dominant part in the initia- tion of a son or a younger brother of the headhunter. The initiate takes the  place and name of the victim. One gets the definite impression that the first  Mbish narrative was modelled on the basic headhunting narrative after the  cessation of the practice of headhunting, as a way to legitimate the retained  Mbish ritual.  5 For the full story, see Zegwaard 1959:1021-6, and Offenberg and Pouwer 2002:192-5. </page> <page sequence="6"> 198 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua House posts. Ewer, Asmat, 1993. Photograph by Ursula Konrad. As for the relation of the first to the second Mbish story, it is notewor- thy that they share two main characters, the inland Beworpic and his wife  Tewerowoc, and the upstream site at the Sitam River, the gateway to the  upper world. They also share the distinction between inland and coast. The  configurations of the narratives differ. The narrative of Mbish, the ideal wife,  accounts in a widely recognized and far more romantic manner for the carving  of a beloved wife. However, it also expands the reasons for carving, namely  to commemorate any beloved absent woman or man. Physical absence and  separation probably also connote death. After all, the beloved Mbish did cross  the boundary between the living and the dead (the ancestors). Zegwaard also  mentions a version from Ao told to Fleischhacker and Schneebaum, according  to which Mbish dances with the other women on the evening of her marriage  and dies the following night. Her mourning husband ties her body in a corner  of the yew, and it is then transformed into a wooden statue (Offenberg and  Pouwer 2002:117). Note that alongside the romantic aspect of the story there  is the realistic picture of an aggressive war leader who is despised and in  the end abandoned by his followers. Such leaders do occur and are dreaded.  Sometimes they are dismissed.  The Mbish narrative ends with a surprising transformation. The carver  Pupuripic yields his place and name to his ‘son’, that is, the grandson and  namesake of his father Beworpic. This grandson left the coast to meet his  inland grandfather. In his turn Pupurupic and his beloved Mbish move from  the inland to the coast, where he takes his ‘son’s’ place and adopts the name  </page> <page sequence="7"> X  Initiating young males and commemorating the dead 199 Fumiripic, the hornblower. So he is, or is at least equated with, the Asmat cul- ture hero who carves out male and female human figures in the foundation  piles of the yew and drums them to life while travelling west to the Kamoro,  as far as Kaokonao and even Kaimana. There is also a fascinating Kamoro  connection with the Mbish story. Although Mamirima, the Kamoro counter- part of Asmat Fumiripic, is not credited with the creation of male and female  ancestors, but with the founding of Kaware, a well-known Kamoro Ema Kame  myth does have affinities with Fumiripic’s creative act, at least as far as the  origin of female ancestors is concerned.6 In this story the original female ances- tors of the Kamoro, the kaoka oko, literally ‘genuine women’, living in a coast- ally oriented settlement, abandon their husbands because they were cheated  by them. Their place is taken by the wamoko kaoka, literally ‘upstream women  from the inland forest’, depicted as varieties of forest animals but equally and  fully human. The latter are considered to be the female ancestors of the present  Kamoro. According to Zegwaard and later Coenen, they are also called amoko  kaoka, ‘culture hero women’, but I wonder whether Zegwaard perhaps con- fused amoko with wamoko. In my opinion they are not superhuman but in  fact inferior to kaoka oko, the original, genuine women. In the myth wamoko  rate as second-class women and are sometimes disparagingly referred to as  quadrupeds. Male adolescents from Kaokonao, who had many contacts with  foreigners, even called them cheats and shit women (Offenberg and Pouwer  2002:183). After abandoning their husbands, these ‘genuine women’ travelled  from the eastern part of Mimika to Etna Bay in the far western part of Mimika.  They are seen as the ancestors of white foreigners (Offenberg and Pouwer  2002:138). They left for the West after constructing a steamer by drawing  one in the sand. Other descendants of these women are said to live along the  upper course of a river at Etna Bay (Offenberg and Pouwer 2002:148). A well- informed storyteller, familiar with East Mimika, told Zegwaard in Keawkwa  that these ‘genuine women’ originated from man-size mbitoro made by men  who provided them with attractive ideal physical features. The statues came  to life in the course of the night (Zegwaard 1952:31). So here is the link with  Mbish, the ideal Asmat woman, and her lover-carver Pupuripic, transformed  into Fumiripic. The Keawkwa informant did not refer to Mamirima. This link  puts the individual Asmat ‘romance’ in a wider social and even cross-cultural  perspective of the life cycle. The individual inland Asmat maker of com- memorative statues of beloved ones and endeared dead is transformed into  the coastal creator of male and female statues coming to life as human beings.  For the patri-centred Asmat, these constitute the ancestors of the neighbouring  Kamoro and of foreigners. For the matri-centred Kamoro, the coastal ‘genuine  6 For the myths, see Chapter II and Offenberg and Pouwer 2002:137-58 and 182, notes 31 and  32.  </page> <page sequence="8"> 200 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua women’ (also manufactured by males) are, by default, equally the ancestresses  of foreigners, superior to their own ancestresses. A difference in lineal orienta- tion shows up in an enchanting cross-cultural pas de deux, a mixture of unity  in diversity. The rituals Kuruwaip is the first observer to give a lengthy account of the Mbish ritual  (Kuruwaip 1974:20-4). His description may be summarized as follows: the  ceremony can be divided into six stages, in accordance with the stages in  carving the mbish. The feast takes six or seven months. After an agreement  has been reached as to which persons will be commemorated by the carvings  and the obligations for the living relatives and affines, the war leader blows  his bamboo horn for a meeting of all males. The men are told to decorate  their bodies and paint (or repaint) their canoes. They depart from the village  in search of a proper tree, amid shouting and excitement as if they are going  into battle. The women remain in the village and, by way of exception, enter  the men’s house to drum, dance and sing. The men divide into three groups:  one gathers bunches of young sago leaves, the second clears the undergrowth  around the selected tree, and the third remains in the canoes as guards. The  sago leaves are tied to the selected trunk as a decoration. The men then return  to the village. A few days later they depart again to cut and prepare sago trees  for growing sago grubs. The second phase sets in some thirty to forty days  later when the grubs have been harvested. Amid the din preceding a battle  and with full body decorations, the men leave for the selected tree, while the  women again enter the men’s house for drumming and dancing. Some men  gather more sago leaves, others go fishing, while yet others hunt for baka  peor, a type of yellow finch. The men divide into two groups corresponding  to the two sections of the men’s house. One group goes ashore for cutting  the log, and the other remains in the canoes and prepares for a mock battle  with those who will load the log. The latter approach the tree as if attacking  an enemy (hence the decoration of the trunk). The war leader, carried on the  shoulders of his relatives, calls out the names of six enemies he has killed.  He makes a few chops at the tree. He is then replaced by another war leader,  and so on, till the tree finally tumbles down. The mock battle ensues and  continues until the fishermen, the hunters, and the collectors of leaves return  to the site. The log is decorated anew with fresh leaves, fish and birds. The  main war leader measures the log for the mbish carving. Another war leader  begins hewing at the designated spot, then stops to enumerate several more  enemies he has slain. Another leader takes over in a similar vein and finishes  the cut. [Compare this with the three Kamoro dignitaries crouching near the  </page> <page sequence="9"> X  Initiating young males and commemorating the dead 201 tree they are entitled to cut for the python ceremony, and with the reddish  track giving the impression of a serpent who attacked and swallowed people;  see Chapter II.] Finally, the bottom portion of the tree is marked for carving  a small canoe and a sago dish. (A buttress root is saved for the ‘wing’ por- tion of the pole, the cemen, a general term for any protrusion.) Stage three  involves dragging the logs – a small one inside a canoe, a big one tied to a  canoe – to the village site, approaching the village quietly and slowly; women  are strictly banned. Stage four concerns the arrival of the mbish in the village.  When the women, drumming and dancing in the yew, hear the men coming,  some of them hide along the riverbank, acting as spies. They return to the  yew and report. All the women reach for weapons (spears, knives, sticks, and  so on) and initially pretend not to be aware of the men’s arrival, but finally  begin to throw ashes and lime into the air. The women refuse to answer the  repeated question of the shouting war leader: ‘Who is in our place?’ A leading  woman makes her appearance from the yew and asks: ‘Who are you? This is  the place of our ancestors.’ On hearing this reply the men begin to beat the  sides of their canoes with their paddles to frighten the women. Withdrawing  a bit to allow the women to leave the men’s house, they come ashore; the  women rush to attack them fiercely. Some men receive serious wounds (and  are proud of it). At the end of the mock attack the men drag the pole into the  yew and place it on the bark of a tree. The fifth and sixth stages concern the  carvers’ completion of the three sections of the mbish. The main war leader  begins to chip at the pole to make a rough outline of the human figure, while  again enumerating slain enemies. Expert carvers take over and complete the  outline. The pole is then carried to the ecawor, and part of the yew is parti- tioned off for more detailed carving in relative privacy. The first section of  the mbish to be finished is the mbish cemen, the protrusion or wing. At this  point the men gather to name the mbish after the main victim of a battle or  after a naturally deceased person of repute. His or her relatives offer food  to the carvers and their assistants. They finish the cemen section. Meanwhile  the relatives of the honoured person go hunting for a pig and take the meat  into the yew. The women are invited to share the meat, but presumably do so  outside the men’s house, and this is the occasion of another mock battle with  the men that lasts well into the night. The cemen phase is terminated by dis- tributing fish, sago and sago grubs throughout the village. Then the middle  section of the carving, the mbish anakat, representing a number of male (top)  and female (bottom) figures, is completed. The war leader summons the men  for a headhunting party, while the carvers proceed to complete the lower sec- tion: a small ci and a bino (sago bowl). When the warriors return, they rub the  entire carving with the victims’ blood. Special attention is given to the vital  organs of the carved figures, such as eyes, mouth and sexual organs. More  sago trees are cut down and prepared for growing sago grubs. At the clos- </page> <page sequence="10"> 202 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua ing phase of the ceremony there is massive collection of sago, fish and sago  grubs by men and women in the woods. The men take these food items to the  men’s house in huge quantities. The women wrap the sago grubs in leaves in  their individual homes and then take them to the yew. On this day the men  finish the mbish by painting it red, white and black. Towards the evening of  that day everyone gathers in front of the yew. There is a massive distribution  of food, which is taken back to the individual homes. All then return to the  men’s house to witness how the mbish, newly completed and brilliant in fresh  colours, is carried from the ecawor to the main entrance of the yew and placed  on the floor. Several men rip off a section of the roofing and partially elevate  the pole for display. There is intense general mourning of the commemorated  dead. When the crying has stopped, the men return home to get their drums.  Dancing, singing and feasting go on until daylight. There may be some  licensed sexual intercourse, although Zegwaard’s informants deny this. After  daybreak the mbish is transported to a predetermined site in the sago grove  and erected. The hand of the statue is broken off to prevent the spirits of the  mbish from obstructing anyone passing by. Attitudes towards the dead are  quite ambivalent: a mixture of respect, reverence and fear. Comments Since the Mbish ritual – at least as it is described here – hinges on the spirit  pole, my comparison with Kamoro Mirimu Kame, including its pendant Oo  Kame, and Kaware, as far as the erection of a spirit pole is concerned, will  concentrate on this issue. In both cases, the name for the spirit pole has an  identical meaning. It has a common function, namely the commemoration  of recent male and female adult and juvenile dead. It also shares a triparti- tion, namely a protrusion or ‘wing’, an upper and lower section depicting  a man and a woman respectively, and a bottom section including a pointed  end. Juvenile dead are often represented by carved heads at the bottom of  the wing. There are some Asmat mbish with a representation of a woman  on top. The main figure in the mbitoro of Kamoro Oo Kame is the honoured  woman who took charge of the slaughtered pig (Lagerberg 1956:8). The term  ‘phallic wing’, sometimes used by students of Asmat art, is misleading. The  Asmat term cemen stands for protrusion in general, including bodily protru- sions such as the penis. In many mbish the wing protrudes precisely above  or beneath an explicitly carved penis, or even above the carving of a woman  in the top middle section. Quite often the Asmat top section includes a rep- resentation of the upper part of a man’s body together with the wing (penis)  protruding from his belly or his legs. The Kamoro top section of the mbitoro  does not depict a human figure and consists exclusively of the wing (pinamo,  </page> <page sequence="11"> X  Initiating young males and commemorating the dead 203 ‘buttress root’). Both the Asmat and the Kamoro have spirit poles varying in  size, in keeping with the relative importance of the honoured persons. The  biggest one is placed in the middle of the Asmat men’s house or the front wall  of separate ceremonial Asmat and Kamoro houses. Middle-sized ones func- tion as supports for family fireplaces in the Asmat men’s house. In Kamoro  Kaware similar ones are placed left and right of the central pole in front of  the house and sometimes also against side walls inside. Small imitation stat- ues are used by Kamoro to frighten women and to pilfer prepared food, as  mentioned earlier. As well as winged statues, both the Kamoro and the Asmat  have wingless, freestanding ones, such as the famous statues of ancestresses  in front of eastern Kamoro Sempan Kiawa or Ema Kame houses.7  Along with similarities, there are also striking differences. The Kamoro  mbitoro not only commemorates the dead but is also a major marker of cos- mology. It connects the upper world with the lower world via the world-in- between of humans. The wing represents the upper world. Its central feature  represents the remote supreme being of the sun, not by an anthropomorphic  carving but by an oval or round openwork one, may kame, depicting his abode  (kame), sometimes surrounded by representations of clouds (tami). Next to it  are representations of various animals and objects, which are presumably the  otepe or kata of groups or persons that are ‘of one soul’ with the phenomena  depicted (Coenen 1963:67-9). The pointed bottom section is strictly taboo for  non-initiated males and for women. Underneath it are the assembled spirits  of the dead, especially of the honoured ones. These and similar cosmological  connotations of the spirit pole are apparently absent, or at least not reported,  among the Asmat. The Asmat wing does not depict the seat of the sun; its  varieties of carved spirals denoting the tail of a tree kangaroo, or the spirals of  a nose ornament, are said to connote the nameless ancestors of the organizing  yew. The pointed poles are as a rule not inserted in the ground but placed on  platforms in a vertical or sloping position. Carvings in the bottom portion of  the coastal Asmat and Casuarinen Coast spirit pole sometimes denote other  ancestors in an openwork Kamoro-like fashion. However, often a small canoe  and a sago bowl are depicted. These are absent in Kamoro spirit poles. The  canoe seems reminiscent of the Asmat inland spirit canoe (wuramun). It is  the canoe rather than the pointed bottom which for the Asmat connotes the  underworld: the spirit canoe takes the dead to their abode. So, going from  coastal and inland Asmat to the Kamoro, one moves from the presence to the  absence of the underworld canoe in representations of the dead. On the other  7 For a good, more detailed comparative description of Asmat and Kamoro statues from the  point of view of comparative art in its context, see Pauline van der Zee’s PhD thesis; Van der Zee  2005:418-66.  </page> <page sequence="12"> 204 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua hand, moving in the opposite direction, one proceeds from Nokoro’s canoe- cum-grub-container in the Kaware ritual, via a grub container in the shape of  the bow of a canoe of Asmat Keenakap-speaking villages of the upper Sirec  River, to the simple grub container (samu mini) of the coastal Asmat Yew Mbu/ Tow Mbu counterpart of Kamoro Kaware. A Boasian, empirically detailed  cross-cultural comparison of similarities and differences is required to reveal  the fascinating meanderings of unwitting intercultural borrowing.  The body of the Kamoro carved human figures is hollow. This is explained  or at least rationalized by participants in this way: the ‘real, inner body’ (ndata)  of a person is no longer there after passing away or, rather, after passing on  to the underworld through the upper world. Only the shell (kao) is left. The  Asmat, though presumably having similar notions, do not express it this way;  their carved bodies are not hollow. A paramount feature of all Kamoro anthro- pomorphic carvings, including objects other than statues such as the handles  of drums, is the mopere, the symbol of life and of movement. It also connotes  ancestresses and is therefore a central feature of the two sacred boards of Ema  Kame. It is found on all joints in anthropomorphic carvings: to live is to move.  This motif and its meaning are shared by the Asmat oval or round bianam (eye  socket), though it is not so predominant. In Asmat carvings scarifications on  the limbs are prevalent. These may denote muscles, yuerfepin, apparently sym- bols of power, which seem to reflect the Asmat cultural orientation of physical/ political strength and warfare.8 The Kamoro mbitoro ritual presents a clear dramatization of the resur- rection of the Kaware culture hero Muanuru, the counterpart of the Asmat  culture hero Yenip. Its spirits are also consulted in an act of divination. These  two features are absent, or at least unreported, in Asmat ritual. The Asmat  Mbish ritual is clearly inspired by war, revenge, and headhunting. When cut- ting the tree for the mbish, the trunk is even attacked as if it were an enemy.  There is a mock war between the men of the moieties; the women repeatedly  wage a mock war against the men. The war between the sexes is just as much  a salient feature of all Kamoro rituals. The two societies concur in frequently  expressing antagonism towards the opposite sex by means of mock attacks  (Kamoro akapa, Asmat akapes, both denoting joking and laughter). Akapa, a  mock fight between ‘right’ and ‘left’ men, occurs during Kaware to mark the  start of collecting sago grubs. When attacked, men fall to the ground as if  dead, which might connote war and not just a local brawl. A ‘right’ woman  simultaneously hits a ‘left’ woman with a stick used for removing sago grubs.  This might reflect fights over sago grub sites, also reported for the Asmat.  8 For a clear and convincing case, see oral information supplied by Piet van Mensvoort MSC,  quoted by Van der Zee 2005:447. </page> <page sequence="13"> X  Initiating young males and commemorating the dead 205 Acting out interlocal war, however, does not seem to be a significant feature  of Kamoro ritual.  The Asmat spirits of the dead honoured by the mbish and the spirit canoe  are invited in the end to return to the underworld by going downstream. The  Kamoro, on the contrary, exhort the spirits of the mbitoro to leave the settle- ment by going upstream. The spirits are even equipped with a dog and a lance  for hunting inland. The male participants of Kaware then move in the opposite  direction and go downstream. However, the final destination of the Asmat  and Kamoro spirits of the dead is identical: the underworld. The Kamoro men  who move downstream at the end of Kaware return to the settlement in the  masked disguise of the recent dead, who temporarily return from the under- world in order to visit their surviving relatives. </page> <page sequence="14">  </page> </plain_text>
