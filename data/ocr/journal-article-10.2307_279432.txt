<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CUYAMEL CAVES: PRECLASSIC SITES IN NORTHEAST HONDURAS PAUL F. HEALY The southern border of Mesoamerica is traditionally drawn at the Ulua river of western Honduras, before dipping southward to include El Salvador, Pacific Nicaragua, and northwest Costa Rica. Recent work in the Department of Col6n, Honduras, provides the earliest evidence of aboriginal occupation in the region and extends the established chronological sequence back more than a thousand years. A preliminary examination of the ceramics, and a comparison to other Preclassic sites, indicates that eastern Honduras, despite its later affiliation with Lower Central American cultural patterns, was probably participating in the cultural develop- ment and long-distance trade network of Early and Middle Preclassic Mesoamerican neighbors. Using ethno- historic analogy, the possibility of cacao as a Preclassic trade commodity is raised. Finally, it is suggested that the cultural frontier of Mesoamerica in the southeast be extended for the Preclassic time horizon. THE REPUBLIC OF HONDURAS is a land with an exceedingly complex culture history (Stone 1941, 1957; Strong 1948). Previous archaeological work has shown that this geographically and ecologically diverse tropical region marked the frontier of Pre-Columbian high cultures centered in what is today Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize. The Ulua River of western Honduras is generally utilized as the natural dividing line demarcating "Mesoamerica," as defined by Kirchhoff (1943), and those cultures of Lower Central America (Willey and others 1964:465; Glass 1966; Baudez 1970; Stone 1972). Lothrop (1939), Longyear (1947), and, most recently, Thompson (1970) have detailed arguments concerning the exact placement of the southern border of the Maya; Willey (1966, 1971a) placed the Mesoamerican border on the southeast periphery to the east of the Ulua River but west of the Aguan River. Stone (1959) favored a more easterly position similar to the author's present view for the Preclassic. From western Honduras, most Middle Americanists see the cultural border of Mesoamerica dipping southward to include all of the Republic of El Salvador (Longyear 1966), Pacific Nicaragua (Norweb 1964; Healy 1974), and the greater Nicoya area of northwest Costa Rica (Coe 1962a; Baudez 1967). East of the Ulua-Sula Plain, along the Honduran northern coast, and down the Atlantic water- shed of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, archaeological work has been limited and sporadic (Spinden 1925; Lothrop 1926; Strong 1935; Stone 1941). These few efforts, however, have shown that the Atlantic littoral region, as far north as the Ulua River, was markedly different, and associated, in varying degrees, with South American tribal groups presumably of the "chiefdom" level of socio- political organization (Service 1962:143-177; Kirchhoff 1948; Steward 1948). Indeed, this lack of Mesoamerican-style centralization of power prevented a rapid Spanish takeover-earlier achieved in Mexico-of Central America in the early part of the sixteenth century. During the later Postclassic times, applique and incised-punctate ceramic decorations appear rather uniformly throughout northeast Honduras, along with other southern cultural traits in highland Costa Rica and along the Atlantic coastal margin (Baudez 1970:194). Other hints of South American cultural intrusion into the isthmian zone can be seen in Central American ab- original languages. Caribbean groups such as the Rama and Suerre are clearly related to the Colombian-based Chibcha tribe. In his classic work, Zentral-Amerika (1920), Lehmann classified the language of the Moskito and Paya, of eastern Nicaragua and northeast Honduras respectively, within a South American language phylum, terming them "Chibchan outliers." However, more recent analyses (Mason 1940:74, 1950:173-174; Fernandez de Miranda 1967:77) by linguists indicate less confidence in a truly southern affiliation, and generally see both northern and south- ern elements. Examination of the early ethnohistoric accounts for Central America written by Spanish his- torians similarly reinforces the impression of a basic cultural dichotomy for Central America, noting such South American traditions as head hunting, penis sheaths, beer drinking festivities, sweet 435</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY manioc (Manihot dulcis), and pejivalle palm (Guilielma utilis Oerst) production (Stone 1959; Coe 1962a). All these traits are in sharp contrast, and antithetical in cases, with the Mesoamerican cultural traditions prevalent along the Pacific coast of the isthmus as far south as Nicoya. In the spring of 1973, the author conducted archaeological reconnaissance in the Departments of Colon and Bay Islands, northeast Honduras, for the Peabody Museum Honduras Project under the direction of Dr. Gordon R. Willey. This one-year survey program, financed by the Bowditch Exploration Fund of Harvard University, was designed to locate and test excavate sites, in an effort to define the culture history of a culture area's frontier-in this case the frontier of Meso- america. A previous museum study by Epstein (1957, 1959) broadly defined two late horizons for the northeast: the Selin Period (roughly equivalent to the Maya Tepeu 1-3) and the Cocal Period (coeval with the Mesoamerican Postclassic). Our recent studies (Healy 1973) show that the region was more heavily populated in the Cocal Period, corresponding well with the early ethnohistoric impressions of the immediate area by Hernando Cortes (MacNutt 1908). New data, however, have been found in limestone caves some 13 kilometers south of Trujillo, the capital of Colon, which suggests that the region was occupied by at least the close of the Early Preclassic and into the Middle Preclassic Period (around 1200-600 B.C.), as well. This project information extends the established chronological sequence of Epstein (1959) back more than a thousand years. Most interesting, however, is the fact that the evidence suggests that the aboriginal peoples of the Trujillo-Rio Aguan region were developing, at this early date, more along the manner of the cultures hundreds of miles away in highland and Gulf Coast Mexico than of lower Central American groups so influential over eastern Honduras in later times. Our attention was first brought to the caves after being shown several vessels in the Instituto Nacional Hondureno de Antropologia e Historia by the then-acting director, Professor Miguel A. Rodriguez. These pieces had reportedly been looted from caves near Trujillo several years before, with subsequent confiscation and storage by Institute authorities. Little else was known about the looted material beyond the fact that they were quite unique. Since the Peabody Museum project was interested in this general area of Honduras, and equipped to undertake an investigation, a search for the caves was successfully undertaken in May, 1973. The tiny pueblo of Cuyamel lies near the intersection of the Higuerito and Cuyamel Rivers, along the rain-forested base of the Cerro de Cuevas (Fig. 1). The rivers empty into the 200 kilometer-long Aguan River which, nine kilometers due south of the village, connects inland Honduras (Departments of Yoro and Colo6n) with the Caribbean coast (Stone 1941:39-42). The cave-riddled hill is located in a lengthy chain of mountains, dominated by Cerro de Calentura (1235 m), which serves as the northern edge of the Aguan Valley, a rich alluvial river plain. The river levees today support a sizeable population, which subsists largely on its maize crop, as it undoubtedly did prior to the Spanish Entrada. The modern inhabitants of Cuyamel, in addition to working local milpas, raise chickens, pigs, and, more recently, some cattle. Hunting of wild pig, armadillo, deer, iguana, and jaguar supplement daily farming activities, as does fishing of the nearby rivers. Three apparently little-disturbed limestone cavern sites-Matilde's Cave (H-CN-14), Cuyamel Cave (H-CN-15), and Portillo Cave (H-CN-16)-were explored, with the latter two producing a sizeable number of whole, or nearly complete, vessels. These pieces, combined with those earlier removed and now in the Instituto collection, present a substantial group of well-preserved Pre- classic Period ceramics. The cave group was located at the summit of the precipitous (285 m) hill, and reached only after a difficult hour-long climb from the village. The cliff face rose nearly vertically below and above the cave mouths, H-CN-14 and H-CN-15 opening southward, and H-CN-16 facing west. Entrance through gaping, natural openings in the limestone to the cavern floors-roughly a distance of 15-30m-was achieved by utilizing ropes. Other pre-Columbian entrances may have been used, but these were not discovered. Portions of these dimly lit tunnels, some of which continue for hundreds of meters, were damp and slippery, and exhibited stalactites, stalagmites, and a striking display of natural, rippling calcium carbonate formations. The main passageways, strewn with fallen rocks from cave ceilings, 436 [Vol. 39, No. 3, 1974</page><page sequence="3">x &lt;I 0 c &gt; m r i- 0 m cM m * . :3 0 m r cn 5 n m cn Fig. 1.

A number of auxilliary alcoves and galleries were located laterally from the halls as these twisted tortuously into the mountain. It was in these side chambers, some of which were raised above the passageway level, that the cave floor tended to be somewhat drier. In these areas, especially, largely fragmentary human skeletal remains were scattered about in quantity, with an occasional vessel, atop a fine loose soil. No excavations were undertaken that season, and all vessels were found superficially, in situ, tucked in natural wall crevices and floor-level niches. The cave walls, often covered in large part by a calcareous shell, showed no indications of painting or other artificial modification. Similarly, there were no signs of any constructions in the caves, such as walls. Although it was difficult to determine with confidence, several locales in the passageways gave indications of apparently recent cave-ins. Site H-CN-15, Cuyamel Cave, had a variety of distinctively Early and Middle Preclassic vessels. These included a broken, but recognizable, double bottle, a globular (body diameter 20 cm) straight-spouted bottle, three broken tube or pipe-like pieces (undoubtedly from straight-necked bottles), and two flat-bottomed bowls. One of the latter was a simple open bowl similar to one illustrated from Playa de los Muertos in western Honduras (Strong and others 1938; Fig. 181); the second bowl had an angular shoulder with incurved, fluted walls (Fig. 2a). Other pieces found were a miniature (6 cm tall) bowl with incurved and returned sides similar to a reconstructed bowl from the Olmec site of La Venta (Drucker 1952, Fig. 38k), a flat-based bowl with short outflaring walls (Weaver 1972, Fig. 5b), a crystalline stone "soap dish" vessel, and two poorly preserved effigy vessels. One of these, a human "effigy neck," is similar to those described by Weiant (1943:112) from Tres Zapotes in Mexico, while the other is a small bird effigy (Fig. 2b). From Cueva del Portillo H-CN-, located at the westernmost periphery of Cerro de Cuevas, and near a mountain pass, some 17 more pieces were located. These included four monochrome, globular-bodied bottles with characteristic straight necks, and one bichrome bottle of alternating red and black stripes (Fig. 2c). The bottles ranged in height from 13.5 cm to 20.5 cm, with the largest having a body diameter of 18 cm (Fig. 2d). One btene botellone had a series of thin (2-3 mm) incised grooves running vertically from the joint of the tubular neck to within 5 cm of the base (Fig. 2e). A heavy encrustation of cave-deposited calcium carbonate covered a portion of this vessel was as several others. Additionally found, was a broken tubular spout (7.5 cm long), and some six double bottles, up to 26.5 cm tall. Five of the latter were incomplete but, fortunately, the damage occurred just above or below the midline constriction revealing the distinguishing hourglass form. The complete piece, and three of the broken double bottles, were vertically lobed on the bulge portions. It is noteworthy that the complete vessel (Fig. 2f) is nearly identical to #51 of the Institute's collection of confiscated vessels. One of the most intriguing pieces from the caves was a pale orange zoomorphic effigy with a long tubular neck (Fig. 2g). The effigy form, with three stubby cylindrical legs and wings in light relief, appears to portray a headless bird. Finally, several (four) broken and whole dark-colored (green, brown, black), flat-based vessels were col- lected which were gadrooned with lobes suggestive of common vegetable forms such as the squash or pumpkin (Fig. 2h). The Instituto collection, reportedly from caves near the Cuyamel range, was examined more fully after exploration of the caves and found to consist of well over 50 pieces, including two vessels clearly not Preclassic in date. One of these, a beautiful polychrome, is identical to a vessel found by Strong on the Bay Islands (1935, Plate 1). The second, a Manatee Ware vessel dateable to the Selin Period, is one of the most perfectly preserved examples available of this diagnostic type. Stone (1941, Fig. 7a) illustrates another piece found in the Patuca River Valley to the east of Cuyamel in the Department of Gracias a Dios. Despite these two obviously more recent placements, the vast majority of the vessels in the collection are Early and Middle Preclassic in date. Spouted monochrome (usually a brownish-red or grey) bottles were most conspicuous (Fig. 3a) with one nicely made bichrome (red stripe on coffee-brown) present (Fig. 3b).

Pinfia Chan (1958) and Porter (1953) report quite similar painted decoration from the highland Mexico site of Tlatilco, and though the Cuyamel material has a numiber of unique features, the parallels to techniques employed by Tlatilco ceramists are significant (see Porter 1953, Plates 7a-b, i). Professor Michael D. Coe (per- sonal communication) notes similarities between the Cuyamel vessels and bottles from the Olmec site of San Lorenzo which date as early as the Bajio Phase (1350-1250 B.C.). Double bottles (Fig. 3e), composite bottles (Fig. 3f-h), and flat-bottomed open bowls with flaring walls (Fig. 3i) further the picture of a very diverse Preclassic vessel inventory. The manu- facture of boxes, ceramic and stone, is recorded from at least Middle Preclassic times onward in Mesoamerica (see Joesink-Mandeville 1972, Fig. 2g). Two buff-colored ceramic boxes (15 and 20 cm tall, respectively) with flat detachable lids, were also in the Institute group, and though principally undecorated, these are vaguely reminiscent of Olmec stone altars done in miniature. Two hollow, natural or buff-colored, hand-modeled anthropomorphic effigies were also present (Figs. 4a-b). These sphinxlike animals, with humanoid faces, are very suggestive of the bulbous, Middle Preclassic Playa de los Muertos effigy forms (Popenoe 1934, Fig. 12; Porter 1953, Plate 14). Equally interesting were two hollow and hand-molded bichrome effigies. A very well made red-and-black armadillo (Fig. 4c), and a similarly painted individual with arms and legs done in light relief (Fig. 4d). Both of these pieces resemble, in form, Tlatilco effigies (Porter 1953, Plate 9g; Pifia Chan 1958, Figs. 35y, 37u). Stone artifacts include two crudely made seated (crosslegged) human figurines, each about 18 cm tall, and a white, marblelike bird effigy dish with a narrow wing (flange) and tail below the bowl rim. This piece is very reminiscent of the Miraflores Phase Kaminaljuyu marble vessels (Shook and Kidder 1952, Fig. 50c), and similar to ceramic vessels illustrated from Tlatilco (Porter 1953, Fig. 11). The bowl portion of the vessel had been worn smooth and a hole cut in the center much like a "killed" vessel. Some roughly chipped shale T-shaped axes, identical to axes in a cache found during our survey of Matilde's Cave, H-CN-14, and from sites near the Guaimoreto Lagoon (Stone 1941, Figs. 41e, f) and on the Bay Islands (Strong 1935, Plate 19, #2) were present in the Cuyamel collection. The most interesting pottery vessel in the Instituto collection, however, is a black, polished and excised cylinder vase. Similar black wares, often with line incisions and excisions, have been isolated from Mesoamerican Preclassic contexts (Coe 1961:70-73; Pifia Chan 1958:41; Coe and Flannery 1967:32-35; Drucker 1952:102; Weiant 1943:16-18, to cite a few). More importantly, the incised motif, a stylized jaguar face with tufted brows and open frontal mouth, appears clearly Olmec-inspired, if not actually Olmec-manufactured (Fig. 4d). The Cuyamel vase's rather marked resemblance to Olmec black wares from the site of Tlapacoya (Coe 1965a) suggests a late Early Preclassic chronological placement for the cylinder (see Tolstoy and Paradis 1971). The pieces from Cuyamel, aside from their obvious similarities with such important Preclassic Mexican sites as Tlatilco, Tlapacoya, San Lorenzo, and La Venta, are also related to several Middle Preclassic phases of Honduran sites: Yarumela II (Canby 1951), for example, and Playa de los Muertos, both of the Ulua River region, the latter already having been alluded to (Popenoe 1934; Vaillant 1934; Glass 1966:163-164). Additionally, the Copan caverns (Gordon 1898), located near the famed Maya center of the same name, appear related to Cuyamel not only ceramically but functionally. As in the Cuyamel caves, there was an extensive accumulation of human bone, totally disarticulated on the surface, suggesting that Preclassic peoples had utilized the caves for secondary burials (perhaps deposited after partial cremation). The associated pottery was seem- ingly deposited as a burial offering. The custom of treating subterranean areas and caves as sacred areas often related to death is well-documented for Mesoamerica from the Preclassic right up to the Postclassic (Thompson 1969). Archaeology has revealed that the close of the Early Preclassic and the majority of the Middle Preclassic Period was a crucial time for aboriginal peoples to the north and west of Honduras. The traditions and cultural traits which characterize Mesoamerican high culture were being shaped and consolidated during these periods (Willey 1966:85-109; Weaver 1972). The horizon marked the turning point from simple village life to ranked societies with complex ceremonial centers and the 440 [Vol. 39, No. 3, 1974</page><page sequence="7">CUYAMEL CAVES: PRECLASSIC SITES A B C D E IF ig . i_oI I Fig. 3.

On the Gulf Coast of Mexico, in an environment not unlike that of northeast Honduras, the Olmecs appear to have emerged as the first recognizable hierarchical society with a strikingly far-flung influence most clearly perceived in their distinctive art style (Willey 1962; Coe 1965b; Bernal 1969). The widespread interchange of portable Olmec goods (figurines, plaques, masks, pottery) has been explained by such differing mechanisms of diffusion as migration, military conquest (Coe 1962b:94), and trade (Flannery 1968; Rathje 1972). Following the latter theory, it is not incon- ceivable that a precocious, highly organized system of long-distance exchange had evolved by the Early and Middle Preclassic (Coe 1968:110-111; Stone 1973:253) and stretched as far away as northeast Honduras. Accepting this for the moment, one may be led to inquire just what was being sought so ambitiously at such an early date throughout Mesoamerica and beyond? Baudez and Becquelin (1969) note an Olmec-like presence (Jaral) at Los Naranjos, near Lake Yahoa, in western Honduras. Stone (1957:127, Fig. 84b) mentions the discovery of an Olmec figurine from the Sula Plain of northwest Honduras, and suggests that a quantity of jade at Playa de los Muertos may be Olmec-linked (1973:252). Coe (1968:91-103) has suggested that the Olmecs reached at least as far as the Motagua River Valley in southeast Guatemala, and probably even into lower Central America (Costa Rica) in search of jade and serpentine. The latter com- modity is found in some quantity in later archaeological contexts in northeast Honduras (Healy 1973). But the natural source for this may very well be located elsewhere. Ethnohistorians provide hints of yet another tradeable item produced in Honduras which may have been developed for exchange with its northern neighbors as early as the Preclassic. During the the Cocal Period, northern Honduras was widely acclaimed for its river valley cacao production. Cacao beans (Theobroma cacao L.), utilized as an ingredient in an expensive ritual beverage or as a perishable yet universal Mesoamerican currency, were a valuable and sought-after item (Millon 1955; Thompson 1956). Blom (1932:548), quoting Oviedo, notes that a viable sea trade existed in Postclassic times between the Yucatan and Mexican Gulf Coast (probably via ports such as Cozumel and Xicalanco) and Honduras. Cacao was a crucial commodity in this commerce. In 1524-1525, Cortes utilized Mexican guides and their fiberpaper maps to trek all the way from highland Mexico to Honduras (Blom 1932:546; Diaz 1908-1916). Indeed, in his last letter to the Spanish monarch from the New World, Cortes mentioned that the language of Culua, that is, Mexico (Nahuatl), was spoken at several villages near Trujillo (MacNutt 1908:317), suggesting that the Aztecs were establishing trade enclaves and possibly exploiting the region for its valuable fruit. In Scholes and Roys (1968) and Roys (1972) numerous pieces of evidence of long-distance Postclassic sea trade between the Yucatan Peninsula and northern Honduras are cited. Bishop Landa (Tozzer 1941:39) noted that there had been a history of trade with Honduras dating back to the time of the lords of Chichen Itza, and that one of the Cocom nobles of Mayapan was away in Honduras on a trading venture when that Postclassic capital fell. Columbus, on his fourth and last voyage, in 1502, appears to have encountered one such trading canoe near the Bay Islands, a short distance north of Trujillo, loaded with, among other things, cacao (Strong 1935:9-12). In a recent study of Pre-Columbian cacao distribution, Bergman (1969:94) cites the Aguan River Valley as a recognized source. Though there is still no definite evidence that the Aguan region was growing cacao for Meso- american consumption on such early time levels as the Preclassic, the analogy is not altogether far-fetched. Recently, Tolstoy and Paradis (1971:20) speculated on the Olmec introduction of cacao as a currency to the newly emerging societies in Mexico, and its possible utilization as a lever for Olmec trade and expansion. Many scholars (Willey 1971b; Parsons and Price 1971; Rathje 1972) have emphasized the crucial importance of intercommunication, such as trade, for the emergence of Mesoamerican civilization, with the suggestion that trade was a mechanism which led to nonegalitarian societies with private property concepts, and this, in turn, led to the threshold of higher cultural development. The presence at Cuyamel of vessel forms remarkably similar to those found among con- temporaneously evolving Mesoamerican societies to the north, and its pottery might be categorized 442 [Vol. 39, No. 3, 1974</page><page sequence="9">CUYAMEL CAVES: PRECLASSIC SITES C A B D E 10 I I a .

The existence of relatively extensive Preclassic trade networks has been proven through obsidian analysis (for example, Cobean and others 1971), and recent work in the Guate- malan highlaan nd El Salvador points to the existence of Preclassic groups which may have served as "intermediaries in early trading patterns or ritual exchange systems" (Sedat and Sharer 1972:30; Sharer and Gifford 1970) between highland and lowland and lowland groups. Knowledge of cultural frontiers is an obvious prerequisite to gaining a thorough understanding of the culture history of any region. Culture areas are generally recognized as dynamic in nature, not static (Ehrich 1956). Archaeological research, providing an invaluable, long-range time perspec- tive, brings about new insights and revisions of culture area boundaries as they fluctuated through the centuries. During the Preclassic Period, the Mesoamerican culture area appears to have encom- passed, in the south, a greater area than that previously recognized for later periods. Northeast Honduras, receiving stong currents of cultural influence from both the north and south during its long Pre-Columbian history, might be classed as what Ehrich (1956:8) termed a culture area of "varying affiliation" with shifting cultural ties through time. All of Honduras east of the Ulua River is greatly deserving of more archaeological work. This is especially true in regard to pre-Hispanic settlements patterns, highland-lowland contacts, and trade systems. Until such work is carried out, the role which the so-called "southern periphery" played in Mesoamerican development will remain unclear. Presently, however, a reassessment of this border region's relationship to the emergence of Middle American civilization is indicated, and evidence of clearly Preclassic Mesoamerican sites in northeast Honduras is reported.
