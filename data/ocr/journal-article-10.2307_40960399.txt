<plain_text><page sequence="1">8 Flowers for the goddess? New fragments of wall paintings from Knossos1 Peter Warren Among the Minoan buildings discovered on the western slopes of the city of Knossos, beside the Stratigraphical Museum and some 350 m west of the palace, was one called the North Building, since it lay on the north side of a paved road which ran east-west through the site.2 The road is on the line of the Royal Road and was prob- ably the latter's continuation up to the west.3 Thus a direct route was provided from the North Building and other buildings to and from the palace. On the west the road ascended an unknown distance through the sub- urbs into the countryside. THE NORTH BUILDING Where the North Building stands the land sloped down to the north. The surviving building thus comprises a series of basements when entered from the road on the south side and a ground floor, with a small court and a columned and paved portico, when approached from the north (FIG. 8.1). The northern side of the court and portico and the eastern limits of the whole building were beyond the excavation area. Throughout the twelve preserved units of use, rooms and other areas, there were abundant remains of a LM IB burnt destruction.4 The largest room preserved stood on the north-east (FIGS. 8.1-8.2). It measures 3.80 m+ east-west and 3.20 m north-south internally. The main preserved en- trance was in the south-west corner, from the North Court and Portico, and there were exits into a corridor and small room on the south. Near the centre of the room (as preserved) was a paved dais (1.42 x 1.33 m), standing about o. 18 m above the floor; its irregular lime- stone slabs were set in red painted plaster. Set against the east side of the dais were two rectangular slabs of gypsum, 0.94 x 0.77 m. The slabs may have stood at the same level as the dais originally, or may have formed a very low step up to it; when revealed in excavation (decayed to powder) they lay 10 cms (west) and 13 cms (east) lower than the dais and only 8 cms (west) and 5 cms (east) above the floor. The whole construction looks as though it was a location for action or ceremony, though whether the focal point was the dais, approached from the east, or the gypsum slab element, approached from the dais, remains unknown. Red painted plaster, set on the usual coarse clay plaster backing, was found against the base of the west wall and adjacent floor edge and white plaster against the built units and doorways on the south side, in a raised line south of the east gypsum slab on the east side, and on the inner side of the door threshold on the south-west (FIG. 8.2). Any plaster against the north wall no longer survived in situ. LOCATION OF PAINTINGS Smashed pots, including two tripod cooking pots, two thin baking plates and a coarse ware amphora, a stone lamp, part of a Tridacna shell and other finds, were strewn across the northern part of the floor around the dais (PLATE 43.1). Other pots stood in the south-east corner of the room. In the fill north of the dais and from 0.87 m above the floor down to it, that is for the most part above the broken pottery, there were many fragments of wall paintings, all badly broken, commi- nuted, face down, face up and at all angles (PLATES 43.2, 44.1-3). The paintings were on a thin layer (2.8- 4.0 mm) of white plaster, which was attached in turn to rough clay mud plaster originally affixed to the wall. The distribution of all the main pieces is shown in FIG. 8.2 and their heights above the floor (in Groups 1-5, see below) in FIG. 8.3. The fragments on the west, in- cluding one flat on the preserved top of the west wall (FIG. 8.2 no. 1.8), were highest in the fill, those in the centre were on or only a little above the floor, among and even below the smashed pots, those on the east again fairly high (FIG. 8.3, lower part). This depth distribution suggests that the central area of the face of the north wall slipped or collapsed first, as is natural for the weakest section, with free space for wall debris 1 Mark Cameron and I were fellow research students in Herakleion and Knossos in the early 1960s, and firm friends always. While many of us shared his profound interest in Minoan wall paintings, none could match his depth of knowledge or his feel for the composition and forms of the originals. He saw some of the fragments offered here in his memory and as a small tribute to his standards. 2 Warren 1 980-1, 79-82, esp. 80 and fig. 15. 3 Warren 1994, 194-5, fig- 5 and pl. 31. 4 Warren 1 980-1, 79-82 and figs. 15-52; 1984.</page><page sequence="2">132 PETER WARREN Fig. 8.1.

The distribution, while essentially a continuum along the north wall, is roughly divisible into five areas, A-E (FIGS. 8.2-8.3). To some extent the fragments in each area correspond to the five subject groups, 1-5 (see below). Moving from the west end eastwards we have the following, to anticipate the interpretation of the subject groups. Area A. Fragments with parts of skirts and probably dress, found across the whole area but comprising almost all the pieces on the west (Group 1); one or two frag- ments of garlands (see B) were also found in this area. Area B. The fresco of the circular flower garlands (Group 2),5 nearly all in the central area, with one or two fragments high in the fill on the west and one in Area E at the east end. The main piece, in the centre, lay above small fragments probably with skirts (Group 1). Area C. Fragments with crocuses, other flowers and a stream, including a piece with a painted border or frame on its right side (Group 3); these pieces were concentrated just east of the centre of the north wall and had skirt (Group 1) and garland (Group 2) frag- ments with them. Area D. A fragment apparently with festooned col- umns or a built structure (Group 4) and dress/skirt fragments (Group 1) immediately east of Area C. Area E. A large fragment with sprays of olive leaves in natural size (Group 5), together with dress/skirt frag- ments (Group 1) and a garland fragment (Group 2) immediately east of D. The combined evidence of distribution in plan and in relative depths is shown in FIG. 8.2 and the lower part of FIG. 8.3. This indicates: i) that the garland fresco, Group 2, lay almost entirely higher in the fill than other fragments; since one of its pieces also has part of the top edge preserved,6 we may conclude that the frieze of 5 Warren 1985: 1088, 24 and pls. 14-15. 6 Warren 1985, fig. 3.</page><page sequence="3">FLOWERS FOR THE GODDESS? 1 33 iT ■•' -A., t p ,111 v"*i i*2v5 /•■ 'sss/fo FRESCO |. .. w**"*-^'.-..-t '" -^ ■"' •&lt;&gt;-.f^i' •&gt;.wl-i-?y fc ^^ FACE DOWN ENTRANCE |.: I 1^1 WHITE II ROOM OF THE FRESCOES I plaster '' II fM RED M g/ ili PLASTER CORRIDOR ■» Y3""21^^^ ;":^) 0 , , 1m J Z1^. 5.2 (above).

If it is assumed that the five subject groups, their find spots and their relative depths approximately mir- ror positions in the original painting(s) on the north wall, the outcome of which is the upper part of FIG. 8.3, we have then a physical basis for the interpretation of the whole painting proposed below. THE PAINTINGS7 Group 1. Dress and skirt fragments (FIGS. 8.4-8.10, PLATES 18.1-2,45.1-3) This group comprises most of the fragments in Area A, but also had pieces in all other areas. With two ex- ceptions (1.7, 1.8) they are decorated with a yellow-gold ground colour on which are panels made up of a red, blue, white or gold rectangle (once pinkish red, once grey green) within a black frame. The paints were applied in the following order: first the yellow-gold ground was painted on the finished white plaster sur- face; then maroon red was applied, followed by blue and white, with black applied last of all for the frames of the panels. The paint survives in flaky layers and appears to be secco or tempera. The panels inside the frames, taken as verticals, are 2.3-5.6 cms in height, 0.5-1.2 cm in width. On three fragments they are pre- served in two rows (1.1, 1.2, 1.3); on one of these (1.1) and on two others (1.4, 1.6) the outer panels flare at the edge, with 1.1 and 1.4 preserving a 'corner' with an acute angle. Above or below the panels there can be seen a blue horizontal band framed by black bands (1.1, 1.2, 1.3). Three fragments have an area painted white (other than as one of the colours within panels); on 1.1 it is above the flaring panels, on each side of the horizontal band; on 1.3 it is an area above or below panels, beside the yellow ground, over both of which, yellow and white, runs the blue and black horizontal band; on 1.6 the white area is to the side of an apparently flaring panel. All fragments are broken on all edges and no painted (or other) border survives. How are these designs to be interpreted? At first, influenced by the panel form of buildings near the cen- tre of the Departure Town on the miniature fresco from the south wall of the West House, Room 5, at Akrotiri,8 I considered the panels to be parts of buildings.9 This interpretation is surely wrong; the panels, up to eight in a row preserved (1.3), have no masonry or other build- ing elements attached, as they do at Akrotiri. Their form, colouring, flaring edges with one apparent inset for the next lower row (volant) (1.4), suggest that they are parts of women's skirts or dresses. The horizontal band could then be part of a waist band or division of the dress, and the larger white areas parts of arms held vertical or horizontal. For this interpretation of the panels and bands there is strongly supportive evidence. The magnificently elaborate skirt of the goddess or woman from Ayia Triada Room 14 (LM I B) includes two double rows of polychrome panels, volants flaring at the edges and each row starting further in than the lower edge of the flare above (cf. 1.1, 1.4) (FIG. 8.1 1).10 Another good parallel is female figure no. 7 on the Knossos Procession Fresco.11 Her flounced robe has at least one double row of panels and the serrated profile of volants. Closely comparable too, though with a much smaller range of colours, are the flaring skirts with volants of the women in the LH III Procession Fresco from Thebes (FIGS. 8.12-8.14).12 On a miniature scale females or goddesses on LM I - II gold rings and seals again have just this form of skirt or dress with volants (FIGS. 8. 15-8. 18) and there are other examples in faience.13 Although skirts at Akrotiri lack the panel patterns, several show the flaring volants very well.14 The Akroterian skirts and dresses (plain or divided) and their manufacture, with flares or volants, are carefully discussed by Christina Televantou.15 The horizontal arm position of the LM I B seated female or goddess in relief plaster from the shrine build- ing at Pseira (FIG. 8.19)16 and the arms of the Theban women (FIG. 8.14) are suggestive for that detail of our fragments. Waistbands at Ayia Triada and Thebes are undulating and more elaborate. 7 Thanks to the kindness of Dr E . Bourboudakis the pieces were cleaned and conserved by Mr P. Moskhos in August 1981 and Mr I. Mikhailides in July 1986, each a highly expert member of the Byzantine Ephorate's conservation team for church paintings in Crete. I am also most grateful to the artist and long-time draughtsman at Knossos, Mr J. Clarke, for his sen- sitive execution of full-size colour restoration paintings of the Fresco of the Garlands and the Olive Sprays fresco, after the meticulous actual state drawing of the latter in pencil by Mrs C. Gibbons-Antonopoulos. 8 Morgan 1988, pls. 8, 103, 107 and col. pl. C; Doumas 1992, pl. 36. 9 Warren 1985, 189. 10 Halbherr 1903, 55 and pl.

The position is uncertain, but if we assume that the surviving blue horizontal bands represent waist- bands, the fact that three fragments (1.1, 1.2, 1.3) have white, red and yellow respectively beside or under the bands could indicate that three figures are represented. Another fragment in this group, and just possibly one other, may well represent upper parts of skirts above or between the panel zones. 1.7 has two main areas of col- our, blue with small red spots and red with irregular blue spots (FIG. 8.10). The black lines on this piece could represent dress, sleeve or bodice edging, or even hair. This piece has a small white painted area preserved beside or above the blue area, which could be part of an arm (com- pare the Pseira female, FIG. 8.19) or the body exposed between bodice edges. For the dress area with its small decorative markings and for the superimposed black lines another fragment from the ladies of Thebes provides a close parallel (FIG. 8.20). 17 The other possible dress frag- ment (1.8) preserves simply a red painted surface with a few blue and black markings like the previous piece. With the interpretation of these pieces as remains of women's dresses and skirts can any estimate of the size or scale of the figures be made? The dress fragments, 1.7 and 1.8, are of a size suitable for quite large figures. For the panels we may consider approximate data from the Ayia Triada female. The height of the figure as pre- served, from the feet to just above the waist, is 1 .02 m,18 so she was certainly life size. The panels on her dress can be calculated as 6-7 cms in height, that is a little taller than the tallest of those of our Group 1 . Of course the Ayia Triada panels may have been pro- portionately larger elements of the dress than on ours, that is the Knossian skirts or dresses could have had more rows of smaller panels on a garment the same size as that at Ayia Triada, or fewer. Taking our dress remnants and skirt panels together, we suggest that our figures could have been quite large, very possibly life size or not much less. Reusch restores the Theban women at about 1.58 m, with the panels being 4-5 cms in height.19 These panels are thus closely comparable to ours in height (see p. 134), and are on dresses of life size figures. CATALOGUE (H. = height of fragment; L. = length; W. = width; measurements in cm; all decoration is on yellow ground paint) 1.1 White area (arm or body?) with horizontal band (black-blue-black) above two rows of panels or volants (upper row: red, pink/red, blue, blue; lower row: gold). This is the best example of a panel flaring significantly on the outside edge. H. 13.5. W. 13.4. fig. 8.4. plate 18.2. Just south-west of this piece was another, on a large stone, with all the painted surface gone. 6.0 x 4.0. 1.2 Two pieces. The larger has a red area at the 'top', below which is a black and then a blue horizontal band (split into different levels on the fragment, fig. 8.5); below this come two (possibly three) rows of panels, the first white, blue, blue, white, white, red, red; on the 'right' yellow ground paint. The smaller piece is similar and could well have come to the left of the larger one, continuing the red area and the black and blue band; it has parts of a blue and two white panels. Piece one: H. 20.9. Diagonal 25.0. Piece two: 13.0 x 13.4. FIG. 8.5. PLATE 18.I. 1.3 As drawn it has two rows of panels at the 'top' (upper: green/grey, gold, gold, red; lower: green/grey, gold, gold, blue, blue, red, red, gold), below which is yellow ground colour to the left, white area to the right (with a vertical line division from the yellow) with a somewhat uneven horizontal band in black-blue-black over both the yellow and the white. The fragment could be taken the other way up, with the yellow as part of a dress and the white as part of an arm. Note seven colours used. H. 15.2. W. 11.4. This fragment was found outside the Room of the Frescoes in the fill 2.50 m to the north-west. This find spot could indicate that the paintings were on the north wall of the first floor, but since the wall of the ground floor was preserved only to a maximum height of 0.95 m above the floor its upper part could easily have had some stones and plaster scattered that short distance to the north, fig. 8.6. plate 45.2. 1.4 Three pieces. One: much of the paint is lost, revealing light score marks on the plaster surface, the better to take the final white plaster before the paint. At the top left is preserved part of a volant or skirt flare, or waistband, in black with a diagonal band of white (arm, leg or panel?) and blue (panel?) below; each has thin black lines on top; a small area of pink to the right could represent the carelessly painted end of a red area on the skirt (cf. 1.2); to the side of the skirt is the yellow ground. H. 11. 1. W 16.1. fig. 8.7. plate 45.3. Two: a piece with plain yellow ground, missing in part and revealing backing like previous piece. H. 11.6. W. 16.1. Three: as last, over half the surface again gone, with a blue band (L. 5.3. W 1.8-2.0). The band, on yellow, could relate to 1.3. 4.7 x 1 1.4. 1.5 Small piece, probably found with 1.2 and closely related in decoration. As illustrated it has a red and a blue panel with a red area to the right and yellow ground below. If the drawing is turned 900 and taken thus, with the red area at the top, it is comparable to the main piece of 1.2. H. 6.2. W. 5.4. fig. 8.8. 1 .6 A large piece with only a small area of paint preserved (a great pity), found beside 1.4 on the west. It has two blue panels framed by black as usual, flaring on the right against a white area (arm?). The blue has flaked at the base, exposing the yellow ground undercoat. Traces of another blue area are preserved at the top edge. If the arm(?) were taken as the top, set horizontal, the blue and black skirt elements would be 17 Reusch 1956, pl. 7 fr. 21; cf. pl. 4 f r. 15. 18 Militello 1998, 107. 19 Reusch 1956: height of women calculated from her pl. 14; height of panels from her fig. 15.</page><page sequence="6">136 PETER WARREN Fig. 8.4 (above).

Fresco of the Garlands (PLATE 16 a-b) The major part of this painting, showing five circular garlands of plants and flowers and part of the top bow of a sixth garland, was published in 1985.21 Evidence for three more garlands, one of them the garland of the bow fragment just mentioned, came from fragments cleaned in 1986. These were illustrated with the origi- nal five in 1988, in restoration paintings by J. Clarke.22 The known length of the fresco thus becomes at least 1.13 m. The evidence may allow a further garland (2.7 below), which would add about 0.15 m to the known length. Most of the fragments came from the central area, the main piece with garlands 1-5 (2.1) lying a little west of small fragments of garlands 6-8 (2.5-2.7), with outlying fragments west and east. It looks as though the surviving part of the painting was on the central part of the wall. Since the painting's top edge is pre- served, only 2-3 mm above the top of the garland bows, and since many pieces were high up in the fill (FIG. 8.3), it is probable that the frieze ran along the top part of the wall. 2.1 The main piece, with parts of five garlands.23 H. pres. 14.2. L. 62.0 (the garlands making a restoration to 71.0 certain). 2.2 Found beside 2.1 on the south-west.

Small fragment of the left side of garland 1 (red anemone, poppy or ranunculus). H. 8.7. W. 6.3. 2.5 Two fragments of garland 6 (pink flowers with red petal edges and brown dotted centre, perhaps the Cretan rockrose, Cistus creticus, or Rosa canind), including the lower part of the left half of the bow, and of garland 7 (pale blue crocus with black calyx and long, maroon red stamens or styles; of the Cretan crocuses C. tournefortii, with bluish- violet flowers and orange styles seems nearest, but C. cartwrightianus is also possible). One: 14.7 x 10.6. Two: 5.0 x 2.1. 2.6 Fragment with part of the right side of garland 7 (cro- cuses) and part of the left side of garland 8 (maroon speckled plant, perhaps a creeper), with fragments of the hanging cords of the bow of garland 7, with their papyrus heads. Very cracked and incomplete. H.7.7. W. 13.6. 2.7 Three fragments intermixed with fragments of the River and Flowers fresco (Group 3) east and south-east of 2.5 and 2.6. One: the left half of the maroon bow of garland 8 and the top of the speckled plant,24 with the top edge of the painting preserved. H. 3.0. L. 7.2. Two: very small fragment, top edge preserved, with part of the left side of a garland bow painted pale blue, with black dots on the lower part of the bow only; probably part of the bow, which does not otherwise survive, of garland 7 (crocuses).

Group j. River and Flowers The fragments of this group (FIGS. 8.21-8.22, PLATES 17, 18.3) were found close together in a north-south scatter from the north wall down to the north-east corner of the paved square. They were excavated as three find spots and are catalogued as such. The relation of the pieces to each other on the original painting is un- known, but logic dictates some probabilities, i) The border pieces must have been on the right and the small undecorated border fragment (FIG. 8.21, third fragment down on the right) has a finished bevel on the right edge of the plaster, ii) The main crocus fragment (FIG. 8.21, top) was originally joined to the large border frag- ment; this means that the crocuses were placed diagonally, iii) The large central piece (FIG. 8.21) has stalks and fragments of crocus flower bases; if the string line across the lower part of this piece is taken as hori- zontal, as surely it must have been, the stalks and crocus flower bases run diagonally and may well therefore have come near the main diagonal crocus flowers fragment. A string line across a central area of a painting, with a river beginning abruptly below (or above) it, may seem unlikely. But the fact remains that a river was thus separated from crocuses and stalks on a yellow ground and space was needed for each motive to develop either side of the string line, iv) The original position of the large fragment here placed at the base in FIG. 8.21 is unknown. A second string line, running across near what is here the lower edge, does not help. (The piece could be reversed, the string line becoming part of the one which is now running across the central piece. But in that case, because of the blue stream or river on each side of the current base fragment's string line, there would have to be a second stream extending up beyond the string line; this would create a situation different from the strict gold-blue divide of the present central string line.) A positive point in favour of the approxi- mate arrangement as in FIG. 8.21 is that the river with black 'bank' at the right end of the lower fragment could be thought a likely continuation of the river below the string line of the central fragment, though the distance between the pieces remains unknown. Overall a reasonably close relationship between all the pieces is suggested by the proximity of their find spots. The subject of the painting, conveyed in no fewer than seven colours (black, brown, maroon, red, blue, yellow-gold, white), is therefore an impressionistically rendered stream or streams, blue with inner black mark- ings (rocks?) and black banks or edges, set on a yellow ground with similar irregular black markings. Nearby are crocuses, maroon with large orange-red stamens (Crocus oreocreticus, C. tournefortii and C. cartwrightianus are among the Cretan crocuses with dark sepals and orange-red stamens or styles). The crocuses and their stalks are also freely rendered, unlike the formal clumps of those picked by the women at Akrotiri, Xeste 3, above the Lustral Basin. A second flower is also present, painted blue in microscopic detail just above the string line of the central piece, hanging upside down in rela- tion to the adjacent crocuses (FIG. 8.21. PLATE 18.3). These tiny blue flowers, just 1.0 cm high, have heads resembling campanulas.25 3.1 Found on the north-east corner of the central paved dais. It is placed as the large central fragment in FIG. 8.21 and shows, from the left, the blue painted calyces of maroon cro- cuses; the paint below here has gone but would have had brown stalks on the yellow ground as preserved in the area immediately to the right; on the right edge here are the in- verted tiny blue flowers (PLATE 18.3); below the string line is the beginning of the river or stream, with yellow ground be- side it on the left. 21.7 x 8.0. 3.2 Found just north-east of 3.1. One: the large fragment at the top right in FIG. 8.21 and PLATE 17 (now slightly divided into two, originally one piece), it has diagonal maroon red crocuses with pale blue calyces and orange-red stamens, on a yellow ground with a border of vertical bands (white, red, white, black) to the right.

The fact that this piece and 3.1 were at floor level suggests that the stream or river and flowers scene may have been fairly low down on the wall. Most of the painted surface was gone, yellow ground pre- served on one end, with blue and black lines like the stream on 3.1 and 3.3. Small areas of yellow ground preserved at the other end. H. 5.6.

Group 4. Columns or Built Structure Found beside fragments of skirts (1.2) (FIG. 8.2) this piece has three grey vertical members (or bands if taken horizontally) on the usual yellow-gold ground (FIG. 8.23). One vertical has an area of pale blue overpainted at the 'top' just above a swelling or projection in the vertical. It thus looks as though it might have been a column capital or similar element. To the left, appar- ently starting from the capital, is a hanging, curving band in white with black dots. Bordering the right hand vertical is an upright panel in blue with two rows of tiny white dots which could be festoons, as could the black on white band on the left. To the right of the blue panel was another vertical in grey. The scale of the various elements is much larger than the panels of the skirts of Group 1, while the black on white festoon looks too uneven, unplant-like and narrow to be a flower garland like those of Group 2. It may well be that what we have here are parts of a festooned built structure, recalling the scene of women hanging festoons on columns on a structure engraved on a LM IB ivory pyxis from Ayia Triada,26 as too similar festoons hung from the capitals of columns distinctly resembling ours on a LM pottery fragment from Knossos, with horns of consecration between the columns.27 Among several further instances we note the elaborate festoons hanging from the uprights of the cabins painted on the walls of Room 4 of the West House at Akrotiri.28 While the scale of our festooned structure is too large for it to 26 Rutkowski 1 98 1, 56, 58 and pl. 6,2. 27 PM 1 494 and fig. 353. 28 Doumas 1992, pls. 49-56 and, esp. 59-62.</page><page sequence="15">FLOWERS FOR THE GODDESS? 145 Fig. 8.22 (right).

Although no element on the fragment is preserved complete and the black on white festoon could have been about 20 cms wide, this scale seems rather small for a life-size or approach- ing life-size figure to have been handling it. In this connection we recall that the building elements on the Ayia Triada fresco are far smaller in scale than the richly dressed woman or goddess beside them, unless those elements were part of a raised seat.

Olive Sprays This piece, the largest of all found, was face down at the east end of the room (FIG. 8.2). It depicts life-size sprays of olive leaves on a white ground below an un- dulating band in deep red paint, which is preserved in the top right corner of the fragment (FIG. 8.25, PLATE 19 a-b). Several leaves subtly overlap onto the red band at their terminal points. The leaves are painted in two colours, dark grey and pale grey, precisely to reflect the darker and lighter shades of the upper- and under- sides of real olive leaves. The painting technique was as follows: on the smooth white surface the red band at the top was painted first, then the branches and leaves (some leaves overlapping onto the band, as noted). Of the leaves the dark grey ones were painted first, with the dark grey branches, then the pale grey, overlapping the dark ones in several places. The painter clearly planned spaces for these light leaves in advance. The work is a good example of realism,29 since, although the leaf and branch colours are not wholly true to nature, the upper- and undersides of leaves on real trees are constantly exposed at the same time in a bichrome ef- fect in the breeze. This piece makes a useful addition to the Knossian mural repertoire of olive paintings.30 31.2 x 31.0. FIG. 8.25. PLATE 19 a-b. INTERPRETATION The five 'subjects' of these fragments were all found in a restricted area, towards the base of the wall from which they had fallen. The Olive Sprays, 5, on a white ground with a red upper border, and at the east end of the collection, probably formed a separate painting, though its subject, the olive, is not likely to have been unre- lated to the paintings immediately to the left of it. These, Groups 1-4, all on the same yellow-gold ground col- our (probably plain yellow originally), were surely related and belonged to a single painting. The subject was a woman, more probably women, in polychrome dresses and skirts. They were quite large in scale, very possibly life size or towards it. Near them were life-size crocuses and tiny blue plants, possibly campanulas. Also near were built or constructed elements, uprights which could well be columns, with hanging festoons. Their scale appears to be smaller than that of the women. Above, very probably as a frieze along the top of the wall, was a painting of circular garlands of flowers and plants, also on a yellow-gold ground. The presence together of a well dressed woman or women, flowers and constructed elements (buildings or perhaps an elaborate raised seat) on a smaller scale strongly recalls the great painting from Ayia Triada Room 14 on the one hand,31 and, on the other, in the mixture of plants and streams, the frieze from the House of the Frescoes at Knossos, in Mark Cameron's remark- able reconstruction.32 It is therefore possible that the woman or women of our painting were collecting crocuses from the wild; it is also possible that the con- structed elements, the Group 4 piece, were part of an elaborate raised seat, for which their scale is suitable, recalling the construction shown below or behind the richly dressed woman or goddess at Ayia Triada. Such a construction or seat may well have been festooned for 29 Warren 1995^; 2000. 30 PM III 167-70 and figs. 109 B, no, 1 1 1, 1 13. 31 Halbherr 1903, pl.

Olive Sprays Fresco. 5. a festival. Another great painting, from above the Lustral Basin in Xeste 3, Akrotiri, brings these elements together, crocus gathering and presentation to the goddess on her elaborately constructed and raised seat.33 It is therefore proposed that these modest fragments from the LM IB North Building at Knossos be added to the larger group as an expression of the domain of the great goddess of nature and of offerings to her from that domain. The fragments are, however, far too few for a view on whether any of the apparent female ele- ments was intended as a representation of the divinity. On other paintings the goddess was indeed envisioned anthropomorphically as present to receive offerings of flowers, as in Xeste 3 at Akrotiri, probably at Ayia Triada, possibly in the great Procession Fresco at Knossos34 and at Pseira in the central shrine building of the settlement (FIG. 1.10). At other times the rich landscape is shown without human or divine figures, as in the House of the Frescoes or the blue monkey saf- fron gatherers at Knossos, or in the fresco of the Lilies 33 FIGS. 1. 25-1 .26, PLATE 22.2.

On the Mycenaean mainland the formal procession fres- coes of richly dressed women in all the palaces, for our purposes particularly the flower-bearing women of Thebes, perform in wall paintings the same function as in Crete and Thera, that is they offer a permanent, di- dactic statement on walls to represent an actual festival of flower offerings to the goddess. The place of offer- ing, a shrine with or without buildings, was a liminal zone in which divinity and mortals met.37 Our circular flower garlands, in an upper frieze on the North Build- ing painting, with all the symbolic value of the plants,38 fit closely into this scheme. It may be that the North Building can offer a distinctive contribution. The Room of the Frescoes, with its paved square and adjoining gypsum slabs, which were surely a location designed for some specific action, stands next to rooms containing the bones of children who appear to have been sacrificed (fig. 8.1).39 It has been argued, independently of the paintings in the Room of the Frescoes, that the children were sacrificed as part of the cult of the great goddess of nature.40 The depiction of what may well have been floral offerings in one room may thus have been related to human offerings in the adjacent room, to the same divinity. It is even possible, though quite unprovable, that part of the sacrificial action could have taken place in the Room of the Frescoes, which leads directly into the rooms with bones and many cult vessels, the latter fallen from the room above. Be that as it may, the proposal that the North Building painted fragments belong to a larger, much richer group of murals whose theme was the depiction of a festival of floral offerings to the great Aegean goddess of nature, all permanent iconographic statements of an actual festival, is close to the central argument of Mark Cameron's last public lecture, in 1984, fortunately rescued and ably summarised, with his fine illustrations, by Nanno Marinatos.41 35 PLATE i .2.
