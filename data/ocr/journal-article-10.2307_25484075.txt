Kant on God, Peter Byrne's book on the concept of God in Kant's Critical philosophy, begins by highlighting the tensive nature of Kant's writings on religion. Kant's attempt to vindicate religious faith and doctrine on</page><page sequence="2">980 Journal of the American Academy of Religion practical/moral grounds stands in tension, not only with the limits to knowl edge and meaning drawn in the Critique of Pure Reason but also with his central teachings on morality, specifically, that the moral law is self-legislated and can motivate us immediately, independently of divine sanctions. Byrne raises the long-standing interpretive question of whether Kant's fundamental stance on religious faith accords more with Enlightenment deism or even skep ticism than his explicit statements pretend, as commonly believed, or whether Kant is in fact a genuinely Christian thinker, as a spate of recent scholarship has argued. Byrne frames his presentation of the role of the concept of God in the Critical philosophy by this question, on which he defends a qualified version of the former position. In shining a stark analytical light on Kant's dis cussions of the topic of God, Byrne finds the positions Kant takes on this topic to be often unclear, ambiguous, inadequately supported, or conflicted. However, he also finds the concept of God to be inextricably embedded in Kant's Critical philosophy. Byrne's book has four main topics, which I take in turn. First, Byrne discusses Kant's criticism of the enterprise of natural theology, focusing mainly on the critique of the rationalist proofs of God's existence in the first Critique. He submits Kant's criticism to a battery of objections, the net effect of which is to challenge the generally high regard in which Kant's criticism is held. Perhaps the most fundamental problem Byrne poses for Kant's criticism is to display a tension between Kant's attack on the ontological argument and his systematic commitment to the concept of God as a "faultless ideal" (29). In this attack, Kant challenges the coherence of the idea of a being whose existence can be derived from its concept. But he also equates that idea with the concept of God as a necessary being. Is Kant's challenge compatible with the Critical philosophy's need for the idea of God as an orienting concept? This tension raises Byrne's second topic, which is the meaningfulness of talk about God. Byrne finds that Kant maintains a consistent view on this topic throughout the Critical writings. Transcendental idealism commits us to the existence of a transcendent ground of the order in the world as it appears, but given the Critical limits to knowledge, we can know nothing of this ground. With "God" we refer to "whatever-it-is" that grounds the order in the world as it appears. Our construction of systematic knowledge of nature and our moral striving require that we supply this concept with positive content as required by these purposes. But since the content derives from our human needs, our picture of God is "irredeemably anthropomorphic" (64-68). This position may seem incompatible with Kant's doctrine in the Critique of Practical Reason according to which the concept of God, which is empty from the standpoint of theory and which speculative reason could only pose as a problem, gains meaning and objective validity on the basis of the requirements of practical reason. Byrne finds this doctrine to be compatible with Kant's pos ition on the meaning of God-talk, since "practical interests ... give us the right to assume that there is something corresponding to the idea of God, but [do</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 981 not] give us a picture of what God is really like" (74). However, Byrne's interpretation of the extension into the supersensible domain afforded by prac tical interests, according to which practical interests grant us the right to affirm the existence of God without providing any content to the thought of God, must be at least incomplete, since commitment to the existence of "whatever it-is" that grounds the natural order belongs already to the standpoint of theor etical reason in the Critique of Pure Reason. The third topic is Kant's positive case for religious faith. According to Kant's moral argument, pure practical reason, which imposes upon us moral duties, also frames for us the end of morally motivated actions, namely, the highest good, a world in which happiness is distributed strictly in proportion to virtue. Moral obligations imply the obligation to pursue this end. Given the heterogeneity of happiness and moral goodness, the possibility of our striving to realize the world in which they are necessarily correlated depends on our postulating God as the author of nature and as the legislator of moral laws. Byrne subjects the moral argument to relentless critique, rendering the verdict that "it has very little cogency" (120). The argument is plagued by ambiguity. Are we bound to realize the highest good, or merely to promote its realization; and, if the latter, is the God postulate necessary (?as opposed to being one among several possible conceptions that equally undergird the required attitude of hope)? The conception of the highest good is ambiguous between a future state of this world and another (transcendent) world. Kant sometimes implies that the highest good requires not happiness, but Seligkeit, which consists in liberation from, not satisfaction of, sensuous desires and needs. But if happi ness is not an essential component of the highest good, then the problem to which the God postulate responds dissolves. Moreover, Byrne argues that Kant does not make a convincing case for the claim that we must, as a matter of rational necessity, pursue happiness. Finally, since the reasons for belief pro vided in the argument do not support the proposition that God exists, but merely articulate our alleged need to believe the proposition, these reasons cannot lend rational authority to the belief in the objective reality of God. Though Byrne's critique presses significant problems for Kant's argument, his portrayal of the argument in a highly unfavorable light partly depends on his construal of its purpose and significance. If we see Kant's argument as meant, not to provide reasons to compel belief in the unbeliever, but to show the source of (some significant core of) religious belief in the moral demands of practical reason, then the argument appears in a better light. For example, the last-mentioned objection assumes that Kant's moral argument aims to "produce [religious] belief in the unbeliever (88). But the position Kant argues for implies that the source of an individuals religious belief is not phi losophical argument, whether Kant's or anyone else's, but the individual's own practical reason as exercised in moral striving. Consider also Byrne's challenge to Kant's assumption that only theism will undergird the hope that moral striving requires (93), by suggesting that certain notions in Eastern religion may do so as well. We can grant that Kant underestimates the variety within</page><page sequence="4">982 Journal of the American Academy of Religion the broadly religious outlook to which morality leads, without detracting much from what seems the essential core of Kant's moral argument: namely, that morality requires hope, and that this hope requires religious faith. While each of the several objections Byrne levels at Kant's argument has force against the letter of Kant's presentation, it is not always clear that they impact the core of Kant's teaching. A similar comment applies to Byrne's discussion of his fourth and last topic: whether Kant's religious outlook is deistic or Christian. Byrne argues against the position defended in recent scholarship (by John Hare, Stephen Palmquist, and others) that Kant's religious outlook is aligned more with orthodox Christianity than commonly believed. Byrne argues that Kant's Critical interpretation of religion is antithetic to Christianity, at least as nor mally understood, and that Kant's views are much closer to eighteenth-century deism than to orthodox Christianity (153). Kant explicitly contends that the content of true religion must derive from the rational truths of morality, and thus must be composed of universal and necessary propositions, recognition of which does not depend on historical, positive revelation. Since Christianity is a historical faith, and since its core dogma asserts the dependence of an individ ual's salvation on the miraculous, redemptive power of Jesus Christ, Kant's Critical religion is antithetical to Christianity. Although Kant officially opposes deism, his philosophical conception of religion differs from deism only in embracing mystery and in not ridiculing Christian doctrine. Granted Byrne's claim that Kant's pure religion opposes much of what normally passes as Christianity, his conclusion that Kant's religion is antithetic to Christianity itself goes much beyond this claim. Byrne seems to slide from a relatively weak assertion, which is consonant with Kant's own cautious, some times implicit, critique in the Religion of Christianity as practiced, to a quite strong assertion, an assertion that amounts to a summary rejection of Kant's project in the Religion, which is to show the unity between the morality of pure practical reason and (the essence of) Christianity. Obviously, whether this alleged unity obtains depends crucially on the interpretation of Christianity. What is Christianity, essentially, and who gets to say? Kant explicitly employs the principle of pure practical reason in interpreting Christianity. Byrne derides Kant's hermeneutic as pre-fabricating the unity in question. But if Kant's effort to "read" Christianity through pure practical reason is not under taken as a first step on the basis of which to show afterward a unity between them, but rather as the effort to discover that unity in the first place, then Byrne's derision is unwarranted. Kant's interpretation of Christianity in the Religion is double-edged, since interpreting the essence of the Christian reli gion as motivated out of the demands of pure practical reason pointedly implies that much of what is actually practiced and professed as Christianity is a debased version of the true faith. It follows that one cannot fairly criticize Kant's effort to show the unity by pointing out that what he presents as the pure faith does not accord with how Christianity is "normally understood" or with the Apostle's Creed (157).</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews 983 Here, as in the book generally, Byrne's case has significant force against recent interpretations of Kant's philosophy of religion that claim Kant as an orthodox Christian thinker. But here, as elsewhere in the book, that the domi nant interpretive question is, as Byrne expresses it early, Hare versus Heinrich Heine (3) (i.e., taking Kant as essentially an orthodox Christian thinker versus taking Kant's transition from morality to religion in his practical writings as so unserious as to be hardly sincere), seems to obstruct a more internal, charitable engagement with the fundamental claims of Kant's philosophy of religion. However, beyond the case against recent interpretations, there is much valuable in Byrne's book as a clear, detailed presentation of Kant's various doctrines pertaining to religious faith, coupled with sharp analytical criticism of these doctrines, informed by comprehensive knowledge of Kant's corpus. doi:10.1093/jaarel/lfn061 William F.
