Gasché's is probably the most intelligent, most learned, and most thorough treatment of Derrida's philosophical claims that we have. It is hard to imagine a better study, even by Derrida himself, at least if by "better" we mean a clearer discursive argument, a keener sense of systematic connec- tions, or a superior grounding in the history of philosophy. As we shall see, I am not sure that these are the virtues most appropriate to Derrida or that Derrida's virtues warrant the philosophical claims that Gasché makes for them. But those doubts cannot diminish my respect for Gasché's labors or for the boldness of his project. Most proponents of deconstruction stress its capacity to use a philosophical vocabulary while resisting the authority of philosophy as a discipline: by decentering meanings and shaking up re- ceived oppositions (with their inevitable hierarchies) deconstruction writes philosophy otherwise and sets such writing at the margin of any coherent disciplinary practice, or indeed of any hegemonic political frame-</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 377 work. Gasché argues instead that we fiilly appreciate Derrick's intentions and his achievement only if we see him as at once culminating and reconsti- tuting the disciplinary matrix elaborated by thinkers since Descartes who have devoted themselves to the principles of philosophical reflection: "My study ♦ . . tries to prove that the specific displacements of traditional philo- sophical issues by deconstruction amount not to an abandonment of philo- sophical thought as such, but rather to an attempt at ... an investigation into the conditions of possibility and impossibility of a type of discourse and questioning that he recognizes as absolutely indispensable" (2). The Tain of the Mirror has three parts: the first defines the tradition of reflexive thought that Derrida both negates and fulfills; the second painstak- ingly maps out the systematic core of deconstructive thought; and the third tries to clarify those concepts like "writing," "text," and "metaphor" which Gasché thinks are seriously oversimplified or misconstrued by American literary criticism. He begins with the tradition of philosophy as reflexive thought because its obsession with "philosophy's eternal aspiration toward self-foundation" (12) remains the "unsurpassed principle of philosophy" (64) eliciting Derrida's "investigation into the 'pre-suppositions,' pre- positions,' or Structures,' to which the exposition of this problem, as well as its eventual speculative solution, must necessarily yield" (86). From Des- cartes on, this ideal of self-foundation gets cast in the terms of a visual metaphor. Ideally reflexivity becomes the "medium, the method, and the foundation by which philosophy grounds itself within itself (15) because it provides "the structure and process of an operation that, in addition to designating the action of a mirror reproducing an object, implies the mir- ror's mirroring itself, by which process the mirror is made to see itself." Through such vision the subject can establish its own self-certainty as "the unshakeable ground of philosophy itself (16-17). The roles of Descartes and Kant in fostering this visual metaphor for philosophical certainty should be familiar from Richard Rorty's Phibsophy and the Mirror of Nature, a book unfortunately ignored by Gasché. But Gasché moves very quickly past Kant to Hegel, for it is only in Hegel's critique of Kant's purely formal transcendental reflection that one finds the logic of an absolute and speculative reflection dialectical enough to include both the image in the mirror and its "tain," the non-reflecting tinfoil at the back of the mirror. For Hegel sees that there must be "a third element, which triggers the unifying dialectic between the mirror and its object, as well as between the mirror and itself (21). Within this dialec-</page><page sequence="3">378 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES tic it becomes possible to integrate the distinct moments of reflection into self and reflection into an other into a dynamic unity "created by [and as] the self-revelation of the mirroring subject" (21), which is no longer simply the empirical subject. Gasché goes on to show superbly how this dialectic requires an ideal of absolute reflection that then becomes the conceptual imperative for any future attempt to ground philosophical activity. Basing his analysis primar- ily on HegePs early The Difference between Fichte's and SchelUng's System of Philosophy and then on The Science of Logic, Gasché convincingly expli- cates the argument that because Kant reduced the a priori to the formal unity of the "I think," he both diminishes its force as a principle of origination and "fixes the formal Ego in an opposition with an always unfathomable beyond" (31). For Hegel such oppositions are merely oppo- sites in thought and for the understanding. One must take more seriously than Kant did the deeper oppositions within the processes of thought that require a philosophy open to the principle of negation. And then one must be willing to move from transcendental reflexion to its absolute speculative form which tries to frame the very dynamic of opposition itself: "The abyss of reason, into which reflection throws itself in a gesture of self-destruction, is the medium of sublation of all self and everything opposed to the self, that is of all opposition" (41). Ironically, only this surrender of self and reason to what moves through them as both their other and their forming principle gives access to a totality in which one can think the unity of subject and object by overcoming "the last possible opposition, that of the self to itself (41): "The medium in which reflec- tion takes place, this middle which splits into opposed poles and from which they borrow their meaning, becomes the real subject of reflection. The subject, the spirit or Concept, is what, as pure activity, produces both the opposed moments of subjective reflection - the subject and the object - and itself as the totality of the medium of reflection" (62). Chapters five and six provide a remarkably dense, concise, and compel- ling path from Hegel to Derrida. First we are led through the two basic lines of criticism that can be posed against the Hegelian model of self-foundation by dialectical totalization. Beginning with the sceptical critique, Gasché tries to show that the aporias it generates as logical contradictions in the Hegelian process of self-founding in fact demand renouncing scepticism for a more radical model of reflection. While the sceptics can cogently criticize dialectical ambitions, they cannot treat the aporias themselves as constitu-</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 379 tive for reflective thought (67-72). For that account we need a model of reflection which grounds its processes in a "continuous self-transgression" (72). For the necessary terms of that account one must turn from idealist versions of speculative reflection to those like Nietzsche, Dilthey, early Husserl, and late Heidegger for whom the processes of thinking are necessar- ily and fundamentally heterological. In Dilthey for example the concept of life provides "the non-reflexive source of reflection and self-reflection" which, "as the source of all reflexivity," "forever escapes reflection." Then in Heidegger we get the fullest opposition between Hegelian "reflexive determination" (102) and a "constitutive heterogeneity" (82) which both grounds thinking and irreducibly divides it from itself: "the Dasein does not find itself within itself (83). Finally in Derrida we find reflection having to open itself to "the thought of an alterity, a difference that remains unac- counted for by the polar opposition of source and reflection, principle and what is derived from it, the one and the Other" (102). Part 2 turns to the specific set of concepts by which Derrida proposes deconstruction as his model for a mode of reflection capable of establishing the appropriate heterological framework. This entails first seeing what deconstruction is not. It is not an essentially ironic method for undoing all centered meanings or for revealing aporias where others had found truths. Nor is it simply HusserFs Abbau or Heidegger's destruction because these lack the sense of self-reflexive method and insistence on logical frameworks that Derrida stresses. Yet such precursors make possible the following defini- tion: "deconstruction attempts to Account' for these contradictions by grounding* them in infrastructures' discovered by analyzing the specific organization of those contradictions" ( 142). Then by elaborating each term in quotation marks Gasché provides a very useful image of deconstruction as a coherent philosophical position that is essentially positive, although not necessarily affirmative (154). For in giving accounts Derrida subsumes all mysterious affirmations of some heterological principle like "life" or "power" within the possibility of reflexively grasping the terms of an irreduc- ible doubleness. These terms become clear, Gasché thinks, if one concen- trates on the five infrastructures most fundamental to Derridean analysis, the arche-trace, Differance, Supplementarity, iterability, and the re-mark. Each infrastructure affords a somewhat different principle at work in gener- ating internal oppositions within reflective activity and preventing it from achieving any self-determining unity: these necessarily plural infrastruc- tures "represent the relation - connection, ratio, rapport - that organizes</page><page sequence="5">380 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES and thus accounts for the differences, contradictions, aporias, inconsistent cies between concepts, levels, argumentative and textual arrangements, and so on that characterize the discourse of metaphysics" (147). Moreover defining these infrastructures allows Gasché to recreate a site of reflection whose very constituents at once form a system and suspend the possibility of reading that system as a coherent absolute. Instead the play of the constitu- ents leaves us with something like a virtual or holographic site distinctive to the echoes created by their differences - a site which for Derrida is what the term "literary" best signifies (chapter 10). It must suffice here to say that Gasché's handling of the specific Derridean concepts is elegant, precise, and thorough (for a summary see 223-24). What is most striking, and most in need of comment, is the way that Gasché's concern for speculative reflection leads him to attribute to Derrida a heretological version of a fundamentally Kantian enterprise. He argues that for Derrida the central question for philosophy is the nature of those frameworks that comprise an "originary constitution" (156) at once requiring self-reflection and imposing the need for speculative leaps be- yond the understanding if one is to carry out the imperatives of reflection. But where Kant postulates twelve categories for understanding and sets reasons as its unrepresentable other, Derrida tries to make visible the fundamental duplicity inherent in the conditions that allow us to repre- sent individual identities. The best general model for these constitutive conditions is Derrida's notion of "marginal inscription" establishing both the possibility of thought and its problematic relation to an Other, a difference that is older than selfhood but erased by the postulates of identity required by practical thinking. That differing from and deferring of self-presence is clearest in the difference between hearing the unitary term "difference" and speculating on the semantic and syntactic possibili- ties which the written version of it might contain. In those possibilities is manifest the heterological core of the idea of difference itself. For the full logic of self and other, or auto-affection and duplicity, we must turn to Gasché's difficult and complex account of "general doubling" that concludes the second part of his book: The possibility of dialectically comprehending the opposition be- tween what is doubled and its double as a relation of exte- riorization and reappropriation of the double as the negative of what is doubled is logically dependent on the originary duplication</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS 381 according to which no on can refer in its appearing to itself except by doubling itself in an Other. Since the possibility of all identity is dependent on a referral to Other (and therefore on a limited possibility), the unity between identity and difference, between what is doubled and the double - or, as Hegel would say, between reflection-into-self and reflection-into-other - is derived from an originary duplication which is never sublated in the process of speculative reappropriation of the other. (228) At the very core of the process of identification there must be difference: "in order to be a selfsame origin" a phenomenon "must irreducibly relate to an Other in general, and in order to be the origin of something, it must harbor the possibility of becoming other" (159). If phenomena are to have identities, they require mirrors, but then the identity depends on the terms of the mirror. And the mirror is itself divided between the reflecting surface, itself always divided by the appearances that emerge in it when we look, and the invisible yet necessary tain which we know cannot be subsumed within the play of appearances or the logic of visual identity. Only a model of absolute reflection based on heterology will account for the simulantaneous necessity for and slippage of identity that takes place against the inescapable background of an irreducible Other (251). The third part of Gasché's book turns to those concepts more fre- quently applied in literary criticism. There we encounter the same care and knowledge, leading to an especially fine discussion of metaphor. Yet I found this the book's most disappointing segment. For Gasché is either too polite or too politic to engage in specific critiques of those dominant literary models of deconstruction which he thinks are reductive or wrong in their readings of Derrida, so there is insufficient drama. And while he is clear on the complexities that one does not find in Anglo-American deconstruction, Gasché seems to ignore the deeper question of why quite intelligent people would be satisfied with such simplifications. There are obvious sociological reasons for that, but Gasché has the good sense not to be so reductive. Yet in not really facing these critics' possible interests in other versions of deconstruction, Gasché never confronts the strongest probable objections to his own privileging of "rigorous" speculative phi- losophy as the best context for reading and for applying Derrida (or for connecting how one reads a philosopher to how one applies the work). Let me offer three related problems that I think raise the necessary</page><page sequence="7">382 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES questions not fully addressed by Gasché. First, it is important to note that Gasché's Derrida the speculative philosopher is by no means the only person Derrida offers - nor, I suspect, is the philosophical rationale for deconstruction the only motive informing such playful and devious texts as Derrida's response to Searle. Gasché's project requires his suppressing the willful and the apocalyptic Derrida: at one pole we hear almost notlv ing of texts obsessed with signature and psyche like Glas and La Carte Postale, and on the other we are deprived of essays like "Of an Apocalyptic Tone Recently Adapted in Philosophy," which render Derrida's strange and compelling fascination with an indefinable presence that continues to haunt representation. Such omissions make it impossible to ignore the obvious charge that Gasché tries to provide a coherent discursive and systematic presentation for a style and ideas that are deeply suspicious of all system. For this book leaves us poised between two uncomfortable options: either Derrida is unwilling to accept the degree to which his own thought is systematic, and hence derived from the constraints of logic rather than the imperatives of play, or there is a duplicity within Derrida that must resist any model of the authority of philosophy, even one this attuned to the heterological. In not facing this problem, Gasché leaves himself open to the charge that his practice ignores the fundamental obligation of deconstruction - that it account for the repressed other a&gt; vertly allowing one's own assertions to appear plausible and significant. In Gasche's case that repressed other is the truly Nietzschean Derrida for whom the performing will is the necessary supplement of the rationalizing mind, and from whom a very different politics of interpretation emerges. My final two objections indicate why that other Derrida ought not be suppressed by those with continuing stakes in deconstruction. For each indicates lines of argument making it far more difficult than Gasché assumes to grant Derrida such eminence as a discursive contemporary philosopher. Look first at the language by which Gasché sustains his Hegelian themes of an irreducible doubling at the core of auto-affection, and thus postulates the irreducible excess of syntax over semantics. I think we are owed an account of why it is useful to fpqnulate an epistemol- ogy in terms like "no on can refer in its appearing to itself except by doubling itself in an Other," or "the falling into space of an entity is never accidental - it never happens by surprise - because its inferiority is al- ready inhabited by its outside as the possibility of an outside befalling it" (199)? Such statements can readily carry a Lacanian psychology, where we can point to states of consciousness involved in matters of appearing to</page><page sequence="8">BOOK REVIEWS 383 oneself or being inhabited by an outside. But applied to phenomena in general such language is clearly anthropomorphic. Gasché, and Derrida, seem to think that language must somehow be inscribed within the world in the same way that one might say a desire for identity is inscribed within a self-reflexive psyche. But objects do not have auto-affection, at least in any way that we can characterize. Rather than speak of objects referring or being inhabited by alien doubles, it seems more economical and less confusing to assume that the very existence of objects depends on their having places within our uses of language. Rather than speak of objects and mirrors, a hopelessly positivist program rejected by almost all contem- porary philosophy, we can speak simply of learning how to use the ways that language organizes worlds. Then there is no question of originary grounds; there are only questions of use. And doubling is a problem only when philosophy so misplaces concreteness that it imposes divisions be- tween objects and names which do not correlate with those uses. To question this originary doubling is to question Gasché's entire "sort of transcendental undertaking" (312) because one must become leery of deriving one's terms from philosophy rather than from the practices which actually engage the tests of concrete experience. And that means that the entire edifice of speculative reflection has at best very problematic author- ity. In fact if one heeds Wittgenstein's or Rorty's suspicions of philosophy or, more to the point, the brilliant ironies in the first part of Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil playing on the self-congratulatory blindness sustain- ing philosophy's disciplinary ideals, one begins to suspect that Gasché's ideals of speculation can now be little more than a monument to the inadequacy of Enlightenment efforts to preserve the hierarchy of values developed within Graeco-Christian thinking even as it was demolishing their foundations. For a brief indication of the scope of this problem consider Gasché's clearest claim for the necessity of the philosophical stance which culminates in Derrida: Any attempt to challenge absolute reflection through some notion of immediacy is bound to fail. ... It becomes obvious that the insistence on the immediate, since it is not itself an immediate kind of relating, always already refutes itself. Indeed insisting on the immediate is itself a reflective act. Thus, even this sort of naive criticism of reflection is latently speculative, because it ad- mits as its unthought premise what it tries to put into question: reflection itself. (74)</page><page sequence="9">384 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES This is perfectly cogent within the confines of the Hegelian tradition. But it is not an adequate response to those pressures leading early Modern analytic philosophy and pragmatism to reject that tradition. The chal- lenge to speculation is not in the name of "immediacy." "Immediacy" is a Hegelian formulation that is part of the problem. Rather than speak of "immediacy," which is after all only a philosopher's word that is very difficult to understand in any (other) practice, the various Nietzschean and analytic critiques of reflection speak in one way or another of testing thought by its consequences outside of purely philosophical argument. Yes, such critiques require reflection, but they do not require reflection only as defined within a philosophical vocabulary. And once one tries that move, then it makes no sense to speak of reflection without prag- matic modifiers or to invoke an ideal of speculation that can give this reflection a totalizing self-foundation. "Reflection itself then must yield to the kinds of questioning that demand the thinking take responsibility for some mode of verification connecting it to either personal psychology or public practices. Such thinking will not produce total systems. But why should it? What non-philosophical model of going on requires total sys- tem in order to provide sufficient criteria for particular versions of reflec- tive activity? And, more important for our purposes, what then authorizes our insisting on Derrida's significance as a philosopher, even if he does manage to turn the Hegelian tradition on its head? If one must make a pragmatic case for Derrida, one must turn to the results he makes possible in a sphere beyond traditions of thinking whose authority is so problem- atic. That test will not redeem deconstruction in its Yale textualist forms, although it at least raises the possibility that more politicized versions of its methods like those developed by Culler and La Capra will be able to justify themselves on non-deconstructive and non-Idealist grounds. And such tests leave very much open the case for that Derrida whose perfor- mances require our putting Philosophy itself within quotation marks and suspecting the very logic that Gasché so brilliantly wields. The possibility that we may no longer have a place for a methodology devoted to the self- foundations of thinking makes the apocalyptic strain in Derrida all the more seductive.
