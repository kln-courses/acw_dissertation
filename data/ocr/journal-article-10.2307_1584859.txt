<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS he offers a sound and valuable approach to Philo. His observations on the formal structure of Philo's writings-especially his detailed examination of some treatises-are very helpful for obtaining insight in the structure of the commentaries, which seems at first glance to be rather chaotic. I do, however, have my doubts about the qualification of the Exposition of the Law as rewritten Bible. The Exposition is more than only the rewriting of the Bible: it also contains Philo's own allegorical interpretation and exe- gesis. In De Abrahamo, for instance, Philo alternates the literal narrative with an allegorical exegesis. He also changes the biblical order of the events in Abraham's life. Therefore, I think that the definition of rewritten Bible does not adequately cover the method that Philo uses in the Exposition. Despite this remark I can recommend this monograph to everyone who is interested in Philo's exegesis, which, as we all know, had a strong impact on the theologians of the early Church. With this monograph Borgen has again shown that he belongs to the most prominent Philonic scholars of our time. NL-4206 VD Gorinchem, IJsbaan 175 A.C. GELJON Ren6 Braun &amp; Claudio Moreschini: Tertullien contre Marcion, Tome IV (Livre IV), Sources Chretiennes no 456, ISBN: 2-204-06585-4. Paris, Les Editions du Cerf, 2001, 544 pp. Adversus Marcionem is Tertullian's longest work. It is also perhaps his most important work. It contains unforgettable passages: 'If I offer you a wild rose, Marcion, will you still criticise the creator?' Whereas Marcion was disgusted by the placenta which protects a baby during parturition, Tertullian, a happily married man and a foursquare fellow, speaks about the reverenda opera naturae. He sees a certain progress in the history of salvation, from retaliation to personal responsibility already in the Old Testament (II, 15). In books IV and V he proves without the shadow of a doubt that Jesus presupposes the Old Testament and its God. What strikes me most when re-reading his book after so many years is his phenomenal knowledge, by heart, of the First Testament: the man must have had an iron memory. Moreover, Adversus Marcionem was the main source of Adolf (von) Hamack's influential monograph Marcion, Das Evangelium vom fremden Gotte, Leipzig 19242 and his controversial reconstruction of Marcion's view on the rela- tionship of Gospel and Law.

Today, after Nag Hammadi, it would seem that the Fathers were right when they suggested that a certain Gnostic called Cerdo was instrumental in transmitting to Marcion the Gnostic dis- tinction between an Unknown God and a malicious demiurge. Harnack never told his readers that according to Tertullian, Marcion and the Marcionites boasted to have a perceptive faculty, agnitio, gnosis, by which they knew their new God (I, 9). Moreover, Harnack's amateurish sugges- tion that Tertullian used a Latin translation of Marcion's Greek Luke and Paul was based on such shaky philological foundations that it has been laid to rest by several scholars, recently by Ulrich Schmid, Marcion und sein Apostolos (Berlin - New York 1995). It has been shown that Marcion's doc- trinal interventions in the text of Luke and Paul were minimal and that Tertullian translated a Greek text into Latin. Nevertheless Harnack's book was reprinted (Darmstadt 1996). For all these reasons a new edition, translation and commentary of Adversus Marcionem IV by two eminent scholars is most welcome. Rene Braun, honorary professor of Latin language and literature at Nice, has renewed Tertullianean studies with his book Deus Christianorum (1977). In this he showed that the 'Latin of the Christians' (read: Catholics) as a spe- cial language ('Sondersprache') never existed. The technical idiom of the African Christians, of which Tertullian is the main witness, originated in the synagogue (instrumentum for Scripture); the Valentinians of Carthage, who spoke Latin (not the Roman Valentinians, who like their Catholic brothers spoke Greek), contributed specific dogmatic terms like consubstan- tialis; Tertullian, who was a Montanist when he wrote Adversus Marcionem, was a talented coiner of neologisms, some of which had no future (e.g. prolatio, for projection). In the seventies of the last century, Braun edited and translated into French the first three books of Adversus Marcionem, on the one God, his anthropomorphic Logos and the prophetic predictions of the Messiah in the First Testament. After fifteen years he took upon himself to edit the rest, together with Claudio Moreschini, and it took them five years to achieve the edition of book IV, an interminable writing on the Gospel of the heretic. The translation of the difficult Latin is adequate and elegant. Every chapter is preceded by a summary, a desideratum of the late, lamented Waszink. Difficult expressions are explained. Harnack is taken to task as often as not for attributing to Marcion views of Tertullian (figura corporis 203</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS eius in the description of the Eucharist, is Tertullian's interpretation and should not be spiritualised). A short introduction determines the date of the book, before De came Christi between 208 and 212. A useful survey of the chapters is added. Claudio Moreschini is the leader of the Institute of Latin Philology at the University of Pisa. He is an expert on ancient Christian literature, especially Christian Hermetism. He still practises the noble art of text constitution. As such he edited the prestigious Teubner text of the philosophical works of Apuleius, including the Hermetic Asclepius, in 1997, a high point in the history of Latin philology. In 1971 he edited the five books of Tertullian against Marcion. Nobody is better equipped to give us now the definitive text of this work. His apparatus criticus shows that the days of reactionary text criticism are over: more than once he accepts the conjectures of the much-criticised Aemilius Kroymann (Vienna 1906) and of the idiosyncratic E. Evans (Oxford 1972), who knew Latin and Tertullian so well that he did not need the help of H. Hoppe's studies on the syntax and style of Tertullian (1908 and 1932). I have only one criticism to make: Rene Braun ignores the certain results of New Testament text criticism. I will take my time to make this point clear, because it is important. The 'standard edition' of the New Testament in Greek, Nestle-Aland26, sometimes mentions Marcion in the critical appa- ratus under the text. This suggests that it is a correction due to Marcion. That is completely misleading, because, when the same reading is also attested by the Vetus Latina, it simply means that it is the text in use in the Roman congregation before 144, the year Marcion was excommuni- cated. As such it is the oldest existing version of the text of Luke and Paul. This text, like so many other copies, was good but not perfect. It shows all the signs of having been written by professional scribes, with the errors, emendations and marginal glosses of a normal manuscript. It already exhibits some readings which were later characteristic of the Western Text. For this reason I call it pre-Western. One of its distinctive features was its arrangement of the Pauline epistles. Not Romans, but Galatians preceded Corinthians. Not only the Epistles of St Paul, but also the Gospel of Luke had such a pre-Western text. In the course of the second century almost all the writings of the New Testament were submitted to a thorough revi- sion which ended up in the Western Text. Only the Apocalypse of John and the Letters of James, Peter and John escaped the hands of Western correctors. This process was finished before 180, because both Irenaeus (after 185) and Tertullian (ca. 200) have a full-grown Western Text. It is a plausible hypothesis that this work was executed in Rome, with which 204</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS Carthage and Lyon had a special relationship. Already at that time Rome may have had the authority, propter potiorem principalitatem, to establish the definitive text of Holy Writ as part of the Canon. It was not for nothing that in the end Paul's Epistle to the Romans took pride of place. 1 Marcion's text of Luke told the story of the institution of the Lord's sup- per, Luke 22:19-20, in the usual sequence. It mentioned first the bread (40, 3: hoc est corpus meum), then the cup (40, 4: calicis mentio). Marcion had not the slightest reason to intervene in the text for doctrinal reasons. We must assume that this was the pre-Western shape of the text in Rome before 144 CE. The 'standard text' of Kurt Aland, however, is very different. It mentions first the cup, then the bread, and adds the anamnisis: do this in remembrance of me. Then follows another cup. The Codex Bezae (D), a representative of the Western Text, mentions the cup first, then the bread, and has no anamnesis at all. According to many scholars this may reflect a ritual as was in use in the primitive congregation in Jerusalem where they broke bread from house to house and did eat their meat with glad- ness and singleness of heart, according to Acts 2:46. This would be a joy- ful communal meal and not a memorial service. Echoes of this Hierosolymite rite are to be found in the Edessene Syriac Anaphores of Addai and Mari, in the Mystagogical Catecheses of Cyril of Jerusalem and in the Gospel of John, ch. 13 (cf. G. Rouwhorst, 'La celebration de l'Eucharistie dans l'Eglise Primitive', Questions Liturgiques 74, 2 (1993) 39-112). In the Gospelfor the Hebrews Jesus after his resurrection first of all appears to his brother James the Just and institutes the Lord's Supper with the words: 'Bring a table and bread'. He took the bread, blessed it and gave it to James the Just and said to him: 'My brother, eat thy bread, for the Son of Man is risen from among those that sleep' (Hieronymus, De viris illustribus 2). It would seem that the so-called long recension of Luke is an interpolation from an extra-canonical Judaic tradition, due to a grammati- cus in Rome who was familiar with Jewish Christian lore and ritual. This must have happened before 180 when the processing of the Western Text had come to an end. 2 27, 2: exteriora, inquit, calicis lavatis (Luke 11:39). There is not one of the thousands of manuscripts of the New Testament, which transmits XODETE, 205</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS you wash, for KaOapilete, you make clean. And yet we must assume that it is not due to the pen of Tertullian or of Marcion, because it is also attested elsewhere: 'Why do you wash the outside of the cup' (Gospel of Thomas, log. 89). This is nearer to reality, because according to some rab- bis the inside of a vessel remains ritually pure, even if the outside has been defiled: in that case only the outside has to be washed off. This reading is understandable in a writing like the Gospel according to Thomas, which in part contains Judaic-Christian Gospel tradition. It would seem that an able and professional grammaticus, who was famil- iar with Jewish Christian Gospel tradition preferred lavatis, because it is more adequate. A later clerk may have replaced it, because unmistakably Luke and his source Q wrote KaOapiexre, you clean out. This transpires from Matth. 28:25. Such a harmonisation is quite common in the Western Text. The variant 'you wash' is also found in Tatian's Diatessaron, both in the Western branch (Venetian: lavate) and in the Eastern branch (Persian: lavate). This seems to indicate that this reading goes back to Tatian him- self. This is best explained by the hypothesis that Tatian took a pre-Western text of the Gospels with him when he left Rome, and went to the Orient, where he wrote his Gospel harmony about 170 CE. 3 31, 12: homo quidam fecit cenam (Luke 14:16). Magnam (ig'ya) is absent in Marcion's text. The same is the case in the Gospel of Thomas 64: 'A man had guest-friends, and when he had prepared the dinner, he sent his servant to invite the guest-friends'. Thomas reports that the man had guest-friends, to whom such a treat was due. When he had prepared the dinner (Coptic perfectum primum = Greek aoristus: oTroITGE, punctual aspect verbal). Lucas nos in medias res rapit, he takes it for granted that one gives a dinner to one's club friends. Therefore one should translate: a man had prepared a banquet, and not: a man had organised a dinner. Matth. 22:2 also omits &amp;leya. According to him it was a marriage banquet (yagoS;). However, Aramaic mischtuta means both: marriage feast and dinner. Therefore Thomas, Matthew and Luke, all three go back to the same Aramaic prototype. Tertullian was a good exegete. He saw that according to Luke, the host sent his servant first to the outcasts of Israel (ex eadem adhuc civitate) and then to the Gentiles (nos Jam de extraneis gentibus). No wonder, because Luke, himself a gentile from Antioch, loves to stress this aspect of the message ofJesus. It is quite remarkable that Thomas only reports the calling of the outcasts in Israel: 'Go out to the streets'. According to the author of the 206</page><page sequence="6">REVIEWS Gospel of Thomas, Jesus was not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. That is Judaic Christian theology. 4 27, 9: Quam vero clavem habebant legis doctores nisi interpretationem legis? Tertullian alludes to Luke 11:52: 'Woe unto you, you Lawyers, for you have taken away (ipate) the key of knowledge'. Tertullian again proves to be a com- petent exegete: he knows that in this verse the key of Gnosis, or rather the key, namely the Gnosis (genitivus epexegeticus) alludes to the interpreta- tion of the oral tradition (Mishna) of the written Law of Moses. This made them the legitimate interpreters of the Law of Moses and the oral tradi- tion which was later codified in Talmud, Gemara and Midrash. The Gospel of Marcion, however, states that they have the key. Marcion was no friend of the Pharisees and the Scribes. It is more plausible that it was the pre- Western text of Rome which contained such an acknowledgement and appreciation of the Pharisees. And as a matter of fact Justin Martyr, who lived in Rome about 150 CE, reads: Txa; Kce?I; Xet, you have the keys (Dialogue with Tpypho, 17, 4). The Gospel of Thomas offers the same variant; the Pharisees and the Scribes have received (ekapov) the keys of knowl- edge. Here the Pharisees are not cursed nor are they called hypocrites. This is in complete agreement with the Judaic Christian pseudo-Clementine writings which opine that the Pharisees and the Scribes have received the keys of knowledge and acknowledge, and appreciate them as the legitimate heirs of Moses (Homiliae III, 18, 3). There is a great difference between the Gentile Christian Gospels and the Judaic Christian Gospel tradition as far as the Pharisees are concerned. Again one has the impression that a professional and competent grammaticus, who was familiar with Jewish Christian lore, has at an early date intervened in the Gospel text of the Christian congregation of Rome. These are only some specimina. They show that the pre-Western text in Rome was most remarkable and deserves ample commentary. We may expect that in the coming edition of book V of Adversus Marcionem, the text of St Paul's Epistles will receive greater attention. It may sometimes contain authentic readings which have until now escaped the attention of editors of the New Testament. Apart from these few remarks, this new edition of Adversus Marcionem is excellent in every respect. NL-3722 BR Bilthoven, Noordhoudringelaan 32 207 GILLES QUISPEL</page></plain_text>
