Email: benjamin .cohen @ history. Utah .edu ABSTRACT This article explores the Musi River flood in the city of Hyderabad in 1908. I argue that the flood served as a watershed moment for the native rulers of Hyderabad State (a princely state embedded within the British Raj) to rebuild Hyderabad city, and the river, along modern, Western lines. KEYWORDS River; flood; Hyderabad; India The year 2008 marked the one hundredth anniversary of the Musi River flood in Hyderabad, India.1 Hyderabad today is the capital of the south Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.2 The flood occurred on 28 September 1908 and claimed nearly 15,000 lives and destroyed over 19,000 homes, one quarter of the entire city's population.3 While the flood makes its brief but due appearances in Hyderabad 1 .

The flood served as an engine for modernising Hyderabad's urban landscape, shifting the city centre away from the 'old city' and forever taming the Musi. The Musi River flood speaks to both environmental and historiographical themes that resonate with other such events across the globe and for much of modern history. Floods are generally short events, taking place over a period of hours or a few days, yet wreaking destruction in their wake. In their aftermath, on the one hand, they provide urban planners with a moment in which to re- evaluate and rebuild their cities and, on the other, offer environmental historians a moment to focus on a single event and track its consequences. Examples might include Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans , the Mississippi floods of 2008 , 1 993 and 1928, the Johnstown flood of 1889, the 1890 Prague flood and the regular flooding of rivers in India, like the Kosi River (not to mention the Ganges or Brahmaputra) .5 Along with the Musi River flood of 1 908 , these events share - to a variety of degrees - some similarities. Many floods result in the loss of life and extensive property damage. The natural world and/or governments - state and local, colonial or modern - are often involved and held responsible for failure to prevent the flood or for their reaction in its aftermath. Destruction in urban environments often leads to a moment for rethinking urban design that can yield new and 'improved' plans to avoid future disasters. Floods also cause incalculable damage to individuals' psyches as well as to perceptions held by outsiders of that particular locale. Will, for instance, New Orleans ever recover instance, from 19 October 1829, 'Monday. Owing to heavy floods in the river Musi, the city ramparts collapse, and a panel of the huge Bridge Gate, forced out of its frame, floats away to the Aminul-Mulk's garden.'

While scholars agree that the flood was a critical moment in Hyderabad's urban history, some debate exists as to whether the flood was the defining moment or simply one of many. See for instance Shah Manzoor Alam's work that sees the flood as a pivotal moment compared with that of Ratna Naidu who views other events in Hyderabad's history as also important (for instance, the shift of the Nizam's palace north across the river). Also, see the discussion by Eric Beverly of this 'trans-Musa' making of Hyderabad.

Floods can also prompt fundamental shifts in the locations of power. The ruler of Hyderabad State, the Nizam [governor] and many of the state's nobil- ity moved north across the river, both to avoid its potential flooding and to be closer to new palaces as well as the British Residency compound.7 This marked a fundamental change in the city's socio-economic shape: the old city - once the heart of Hyderabad and home to its urban elite - lost its prominence and the new city (away from the river) became its core. Indeed, the old city never regained its prominence and is now home to many of the city's poorest residents. Upstream of the city the Nizam's government radically reshaped the river's catchment by building large storage tanks to prevent a recurrence of the carnage, thus perma- nently altering the surrounding environment. From that time forward, the flood has slipped into a footnote in Hyderabad and India's history and the river has been tamed to a trickle - the target of jokes and mockery. Below, I explore the multiple meanings that the Musi had for Hyderabad's residents and visitors alike. Then, I provide some background on the city and its politics. The next task is to give a sketch of the Musi and Hyderabad's physical environs before the flood. This is followed by accounts of the flood itself. Fi- nally, we see how 'New Hyderabad' emerged from the 1 908 flood. This new city boasted a tamed river that could now be built upon, as well as a shift in centres of power away from the Nizam's old city to the ever-expanding northern suburbs.8 6. These are just a few examples of famous floods. Several such events have received scholarly attention. For India, see Christopher Hill, River of Sorrow: Environment and Social Control in Riparian North India, 1770-1994 (Ann Arbor: Association for Asian Studies, 1997). For disasters in North America, see Ted Steinberg, Acts of God: The Unnatural History of Natural Disaster in America (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006); Stephane Castonguay, 'The Production of Flood as Natural Catastrophe: Extreme Events and the Construction of Vulnerability in the Drainage Basin of the St. Francis River (Quebec), Mid-Nineteenth to Mid-Twentieth Century ' Environmental History 12/4 (2007). 7.

Before proceeding, a study of a river and one of its floods might beg comparisons with other studies from other parts of the world. Such works might include Mark Cioc, The Rhine: An Eco-Biography, 1815-2000 (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2002); Ari Kelman, A River and Its City: The Nature of Landscape in New Orleans (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2006); Craig Colten, An Unnatural Metropolis: Wresting New Orleans from Nature (Louisiana State University Press 2006). However, I take seri- ously the charge made by South Asia historians that the rest of the world, and especially Europe, should no longer be the centre with which South Asian history is compared. See Dipesh Chakrabarty, Provincializing Europe: Postcolonial Thought and Historical Difference (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2000). Thus, I offer my analysis of the Musi River flood as a moment within South Asia's history that, due to lack of time and space, is examined largely on its own terms, rather than engaging in lengthy non- Indian comparative study. Second, as the Musi specifically, and environmental history Environment and History 17.3</page><page sequence="4">412 BENJAMIN COHEN THE MUSI AND HYDERABAD Rivers, lakes, oceans and other water bodies frequently carried spiritual mean- ings in the South Asian context and the Musi was no exception. For some it was a sacred centre, for others it was a military and logistical problem, while for still others it was the source of folk stories or a point of comparison with other rivers.9 In the realm of the sacred, for Hindus, the ghats leading down to the water's edge were a place both for prayer and worship and also for more practical matters of bathing, washing clothes and cremation. For Muslims, dur- ing the annual Muharram ceremonies, the Musi's ghats became crowded with individuals washing alams .10 Beyond sacred matters, the Musi River's annual rise and flooding during the monsoon also prompted logistical developments captured in folklore. The oldest bridge spanning the river was the Purana Pul [old bridge] . This and other bridges connected the Nizam's locale with that of the Residency and the city's growing northern suburbs. Folk tales link the bridge and river to the rulers at Golconda. In 1578, Sultan Ibrahim Qutb Shah IV was ruler at Golconda. His son, Muhammad Quli, had a mistress named Bhagmati (sometimes described as a courtesan or concubine) who lived across the river in the village of Chichlam. One evening, the prince went to visit his lover, crossing the swollen Musi on horseback.11 When his guards informed Sultan Ibrahim of this dangerous trip, he ordered the construction of a bridge over the river at a cost of Rs. 100,000. Its twenty-two arches have withstood numerous floods , with later rulers strengthen- ing it in 1820 and again in 1908. 12 more generally, are still gathering strength in South Asian circles, my approach here is broad and multi-faceted in hopes of spurring further research in this direction. The field of South Asian environmental history is relatively new compared to its North American and European counterparts. The focus of scholarship thus far has followed themes drawn from South Asian political history, usually focused on long-term policies wrought by the twin 'isms' of colonialism and imperialism. Among others, two introductions to the field exist. See Richard H. Grove, Vinita Damodaran and Satpal Sang wan, 'Introduction', in Nature and the Orient , ed. Richard H. Grove, Vinita Damodaran, and Satpal Sangwan (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998); David Arnold and Ramachandra Guha, 'Introduction: Themes and Issues in the Environmental History of South Asia', in Nature, Culture, Imperialism , ed.

Environment and History 17.3</page><page sequence="5">413 MODERNISING THE URBAN ENVIRONMENT Visitors to the city viewed the river both as a 'problem' and as a component of its beauty. Among many visitors to Hyderabad and the hill fort of Golconda was Jean-Baptiste Tavernier (1605-1689). Tavernier's impression of Golconda and Hyderabad was of a city rich in splendour, comparable to those of Europe. In the 1660s, Tavernier traveled to Golconda and described Hyderabad, rapidly growing a few miles away. 'You cross it [the Musi River] at Bhagnagar by a grand stone bridge, which is scarcely less beautiful than the Pont Neuf at Paris. The town is nearly the size of Orleans, well built and well opened out, and there are many fine large streets in it.'13 Tavernier recounts the reasoning behind the establishment of the city: the river. 'It was previously only a pleasure resort where the King had beautiful gardens, and his wife often telling him that, on account of the river, the spot was suitable for building a palace and a town.'14 By the eighteenth century, the river played a role in the colonial contestations taking place between French and British forces. In October 1798, as Napoleon was making great progress in Egypt, the British and French forces in Hyderabad found themselves caught in an awkward situation. For some time, the Nizam had allowed French troops to stay in the city, much to the displeasure of British officials. In a move to strike at the French and disband their forces, the British marched on Hyderabad. Half the troops were able to ford the swollen Musi but, the next morning, the second half found themselves unable to cross the river as it had risen during the night. Shortly thereafter, with the river receding, the British were able to reunite and surround their French adversaries, thus ending French colonial aspirations in Hyderabad.15 In the early decades of the nineteenth century, Enugula Veeraswamy also passed through Hyderabad. Veeraswamy was from Madras and worked for the East India Company. In 1 830, he obtained leave and began a pilgrimage to Kashi, modern day Benares. Upon entering Hyderabad, Veeraswamy refers to the Musi as the Muchukunda River. He notes that, 'Last year the river was in high floods; the flood waters entered and 'broke up' the bridge constructed by the English at Delhi Durwaza [gate] , in addition to flood- ing several streets in the city in Begum Bazar.'16 Over time the river has held multiple meanings for those within and visiting Hyderabad - as a sacred centre, a logistical problem, a point of comparison with other great rivers and always as a mark of beauty and utility, as the city's most prominent natural feature. Hyderabad city in 1908 served as the capital of India's largest princely state. Throughout Indo-British rule in India (the Raj) nearly one-third of the subconti- nent's territory never came under direct control. Rather, British political agents 13.

At the time of the flood, Hyderabad city covered an area of 26 square miles with a population in 1901 of 448,466 people.19 This large metropolis was the fourth largest in the Indian subcontinent. From the state's inception, its rulers (the Nizams) played an important role in shaping the river. The Mughal ruler Farukh Siyar (r. 1713-19) selected the first Nizam (Qamar-ud-din Khan, Asaf Jah I, r. 1720-1748) as governor of the Mughal 's southern provinces , including the remains of the Golconda Empire and the city of Hyderabad. Over time, succeeding Nizams established themselves as heads of an independent princely state. The head of Hyderabad State in 1908 was the sixth Nizam, Mahbub Ali Khan . He was born in 1 869 and placed on the gaddi [throne] when only two and half years old. In 1885, the Nizam received the full rights of a sovereign. At the same time, from the early eighteenth cen- tury, across the river a long succession of British Residents came and went. The Residents wielded 'indirect control' over their princely charges, operating both behind the scenes and as central players in Hyderabad politics.20 These individu- als participated in Hyderabad affairs to varying degrees, sometimes striking a superior and hostile tone with the Nizam and at others working closely with the ruler to forge a stronger tie between the Raj and its 'faithful ally'. In 1908, the (temporary) British Resident at Hyderabad was Michael O'Dwyer who held the position for over a year.21 Scholars have discerned several distinct periods in Hyderabad city's growth. The river winds its way through this periodisation and the flood of 1908 serves as the defining event, marking the end of one phase and the beginning of the next.22 As the rulers of Golconda - the hill fort home of the Qutb Shah dynasty 17.

He was born 28 April 1864 and en- tered the ICS in 1885. His early postings in India were in the Punjab and in the Northwest Frontier Province. He served as Acting Resident at Hyderabad in 1908-1909. He went on to positions in Central India and in the Punjab. O'Dwyer was assassinated in 1940 at a meet- ing of the Royal Central Asian Society. 22.

Part of the logic for establishing a new city was its proximity to the Musi. As Siddiqui explains, 'the site chosen is the valley of the Musi River which not only satisfied the needs of water supply but also added beauty to the situation of the city'.23 A brief transitional phase follows, from 1687 to 1725, followed by the beginning of the Asaf Jah period - given the family name of the Nizams - from 1725 to 1798. By the late eighteenth century, both French and British forces were heav- ily involved in Hyderabad politics, ushering in the 'Residency stage' from 1798-1874. The Residency compound, its Resident and occupants played a significant role in the state's history. The compound had once been a 'pleasure garden', likely of Qutb Shahi origins. It stretched out along the shore of the Musi, taking advantage of the cool breezes and ample water supply.24 By the eighteenth century, the British had asked for and received permission to use the area for their political headquarters. In its early incarnation, the Residency consisted of scattered buildings that leaked during the monsoon and were swel- tering during the summer heat. From the compound, the Resident would ride on horseback each morning along the banks of the river to enjoy the breeze it provided. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Resident had com- missioned a new building. The flood directly affected this massive Palladian structure, constructed between 1800 and 1808. 25 The compound also contained the homes of the First and Second Assistant Residents whose structures suf- fered heavy damage in the flood. With the British emerging as the dominant European power in Hyderabad and India, technological modernisation began throughout the subcontinent, dominated by the growth of the railway. Thus, the railway stage in Hyderabad's history lasted from 1874-1908. The flood marked the breaking point between this technological development stage and the final stage dubbed 'modern and metropolitan'.26 During the railway stage, as the old city on the south bank of the Musi was already developed, the newer parts of the city rapidly grew from the north bank outward. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, this area - Chaddar ghat - had only the Residency compound and bazaars that surrounded it.27 With expanded commercial activity brought by the railway, and crowded conditions 'Constructing a Capital on the Edge of Empire: Urban Patronage and Politics in the Nizams' Hyderabad, 1750-1950', pp. 6-7 and Karen Leonard, Social History of an Indian Caste (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1978), pp. 140-144 on the growth of the 'new city', i.e. suburbs across the Musi from the 'old city'. 23 .

The river flooded at Hyderabad because a series of 'tanks' upstream had burst. These gave way because at the time the region was deluged with monsoon rains and also subject to a cyclonic disturbance in the Bay of Bengal that produced additional heavy rainfall. To understand the flood thus requires some explora- tion of these interrelated components. Hyderabad city is located in the middle of the Deccan plateau, a large semi-arid zone in the south-central portion of the subcontinent. The Narmada and Krishna Rivers bound the Deccan to the north and south, and the ghats of the peninsula to the east and west. Today, the region includes parts of six states: Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Orissa.30 The Musi River, which bisects the city, is a part of a larger river network. North of Hyderabad, and flowing east across the Deccan to the Bay of Bengal, are the Wardha and Godavari Rivers. To the south of the city and also flowing into the Bay of Bengal are the Krishna and Tungabhadra Rivers. The Musi begins east of the city in the Anantagiri hills where its drainage basin is roughly 860 square miles. Before reaching Hyderabad city, the Musi passed through sparsely vegetated land with little or no forest cover (forests covered only 1 1 .7 per cent of Hydera- bad State), thus the river's watershed was prone to rapid runoff and flooding. Quershi states that forests were 'practically non-existent' in the western part of the state where the Musi flowed before reaching Hyderabad city.31 The river's drainage area was to the north and at one time had some forest coverage but, as the city developed, this area was cleared and remade into parks and gardens.32 While the flood was ultimately a result of unusually heavy rainfall, it was no doubt aided in some measure by deforestation but not to such an extent that the 28 .

Environment and History 17.3</page><page sequence="9">417 MODERNISING THE URBAN ENVIRONMENT flood was the result of human intervention. Visvesvaraya, introduced below, states that, 'No forest however thick would be a complete protection against floods like those of last year [1908] but it will be of some help in moderating floods.'33 The river has one tributary, the Esa, which joins it a few miles before reaching the city. At Hyderabad city, it is 1,570 feet above sea level. Passing through Hyderabad city from west to east, the Musi falls at about ten feet per mile. It eventually joins the Krishna River at Wazirabad in Nalgonda District; the Krishna in turn empties into the Bay of Bengal. At the time of the flood, Hyderabad state had some 17,000 water tanks built along its streams and rivers.34 Ultimately, these tanks were to blame (along with the rain) for the flood. They were not designed to contain the unusually heavy rainfall that soaked the Musi River's catchment. Historically, these tanks - rang- ing in size from a few square meters to a hectare or more - played a key role in flood control and agricultural growth. For instance, Burton Stein has argued that for previous Deccan kingdoms (Hoy salas , Kakatiy as and Vijay anagar) expansion was, 'critically dependent upon tank irrigation'.35 In constructing tanks, early Deccan rulers fulfilled three purposes. As the Deccan is semi-arid, tanks pro- vided water reservoirs used for drinking, washing and irrigation. Second, tanks served as preventative measures against flooding. Streams that received sudden downpours were mollified through intermittent tanks that captured excess water and prevented larger flooding. Yet, this system had a critical weakness. Resting on crystalline rock and situated amongst occasional steep slopes, heavy down- pours quickly filled these tanks and the network of connecting streams. If one tank breached its walls, this produced a domino effect whereby lower tanks also breached, resulting in flooding.36 Third, within both Indie and Islamic practices of kingship, the construction of tanks and other water systems, especially in the Deccan, was part of rajadharma [king's duty] that brought religious merit as well as popular support. Tank building, bridge building and other public works related to the Musi River undertaken by the different rulers of Hyderabad and the Deccan thus served multiple purposes - modernising on the one hand and conforming to more traditional roles on the other. The tank system was arguably developed to store and manage rivers and streams swollen with rainfall. Throughout the summer months and into the fall, the Deccan is subject to the fury of tropical storm and cyclonic activity that 33.

Tropical depressions and cyclones in the Bay of Bengal strengthen the monsoon rains - explored below - over Hyderabad. The east coast of India experiences six to ten tropical storms per year and one or two emerge as cyclones.37 The peak storm months are April and May and then from September to December. These storms can be up to 600 miles wide, travel up to 300 miles per day and reach up to ten miles in height.38 Cyclones and other tropical storms grow out of a warm low-pressure core. Moist air rises in the atmosphere and the heat released results in water vapour condensation. Cyclones produce bands of thunderstorms that yield heavy flooding; such was the case in Hyderabad in 1908. These storms are cyclones (or cyclonic) as they rotate counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere. Winds in the troposphere steer the massive storms that either develop around an eye or remain less well formed yet still dangerous. They lose strength when overland and conversely gain strength over water. Coastal locations suffer from wind, rain and storm surges while hinterland locations suffer from thunderstorms, tornadoes and heavy flooding. Cyclones are related to hurricanes, tropical depressions, typhoons and other storm types, differentiated by their strength and location. Thus the tropical storm or cyclone of September 1908 exacerbated the normal monsoon rainfall. India is subject to two monsoon seasons. This biannual rainfall is a result of increased solar heating over the Arabian Sea and the subcontinent's land- mass. The heating is uneven as the land temperature rises more quickly than the sea. This results in a vacuum over land that draws air and moisture in from the sea. Hie first monsoon rains reach Hyderabad and the Deccan in early June (the official season begins on 7 June). This marks the beginning of the rainy season that lasts until September. The monsoon season officially ends on 13 October. Monsoon rains that begin in May in the Bay of Bengal drop much of their precipitation on the eastern ghats before reaching inland. Thus, within the rain shadow of the ghats, parts of the Deccan are consistently drought ridden.39 The second monsoon season in October and November is less precise and sees the process reversed. The winds blow to the south, taking moisture off the land towards the Bay of Bengal resulting in further rainfall. The 1908 flood was thus the result - in part - of natural processes (the monsoon rains and a tropi- cal storm) that coincided at a particular moment, exposing weaknesses in the systems designed to contain them. 37 . The east coast of India has been hit by cyclones for millennia, yet few of these storms have received scholarly study. One exception is the Andhra cyclone of 1977, for which see Stephen P. Cohen and C.V. Raghavulu, The Andhra Cyclone of 1977 (New Delhi: Vikas, 1979). 38. Ibid. p. 2. 39.

Environment and History 1 7 .3</page><page sequence="11">419 MODERNISING THE URBAN ENVIRONMENT THE FLOOD The 1908 flood was the result of multiple factors. The second monsoon thrust caused streams and rivers in the area to fill. This was exacerbated by a cyclonic storm in the Bay of Bengal that generated bands of severe thunderstorms and heavy rainfall.40 These 'natural' events were overlaid onto human-made ele- ments. The tank system in place, while usually adequate, was at this moment overwhelmed. And, more generally, over time the Musi's catchment had been deforested, allowing a larger proportion of rainfall to enter the river system. Thus , the flood - while historicised as a single event - was in reality the combination of both natural and human activity. To begin, a tropical storm in the Bay of Bengal produced heavy rains on 26 September 1908. This storm system moved inland and produced cloudbursts upstream of Hyderabad. For the previous two years, the average rainfall amount in Hyderabad for the month had been 4.29 inches.41 In the 48 hours leading up to the flood, Hyderabad city alone received twelve inches of rain.42 In the Esa basin, 33.19 inches of rain fell between 26-28 September; in the Musi basin, 38.81 fell; and in Hyderabad itself another 12.21 fell 43 The deluge ofrain caused much of the tank system to fail. As the cloudbursts were confined to specific areas, this explains why only some of the tanks failed and not others. Further, the system had received a thorough soaking in the days before the cloudbursts. Normally, the tanks were able to discharge excess water without difficulty but the combination of heavy rainfall followed by cloudbursts overwhelmed a nor- mally stable and secure system. Specific to the Musi's catchment, there were 788 tanks in an 862 square mile basin.44 The Esa River had 182 of 579 tanks breach for the Musi the figure was 39 of 160. Further, after the confluence of the two rivers, and before reaching Hyderabad city itself, another 49 tanks breached.45 On 28 September, the tanks and streams that were already full began to give way and the river level at the city rose sixteen feet in less than four hours.46 The river reached a height of 45 feet, submerging some lanes and streets in the city's core under as much as fifteen feet of water. 'The city's four bridges were 40. Visvesvaraya, Flood of 1908 at Hyderabad: An Account of the Food , Its Causes and Proposed Preventative Measures , p. 7. 41 . V/ 10/1 200, OIOC.

Communication between the Residency, the Nizam's palace and the old city was disrupted, as was railway traffic between Hyderabad and the cities of Nizamabad to the north and Vijaywada to the east. As the flood began, the Nizam summoned his military commander, Sir Afsar- ul-Mulk to his palace. The latter lived on the other side of the river. Traveling on horseback, he came to the Oliphant Bridge, which up to this point had not been destroyed. However, blocking his passage were police officers with orders to keep anyone from attempting to cross the bridge. In a moment recounted like a scene from Bollywood, Afsar-ul-Mulk, 'represented that his duty [i.e. the Nizam] lay across the river and spurring his horse through the water he cleared the bridge just as a wave which brought down the breached masonry of the Afzal Ganj bridge dashed against the parapet and carried it away'.48 After meeting with the Nizam, Afsar-ul-Mulk began rescue efforts. A first attempt to construct a raft for this purpose was unsuccessful, so the commander enlisted several elephants. The animals plucked individuals from house roofs and cling- ing to trees. In one instance, Afsar-ul-Mulk commanded an elephant into the swirling waters to rescue one Tipu Khan. Tipu Khan was apparently a gentle- man of aldermanic proportions and great difficulty was found in hoisting him aboard. He was however eventually safely ensconced in front of and facing the mahout [elephant driver] and he and his family were landed.'49 Afsar-ul-Mulk's use of elephants points to the value of local, indigenous answers to such dis- asters. Elephants and ox drawn high- wheeled carts have been (and continue to be) more effective in rescue and flood relief than jeeps and trucks whose vital components are easily swamped in high water. At the same time, the Acting British Resident, O'Dwyer, was making his way to the Residency at Chaddar ghat from the more modern and comfortable compound at Bolarum. He describes the scene en route and the unusual actions needed to reach safe ground. 47. 'Hyderabad Flood Inquiry Report 1909* , M.

The fifth Nizam, Afzal ud Daula, constructed the Afzal Bridge between 1859 and 1861 . It cost Rs. 130,814 and created a 'monumental avenue' between the Nizam's Chowmahallah Palace and the British Residency's front gate. The bridge was reconstructed after 1908 and is now known as Naya Pul, or 'new bridge'.

We got on to a railway engine and made our way to the Residency with difficulty.50 Later in the day he recounted, 'We were able with some difficulty to rescue the servants from the Assistant Resident's house by joining hands and forming a line through the flood.'51 Servants are often described as loyal and loveable, yet sometimes frustratingly naive. O'Dwyer recounts one such moment when he rescued a servant from the Assistant Resident's home. 'Among them was an old woman, the mother of a syce [groom], who had clung on to her little pos- sessions to the last. When brought to a place of safety she wept bitterly, saying, "What was the good of rescuing me when you left my shoes behind?"'52 One possibility was that this woman was in a state of shock and the magnitude of the events around her distorted her sense of priority. Another possibility was that this anecdote was made up or a distorted version of some other exchange between O'Dwyer and a servant. The anecdote seems particularly improbable given the general disgust in South Asia at shoes and their pollutants. Yet, for O'Dwyer, a tragi-comic Indian servant was the perfect foil for his heroic actions. As the day unfolded and the enormity of the flood took hold, Brahman priests (among them raj purohit [king's priest] Jhoomar Lai Tiwari) visited the Nizam. By way of explaining the flood, they informed him that the river was the angry goddess Bhavani ('giver of life', a tempestuous form of the goddess Parvati) who must be sent away, akin to sending a new bride from her natal home.53 This moment and the explanation given by the priests provide some insight into Hyderabad's communal (i.e. Hindu-Muslim) relations at the time, as well as larger beliefs. First, that Brahman (Hindu) priests called upon the (Muslim) Nizam is further testament to the positive communal relations that Hyderabad State boasted of under Mahbub Ali Khan's reign. Second, while Hindus comprised the majority community in Hyderabad State, they were the minority within the city, and especially the old city - under the river's siege at this moment. Thus, the explanation for the river's 'anger' came not from the ruling elites' religious background (Islam), but from the Hindu community's own pantheon of explanation and deities . The minority Hindu community within the old city was less affected than the majority Muslim community, yet the former nonetheless came forth with an explanation for and suggested solution 50.

Finally, the river's behaviour was explained by the priests as an 'act of God,' or of a particular goddess, not in terms of rational and scientific reasoning.54 These 'modern' concepts would be employed by the next Nizam and implemented by one of India's leading engineers. Deeply moved by the situation, the Nizam did what was within his power to alleviate the suffering of Hyderabad's residents.55 Known for his religious tolerance and goodwill, he immediately left his palace for the water's edge. He carried with him a gold tray replete with a sari, yellow rice, pearls, red kumkum powder, ornately decorated coconuts and a small oil lamp. These were all the accoutrements of a new Hindu bride. When he reached the river's edge, he made the (Hindu) gesture of namaste , and then waded knee-deep with the tray in hand.56 Legend reports that as soon as the Nizam placed the tray into the water, the flood began to recede. This might be possible if at that moment, the large volume of water had passed the city and water levels began to return to normal. An eyewitness recounted the Nizam's action and the gratitude of the people. 'At the sight of the sufferings of his beloved people, he wept tears of blood. His sorrow, his sympathy, his eagerness to assist wherever he could were such as cannot be described in words.'57 As the floodwaters receded, the extent of the damage became clear. The flood washed away several parts of the city's six-mile long surrounding wall and its ramparts.58 Nearly 15,000 people were estimated to have lost their lives; the exact number could never be ascertained - the event being too large and the number of dead both being high and difficult to count.59 An eyewitness poetically recounted, 'To describe the scene the pen has no strength, language has no words, the tongue has no power.'60 In the wake of the flood, O'Dwyer went to see the Nizam. Colonial conde- scension tinged his recounting of the events: 'I had heard that the Nizam and his Government were overwhelmed by the magnitude of the catastrophe.'61 According to O'Dwyer the Nizam appeared almost shocked into incompetence. 'Communication with the city by boat had by this time been restored, and I 54. Steinberg, Acts of God: The Unnatural History of Natural Disaster in America. 55.

Contrary to O'Dwyer's claim, a note in passing by the Government of India remarks that, 'our papers (many of which were destroyed in the floods of 1908) are incomplete prior to 1902'. O'Dwyer's claim to have saved all of the Residency papers appears then to be viewed through rose tinted glasses of historical hindsight. R/2/69/59, OIOC.

He was at first reluctant to see anyone; but when he heard that I wished to convey a message of sympathy and an offer of assistance from the Viceroy - Lord Minto - he at once assented.'62 From O'Dwyer's telling of events, it was a message from the Viceroy - the Nizam's Indian sovereign - that opened the door. When O'Dwyer arrived at the Nizam's palace, he was about to leave on horseback to inspect the condition of his people and city. O'Dwyer bore several messages and offers, all of which the Nizam accepted. He brought a message from the Viceroy, 4 which cheered him' ; he offered British troops to help remove debris and rescue victims; he obtained permission to apply to Bombay and Calcutta officials to create relief funds; and he convened a meeting with British civil and military leaders of Secunderabad (the neighbouring cantonment area adjacent to Hyderabad) to create a relief fund. The Viceroy and his wife were among the first to contribute to these funds, all of which the Nizam accepted. At the same time, the Nizam's government began providing financial assistance to those in need - explored below. O'Dwyer de- scribed this assistance as 'generous' but himself takes credit for initiating such activity. The Nizam's Government were most generous in their grants of relief; but the prompt assistance received from British India was of enormous value in stimulating their efforts.'63 In sum, O'Dwyer takes credit not only for much of the rescue effort but also for prompting the largest princely state government into action in its own backyard. 'The calamity showed how strong is the tie that binds together the British Government and its "faithful ally" - the Nizam . . . Ultimately, in O'Dwyer's mind, the flood was an event that shed light not on the Nizam's actions, his government or the environment that led to the disaster, but rather was a moment to show the Nizam's subordinance to the Raj. O'Dwyer recounted another incident at the time of the flood. Several major tanks around Hyderabad did not breach .As the waters receded, one Durga Parshad and some labourers were shoring up the leaky banks of the Jedi Mutla Dam. This dam held water in a lake that supplied Secunderabad. Had it given way, Hyderabad and much of Secunderabad would have been decimated. However, Parshad's courage comes to us through the lens of O'Dwyer's recollections. Not surprisingly, it is O'Dwyer's own efforts and those of the British civil and military officers at Hyderabad and Secunderabad that come to take pride of place in this event. O'Dwyer begins, 'A loyal little Hindu sub-overseer - Durga Parshad by name - with a dozen coolies was trying to stop the breaches! It had not occurred to him to ask for help.'65 That Parshad was 'little' could refer to his physical size or his rank within the government, yet either interpretation is rife with condescension. Further, that Parshad had not contacted superiors for help is attributed to it 'not occurring to him' but contact could have easily 62. Ibid. p. 144. 63. Ibid. p. 144. 64. Ibid. p. 145. 65.

O'Dwyer then turns, quickly, away from Parshad's courage to his own action, thus shifting away much of the credit due to Parshad. I galloped back to Bolarum Cantonment, found Major Harbord, a Staff Officer, on his way to office, and asked him to turn out all the Sappers and other troops available to tackle the breaches. Within an hour, Colonel Hardy of the 97th Dec- can Infantry had all his battalion under way; Sappers and other units followed. General Sir F. Campbell, commanding the station, with Colonel Hardy, spent the day on the dam with a couple of thousand men, expert engineers were called in; tens of thousands of sandbags were crammed into the breaches; thousands of tons of stone were dropped in to strengthen the weak places; the troops worked like Trojans, and at the end of three days the breaches were closed and the dam made secure, at least for the time being.66 The initial wave of responses to the flood by the Nizam and his government took both official and non-official forms. The government and outsiders con- tributed to relief efforts, while the Nizam himself dipped into his own personal wealth and added to the fund. A total of Rs. 1 ,570,740 was collected towards relief efforts. Of this, the government contributed Rs. 500,000 while the Nizam added Rs. 100,000 from his private wealth.67 The remaining funds came from beyond Hyderabad. The government spent the relief fund both on the physical needs of the flood victims and mediating the social side of the disaster. It spent Rs . 1 ,009 , 1 77 on rebuilding the homes of those affected. In addition , the government spent a further Rs. 202,190 on needs such as grants for marriages (many were planned but disrupted by the flood), books for students, the reestablishment of shops and the purchase of home utensils. Other needs were also addressed: for instance, the government spent a further Rs. 17,849 on pensions for those who would benefit.68 Two of Hyderabad's major bridges had suffered serious damage in the flood and required considerable repair. The Chaddar ghat and Afzalganj bridges required Rs. 496,947 in repair, the former taking Rs 214,130 and the latter Rs. 282, 817.69 The government took further steps to aid the flood victims through the quick passage of two legislative acts. The Hyderabad Legislative Council passed the Act for the Protection of the Property of Rood-stricken Debtors and the Act for the Protection of Houses Damaged by the Roods.70 The Nizam ordered many of his private palaces opened to the public. These included the Panch Mahalla and Purana Haveli palaces. In some of his 66. Ibid. p. 143. 67. V/10/1200, OIOC.

To feed the masses, the Nizam had ten kitchens running that fed 625,356 people, costing Rs. 37,894.71 Specialised relief groups also formed. For women, Mrs. Haidri and Mrs. Sarojini Naidu (of nationalist fame) as well as Mrs. C. Walker and Mrs. Humayun Mirza created a separate relief committee. These women distributed food and clothing and worked closely with women in purdah who required extra discretion.72 MODERNISATION AND THE 'NEW HYDERABAD' Roods in urban areas generate a two-stage response. In the initial aftermath, local and national officials concentrate on search and rescue of human life and establishing relief for victims. The second stage concerns rebuilding and the inevitable efforts to avoid a future disaster. Such a pattern is visible in events across the globe, from colonial Hyderabad to modern New Orleans. For Hydera- bad, a modernising spirit infused the answers put forth and implemented in the rebuilding stage. Hyderabad and India's other princely states were frequently criticised for being 'despotic,' 'Oriental' and 'ancient.' These characterisations put forth by the colonial government created a space for Hyderabad - in the wake of the flood - to take steps towards 'modernising' its future vis-a-vis the Musi. Yet, as a princely state under the Nizam's control, the response by the Nizam and his government was neither purely 'modern' nor 'ancient.' Rather it was a hybrid response, combining the Nizam, who represented all that was 'ancient' and 'Oriental' , with efforts that saw the Hyderabad that emerged from the flood projected as 'new' and 'modern'. After the flood, the Hyderabad Government embarked on a series of changes that would prevent a future disaster. Unfurled over time, these changes affected the natural environment that surrounded the Musi as well as the human environ- ment of Hyderabad city. Both sets of changes were infused with a new sense of modernisation. As Narayani Gupta has noted, by the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, Indian rulers and officials began to adopt western , British views that their Indian towns needed refurbishment along the 'cleaner' , 'tidier' lines of the British cantonments. Hyderabad residents needed only have looked north to the Secunderabad cantonment for an example.73 Such western and modernising trends were occurring elsewhere: for instance, as Howard Spodek has shown in Saurashtra with the coming of independence, elites remade their urban centres 7 1 .

At Hyderabad, to help craft a plan for a 'new' city not subject to the Musi's fury, the Nizam brought in outside help . The government employed Mokshagun- dam Visvesvaraya, B.A., L.C.E., M.I.C.E., C.I.E. for six months to draw up a report with suggestions to avoid future flooding.75 Employing Visvesvaraya and adopting his suggestions continued a pattern of modernisation. Visvesvaraya was a product of British India and western concepts of urban design and main- tenance; he was both palatable to the Nizam as a fellow Indian and to British officials as one with European training. Visvesvaraya was well qualified for the task as he combined technical experience with service in a princely state. He had held positions within India as Superintending Engineer within the Bombay Irrigation Department and came to Hyderabad State while holding the position of Dewan of Mysore State. Visvesvaraya made suggestions along three axes: first, to help in the reconstruction of the city ; second, to draft proposals to avoid future flooding; and third, to draft a drainage system for parts of the old city as well as Chaddar ghat.76 Visvesvaraya's suggestions included the construc- tion of two tanks above Hyderabad city to hold back the Musi and Esa Rivers. These projects would cost over Rs. 10,000,000.77 The major tank was Osman Sagar completed in 1920, now better known as Gandipet. This tank both served to prevent future floods and provided clean drinking water to Hyderabad and Secunderabad. It had a retaining wall some 120 feet high and served as the drainage basin for nearly 250 square miles.78 As Hyderabad State moved to project itself as a 'modern' state, the construction of this dam was viewed as a significant technological step forward. The Hyderabad Bulletin reported that modern construction techniques were being employed, including electric stone crushers and mortar mixers as well as cranes, winches and other equipment.79 To its south is the larger Himayat Sagar tank, controlling the flow of the Esa River, constructed in 1927. 80 Visvesvaraya concluded that his suggestions were, 74.

Working with the Nizam and following suggestions made by Visvesvaraya, a new City Improvement Board in 1912 mandated sweeping changes in the area along the Musi. Urged on by the British Residents, the Nizam agreed to the demolition of congested parts of the city that had suffered under the flood in order to make way for redevelopment and the growth of a 'new' Hyderabad. Thus, the population of wards in the old city that were affected by the flood dramatically decreased. Ward IV of the city that lay within the old city walls decreased in population by 22.6 per cent in the decade between 1901 and 1911. Adjacent to this area, Ward X at Chaddar ghat saw its population decrease by 14.7 per cent.83 The river's banks between the Chaddar ghat bridge and Purana Pul, where the loss of life had been greatest, were raised by thirty feet and lined with stone.84 In addition, limitations were put on development along the Musi, both balancing the need for growth and remaining wary of the river's potential for flood.85 The net result of these actions was that a new riverfront emerged in the heart of the city, lined with parks and government buildings.86 In 1916 and 1918 Os- man Ali Khan had the city's High Courts and City College constructed along the Musi's south bank where the flood had once decimated neighbourhoods. Along the north bank, the Osmania Hospital (1925) and Asafiya Library (1931) were added to the city's growing list of government buildings. Speaking in 1930 at Caxton Hall, Westminster, Nawab Muhammad Akbar Hydari, a Minister of Hyderabad State, boasted of the changes that had been made both to the river and to the city in the years after the flood: 'The river has been embanked, stately buildings in the Moghal style flank either bank, with Persian gardens and running fountains in the foreground.' Then, Hydari went on to make a comparison that his London audience would likely know well and appreciate. From 191 1 , the city of New Delhi had risen from a grassy ridge to 8 1 .

'There has been, I believe, no such building in India with the exception of New Delhi in modern times, and I quite frankly prefer New Hyderabad to New Delhi.'88 Hy- dari's opinion encapsulates a general feeling that in post-flood Hyderabad, the new and the modern were desirable and achievable by taming the river through technology and shifting the core of the city to a new centre out of harm's way.89 The modernising spirit that infused changes to the Musi and its environs helped cement a permanent shift of the city's power centres north. This shift had begun with the construction of the British Residency on the north side of the Musi. Around the Residency new bazaars formed and many of the city's elites constructed palaces in this area to be closer to this centre of power. After the flood, a further shift north occurred, first because a section of the old city's population was displaced from the Musi's banks and second because elites - including the Nizam himself - did not want to live within the river's striking distance. Coupled with this underlying and unnecessary fear (the river never flooded again) was the desire to construct newer and more 'modern' palaces and structures to the north. The Musi River flood was not the sole factor contribut- ing to the greater shifts that took place within Hyderabad city. As roads devel- oped, automobiles shortened distances between palaces, parks and bazaars and Hyderabad's elites moved further away from the cramped old city. The river's flood only accentuated this process. Perhaps the most ambitious development in this new direction was the construction of Osmania University Arts College in 1937, far from the Musi and thus cementing a permanent shift away from the river's edge.90 CONCLUSION The Hyderabad at which Tavernier once marvelled, the Hyderabad of the Nizam Mahbub Ali Khan and the Hyderabad with a beautiful river gracing its edges are gone. Now known more for its high-tech identity ('Cyberabad') and for its outbursts of communal violence, the city and the river simultaneously slump towards decay and rush towards hyper-modernity. Of the former, the Musi is a poignant example. Changes to the river's catchment through increasing de- velopment, changes to the river's flow by the use of tanks and changes to the 87.

While the volume of the river has been controlled, and no further floods have occurred, pollutants from human activity have continued to be dumped into the river unabated. The river is unable to adequately carry off these toxins, leading to a sludgy sewer-like composition along the banks, with what water does make it beyond Hyderabad city being extremely polluted.91 Much of the water captured upstream is diverted for agricultural use, greatly reducing the volume of water for those dependent on the river downstream of Hyderabad. In the summer, a hundred per cent of the Musi's flow comprises sewage from Hyderabad and Secunderabad. This waste water makes the Musi an open sewer but also provides a reliable source of irrigation for agriculturalists who squat along the river's course and plant grass to feed water buffalo.92 Indian psychoanalyst Sudhir Kakar, writing about the city, remarks, The Musi river is now a stinking sewer without the sewer's saving grace of flowing water which at least keeps the garbage moving. It is but a marshy tract between the old and new cities, with slime-covered puddles and a sewage-borne creep- ing, crawling, and buzzing life which, to me, makes Hyderabad the mosquito capital of India.'93 Thus, Visvesvaraya and Osman Ali Khan's plan for a beautiful city growing along a tamed river has somewhat gone awry. The river no longer floods but the very control exerted over its rampages has led to the opposite effect: a river with little or no water passing through a city that holds its nose when downwind. Thus, while the Musi River flood of 1908 might be seen as a 'typical' event with somewhat well-trodden outcomes, a lesson to be learned is evident in that over-engineering - fixing a 'natural' problem too well - can have unforeseen and unwanted consequences.
