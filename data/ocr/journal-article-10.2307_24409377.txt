There follow twenty-one poems of different lengths and in a variety of metres. In 1578 a posthumous edition of Belleau's Oeuvres poétiques was published in two volumes by his friends; the Pierres precieuses were placed at the beginning of volume I - a posi tion that reflects his friends' high opinion of the collection.2 The later ver sion embraces ten more poems on precious stones, a versified rendering by Belleau of the 'Discours', and an introductory poem entitled 'Prométhée premier inventeur des Anneaux et de l'enchasseure des Pier res'.3 The general title of the collection emphasizes its novelty (nouveaux eschanges)·, and Belleau opens the first poem in the 1576 edition, 'L'Améthyste', by pointing to original aspects of his work: he echoes Manilius's Astronomicon and Ronsard's Hymne de la Mort and contrasts himself with various ancient writers. Innovation is again the keynote of the address to Henri III, in both editions: the poet speaks of his 'nouvelle invention d'escrire des Pierres, tantost les déguisant sous une feinte métamorphose, tantost les faisant parler, et quelquefois les animant de passions amoureuses et autres affections secrètes, sans toutesfois oublier leur force, ny leur propriété particulière' (11. 17-22, pp. 4-5).4 This article will explore some of the implications of this statement by examining three I wish to thank the Research Committee of Birkbeck College, London, for a grant which enabled me to be relieved of my teaching duties for two terms in 1987 and to undertake research for a book on Belleau. I am also indebted to the British Academy, which in the same year awarded me a travel grant so that I could work in France on Belleau. Without this help the present article could not have been written. 1 Les Amours et nouveaux eschanges des pierres precieuses: vertus Sf proprietez d'icelles.

The title merits consideration first of all. Prior to 1576, Belleau had not produced an individual collection of love poems, although he had written Petrarchist sonnets and baisers in the manner of Secundus. At last, at the age of 48, he brings out his Amours - and writes, not of a woman, but of gems.5 In 1576 he does, it is true, remind us that precious stones are tradi tionally offered as a token of love by dedicating eleven of his poems to illustrious ladies.6 He also makes references to his feelings for a woman who remains a very shadowy figure.7 However, the real ardour of these poems is transposed. In several cases Belleau displays considerable in genuity by creating a fable and doing what he mentions in his dedication to the king, namely imagining that a love story lies behind the stone in question.' 'L'Améthyste' is subtitled 'Les Amours de Bacchus et d'Améthyste' and tells, with echoes of Ovid, Marullus and Ronsard, how Bacchus loves Améthyste - with a fervour that is in part evoked obliquely, via a description of his chariot - but sees her turned to stone before his very eyes by a Diana anxious to preserve the chastity of one of her followers. This metamorphosis is one of the Ovidian-style 'eschanges' to which Belleau refers in the title of his collection.9 There are two more transformations in Poem V, which deals with 'Les Amours de Hyacinthe et de Chrysolithe' and traces the amorous inclinations of three characters. Belleau draws inspiration from Ovid's tale of Apollo's ill-fated love for Hyacinthus and grafts on to it rather obscure laments addressed by Hyacinthe to his lady, Chrysolithe. At times in the course of these the poet appears to be referring to his own relationship with a real woman (see for instance lines 23 to 24, page 96). Lines 271 to 272 make explicit ' See Alfred Glauser, Le poème-symbole: de Scève à Valéry (Paris, 1967), 103, and Hilda Dale, 'Rémy Belleau et la science lapidaire', in Lumières de la Pléiade, De Pétrarque à Descartes, XI (Paris, 1966), 231-42 (pp. 240-1). 6 II, 'Le Diamant', is addressed to the queen, Louise de Vaudemont; IV, 'La Perle', to Marguerite de Navarre, the daughter of Henri II and Catherine de Médicis; vi, 'Le Rubis', to the duchesse de Montpensier, Catherine Marie de Lorraine; VIII, 'Le Coral', to the duchesse de Guise, Catherine de Clèves; X, 'L'Emeraude', to the duchesse de Nevers, Henriette de Clèves; XI, 'Le Saphir', to Marie de Lorraine, the sister of Belleau's pupil, Charles d'Elbeuf; XII, 'La Turquoise', to the maréchale de Retz, famous for her 'Salon Verd' in the Hôtel de Dampierre; XIII, 'L'Agathe', to Hélène de Surgères (to whom Ronsard presents an agate in the Sonnets pour Helene, I, 31); XIV, 'Le Jaspe', to Mlle de Brissac; XVII, 'La Pierre d'aigle', to Mme de Villeroy, wife of a royal minister; and XIX, 'La Pierre d'arondelle', to Mlle de Belleville. The new poems in the 1578 edition have no dedications. ' See for instance ill, 11. 109-20, pp. 73—4; vi, 11. 45-50, pp. 113-14; xii, 11. 61-72, p. 170; xxiv, 11. 13-24, p. 235; xxvi, 11. 67-72, pp. 242-3; xxix, 11. 1-18, pp. 251-2. ' For a more detailed consideration of possible sources than space permits here, see Reinhold Besser, Das Verhàltnis von Remy Belleaus Steingedicht . . . zu den friiheren Steinbiichern und den sonstigen Quellen (Oppeln, 1886) ' See Guy Demerson, 'Poétique de la métamorphose chez Remy Belleau', in Poétiques de la métamorphose, Institut d'Etudes de la Renaissance et de l'Age classique (Saint-Etienne, 1981), 125-42.</page><page sequence="3">Remy Belleau and the Pierres precieuses 195 the link between the metamorphoses of Hyacinthe and Chrysolithe and the title of the work: Voylà de deux Amans et le sang et les pleurs, Eschangez pour mémoire en pierres et en fleurs, (p. 110) Poem VII tells of 'le destin et la flamme fatale / D'Iris la bigarrée et de l'amant Opalle' (11. 1-2, p. 122), and concentrates on the imaginary couple rather than on the properties of the stones with which they are linked. Here it is Iris who makes the advances and Opalle whose transfor mation is evoked in some detail (11. 93-107, p. 127). Another three poems feature Cupid himself: 'L'Onyce' (IX) is a charmingly original evocation of Cupid snipping his mother's fingernails as she sleeps; 'Le Jaspe' (XIV) and 'La Cornaline' (XVl) are shorter pieces, in anacreontic style. Venus appears in 'L'Agathe' (XIII). All these poems embrace sensuous elements. But the transposed fervour of the collection is best illustrated by 'La Pierre d'aymant ou calamité' (III). In the following passage the female in hot pursuit is a magnet: La Calamité errante, et de soif altérée, De ne sçay quelle ardeur cruellement outrée, Evente ce métal, halletant et soufflant D'un désir importun, qui chaud la va bruslant: Puis l'ayant découvert, le chérist et l'embrasse, Le caresse, le baise et le suit à la trace. (11. 33-38, p. 69) Some aspects of the highly physical vocabulary at this point are reminis cent of animals ('halletant', 'soufflant', 'le suit à la trace'); indeed im mediately afterwards the magnet is likened to a hound pursuing a stag (11. 39-42, p. 69). In the following passage, however, where the lodestone and the iron meet, the parallel in the first of the two comparisons is explicitly with human passion: Se rencontrans ainsi, se collent serrément L'un à l'autre aussi tost d'un dous embrassement. Tout ainsi que la vierge, éperdûment espointe Des flèches de l'amour, de forte et ferme estrainte Serre son favorit, et de bras et de main Luy pressant l'estomac contre son large sein. Ou comme le lierre en tournoyant se plisse Contre un chesne moussu, d'une alleure tortisse; Ce métal tout ainsi, se sentant caressé, Tost s'accroche à l'Aymant et le tient embrassé. (11. 83-92, p. 72) The human connotations are underlined by the mention of four parts of the body ('bras', 'main', 'estomac', 'large sein'). The intimacy of the en counter is stressed. We seem, however, to be far from the poet and his</page><page sequence="4">196 Jean Bray brook lady. Not only are the erotic images wound around two metals, but it is female desire which is highlighted: the transposition of the writer's feel ings is a double one. Yet lines 105 to 120 and 141 to 148, as well as the conclusion of the poem, remind us of these feelings by contrasting the poet's hapless pursuit of his obdurate beloved with the quest of the magnet for the iron. These considerations are inseparable from the second surprising aspect of the collection. Were it not for the reference in the title to love and metamorphosis, one would expect the poet to be dealing with inanimate objects; as the prose 'Discours' observes, stones are 'sans vie, ne pouvant recevoir aliment comme les plantes' (11. 60-1, p. 24). Yet the same 'Discours' judges stones in moral terms: it speaks of the 'vices' of imperfect gems (1. 95, p. 28) and the 'naïfveté' and 'bonté' of genuine ones (1. 103, p. 28). Similarly in 'Le Diamant' (II) the poet evokes tests to show whether the stone is 'bon' (1. 20, p. 56). 'L'Eméraude' (χ) considers 'vices' of the gem and uses in describing one with an inadequate sheen words that might be applied to a human being - 'Engourdy, foible, plein de crasse' (1. 122, p. 154). Haematite is deemed 'douce et débonnaire' (XXX, 1. 38, p. 257). And in fact throughout the collection the stones appear as living creatures; the anthropomorphism is not confined to their love affairs.10 This is particularly obvious in 'La Turquoise' (XII). The poem begins with the topos of mutability and points out that even stones become old. It describes them as if they were people: L'une roussist, l'autre se ride, Se flestrist, l'autre plus humide S'altère, meurt, perd le teint beau Qui donnoit couleur à sa peau. (11. 29-32, p. 168) It shows how the turquoise, as it ages, loses 'sa grâce / Et le teint mignard de sa face' (11. 41-2, p. 169). Belleau then celebrates the ability of the tur quoise to become fond of its owner. He speaks of its feeling 'quelque doux allèchement / D'amitié' (11. 50-1, p. 169) and asserts that the stone prefers to be shattered rather than let its wearer come to harm. If the per son wearing it falls ill, the gem too loses its brightness. Its heart at least is not of stone. Similar tender feelings - which clearly count amongst the 'autres affec tions secrètes' that Belleau mentioned to the king - are attributed to the protagonists of 'La Pierre d'aymant ou calamité', which is not only an ex ploration of erotic attraction but also a glorification of friendship. Alongside a scientific examination of the properties of the lodestone, in the course of which Belleau borrows extensively from Lucretius, stands 10 See Dudley Β. Wilson, Descriptive Poetry in France from Blason to Baroque (Manchester and New York, 1967), 152-5.</page><page sequence="5">Remy Belleau and the Pierres precieuses 197 his explanation of magnetism in terms of the personalities of magnetite and iron. Using, as elsewhere in the poem, questions to arouse the reader's wonder, he shows how the magnet's friendly overtures triumph over the warlike nature of the iron: Se voit-il rien çà bas plus dur et moins dontable Que ce métal guerrier? moins dous et moins traitable? Mais en ceste amitié le donteur est donté Et le vainqueur de tout d'un rien est surmonté. (11. 21-4, p. 68)" He enquires further: Mais quel noeu d'amitié fait joindre ces deux corps, Que Nature a faict naistre imployables et forts? (11. 31-2, p. 69) These poems delight in showing an animated world in which the ap parently impossible can happen, unexpected relationships can be formed and hard surfaces can be stripped away to reveal feelings of compassion and affection. Implicit in 'La Turquoise' and 'La Pierre d'aymant ou calamité' is a con trast betwen the mineral world and the human, in which Catholics and Protestants refuse to be reconciled. Indeed, at one point in both poems the poet steps forward and makes the contrast explicit, thereby illustrating a third feature of this collection: the amount of personal feeling that is ex pressed. These pieces are only partly concerned with the colours, the play of light and the changing forms that Belleau is so skilled at evoking; although these elements are important, Belleau also makes clear his fer vent desire that the religious wars should end.12 Taking sides neither with the Catholics nor with the Protestants, he castigates the French in general for their inhumanity and for losing sight of virtues that the gems possess in abundance. His poem about the lodestone contains a moving apostrophe: Ha siècle malheureus et voeuf de jugement, Où les hommes grossiers ont moins de sentiment, Moins de grâce et d'amour que le fer ny la pierre, Armez de cruauté et tous nez pour la guerre, Ennemis de la Paix, prompt à souiller leurs mains Au sang de leur voisin, tant ils sont inhumains! Siècle trop ignorant des douceurs de la vie, Fertile de malheur et pallissant d'envie, " Compare Belleau's use of questions in lines 1 to 32 (pp. 67-9), and in 'Le Coral' (vm), where one finds the recurring phrase 'Qui croiroit . . . ' (11. 13-36, pp. 129-31). 12 In this respect Belleau is far less oblique than Marcel Tetel suggests in 'La poétique de la réflexi vité chez Belleau', Stud. Fran 29 (1985), 1-18 (p. 18).</page><page sequence="6">198 Jean Bray brook Nous faisant savourer en ce val terrien Plus aigrement le mal que doucement le bienl (11. 183-92, p. 78) Belleau's tone here resembles that of d'Aubigné in the calmer passages of Les Tragiques. And he shares with d'Aubigné another feature: his con cern with princes. In 'La Turquoise' he asks God to fill the hearts of princes 'de quelque sentiment / D'amitié' (11. 98-9, p. 172), so that they might protect their towns from ruin. He places at the centre of the first edition the sapphire, a symbol of concord in the ancient world, and, con cluding his poem with a survey of the properties of the gem, writes: Si ta force au cueur des Princes Apporte et grave la Paix, Vien, vien, Saphir, désormais Au secours de nos provinces Et chasse l'inimitié Cruelle, qui sans pitié Contre ses propres entrailles Fait la guerre et peu à peu Allume un torrent de feu Hors et dedans nos murailles. ('Le Saphir', 11. 117-26, pp. 163-1) The enjambement in lines 121 to 122 helps to convey the poet's concern for the plight of his country, whilst the synaesthesia of line 125 suggests disorder, confusion. In 'La Pierre d'arondelle, dicte Chelidonius lapis' (XIX), Belleau first imagines that swallows are savagely dismembered until they yield up the stone their stomachs contain (11. 19-24, pp. 208-9), and then alludes to the terrible legend of Procne, who was changed into a swallow after she served up pieces of her son to her husband (11. 25-30, p. 209). In the penultimate verse, the poet hopes that the stone whose origins are surrounded by so much cruelty might itself help to bring about peace in his land by calming the anger of princes (11. 43-8, p. 210). The violence of this poem is reminiscent of the description of Pro metheus's ordeal, in 'Prométhée premier inventeur des Anneaux et de l'enchasseure des Pierres'. The concluding section of the piece states that Prometheus wore a ring in which was set a stone hewn out of the Cauca sian rock on which he was tortured. The final verse explains how a trend was thus set and how the piece of rock came to be replaced by precious stones. It ends: Et cela qui restoit pour marque d'un malheur, Des Princes et des Rois fust la gloire et l'honneur. (11. 73-74, p. 35) These lines remind one that the very highest in the kingdom would have been familiar with precious stones: Henri III and his court were especially</page><page sequence="7">Remy Belleau and the Pierres precieuses 199 fond of them.1® The lines also strike a moral note: kings and princes wear rings that should remind them of the punishment meted out to those who disobey God.14 Implicit here is one of the messages of the collection as a whole: at a time of civil war, Belleau is attempting to imprint on the minds of his readers - especially the most powerful amongst them - virtues they are in danger of forgetting. So urgent is his mission that he dedicates 'La Pierre du coq, ditte Gemma Alectoria' (XVIII) to France itself, the cock (Latin gallus) being a traditional symbol for the country.15 Although it encapsulates some of the essential features of the original collection, the poem concerning Prometheus does not appear until the edition of 1578. The poet's personal involvement becomes even more marked in this later edition. The brief 'Le BériT (XXV) concludes with a prayer for the end of bloodshed (11. 21-4, p. 238). 'La Pierre sanguinaire, dicte Haematités' (XXX) is concerned throughout with the unnecessary carnage caused by the religious wars. It opens with a direct statement in the first person: Ce nom de sang ne m'est point agréable, Il m'est funeste et l'ay pour exécrable, Voyant les bourgs, les villes et les ports Rouges de sang et pâlies de corps morts. (11. 1-4, p. 254) It continues with a prayer to God, that He might end the conflict in France and unite its princes (11. 9-32, pp. 255-6); and in depicting the stone it emphasizes healing properties (11. 37-60, pp. 257-8).16 A work that seems on the surface to be concerned with purely decorative stones in fact tackles contemporary issues as directly as some of Belleau's other poems, such as the otherwise very different 'Dictamen metrificum de bello huguenotico', the long macaronic piece about the siege of Paris by Condé written in or around 1562. Two poems, one from the 1576 version and one published posthumously, can be seen to represent the major aspects of Belleau's achievements in Les Amours et nouveaux eschanges des pierres precieuses. The first is 'L'Agathe', which opens with an evocation of 'Les Heures, filles im mortelles / Du Soleil' (11. 1-2, p. 174), of dawn and of Venus with her retinue. Venus is presented with a special agate, similar to the one Pliny described as belonging to Pyrrhus.17 In the decoration of this stone nature has surpassed art (11. 61-2, p. 177). Yet at the same time the stone " See Belleau's dedication to Henri III, lines 5 to 6 (pp. 3-4). Belleau himself owned many gems - see M. Connat, 'Mort et testament de Remy Belleau', Bibl Hum R, 6 (1945), 328-56. 14 Compare Verdier's note to lines 73 to 74 (p. 35). " See the final prayer (11. 37-42, p. 206, and Verdier's note to line 37). " See Alexandre Eckhardt, Remy Belleau, sa vie - sa 'Bergerie': Etude historique et critique (Budapest, 1917, reprinted Geneva, 1969), 95. 17 See Verdier's note to line 59, p. 177.</page><page sequence="8">200 Jean Braybrook glorifies the powers of art: it depicts Pegasus, the Hippocrene, Mount Helicon, the Muses and Apollo (11. 63-84, pp. 177-9). Then an obscure passage inspired by pseudo- Orpheus shifts to agates in general and tells us that they bear blood-coloured marks as a result of a struggle that took place when the gods fought to prevent Saturn from overcoming the Earth. The gods' blood poured down on to the Earth and was subsequently mixed with the soil and turned into agates (11. 115-44, pp. 181-2). The grace and beauty of the first part of the poem are counterbalanced by an evocation of cosmic conflict. It is however a conflict out of which emerge things of beauty, the agates. And as the description of one particular agate indicates, the power of nature to make something lovely is paralleled by that of art. Belleau is offering to Hélène de Surgères an agate, his poem, which he hopes will play its part in creating harmony even amidst bloodshed. The other poem to be considered is the last in the 1578 edition, 'La Pierre laicteuse, dicte Galactités'. Alongside the motif of blood contained in the penultimate poem, dedicated to haematite, it places that of milk. Its tone is strikingly personal, as it opens with praise of milk, which helped the poet to recover from his serious illness, probably tuber culosis.18 With this hymn to a liquid it reminds one of the first poem in the 1576 edition, 'L'Améthyste', which celebrates Bacchus and wine (11. 137 41, pp. 45-6), and of 'La Coupe de crystal' (XV), which again sings of the juice of the grape. Only at line 21 does Belleau leave his praise of milk and start to evoke the stone, which supposedly turns milky white when immersed in water. He emphasizes the motif of fecundity - not something one immediately associates with stones - by describing how the mineral can, when made into a potion or hung about the neck, fill a mother's breasts with milk (11. 41-54, pp. 262-3). When certain procedures are carried out, it can similarly ensure that grazing animals have a constant supply of milk (11. 55-68, pp. 263-4). The poem ends with the observa tion that the stone has the 'mesme saveur / Que le lait, des enfans le père nourrisseur' (11. 79-80, p. 265)." Before he concludes, however, the poet remembers the belief that the stone can make a person forget his evil in tentions, and cries: Pleust à Dieu que ceux-là qui ne sont en la France Que pour se souvenir de meurdre et de vengeance, Te portant sous la langue eussent entièrement La mémoire égarée avec le sentiment. (11. 73-6, p. 264) The final poem of the 1578 collection is based on contrasts. It associates a stone, something one normally connects with solidity, with a liquid. " See Verdier's note on the title of this piece, p. 260. " For the idea of fertility elsewhere in the collection, see 'La Perle' (iv), 11. 4S-8 (p. 88), where the motif is similarly that of a child at the breast; 'La Pierre d'aigle, ditte Aetités (xvii), 11. 34-6 (p. 200); 'La Pierre aqueuse' (xxvi), 11. 49-51 (p. 241).</page><page sequence="9">Remy Belleau and the Pierres precieuses 201 It links an unyielding mineral with fertility, in a manner reminiscent of Ronsard. It is composed by an ill, war-weary poet who nevertheless thinks with joy of babies and young animals and emphasizes the notion of healing. 'La Pierre laicteuse' forms a worthy conclusion to a collection that plays with the reader's expectations, infusing gems with a love Belleau refuses to attach directly to one woman, bringing them alive and filling them with emotions in which the poet finds his contemporaries sadly lacking. Like Les Amours et nouveaux eschanges des pierres precieuses as a whole, it is written by a poet who - as in his comedy, La Reconnue, for instance - refuses to espouse one religious cause but is concerned to soften the hearts of even the highest in the kingdom, and who ultimately places faith in the curative value of art.
