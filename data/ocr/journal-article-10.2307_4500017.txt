Something as firm, formed, stable, fixed, and unshifting as architecture would hardly appeal, let alone respond to the interrogation of the informe, the unseen, and the unthought as the subjects habitually attributed to Damisch. And yet from the outset, without much fanfare, and with no treatise or book to advertise the fact, this detective of the elusive has been elaborating, through incisive and regularly published essays, a theory of architecture. Or rather, on the surface at least, he has been interrogating other, historical, theories of architecture, in such a way that, if read systematically, and preferably consecutively in the chronological order of their subject-matter, an emergent theory of architecture might be discerned; one that, while not pretending to operative or instrumental status, nevertheless construes the subject in a radical frame, a frame that if allowed will shift the nature of architectural understanding, or, as Damisch prefers, architectural 'thinking.' The question posed by architecture is, again on the surface, simple enough. Hegel put it concisely, after his own discerning reading of architectural theories from antiquity to the Enlightenment. If art was, in essence, the imposition (or projection) of meaning onto material without such prior meaning by the act of shaping, then architecture, as an art of shaping to give meaning would find its essential nature in a 'symbolic' form. However, and herein lies the contradiction, the social task of architecture is not to symbolise but to shelter - its symbolic form, once hollowed out for occupation is denied by its 'classic' use-value. Hegel's solution as we know is to propose an all-subsuming dialectic, whereby the standing-stone or pyramid (symbolic) is taken over by the temple (classic) only to be uplifted into the symbolic form of congregational aspiration in the cathedral (romantic). Hegel, whose argument is premised on the ultimate obsolescence of all artistic forms once they have accomplished their mission in the dialectical history and ultimate triumph of the spirit, abandons architecture at this point, in favour of painting, poetry, music, and, of course, philosophy itself. But the fatal disjunction of architecture has been revealed: how might we understand, or think, a practice that is at once an art, judged by all the criteria of a disinterested aesthetic, and at the same time a function, judged by all the criteria of social interest. Hegel is, of course, here following Kant with some historical embellishment; and Kant is following the Enlightenment tradition that sees architecture as a 'mixed art,' balanced between art and use. The philosophe d'Alembert was more precise when he characterised architecture in the Preface to the Encyclope'die as 'simply the embellishment of one of man's greatest needs,' thence positioning architecture as something added-to, something surplus-to, something equivalent to 'rhetoric' as the embellishment of philosophical reasoning, or grammatical structure.

The aesthetic, social, political, and professional debates that have tried to subsume one term beneath the other, dialectically balance the two terms, or transcend both in order to find a third way, comprise in a real sense the entire history of architectural theory, reflecting similar debates over 'culture' and 'society' in the modern period, but in a way that is deeply embedded in the dichotomies of the practice itself. It has, indeed, become almost impossible to think of architecture in any other way. In 1981, Hubert Damisch contributed an introduction to the first French translation of Emil Kaufmann's 1933 book, Von Ledoux bis Le Corbusier, a pioneer study of the late eighteenth-century architect Claude-Nicolas Ledoux that not incidentally saw him as a pioneer of the Modern Movement in architecture, anticipating the twentieth-century minimalism of Adolf Loos, Le Corbusier, and Richard Neutra.l Damisch entitled his introduction 'Ledoux avec Kant,' referring to Kaufmann's own interpretation of Ledoux as a thinker who, without necessarily having read Kant, nevertheless proposed a parallel rationalism and sense of 'autonomy' in architecture to that posed by Kant in philosophy. Both, argued Kaufmann, were responding to the exigencies of an emerging bourgeois (modern) society, that found its ideal political form in the social democracies of the early twentieth century, democracies seriously threatened by fascism at the time of Kaufmann's writing. Damisch's title also, and self-consciously, evoked comparison with another celebrated essay, Jacques Lacan's study of 'Kant avec Sade,' published in 1963 as an introduction to the Marquis de Sade's Philosophie dans le boudoir in a new edition of his Oeuvres compldtes. In this essay, Lacan proposes a reading of de Sade that sees him as, in a sense, extending and fulfilling the promise of freedom inherent in the Critique of udgement: La Philosophie dans le boudoir vient huit ans apris la Critique de la raison pratique. Si, apris avoit vu qu'elle s'y accorde, nous d6montrons qu'elle la complete, nous dirons qu'elle donne la v6rit6 de la Critique.2 In this sense, Damisch, in his own title, would be evoking a parallel reading of Ledoux with Kant and de Sade, and further, a parallelism between himself reading Kaufmann reading Ledoux with Kant, and Lacan reading de Sade with Kant. The imbricated relationships thus established by Damisch, set up a kind of critical chain-letter that runs from Ledoux to Kant, to de Sade, to Kaufmann, to Lacan, to Damisch and thence back to Ledoux and forward to the contemporary state of architecture after Modernism, a state to which Damisch refers in his introduction. The theoretical relations implied by this exchange of titles between Ledoux and de Sade, and more generally between late eighteenth-century utopianism and sadism, were a commonplace of late 1960s criticism, shared by Barthes, Foucault, and, in architectural theory, Tafuri. Inherited from Adorno and Horkheimer's 1944 Dialectics of Enlightenment, which explored the dark side of reason with explicit reference to de Sade's justine, the shock effect of the juxtaposition of the hitherto unmentionable 1.

It was no coincidence that Ledoux figured prominently on the cover of the 1971 republication of Barthes' book, with the Saline de Chaux mistaken for Fourier's Phalanstere placed beneath Man Ray's portrait of de Sade constructed in the stones of the Bastille, and Titian's portrait of Loyola.3 Certainly the connections posed between Ledoux and de Sade are both structural, in the sense of philosophical homologies and intellectual destinies, and historical. Ledoux, called by Kaufmann a 'Revolutionary' architect, was equally a victim of the Terror, as was de Sade. Both claimed a political and social radicality far more extreme than that of the Revolutionaries themselves; both were doomed to the status of ineffective 'utopians' during the nineteenth century, and both were revived in the 1920s as proto-social-avant-gardists, before being condemned to utopian, or worse 'visionary', status in the supposed sociopolitical radicalism of the 1960s. Both Ledoux and de Sade, further, explored the limits of social behaviour through geometry, the one in spatial terms, the other in mathematical combinations; geometry, the language of reason, joined them once more to Kant. It was the recourse to fundamental geometries, however, that pointed the link between Kant and Ledoux for Damisch. If for Ledoux, architecture was to be reformulated, not as structure, nor as imitation of antiquity, but rather as the play of basic geometrical forms - the 'letters of the alphabet' for architecture as he stated - so the relationship with Kant was established through Kant's own appeal to foundational geometry in the myth of Thales as he notes in the preface to the second edition of the Critique. This might, Damisch proposes, establish a new kind of historicity for architecture, and thence the break that Kaufmann sees between (Baroque) heteronomy, and (Enlightenment) autonomy, a break that sets up reason in architecture as founded on pure geometry, and architecture as a 'science' destined as science to become modern. From this, Damisch sees a Ledoux understanding architectural form in much the same way as Husserl sees the 'origin' of geometry, the gradual refining of polished surfaces, the emergence of the precise line, the sharp angle, the exact point. But Ledoux's Kantianism cannot rely only on this beginning; for architecture is nothing if it is not connected intimately to society - rather than the play of pure reason, it is the instrument of practical reason.4 For this connection Ledoux relies on Rousseau, his 'return to principle,' to 'nature,' and to the fundamental consituents of 'man' isolated and in community. Thus Ledoux appeals to the 'social pact' elaborated in the Contrat social, where individual freedom is joined to social unity; all his ideal monuments stress this bond, whether in the 'Maison d'union,' or house for confraternities, or in the 'Cenobie' or retreat for families. Here, Ledoux's 'Kant' is more Ledoux's 'Rousseau' and Kant's 'Rousseau,' in the dialogical terms assayed by Ernst Cassirer in his essays of 1933, precisely contemporary with Kaufmann's own thesis. This moral aspect of Ledoux's fundamentalism, seen by Kaufmann and Damisch as a prerequisite of ascetic modernism, from Loos to Le Corbusier, is joined in Damisch's terms, to another principle, that of egalitarian 'legality.' This is symbolised, architecturally, by the predominance of the plan as opposed to the facade. For the Baroque, the 3.

For architecture, as the autonomous instrument of autonomous society, has to be available to all. This is what the socialist Hannes Meyer understood when in a perceptive essay of 1942, he remarked that what Ledoux wished to accomplish was the conferring of architecture - the formal terms through which architecture dignified life - on the whole of society; thus the pyramid gifted to the charcoal burner, and so on. Of course, as commentators from Sedlmayr on have recognised, the idea of Ledoux as a 'Revolutionary' architect, a connection made explicitly by Kaufmann, is, given his incarceration by the Terror, and previous aristocratic and royal patronage, decidedly unhistorical in a political sense. It was seen as equally specious to join a supposed revolutionary architect to an anti-revolutionary architect like Le Corbusier, whose question 'Architecture ou revolution' closed Vers une architecture. Yet, as Damisch and Tafuri have recognised, and Kaufmann conceded, 'revolutionary' acts, whether in philosophy, politics, or architecture may not follow the polemics of parties or ideologies, but rather have the effect of 'inaugural' moments in history, that, so to speak, momentarily reduce 'history' to a kind of 'prehistory,' a new start that refers back to a model origin. It is this suspension of history that draws Damisch's Ledoux, not so much towards Le Corbusier, but to the present condition of architecture, one that in the late 1970s and early 1980s was eagerly appealing to a travesty of history under the name of postmodernism, drawing on history as a mere 'history of styles,' and claiming a renewed 'humanism' in the name of a reduced historical semiotics. The status of history itself with regard to an architecture that, with modernism, had attempted to remove itself from historicity, was thus thrown into doubt. Against this, Damisch finds the potential of an 'architectural knowledge' outside of history: To think of Ledoux with Kant is to recognize that in the matter of architecture, knowledge is not solely derived from history; or better said, in Kant's terms, a knowledge that subjectively presents itself as historical, according to the way it was acquired, can participate, objectively, in one form or another of rationality.5 This would be to introduce the notion of theory, a theory that does not depend on history, but that which 'constitutes architecture as an object not only of history but also of thought.' This then would be the importance of Kaufmann's paradoxical enterprise, to give modernism a history it did not want in order to establish the tabula rasa it desired. 'What is thinking in painting, in forms and through means proper to it,' asked Damisch in another context, that of his investigation of another 'origin,' that of perspective, a work completed in 1983 contemporaneously with his introduction to Kaufmann. In the case of painting, Damisch has demonstrated that perspectiva artificialis allows the painter not simply to 'show' but also to 'think' by means of an apparatus that is epistemologically akin to the sentence in language. Perspective organises 'point of view, vanishing point, and distance point, and the other corollary points designating here, there, and over there - which is sufficient to make it possible to speak, again nonmetaphorically of a geometry of the sentence that would have its analogue in the figurative register.' In this sense, perspective, like the sentence, 'assigns the subject 5. Hubert Damisch, 'Ledoux avec Kant,' preface to the French translation of Emil Kaufmann, De Ledoux ac Le Corbusier.

OXFORD ART JOURNAL 28.2 2005 209</page><page sequence="8">Anthony Vidler within a previously established network that gives it meaning, while at the same time opening up the possibility of something like a statement in painting.'7 With respect for Damisch's parallel preoccupation with architecture, we might be allowed to suppose that, underlying his essays on this constructive art, Damisch would be moving close to asking the same question of architecture, as in, for example, 'What is thinking in architecture, in forms and through means proper to it?' What then might provide such an apparatus for architecture, one that might allow it to think and even, despite its supposed abstraction, make a statement something akin to a sentence? Certainly, the 'origin' of geometry, in the same way as the 'origin' of perspective for painting, provides a partial answer for architecture. Even as Greek geometry purified itself (in Husserl's terms) of all anthropomorphism, so architecture in Ledoux's hands purified itself of organic metaphor, bodily embodiment, and the imitation of antiquity. The process of 'autonomisation of form' construed columns as cylinders bereft of human proportions, villas as cubes denied all Palladian attributes save that of their diagrammatic nine-square plans, and houses that 'spoke' solely through geometrical alphabetisation. But beyond this specifically eighteenth-century model, Damisch develops a set of conditions that reach into the post-historicism of the late twentieth century, and that derive, not from Ledoux, but from two other earlier studies of instaurational moments: that of Alberti, and that of Viollet-le-Duc.8 In both cases Damisch is concerned with structure - not exactly the material structure of a building, although this too, but structure in the sense of thought. Architectural thinking is here carried out through the idea of structure, and turns on the Albertian problem of 'column' and 'wall.' Interrogating the idea of 'structure' in Alberti's treatise, by way of distinguishing between the idea of continuity signified by the word in Vitruvian and Roman usage, and that of discontinuity, of the assemblage of discrete elements, implied by the more modern usage after Viollet-le-Duc, Damisch confronts the apparent paradox of Alberti's dloge of the column as 'the principle ornament of architecture,' and his limitations on its use with respect to the wall and its continuity. Similarly, in his essay on Viollet-le-Duc's essay 'Construction,' it is not so much the material structure that Damisch seeks, but precisely the mechanism in thought that would, without rupture, bring theoretical and physical structure together within the same 'architectural thought.' The quest for architectural origins, the fundamental beginnings of architecture, has, of course a long history, from Vitruvius, through the Renaissance, to the Enlightenment and after. Vitruvius provided the most composite account of such origins, by cobbling together Greek and Roman myths of commencement, from Hesiod to Virgil, manufacturing a story that became paradigmatic, in one version or another, for all future theories. For Vitruvius, it was the coming together of society around fire, the invention of language from sensation, and the demand by society for shelter, a story that was repeated ad infinitum through the Renaissance. For the eighteenth-century philosophe, the abbe Laugier, concerned to provide a more philosophical origin that would also operate as a measure of quality and authenticity, it was the construction of a hut by a single 'natural' man, out of elements found in the forest: a branch set vertically became a column, horizontally it was an entablature, diagonally a roof member and proto-pediment. From the hut to the temple, was also 7. Hubert Damisch, The Origin of Perspective (1994), p. 446. 8.

Diderot, and after him Goethe, were unsure of this origin, set up as it was to produce a simplified Greek revival temple, and preferred an origin that privileged the wall, and shelter, rather than construction. In this context, Damisch's interest in the debate over origins, precisely as it intersects with these narratives, is both undermining of their literal qualities, and at the same time revealing of their contradictions - for example Alberti's wall column dilemma, transformed into separate theoretical traditions after the eighteenth century and not yet entirely untangled in the present debates over 'tectonics,' 'history,' and 'diagram.' Damisch, a result as much of his interest in the 'column' and 'structure,' has been called a Structuralist. This would be so, certainly, if by 'structuralist' one means an attention to the rational structure of thought, of discourse, and of the relations of one proposition to the next. But it would be less true of that 'Damisch' who, in parallel with Lacan and Derrida, and in sympathy with both, interrogates the hidden under-psyche of architectural thought, that underneath, which, as Hegel had it, was dug deeply beneath the first symbolic monuments of architecture, the pyramids; an underneath that eventually, and inevitably, undermined the very symbolic role of the art, and transformed it into a useful, classical, practice. However, it is also the underneath, that 'crypt,' of writing, investigated by Derrida, that will of itself deny the authority of every statement, every monument to certainty and belief. As well, it is that underneath, spoken of by Lacan, that remains in the psyche long after the mirror has apparently constituted the self as a whole, structured the world as an imago, formed a supposed whole out of part objects. It is this 'whole,' this surface unity that Damisch cannot in the end find satisfactory as an explanation for the perfection of an architectural object, itself in classical theory a stand-in for the human body and its qualities. Which is why, in a later iteration of his own (hidden) architectural theory, Damisch finds solace in the fact that a building, like a painted image, can be a cloud; formless, yet structured and technologically sound; Viollet-le-Duc welded to Turner, the classical to the modern, transformed in Diller and Scofidio's 2001 pavilion for the Swiss Exposition, into a shifting, nebulous, informe architecture - an architecture that, finally, will speak of its own internal contradictions (Figs 1 -3).
