<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANTHONY LIBBY * Merwin's Planet: Alien Voices The curious landscape W. S. Merwin creates is seldom inhabited by men. Epecially in the late sixties, when his poetry achieved its most characteristically grim intensity, Merwin's planet was a place of silence and exclusion. The Merwin of the fifties was capable of writing heroic fables, recently (1977) he has even written a lush poetry of sensual love, but the Merwin of the phase initiated by The Lice in 1967 seemed a terminal pessimist who formed his strongest visions out of language as stark as the landscape to which he obsessively returned. Ironically, his apparent despair over what is possible for humans appears to have energized him, as many in America were energized, in that time of psychopolitical anger and rebellion, by bleakly negative expectations. In 1969 and 1970, when his work of the half decade appeared in print, it amounted to a remarkable seven volumes of poetry, prose, and translations of both, almost—to measure crudely—a thousand pages of visions and revisions. There appear in those pages almost all of iMerwin's habitual devices and subjects, displayed at their most impressive, for he achieved in those years one of his peaks, probably his highest. But the two dominant tendencies in those collections demand special attention because they represent, in strangely interlocked ways, the poet's method of dealing with the distrust of humanity so compellingly announced in The Lice, in lines like " Tonight once more/I find a single prayer and it is not for men " or " If I were not human I would not be ashamed of anything." 1 If being ashamed can be con sidered a virtue in this context, as well as a sign of the capacity for evil, Merwin is here not totally misanthropic. But his fatalistic bitter * Anthony Libby, an Associate Professor of English at Ohio State University, has recently completed a book on secular mysticism in modern American poetry. 1 The Lice (New York: Atheneum, 1967), pp. 71, 43.

Against his own humanity and that of any conceivable reader, his completed work dominated by quiet joy in the contem plation of man's imminent extinction, Merwin still went on with the very human business of poetry, with its ineluctable affirmation of human voice and vision. His stance seemed contradictory, but like the other great poets of negative vision, Merwin made a way with a logic of its own, long before he retreated from the art of misanthropy into evocations of the type of private love many of us use in bad times as the final barrier against cultural darkness. He immersed himself in other men's poems, but he also focused his own attention on non human consciousness, trying to purify that attention of ordinary human responses, to make of his poetic line a cool and objective probe into the unknowable. The non-human most conspicuously dominates Merwin's chapbook of animal poems, Animae-, published in 1969, it demonstrates the con tinuity and development of his animal interests by reprinting several poems originally published in 1963 and 1967, as well as those soon to appear in his 1970 collection The Carrier of Ladders. The process of purifying his voice shows there and in his choice of French and Spanish writers to translate, the cool and aphoristic Porchia, Chamfort, and Follain. (The passionate surrealist Neruda hardly fits the "cool and aphoristic" category, but most of Merwin's translations of Neruda—published in 1969—date from the late fifties.) Primarily the refinement of voice shows in the dark and glacial Carrier and in the strange prose of The Miner's Pale Children (also 1970), at times even more remote than the inhuman visions of those writers with whom it obviously invites comparison, Kafka and Borges. In these two collections Merwin comes to a flowering all the more impressive for its dark roots.2 " Absolute despair has no art," 3 Merwin has written in discussing his own, but relative despair and shame over being human create for him an art of unsettling power; the very blackness of his vision forces him into unexplored poetic territory. 2 In 1973 Jarold Ramsey was willing to assert that " The Carrier of Ladders is unquestionably Merwin's greatest book," in " The Continuities of W. S. Merwin: 'What Has Escaped Us, We Bring with Us,'" Massachusetts Review, 14 (1973), J90. It also seems clear that The Miner's Pale Children has a depth and eerie resonance lacking in Merwin's recent book of prose House and Travellers. '"Notes for a Preface," The Distinctive Voice, ed. William J. Martz (Glen view, III.: Scott, Foresman, 1966), p. 272.</page><page sequence="3">50 Anthony Libby For those of us gloomy enough to remember, the sources of Merwin's despair are no mystery. For ecological as well as more traditional political reasons (Vietnam) Merwin felt by 1970 that the civilization which culminated in America was in a terminal phase of moral and cultural entropy. Often, as in " Presidents," this feeling becomes evident in specifically political poetry: The president of shame has his own flag the president of lies quotes the voice of God as last counted the president of loyality recommends blindness to the blind (Carrier, 57) That political cynicism is complemented by a pervasive sense of psychological emptiness and confusion. Doubtless Merwin chose to translate Chamfort's ironically titled Products of the Perfected Civili zation because he felt responsive to Chamfort's nearly total cynicism, which Merwin compares with that of his contemporaries in the time of the Revolution, de Sade and Laclos. For Merwin, as for Chamfort, creation is inextricable from negation. Merwin quotes George Poulet that Chamfort's lucidity is " ' sometimes ... made up of negative knowledge... the consciousness of being situated in a place in the mind from which certain inner truths are forever excluded,' " and adds his own suggestion that such limitations " concern us and our society. They lead, with a peculiar bright restlessness, to one of the insistent concerns of decadent and revolutionary ages: What do you really want? " 4 Though our late sixties, especially in comparison with Chamfort's time, now seem more decadent than revolutionary, the question was obviously central for Merwin and us his audience. The issue is further complicated by another question, whether poetry of such " negative knowledge " can provide any insight in a time when visions came hard. Merwin's commitment to the music of negation had been increasingly evident since the early sixties. In 1962 his long article in the Nation on the Everyman anti-bomb demonstrations signalled his developing political disillusionment, and in 1963 the publication of The Moving Target first demonstrated a new spare surrealist style well '"Introduction," Products of the Perfected Civilization (Toronto: Macmillan, 1967), p. 23.</page><page sequence="4">Merwin's Planet: Alien Voices 51 suited to his increasingly pessimistic vision. When The Lice revealed him as fully the poet of nothingness,5 of the continuing apocalypse that fails to bring revelation, it was clear that his perspective had darkened well beyond the limits of political protest. Protest assumes the possibility of an alternative, and for Merwin by the end of the sixties it seemed too late for alternatives. Man the destroyer was cut off from any natural or spiritual centers of value; in a richly deserved exile he waited in darkness for the end of the End. Merwin, for whom periodic stylistic change seems a necessity of poetic life, was of course unable to sustain this perspective indefinitely. By the time (1973) of Writings to an Unfinished Accompaniment, it had begun to seem mannered, as the poet pushed stylistic spareness beyond repetition to exhaustion in too many poems; the style of vatic utterance is perhaps more difficult to sustain than any other. So finally, in The Compass Flower (1977) Merwin turned from the imagery of winter to the imagery of spring and summer, from obses sion with apocalypse to depictions of daily life and romantic love, though sometimes the love happens among familiar ruins. The turn was necessary, the new poetry has its distinction, but one reads this poetry of acceptance with, ironically, a sense of loss. Nostalgia for the old bitter Merwin—like nostalgia for the angry turbulance of the sixties—may be ill-advised, but his sixties poetry was so marked by a despair-defying energy, so sure, so consistently able to achieve richness out of almost nothing human that it seems uniquely powerful, an impossibly vital poetry of nearly absolute negation. How did he sustain it? The particular excitement Merwin was able to create with his poems about distance and exile is superficially under standable by comparison with another characteristic product of the apocalyptic imagination, science fiction. Merwin's planet is a place out of the science fiction that rose to dominance in the late sixties, a fiction radically opposed to the early space operas and the fifties' visions of constructive mutation and evolution. The most philosophi cally ambitious science fiction, from Wells to Huxley to the great majority of serious recent authors, has been characterized by a pro phetic cynicism about man and his devices, but energized by a fascination with sheer strangeness and distance also evident in Merwin. In some of the " fictions" in Miner's Merwin even uses the basic sf technique of introducing one impossible condition into an otherwise s His mystical use of the idea of nothingness is the subject of my " W.

As its constant use of words like " ancient" and " antiquity " suggests, Miner's evokes the realm of myth and the past more than the future world of science fiction, but the fascination of distance is central to both. Actually, the sheer fact of temporal distance is often more important than its direction. Like much sf, such poems in Carrier as " Shore " or " Banishment in Winter " (which concerns the descent of " the wands ") may be happening, like " The Herds " in Lice, either in the remote past or the distant future. But Merwin's hallucinatory extrapolations are marked by more than the somewhat relieved escape they offer from the time of man's dominance. They also have an odd sense of stasis which brings them close to the most obsessive fantasies of contemporary science fiction. New silence between the end and the beginning The planet that was never named because it was dark climbs into the evening nothing else moves (Carrier, 78) The still quality of this scene, as well as many of the specific details of other poems (like the ancient rusting ship in " The Hulk," left behind as the water leaves the harbor), strongly suggests the landscape of J. G. Ballard, entropy's celebrant. Ballard is considered one of the fathers of the " new wave" science fiction of the sixties, not only because of his unusual attention to style but because of his insistence on the importance of collective psychology, and on the interaction between external and internal, landscape and psyche. In his best fiction, which means his short stories, that landscape tends to be as empty and static as Merwin's deserts or black plateaux. Like Merwin, Ballard obsessively imagines a lone consciousness caught on some geo graphical edge, often the shore of a sea of water or sand, after most sentient life has vanished. Sometimes he allows three or four char acters into his stories, but he invariably suggests that they are civilization's remnants waiting out the middle of the end. Often they must confront the strange new animals of the apocalypse, the giant cruciform birds of " Storm-Bird, Storm-Dreamer," or the lead-shielded frogs of Ballard's masterpiece " The Voices of Time." Though his novels tend to be more active and occasionally even crowded, little or nothing happens in Ballard's apocalyptic stories. They seldom offer recognizable affirmation; their power derives</page><page sequence="6">Merwin's Planet: Alien Voices 53 almost entirely from their contemplation of loss and emptiness, their celebration of distance from men. Ballard's misanthropy is more literal than Merwin's, as again and again he enacts scenarios for the destruc tion of humanity. But he derives from this sterile vision an aesthetic energy often lacking in his longer and occasionally more optimistic works. He offers more than the pleasures of distance and empty space, though like Merwin he sometimes perceives emptiness in mystical terms; he achieves a certain purity of vision because of his apparent indifference to human concerns. In a time when affirmation is suspect he creates a sense of inhuman objectivity, a purity of negation which may, in its comparative simplicity, help to explain what Merwin makes of misanthropy. But Merwm's style is in complex ways more suited to the particulars of his vision than Ballard's. Finally Ballard's romantic fatalism shows tendencies more romantic than fatalistic. Like many sf evocations of empty space and dying planets, his are often couched in a prose that is finally too lush for its subject, a stylistic distraction from emptiness. For instance " The Voices of Time," which concerns not just the destruction of man but the end of the universe, comes to its own end in a burst of color. Kaldren returned to his seat and lay back quietly, his eyes gazing across the lines of exhibits. Half-asleep, periodically he leaned up and adjusted the flow of light through the shutter, thinking to himself, as he would do through the coming months, of Powers and his strange mandala, and of the Seven and their journey to the white gardens of the moon, and the blue people who had come from Orion and spoken in poetry to them of ancient beautiful worlds beneath golden suns in the island galaxies, vanished forever now in the myriad deaths of ths cosmos.6 Between 1963 and 1973 Merwin moved almost as far as he could from such lushness, deliberately refusing any romantic amelioration of his pessimism. Instead, as L. Edwin Folsom puts it, the poetic " self becomes voiceless, as the things he would use his voice to describe disappear: a barren landscape is all that remains, and the poet's stripped, barren words reflect it." 7 Merwin's distrust of human values naturally ' Chronopolis (New York: Putnam, 1971), p. 39. 7" Approaches and Removals: W. S. Merwin's Encounter with Whitman's America," Shenandoah, 39 (1978), 39.</page><page sequence="7">54 Anthony Libby implies a distrust of human language, even his own, and he moves to purify it, or at least to reduce it to the minimum traditionally accepted by the large groups of humans who have always distrusted language, to the aphoristic style of folk wisdom. As Merwin translates Antonio Porchia, " He who tells the truth says almost nothing." 8 The aphorists Merwin translates do not create his minimalist style; he was writing an occasional spare and epigrammatic poem as early as "Epitaph" in his first collection The Mask of J anus (1952), and by the time of "Dead Hand" (1963) he had refined the aphoristic style into a tool of great force. But Porchia's aphorisms, Chamfort's epigrams, and Jean Follain's spare but baroque surrealist poems—all of which he translated in 1969—clearly influence Merwin. They also demonstrate the peculiar strength of the spare impersonal style. Por chia's tend to be aphorisms of vision, most of which sound like gnomic explications of Merwin, like " It is when I assent to nothing that I assent to all" or " He who has seen everything empty itself is close to knowing what everything is filled with." 9 Chamfort's epigrams are usually more traditional exercises in the logic of clever social observation: " Rank without merit earns deference without respect," or " Society, which greatly shrinks men, reduces women to almost nothing." 10 Both types of aphorism share the air of incontrovertible authority, the sense of truth beyond subjectivity. This results partly from the very spareness of the statement; the non-essential seems pared away, and what remains must be essence. But these aphorisms, like most of Merwin's, share another rhetorical characteristic: their dual structure, syntactical parallelism often centering on parallel or repeated verbs. The impression of inevitability that we experience at the end of a well made aphorism is often created by shape as much as by sense; the first parallel phrase creates an expectation which the second phrase neatly fulfills, and the aphorism clicks shut, apparently of its own accord. If it actually voices a profound truth, so much the better, but the conviction, like the humor of a joke's punch line, comes partly from the rhythm.11 8 Voices (Chicago: Big Table, 1969), p. 19. 9 Porchia, pp. 16, 10. 10 Chamfort, pp. 121, 169. 11 In "Ballade of Sayings" (Writings, 93) Merwin mocks the rhetoric of aphorisms by including in a catalogue of epigrams some which sound impressive but mean little: " in summer if there are fleas there will be rejoicing." Much " folk wisdom " is that significant.</page><page sequence="8">Merwin's Planet: Alien Voices 55 Chamfort, who tends to be long-winded for an aphorist, under stands this inadequately (and sometimes uses parallelism for easy effects) but Merwin understands the rhetoric of objectivity very well. Lice begins to show his mastery of the parallel-structured aphorism, its cold and impersonal authority well suited to Merwin's inhuman calm in facing Ends: " Today belongs to few and tomorrow to no one " (24), or "But we were not born to survive/Only to live" (33). Carrier extends the uses of the form, for instance using it to give mythic description greater resonance: " The cold of the heights is not the cold of the valleys" in the realm of "The Black Plateau" (40). But Merwin usually reserves this structure for visionary last lines: " and when we have gone they say we are with them forever " (58). As Merwin's phrasing becomes increasingly more stark, the proverbial style is increasingly evident, though parallel structure is less consistently the rule, as Carrier often abandons the sense of finality for a deliberately more uncertain tone. But short aphoristic units continue to dominate Merwin's phrasing, even in the extended prose structures of Miner's, where such powerful new myths as " Blue" derive some of their resonance from terse rhetoric. Such terseness, and Merwin's growing preference for the visionary aphorism and the language of incantation over the aphorism of logic and the language of analysis, are consistent not only with Merwin's distrust of humanity but with his developing interest in dumb beasts. His early infatuation with the power of words is often qualified by antagonism to logical " naming," especially the symbolic naming of animals, a practice Merwin both decries and indulges in. "White Goat, White Ram," from Green with Beasts uses an animal " who has no names to see with" to symbolize unnameable knowledge as well as the limitations of more traditional symbolism and human classification in general. Naming traps not the named but the namer in a false knowing, " our dumbness" about self as well as others. Though we use these beasts as symbols For all our parables, yet the mystery they stand in Is still as far from what they signify As from the mystery we stand in. It is the sign We make of them, not they, that speaks from their dumbness That our dumbness may speak. There in the thin grass A few feet away they browse beyond words; for a mystery Is that for which we have not yet received Or made the name (First, 137)</page><page sequence="9">&gt;6 Anthony Libby The convoluted verbosity of this passage conflicts with its expressed distrust of words. By the time Merwin describes himself, in " Fly," as "I who have believed too much in words" (Animae, 25) his dis satisfaction with the language of categories has led him through major stylistic changes to denser and more ritualistic phrasing, chants to serve his dark myths. Finally "Exercise" (Writings, 69) goes so far as to recommend a process of forgetting which eventually obliterates all numbers and letters, all the tools of categorical misperception of the world. But the end of that poem, which goes on to recommend forgetting everything, is edged with the ambivalence inadvertently suggested by " White Goat." We may be blinded by names, but as "What We Are Named For" explains, without them we may be nothing. To say what or where we came from has nothing to do with what or where we came from. We do not come from there any more, but only from each word that proceeds out of the mouth of the unnamed. And yet sometimes it is our only way of pointing to who we are. {Miner, 132, quoted entire) In flight from human perspectives, Merwin will turn increasingly to beasts to answer the question of identity. " Who am I? Jarold Ramsay claims, provides " the central life of imaginative continuity in The Lice—and indeed, in Merwin's career as a whole." 12 But the poet aproaches the problem by devious ways. To deny naming entirely is to deny the question; the animal perspective provides near answers to it through a different naming, less suspect because closer to the unnameable, as aphorisms are close to silence, the " almost nothing " of the truthful man. Animals naturally embody that un knowing state which becomes, for Merwin, the condition of sensitivity to the spirit of the world. This romantic archetypal dream of lingering Edenic animal innocence is frequently explicated by Follain, whose Transparence of the World is dominated by poems involving animals, actual or more often magical. Follain stresses their innocence of self-consciousness; they are " unaware of having been born " (as Merwin translates " inconscient d'etre ne " 13). Merwin's early animals, like the white goat and the others in the 12 Ramsay, p. 582. 13 Transparence (New York: Atheneum, 1969), p. 99.</page><page sequence="10">Merwin's Planet: Alien Voices 57 sequence Physiologus: Chapters for a Bestiary,' participate directly in such angelic unconsciousness. Consequently the poet sees them from a distance; they have nothing to say, and the poet will not presume to enter their subjective experience of the world. But even the early Merwin was tempted to occasional near-violations of their inno cence, the result of artificial intersections between animal and human consciousness. " East of the Sun and West of the Moon," which comes not from the territory of science fiction but from the allied world of fairy tales, imagines a visionary talking bear, who turns out to be an enchanted prince but is experienced as a humanized animal, in " a tale that might be human " (First, 85). But it was not until the sixties that Merwin's beasts began habitually to speak. One of the first of his animal narrators is " Noah's Raven." The bird's human voice bluntly violates the poem's emphasis on the separation between man and animal, but Merwin runs the risks of anthropomorphism for good reason: to find a completely self-assured voice for his distrust of his own species. The raven was the first bird Noah sent to explore for land receding flood; unlike the dove, it never returned. Why should I have returned? My knowledge would not fit into theirs. I found untouched the desert of the unknown, Big enough for my feet. It is my home. It is always beyond them. The future Splits the present with the echo of my voice. Hoarse with fulfillment, I never made promises. (Animae, 7) Ironically the bird's human speech only emphasizes its distance from man, and man's alienation from its world and its way of knowing. The poem achieves an unusual affirmation, but the sense of belonging is not for humans, who must suffer—as usual in Merwin—the sense of near revelation blocked by blind human knowledge. Free of the knowledge that is " theirs," the bird can fit and be fulfilled by the unnameable real, that which can only be called " unknown" and " desert" in the words of men. The palpable authority of the bird's voice comes in part from his aphoristic style, but there is something deeper to power the rhetoric. Through a radical displacement of ordinary perspective Merwin can express his customary negation in coldly positive, even triumphant, terms. For once a voyage in a Mer win poem actually ends in fulfillment, and we experience a non human victory where human satisfaction is endlessly impossible, inci</page><page sequence="11">58 Anthony Libby dentally enjoying the leap (again reminiscent of science fiction) into an alien consciousness. We realize the negative implications for us as humans, but that realization comes after the triumphant experience of the poem, an experience of relief, however temporary, from the limits of humanity. Less complicated by paradox, though still based on a literally decep tive anthropomorphism, are those beast poems in which human and animal consciousness do not oppose but blend with each other. Merwin reanimates the ancient mythic tradition of totem animals to provide some relief from the essential human dwindling which is one of the main themes of the poetry and The Miner's Pale Children. As its title suggests, Miner's records a progressive movement away from the natural world of animals into the denatured and dehumanizing realm of technology, a place shaped by the coldest names for things, numbers. The basic fact in " The Animal Who Eats Numbers " is that the numbers are indifferent; " there are just as many of them as there ever were, and everyone says the future is theirs. It's the animal who is disappearing" (Miner's, 81). So it is with the human animal; often fear provides the only evidence of identity: " Once when I looked at myself there was nothing. I could not see any size, any shape, any color. I could tell that I was still there because I was frightened, and I could feel that" (Miner's, 3). The void in the self that fear fills grows larger in our time but began at the beginning, one result of a separation from animals that reads like a romantic version of original sin. " Cuckoo Myth " refers to " the first season " as the time of " the undivided " (Animae, 8); later Merwin would clarify the nature of the division. " Their Week " explains: they believe it was on a Sunday that the animals were divided so that the flood could happen and on a Sunday that we were severed from the animals with a wound that never heals but is still the gate where the nameless cries out (Writings, 22) Our estrangement from the nameless spiritual center causes not only loss of the vital self, but the apocalyptic destructive carelessness about whole animal species that Merwin vengefully condemns in poems like "For a Coming Extinction."</page><page sequence="12">Merwin's Planet: Alien Voices 59 Since division from the animals remains both our sin and our curse, the poet's transforming imagination may logically attempt at least a temporary return to spiritual vitality through psychic contact with beasts. Evan Watkins suggests that Carrier responds to Lice's despair by exploring " the possibility of living one's life as continual trans formation through being observed, being touched, being judged even by what is around us, a recognition that at the very point of personal identity itself there is an otherness which presses continually upon us." 14 The otherness of beasts, though, tends to resist human uses more than Watkins implies. The prose piece " The Chart" describes with some satiric intent a man's attempt to use animals " to complete the fragmentary nature of his consciousness until it was whole at last." He believes that reality manifests itself in sounds he cannot hear because "for understanding he had sacrificed hearing" (Houses, 71); this loss of sensual sensitivity is part of the original severance from the natural world that always, in Merwin, accompanies the develop ment of human knowing. So he domesticates animals and charts what they hear, which of course only leads to more analytic under standing and less hearing. The deep sound of the world remains a mystery; as Merwin puts it, almost hopelessly, in Carrier, " there was never a silence like this//oh objects come and talk with us while you can" (107). If mechanical charting of the range of animal hearing leads only to predictable failure to restore unity to fragmented human consciousness, there are perhaps more intimately psychic ways to establish com munion with the animal world. Merwin's verbal play with titles announces at least the hope for spiritual internalization of beasts. Since Animae consists entirely of animal poems, the unwary reader might easily mistranslate its title, which actually means " souls." Merwin makes the animal-soul equation explicit in the short lyric " Animula," which begins " Look soul " and imagines passage to a place " by the river we/know" where "the nights are not separate/remember" (Carrier, 20)). This place has some of the mythic coloration of death, but there the soul can enjoy an ancient animal union, beyond the exile of selfhood. Since the human self acts as a bar to unity, the dis integration of the self described in many of these poems can be seen as a step on the right path. Merwin's hesitant affirmations almost 11 "W. S. Merwin: A Critical Accomplishment," Boundary 2, 4 (1975), 193.</page><page sequence="13">60 Anthony Libby invariably consist of negations turned upside-down. Sometimes the perspective of fragmentation produces something like the traditional visionary illuminations of lunacy: " I am shown to me/as flies waking in the south walls/emerging from darkness one/at a time" (Carrier, 27). But sometimes the feeling of disintegration is accompanied by intimations of emergence of a new self, not necessarily human. The powerful mythic fantasy described in " Being Born Again " involves anticipation of rebirth into a visionary world dominated by galloping horses, resonant of power. The self's fragmentation is necessary for this potential healing ritual: " I must exist in many forms at a given time, after all, only one of which I think I am used to and have adopted as a convention" (Miner's 46). Only through fragmentation of humanity can the self approach the lost and almost forgotten unity aspired to by the most visionary of Merwin's poems. Though such unity can never actually be achieved, Merwin's only way out of human guilt is to imagine his way out of humanity. So his late poetry constantly presents images of trans formation, and transforming voyages into unknown realms. As Com pass will finally, hopefully, say it, denying the fixity of names, " we are words on a journey/not the inscriptions of settled people" (11). News of this journey has echoed through Merwin's poetry; it involves a search for something unnamed, in a territory as distant as any of the landscapes of science fiction. The one who makes the journey moves away from humanity, of himself and others, to a state of nameless transformation. "Now it is clear" states the paradox that follows one searcher's realization that nature flees his destruction, that as a human he is only " a spine of smoke in the forest." it is clear to me that I cannot return but that some of us will meet once more even here like our own statues and some of us still later without names and some of us will burn with the speed of endless departures and be found and lost no more (Carrier, 109) What is not clear is how—if " I cannot return "—" some of us " can achieve nameless fulfillment out of all the negation, or what we might namelessly become, but the poem carries an odd conviction, not simply because of the aphoristic finality of its last line.</page><page sequence="14">Merwin's Planet: Alien Voices 61 More often Merwin need not evoke the mystery of the end of the search because the journeys he describes are endless or abortive. At times, for instance in " The Hulk," they never seem to begin, as Merwin turns the romantic shore lyric into a song of hopeless waiting. But even " The Hulk's " lonely stasis has an undertone of triumph, as its complete isolation from the human allows immersion in the alien country of silence, namelessness. The hulk is an " iron whale " approaching its own rusty extinction, but the small child who finds it is inhumanly free: "And no one will come/to call me by any name " (Carrier, 82). The one deep way to obtain—in the dream of poetry if not of actuality—relief from humanity and a glimmering of the proper dir ection for the search is to turn to animal consciousness as it would be if equipped with words, names. The animal becomes humanized in the tools of its speculation but not human enough for guilt or shame. As early as "The Herds" or as late as "Grass Beginning July" in Compass, Merwin imagines herds moving in large numbers beyond the time and realm of man: "all of us moving together" (Compass, 72). The alien pleasure of these poems is more complicated than that of " Noah's Raven " because of our initial (probably mistaken) impression that they are voiced by a human who moves with the herds, as the clearly human protagonist of " The Paw" enters into the dream hunts of his paramour "the she-wolf Perdita " (Carrier, 119). In these poems Merwin attempts not the usual surreal use of beasts, like Follain's use of them to dramatize particular human emotions, but something different, a blending of human and imagined non-human patterns of thought. The point is not really to prepare for some evolutionary joining with our Mother and her brood of beasts, though some of Merwin's more bizarre science fiction poems seem to suggest something like that (as Ballard's The Drowned World describes the animalization of its protagonist). Rather his intentions derive from ancient ritual as well as contemporary visions; at their best poems of totem animals become—as he writes of Follain's quite different ones—" parts of a rite, of an unchanging ceremony heralding some inexorable splendor, over a ground of silence." 15 "Words for a Totem Animal" (in Animae and Carrier) may be marked more by silence than splendor, but it offers Merwin's most striking blend of human pessimism and animal 15 "Forward," Transparence, p. vii.</page><page sequence="15">62 Anthony Libby faith. Again, the immediacy of the animal's human voice initially evokes a paradoxical feeling of stangeness and distance. Porchia writes, "You will find the distance that separates you from them, by joining them," 16 and talking animals are a traditional sf device for examining the uniqueness (or isolation) of humans. But the totem animal comes closer to man than " Noah's Raven," or even the supplicant of " Lemuel's Blessing," the earlier poem from Lice and Animae that resembles " Totem " in concept. The totem animal complains that humans falsely take him for " a blessing," that "they bring me/names/that would fit anything" (Animae, 21) but it is never so obsessed with emancipation from man as the dog/wolf in " Lemuel." Nor does he possess the spiritual assurance of beasts and angels that Lemuel shows in his opposition to the human. On his search, Lemuel prays for guidance to " You that know the way/Spirit" (Animae, 11), never despairing of some response; the totem animal receives only " your silence " in answer to its prayer to the "god of beginnings/immortal" (20). Lemuel asks, " Run with me like the horizon," as Merwin creates a beautifully suggestive image, one immediately understandable on the level of common experience; simulaneously it suggests a Spirit who moves with Lemuel (at least in his subjective experience) and one who lives at the end of the quest, perhaps forever receding. This deity includes both self and world, briefly united in moments of vision, so Lemuel can pray: But lead me at times beside the still waters; There when I crouch to drink let me catch a glimpse of your image Before it is obscured with my own (13) The totem animal manages a similar hope, but lacks faith in any satisfaction from a "lord cold as the thoughts of birds" (21). It runs alone, repeating something like " a word in the ear of death... that is the sound of my running the plea plea that it makes which you will never hear oh god of beginnings immortal (20) 19 Porchia, p. 16.</page><page sequence="16">Merwin's Planet: Alien Voices 63 Like Lemuel the totem animal hopes for revelation because revelation, and some vision of union, provides the only genuine basis for identity. Again the desire is for a sound, unnameable. I am never all of me unto myself and sometimes I go slowly knowing that a sound one sound is following me from world to world and that I die each time before it reaches me (22) The spiritual insecurity of the animal, the comparative lack of assurance in his aphoristic style, provide a gauge of his participation in the human. If " Noah's Raven " demonstrates alienation from humanity, " Lemuel " dramatizes a simple animal faith, what Merwin might feel if he were not ashamed of being human. But " Totem " unites the human and non-human to find a way beyond shame and misanthropy, not to some fantasized redemption but to a glimpse of the mystery beneath all conscious life on Merwin's planet. " Totem " as usual suggests the imminence of revelation as well as its elusiveness, but the poem conveys the impression that Merwin may no longer be exclusively concerned with apocalyptic revelation, with whatever " alien blessing/is on its way to us " (Carrier, 75) from whatever alien world. He is no longer so intent on penetrating the heart of mystery, any more than on announcing his suspicion of men, however justified. Rather he looks for a voice far enough from human to respect, but close enough to be shaped in human words, and to shape a clear ritual for our condition. Even in the poems not narrated by animals, Carrier will continue to speak from a little out side the human, will continue to confront our mystery with no answers but a more peaceful clarity. As usual Porchia speaks for all of Mer win: " The mysterious brings peace to my eyes, not blindness." 17 17 Porchia, p. 19.</page></plain_text>
