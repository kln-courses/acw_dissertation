Bowersock Institute for Advanced Study Princeton K.S. olim collegae semper amico In 1875 the collector and scholar Wilhelm Froehner published a short text incised on a gem of red jasper that had been offered to him in Nazareth for possible purchase.1 Of the six lines of this text only the first three have been much cited because they consist of three gods' names, and reference has customarily been not to Froehner's original publication but to Louis Robert's quotation from it in his Collection Froehner of 1936.2 In making an apposite allusion to the Froehner gem in her excellent study of the cults of the Hawran in the Roman period, Dominique Sourdel was under the impression that the great nineteenth-century collector had actually acquired the piece;3 but Froehner himself reports unambiguously that he refused to pay the dealer's price. The object has therefore been lost to the world of schol- arship. Nonetheless Froehner's transcription, entirely baffling to him in its second half, is worth resurrecting in the light of more recent discoveries in the Roman Near East. It bears upon several important cults among the inhabitants of provincia Arabia. 1 Wilhelm Froehner, Melanges d'epigraphie et d'archeologie (Paris: Detaille, 1875) 52-53. 2 Louis Robert, Collection Froehner (Paris: Editions des Bibliotheques Nationales, 1936) 1. 115 n. 3, cited in Dominique Sourdel, Les cultes du Hauran a l'epoque romaine (Paris: Imprimerie Nationale, 1952) 77 n. 2, and in G.

The name Ares poses no orthographical difficulty, but the next two names are both slightly defective. Theandrios is a divinity well known to students of the Hawran in southern Syria and northern Jordan. His name appears consistently as Theandrios, not Theandros, until it gives way to the late antique form, Theandrites.4 Since the first two names appear on the gem in the nominative case, one would expect the third to do the same, and accordingly it looks as if Froehner's transcription should be corrected to Aovo-apr[S], the Greek form of the Nabataean Dushara. If Froehner's eye (or indeed the light in which he was shown the piece) misled him in line three, we might also wish to consider reading line two as OEav8p[do'. As far as I am aware the three final lines have not ever been discussed by anyone, including Froehner himself. To judge from the first three lines, each line of this text contains a single word. The fifth appears to conform to this pattern (hpara-Or) and suggests a magical use for the gem in an erotic context. The fourth and sixth lines, however, seem at first glance impenetrable, but PABON deserves closer scrutiny. The god Theandrios points specifically to the region of the Hawran, and Dusares, the chief god of the Nabataeans, while by no means confined to that territory, was important there (no- tably at Bostra).5 It happens that Rabbos (or Rabos) is well attested in precisely the Hawran as a proper name and thus fits well the indication of the divine names.6 More striking still is the description of Thean- drios on several inscriptions, according to Sourdel's convincing interpretation, as OEbo Pa,8f,ov.7 The god was apparently associated with 4 For full documentation on Theandrios/Theandrites see ibid., 78-81. 5 For Dusares, see Sourdel, Les cultes, 59-68 and, most recently, A.

The primary significance of the second half of the text is thus the appearance of Rabos, confirming the Hawran provenance implied by the divine names. The syntax of the last lines is a separate matter, but some modest speculation may be permissible here. The bizarre fourth line is unlikely to be magical nonsense in view of the perfectly comprehensible words that follow. Since Froehner's transcription can- not be, as we have already noted, wholly accurate, it is legitimate to suspect error in line four; and suspicion falls first upon the alpha, situated oddly between two other vowels. Alpha and lambda are com- monly misread (A and A), and if we read A here the sequence -XEqOu resembles the termination of a Semitic proper name for a woman (-Imt). The preceding vocalization represented by -ou- imposes 5lmt, Shulamith, or in Greek lovE,uA8. If Froehner had misread a sigma as a nu at the beginning of this line, he probably did so because the letter was squeezed close to the edge. The incision may have been similarly confusing at the right edge in line six, where one would not readily accept the barbarism of an accusative after )pdario-. On the other hand, reading Pa/3oq would supply the verb with a subject and leave the indeclinable feminine name as the object of rlpacrOr in an understood genitive. Hence, we may postulate (Z)ovXE/uL I ' lpdai-r I Pa,/o(s). However that may be, we are left with a magical gem of Hawran ori- gin naming a triad of divinities, including the principal Nabatean god (Dusares) and another that was traditionally tied to the name of Rabbos (Theandrios). The third god is the Arabian Ares, who is also associ- ated particularly, but not exclusively, with the Hawran and Jebel Druz. Memories of Ares in this region lingered on, to be reflected in Nonnus's account of Dionysus among the Arabs.8 Ares was regularly assimilated in Syria and Transjordan to the camel-riding war god Arsu,9 and it is presumably Arsu who is represented by Ares on the Nazareth gem. As a camel-rider he appears on the coinage of Bostra,10 and as a 8 See Bowersock, "Arabian Ares." 9 Javier Teixidor, The Pantheon of Palmyra (Leiden: Brill, 1979) 69-71 with pl. XXI.1. A full and admirable account of Arsu by Pascale Linant de Bellefonds may be found in Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae, 2. 615 - 18. 10 The figure on the reverse of the coin which is no. 34 (p. 117) in Kindler's catalogue (above, n. 5) has been universally identified as Dusares, but comparison with the iconog- raphy of Arsu, as it can be conveniently studied in the plates of the LIMC article (above, n. 9), proves incontrovertibly that he is the camel-rider.

The Arabic Arsu was momentarily incorporated into the name of the city during the reign of Elagabalus, when coins proclaim Arsapolis in place of the conventional Areopolis.11 At Bostra, the capi- tal of provincia Arabia and the most important city of the Hawran during the life of the province, the Nabataean Dusares was the recipient of a major cult that had its origins under the Nabataean kings. The god is commemorated on the city's coinage in both aniconic and anthropo- morphic representations. The traditional representation had been a baetyl, but under hellenized Roman rule a handsome Semitic face was created for Dusares, at least from the age of Commodus onwards.12 But the baetyl also continued to be worshiped at Bostra, and coins of Elaga- balus, Decius, and Herennia Etruscilla inscribed with the name of Dusares depict it in company with two smaller baetyls.13 It has been generally acknowledged in recent years that the Dusares of Bostra formed part of a trinity of gods, but a satisfactory identification of the other two has never been made. Milik proposed that Dusares' companions were baetyls of Allath and the deified city of Bostra,14 but, despite Milik's argument for a baetyl of a goddess Bostra at Petra, it remains unlikely that so Hellenic a goddess as polls or tyche appeared in aniconic form, even granted the assimila- tion of tyche with the Semitic gad. Naster, by contrast, has recently suggested al-'Uzza as a substitute for Bostra in the trinity,15 but there is no supporting evidence for annexing this goddess, who is the Arabian Aphrodite, to Dusares and Allath. The Froehner gem is the only tes- timony, so far as I know, for a trinity of Hawran divinities including 11 In "Arabian Ares" I emphasized the novelty of the Arsapolis types in the coinage of Rabbathmoba but had not realized at that time that the element "Arsa" simply represented the Semitic name of the god Arsu, which was pronounced locally as "Arsa."

Coins of Philip show an anthropomorphic Dusares: Kindler no. 43 (p. 121). The simultaneity of the aniconic and anthropomorphic forms can be seen in two coins of Caracalla from 209/10, one with an anthropomorphic Dusares (Kindler no. 29 [p. 114]), the other with an aniconic Dusares (Kindler no. 30 [p. 115]). The obverse die for the two coins is probably the same: Augusto Spijkerman, The Coins of the Decapolis and Provincia Arabia (Jerusalem: Francis- can, 1978) Bostra, 76 (nos. 37 and 38). 14 J. T.

It follows that the two smaller and adjacent baetyls on those coins should represent Ares/Arsu and Theandrios. According to Damascius,16 Theandrites, as Theandrios was called in late antiquity, was worshiped among the Arabs in masculine form (ap- pEVW7rOV Ovra OEOv). But that is no impediment to an aniconic form earlier, and it is quite possible that, just as in the case of Dusares, ani- conic and anthropomorphic representations existed simultaneously. The very name Theandrios deserves attention because it is the only divine name on the Froehner gem for which we cannot be sure of a Semitic equivalent. In dedications to Theandrios set up by Arabs in Pannonia and Mauretania (Volubilis) this god is associated with a north-Arabian deity, Manaf,17 but it is clear that Manaf is a TfrapEpo? (associate) of Theandrios and not identified with him. The Greek word Theandrios is itself remarkable, because, together with related forms, it was used in Christian Greek to express the nature of Christ. Lampe is, however, demonstrably wrong in asserting in his lexicon that the Chris- tians invented the word for this purpose.18 Sourdel justly remarks, "On ne comprend pas comment ce nom, employe par les Chretiens pour designer le Christ, a pu d'abord etre applique a un dieu dont l'origine arabe ne semble pas douteuse."19 We may conclude that at least in the Roman Hawran the Arabs worshiped the traditional Nabataean deity Dusares as part of a trinity. The coins of Bostra prove that two other gods shared the cult with him, and with the help of the Froehner gem those gods may be identified as Theandrios and the Arabian Ares. 16 Damascius, PG 103.1290.
