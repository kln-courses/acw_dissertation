<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN INQUIRY INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPLEX SOCIETY AT CHALCATZINGO, MORELOS, MEXICO: METHODS AND RESULTS Mark E. Harlan The development of social complexity at the Formative period site of Chalcatzingo, Morelos, Mexico, is traced through its effect on the distribution of variability in the anthropomorphic figurines found there. A new methodology for the analysis of stylistic data is applied. The implications of the character and timing of elite developments at Chalcatzingo are placed in the more general context of highland developments in central Mex- ico. It is suggested that complex society arose in the region primarily as a result of internal processes and that external stimulus from the Olmec area was relatively unimportant. THIS PAPER HAS A DUAL PURPOSE. It is both an inquiry into a substantive problem in Mesoamerican prehistory and a discussion of the methodology used for the study. Although the pursuit of both methodological and substantive issues in a single presentation may cause some distractions, this problem is minor in light of the fact that it is not possible to divorce results from technique. A method is best discussed in light of the substantive issues it has helped to illuminate. Further, the consideration of methodology is crucial when evaluating arguments on substantive issues. The substantive aspect of this paper deals with a problem area in the development of complex society in Mesoamerica. The specific issue addressed is the development of social complexity at one Formative period site, Chalcatzingo, Morelos. However, the developments that took place there have implications that go beyond that single site and even beyond the central Mexican region. The development of complex society at Chalcatzingo is traced through its impact on the stylistic variability of the figurines found there. The variability of the figurines has not proved amenable to analysis by the techniques commonly applied to archaeological data. A new methodology was devised, largely by borrowing from existing work in physical anthropology (Sanghvi 1953; Workman 1970; Lalouel 1973). Since this methodology may prove useful in the analysis of com- plex patterns of variability in other archaeological collections, the techniques will be presented in some detail. The main thrust of the presentation remains, however, an inquiry into the Formative period developments at Chalcatzingo and their implications for the rise of social complexity in Mesoamerica. Some of the most critical questions concerning the Formative period in Mesoamerica (ca. 1600-200 B.C.) center on the role of the Gulf Coast Olmec in the process of state formation in the Mexican highlands. There are many specific hypotheses concerning the nature of Olmec in- fluence in the highlands, but most of these can be placed into two opposing camps. On the one side, there are suggestions that the Olmec were directly responsible for all the state-level societies that eventually arose in the highlands (Coe 1960, 1965). The opposite point of view holds that, whatever influence the Olmec may have exercised over their contemporaries, the develop- ment of states in the highland basins must be understood in terms of local conditions and in- digenous developmental processes (Sanders and Price 1968; Sanders 1976). This question has re- mained very much open and will continue in doubt until there is a thorough understanding of the events that preceded state formation in the Mexican highlands. Mark E. Harlan, Office of Contract Archaeology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131 471</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY The highland site of Chalcatzingo, located in the Mexican state of Morelos, provides one piece in the puzzle of Formative period developments (see Grove et al. 1976 for a description of the site and its environs and a discussion of the history of research there). The occupation at Chalcatzingo spans the Formative period, and the main development there dates to the poorly understood period between 1000 and 600 B.C. Further, there is clear evidence that Chalcatzingo's inhabitants were in contact with the Gulf Coast (Grove 1968a, 1968b; Coe 1965; Pifia Chan 1965). If the rise of social complexity at Chalcatzingo can be documented, a knowledge of the character and timing of events there will add to our understanding of the nature of the influence the Olmec exercised over highland societies. If the rise of complex society can be directly tied to the intensity of Olmec con- tact, that contact might be assigned a prime causal role. If, on the other hand, the relationship is not direct, indigenous processes must be considered, and Olmec contact should be viewed as stimulative but not causal. Chalcatzingo has produced extensive evidence for Olmec influence (Grove 1968a, 1968b; Pinia Chan 1965). The evidence is not confined to Chalcatzingo but occurs generally throughout a region that stretches from the Basin of Mexico to the Valley of Oaxaca and from the Gulf Coast to the Pacific (Grove 1968b). Tracing the rise of stratification at Chalcatzingo is more difficult. The bas-relief carvings (executed in a pure Olmec style) and other Olmec artifacts that have been found at the site do not necessarily indicate the presence of a complex society since they may all have been executed by a small band of artisans during a brief period. There are other features at Chalcatzingo that more clearly show an elite presence (preferential treatment of burials, ceremonial platforms, and an altar), but these features do not appear until nearly the end of the occupational sequence. Further, their presence indicates that complexity had arisen but does not document the developmental process. Since there is no evidence that the purely utilitarian items in the site artifact inventory were produced under elite direction (with the possible exception of obsidian tools), the distribution of these artifacts will provide no help. The anthropomorphic figurines do, however, hold some hope for documenting the rise of the community elite. These items are highly variable, and three years' excavation produced more than 5,000 identifiable fragments, which were subjected to an intensive analysis by the author (Harlan 1976). In order to see the Chalcatzingo figurines as indicating an elite development in the society there, a series of assumptions must be made: (1) the figurines served a ritual function; (2) they were produced by specialists, and their iconography was carefully tailored to the intended ritual purpose; and (3) as an elite emerged in the society, they achieved control over the ritual associated with the figurines. None of these assumptions can be fully warranted on the basis of the archaeological record at Chalcatzingo, but some features of the figurines and their distribu- tion on the site do support the premise. Specialist production can be argued on the basis of the uniform quality of the product. Less than 5% of the 5,000 fragments could be called crude. In almost every case, skillful forming, careful finishing, and consistency of depiction are the rule. The consistency of depiction was achieved despite individual hand modeling and the wide range of representations produced. The assumption of ceremonial function is more difficult to support, but the careful disposal ac- corded figurines indicates that they were probably used in ritual. Figurines are seldom found in trash or general fill; the most common associations are with structure floors, ceremonial features, and burial fill. The use of figurines for ceremonial purposes in ethnographically known cultures also supports the assumption. Hereditary elites possess a well-known role in the direction of ritual, including esoteric knowledge and required paraphernalia (Sahlins 1958). To see how one might monitor the presence of such control, however, requires a more detailed consideration of the implications of central direction for the distribution of artifact variability. When facing a problem that involves tracing the distribution of artifacts assumed to come from one or more discrete production sources, there are at least two ways to proceed. One may analyze the raw material, assuming that each production center utilized a different source, or one may analyze the variability of the artifacts. The second approach was chosen for the analysis of the Chalcatzingo figurines for two reasons: (1) since most if not all of the production sources are 472 [Vol. 44, No. 3,1979</page><page sequence="3">DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPLEX SOCIETY assumed to have been within the prehistoric community, it is unlikely that there would be a perfect correspondence between differences in raw material and different manufacturers; (2) under the assumptions presented above, stylistic variability in the Chalcatzingo figurines would actually be iconic and thus tightly tied to figurine function. If it can be shown that the analysis of figurine variability produces discrete clusters of elite and nonelite areas, differential access to figurine iconography existed. An earlier analysis (Harlan 1976) has shown that there are dif- ferences among site areas with respect to diversity in the stylistic elements of their figurines. Fur- ther, these differences are patterned with respect to evidence for elite activities. In the present analysis, a methodological improvement permits a more detailed picture of the development. METHODOLOGY 1. The Nature of the Data Base As discussed in detail elsewhere (Harlan 1975,1976), the Chalcatzingo figurine data consist of observations of a series of attributes and tabulations of their distribution over the provenience units of the site. The attributes are the manifestations in which the various figurine parts occur (i.e., nose forms, eye forms, turban types, etc.). Thus the "variables" or "characters" involved in the study are abstractions, the parts of the figurine on which variability was observed and re- corded. The attributes are the various manifestations in which these characters actually ap- peared. Clearly, the entire study is based on the analysis of stylistic variability, an area of ar- chaeological analysis that is both one of the most fundamental and one of the most poorly understood. As commonly used in archaeology, style is a residual category. One examines a series of ar- tifacts and factors out everything that is related to material of manufacture and mechanical func- tion; the remnant is defined as stylistic. Thus, if one is dealing with pottery, lip form and base diameter might be attributed to mechanical function, and color might result mainly from the choice of base clay; when these are factored out, a series of surface alterations might remain to be relegated to stylistic variability. A careful consideration of this procedure reveals oppor- tunities for confusion. It may be that corrugation on a cooking pot is simply decoration, but it might also be related to heat transfer (mechanical function). Smoothing on a water jar might be done for purely esthetic purposes or to enhance liquid retention. These subtle distinctions become major problems when dealing with anthropomorphic figurines. If style is defined by elimination, it is difficult to specify where function stops and style begins in figurine variability. Under a purely mechanical view of function, all the variability in the Chalcatzingo figurines must be assigned to material of manufacture and "style," since none of the pieces doubled as a planter or a pencil holder. This line of reasoning leads to an impasse. If the figurines have no functional variability, does this mean that they had no function? If they truly were not used for anything, why were they made? Clearly, figurines must have had some use, and their function must constrain their variability. Thus, when the concept of function is not confined to mechanical use, the distinction between functional and stylistic variability breaks down. Style cannot be used as a residual category, at least not in the analysis of the Chalcatzingo figurines and possibly not at all. If there is no firm line between functional and stylistic variability, it is legitimate to ask how figurine function has conditioned figurine variability. An answer to the question can be sug- gested, following the assumption of ceremonial function stated above. If the assumption is cor- rect, at least some of the variability of the figurines is actually "iconic" (i.e., related to the ideological information coded onto them). Analogies from the material culture correlates of known religions come readily to mind. A statue of a female with child can be recognized as the Virgin Mary if it is standing on a globe with its foot on the head of a serpent; a particular Katchina can be recognized by the mask and ritual paraphernalia depicted on it; and so on. The assumed iconic nature of the stylistic variability in the Chalcatzingo figurines provides the basis for inferences concerning the development of stratification in the prehistoric community. Harlan] 473</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY The fundamental assumption is that changes in the pattern of variability of figurines reflect changes in the role of the emerging elite in their production and distribution. Given this view of stylistic variability, attention can be shifted to the units within which it was analyzed. Before any detailed discussion of the analytical units, a brief discussion of the general strategy may be useful, particularly in light of the technical nature of the remainder of this discus- sion of methodology. In broad outline, the strategy is quite simply to identify discrete areas of the site that seem to have formed meaningful units in terms of the past behavior of the community and to ask the questions "how do they differ in terms of their figurine content?" and "how do the differences pattern with respect to the presumed nature of the past activities?" A lack of pattern is inter- preted as indicating that there were erfew if any barriers to the free flow of figurines and/or infor- mation on the manufacture of particular depictions. If a pattern can be discerned, it is interpreted as the result of such a barrier's having come into existence. Further, if the pattern of similarities and differences in figurine content can be overlaid on the nature of presumed past activities, the two together may provide insight into how and when the structure of the prehistoric community changed. At this point the nature of the archaeological units that formed the analytical study units can be considered. The basic units of analysis are provided by 37 discrete excavation areas at Chalcatzingo. Ap- pendix I presents a brief description of each area, and more detailed information is available elsewhere (Cyphers 1975; Grove et al. 1976; Harlan 1975). Although each area has a unique character, several common themes can be seen. First, there is a set of areas that, at some point in their occupational history, were utilized by the community elite. These are identified in Appendix I by underlining and an asterisk. The areas so indicated are places where the elite lived, where storage facilities are found closely associated with elite residences, and where elite burials oc- cur. A second set of areas, labeled with an asterisk in Appendix I, might be called ceremonial. This set includes Terrace 25, where an altar was built late in the Middle Formative, and Terrace 15W, which produced a platform with associated stela, also apparently dating to Late Middle Formative times. Another easily recognized group of areas consists of parts of the site that show no evidence of either elite usage or ceremonial activity. These areas are mainly simple structures located on one end of an agricultural terrace. They are unmarked in Appendix I. Each of the final set of areas, marked by a double asterisk, has a character of its own. This group includes Terrace 15, where the Classic period ball court was found; Terrace 37, which may have been a specialized locus for production of ceramic bowls; and Terrace 24, which may have been a figurine manufacturing area. These areas actually have little in common, and the use of a single symbol to denote them does not imply that they form a cohesive group. A description of the attributes and full tabulation of frequencies by area are available elsewhere (Harlan 1976). These data are sufficient to recreate the entire analysis presented here. In a study that seeks differences and similarities among 37 site areas on the basis of differen- tial occurrence of 143 attribute states, there is no hope of perceiving the pattern by direct inspec- tion. The G2 distance technique was chosen as the means of reducing the complexity to a manageable form. There are two reasons for this choice: (1) the method has the capacity to reduce a complex pattern of relationships to a simple form, and (2) the assumptions made by the measure have an excellent fit to the character of the Chalcatzingo figurine data. 2. The Applic(tion of G2 Distance G-square is a technique for the analysis of contingency tables (discontinuous measures) developed by Sanghvi (1953). It is a member of the family of measures based on chi-square but should not be confused with the G2 log-linear reduction of contingency tables discussed by Clark (1976) and Spaulding (1977). The standard treatment of chi-square (Blalock 1972; Thomas 1976) makes this measure appear uninteresting for an analysis that involves clustering site areas 474 [Vol. 44, No. 3,1979</page><page sequence="5">DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPLEX SOCIETY because it is usually presented only as a measure of statistical independence. However, as Kurc- zynski (1970) has demonstrated, statistical independence is only one dimension measured by chi- square. It is also a distance measure. Workman (1970) discusses the relationship between chi- square distance and measures of biological distance. When one uses a contingency table analysis to generate distance values, a departure from the textbook presentation is required. The goal of the analysis is not one grand measure of in- dependence for the whole contingency table but rather individual measures of distance for each pair of units examined (in this case, site areas). This simply means that the tables are always 2 x N, and the analysis proceeds pairwise, making all possible nonredundant comparisons. Chi-square itself is not an appropriate statistic for the analysis of the Chalcatzingo figurines (although it almost certainly is for some other bodies of archaeological data). The feature of the Chalcatzingo data that renders chi-square inappropriate is that the site areas were differentially sampled. Chi-square is sensitive to such differences because cell expectations are based on both row totals (total count by site area) and column totals (sum of the attribute for the two areas com- pared). This means that any two units with widely divergent sample sizes are not comparable. It should be noted that, if the excavated samples at Chalcatzingo had been scaled to the actual size of the areas, chi-square would be an appropriate statistic. Sanghvi's (1953) G2 deals effectively with the problem of differential sample size. In this method the row totals (the totals for site areas) are arbitrarily set to unity, and the attribute fre- quencies are scaled to match. Row totals are ignored in computing expected values, and dif- ferences in sample size make no direct contribution to differences between units. Thus one is bas- ing the measure of distance on differences in proportion. Workman's (1970) computational for- mula, simplified from Sanghvi's, is N N (Pij - P'ij)2 G = E 1 i=1 j=l1 (Pij + P'ij) where P.. is the relative frequency (proportion) of the jth attribute in the ith case and P' is the relative frequency of the jth attribute in the case it is compared to. The double summalion in- dicates that the process is repeated for all attributes and all nonredundant pairs. Actual com- putation was performed by a computer program written by the author. Two refinements of the data are required in conjunction with the application of the G2 distance technique to the Chalcatzingo figurine data. First, temporal control must be introduced to monitor the developmental process. Second, any noniconic characters must be identified and eliminated from the analysis, or the noise factor they introduce may distort the pattern beyond recognition. There are two fundamentally different approaches to introducing temporal control. One method is to sort the provenience units of the site into temporally pure lots and include only those from a particular time span in each analysis. Another is to identify which stylistic elements were in use during a particular time period. When searching for differences among site areas during a particular period, only the stylistic elements that were in use at that time are considered. Although the first approach is more direct, it was necessary to use the second for analysis of the Chalcatzingo figurines because of the badly mixed character of many of the proveniences, a result of reuse during occupation and erosion since site abandonment. An insistence that only temporally pure lots be analyzed would leave very few data. In addition to the problem of mixing, there are also difficulties presented by the fact that the figurines do not have a continuous and uniform distribution over the site but are confined to specific contexts, as indicated above. These problems required that a nonconventional approach to temporal control be used. The solution to this problem has been to treat the site as one large, badly disturbed excavation unit. It is assumed that all strata are mixed but that there is a statistical tendency for earlier at- tributes to occur in the lower strata and for later attributes to be most abundant in the upper strata. Stated another way, if a given attribute was in use throughout the occupation of Chalcat- Harlan] 475</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY zingo, it should be uniformly distributed through the strata. Any departure from a uniform distribu- tion may be taken to indicate that an attribute was more popular at some times than at others. The problem, then, is to sort out the actual differences from those that result from sampling error. Since no technique was found in the literature, a new one was devised. The operation of the method can be seen by considering a set of matrices and vectors. The pro- cess begins with the matrix of attribute frequencies over levels for any one character. This is con- verted to percentages by dividing individual cell counts by row totals (attribute frequencies per level over total count for the attribute). This matrix of row percentages is designated A. Another matrix, L, is derived from the raw matrix by using the column totals as divisors. This matrix con- sists of the percentages that an attribute contributes to its variable total for a given level. The two matrices of percentages are treated as "observed" values. The expected values for the matrix A are derived by the formula: ai = (ti/N) x 100, where ti is the row total for the raw matrix and N is the number of columns in A (the number of levels). The expected values for the matrix L, designated ii, are the percentages that each stratum contributes to the total of proveniences excavated at the site. A matrix, Z, of scores for deviations from expected values for each attribute can be generated by the formula: Zij = (aij - a.i) + (ij - l.i)- There are two sets of deviations from expected values incorporated into the matrix Z, because treatment of the entire site as a single unit creates two separate sets of expectations. Only depar- ture from both represents an actual departure from uniformity. First, there is the expectation that an attribute state that rarely occurs will constitute only a small part of any stratum, even one that represents deposition during a period when the attribute was at its greatest popularity. These deviations are measured in the matrix A.he second set of deviations measures the behavior of individual attributes. The question asked is "do the majority of the occurrences for this attribute fall in the deepest (earliest) strata or in the upper (later) strata?" Since the upper strata were much more heavily sampled, this must be taken into account. These are the deviations from expec- tations, corrected for differential sampling, that are measured in the matrix L. For ease of interpretation, it is possible to graph each attribute's deviations. Inflection points on the curve will indicate in which levels an attribute is well above or below its expected value. Ex- amination of the graphs resulted in a five-part division of the time span, which was collapsed into three periods so that the maximum number of characters could be retained in analysis. 3. The Removal of Noniconic Characters The identification of noniconic characters (which should be removed from the analysis) was based on the premise that iconic characters, by definition, convey information. In order to form a message, the combination of iconic characters must, therefore, be redundant. This redundancy can be perceived by correlating the contribution of each character to the total G2 distance be- tween site areas. The required redundancy of iconic characters should cause them to intercor- relate much more highly than characters that are noniconic and thus may vary without respect to the requirements of information transmission. Pearson's r was used as the measure of association since G2 distance is a continuous variable. The overall intercorrelation matrix was reduced to a series of two-dimensional plots by Lalouel's method (1973), which is discussed below. The individual plots for each period are presented in Figures 1, 2, and 3. While none of these plots presents truly tight clusters, they do give an indica- tion of which characters are iconic and which are not. The characters removed from each analysis are indicated by an asterisk in the respective plots. An examination of Figures 1, 2, and 3 will show that there are differences both in the overall form of the distributions and in which characters are retained or removed for each period. These dif- 476 [Vol. 44, No. 3,1979</page><page sequence="7">DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPLEX SOCIETY i FRRMS P LE35 EYES .MOUTHS ERR NRVELS .ORNRMENTS CLOTHINE TURBRNS t III I I I NECK ORNRMENTS .iRERSTS TURBRN BUTTONS.

The Early period plot (Figure 1) shows all but two characters loosely strung out along an imag- inary line that could be drawn through the points representing mouths, navels, ear ornaments, and turbans. The Middle period plot (Figure 2) shows one cluster on the left of the X axis, which has been interpreted to include turban forms, although this may not be correct. The close proximi- ty of turban embellishments and pregnancy forms has been defined as another cluster, an inter- pretation influenced by the fact that these two characters also show a close association in the Early period plot. The remainder of the Middle period characters seem to be more widely scat- tered, although all but clothing types fall within quadrant I of the plot. The Late period plot shows one loose cluster with its center near the point occupied by turban embellishments. The inclusion of mouth forms and the exclusion of leg forms from this cluster may be questionable. The patterns seem to suggest a tendency to code the information conveyed by figurine depictions into a smaller number of characters in the later periods. This impression is reinforced by considering which characters are included in and excluded from each period.

Plot of the correlation of contributions to G2 distance by the figurine characters using at- tributes associated with the Middle period. In the Early period, only arm and leg forms were removed from analysis. This is not surprising since the arms and legs of Early period figurines, mainly types D and K from Vaillant's (1931) typology, are nearly invariate. Their contributions to distance, therefore, are correlated with one another but not with those of the more variable characters. In the Middle period, three body parts (legs, arms, and eyes) were removed from analysis. Three aspects of embellishment were also removed (clothing, neck ornaments, and turban but- tons). The elimination of the three body parts may indicate a tendency to encode key information into externals, such as the wrapping of the turban or its embellishments, rather than the body parts themselves. The elimination of clothing and neck ornaments does not really negate this trend; while these features occur on Middle period figurines, they are relatively rare and thus may be expected to make a sporadic contribution to total distance between site areas. The elimination of turban buttons is certainly not due to rarity, since they are quite common on Middle period figurines. It may be noted, however, that turban buttons seem to be applied almost whim- sically, vary greatly in the number found on a single turban, and commonly occur in several varieties on the same turban. They may have been "decorative" in the pure sense. 478 [Vol. 44, No. 3,1979</page><page sequence="9">DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPLEX SOCIETY TURERNS 9 EYES D BRERSTS NECK ORNfMENTS CLDTH I NS t I I I I I I TURBRN BUTTONS 9$ RRMS * LESS TURBRlN MOUTHS .

The pattern that appears tentatively in the Middle period emerges more strongly in the Late period. All the characters eliminated from analysis are body parts, with the single exception of turban forms. It may be noted that Late period figurines, which are mainly type C-8 in Vaillant's (1931) typology, do not display nearly the variability in turban forms seen in the Early and Middle periods, although they are more variable with respect to ornamentation generally. The end product of all of the processes just described is a set of distance values expressing the differences between each pair of site areas. Since the distances are sums of the G2 values for all iconic characters (appropriately adjusted for the degrees of freedom associated with each character), they express the differences and similarities between each pair of site areas in terms of the stylistic differences and similarities of the figurines found within them. 4. Achieving a Simple Solution If the number of cases (site areas) had been small, analysis could have stopped here. The distance scores could have been inspected and a rough ranking generated. This was not possible in the Chalcatzingo figurine analysis since the 37 site areas generate 666 nonredundant pairs. A Harlan] 479</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY method is needed to reduce the 36-dimensional N-space to an order that can be understood, preferably a 2-space that can be plotted. The mathematics of this problem have been attacked by J. M. Lalouel (1973). In Lalouel's ap- proach the first step is to convert the distances to their mirror image similarity values. This is done because, while a similarity matrix can be reduced by finding its complete eigenstructure, the zeroes on the principal diagonal of a distance matrix make it much harder to reduce. Lalouel (1973:139) suggests the following equation to express the relationship between distance and similarity: dij2 = aii + a - 2aij where dij2 is the distance and the values of a are elements in the similarity matrix. There is no mathematical guarantee that this will produce an optimal representation, but it worked well in the Chalcatzingo analysis and will probably prove equally applicable to most archaeological data. The product of the transform is a symmetric matrix with unities on the principal diagonal ( + 1.0 is the theoretical upper limit of the similarity transform) and values in the off-diagonal positions that are inversely proportional to their corresponding distance values. (The theoretical lower limit is - oo but, in applications based on G2, it will seldom exceed -1.0.) Once the similarity matrix has been generated, its eigenstructure will present a reduced space solution. However, use of the raw similarity matrix is inadvisable. As Lalouel points out, each variable in the matrix (i.e., each site area) is positioned on a unique coordinate system. To achieve an optimum reduced space solution, it is desirable to have all the variables on the same coor- dinate system, with its origin at the centroid of the whole point swarm. Lalouel suggests the following transform to achieve a matrix of this form: bij = ai - a j + a., where b^ is the element of the transformed matrix, ai is the mean element of the ith row of the raw matrix, a , is the mean element of the jth column, and a is the grand mean of the raw matrix. In addition to producing a matrix of the desired form, the motion is rigid (distance conservative) since the relation bii + bjj - 2bij = aii + ajj - 2aij holds. The complete eigenstructure of his transformed matrix can then be found in the conventional manner (a tridiagonal Q-R algorithm was used in this study, but the method is irrelevant). A two- dimensional solution was achieved by plotting the eigenvectors associated with the second and third largest eigenvalues. This maximizes the variance included while ignoring the variance associated with the largest eigenvalue, which is primarily a factor of sheer magnitude (Lalouel 1973). Reducing all the relationships among the distance measures to two dimensions has one effect that is desirable and another that is unfortunate. The unfortunate effect is that some of the original information is inevitably lost. The extent of this loss for the Chalcatzingo figurine analysis can be determined by examining Appendix II. The desirable aspect is that, with the relationships reduced to two dimensions, site areas can be compared with respect to actual, on-the-ground distances and their distances in the space determined by variability in figurines. To expand further on this concept, we may take the view that there are two kinds of space in which the site areas are located. One of these spaces is formed by the actual locations of the areas, and positions in this space give the physical distances that separated past activities. There is another kind of space that is determined by the activities that took place in the physical loca- tions. Two areas of a community that are quite close together physically may be far apart in terms 480 [Vol. 44, No. 3, 1979</page><page sequence="11">DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPLEX SOCIETY of the behavior of the people who occupied and used them. One aspect of this second kind of space is monitored by the figurine variability. There are two ways to observe the differences between physical and variable space. One is to correlate physical distance and variable distance. This has the advantage that no information is lost, but it produces only a single grand measure of similarity. Another way to make comparisons is to plot relative positions in the two kinds of space. Information is lost, but specific positions of individual areas can be seen. Both kinds of comparisons will be provided here. Observation of dif- ferences in the positions of site areas in the two kinds of space forms the basis for discussion of emerging elite control over the production and distribution of figurines at Chalcatzingo.

There are only a few cases where even two areas plot closer to one another than they do to the remainder. The one known Early period residence area from the Plaza Central (PC6) does not fall particularly close to the one known Early period ceremonial feature, a platform mound (PC7). The three segments of Terrace 25 (T25a will hold the altar in a later period) do fall in the same general area of the plot, but this pattern of close proximity in both physical and variable space does not extend to the plot as a whole. Inspection of Figure 4 and Figure 7 gives an intuitive impression that figurine variability tends to place site areas in positions rather different from their physical locations. The intuitive impression is formal- ized by the product-moment correlation between G2 distance and physical distance. The regres- sion yields a correlation coefficient of 0.1982, a weak relationship that accounts for only 3.928% of the variance. This is definitely not the result of a departure from linearity, since the regression of variable distance on physical distance was scatter plotted for each period. When interpreted under the assumptions presented above, the meaning of this pattern (or lack 482 [Vol. 44, No. 3,1979</page><page sequence="13">DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPLEX SOCIETY TI1 TI , N7- T2S T~- 9T277R T275 T23 TZO T20 TSE PC7 TX TZZB? , TZI PC' PC2 PCN T2SC - '- EfR . .

There was no central control over the production and distribution of figurines. There are differences in the figurines found in the various areas since there are distances be- tween them in variable space, but these differences do not pattern with respect to any other features of the archaeological record (not even the physical distance between areas). This situa- tion is consistent with an assumption that the community at Chalcatzingo was essentially egalitarian, a conclusion further reinforced by an apparent lack of elite residence areas or burials in the Early period. Access to particular aspects of figurine iconography would have been determined by a variety of factors, such as kinship ties and traditional relationships. Operating together, perhaps often in opposite directions, these forces generate what appears to be a random distribution. At first glance, the Middle period plot seems similar to the Early period. However, a closer ex- amination of Figure 5 indicates that this is not the case. First, there are tendencies toward clustering. Several of the Plaza Central areas and their neighbors are clumped near the center right of the plot. In the center left, a loose cluster of nonelite, nonceremonial areas is seen.

See Appendix I for an explanation of the abbreviations used. areas are still scattered over the plot. Among these is Terrace 24, the possible figurine manufac- turing area that plots at a considerable distance from the elite residence areas. The area that plots closest to Terrace 24 is Terrace 25a, a near neighbor in physical space as well. The correlation between G2 distance and physical distance is, again, interesting. The value for the Middle period is 0.4133, not a powerful relationship but much stronger than in the Early period (17.081% of the variance in distance is accounted for). Thus, as incipient clusters are form- ing, there is a weak tendency for physical neighbors to become neighbors in variable space as well. Given the members of the incipient clusters, it is reasonable to see this pattern as the begin- ning of elite development in the prehistoric community. The space defined by access to figurine iconography, which had been totally open in the Early period, is now partly partitioned. It would seem that the elite were present but not yet in firm control of the community. Given this conclu- sion, it is interesting to note that, while exceptionally large residences and rich burials indicate elite zones in the Middle period, none of the formal ceremonial features (the altar and platforms with associated stelae) had yet been built. 484 [Vol. 44, No. 3,1979</page><page sequence="15">DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPLEX SOCIETY In looking at the plot for the Late period (Figure 6), it is apparent that something very different is going on. Two clusters are seen, to the left and right of center. The cluster to the right of center is composed almost entirely of nonelite areas that are physically distant from elite areas. The cluster to the left of center contains elite areas and their near physical neighbors. The figurine manufacturing area (T24) is now placed in the elite cluster in G2 space. The altar and burial area associated with it (T25A and T25b) are slightly removed from the elite cluster but closer to it than to the nonelite grouping. The same holds true for the caves, which were probably used for ritual purposes. Scattered around at considerable distances from the main clusters are some of the areas with special characters. The Early period residence area from the Plaza Central (PC6) is also isolated, possibly because it was not reused. The correlation between G2 distance and physical distance in the Late period is 0.0603 (0.360% of the variance is accounted for). The reason for this very low correlation is that physical distance now has no real import for differences and similarities in figurine content. The character of the figurines found in an area is determined by the area's character, not its position in physical space. This pattern is consistent with the assumption that the elite had developed as a distinct group that controlled the production and distribution of figurines. During this same period the formal ceremonial features were built. The fact that the areas that contain these features do not fall in the elite cluster would seem to indicate that they were used by the whole community, not just the elite. The character and timing of the rise of an elite group at Chalcatzingo have im- portant implications for the questions raised at the beginning of this paper. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPLEX SOCIETY IN THE MEXICAN HIGHLANDS Before consideration of the panregional implications of the development inferred above, some attention should be given to the actual character of the "elite" (those presumed to have been in control of figurine production and distribution). On the basis of the figurine data alone, they may have been anything from Polynesian-style chiefs to Melanesian-type Big Men or just a clique of ar- tisans and religious specialists within an essentially egalitarian community. Consideration of other aspects of the archaeological record at Chalcatzingo is helpful in distinguishing among these alternatives. The first fact to note is that the elite occupation zones were utilized over extended time periods. The main elite zone in the Plaza Central was in use throughout the Middle Formative. Thus the elite group itself probably had continuity for some 300 years or more. Second, the public works (mainly the ceremonial features at the site) are not indicative of an ability to command large labor groups. It does not require more than a dozen men to move any of the individual components of the monuments. The continuity in the elite groups seems indicative of ascribed rather than achieved status. It is likely, then, that elite group recruitment was mainly by birth. Thus the prehistoric society was clearly "ranked" (Fried 1967) and was probably on the road to stratification although, as Fried points out, the distinction between ranking and stratification is subtle in practice, even when dealing with ethnographically documented cultures. This much is clear: an elite came into ex- istence at Chalcatzingo during the Formative period occupation of the site and achieved control of at least some aspects of the society there. Specification of the exact nature of the elite group must await further research. Before any conclusions can be drawn that go beyond internal developments at Chalcatzingo, the three periods used in this discussion must be placed in absolute time. This is a difficult under- taking, and the problem hinges on the way the periods were originally defined. As stated above, the definitions were based on subsets of attributes, which were determined by differential distribution over the strata of the whole site. This means that the attribute sets cannot be dated directly by their associations with provenience units of known periods. The dates suggested here are based on a series of comparisons between stylistic attributes and the traditional whole piece typology (Vaillant 1931). These are independent, since the attributes that define the original types Harlan] 485</page><page sequence="16">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY overlap only slightly with the stylistic attributes used in this study. The traditional types are, in turn, placed in time by their stratigraphic distribution at Chalcatzingo and by comparisons with other collections (additional discussion is presented in Harlan 1976). On the basis of these comparisons, the following correspondences are suggested. The Early period is essentially Early Formative and covers the time between 1200 and 900 B.C. The Middle and Late periods are subdivisions of the Middle Formative (900-600 B.C.), the Late period falling very near the end of that 300-year span. These divisions are in reasonably close correspondence with the independently derived phases A, B, and C used by Grove et al. (1976). If the correspondences presented above are correct, the development of Chalcatzingo's elite began around 900 B.C., and the process was a gradual one that took 300 years to complete. There was probably a fully developed elite in firm control of the community by 600 B.C. It is difficult to assess how long they remained in control, since the abandonment of the ceremonial and elite areas is not firmly fixed, but 200 years might not be an unreasonable estimate. Placed in a regional context, then, an elite arose at Chalcatzingo after San Lorenzo had been abandoned and shortly before the decline of La Venta, at a time when external influences on central Mexico were shifting away from the Gulf Coast and toward the region north of the Basin of Mexico. Given this set of correspondences, it is difficult to view the development of an elite at Chalcat- zingo as the transplantation of a similar organization from the Gulf Coast. Indeed, given the character of the evidence for elite activities in the two regions, one might argue that the organiza- tions themselves were rather differently based. It is, of course, not is, of course, not possible to deny dthe existeny the existence of Gulf Coast contact throughout most of the Early and Middle Formative. The role of that contact in the process of increasing social complexity can, however, be questioned. The Olmec were cer- tainly a presence in the Mexican highlands, but they cannot provide a full explanation for the rise of complex society there. It must be noted that the conclusions presented here differ somewhat from those reached by one of my colleagues on the Chalcatzingo project (Hirth 1978). While we would agree that com- plexity was a highland response rather than a lowland transplant, we differ on the question of when stratification arose. Hirth places the development considerably earlier than I have (perhaps by 1400 B.C.). Since the details of his criteria have not been presented, this discrepancy can only be noted, not resolved. The rise of social complexity at Chalcatzingo, then, best fits an internal model. What had been an egalitarian society in the Early Formative became a ranked or stratified society in the course of the Middle Formative. If the time frame is expanded beyond the main occupation of Chalcat- zingo into the Late Formative and if one takes a more regional view, the lack of a direct connec- tion between influence from the Gulf Coast Olmec and the development of complexity in the high- lands is even clearer. Cuicuilco arose in the Basin of Mexico when that area was out of contact with the Gulf Coast and influence came mainly from the north (Porter-Weaver 1972). The only connection between the complex society that arose in Oaxaca and the Olmec is the tenuous stylistic link between the danzantes at Monte Alban and the Gulf Coast carving style. If there are no direct connections between these Late Formative highland societies and the Olmec, the states that formed early in the Classic period must be viewed as indigenous developments. IMPLICATIONS OF THE METHODOLOGY The methodology used in the analysis of the Chalcatzingo figurines will be unfamiliar to the ma- jority of archaeologists, even those working in the same basic problem area of stylistic analysis. The innovation has not been introduced for its own sake but rather because it represents a substantial improvement over techniques used in the past. This assertion can be supported by dis- cussing specific points of difference between the G2 distance method and techniques of the prin- cipal components family, such as factor analysis and discriminant function analysis. Despite numerous applications and discussions of techniques from the principal components family (Hill 1966, 1970; Binford and Binford 1966; Cowgill 1968; Schiffer 1973; Doran and Hodson 1966; Calabrese 1972; to mention only a few), an uneasiness has remained concerning the use of 486 [Vol. 44, No. 3,1979</page><page sequence="17">DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPLEX SOCIETY these methods. The source of the difficulties seems to lie in the fact that the statistical assump- tions made by the principal components model fit poorly with many archaeological data, par- ticularly in the area of stylistic analysis. A first step in the application of principal components-based techniques is the generation of a matrix, which is reduced to create a simplified representation of the underlying variability. This is also the first step in a G2 analysis, but the assumptions that underlie the derivation of the values in the matrices are totally different. In a factor analysis, the initial matrix consists of Pear- son's r (product-moment) correlations, each of which is the square root of the shared variance in the two units compared. The initial matrix used in discriminant analysis is itself the product of two other matrices, one containing within-group variances and the other between-group variances for groups defined by the investigator. There are two assumptions made by these statistics: (1) the underlying measure is assumed to be continuous, and (2) the variables are as- sumed to be independent. These requirements are seldom met by archaeological data and are probably never met in stylistic analysis. Since most analyses of style are based on the observation of design attributes, they involve a discrete, not a continuous, measure. If one attempts to approximate a continuous measure by con- verting the frequencies to percentages (as Binford and Binford [19661 suggest), problems with swamping or exaggeration of rare variates may arise. It should also be clear that attributes will never satisfy the requirement for statistical independence, since the occurrence of any attribute will condition the probability of occurrence of any other attribute of the same character. The presence of nonin ndpendent variates in a correlation matrix renders any factor solution based on it highly unreliable. The G2 method does not encounter these problems. The method assumes a discrete measure and treats attributes as such, rather than as independent variables. A further desirable feature is that the method makes no assumptions about expected results. It is merely a tool for perceiving pattern if pattern exists. It is an often noted fact that a factor analysis will create factors, regard- less of the input. CONCLUSIONS This paper has presented an attempt to improve understanding of a problem area in Meso- american prehistory. The attempt has been aided by development and application of a method- ology well suited to the problem and the data. It would be more than pretentious, however, to assert that the substantive issue has been resolved or that the analytical methods should be adopted wholesale. On the methodological side, it must be emphasized that the techniques discussed have only limited applications. This is ensured by the fact that a careful attempt has been made to tailor the methods to the specific problems discussed. At the same time, the general form of the Chalcat- zingo figurine data is close to that often encountered in archaeological analyses. There is an equal need for caution when evaluating the substantive contribution. While the results have important implications for interpreting the course of cultural evolution in Meso- america, they are also indeterminate. The view of figurine variability is internally consistent but lacks the support that only a clear knowledge of figurine function can provide. This is not a proWb- lem that additional archaeological research can solve. Until data are gathered from ethnograph- ically known figurine collections and used to illuminate the relationship between the function of figurines and their physical form, all archaeological research in this area will remain specula- tive. To generalize even further, the problem is that we know very little about the material culture adjuncts of ideological systems. However, while this problem is limiting at the present time, it is certainly amenable to research by techniques currently available. Acknowledgments. The help of Linda S.

Appendix I. Area Descriptions. Area Description T9b Terrace 9b is an agricultural terrace. The majority of the excavated material pertains to a three-room structure on the north end. AA Area A is immediately adjacent to T9b. It produced some evidence of structure that was very poorly preserved. T01 Terrace 1 is an agricultural terrace. No preserved structure has been found, but burials and midden indicate that this was a residential area. T04** Terrace 4 contained a complex of rooms on the east side of the terrace. The presence of a substantial amount of Classic period ceramics and a lime kiln indicates that the structures may have been built after the Formative, but extensive Formative period ceramics and figurines show a substantial Formative occupation as well. T06** Terrace 6 is an agricultural terrace that produced a platform and two stelae. However, this feature was excavated after the figurine analysis had been completed, and the material in- cluded in this study is general fill. The majority of the T06 figurines are Early period, while the ceremonial features are Late period. T11 Terrace 11 is an agricultural terrace that is directly west of the elite residence zones of the Plaza Central. In Late period times, a large (10 x 10 m) structure was built there. T15** T15 is an agricultural terrace that produced a badly destroyed structure. A ball court was built there during the Classic. T15W* T15W is a separate area on the west side of terrace 15, where a platform was found in association with the stela known as "Grove's post." T20 T20 is an agricultural terrace with a 2 x 3 m structure that appears to have been a Classic period house. T21 A number of walls were found on Terrace 21 that may have been either the retaining walls of the terrace or the foundation of a structure. A midden deposit indicates residential usage. T23 T23 is an agricultural terrace with numerous superimposed wall lines that indicate three Middle Formative structures, one of which had a firepit in the center. T24** T24 is an agricultural terrace that produced a possible structure wall and the badly de- stroyed remains of a staircase. This terrace is identified as a possible figurine manufacturing area, because of the abundance of figurines found there (more per provenience unit exca- vated than anywhere else on the site) and because the full range of figurine variability can be seen in this one restricted area. T25a* This terrace produced the single most impressive ceremonial feature on the site, an altar built up of stone slabs with a jaguar mask carved in low relief on the front. The altar dates to late Middle Formative, but use of the terrace predates its construction. T25b** This is an area immediately north of the altar that produced a series of burials. Stratigraphic evidence indicates that the burials were associated with the altar. T25c** T25c is an area of residential structures found 40 m north of the altar. These were built after the altar, possibly when it was no longer in use. T27a and b Areas T27a and T27b are two parts of a large agricultural terrace. Abundant evidence of residential activity was found there. T29** Found on this terrace was a massive wall construction, which extends over into the area near the altar. The function of the construction remains problematical. T31 The minor excavations carried out on Terrace 31 make it difficult to characterize, but it was most probably a nonelite residential zone. T37** This area produced a high concentration of worked and unworked obsidian and was almost certainly a workshop. T39** T39 is a problematical area with some wall remains. N5 and N7 Areas N5 and N7 are located on the northern boundary of the site near a permanent stream. They produced no evidence of structure but did contain abundant Early Formative ceramics and figurines. Cl, C4, and C8*The three caves, designated Cl, C4, and C8, occur in the limestone cliffs of the Cerro del Chalcatzingo above the site. They have seen a variety of uses beginning in the Early Forma- tive and extending to the present. A structure in C8 and paraphernalia in Cl and C4 indicate a ceremonial usage during at least part of the Formative. ER** This designation pertains to a series of exploratory excavations that were carried out to trace the course of the El Rey drainage. The drainage originates in the cerro south of the site and flows down past the east side of the Plaza Central. The materials found there were almost certainly redeposited from up-slope. 488 [Vol. 44, No. 3, 1979</page><page sequence="19">DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPLEX SOCIETY Appendix I. (Continued). Description Area Plaza Central PC1* PC2, 3, and 4* PC5* PC6** PC7* PCN** HZ** TX** PC1 is an area on the south side of the Plaza Central bordering on the El Rey drainage. This is an area of small (2 x 3 m) rooms with a high concentration of figurines and unusual ceram- ics. It may have been a storage area for the residence areas in PC2, PC3, and PC4. This area, adjacent to PC1, contained large rooms and richly accompanied subfloor burials. The area was almost certainly an elite residence zone in the Middle and Late periods. PC5 is a small area just east of the zone discussed above. It may simply be an extension of the same complex, but excavations were not carried out in the intervening area. PC6 is a residential zone on the south side of the Plaza Central platform mound. Both ceram- ics and figurines indicate that it was used mainly during the Early period. PC7 is the designation given to exploratory excavations carried out on the Plaza Central plat- form mound, the largest mound on the site. The mound was begun in the Early period and en- larged and modified throughout the occupation of the site. A pyramid was built on the west side in Classic times. This designation is given to excavations carried out north of the Plaza Central platform mound. No evidence of structure was found. The outlying site of Huazulco, located south of Chalcatzingo. The outlying site of Telixtac, also located down valley. Appendix II. Eigenvalues for Matrices Plotted in Figures 1-6.
