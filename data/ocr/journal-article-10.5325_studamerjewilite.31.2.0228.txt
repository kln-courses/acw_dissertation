Years ago, teaching <italic>The Waste Land</italic>, I began thinking about the three instructions in “What the Thunder Said” about how to escape the wasteland. What could be more ironic than beginning my Jewish spiritual journey with a noted anti-Semite's central poem? I teach the poem because it is important, but it is a poem in which I have little personal interest. Abstruse allusions to literature in Sanskrit, French, German, Italian, Latin, and ancient Greek—it arouses either self-satisfaction (if I catch any of the allusions) or self-criticism (when I don't). Neither response—“I am smart” or “I am dumb”—is what I seek in literature. So nothing could be more ironic than the truth that it was pondering those three edicts translated as <italic>give</italic>, <italic>sympathize</italic>, and <italic>control</italic> that began my own Jewish search.</p>
      <p>I decided that <italic>give</italic> in the poem means to give yourself to God, <italic>sympathize</italic> means to have sympathy for others, and <italic>control</italic> means to control negative parts of yourself. Then I saw that the three categories themselves—relationship to self, to others, and to God or the sacred—were clarifying and useful. That is: how I relate to myself (Eliot's “control”), how I relate to others (Eliot's “sympathy”), and how I relate to God (Eliot's “give oneself”).</p>
      <p>Beginning with these categories I began to formulate my own key words. My love of Hebrew scripture led me to think about these three areas in Jewish terms. There are, no doubt, many paths to wisdom, but Judaism is my path. Family holidays, temple music, Hebrew school three days a week as a child, my own parents' devotion to their temple—of course, Judaism is my path.</p>
      <p>I think I first encountered the word <italic>Hineni</italic> in Saul Bellow's <italic>Herzog</italic>. When I finally got around to actually reading the Hebrew scriptures years later, the word leaped out to me. How many of our patriarchs (our scriptures are undeniably patriarchal, but that's another story) answer God's question “where are you?” in that contraction of the Hebrew words for <italic>here-I</italic>, meaning “here I am.” I love those stories and read them metaphorically. To me <italic>Hineni</italic> means centeredness, presentness, and the kind of listening Yeats called hearing “in the deep heart's core.” The <italic>shema</italic>, our primary Jewish sentence, is about hearing, so listening to that voiceless voice we say, <italic>Hineni</italic>. Achieving such wisdom—no, working <italic>toward</italic> such wisdom—is my goal for my relationship with myself. So let <italic>Hineni</italic> replace Eliot's self-control. Arguably this is “only” a matter of word choice, since working toward the ability to say <italic>Hineni</italic> no doubt involves controlling other impulses, including flight from self, in noise and motion. Sit still and know that I am God.</p>
      <p>Self and others—Eliot's <italic>sympathize</italic>? Here my watchword comes from our Jewish tradition but in a roundabout way. I was introduced to it by of all things a reference to Edmund Wilson's gravestone. Wilson was not a Jew, but for his tombstone he nevertheless chose <italic>hazak, hazak v'nithazek</italic>—be strong, be strong, and let us strengthen one another. These are the words spoken when the reading of the Torah ends for one year and begins again—invoking the mutual strength to go on. I extract the phrase from its context and use it this way: First I tell myself—be strong, then I tell the other or others to be strong, then together we say, let us strengthen one another. As a woman, I know the word <italic>strong</italic> is usually applied to men and often implies physical power. But I have come to believe that real weakness is internal—and dangerous. Dangerous because out of weakness we fail to do what we know is right and so betray ourselves and others. Arguably, all our sins of omission and commission, from failure to speak out when something needs to be said, to acting out of envy, jealousy, or spite, come from weakness. To nurture others is to help them become stronger. To comfort others is to ease their pain, so that they can regain or develop their strength. Comfort and nurture share the same goal of strengthening. Of course I relate this to Buber's magnificent I/thou relationship with others and maybe ideally with everything that lives. Be strong, oceans of this beautiful planet, be strong. Survive our pollution.</p>
      <p>I have spent much of my life thinking about God. Big deal, who hasn't? I still find it hard to get beyond the anthropomorphism of the old man in the sky with the long beard. But I have more or less given up the useless speculation and come to accept something simple: gratitude. To God or to the life source, I don't know to whom or what. Just gratitude for this spectacular world and for my own personal blessings. And that is our wonderful <italic>sheheheyanu</italic>—once again taken to mean what I believe the words to mean. Gratitude for life itself, gratitude for sustenance, for breath, food, water, all that. Gratitude for bringing me to this moment or time. How wonderful that there are a multiplicity of meanings for <italic>zmon</italic>. To this stage of life—which, in my case, is approaching old age. To the joy of the seasons and weather (the first cool breeze of autumn in San Antonio). To a particular time of day or night and so, potentially, to every moment.</p>
      <p>One evening my husband and I sat on plastic chairs in a field outside a cabin in Leakey, Texas, watching fireflies and repeated sheets of lightning blaze the sky, and I thought like Othello, “If it were now to die, 'twere now to be most happy.” And since Hebrew can put adjectives after the nouns they modify, the Hebrew is “time this.” This. Gratitude for this, just this. Mrs. Ramsay, Virginia Woolf's beloved character, exclaims, “It is enough, it is enough.” <italic>Dayenu</italic>.</p>
      <p>Marge Piercy's great and very Jewish poem “To Be of Use” explains why I have written these ideas. Rereading these words I realize how hopelessly literary my mind is. Not surprising I suppose for an English professor and poet that literature—whether Hebrew scripture or modernist classics—is central to my path. I say <italic>Hineni</italic>, <italic>Hazak</italic>, and <italic>Sheheheyanu</italic>. What do <italic>you</italic> say?</p>
