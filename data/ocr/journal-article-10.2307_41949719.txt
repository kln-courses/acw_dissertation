<plain_text><page sequence="1">Anthropomorphism, Again Vicki Kirby The University of New South Wales, Australia The subject of life is no ordinary object for contemplation. Any ambitious description will inevitably involve awkwardness and paradox because the pure metaphoricity of life's manifest, its morphogenetic exuber- ance, witnesses an ability to embrace the very properties and capacities of whatever it is defined against. As we will see, even when life is apparently snuffed out, finished, exhausted, and done, Deaths uncanny animations at- test to its enduring presence. An interesting implication and extension of this morphing restlessness is that life's identity is inseparable from the subject who inquires about it. In other words, the question of life can shape-shift into the question of the Subject, and in this enlarged scene of identity formation the evolutionary accident that sees consciousness arrive in life's otherwise mindless unfolding feels increasingly problematic. The question that will concern us is this: how is the genesis of human exceptionalism secured if life itself has always been in possession of reflexive techniques that attest to agential and cognitive capacities?

I can reasonably assert, for example, that my questions about life are my own and that I am their author, even if I recognize that their special signature arises in the shared and negotiated muddle of human sociality. Although I might concede that my identity is in many ways reliant upon the surrounding socius and that I can make sense of myself only by negotiat- ing specifically cultural and historical values, I can nevertheless retain the belief that within these webs of influence my individuality remains reason- ably intact. This way of thinking understands a system, in this case "the social," as an ensemble of individuals and collective energies that together constitute a coherent, if changing, frame of reference. However, the belief that the vitality of the system resides in its ability to connect its parts in conversation is inadequate to explain the profound and somewhat mys- terious intimacy that already informs a systems individual 4 parts" with transformative awareness. For the French sociologist Émile Durkheim, the decision to commit suicide provided an exemplary opportunity to consider this phenomenon because the act is so personal that it represents the ultimate expression of individual will. And yet in the unique expression of a nations suicide rate, Durkheim discovered impersonai and predictive patterns of motivation, where such factors as gender, age, a life spent in rural labor or immersed in city pursuits, indeed, even the routine rhythms of the changing seasons- all of these seemingly accidental factors- had more purchase in anticipating and even explaining the act than the justifications offered by the individuals themselves. As Durkheim noted with genuine bafflement: Not merely are there suicides every year, but there are as a general rule as many every year as in the preceding year. Ihe state of mind which causes men to kill themselves is not purely and simply transmitted, but- something much more remarkable- transmitted to an equal number of persons, all in such situations as to make the state of mind become an act. How can this be if only individuals are concerned? Ihe number as such cannot be directly transmitted. Today s population has not learned from yesterday s the size of</page><page sequence="3">Vichi Kirby • 253 the contribution it must make to suicide; nevertheless, it will make one of identical size with that of the past, unless circumstances change. (1970, 308) Durkheim regarded suicide as a symptom of a deeper social malaise, a fragility whose etiology involved the entire social body yet whose legible ef- fects were borne and realized by only certain of its members. In a description that anticipates Louis Althusser's evocation of subject formation through an interpolative act of hailing- "Hey, you there!"- Durkheim ponders this imperative to suicide and why "[o]nly certain ones are called, if this manner of speech is permitted" (1970, 324). According to this reading, the individual is the embodied site of myriad forces and crosscurrents that do not simply sur- round and influence; they actively constitute the internal horizon of a person s ability to thrive, and even to exist. Consequently, if the individual is indeed the living confluence of these energy flows, then we might risk describing an individual s reflections on their own life, and society more generally, as an instantiation of society's reflections on/of itself.1 Paradoxically, it was in the study of death that Durkheim found the living logic of a social system whose collective will to self-harm would manifest locally, individually, as if it were entirely alien and separate from the general community that authored it. Although Dürkheims analysis of life was confined to its human arrange- ments, by comparing the functional workings of sociality to an organism, he inadvertently rehearsed a much larger question about determinism and agency, as well as the special place accorded the individual, in this case of the human species, within Natures expanded socius. To extend what is most counterintuitive in Dürkheims logic would be at least to consider if being human might, in its turn, embody complex and agential forces and cross- currents that are neither exceptional nor simply local, just as the seemingly personal and individual intentions of the suicide were also, at the same time, a compelling manifestation of a dispersed and systemic "will." If we consider that perhaps it is the Subject, life, that hails itself through morphological variation, then Jacques Lacans little essay, "The Mirror Stage as Formative of the Function of the / as Revealed in Psychoanalytic Experi- ence" (1977) becomes the site of an even more involved transitivity than Lacan was prepared to entertain. In its conventional reading, Lacan suggests that</page><page sequence="4">254 • Anthropomorphism, Again the socius individuates itself through observation, for "one's" body can only perceive itself as itself if it is thoroughly othered/peopled- an anticipated projection of the self that must assume the perspective of another. Lacan s intention is to isolate the unique complexity of human subject formation through the process of self-reflection, a specifically conceptual (and there- fore human) process because it is incited and maintained by intellectual curiosity, fantasy, and contradiction. It is this compulsion that inaugurates the subject and projects him into the symbolic or cultural order. And yet Lacan feels compelled to draw upon the life cycle of locusts and pigeons to make the point, for they also "find themselves" in others of their species.2 Strangely, the sense of human exceptionalism endures in Lacan despite his need of such examples, and despite making positive reference to the work of the surrealist sociologist, Roger Caillois. Because it is Caillois, pondering the sociality of life in its wildest and most errant manifestations, who brings psychoanalytic readings to entomology, discovering in insect camouflage evidence of performative experimentation and delight, as well as the de- lirium and paranoia that a "self" or entity of whatever sort must negotiate in order to emerge as a form in/of space. An amateur geologist, Caillois even discovers signs of humanity in the exquisite calligraphy and artistic execution of mineral authors, as the title of his book, The Writing of Stones (1985), suggests. And in Pierres réfléchies (1975), he is again taken by the vitality of stones, their "eventful history" and quiet talent for self-expression. In Caillois's work, life's enduring ability to transform and re-present itself is the very stuff of genesis, and it is ubiqui- tously, relentlessly, and exuberantly present. Given this, what we might con- ventionally understand as the hermeneutic enclosure that discovers homo loquens, a creature forever separated from her natural origins by dint of a unique ability to reinterpret the world, no longer makes sense. For Caillois, the Book of Nature is a living text that rewrites and reinvents itself: it is not a fixed prescription, and nor is it an aggregation of related "individuals." This means that the mineral reproductions that exercise the sociologist's atten- tions as mimetic anthropomorphisms are not misrecognitions of an artistry and intelligence that properly originates in human species being and is then projected and inevitably misconstrued as worldly.</page><page sequence="5">Vichi Kir by • 255 What is provocative in Caillois's musings is this sense of a generalized mimesis without origin, where the self is "called," or "tempted by space." "/ know where I am , but I do not feel as though I'm at the spot where I find myself (1984» 30; emphasis in original). Caillois underlines this sense of a self whose radical dispossession calls the subject forth when he describes the mimic as "similar, not similar to something, but just similar ... he invents spaces of which he is the convulsive possession" (1984, 30). Importantly, this subject is not so much lacking in coherence as Lacan might assume, as if integrity has been forfeited in the process of the subject's appearing. If, for Lacan, the loss that subject formation demands is the painful breach with the maternal, the Real, the materiality of a body bound by the insistent imperatives of its immediate and uncontrolled drives, for Caillois it is not at all clear that the infinite genres of Nature's reproductions, its re-presentations of itself, forfeit anything. In other words, a pure and coherent plenitude does not precede the cut of differentiation for Caillois: life is a plenitude of torsional, reorganizing energies and those energies are never lost. The important difference here is that although Lacan offers a narrative explanation about why the human subject is fraught, fractured, and never unified, he does not extend this in- stability to the actual identity, or event, of human species being itself. On the contrary, Lacan maps a psychic struggle that is internal to being human, a struggle whose unique intellectual and agential dimensions come to define and enclose the human against an inaccessible outside, or nonhuman. For Caillois however, the sense of human exceptionalism and its guar- antees are seriously destabilized if what we understand as the nonhuman is already literate, reinventive, and self-inquiring- if it is in the nature of Nature to mediate and reconfigure itself. Marguerite Yourcenar dilates on this sense of a rampant anthropomorphism, where vegetable, insect, and even mineral life are involved self-reflections, when she notes, "Far from disparaging what is human, as has been alleged, [Caillois] found it all along a scale ranging from molecules to the stars" (in Caillois 1985, xi). In the sociologist's appreciation of a dispersed "human nature," we find "a mine of prodigality, a feast of superfluity; of the element of fantasy, the aesthetic factor whether unconscious or otherwise which is inherent in every scrap of matter and of which man's own aesthetic may be no more than one of many</page><page sequence="6">256 • Anthropomorphism, Again manifestations" (Yourcenar in Caillois 1985, xiii). Caillois himself refused the evolutionary narrative of simple to complex, commenting, "I gradually gave up regarding man as external to nature, its end" (1985, xi).3 Importantly, Caillois argued for anthropomorphism, or what he called an inverted anthropomorphism- an "objective lyricism" where a "diagonal science" could emerge from "forbidden laboratories." But what is this sci- ence whose practice involves such an errant and exuberant truth telling? To entertain this question in a robust way, it helps to remember that the etymology of the word "science" - to know - evokes the sense of dividing, cleaving, discerning, and observing. Given that Caillois's "hidden labora- tories" involve a socius whose animated experiments and self-discoveries even vivify what we conventionally regard as dead and inert matter, then for the purposes of this meditation we might consider that perhaps this whole system is "one" in breach of itself, a "scene of writing" through which inquiry is transubstantiation. It is an interesting exercise to consider why the vital science that Caillois witnesses is not taken more seriously, why its challenges are domesticated and effectively explained away as literary license, a form of imaginative creativity that tells us more about Caillois the man than it does about the nature of Nature. What militates against the notion that reflection can be generalized is surely its logical and fearful consequence, namely, that the will to know has escaped its human container and now appears as a natural imperative. If we allow ourselves to explore the possibility that the Subject who inquires is more generously configured as life itself, a Subject writ large, then the intentional capacities of human curiosity will no longer appear as an end-product in life's evolutionary narrative but as its originary and endur- ing motor. On this last point, namely, what constitutes life, Jacques Derrida encour- ages us not to be complacent in assuming the obviousness of its definition. In "The Animal that Therefore I Am (More to Follow)," he notes: Beyond the edge of the so-called human . . . rather than the "Animal" or "Animal Life," there is already a heterogeneous multiplicity of the living, or more precisely, (since to say the living is already to say too much or not</page><page sequence="7">Vichi Kirby • 257 enough) a multiplicity of organizations of relations between living and dead, relations of organization or lack of organization among realms that are more and more difficult to dissociate by means of the figures of the organic and inorganic, of life and/or death. (2002, 399) By not precluding death or the inorganic from the labor of a system's self- generativity, Derridas open-ended and entangled "scene of writing" might be seen as itself a laboratory, where the work of science takes place as life subjects all aspects of itself to scrutiny. In this laboratory, Caillois's "natural fantastic" might be realized in all of its uncanny, anthropological dimensions. In what follows, I want to offer a preliminary dilation on what it might mean to discover ends in beginnings, an originary anthropomorphism, a "diagonal science": what if the most intriguing riddles that attach to the human condi- tion and its special identity are already present in the presumptive simplicity of life's earliest and most primitive expressions? In Jacques Monod's Chance and Necessity (1971), a classic of its time, we learn that the intricate coherence of the biosphere, the sense that it is ap- propriately understood as a system, requires explanation. The special focus of Monod's inquiry concerns the "profound epistemological contradiction" wherein Nature, an object for study, appears to evolve, or transform itself, with intentional and anticipatory forethought. Monod likens this process to the creative invention of cultural artifacts, where "[t]he object renders in material form the préexistent intention that gave birth to it, and its form is accounted for by the performance expected of it even before it takes shape" (3). What exercises Monoďs interest is the ubiquitous sense of a "conscious and projective, intentional and purposive" (3) activity that we conventionally restrict by attributing it to the specific workings of human culture. As Monod remarks: Every artifact is a product made by a living being which through it expresses, in a particularly conspicuous manner, one of the fundamental characteristics common to all living beings without exception: that of being objects endowed with a purpose or project, which at the same time they exhibit in their struc- ture and carry out through their performances. (1971, 9)</page><page sequence="8">258 • Anthropomorphism, Again Monod argues that the making of artifacts is exemplary of &amp; general purpose, a natural purpose, whose creative invention has no simple origin, author, or special location: this general engineering project is evident throughout the system, articulating its every expression. Consequently, the elusive difference between "natural" and "artificial," even living and nonliving, is completely undone in Monoďs concession that on the basis of structural criteria, macroscopic ones, it is probably impos- sible to arrive at a definition of the artificial which, while including all "veritable" artifacts, such as the products of human workmanship, would exclude objects so clearly natural as crystalline structures, and indeed, the living beings themselves which we would also like to classify among natural systems. (1971, 7) According to this logic, even within an organism, its internal differentiations, the development of different organs and their integrated capacities, could be regarded as "nested" technicities that witness previous transformations whose different functions were already anticipated and engineered accord- ingly.4 In other words, the very notion of artifact, supplement, or even what designates an individual life form as a detached precedent to a later develop- ment, goes awry if the individual is, through and through, a crosshatching of temporal and spatial breachings- a pure supplementarity. However, if Monod's teleonomy seems to conjure a sense of life as the always/already of an involved and entangled intercourse, where specific in- dividuations such as species distinctions are always contingent, provisional, and necessarily compromised, then in the corollary structures of "autono- mous morphogenesis" and "self-replication" he will rediscover and enforce the coherence and integrity of individual identity. ... a living being s structure . . . owes almost nothing to the action of outside forces, but everything, from its overall shape down to its tiniest detail, to "morphogenetic" interactions within the object itself. It is thus a structure giving proof of an autonomous determinism: precise, rigorous, implying a virtually total "freedom" with respect to outside agents or conditions- which</page><page sequence="9">Vichi Kir by • 259 are capable, to be sure, of impeding this development, but not of governing or guiding it, not of prescribing its organizational scheme to the living object. (Monod 1971, 10-11) Faithful to an analytical logic that understands identity in terms of autono- mous and independent units, Monod explains the regularity of a unique and purposeful code in terms of the integrity of an organism's interiority, its self-identity: it must reproduce and preserve itself in isolation from an en- vironment of potentially hostile forces. Whereas the evidence of teleonomy appeared throughout the fabric of life- and strangely, Monod will continue to perceive and acknowledge evidence of its generality- he now insists that the motor of its production is actually a local program that works because it is contained. Given this circumscription, the difference between the in- ternal workings of the organism and its external environment represents an abyssal limit. In Monod's conception of how biological entities endure and thrive, we witness an incipient political theory. As noted above, the molecular biologist begins his analysis with pregiven biological entities, individuals who enjoy "virtually total 'freedom' with respect to outside agents or conditions." In such a scenario, where power is the equivalent of disruption and prohibition, it makes sense that power will manifest outside and against the organism, as something brutal and unrecognizable; a threat to an integrity that remains intact prior to its violation. Although this force is "capable, to be sure, of impeding . . . development," of blocking and stalling, it is sufficiently alien to the organism's own motivation and self-knowledge that it is incapable of "governing or guiding [the organism], nor of prescribing its organizational scheme." According to Monod, the original text that is the organism, its very ontology, is already a prescription, and inasmuch as its logic is a program of invariance, unfamiliar forces are incapable of rewriting it. As Monod's explication is convoluted and arguably contradictory in its detail, it is easy to lose one's bearings. We are asked to concede a sense of teleonomy that attributes all of life, its systemic unity, with what we conven- tionally regard as human motivation and intention, a sense of anticipation that could in all fairness be likened to forethought. And yet life remains</page><page sequence="10">260 • Anthropomorphism, Again sufficiently fragile that it is permanently vulnerable to a force of rupture and random accident that by definition, thwarts any sense of determination or system, and not surprisingly, is not itself life. For Monod, an original and in- variant "design plan ' falls prey to the forces of chance, and as a result, Monod has no other recourse than to conclude that we live in an indifferent universe. [I]t necessarily follows that chance alone is at the source of every innova- tion, of all creation in the biosphere. Pure chance, absolutely free but blind, at the very root of the stupendous edifice of evolution: this central concept of modern biology is no longer one among other possible or even conceivable hy- potheses. It is today the sole conceivable hypothesis, the only one that squares with observed and tested fact. And nothing warrants the supposition - or the hope - that on this score our position is likely ever to be revised. (1971, 112-13) How to reconcile, or understand, the structure of Monoďs argument when its different analytical terms mutate into their opposites? The sense of purpose, for example, the structural teleonomy that Monod witnesses throughout the biosphere provides the ecological glue that allows a systems "parts" to anticipate their workability- the general "fit" of their transforma- tions. But having conceded this sense of an intimate intricacy from which nothing can be truly alien, it remains unclear why Monod will attribute the systems enduring viability to happenstance. On this latter point, when the object of our discussion is the relational implication that the word "system" connotes, what leverage can the notion of pure chance presume? It is clear that Monod struggles to manage the emerging inconsistency in his argu- ment by apportioning functionality and cohesion to only certain parts of the system. However, by his own logic, Monod's departure point is an organism whose very ontology and viability, its familiar and predictable repetitions and adhesions (necessities), are the living embodiment of what in his terms are previous chance encounters. In other words, the history of life, or what is purportedly prior to its encounter with non-life, is itself the story of non-life's encounter with itself. Although Monod admits there are significant omissions in his book and that "[s]ome outstanding chapters in biology are not even mentioned," he</page><page sequence="11">Vichi Kirby • 261 regards these oversights as largely irrelevant because he aims to unpack something more general and overarching, namely, "the quintessence of the molecular theory of the code" (1971, xix). And here we strike at the heart of the matter and its relevance for those of us who do not hail from the sci- ences yet who share Monod's interest in the possibility of an informational approach to biology. How to think the 'overarching" assumption that life, in its myriad manifestations, is information? Indeed, and more pressingly, what is information that it can explain the manifest heterogeneity of life, including human specificity? Or, to put this another way, if the explanatory purchase of biological arguments is all inclusive rather than reductionist- if a pre- scriptive rigidity does not precede the creative plasticity of what is unique to human culture, agential invention, and individual intention- then what special status can Monod concede to being human? For Monod certainly as- sumes that human being is the exception: "The ancient covenant is in pieces; man knows at last that he is alone in the universe's unfeeling immensity, out of which he emerged only by chance. His destiny is nowhere spelled out, nor is his duty. The kingdom above or the darkness below: it is for him to choose" (1971, 180). As I read Monod, his explanation of life and its particular manifestation in human being is as confusing and contradictory as it is provocative and illuminating. Trying to accommodate its detail remains a salutary exercise, especially for those of us who remain fascinated by the enduring challenge of the linguistic turn in its deconstructive configuration, a turn whose troping energy cannot be confined to linguistics and whose resonant complexities Derrida has described as originary, indeed, as life itself (1975). Returning to Durkheim as a way to reconsider Monod, it is important to appreciate that the sociologist's sense of wonder at the functional adhesions and disloca- tions in the social organism were inspired by the fact that a communication model was incapable of explaining a society's individual effects. Put simply, information could not be a separate "something" transferred between dif- ferent individuals because, to use a deconstructive notion, these individuals were always/already in receipt of it. This sense of the always /already, which undercuts a notion of identity and implies an enfolded enduring, or "living on," is the conundrum we confront here.</page><page sequence="12">262 • Anthropomorphism, Again For Monod, his understanding of what constitutes a system, its neces- sity, is confined to the program, the set of informational instructions whose repetition can only result in an invariant and therefore perfect copy. Need- less to say, Monod's notion of information cannot accommodate any sense of internal experimentation and errant rupture, for this would imbue the letter of life with an incipient purpose that includes play, something Monod attributes to human cognition alone. The implications here are actually more interesting, as any sense of systemic "play" will find that cognitive purpose and directed intention is never at one with itself: it cannot originate in, and nor can it belong to, an individual. Pursuant to this, and as noted above, what changes the code is not itself code according to Monod, nor is it life, even though the chance violations of life's instructions represent transfor- mative possibilities that life is somehow equipped to recognize, reinscribe, and incorporate. Precisely how the results of this surprise assault are made legible and productive is not explained, and as a consequence, Monod finds himself in a tangle that can only be managed with the introduction of a deus ex machina- quantum mechanics. John A. Miles Jr., whose reading of Chance and Necessity underlines the books unacknowledged and unresolved religious intent, argues that at base, it is Monoďs wonder at the miraculous behavior of physis that holds his fascination: "Monod, of course, never speaks of matter qua philosophical category. However, as he conducts the reader through the dazzling intrica- cies of biochemistry, matter is so constantly in the background that . . . one senses that it is the incredibility of matter itself to which he refers" (1974» 35)- It seems that the writerly precision of life- the "blind fidelity" of its tran- scriptions, translations, replications - guarantee life's maintenance despite the inevitable "quantum perturbations, whose accumulation within a mac- roscopic system will slowly but surely alter its structure" (Monod 1971, 112, 111). But must we adopt the predictably routine assumption, the foundation of metaphysics, that matter has a separate and entirely different structural ontology than information? Ironically, if we consult the work of Karen Barad, a particle physicist, we see an emphasis on Niels Bohr's refusal to separate ideation from material behavior: Bohr actually questions their ontologica! difference. In Meeting the</page><page sequence="13">Vichi Kir by • 263 Universe Halfway : Quantum Physics and the Entanglement of Matter and Mean- ing (2007), Barad reminds us: "According to Bohr, our ability to understand the physical world hinges on our recognizing that our knowledge-making practices, including the use and testing of scientific concepts, are material enactments that contribute to, and are a part of, the phenomena we describe" (32). It is the intimacy of this entanglement, or what Barad calls an 4 agential realist framework," that provokes "a lively new ontology . . . that reworks the nature of both relationality and aliveness (vitality, dynamism, agency)" (33). Crucial to this particular meditation about life's capacity for self-inquiry, its anthropomorphic resonance, is Barad's neologism "intra-action," which signifies the mutual constitution of entangled agencies. That is, in contrast to the usual "interaction," which assumes that there are separate individual agencies that precede their interaction, the notion of intra-action recognizes that distinct agencies do not precede, but rather emerge through, their intra- action . . . [Ajgencies are only distinct in relation to their mutual entanglement; they don't exist as individual elements. (2007, 33; emphasis in original) However, it would be misguided to read this reference to the physical sci- ences as remedial, as if what counts as concrete and objective can somehow trump and repair the sort of ephemeral musings that hail from the humani- ties - ephemeral because they are representational, abstract, ideational. I have argued elsewhere that the Saussurean sign- the atom of any lan- guage system and the operational ingredient of culture- is itself a quantum problematic. Its aggregation into separate parts that remain "consubstantial," where "separate" also implies "inseparable," is a conundrum about the nature of systematicity and not an explanation (Kirby 1997). Indeed, even Saussure concedes that the material part of the sign, the sense impression, is wrongly described because it is of the same order as the concept. The attribution of location to a sign, a precise sense of its "hereness" and "nowness" in a system, is also impossible as the system that appears external to it actually imbues it with functional life. If the quantum muddle of nonlocality certainly stalks these definitions, in Saussure's struggle to maintain any working sense of the term "arbitrary" (Monod's "chance") we find evidence of the difficulty of</page><page sequence="14">264 • Anthropomorphism, Again circumscribing (locating) a system in terms of something that is purportedly alien to that system. Saussure was eventually defeated in his aim to define the proper object of linguistics, as his gesture toward a general semiology acknowledges and his obsession with the mad errancy of anagrams and glos- solalia further attests. If we grant that Derridas work unpacks some of the more complex in- volvements in Saussure's work, moving from semiology to grammatology, we can still assume that these readings have little if anything to do with quan- tum mechanics because, as Derrida insists, "there is no outside metaphysics," "no outside of text." This reading is certainly conventional in deconstructive circles - the sense that substance or matter is radically alien to language/ form, and therefore not inherent to what gives that system its self-referential identity. However, it is also conventional within a deconstructive reading to worry about how an inside secures the homogeneity of its identity against an outside that it is purportedly alien, unknown and unknowable. Karen Barad argues forcefully that the most provocative implication that follows from quantum mechanics is that models of interpretation and measurement do not interfere and transform phenomena that preexist their measurement. Consequently, what we perceive as the results of interpretation are not so much mediating and mediated constructs, but aspects of an entangled ob- jectivity that is not lacking in the intention ... to measure, or know itself. Given this, Derridas "no outside metaphysics" need not be read as the enclosure of ideation against a more solid and primordial substrate. If it is in the nature of physis to engage in a torsional exercise of reconceiving itself, then this scene of rewriting is strangely reminiscent of Caillois s wild science, a global anthropomorphism that offers itself up to its own self-reflection and scrutiny. Importantly however, the human isn't simply dispersed in this in- tricate involvement, as we might assume from Caillois s musings. Nor is this Bruno Latours "distributed agency," where the motor of intention is shared among a "parliament," or aggregation of things, measuring instruments, other creatures - the dispositif of a worldly laboratory (Latour, 1993). The challenge in the Derridean text (which can build on these other readings) is that it refuses to read difference in terms of an aggregation of identities that inter- act and communicate. A direct consequence of différance, or intra-action, is</page><page sequence="15">Vichi Kir by • 265 that the identity of humanity and its purported qualities- intention, agency, consciousness, subjectivity, language- are now very much in question. To catch at the puzzle and challenge in this different way of thinking about life, we can take Derrida as our guide. In his discussion of the work of François Jacob, winner of the Nobel Prize for RNA transcription (together with Jacques Monod and Andre Lwoff), Derrida notes something unusual. The biologist gets himself into the same tangle as his colleague, Monod, when he attempts to discriminate between the textual operations of the genetic code and the complex intelligence of the cultural order (the cere- bral- institutional), the sense of programmatic necessity versus the play of chance. Only through an act of faith, the presumption that human cognition and willful intention are circumscribed - a property of human consciousness that requires no justification- can Jacob proceed. However, Derrida remains unsatisfied with this division between Nature and Culture, nonhuman and human, and lays down a challenge that casts life as the writer/reader: that which we, men, claim to accept in culture as model, that is to say dis- cursive texts or calculators and all that we believe to understand familiarly under the name of text, that which we pretend then to accept as model, comparison, analogy with the view of understanding the basic living entity; this itself is a complex product of life, of the living, and the claimed model is exterior neither to the knowing subject nor to the known object The text is not a third term in the relation between the biologist and the living, it is the very structure of the living as shared structure of the biologist- as living- of science as a production of life, and the living itself. (1975, Seminar 4, 5) To close, it should be clear that for this reader, Derridas work is not a project whose relevance is fast fading in the dusk of its inevitable failure (Malabou 2007; 2010). Catherine Malabou, for example, notes, "The 'failure of grammatology was programmed by grammatology itself. . . . The Derridean redefinition of writing constitutes the foundations of grammatology while contradicting the very concept of science" (2007, 432). And again, "as one knows, Of Grammatology establishes the limits of the classical épistemè and at the same time the closure of knowledge. In this sense there cannot truly</page><page sequence="16">266 • Anthropomorphism, Again be a science of writing'* (2007, 433). If textuality is life, reproducibility, genesis, then there is no need to elide the writing lesson with the accomplishments of human species being, as if knowledge is a closed system that can never truly access its elusive referent. To reread the implications of a general writ- ing, even in ways that Derrida may not have envisioned, is not to depart from Derrida but to revivify his work where others perceive an exhausted methodology. To open the question of both science and writing, as Derrida encour- ages us to do, means that the title of Malabou's recent book, What Should We Do with Our Brain? (2008), an acknowledgment of the insights into brain plasticity coming from neurology, would come under considerable pressure in regard to the narrowness of its terms. The conflation of the "we" with a conventional notion of human species being, with the cerebral, with the mind, cannot be justified in Derridas reading of life, nor will it hold in terms of current biological insights into the intelligence of cellular life, as we see in the blurring of the nature-culture distinction in recent research into epigen- esis (Jabloňka and Lamb 2005; Stotz 2008). What risk is taken if we begin to acknowledge Caillois s hidden laboratories, where Natures musings have no clear origin or outcome, and no one is an author? NOTES 1. It would be interesting to dilate on this point using aspects of Georges Canguilhem's work that enact a style of "short cut" between representations or concepts of life and the facts of life themselves: "The thought of the living must take from the living the idea of the living" (2008, xx). The editors of Canguilhem's Knowledge of Life (originally La connaissance de la vie, 1952) underline the importance of his counterintuitive sense of reflection in the book's Forward, "Life, as Such." They note, "Knowledge, as the capacity to solve problems, may and indeed does vary in different animals, but it is produced by life. Hence the double meaning of the title: 'knowledge of life' is simultaneously and inseparably the knowledge we have of life when we take it as an object, and the knowl- edge that life itself produces" (Marrati and Meyers, in Canguilhem 2008, ix). 2. By taking Lacan at his word, Jacques Derrida shows how claims about human excep- tionalism are often anchored in an ambiguity that supports a very different conclusion. For an extended discussion of the possibility that the animal, indeed, even the machine,</page><page sequence="17">Vichi Kirby • 267 shares the liveliness of human speculation, see "And Say the Animal Responded?" (2003). 3. Regarding the assumption that the human is necessarily a very late arrival in a story of incremental complexity, I refer the reader to Derridas dilation on evolution as "writing." See his response to Jean Hyppolite in the "Discussion" following "Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourses of the Human Sciences" (Derrida 1978). Here, Derrida refuses the suggestion that if evolution is a form of writing, then humankind appears as an aberration in these scribblings, an aberration because the complexity of intention and calculation belong to the authorship of humanity alone and could not precede its ar- rival. 4. One thinks of the pathfinding work of biologist Lynn Margulis, who understands life in terms of a profound interdependency. Margulis argues that through processes such as endosymbiosis, life's cooperative communities and networks can even ingest or become each other, as in the example of mitochondria. See, for example, Symbiotic Planet: A New Look at Evolution (1999) and Microcosmos: Four Billion Years of Evolution (1997). REFERENCES Barad, Karen. 2007.
