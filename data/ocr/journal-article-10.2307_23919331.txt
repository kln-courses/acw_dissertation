Dave Vliegenthart1 Master Student, Religious Studies, Department of Religious Studies, University of Amsterdam, Oude Turfmarkt 145, 1012 GC Amsterdam, the Netherlands E-mail: davevliegenthart@live.nl Received: 23 October 2010; revised: 1 April 2011; accepted: 11 April 2011 Summary Neurotheology is a fast-growing field of research. Combining philosophy of mind, neuroscience, and religious studies, it takes a new approach to old questions on religion. What is religion and why do we have it? Neurotheologists focus on the search for the neural correlate of religious experiences. If we can trace religious experiences to specific parts of the brain, chances are we can reduce religion as such to that grey soggy matter as well. This article predicts neurotheology will not be able to locate the neural correlate of religious experiences. As we cannot decide phenom enally what makes an experience religious, neurologically we cannot find its correlate either. That is, if there are fixed neural correlates to begin with, because their existence is still a matter of debate. In addition, religious experiences seem to be a kind of experience, like emotional or relational experiences, making them indistinguishable from similar nonreligious experiences. Even if one manages to trace the neural correlate of religious experiences, neurotheology will still not be able to account for the rise of religion without resorting to theories from other disciplines. In the end, we do not know enough about consciousness and the way it relates to the brain to make conclusive claims about the search for religious states of consciousness. It seems, however, that even though neurotheology could provide fascinating insights in the workings of the reli gious brain, on its own, it will prove unable to explain religion fully. Keywords neurotheology, consciousness, neural correlates of consciousness, religion, religious experience Were God to play hide and seek, should we look for "Him" in the brain? The majority of scientists and philosophers in the up-and-coming field of neu rotheology believe so.

Vliegenthart / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 33 (2011) 137-171 forces and started tinkering with brain imaging, several decades ago, there have been astonishing feats of technical ingenuity, allowing us to probe the brain with increasing precision. These (relatively) non-evasive methods2 have carried the field of neuroscience a giant leap forward. After a remarkable run of physiological discoveries that provided answers to questions long thought insoluble, many are now starting to believe neuroscience might just be able to solve the body-mind problem. The body-mind problem has haunted humanity for millennia. "We are the inheritors of ancient debates," says Velmans (2009, p. 3), referring to debates on whether the universe consists of one thing (monism) or two things (dualism). Those who argue for monism reduce mind to matter (naturalism or material ism) or matter to mind (idealism), but are left with the stubborn question on how there can be only one thing when it seems there are two. Those who argue for dualism retain the apparent distinction, but have to answer the just as persistent question on how thought can influence substance and substance thought. These days, the discussion has converged around consciousness. "Consciousness" is perhaps not exactly the same as "mind," because the mind also contains unconscious states and processes, but it does seem to be that part of the mind that is most closely connected to the brain (Velmans, 2009, p. 4). Crick and Koch (2000, p. 103) point out to us, "it is not com pletely obvious how the activity of the brain produces our sensory experiences and, more generally, how it produces consciousness." This statement implies, though, that apparently it is obvious to look in the brain, if we want to trace the source of consciousness. It seems that most neuroscientists are monists, who reduce mind, rather consciousness, to matter. Recently, neuroscience has found its way to religion. Although more and more scholars are discovering the fascinating hybrid of neurotheology, pio neers like Michael Persinger, Eugene D'Aquili, and Andrew Newberg were among the first to submit far-reaching conclusions about religious experiences and religion in general, based on neurotheological research, that is, neurosci entific experiments where either the researchers or their subjects used religious terminology in their descriptions of the experiments. Simply put, they claim •" Modem scanners enable us to locate which areas of the brain are active during the perfor mance of a certain task, either by measuring the oxygen or glucose supply to various parts of the brain or by recording the electric or magnetic fields produced by different parts of the brain. Electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are entirely noninvasive. Both positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) use radioactive tracers in the blood to assess oxygen and glucose consumption.</page><page sequence="3">D. Vliegenthart/Archive for the Psychology of Religion 33 (2011) 137-171 139 that religion can be explained by relating or even reducing religious experi ences to the brain. These claims, to which I will return later, have recently been challenged, for different reasons, by scholars from different fields, such as neuroscientist Nina Azari and philosopher of religion John Hick. Azari joins Persinger, D'Aquili, and Newberg in their materialist stance but takes issue with their neurological explanations for religious experiences. She also ques tions whether neurological explanations in general can sufficiently explain why we have religion at all. Hick, coming from an entirely different back ground, is troubled by the materialist stance as such. Although he plays a part in this paper, his rebuttal to neurotheology will be given slightly less attention than that of Azari. In the following pages, I leap into the fast-growing field of neurotheology, trying to see if neurotheology can explain religion—what it is and why we have it. I restrict "religion" to religious states of consciousness, or simply reli gious experiences, because this is where religion and neuroscience come together in neurotheology. Religion can only be studied by neuroscience by connecting subjective religious experiences to objective neurological activity in the brain. What I mean by religious experiences will become clear in the course of this paper. I want to find out whether or not religious experiences are nothing but a neural correlate of consciousness and if so whether religion can then be traced to the brain as well. However, the way they stand, these ques tions abound in hidden and not so hidden assumptions about God, religion, religious experiences, the brain, the mind, consciousness, and the way these relate to each other. I will need to address these issues first, before I can come up with any answers. 1 intend to build up my assessment of neurotheology from the ground. I realize, though, that it is limited and incomplete, due to the limitations of space. In the first part of this paper, I survey some of the current philosophical theories of mind, without pretending to be exhaustive, in search of a working hypothesis for "consciousness." In the second part of this paper, I do the same for "religious experience." Here, however, I restrict my review to a single sem inal theory, that of Friedrich Schleiermacher, whom 1 discuss based on the critical rendering that philosopher of religion Wayne Proudfoot (1985) pro vides in his Religious Experience. I have chosen this particular theologian for two reasons. The first reason is that his philosophy arguably can be seen as an archetypical modern approach to religion. Schleiermacher reduced religion to an experience, a "feeling" or an "intuition," as he called it. And, as I explained above, since religion and neuroscience can only converge on religious experi ences, Schleiermacher seems an obvious source to turn to when trying to</page><page sequence="4">140 D. Vliegenthart / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 33 (2011) 137-171 define what a religious experience is, which is the second reason why I chose him. In the third part of this paper, I bring these topics together, looking at religion and religious states of consciousness from a neurological perspective, as presented in the writings of Persinger, D'Aquili and Newberg and criticized by Azari and Hick. I have chosen Persinger, D'Aquili and Newberg for my discussion of neurotheology, because they have had a decisive impact on the creation and formation of this budding field. I have restricted my criticism of these researchers and their claims about what neurotheology can do to Azari and Hick, because they voice typical responses from both sides of the neu rotheological coin: neuroscience, on the one hand, and religious studies and theology, on the other. This paper contributes to the discussion by expanding on some of the issues that Azari and Hick, in my opinion, do not fully develop or leave untouched. Consciousness Nothing is closer to us than consciousness. It is the first thing we encounter in the morning and the last thing to leave us at night (e.g., Edelman &amp; Tononi, 2000b, p. 3; Searle 2007, p. 326). Precisely because it is so near to us, it eludes us. For what can be more difficult to understand than that which makes understanding possible? What can be harder to perceive than that which per mits perception? Consciousness is the light that makes everything visible, while remaining invisible itself. Nevertheless, I will have to come up with a definition for consciousness before I can embark on a discussion about reli gious states of consciousness. The purpose of this first part of the paper, there fore, is to define "consciousness." A common marker for consciousness is subjectivity or what Nagel (1981) has so memorably called a what it is like to be something. In his renowned What Is It Like to Be a Bat? Nagel submits that for conscious creatures there must be a subjective feel to their existence. Chalmers (1997; 2007, p. 226) has recast what it is like into "experience." Being conscious simply means having experience. The question that occupies us here is what "having experience" as such really means. In recent years, more and more researchers disclosed their interest in con sciousness, slowly dragging it out of neglect. Once considered a taboo in the academic community, "consciousness" has developed into one of the most promising domains of research. Neuroscientists have taken the (t)issue head on and are now in pursuit of so-called neural correlates of consciousness. Simply</page><page sequence="5">D. Vliegenthart / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 33 (2011) 137-171 141 put, a neural correlate of consciousness, NCC for short, is a specific brain state that is directly associated with a specific phenomenal experience. For instance, if I see something red, the experience of redness, its "qualiaf if you will, cor responds directly to a certain part in the visual system of my brain. The assumption behind it is, of course, in the words of McGinn (1989, p. 349), that Technicolor phenomenology arises from soggy grey matter and that the water of the physical brain is turned into the wine of consciousness. Most will stick to a correlation of some kind, though some, like Searle (2007, p. 328), flat out assert a causation. There is an acute difference, however, that we need to be clear about. McNamara (2009, pp. 11-13) provides a clarifying example. In short, let us say we have several clinical cases showing that trauma to brain region Y is attended by a decrease in religiousness. Here, we could speak of a correlation. We find that the patients who use drug X, which stimulates brain region Y, had intense religious experiences prior to the injury, which they lost after wards. This tentatively tips the balance towards causation. However, it is still too soon to claim that brain region Y, or drug X, produces religious experi ences. Next, we learn that brain region Y contains neuron Z, only found in that region, and that the degree of religiousness relates to the amount of Z neurons. Now, perhaps, we can talk about causation. Yet I would still follow McNamara in saying that brain region Y, or neuron Z, is required for religious experiences, keeping causation open. Returning to NCCs, Chalmers (2000, p. 17) thinks the search for neural correlates of consciousness is the cornerstone of the recent resurgence of the search for consciousness. He breaks up the NCCs into three types. The first looks for the correlate of consciousness as such, being conscious as opposed to not being conscious, the second for the correlate of specific background con sciousness, such as being awake, asleep, hypnotized, and so on, the third for the correlate of phenomenal content of consciousness. Most research has gone into the third type, drawing heavily from experi ments with patients who have suffered severe brain injury.3 This has lead to new insights into the workings of the different parts of the brain and their relation to mental and physical behaviour. We are learning more and more about the neural correlates of subjectivity. The complicated findings fall out side the scope of this paper. The theoretical frames built around them, how ever, do not. I will not go over every theory out there in minute detail, but I 3) A particularly well-known example are of course the clinical cases recounted by Sacks ( 1970/1998) in The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat,</page><page sequence="6">142 D. Vliegenthart/Archive for the Psychology of Religion 33 (2011) 137-171 will pick out some prevalent thoughts from the field of philosophy of mind, as a backdrop for the neurotheological discussion that follows later. Theories on Consciousness Mysterianism I think Harris (2005, p. 208) is right when he points out that "the idea that brains produce consciousness is little more than an article of faith among sci entists at present." Although I would be a bit more reluctant to add, that "there are many reasons to believe that the methods of science will be insuffi cient to either prove or disprove it." I do not and cannot know if science, a decade, century, millennium from now, will be able to solve the issue. Neither can Harris, yet he seems convinced science will not: "The fact that the universe is illuminated where you stand, the fact that your thoughts and moods and sensations have a qualitative character, is an absolute mystery—rivalled only by the mystery, famously articulated by the philosopher Schelling, that there should be anything at all in this universe rather than nothing" (Harris, 2005, p. 209). The view Harris seems to defend is a controversial position in the cognitive sciences, that of anticonstructive naturalism, also referred to as mysterianism, "a term coined by Owen Flanagan (1992) for a view devised, developed, and largely associated with McGinn" (Rowlands, 2007, p. 335). In his description of mysterianism, Flanagan distinguishes between an old and a new version. The old version is dualistic; body and mind or brain and consciousness stand apart. Faced with the evidence from neuroscience, the new version has shifted towards a naturalistic position but without giving up an element of mystery. It claims, "There are in fact properties of the brain that account naturalistically for consciousness. But we cannot grasp these proper ties or explain how consciousness depends on them... It is terminally mysteri ous not because it is a nonnatural phenomenon, not because it is a miracle, but because an understanding of its nature is cognitively closed' to us" (Flana gan, 1992, p. 2). In his Can We Solve the Mind-Body Problem) McGinn intro duced his position. In a nutshell, McGinn (1989, p. 353) propounds, Resolutely shunning the supernatural, I think it is undeniable that it must be in virtue of some natural property of the brain that organisms are conscious... Brain states cause conscious states, we know, and this causal nexus must proceed through necessary connections of some kind, the kind that would make the nexus intelligible if they were understood.</page><page sequence="7">D. Vliegenthart /Archive for the Psychology of Religion 33 (2011) 137-171 143 These necessary connections are not understood, for we are "cognitively closed" to the concepts needed to fathom them (McGinn, 1989, p. 350). And trying to grasp them by using the physical concepts of the brain to explain conscious ness or the phenomenal concepts of consciousness to explain the brain is not permitted. According to McGinn (1989, p. 358), that would be violating the homogeneity constraint. Seeing as we cannot derive consciousness from brain properties, because inferences of purely physical data will never take us out of the physical realm, consciousness is kept forever at bay. Let us look at the arguments, step by step. The first part is not an argument at all, but, as Harris pointed out, an article of faith. To assume the brain causes consciousness is a belief. There is a correlation, no doubt, but we have already seen that correlation is not the same as causation. Taken literally, the second part is tautological. "Nexus" means "core" or "connection," and "intelligible" stands for "capable of being understood." So what McGinn is really saying is that "the (core of the) connection between brain states and conscious states proceeds through other connections of some kind that would make this (core) connection understandable if only it were understood." Harsh as it may sound, arguing that we do not understand a connection, because we do not understand it, strikes me as an empty phrase. In his defence of cognitive closure, McGinn (1989, p. 352) looks to John Locke. Locke believed a science of matter was beyond us, because our ideas of matter are constrained by our perceptions. Reality is not inherently mysteri ous, he said, rather the mystery comes from our cognitive limitations. Locke was mistaken about matter, admits McGinn, but what we can take away from him is the realization that we might not be able to solve every problem that confronts us. "Only a misplaced idealism about the natural world could war rant the dogmatic claim that everything is knowable by the human species at this stage of its evolutionary development," warns McGinn (1989, p. 353). Of course, this works just as well the other way around. What about a misplaced mysterianism warranting the dogmatic claim that everything is not knowable by the human species? If anything, Locke taught us it is premature to make statements about what science can and cannot do, before all the facts are in. We are still discovering new things about the relation between brain and con sciousness, every day. Even if we are like five-year olds trying to wrap their minds around Relativity Theory (McGinn, 1989, pp. 353-354), five-year olds grow up. Someday they can step aboard Einstein's train of thought and even move beyond it into the fabulous world of quanta and strings, a world they did not even know existed when they were only five years old.</page><page sequence="8">144 D. Vliegenthart / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 33 (2011) 137-171 Finally, I agree with Flanagan about the homogeneity constraint being too restrictive and thus untenable. The homogeneity constraint is what causes our cognitive closure. The methodological restriction of preventing us to move from the subjective to the objective or the other way around inevitably gets us stuck in an epistemic trap. If we do not allow ourselves to say anything about the brain, when talking about consciousness, we have created the very mystery between body and mind we are trying to solve. Biological Naturalism Searle (2008, p. 152) thinks there is no philosophical mystery to the body mind problem at all. It has an obvious solution: "all of our mental phenomena are caused by lower-level neuronal processes in the brain and are themselves realized in the brain as higher-level, or system, features." "And," he adds else where (Blackmore, 2005, p. 200), "the word there that counts is cause'. The brain is a biological organ ... and it functions to cause conscious states." Searle (2007, p. 330) considers consciousness "a higher-level feature of brain sys tems." Think of it as liquidity, Manson (2003, p. 145) suggests; water is liquid, even though none of the water molecules themselves are.4 Can we say, then, Searle's biological naturalism reduces consciousness to the brain? It all depends on what we mean by "reduction." Searle (2008, p. 155) thinks there is an acute difference between causal and ontological reducibility. Causally, consciousness can be traced to the neuronal workings of the brain. Ontologically, however, it cannot. "You cannot show that a first-person ontol ogy is nothing but a third-person ontology" (Searle, 2007, p. 328). It is not ontologically reducible, Manson (2003, p. 146) elaborates, because "there is no gap between appearance and reality for the reductionist to trade upon." Content of consciousness can appear different from what it is, but when it comes to consciousness itself, the appearance always is its reality. Therefore, nothing can be more fundamental than our first-person experience of con sciousness. As Searle (2008, p. 156) puts it, "The sense in which, though caus 41 Searle (e.g., 2007, p. 328) himself often employs the analogy of a car engine. We can describe lifting our arm, he explains, both at the level of conscious intention and its corresponding bodily movement and at the level of neurons and synapses, just as we can describe the operation of a car engine both at the level of pistons, cylinders, and spark plugs and at the molecular level of metal alloys. I find this analogy wanting, though, because in lifting my arm, deliberate movement is involved, which is not the case with the car engine, unless we include the driver. Deliberation alludes to free will, and free will cannot be as easily reduced to matter the way internal combus tion can. Incidentally, Searle (Blackmore, 2005, pp. 205-206) believes in free will and a self as its corollary, but does not rule out that the brain may create the illusion of freedom.</page><page sequence="9">D. Vliegenthart / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 33 (2011) 137-171 145 ally reducible, it is ontologically irreducible, is that a complete description of the third-person objective features of the brain would not be a description of its first-person subjective features." Searle (2008) is quick to point out, though, that his biological naturalism should not be mistaken for property dualism. Property dualism and biological naturalism agree on consciousness being ontologically irreducible, though causally related to the brain. They part ways, or so Searle (2008, p. 154) thinks, when property dualists start saying that mental states are something distinct from and over and above neurobiological states. My quarrel with biological naturalism is that its solution is too simple and uncritical. Where McGinn is too quick to surrender in our struggle with con sciousness, I think, Searle rushes to an unwarranted victory. In taking "correla tion" for "causation" he sweeps the real issues under the carpet. The brain causes consciousness, period. How or why it does so is left unanswered. Dynamic Core Hypothesis How the brain might cause consciousness is answered by Edelman and Tononi (2000b) and their Darwinian dynamic core hypothesis. Edelman and Tononi (e.g., 2000a, p. 141 ; 2000b, p. xii) assert that "consciousness arises as a par ticular kind of brain process that is both highly unified (or integrated) and highly complex (or differentiated)." Integration, on the one hand, means that the brain contains interacting neural processes, which have internal cohesion and external isolation. Together these make up so-called functional clusters. They are called clusters, because their elements interact more strongly among themselves than with the rest of the system (Edelman &amp; Tononi, 2000a, p. 145). Differentiation, on the other hand, means the brain is able to dis criminate between a large number of options. "What makes a conscious state informative is not how many chunks' of information it appears to contain, but rather that its occurrence discriminates between billions of different states of affairs, each of which might lead to different behavioural outputs" (Edel man &amp; Tononi, 2000b, p. 29). In lay terms, this means consciousness is an integrated core in the brain. This core, however, is not the neural correlate of consciousness. Consciousness does not emerge from a single fixed place in the brain, but from a process of continuously changing neural assemblies. The core is a dynamic core. Edel man and Tononi picture neural coalitions in constant competition with each other, which makes their hypothesis a form of neural Darwinism. To me, it is unclear, though, what determines which processes are recruited in this core, that is, why certain clusters become conscious and others do not.</page><page sequence="10">146 D. Vliegenthart / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 33 (2011) 137-171 Edelman and Tononi (2000a, p. 147) believe the dynamic core hypothesis avoids the categorical error of assuming there are certain static parts of the brain that are mysteriously correlated to consciousness. In my opinion, how ever, their theory still leaves intact the explanatory gap between objective brain states and subjective states of consciousness. Tononi (2007, p. 297) counters that integrated information is subjective experience.5 This leads him to conclude they have solved the hard problem of consciousness, why matter becomes imagination. I disagree, since it is perfectly conceivable that the brain would go on doing the same thing, without the witness. The question is why nature mounted a feeling of what integrated information is like onto the inte gration itself. Global Workspace Theory Why the brain might cause consciousness is answered by the global workspace theory of Baars (e.g., 1997, 2007). "Global workspace theory (GWT) suggests that the brain has a fleeting integrative capacity that enables access between functions that are otherwise separate" (Baars, 2007, p. 240). GWT thinks of consciousness as a kind of "blackboard" where messages from specialized parts or clusters within the brain are posted, in order to make their information available for other sections of the brain. A metaphor that Baars (1997, p. 41) himself often uses, is that of a theatre. Though all we see are the passing events on the stage, we know, behind the scenes, the director, stagehands, and spot light operators are working hard to put on an entertaining show. GWT intuitively "fits." It tells how we are able to process vast amounts of information, in spite of our narrow window of awareness. Consciousness is serially limited. It can only pay attention to one thing at a time and with a remarkable amount of guesswork at that. Most of the synchronic processing of information takes place unconsciously. Were we to deal with reality in succes sion, one slice after another, the way consciousness does, we would have become extinct as a species long ago. The time it would take us to gather imminent danger from a sinister rustling of leaves, flashes of yellow and a bone chilling growl, would have been enough for every self-respecting sabre tooth to work his way to desert, before we even realized we were about to become its 51 Tononi's (e.g., 2004, 2007) integrated information theory of consciousness (IIT) could be seen as a spin off from the dynamic core hypothesis he developed together with Edelman. In a nutshell, the IIT builds on the notion of consciousness as integration and differentiation. To calculate the repertoire of available states within a system, he uses the symbol (j&gt; (phi), which measures the degree of consciousness based on the amount of information that gets lost when a connection within a system is severed.</page><page sequence="11">D. Vliegenthart I Archive for the Psychology of Religion 33 (2011) 137-171 147 dinner. Reality relendessly bombards us with signals, which requires fast paral lel processing. GWT tells us most of this happens unconsciously by specialized parts of the brain and that only a fraction of it makes it onto the stage. The payoff for limited capacity seems to be vast access, Baars (1997, p. 40) surmises. In answering why we have consciousness, Baars says that in dealing with prob lems "you just hope that your brain is equipped to help you cope" (1997, p. 158, emphasis mine). The trials and tribulations we are faced with today differ from those of our ancestors, but this coping function of our brain will have remained the same. The question that comes to mind, then, yet again, is why we require consciousness at all, if, as Baars maintains, the brain as such is already up to the task. It seems the feeling of what it is like to have conscious ness is yet to be accounted for. I think, Chalmers (2007, p. 230) is right about GWT being a theory about global accessibility rather than about conscious ness, because it still does not say why shared information should become con scious in some "Cartesian theatre." Multiple Drafts Theory The Cartesian theatre brings us to Dennett.6 Dennett (1991, p. 107) discards the idea of a "crucial finish line or boundary somewhere in the brain, marking a place where the order of arrival equals the order of presentation in experi ence because what happens there is what you are conscious of." Instead, Den nett (1991, p. Ill) submits a multiple drafts theory, which states that all mental activity ensues through parallel, multitrack processes of interpretation and elaboration of sensory input. There is no "stream of consciousness," where the finished drafts of our experiences come together in a single narrative. Rather, there are various narratives in different stages of editing that create the sense of a stream of consciousness whenever they are probed. This happens, for instance, when we are asked a question, as Schneider (2007, p. 314) explains. Dennett's theory deals with the body-mind problem quite unlike any other we have discussed so far. He does not have to explain why certain processes become conscious and others do not, since for him no such distinction exists, 6) Considering Dennett discharges any notion of a theatre of consciousness, it is all the more surprising he embraces Baars's global workspace theory (Schneider, 2007, p. 318). Although Baars keeps saying the theatre is only a metaphor (Blackmore, 2005, p. 16), I cannot escape the feeling that he still thinks of consciousness as a stage in the spotlight that we are continuously aware of and not just when probed (Schneider, 2007, p. 319). If so, it should go against the whole point behind the multiple drafts theory. I must confess, I am stumped, but I will not try to figure out the tension between their theories here.</page><page sequence="12">148 D. Vliegenthart /Archive for the Psychology of Religion 33 (2011) 137-171 every process is conscious when probed. The multiple drafts theory avoids the sleight of hand that pushes back the problem of consciousness to that of some homunculus, or "little man," inside our head. Nonetheless, and the reader will see this coming by now, it does not tell us why we have a feeling of what it is like to be conscious. In fact, one could, and many have, argue that Dennett does not explain, but explains away the problem of consciousness. A Definition of Consciousness There are many theories about consciousness out there, about what it is, what it does, and why we have it to begin with. Our short survey of some of these theories, though far from exhaustive, was enough to show that there are no single, conclusive answers to these questions. Neuroscientific research is mak ing headway in discoveries about neural correlates of subjective states of con sciousness, but these are what Chalmers (e.g., 2007) calls "the easy problems" of consciousness. They look at which part(s) or system(s) of the brain is involved in certain phenomenal experiences, yet they leave untouched the question why we have phenomenal experiences at all, what Chalmers (e.g., 2007) calls "the hard problem." The pattern I wanted to point out here is that, so far, most theories wrestle with the easy problems, but none takes on the hard problem. We still do not know what consciousness is, what it does or what creates it. Of course, we cannot ignore the overwhelming neuroscientific evidence, showing consciousness is somehow correlated to the brain, but, and this, to my mind, is too often too easily overlooked; we cannot infer a causal relation, based on everything we know or rather do not know. When it comes to consciousness, our ignorance far exceeds our knowledge. We should keep this in mind, as we work our way towards neurotheology. Seeing as there are no conclusive answers yet, I will stick to a generally accepted definition of consciousness,7 summarized by Zeman (2002, pp. 16-21). 7) Perhaps I should add, this definition of consciousness only holds in a cognitive philosophical setting, such as we are concerned with here. Were we to shift our attention to a religious tradition like Advaita Vedanta, the meaning would change entirely. In Advaita, consciousness is the divine principle, Brahman. It is all there is and we are one with it (Nikhilananda, 1946/1989, p. 14). The Chandogya Upanishad (Olivelle, 2008, 6.8.7) famously captures this philosophy in the phrase tat tvam asi, "thou art that." According to the Advaitin, consciousness cannot be defined as experience, since it is the witness of all experiences, the background against which everything appears. Experience implies an object, some thing, whereas consciousness is neti, neti, "not this, not this" (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4.4.22). Consciousness is no thing, yet nothing can be more meaningful to us, for its meaning consists in the manifestation of all objects. This shows the importance of accurately defining key concepts and delineating the area to which they apply.</page><page sequence="13">D. Vliegenthart / Archive for the Psychology ofReligion 33 (2011) 137-171 149 According to Zeman, there are three ways of looking at consciousness. First of all, being conscious is being awake, "rather... than asleep or concussed, coma tose, dead drunk, anaesthetised or in a hypnotic trance." Second of all, it is experience, or a feeling of something it is like. Consciousness as experience is intentional, being conscious ^/something, as well as personal and aspectual, or what I would simply call subjective, having a limited point of view that is not immediately accessible to others. Zeman considers the mind a third perspec tive on consciousness, which encompasses "all that we can know, think, mean, intend, all that we can hope, wish, remember or believe." I think this need lessly complicates things. In my opinion, "wakefulness" and "experience" already cover the mind. Religious Experience Having defined consciousness as wakeful experience, I now turn to a specific kind of experience, the religious kind. Religious experience is often equated with mystical experience. Before we endeavour to define this type of experi ence, we should bear in mind, though, that "religion" and "mysticism," as well as their adjectives "religious" and "mystical," are relatively recent, Occidental inventions (e.g., Certeau, 1992; King, 1999; Schmidt, 2003). Another preliminary remark concerns the second part of the equation, "experience." Proudfoot (1985, pp. 216-217, 229), whom we shall hear more of momentarily, points out, rightly so, I think, that experience is an ambigu ous concept. It can be used to indicate how something appears to someone, with no regard for the accuracy of the appearance, or to indicate how someone perceives something, where the object perceived is presumed to exist. Proud foot uses the example of a woodsman who is struck with fear when confronted with a bear on the trail, which, at second glance, turns out to be a fallen log. Though appearing as a bear, he is really perceiving a log. Yet we speak of "expe rience," either way. This ambiguity is common in religion, for instance, when we talk about experiencing God; fana, moksha, nirvana, the Real, etc. For a concise presentation of the Advaitic view on consciousness, I recommend the minor works ascribed to Shankara, such as the Upadeshasahasri (Jagadananda, 1979), Atmabodha (Nikhilananda, 1946/1989), Drg-Drsya Viveka (Nikhilananda, 1931/2007), Vivekachudamani (Prabhavananda &amp; Isherwood, 1947/1975), Aparokshanubhuti (Vimuktananda, 1938/2005), or the Vedantasara of Sadananda (Nikhilananda, 1923/1990), and the philosophical interpretations of Deutsch (1973) and Gupta (e.g., 1998, 2003).</page><page sequence="14">150 D. VLiegenthart / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 33 (2011) 137-171 One of the most prominent characters within the religious arena, who has shaped our modern understanding of religious experience, is Friedrich Schleiermacher. For this reason, I will focus on his philosophy, particularly, the way Proudfoot (1985) portrays it in his Religious Experience. Proudfoot considers Schleiermacher one of the first to exploit the inherent ambiguity of experience, to employ what he calls a "protective strategy" that shields religion from critical inquiry. "Schleiermachers claim that religious experience is inde pendent of concepts and beliefs functions as a protective strategy. It precludes any conflict between religious beliefs and the results of scientific inquiry" (Proudfoot, 1985, p. 233). His criticism will be our starting point here. Proudfoot versus Schleiermacher In 1799, Schleiermacher (1799/2008) issued five speeches under the title On Religion. They were addressed at the cultured elite, who had turned their backs on all things spiritual. The gist of his message is that religion is rooted in an ineffable, pre-reflective8 mystical experience, which has nothing to do with ethics or metaphysics (Adams, 2004, p. 71). In his speeches he talks about a "feeling" or an "intuition" (Schleiermacher, 1799/2008, pp. 22, 24, 29, 31). In The Christian Faith he recasts it into the more concrete "feeling of absolute dependence" (Schleiermacher, 1830/1948, pp. 12-18). The feeling of absolute dependence9 is the highest of three grades of con sciousness, to wit the lower or animal grade, the middle or sensible grade, and the higher grade (Schleiermacher, 1830/1948, pp. 18-26). The higher grade 8) Following Roy (1997, p. 221), "pre-reflective" does not mean "unconscious." This distinction is important, because if we place religious experience at the center of religion, the way Schleier macher does, without being to some extent conscious of that experience, we would render reli gion cognitively void. We would not even have religion, for how could we talk about something we are not aware of? The fact that we can proves it is not unconscious, at least, not fully. Note, however, that this says nothing about whether intuition should be placed at the center of reli gion, only if it is, that it must be conscious. 9) Schleiermacher speaks of ein schlechthinniges Abhängigkeitsgefühl. In the English translation, this becomes a "feeling of absolute dependence." Behrens (1998) argues that English renderings omit in their interpretations a subtle ambiguity Schleiermacher plays with in German. In the original, Schleiermacher speaks of "a feeling of absolute dependence" and "an absolute feeling of dependence." The two expressions are not equivalent. The first emphasizes the relation between the finite individual and the Infinite, the second underscores the subjective experience of that relation. The point is that we could have an absolute feeling of dependence, even if our relation to that which we depend on is not absolute. However, in his reply to Behrens, Finlay (2005) explains that Schleiermacher thought of these variations as a unit, "above" the usual grammatical conventions. Following Finlay, I will stick to a "feeling of absolute dependence."</page><page sequence="15">D. Vliegenthart/Archive for the Psychology of Religion 33 (2011) 137-171 151 can again be considered from below as "immediate self-consciousness" or from above as "God-consciousness." Both are closely connected to the feeling of absolute dependence, but immediate self-consciousness tilts toward the sub ject or self, emphasizing feeling, whereas God-consciousness tilts toward the object or God, emphasizing intuition (Reardon, 1989, p. 38). Strictly speak ing, though, God or the Infinite is not an object.10 We cannot experience it but through the finite forms of our mind. God-consciousness, then, is not so much about God, as it is about "man's consciousness of Gods presence to man" (Schleiermacher in Scott, 1968, p. 505). It appears, for Schleiermacher, religion is not concerned with the transcendent, but with our "human response to the transcendent," as Hick (2004) would say. We will return to Hick later. First, we flesh out Proudfoot's critique of Schleiermacher's religious experience. Proudfoot takes issue with the supposition that a religious experience is an ineffable, pre-reflective state, best described as a feeling of absolute depen dence on God, the Infinite, the Whence of our being, or whatever label we like to use to indicate the transcendent that lies beyond us. He believes that Schleiermacher wants to have it both ways, talking about an experience that surpasses all concepts, while using concepts to define that very same experi ence (Proudfoot, 1985, p. 11). Proudfoot stands in a long line of constructiv ists, who are convinced, as Katz puts it, that "there are NO pure (i.e. unmediated) experiences' (1978, p. 26, italics in original). Every experience, and that includes religious ones, already contains some form of cognition. Just think about it, says Proudfoot (1985, p. 21): "a feeling of absolute dependence" implies the notion of something we depend on. Proudfoot thinks Schleiermacher ignores the fact that religious experiences always occur within a sociohistorical contexts that should be taken into con sideration, when trying to define what constitutes a religious experience. The recognition of a religious experience requires a conceptual frame. Therefore, "religious experience, like any experience, must be specified from the subjects point of view," which means that "the distinguishing mark of a religious expe rience is not the subject matter but the kind of explanation the subject believes is appropriate" (Proudfoot, 1985, p. 229, 231). Taves (2008) would say that an experience is religious when deemed religious by the experient, when he or she attributes to it characteristics related to their religion. I0) Everything resides in God and that which lets all things be cannot be a thing itself, Frank (2005, p. 24) argues. "If God were a being among beings, God could not be the source of all that is. God would simply be another piece of the furniture of the cosmos," Farley (2008, p. 150) adds.</page><page sequence="16">152 D. Vliegenthart / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 33 (2011) 137-171 The constructivist and attributional approaches compete with the suigeneris point of view, to which Schleiermacher ascribes, which maintains there are experiences that are intrinsically religious and "simply and self-evidently 'out there,' unique and easily identified, like ripe fruit on a tree just waiting to be picked" (McCutcheon, 1997, p. 6). Schleiermacher was an essentialist, no doubt, albeit not in the naïve way Proudfoot has us believe, for he was very explicit about religion being a finite rendition of the Infinite that cannot be known in its pure form (Schleier macher, 1799/2008, p. 21). As Nassar (2006, p. 810) says, "the divine or infinite never reveals itself immediately, or 'as such,' but rather, it always reveals itself indirectly, in something distinct but not separate from itself, namely, the finite particular." The feeling may be immediate; the expression of it will be mediated by the nature of experient (Schleiermacher, 1799/2008, pp. 24-25) and his or her social, cultural, and historical baggage. Though Proudfoot seems to suggest otherwise, Schleiermacher was very much aware of the sociohistori cal context surrounding religious experiences (Dole, 2008; Reynolds, 2002). The difference is that Schleiermacher did not think the experience itself is mediated. A Definition of Religious Experience Now, where do I stand in this interesting discussion on religious experience? I disagree with Proudfoot about religious experiences being completely con structed. I do not exclude the possibility that there is a pre-reflective compo nent in them inseparable from its cognitive expressions, not unlike the relationship between the finite and the Infinite in Schleiermacher. However, anticipating Hick and Azari, I have to agree with Proudfoot about experiences, even religious ones, being at least partially constructed. The frame of reference of experients will, to some extent, colour their description of the experience. Consciousness does not have to be an experience of something, but an experi ence is by definition a consciousness of something. This "something" can be a feeling or a thought, though I am reluctant to separate the two. I believe feel ings and thoughts coalesce into a single composite experience. I presume them to have an affective as well as a cognitive side. I come back to this when we look at Azari, but first I want to introduce Hick. Hick (e.g., 2001, 2004) could be considered the intellectual grandchild of Schleiermacher. In my opinion, Hick's theory on religion, as expounded in An Interpretation of Religion, resembles and improves upon that of Schleiermacher, in many ways. Just as Schleiermacher, Hick (2004, p. xix) presupposes an inef</page><page sequence="17">D. Vliegenthart / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 33 (2011) 137-171 153 fable, or "transcategorical," reality, which he calls "the Real." Despite his warn ing to others not to equate ultimate reality with a personal God in the interreligious debate (Hick, 2001, p. 207), Hick's own notion of the Real still carries over a subtle theism from his Western, Christian background into his religious pluralism (Deutsch, 1990; Lee, 1998). Sumner Twiss (1990, p. 535) makes a similar observation about the striking tension in the very "basement" of Hicks theory between a Wittgensteinian approach that views religious dis course as linguistic rather than referential and a view of religious discourse built on the assumption of an ontologically real ultimate divine. Hick (2004, p. 249) admits to this, but claims that "the divine noumenon is a necessary postulate of the pluralistic religious life of humanity." In the face of an ambig uous reality that allows for "being thought and experienced in both naturalis tic and religious ways" (Hick, 2004, p. 73), Hick (2004, p. 210) makes a "basic cognitive choice" for the religious interpretation. To explain the diver sity within his religious reality, he has to postulate a divine noumenon. We become aware of this noumenon in religious experience, says Hick (2000, p. 40), which is the joint product of the presence of the "Transcen dent," another term he likes to use, and our own conceptual systems and spir itual practices. "Religious experience, then, is structured by religious beliefs, and religious beliefs are implicit within religious experience," which will, thus, take on "different shapes within the different traditions," he adds (Hick, 2004, p. 172)." It is in this respect that Hick improves on Schleiermacher, for he brings their shared essentialist philosophy closer to Proudfoot's social con structivism. His pluralistic hypothesis takes the sociocultural context into account, suggesting that religious experiences constitute personal and nonper sonal encounters with the Real as "being thought-and-experienced through the lens of a particular human mind-set" (Hick, 2004, p. 294). I can now string these strands together into a definition of religious experi ence. I define religious experience as "a state of consciousness in which reality is deemed religious and thought and experienced through the lens of a par ticular human mind-set."12 Let me be clear, though, that by employing the Borrowing the term from Buddhism, Hick (1991) suggests every tradition is an upaya, "skill ful means," that is, one path among many of reaching the soteriological goal of salvation or liberation. I2) "A reality deemed religious" is itself part of "the particular mind-set" through which reality is filtered. I separate the two, perhaps somewhat forcefully, to emphasize that the deeming of reality as religious is a "basic cognitive choice" (Hick, 2004, p. 210) that precedes religious thought and religious experience.</page><page sequence="18">154 D. Vliegenthart/Archive for the Psychology of Religion 33 (2011) 137-171 word "deem," 1 do not exclude the possibility of things and experiences having an intrinsic religious quality. Religious States of Consciousness To summarize what we have learned so far: consciousness constitutes experi ence, or what it is like. What it is like to have a religious experience, subjec tively, is to know the divine, whatever one understands it to be, objectively, to be in a state of consciousness in which reality is experienced as religious through the cognitive filter of a particular mind-set. In this third and final part of my paper, we find out what neuroscientific research on religious states of consciousness contributes to the discussion. Epileptic Religion Schachter (2006, p. 171) starts his chapter on religion and the brain with a telling quote from Saver and Rabin, who say that "all human experience is brain-based, including scientific reasoning, mathematical deduction, moral judgment, and artistic creation, as well as religious states of mind." The major ity of researchers in the field of neuroscience are convinced religious experi ences are in the brain.13 This belief can often be traced to reports on religious behaviour in patients suffering from temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Several studies mentioned in Schachter (2006) concerning the relation between TLE and religious behaviour suggest, albeit not conclusively, there may be some thing there. Some of the early studies that focused on excessive temporal lobe activity were conducted by Persinger (e.g., 1983), a hardcore materialist who has writ ten dozens of controversial articles that walk a tight rope between neurosci ence and theology. He concluded, religious experiences are normal effects of temporal lobe function (Schachter, 2006, p. 181). Persinger and colleagues (e.g., Persinger &amp; Healey, 2002; Persinger &amp; Tiller, 2008) went on to see whether these experiences might be artificially induced. They devised what is popularly called the "God-helmet," which emits weak complex magnetic fields that mimic the neural activity of an epileptic seizure. What they found is that activation of the temporal lobe can give rise to a "sensed presence" of another 131 A recent survey of more than 2,000 respondents, half of which healthcare workers and medi cal professionals, shows, however, many higher educated people in the field still entertain dualis tic and religious ideas (Demertzi, et al., 2009).</page><page sequence="19">D. Vliegenthart / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 33 (2011) 137-171 155 consciousness. This led Persinger to believe that when seizure-like impulses allow the sense of self from the right hemisphere into the awareness of the left hemisphere, the brain interprets it as the presence of something supernatural outside, which the mind then construes as God (Schjoedt, 2009, p. 321).14 TLE patients often relate their epileptic experiences in a religious vocabu lary. Some of them even turn "hyperreligious," in the interictal periods between seizures. I believe, however, we should be careful not to confuse a pathological preoccupation with religion with normal religious experiences. Even though Persinger and colleagues conducted experiments on healthy subjects, repeat experiments by independent researchers are required, before we can safely apply their conclusions to the general public. Granqvist et al. (2005) are among the first to have performed such a repeat experiment, albeit with a slightly different, arguably sounder, methodology and design. They concluded that the application of weak complex magnetic fields did not cause a "sensed presence" of a supernatural being or any of the other somatosensory experiences described by Persinger and colleagues (Granqvist, et al., 2005, p. 5). Instead, they found that personality character istics indicative of suggestibility were significantly correlated with such extraor dinary experiences, in both religious and nonreligious participants. According to them, the discrepancy between their findings and those of Persinger can probably be explained by methodological differences in the design of the experiments. Responding to Granqvist and colleagues, Persinger and Koren (2005, pp. 346-347) suggest three alternative causes for the diverging results. The software might not have been calibrated to create similar conditions using dif ferent hardware, the duration of the experiments may have been too short, and the smaller dimensions of the acoustic chamber where the tests were con ducted could have affected the outcome. Larsson, Larhammar, Fredrikson, and Granqvist (2005), who were involved in the repeat experiment, defuse these alternatives. The computer program was properly calibrated, they say, the time frame of the experiment was based on Persinger's own recommenda tions, and since the participants were blindfolded, the idea that room size was of any influence seems "far-fetched and confusing" (Larsson, Larhammar, Fredrikson, &amp; Granqvist, 2005, p. 348). Emphasizing the importance for double-blindness, mainly because it is a tried and tested method that has been shown to control and minimize placebo-producing variables, they conclude I4) A recent case study by Landtblom (2006) shows such a "sensed presence" is not always inter preted in a religious way.</page><page sequence="20">156 D. Vliegenthart / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 33 (2011) 137-171 that the burden of proof falls back on Persinger (Larsson, Larhammar, Fredrik son, &amp; Granqvist, 2005, p. 349). I agree. Persinger has not yet shown that weak complex magnetic fields can incite a "sensed presence" that is often inter preted in religious terms, using conventionally accepted methods. On top ofthat, both theTLE and non-TLE subjects in Persingers experi ments describe their religious experiences as encounters with personal deities, such as "God, Allah, an angel or a spirit" (Persinger &amp; Healey, 2002, p. 533). Nowhere, to my knowledge, does Persinger look into some of the thoroughly different religious experiences of impersonal religious objects. Or to borrow Hick's terms, Persinger focuses on the Personae of the Real (Hick, 2004, Chapter 15) and ignores the Impersonae of the Real (Hick, 2004, Chapter 16). This, too, seriously limits the validity and applicability of his conclusions concerning religious experiences and religion in general. Absolute Unitary Being D'Aquili and Newberg (e.g., D'Aquili, 1982; D'Aquili &amp; Newberg, 1993; Newberg, 2006) stay much closer to what I deem a normal religious experi ence than Persinger does. By looking at long-term religious practitioners, such as Tibetan monks and Christian nuns (Newberg, Alavi, Baime, Pourdehnad, Santanna, &amp; D'Aquili, 2001), who in theory should embody the ethical pre cepts of their respective religions, they make an effort to study "the real thing." Though still far from infallible, this approach does make their work more reli able and usable. In addition, they are looking for stable experiences, instead of transitory ones, such as drug induced states or epileptic fits (D'Aquili, 1982, p. 368). This further adds to their credibility. The stable religious experience they are targeting is referred to as "Absolute Unitary Being." According to D'Aquili and Newberg, the experience of Abso lute Unitary Being can be found both in the East and in the West. It is often interpreted either personally as the encounter with an anthropomorphic deity, like God, Allah, or Ishvara, or nonpersonally as the Godhead, Void, Brahman, Samadhi, or Nirvana (D'Aquili &amp; Newberg, 1993, p. 178). In order to explain these events, they call on the notion of "deafferentation," which is a fancy way of saying the neural input into a structure within the nervous system is "cut off' (D'Aquili &amp; Newberg, 1993, p. 185). D'Aquili and Newberg hypothesize the mystical sense of oneness might be prompted by an overload of the limbic structures involved in emotions, blocking input to other areas of the brain, in particular, input to the posterior superior parietal lobe, or PSPL. The PSPL is supposedly part of the brain involved in spatial location and representation of</page><page sequence="21">D. Vliegentbart / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 33 (2011) 137-171 157 the dichotomy between self and others. Loss of demarcation in space and dis crimination between self and other is what catalyses a state of Absolute Uni tary Being (Schjoedt, 2009, p. 315). The concept of Absolute Unitary Being covers a larger spectrum of religious experiences than the "sensed presence" of Persinger and seems to be based on methodologically sounder research as well. However, the theoretical frame built around it is not without shortcomings of its own, ranging from minor conceptual inconsistencies to serious conjectural flaws. The more recent pub lications of D'Aquili and Newberg, popular-scientific titles such as Why God Won't Go Away (Newberg, D'Aquili, &amp; Rause, 2001) and How God Changes Your Brain (Newberg &amp; Waldman, 2010), are particularly problematic. These books, which build and expand on the work Newberg has done with his men tor D'Aquili, but were written after the latter passed away in 1998, have been severely criticized. In a devastating review, Gezerlis (2002, p. 175) describes Why God Won't Go Away as "neither scientific, nor theological." It lacks "scien tific rigour," he goes on to say, and employs scientific terminology as "a smoke screen to lead laymen into thinking that all this is 'hard science' " (Gezerlis, 2002, p. 175, 178). Its discussion of the creation of myths, which, I agree, seems slightly superficial, according to Gezerlis (2002, p. 177), "would have made even the crudest structuralist blush." In a less hostile review of the same title, sceptic Shermer (2001, p. 54) tells us the strength of the book lies in the original research with Tibetan monks and Christian nuns, but also says that critics of sociobiology will find "much fodder" in its theory of evolutionary history. I will focus on one aspect of these books that I consider especially unconvincing, which are the metaphysical conclusions they draw from neuro scientific research. Similar to the perennial philosophy of Aldous Huxley (1945/2004), peren nial mythology of Joseph Campbell (1949/2004) and perennial psychology of Robert Forman (1998), D'Aquili and Newberg assert that "the deepest origins of religion are based in mystical experience" (Newberg, D'Aquili, &amp; Rause, 2001, p. 129), "a very intimate experience that cannot be captured by words" (Newberg &amp; Waldman, 2010, p. 82) and that "virtually all mystical traditions identify some sense of union with the absolute as the ultimate spiritual goal" (Newberg, D'Aquili, &amp; Rause, 2001, p. 103). What might be called their "perennial neurology" of religion claims "that humans have a genetically inher ited talent for entering unitary states, and that many of us interpret these states as the presence of a higher power" (Newberg, D'Aquili, &amp; Rause, 2001, p. 140). They, furthermore, suggest that the "various incarnations of God are meta phorical interpretations of the same spiritual reality—the reality experienced</page><page sequence="22">158 D. Vliegenthart / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 33 (2011) 137-171 as Absolute Unitary Being" (Newberg, D'Aquili, &amp; Rause, 2001, p. 162, 165). If they are right, then all religions and their concepts of the divine, ultimately, refer to the same unitary experience. This "transcendent unity of religions," to borrow a particularly fitting phrase of Schuon (2005), brings to mind the philosophy of Hick (2004). And just as Hick's religious pluralism cannot prove the transcendent reality that is derived from religious experiences, so, too, the perennial neurology of D'Aquili and Newberg will have to concede that it can only be postulated. Yet, throughout their work, the neurotheologists clearly insist on the existence of a metaphysical reality beyond our own. However, knowing the devil is in the details, they meticulously choose their words to avoid statements their research cannot corroborate. There would be nothing wrong with this, if their phrasing did not have a tendency to blur their unver ified beliefs with scientifically proven facts. The following quote is an example of this fine line they are walking between confirmed and conjectural truths. After years of scientific study, Newberg (Newberg, D'Aquili, &amp; Rause, 2001, p. 9) reminisces, in the opening chapter of Why God Won't Go Away, Gene and I further believed that we saw evidence of a neurological process that has evolved to allow us humans to transcend material existence and acknowledge and con nect with a deeper, more spiritual part of ourselves perceived of as an absolute, univer sal reality that connects us to all that is. Newberg is not actually claiming that he and D'Aquili had found proof of a higher reality. What he is saying is that they believed there is evidence for a connection to something that is perceived as a higher reality. In other words, we are dealing as much with beliefs and perceptions as with evidence and facts. The phenomenal experience of oneness may very well be real. It may even be correlated to neurological activity. That still does not prove the existence of a transcendent reality, which is what they seem to imply. In all fairness, I am being slightly polemical here, because D'Aquili and Newberg (Newberg, D'Aquili, &amp; Rause, 2001, pp. 53, 126, 143; Newberg &amp; Waldman, 2010, pp. 4-5, 248) do, at times, admit that their studies are not conclusively proving the existence of a spiritual reality or supporting anything more than the sense of the realness of whatever one considers to be God. Their neurobiological model offers an explanation for the experience of Absolute Unitary Being but cannot determine whether it is nothing but a brain state or the essence of what is most fundamentally real. My main critique is that can did remarks like these generally get lost among more doubtful assertions that</page><page sequence="23">D. Vliegenthart /Archive for the Psychology of Religion 33 (2011) 137-171 159 are joined to unwarranted conclusions. In the same context, for instance, Newberg, D'Aquili, and Rause (2001, p. 143, 172) contend that: mystics are not necessarily victims of delusion, rather, their experiences are based in observable functions of the brain. The neurological roots of these experiences would render them as convincingly real as any other of the brain's perceptions. In this sense, the mystics are not talking nonsense; they are reporting genuine, neurobiological events... The realness of Absolute Unitary Being is not conclusive proof that a higher God exists, but it makes a strong case that there is more to human existence than sheer material existence. The fact that a phenomenon of the mind can be observed in the brain does not make it real, beyond the subjective perception of it. I may be convinced I am a lamp and stand in the corner all day, waiting for someone to switch me on by twisting my nose. The feeling of joy I get from brightening up the room will be visible in my brain. That does not mean I am actually emitting light. I do not deny the realness of mystical experiences as neurological events or that these events can "feel as solidly real as any other experience of reality" (New berg, D'Aquili, &amp; Rause, 2001, p. 160). I am actually quite open to the idea that mystical or unitary experiences are not necessarily delusions. My point is that all experiences, including delusional ones, are correlated to activity in the brain (e.g., Gezerlis, 2002, p. 177) and that we cannot use brain activity as a valid argument for the verity of the content of certain experiences. Yet that is exactly what D'Aquili and Newberg seem to be doing. The Limits ofNeurotheology Nina Azari, a multidisciplinary scholar trained in neuroscience and religious studies, attacks the popular "limbic marker hypothesis," advocated, among others, by Joseph (2001), Ramachandran and Blakeslee (1998), and the scien tists we are focusing on here, Persinger (1983) and D'Aquili and Newberg (1993). The hypothesis states that religious experiences require (dysfunctional) brain activity in the limbic structures, suggesting that religious experiences stem from, to use the words of Azari and Slors (2007, p. 69), "a primitive brain-reflex response, for which thoughts and beliefs of the experient are of little (if any) importance." In their search for the neural correlate of religious experiences, Azari et al. (2001) studied the effects of psalm recitation on six self-proclaimed Chris tians, who took the Bible as the literal word of God. Following Proudfoot,</page><page sequence="24">160 D. Vliegenthart / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 33 (2011) 137-171 Azari et al. (2001, p. 1651) considered an experience religious if it was inter preted as such by the subject and determined the attainment of this target state solely on the grounds of subjective self-assessment. Their results showed that during their religious experience the Christian participants revealed sig nificant cognitive activity15 and no activation of limbic areas (Azari et al., 2001, p. 1649, 1651), which seems to refute the limbic marker hypothesis. In a later reassessment of their own (Azari, Missimer, &amp; Seitz, 2005, p. 274) and other studies (Newberg, Alavi, Baime, Pourdehnad, Santanna, &amp; D'Aquili, 2001) Azari, Missimer, and Seitz speculate that the kind of cognitivity found in religious experiences might be relational, since they involve parts of the brain that are critical for reasoning processes in social interaction. This leads Azari and colleagues to theorize that what makes an experience religious is a perceived relationship with a divine object, say God or the Void, and not the divine object itself (Azari, 2006, p. 44; Azari et al., 2005, p. 275). My critique on Azari does not concern the target group, like with Persinger, but the target experience. Or rather, the way the experience is determined, by solely relying on the subjects assessment, without compensating for the fact that especially this type of fanatic believers might be eager to "prove" their faith. I am exaggerating to make my point, but the attitude I assume these subjects to bring to the experiment may prime (auto-)suggestion or mislead ing testimonies. Apart from that, it is at least reasonable to presume the sub jects were influenced by the presence of the researchers, who are "seeing into their brain" to examine those wonderful religious experiences they claim to have. It could very well have been this relationship with the researchers, and not with any religious object, that explains the activation of the prefrontal and medial frontal cortex involved in social cognition. These nuances need to be taken into consideration, in order to avoid polluted data or misguided conclusions. Nonetheless, if we take them at face value, Azari et al. (2001) and Newberg et al. (2001) do present a strong case against the widespread assumption that religious experiences are purely emotional. Surprisingly, though, Azari and Birnbacher (2004) do not refute their emotional character, but instead rede fine emotions. They submit that "all human experience, emotional and reli gious, is a complex matter of embodied thinking and feeling" (Azari &amp; Birnbacher, 2004, p. 906). In other words, a feeling is established by its cogni I5) Elsewhere, Azari and Birnbacher (2004, p. 905) clarify that "Cognitive in this context is taken to refer, at the minimum, to beliefs about or an interpretation concerning an object or a state of affair:</page><page sequence="25">D. Vliegenthart / Archive for the Psychology ofReligion 33 (2011) 137-171 161 tive context. This "field of belief" determines its shape, by attributing "some kind of evaluation, appraisal or judgment concerning the context in which the experience occurs"16 (Azari &amp; Birnbacher, 2004, p. 912). This reminds me of Schleiermacher (1830/1948, pp. 21-22), forwhom abstract feeling of absolute dependence gains its concrete "definiteness and clearness... from its being related to the determination of the sensible self-consciousness." I wonder, though, if Schleiermacher would have subscribed to their conclusion, which fuses feeling and thought, by defining religious experience as a "thinking that feels like something" (Azari &amp; Birnbacher, 2004, p. 912). The strong point of Azari and Birnbachers original definition of religious experience is that it marries the opposites of Schleiermacher's feeling-based essentialism to Proudfoots social constructivism and Taves's attributionalism, without closing the door to Hick's transcendentalism. Its weak point is that it only clarifies the how of a religious experience and not the what. It does not explain what it is that makes a religious experience different from any other experience. Apart from denoting it as relational, Azari leaves the what of religious expe riences unresolved and jumps from the experience to religion as such. Azari and Slors (2007, p. 81) argue that neuroscientific studies cannot explain reli gion. Even if neurotheology could shed some light on religious experiences and we take religious experience as the essence of religion, it would still not explain why we have religion to begin with. Their argument rests on two explicit and one implicit theoretical constraints. The noncircularity constraint is rather straightforward. If we use a religious tradition to explain the rise of religion, our explanation would not include the rise of this particular tradition, for that would get us stuck in a vicious circle. Since this goes for all traditions, a neurotheological theory on religion cannot fall back on any of them. The sufficiency constraint is a bit more of a slippery slope. It grants a ceteris paribus clause. Aside from brain properties, other background conditions have to be met, to account for the rise of religion. Language and the availability of conditions for physical survival, for instance, are also required. These may be trivially assumed. But apart from such basic conditions, no other conditions may 16) Specifically about the religious field of belief they state, "Religious experience operates within a field of believing; the belief affords the space for the experience. Hence, the belief does not as such entet the scene but functions as a background condition guiding the way the believer inter prets and evaluates his or her relation to the world as well as to the being to which this person feels religiously related" (Azari &amp; Birnbacher, 2004, p. 912).</page><page sequence="26">162 D. Vliegenthart / Archive for the Psychology ofReligion 33 (2011) 137-171 be introduced, because, then, the neuroscientific data would not be sufficient to explain religion. The slipperiness lies in drawing the line, deciding if some thing still counts as a background condition or is a gratuitous supplement. The triangulation constraint is not defined as a third constraint by Azari and Slors (2007, p. 76), though it functions as such. This rule states that for a public belief like religion to arise, multisensory corroboration or interpersonal confirmation is necessary to substantiate it. Crudely put, this means different parts of the same brain or the same part of different brains need to confirm the underlying experience. The question is whether this "extra (quasi) epistemic warrant" is available in neurotheology. The answer is no. "There is no other sense-modality by means of which we can experience the same religious real ity," nor can we "observe another subject observe or experience the numeri cally same reality that we are observing or experiencing" (Azari &amp; Slors, 2007, p. 76). The triangulation constraint quite simply nullifies neurotheological explanations of religion altogether, because it violates the sufficiency constraint by definition. A neurotheological theory always needs to rely on sociological, psychological, and epistemological considerations too substantial to count as mere background conditions (Azari &amp; Slors, 2007, p. 77). If their constraints are valid, Azari and Slors are right to conclude that neu rotheology will never be able to account for the emergence of religion. Azari mentions something else, though, which could reinforce her position even more, yet she hardly reflects on it. Based on Azari et al. (2001) and Newberg et al. (2001), Azari and colleagues claim religious experiences are a relational kind of experience. The religious-««* of an experience, Azari et al. (2005, p. 275) reckon, is more a matter of the how of the experience, rather than the what or the presumed object of it. In other words, what makes an experience religious is not, say, God, but the perceived relationship with God. But if reli gious experiences, in fact, turn out to be a kind of experience, then it will be impossible to localize them in the brain, like some "God-spot" (Azari, 2006, p. 42), because they will not be specific enough to be differentiated from sim ilar nonreligious experiences (Azari &amp; Birnbacher, 2004, p. 910). Though dealing with an entirely unrelated subject matter, the study of Becerra, Breiter, Wise, Gonzalez, and Borsook (2001) further clarifies what I mean. Their research has shown that pain can activate cerebral areas typically associated with pleasure. Now, if the processes involved with the evaluation of rewards and those involved with the evaluation of threats are the same, simply put, if pain and pleasure look identical in the brain, then we cannot distinguish one from the other without additional non-neurological information. In relation</page><page sequence="27">D. Vliegenthart / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 33 (2011) 137-171 163 to religious and similar nonreligious experiences, this would mean that phe nomenal insights into the divine prove neurologically blind. Conclusion Is God hiding in the brain? This is a misleading question, of course, because it already presumes there is a God. If we look past the rhetoric of the metaphor, it inquires whether a reality perceived religiously tells us something about the perceiver or about reality. Before answering that question, we should ask our selves, in true postmodern fashion, if there could even be a reality, religious or otherwise, apart from a perspective. Proudfoot believes reality is in the eye of the beholder. This contradicts the kind of a sui generis religion Schleiermacher had in mind, turning religious experiences into contextually determined states of consciousness that attribute a religious quality to events. If religious phenomena really are in the eye of the beholder, we have stum bled on a vicious circle. My objective assessment of the veracity of your subjec tive religious experience depends on the assumptions of my own conceptual frame, which is just as subjective. This amounts to the endless discussions about opposing religious claims in interfaith dialogues. The problem is that if we cannot decide phenomenally what makes an experience religious, neuro logically we cannot find its correlate either. The fact that we are unable to find them does not mean, of course, that religious experiences are not in the brain. Let us assume religious experiences do turn out to be neurological. It would bring a smile and a tear to those who ascribe religious experiences, their own and those of the saints and sages in their tradition, to something objective. A smile, because it would vindicate their experiences, elevating them from pos sible illusion to decided reality, a tear, because it could tear away the deepest source of meaning in their lives, by ruling out a transcendent cause.17 Whether or not it makes the experiences any less religious depends on the interpretation of the word. If "religious" means the existence of an external being, we may have to reconsider our belief. This goes for Schleiermacher and perhaps, to some extent, for Hick. If "religious" means a sense of oneness with everything there is, we may not, considering the phenomenal experience will be no less real. This is the direction D'Aquili and Newberg are heading. Even if religious experiences are reducible to the brain, comments D'Aquili (1982, p. 379), it 17) Not fully, of course; the Transcendent could have made our brain a catalyst for religious experiences.</page><page sequence="28">164 D. Vliegenthart /Archive for the Psychology of Religion 33 (2011) 137-171 does not alter "the subjective sensation of the objective reality of the experi ence." Were we to translate this into Searlian language, we could say a religious experience may be causally reduced to the brain, but not ontologically. Most neuroscientists, however, are not interested in the ontological reach of religious experiences. They are not in it to see whether God exists or not; they want to know what goes on inside the brain. Whether changes in brain activity during religious experiences are caused by the experience or respond to the experience is of no interest to them, because it cannot be decided upon (New berg &amp; Lee, 2005, p. 484). Even though many scientists in the field will be reluctant to admit it, neuroscience cannot confirm or deny the existence of a transcendent cause for religious experiences. That is, not yet, if ever. It is this ambiguity that D'Aquili and Newberg grab hold of to argue for the existence of a metaphysical reality, which is the same ambiguity their opponents use to criticize them. Because of this ambiguity, alternative views like Hicks contro versial interactionism remain possible. Hick (2010, p. 106) envisions the bond between brain and consciousness as "dancing partners who always move together but sometimes with one and sometimes the other taking the lead." Similarly, the divine could well be the dancing partner of consciousness. Who is to say? A key question in the discussion is whether religious experiences are noth ing but a neural correlate. If we look past the polemical "nothing but," this proves to be a very subtle question, since it carries with it so many assump tions. It takes for granted that each state of consciousness, including religious ones, is mirrored by a fixed neural correlate. We have seen that Edelman and Tononi (e.g., 2000a; 2000b), among others, would beg to differ. They argue for a dynamic core of consciousness, consisting of continuously changing neu ral coalitions. These coalitions are not made of stable correlates, but of special ized processes that perhaps come together in a global workspace such as Baars envisaged. There is no doubt among neuroscientists that all experiences are somehow correlated to the brain, yet the existence of a fixed neural correlate of consciousness remains a matter of debate. In addition, religious experiences seem to be (like) emotional or relational experiences. Even if they are another kind of experience, any kind of experi ence, we could still not recognize them in the brain. They would not be spe cific enough to distinguish from other forceful experiences that are not religious (Azari &amp; Birnbacher, 2004, p. 910). Just as an emotional experience is not to experience objects called emotions but to experience objects emotionally and a relational experience is not to experience objects called relations but to expe rience objects relationally, a religious experience is not to experience religious</page><page sequence="29">D. Vliegenthart/Archive for the Psychology of Religion 33 (2011) 137-171 165 objects but to experience objects religiously (Ratcliffe, 2006, pp. 88-89). Now, if experiencing objects religiously triggers regions of the brain that are also involved in nonreligious experiences, the same way pain and pleasure activate the same neural circuitry (Becerra, Breiter, Wise, Gonzalez, &amp; Borsook, 2001), we are none the wiser. I fear this could be the case for neurotheology. The biggest problem, however, is that we do not know what consciousness itself is. We do not know why there is a what it is like. There are many theories, only a fraction of which were discussed at the beginning of this paper, but none is definitive. Most neuroscientists and philosophers of mind seem con vinced consciousness is caused by the brain, but even this most basic assump tion is not supported by conclusive evidence. This is why they speak of a correlation and not causation. Yes, the body and mind are connected, but the presumed identity between them is, as Sam Harris pointed out, a faith among scientists and not a fact. Taken together, the subjective nature of religious experiences, combined with the speculative status of fixed neural correlates, the lack of a distinct neu rological character of religious experiences, and our considerable ignorance concerning consciousness make the chances of neurotheology ever coming up with the neural correlate of religious experiences seem disturbingly bleak. As long as neurotheology cannot reduce religious experiences to an objective unique neural counterpart, it cannot explain what religion is. Maybe neurotheology cannot explain what religion is, but could it perhaps explain why we have it? Based on Azari et al. (2005; 2007) and Ratcliffe (2006), my own prediction is that neurotheology alone will not be able to provide a plausible reason for the rise of religion. Even if other experiments confirm that religious experiences have a neural marker, be it in the limbic system, the prefrontal and medial frontal cortex, or posterior superior parietal lobe, it could still not account for why there is religion at all. Accepting their theoretical constraints, I think, Azari and Slors (2007) have successfully shown that neurotheology as such is not enough. It will always require sociology, psychology, or epistemology to explain religion fully, to tell us not only what it is, but also why we have it. I do not want to rush to an unwarranted conclusion, like Searle or McGinn. This may sound surprising, coming from someone who spent an entire paper debunking neurotheology. Based on my one-sided scepticism, I may have painted too gloomy of a picture of neurotheology, made it seem as if it already is a lost cause. It is not, of course. Neuroscientific studies have delivered a wealth of information about consciousness. Let us hope it can do the same for religious states of consciousness. I am confident it will. We have to be realistic,</page><page sequence="30">166 D. Vliegenthart / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 33 (2011) 137-171 though. We cannot expect neurotheology to deliver us the divine on a silver platter. It delivers the brain. Now, maybe these are the same. Maybe they are not. Maybe we will never know. There are still too many unknowns to make conclusive claims about the brain, consciousness, religion, or religious experi ences, let alone about the connections between them. This means my conclu sion cannot be more than a tentative prediction. Can neurotheology explain religion, what it is, and why we have it? I pre dict it cannot explain what religion is, because even if religious experiences are located in the brain, neurotheology will not be able to find them. And if it does somehow manage to find them, neurotheology will not be able to explain why we have religion, without resorting to theories from other disciplines. Either way, neurotheology will fail to explain religion fully. Time will tell. Meanwhile, combining disciplines will render interesting new answers to stub born old questions. Rivalled only by quantum physics, brain imaging is turn ing into the Holy Grail of science. As students of religion, we can only look forward to more of its content spilling over to our side.
