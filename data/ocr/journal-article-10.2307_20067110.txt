<plain_text><page sequence="1">JERZY MIZIOLEK The "Odyssey" Cassone Panels from the Lanckorohski Collection: On the Origins of Depicting Homer's Epic in the Art of the Italian Renaissance* To Professor Karolina Lanckoro?ska (1898-2002) In Memoriam In a letter of 1354 to Nicolaos Sigeros, Petrarch wrote: "Your Homer is dumb in my presence, or rather I am deaf in his. Nevertheless I rejoice at the mere sight of him alone and I often embrace him and say with a sigh: Oh mighty man, how I desire to hear you."1 It was Sigeros who, a few years earlier, had sent to the first poeta laureatus of the early modern age a Greek manuscript containing both The Iliad and The Odyssey. Since Petrarch's knowledge of Greek was almost non-existent, all he could do until almost the late 1360s, when he at last obtained a Latin translation of Homer's epic produced by Leonzio Pilato, was to embrace the volume received from Sigeros.2 Even if the translation was rather poor, it was an important event for both Renaissance humanism and the visual arts. The epic by the "mighty man" of antiquity could at last be "heard" in educated circles. Several episodes recounted by Homer soon appeared in both Petrarch's and Boccaccio's writings, and particularly in the latter's Genealog?a deorum gentilium. There is a well-attested tradition that Petrarch died while annotating his copy of the Odyssey translated by Leonzio.3 About eighty years later a Florentine painter, Apollonio di Giovanni (ca. 1415-1465), painted some long panels on wood depicting the Adventures of Ulysses/Odysseus. Four such paintings have survived to date.4 Two are housed in American collections: in the Art Institute in Chicago and in the Frick Art Museum in Pittsburgh, while the two remaining panels, once in the collection of Count Karol Lanckorohski in Vienna, have been in the Royal Castle in Krakow (known as the Wawel Castle)5 since October 1994 [Figs. 1,2]. All four paintings were originally the front panels of forzieri/cassoni or marriage chests, which in Renaissance Tuscany were usually executed on the occasion of weddings, and were almost always produced in pairs.6 Very often the subject depicted on such cassone panels, as on those representing The Adventures of Ulysses from the Lanckorohski collection, is a single story, a myth or a legend, shown in numerous small scenes pictured in the manner of a continuous narrative spreading over both panels. Apollonio di Giovanni's Odyssey panels, despite their notable artistic qualities and the fact that they are the earliest narrative illustrations of Homer's epic in post-antique art, have never been the subject of a separate study. This is partly due to the fact that the Lanckorohski pieces were not accessible to scholars for some fifty years. In 1939 the Lanckorohski 57</page><page sequence="2">JERZY MIZIOLEK 1) Apollonio di Giovanni, ?The Adventures of Ulysses?, cassone front, tempera on panel, Krakow, Royal Wawel Castle. collection was confiscated by the Nazis, and after its restitution in 1946 was kept in a bank in Zurich.7 After the panels arrived in Krakow they were carefully restored and cleaned and since 1997 have been on permanent display in one of the rooms on the first floor of the Wawel Castle [Fig. 30]. Unfortunately only the second painting [Fig. 2] is well preserved. The first was poorly transferred onto a new support (canvas pasted on wood) in the last quarter of the 19th century with the result that it lost its original colouring in several areas, particularly the pale blue of the background [Fig. 1].8 Even now, despite conservation work, it is much darker than its companion piece. Both panels were published for the first time by Karol Lanc korohski himself in a brochure entitled Einiges ?ber italienische bemalte Truhen of 1905, being a short presentation of most of the Italian Renaissance domestic paintings in the collection.9 He dated them from 1430-1440 and ascribed them to the Florentine School. Together with the Chicago cassone panel, they entered the well-known corpus of cassoni compiled ten years later by Paul Schubring10 and were more widely discussed by Ellen Callmann in 1974.11 Taking her point of departure from earlier research pursued by Wolfgang Stechow and Ernst H. Gombrich (who were the first to attribute several cassone panels to Apollonio himself) Callmann produced an important monograph on the painter.12 The panels now linked to this painter were previously ascribed to two (or three) anonymous artists referred to as the Master of Dido (or the Master of Virgil) and the Master of Jarves Cassoni; the former name was coined by Paul Schubring (and Attilio Schiaparelli) and the latter by Bernard Berenson.13 Callmann also published a partially preserved cassone front belonging to the Helen C. Frick collection (presently housed in the Frick Art Museum in Pittsburgh), which before was only hinted to by scholars.14 She attributed the Chicago and Pittsburgh panels to Apollonio himself and dated them from ca. 1440, whereas she considered those in the Lanckorohski collection to be a product of the painter's workshop, from a later period. Having examined the Lanckorohski panels at the Wawel Castle in 1996, Callmann was inclined to place them among Apollonio's autographs. Some of the panels in question have been mentioned briefly in various publications concerning the painter or the classical tradition in the visual arts.15 Christopher Lloyd recently discussed the Chicago cassone panel in his catalogue of Italian paintings housed in the Art Institute of that city. However, it was beyond the scope of his entry to discuss a number of particular issues connected with the panels in question.16 One of Lloyd's observations related to the question of Apollonio's literary sources is stating that he "could have found someone to translate the Greek for him, since his [Homer's] work was much admired in humanistic circles."17 The present paper seeks to investigate the kind of Homeric text which Apollonio or his adviser could have known, the models for the scenes he depicted, and the context in which his Odyssey panels were produced. Thus, to some degree, this paper is also a contribution to the research on Apollonio di Giovanni's connections with humanism. Gombrich has already approached this topic in an exemplary way in his well-known study on the painter published almost fifty years ago.18 However, he mentions the cassoni in question only in passing. 58</page><page sequence="3">THE "ODYSSEY" CASSONE PANELS FROM THE LANCKORONSKI COLLECTION... 2) Apollonio di Giovanni, ?The Adventures of Ulysses?, cassone front, tempera on panel, Krakow, Royal Wawel Castle. 1. Apollonio di Giovanni and classical subjects Thanks to the research of Stechow, Gombrich and Callmann, Apollonio di Giovanni's uvre is currently quite well-known.19 The painter was educated in the circle of Bartolomeo di Fruosino and Battista di Biagio Sanguini who were mostly miniature painters. In the early 1440s he entered both the Arte dei Medici e degli Speziali and the Compa??a di San Luca. Apollonio's first dated works are miniatures for Petrarch's Trionfi and Dante's Divine Comedy illustrated in 1442 which are preserved in the Biblioteca Laurenziana in Florence (Ms. Med. Pal. 72). Most probably in the later part of his life, possibly shortly before his death, he executed beautiful, but partially incomplete, illustrations in the Virgil codex belonging to the Biblioteca Riccardiana, Florence (Ms. 492).20 From 1446 until 1463 together with Marco del Buono (ca. 1403-ca. 1480) he ran a large workshop specializing mostly in the production of domestic paintings. This fact is known from a document discovered in 1902 by Heinrich Brockhaus among the Carte Strozziane which is generally referred to as the bottega book being a record of commissions placed with the workshop. It was published for the first time by Paul Schubring in 1915 who, however, did not link the name of the painter with the existing paintings, the greater portion of which he himself reproduced.21 The bottega book contains a list of the people for whom Apollonio and his workshop produced some 170 pairs of cassoni and a number of deschi da parto or birth salvers. Notwithstanding, Apollonio di Giovanni was always called a pittore, never forzierinaio (that is, a cassone maker).22 Some fifty of these cassoni or the 3) Apollonio di Giovanni, ?The Adventures of Ulysses?, detail of Fig. 2. panels detached from them, as well as a few deschi da parto (of which only a small number are attributed to Apollonio himself) have come down to this day.23 One is an almost perfectly preserved entire cassone, presently housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, depicting on its front The Conquest of Trebizond by the Turks and executed for the Strozzi family between 1461 and 146524. In the early 1460s the 59</page><page sequence="4">JERZY MIZIOLEK 4) Apollonio di Giovanni, ?The Adventures of Ulysses?, detail of Fig. 1. 5) Apollonio di Giovanni, ?The Adventures of Ulysses?, detail of Fig. 1. workshop also produced a pair of chests for the wedding of Pier Francesco Vettori and Catarina Rucellai. One of them, representing Xerxes's Invasion of Greece, is housed in the Allen Memorial Art Museum at Oberlin, while the second one with the Triumph of the Greeks over the Persians was destroyed during World War II.25 It was these two panels bearing both the bride's and the groom's coats of arms which enabled Stechow to identify them as works by Apollonio and thus begin the recovery of the painter's uvre. Some scholars now believe that a group of the panels once attributed to this painter or his workshop were executed in collaboration with Paolo Uccello or by this artist himself.26 In fact, the landscapes depicted on the Lanckorohski panels, particularly on the second panel [Fig. 3], have much in common with Uccello's rendering of the subject. The striking similarities between the trees and buildings pictured in the artists' work are especially visible in Paolo Uccello's Thebaide housed in the Galleria dell'Accademia, Florence.27 Almost half of the cassone paintings ascribed to Apollonio or to his workshop, both the front panels as well as the side panels (in Italian laterali or fianchi and not testate as they are often referred to) - similarly to the Vettori/Rucellai pieces and those discussed in this paper - depict classical themes taken from mythology or from ancient history. The front panels depict the following subjects: The Judgment of Paris, The Rape of Helen of Troy, Dido and Aeneas, The Story of Camilla, The Rape of the Sabine Women, The Battles of Alexander the Great with Darius, The Continence of Scipio, The Triumph of Julius Caesar. In turn, the laterali, or side-panels, show The Rape of Ganimedes, Hercules and Nessus, Hercules and the Nemean Lion, and Argus and lo.28 It was because of the subject matter (and despite the fact that the style of the paintings is only alTantica to a small degree) that the Florentine poet, Ugolino Verino (1438-1516), called Apollonio di Giovanni the Tuscan Apelles (tuscus Apelles).29 In his first opera po?tica entitled Flametta dating from ca. 1460, Verino said of the painter (without even mentioning Marco del Buono) that: "Once Homer sang of the walls of Apollo's Troy burned on Greek pyres, and again Virgil's great work proclaimed the wiles of the Greeks and the ruins of Troy. But certainly the Tuscan Apelles Apollonius now painted burning Troy better for us."30 Gombrich, who was partly responsible for rediscovering Verino's poem, and who produced an exemplary commentary on it, has shown that the poet was not referring to cassone panels preserved to date and depicting scenes inspired by "Virgil's great work" but to a large tabela picta, which is now lost. The poem, however, enabled him to ascribe several cassone paintings to Apollonio, in particular those inspired by the Aeneid, including those housed in the Yale University Art Gallery. Even if Verino does not mention a tabela picta with the Adventures of Ulysses in his poem expressis verbis, he does refer not only to Virgil but also to Homer. It is probably not by accident that among the numerous cassone panels linked with the workshop of Apollonio di Giovanni the paintings depicting scenes from the Aeneid and the Odyssey are usually attributed to the master himself.31 Gombrich was also of the opinion that with respect to "the scenes from the Aeneid and the Odyssey, the standards of craftsmanship are generally high."32 Even if Apollonio was not the first painter to depict classical subjects on cassoni (as was long but erroneously believed), no one 60</page><page sequence="5">THE "ODYSSEY" CASSONE PANELS FROM THE LANCKORO?SKI COLLECTION... 6) Apollonio di Giovanni, ?The Adventures of Ulysses?, detail of Fig. 2. before him had depicted so many themes of that kind, and no one before him produced such elaborate pictorial narratives inspired by the Odyssey since antiquity.33 One can imagine the amazement of the Florentines living in the mid-15th century when they saw the large cassoni densely covered with scenes depicting the unusual adventures of Odysseus recounted by the mysterious Homer whose epic was known in Florence through a few manuscripts only; even Dante had little to say about him and his poems.34 Apart from the Strozzi and Rucellai families, mentioned above, Apollonio di Giovanni's clients included members of other important Florentine families such as the Medici, Pazzi, Pitti, Rinuccini, Alberti and Albizzi.35 Even Donato Bruni, one of the sons of Leonardo Bruni himself appears in the workshop's list of people who commissioned marriage chests.36 It is known from written sources that Piero de' Pazzi who, in 1452 and 1453, ordered two pairs of wedding chests for his daughters from Apollonio di Giovanni and Marco del Buono's workshop, knew the whole Aeneid by heart, as well as longer passages from Livy's Ab Urbe Condita, and Petrarch's Trionfi.37 However, there is no mention in this period of someone who knew the Odyssey by heart. This would in fact have been rather difficult, since there was no good Latin translation of the poem, and manuscripts of the work were rare. Nevertheless, at that time Homer was no longer an alien spirit. A Florentine patrician Cino Rinuccini in his Invective against certain calumniators of Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio, composed at the latest in 1417, mentions people who "make great debates in front of the populace in the square about whether Homer or Virgil was the great poet."38 7) Apollonio di Giovanni, ?The Adventures of Ulysses?, detail of Fig. 2. 2. Apollonio's Odyssey panels in Krakow and elsewhere The Lanckorohski Odyssey paintings are the only pair of cassone panels with the Adventures of Ulysses that have survived from the 15th century to this day. They provide the most complete depiction of Odysseus's wanderings before the appearance of the monumental mural cycles in the art of the Cinquecento.39 Beside the considerable number of scenes depicted on both panel fronts (twenty-four in all, while fourteen are to be found on the Chicago panel) they comprise only part of the Adventures of Ulysses, recounted in ten of the twenty-four books of the Odyssey. The first panel illustrates events described in books IX, X, and XII and depicts the following scenes [Figs. 4, 5]: Ulysses offering a bowl of wine to Polyphemus (combined with the scene of Polyphemus eating his victims), Ulysses and his companions blinding Polyphe mus, Two Cyclopes peering over the mountain, Ulysses and his companions escaping from the cave of Polyphemus, Mercury warning Ulysses before Circe and giving him the magic plant moly, Ulysses's companions being turned into beasts, Ulysses and Circe, The banquet at Circe's house, Ulysses and his companions fighting with Scylla. The scenes on the second panel [Figs. 6, 7] - based on books XII, V, VI, 61</page><page sequence="6">JERZY MIZIOLEK 8) Apollonio di Giovanni, ?The Adventures of Ulysses?, cassone front, tempera on panel, Chicago, Art Institute. VIII, XVII, XVIII, XIX, and XXII (seven in all) - depict: Ulysses and the Sirens, Mercury and Calypso, Ulysses building his raft, Ulysses and Leucothea (Ino), Ulysses being discovered by Nausicaa, Ulysses and Nausicaa travelling in a carriage, The King Alcinious offering a feast, Ulysses arriving in Ithaca, Ulysses with his dog Argus and the beggar I rus, Penelope weaving, Eurycleia recognizing Ulysses, Ulysses and Tele machus routing the suitors. Thus, as Callmann noted, the painter showed the adventures of Ulysses in the order in which he experienced them and not as recounted by Homer. However, the order of the scenes with the Sirens and Scylla was changed. He placed the latter at the end of the first cassone front [Figs. 5, 20] and the former at the beginning of the second panel [Figs. 6, 21] although they are told in the opposite order. By so doing, the painter or his learned adviser most probably intended to make the first panel more dramatic (the scenes with Polyphemus and Scylla devouring Ulysses' companions) and the second more serene, with a happy ending (the Sirens in the shape of beautiful nude women, Penelope weaving, Eurycleia recogni zing Ulysses). It should also be noted that in the scenes representing Ulysses and Nausicaa, repeated almost exactly on the three panel fronts under discussion [Figs. 3, 8, 9], the painter, contrary to the text, depicted a triumphal parade of Alcinious's daughter with Ulysses in a carriage drawn by a pair of chargers mounted by pages (on the Chicago painting the latter are black), rather than Ulysses's secretive appearance in the palace of the island's ruler (VI, 251-315). It is hard to say whether the cassone front in the Art Institute, Chicago [Fig. 8] originally had a pendant with scenes from the Odyssey, since it depicts a selection of scenes pictured on both the Lanckorohski panels, including those concluding the story. Thus it shows episodes with Polyphe mus, the sorcerer Circe, Leucothea (Ino), the Sirens, the Phaeacians, and those which occured at Ithaca after the return of Ulysses. Due to the lack of space, the scenes on Ogygia, the island of the nymph Calypso, who herself is not shown at all, are combined with the scene depicting Odysseus's meeting with Circe. Next to Odysseus building his raft is the scene with Hermes. Thus the latter scene most probably stands for two appearances of the messenger of the gods: during his visit to Calypso and during his meeting with Ulysses before the adventure with Circe. The Frick Art Museum panel [Fig. 9], which is only partially preserved (the bottom and upper portions were cut off and a small fragment depicting Mercury and Calypso as well as the upper portion of two Sirens is housed in the Fogg Museum, Harvard University), appears to bear the same, only slightly changed, scenes as those pictured on the second of the Lanckorohski panels. Here we can see scenes with Calypso and the Phaeacians, as well as those which took place at Ithaca after the return of Ulysses. The panel apparently lost its pendant, which most probably contained a selection of scenes similar to those on the first of the Lanckorohski paintings [Fig. 1]. The practice of more or less identically repeating the same scenes or even whole compositions on cassone fronts is to be 62</page><page sequence="7">THE "ODYSSEY" CASSONE PANELS FROM THE LANCKORO?SKI COLLECTION... 9) Apollonio di Giovanni, ?The Adventures of Ulysses?, cassone front, tempera on panel, Pittsburgh, The Frick Art Museum. found not only in the uvre of Apollonio but also among the earliest historiated chests, as well as the cassoni produced in the last quarter of the 15th century.40 Despite the differences between the panels in Chicago and Pittsburgh and those in Krakow with regard to colour and the rendering of various scenes, there is no doubt that they are all the product of the same hand; or at least were executed according to the conception of the same artist. To be sure, there was a ready stock of patterns for depicting groups of people, single persons or motifs as well as ships, cities and animals, which were composed in a variety of configura tions.41 However, despite the fact that the paintings in question show a story from remote antiquity, only some of the scenes or motifs are pictured more or less alTantica. Most of the characters are wearing contemporary clothes elaborately ornamented with gold, so clearly belong to the late phase of the Gothic International style.42 Needless to say, at that point it was the style still preferred by even the most distinguished Florentines, as exemplified by, for example the famous frescoes dating from the late 1450s by Benozzo Gozzoli depicting The Journey of the Magi in the Medici Chapel.43 However, there is at least one "Greek" (in fact Byzantine) element also present. In the scenes with Polyphemus and the Sirens (as on the second Lanckorohski panel [Figs. 10, 21]) some of Odysseus's companions are wearing the characteris tic high caps which are to be found on several 15th-century Italian representations of Byzantines. Examples include scenes on Filarete's (Antonio di Pietro Averlino) bronze door at the Vatican, and in the famous frescoes by Piero della Francesca depicting The Story of the Holy Cross in Arezzo.44 In his biography of Pope Eugenius IV (who not only organized the Council in Ferrara/Florence in 1439 which was to bring about the union of Latin and Greek Christianity, but who also commissioned the Vatican's central bronze doors) Vespasiano Bistici says: "I will not pass on without a word of special praise of the Greeks. For the last fifteen hundred years and more they have not altered the style of their dress; their clothes are of the same fashion now as they were in the time indicated. This may be seen in Greece in a place called the fields of Philippi, where were found many records in marble in which may be seen men clothed in the manner still used by the Greeks."45 Thus, Apollonio may well have believed that he had represented Ulysses's companions, and by implication the whole composition, alTantica. In fact he did paint some motives and even scenes in a more or less archaeologically correct fashion, as will be shown soon. Among the most interesting elements of the Odyssey panels, also to be found in other cassone paintings executed by Apollonio and his workshop, are the many inscriptions identifying peoples, islands and cities. Such inscriptions also occur in his Aeneid illuminations and cassone panels.46 The use of such inscriptions is by no means unusual, since even in ancient art similar inscriptions can be found on the numerous representations inspired by Homer's epic.47 Some examples can be found in the small relief tablets known as the "Iliac tablets" or Tabulae Odysseacae48. One of these (housed in the National Museum, Warsaw, and dating from the time of Augustus) depicts Ulysses and Hermes, Ulysses and Circe, Ulysses, Circe and Monstrous Companions [Fig. 11].49 As in the cassoni in question we can see here an episodic treatment of the scenes placed one above the other. In order to facilitate recognition of the main dramatis personae on the cassone fronts housed in Chicago and Pittsburgh the painter or his assistant labelled them with their names written in white. For example, on the former, ULISSE is written seven times, PENELOPE twice, PULIFEMO three times and [ER]ME 63</page><page sequence="8">JERZY MIZIOLEK 10) Apollonio di Giovanni, ?The Adventures of Ulysses?, detail of Fig. 1. (Hermes) and INACO once. In turn, on the first Lanckorohski panel there are only inscriptions bearing the names of two Sicilian cities: SARAGUSA, MES[SIN]A, and the names of three islets north of this island: VULGANO (Vulcani), SIVIGOLI, and LIPABI (Lipari),50 none of which are mentioned in the Odyssey [Fig. 12]. These latter inscriptions figure close to the scene depicting the episode with Scylla, who already in classical antiquity (by Stesichoros and Virgil, and later by Isidorus of Seville and Boccaccio, among others) was located in Sicily at the Straits of Messina.51 The other Lanckorohski panel bears no inscriptions whatsoever. But what can be learnt from the abundance of inscriptions on the panels in Chicago and Pittsburgh and their scarcity on those from the Lanckorohski collection? It could be suggested ***??'&amp;**: -0 - n? 11) Relief with subjects from the Odyssey, marble, beginning of the 1st century A.D., Warsaw, National Museum. :-*?8( 12) Apollonio di Giovanni, ?The Adventures of Ulysses?, detail of Fig. 1. 64</page><page sequence="9">THE "ODYSSEY" CASSONE PANELS FROM THE LANCKORO?SKI COLLECTION... 13) A follower of Apollonio di Giovanni, ?The Adventures of Ulysses?, cassone front, tempera on panel, Florence, Museo Stibbert. that the latter were executed for someone who had a sound knowledge of the Odyssey. On a panel with the Adventures of Ulysses deriving from a cassone front, executed most probably in the late 1460s or 1470s by a not very gifted follower of Apollonio di Giovanni (presently housed in the Museo Stibbert, Florence) the inscriptions identifying the main dramatis personae are again present in abundance [Fig. 13].52 This is the case in another cassone front, previously in the Ashburnham Collection, which is of an almost as poor artistic quality as the previous one and depicts mostly the scenes pictured on the first of the Lanckorohski panels.53 In turn, on a poorly preserved cassone front in the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, which is at times attributed to the Master of the Argonauts and dated ca. 1480, there is not one single inscription.54 In this case, however, the result is that some of the characters and even two entire scenes have remained unidentified. Although one can recognize among them Ulysses's encounter with Circe and the Sirens [Fig. 22c] as well as Ulysses's descent into Hades; the latter scene does not appear on either of the Apollonio panels. It would seem that the Liverpool painting is almost completely independent of Tuscus Apelles's iconography; the best example of which is the scene with the Sirens. It is worth mentioning here one more instance of a subject from Homer's epic depicted in the mid-15th century which can be found on a small informal bronze plaque by Filarete [Fig. 14].55 The relief labelled with the inscription in Greek (ANTINOOS, IROS, ODYSEUS) depicts the fight between 14) Antonio Averlino called Filarete, ?Ulysses and Irus?, bronze relief, ca. 1450, Vienna, Kunsthistorisches Museum. 65</page><page sequence="10">JERZY MIZIOLEK 15 a) Apollonio di Giovanni, ?The Adventures of Ulysses?, detail of Fig. 8. Ulysses and Irus, as recounted in the Odyssey (XVIII, 46-49). On the left we see four suitors; one of them dressed in a tunic and chlamys with a cap on his head must be the Antinous identified by an inscription. To the right is a veiled female figure, presumably Penelope or the nurse Eurycleia. Above, in the vault, hangs Odysseus's famous bow, which the suitors would seek in vain to bend and some other weapons i.e. a quiver, two double-edged axes, a shield depicting Hercules, and a helmet adorned with a relief of a centaur. Compared with several of the Odyssey episodes pictured by Apollonio, this scene (beautifully placed in an entrance hall with a coffered barrel-vaulted ceiling supported by four Corinthian columns) is a very interesting "reconstruction" of a story from antiquity. However, in some of his scenes which are represented in a tapestry-like manner, Apollonio also showed an interesting view of the ancient world as demonstrated below. 3. Creating Homeric Iconography There are no late Antique, medieval or early Renaissance narrative illustrations of the Odyssey analogous to those which exist for the Aeneid before the appearance of Apollonio di Giovanni's paintings.56 Therefore the painter, most probably helped by a humanist adviser, had to create a completely new iconography for Ulysses's adventures. Like the other cassone painters representing secular subjects not previously illustrated, he was forced to adapt the existing compositions or motifs available. Ellen Callmann and Christopher Lloyd have already shown some models used by Apollonio. As Lloyd 15 b) Apollonio di Giovanni, ?The Adventures of Ulysses?, detail of Fig. 2. observed, the standing musician playing a lira da braccio depicted in the scene of Alcinious's feast echoes his counterpart playing a w'e//a in Giotto's fresco of The Feast of Herod in the Peruzzi Chapel at Santa Croce, Florence.57 Callmann, for her part, has convincingly suggested that the seated figure of the nude Ulysses depicted in the scene with Nausicaa [Fig. 15a] was modelled on the representation of the Creation of Adam by Lorenzo Ghiberti in the Porta del Paradiso (the motif most probably deriving from an antique sarcophagus of Adonis).58 However, by representing Odysseus on the Lanckorohski panel as seated, Apollonio introduced an innovation. He is no longer extending his left arm to Nausicaa, but is resting his head on it, thus looking - let us add from our part - very much like a meditating Job [Fig. 15b].59 Callmann also noted that the scene with Leucothea (Ino) rescuing Odysseus recalls another composition depicted on Ghiberti's bronze doors [Fig. 3]. In fact Ino's pose is that of Eve in the scene of her creation, although in reversed position. In turn, the animals shown in the scene with Circe have much in common with the creatures represented in a Florentine engraving ascribed to Baccio Baldini dating from the third quarter of the 15th century [Fig. 16a-b].60 Instead of depicting Odysseus's companions being changed into swine, as recounted by Homer (Odyssey X, 135 ft.) the painter adopted the existing model (in fact the engraving was indeed produced to serve as a pattern plate), despite the fact that it includes 66</page><page sequence="11">THE "ODYSSEY" CASSONE PANELS FROM THE LANCKORO?SKI COLLECTION... 16 a) Apollonio di Giovanni, ?The Adventures of Ulysses?, detail of Fig. 1. both real and fantastic animals, even a dragon. It should be added that in several scenes showing Circe in ancient art, not only are there swine (or men with the heads of these animals) but also lions, dogs, wolves and even horses and sheep. In fact, writers of the Roman period, among them Apollodorus in his Bibliotheca (Epitome Vil, 15)61 and Dio Chrysostom in his Eighth Discourse (On Virtue 21), preserve versions in which some of Ulysses's companions were turned into wolves, lions and asses.62 It is still hard to ascertain whether such ancient representations and the texts of the above mentioned authors were available to Apollonio or his adviser. Now the question arises: what might have been the models for representation of the other scenes or individual characters depicted on the panels in question? Some of the compositions or motifs simply appear to be pure invention of the painter. Consider Polyphemus, who apparently was easy to depict simply as a very large man [Fig. 17]. However, the painter clearly had a problem with representing the Cyclops's countenance; in the scene where he devours his victims Polyphemus has two eyes instead of one. In turn, in the scene in which Odysseus and his companions are escaping from the cave, the Cyclops is grasping a big tree trunk topped with one remaining branch, which is not mentioned in Homer [Figs. 1, 10]. This particular iconographie trait, however, occurs in Virgil in the passage recounting how Aeneas finds one of Odysseus's companions on the Cyclops's island. The 16 b) Baccio Baldini, ?Fighting animals?, engraving, ca. 1460, London, British Museum. 17) Apollonio di Giovanni, ?The Adventures of Ulysses?, detail of Fig. 4. 67</page><page sequence="12">JERZY MIZIOLEK 18 a) Apollonio di Giovanni, ?Hermes warning Ulysses and giving him the plant moly?, detail of the middle portion of the first Lanckorohski cassone panel (as in Fig. 1). passage reads as follows: "His [Polyphemus'] steps are steadied by the lopped-off pine he grips" (Aeneid III, 854). The branch visible on the top of the trunk clearly identifies the tree as a species of pine. In this case the painter also used Virgil's epic, which must have been well known to him since he produced several panels inspired by the Aeneid; besides, opposite to the Odyssey, the Aeneid was easily available in Italian translations63. At the time the Odyssey panels were painted the relationship between Homer and Virgil's epics was of great interest to certain humanists.64 It is perhaps also worth noting that the big tree trunk, on which Polyphemus is leaning, is often to be seen in the hands of Saint Christopho rus, the Christian giant who was very popular in the Italian art of that time.65 One such depiction, attributed to Fra Carnevale, once belonged to the Lanckorohski collection but, unfortu nately, its present whereabouts are unknown.66 18 b) Apollonio di Giovanni, ?Mercury and Calypso?, detail of the left upper portion of the 2nd Lanckorohski cassone panel (as in Fig. 2). The Odyssey panels depict some motifs and even compositions which are truly alTantica, these being clear proof of the painter's efforts to be as "modern" as possible. This aspect of the paintings in question has been almost completely neglected as yet by scholars dealing with the Tuscan Apelles. Such alTantica representations include the images of Mercury, the personifications of the Winds, and, to some degree the depictions of Scylla and the Sirens. Mercury, the messenger of the gods, and in the Odyssey, predominantly the messenger of Athena/Minerva, is depicted twice; first in the scene in which he is warning Odysseus before his meeting with Circe [Figs. 16a, 18a] and then in the one which took place at the island of Calypso [Fig. 18b]. In the former scene the god is handing the plant moly to Ulysses; unfortunately the magic plant is now hardly visible.67 In both cases the god is depicted with winged shoes (talar?a) and a 68</page><page sequence="13">THE "ODYSSEY" CASSONE PANELS FROM THE LANCKORO?SKI COLLECTION... 19 a) ?Hermes and Argus?, from Ovide moralis? en vers, MS fr. 176, end of the 14th century, Geneva, Biblioth?que Publique et Universitaire. 19 c) ?Mercury?, relief from Hellenistic period, Panticapaeum. 19 b) ?Winged Hermes/Mercury?, cassone panel, detail, ca. 1385, Krakow, National Museum, Czartoryski Collection. \.^k= 19 d) ?Mercury?, copy of a drawing made by Ciriacus of Ancona, Oxford, Bodl.

In order to determine how alTantica or "modern" these images are, it is enough to compare them with the late 14th- and early 15th-century depictions of the god among the Ow'de moralis? illustrations [Fig. 19a], in a fragment of a cassone housed in the Czartoryski Collection in Krakow [Fig. 19b], and in a scene on one of the Embriachi caskets.68 In all these instances we see a medieval Mercury with great wings growing from his shoulders, as if he were an angel, and holding in his hand either a simple staff or a wand with two snakes twining around it in a very strange way. As already hinted at by Jean Seznec, Apollonio's panels most probably provide one of the earliest images of a "new" or alTantica Mercury in Renaissance art and could have been patterned on the famous drawing produced by Cyriacus of Ancona (d. 1455) during one of his journeys.69 A copy of his drawing, now preserved in the Bodleian Library, Oxford (ms. Canonicianus lat. misc. 280) executed ca. 1440, depicts the god as shown on a Hellenistic relief which Cyriacus found at Panticapaeum during his voyage to Greece and the Archipelago [Fig. 19c-d].70 It should be noted that in the scene with Calypso, as pictured on the second 20 b) ?Scylla swimming?, drawing , after Greek coins from Cumae.

Later generations of artists followed in the steps of Cyriacus and Apollonio. Another interesting example of this "new" Mercury is to be found in the cassone panels illustrating the Story of Cupid and Psyche by the Master of the Argonauts which are housed in the Bode Museum, Berlin, and date from ca. 1470.71 However, on the cassone with the scenes from the Odyssey, once in the Ashburnham collection, Hermes still has great wings growing from his shoulders, as in medieval art.72 The Scylla depicted on the first Lanckorohski cassone is also to some degree similar to the mythological creature represented in antique art [Fig. 20a]. In the Odyssey she is described thus: "Therein dwells Scylla, yelping terribly. Her voice is indeed but as the voice of a new-born whelp, but she herself is an evil monster, nor would anyone be glad at sight of her, no, not though it were a god that met her. Verily she has twelve feet, all misshapen, and six necks, exceeding long, and on each one an awful head, and therein three rows of teeth, thick and close, and full of black death" (XII, 85-93). A little further on the monster is called "a cureless bane", and finally Homer puts the following words into Odysseus's mouth: "Then verily I forgot the hard command of Circe, whereas she bade me in no wise to arm myself; but when I had put on my glorious armour and grasped in my hand two long spears, I went to the fore-deck of the ship, whence I deemed that Scylla of the rock would first be seen, who was to bring ruin upon my comrades" (XII, 224-226). In the scene in question Ulysses, armed with a long spear, although without his "glorious armour", is indeed fighting with Scylla. However, the upper portion of the sea creature does not look at all like "an evil monster." Her head and breasts are those of a beautiful woman with long, blond hair, but the body recalls that of a lobster or crayfish. Out of her torso grow the heads of six many-toothed dogs while the tail has prongs. Apollonio's Scylla is a strange hybrid who, as in ancient literature and art, has undergone a process of partial idealization involving anthropomorphism and taming. While Homer's Scylla is by no means a half-female, for Virgil she is: "a fair-bosomed maiden down to the waist, below a sea-dragon of monstrous frame with dolphins' tails joined to a belly of sea-green hounds" (Aeneid, 426-431, 435). So, once more Virgil's text most probably helped Apollonio to cope with the problem of Homeric iconography. In the scene in question Scylla's body does not really echo the antique representations, but her head shown in profile with long flowing hair looks almost exactly the same as on some Greek coins and Roman mosaics. The coins struck ca. 440 B.C. in Cumae [Fig. 20b]73 and some twenty years later in Acragas [Fig. 20c] provide particularly interesting 21) Apollonio di Giovanni, ?Ulysses and Sirens?, detail of the left portion of the 2nd Lanckorohski cassone panel (as in Fig. 2). analogies.74 But is it possible that the Tuscus Apelles could have seen them or some other ancient image of Scylla? It is known from written sources that Cyriacus of Ancona was in possession of an engraved antique gem depicting this sea creature, which was so admired by his friends that in the early 1440s he gave lead casts of it to Theodor of Gaza and to Angelo Grassi, Bishop of Ariano.75 Unfortunately there is no precise description of their appearance. It should be remembered that Greek coins were also in circulation not only in the Renaissance period but even in the early Middle Ages.76 Curiously enough an almost archaeologically correct repre sentation of Scylla, quite similar to the one depicted on the 71</page><page sequence="16">JERZY MIZIOLEK Lanckorohski cassone panel, was pictured in the Carolingian period on the vault of the westwork of the church at Corvey.77 George Hanfmann and other scholars have proved that in this case the only model could have been the coin from Acragas. So it is possible that the iconography of Scylla with the countenance of a beautiful woman with flowing hair was also known in 15th-century Florence. Furthermore, when painting his image of Scylla at the Straits of Messina (which is not mentioned by Homer) Apollonio or his learned adviser must have consulted the Aeneid, Isidore of Seville's Ethymologiae, or Boccaccio's Genealog?a. The meaning of the whole scene should perhaps be understood as in Fulgentius's Mythologiae: "Scylla is explained as the symbol of a harlot, because all her lustful groin must be filled with dogs and wolves [...]. Ulysses also sailed harmlessly past her, for wisdom scorns lust; he had a wife called Penelope the chaste, because all chastity is linked with wisdom."78 Scylla's wind-blown hair seems to support such an interpretation because since antiquity such hair has had obvious erotic connotations.79 Calypso, who kept Odysseus as her lover for so long, is also depicted in the same way [Fig. 3]. This gender-conscious reading can perhaps be applied in at least one more case, that of the Sirens. Apollonio's Sirens tempting Ulysses are even more attractive and unusual than his Scylla. They are depicted in the largest scene of all as it fills the whole height of the panel [Fig. 21]. This adventure of Odysseus was one of the most beloved themes in the commentaries of the Church Fathers, both Greek and Latin, and therefore was often recalled by theologians and other writers before the Renaissance period.80 So it is not at all surprising that the subject was often represented by the artists of the Latin Middle Ages. Apollonio's Sirens are shown as beautiful and almost completely naked girls with blond hair and sensual lips, hovering on small clouds on both sides of Ulysses who is tied high up on a mast.81 There are four of them, although Homer mentions only two. The poem reads: "'Come hither, as thou farest, renowned Odysseus, great glory of the Achaeans; stay thy ship that thou mayest listen to the voice of us two. For never yet has any man rowed past this isle in his black ship until he has heard the sweet voice from our lips. Nay, he has joy of it, and goes his way a wiser man. For we know all the toils that in wide Troy the Argives and Trojans endured through the will of the gods, and we know all things that come to pass upon the fruitful earth'. So they spoke, sending forth their beautiful voice, and my heart was fine to listen [...]" (Odyssey, XII, 183-190). In this famous passage the poet mentions no specific aspect of the Sirens' physiognomy that paved the way for countless speculations about their appearance both in antiquity and the Middle Ages. What is greatly surprising on both the Chicago [Fig. 8] and Lanckorohski [Fig. 21] panels, is the fact that the Sirens depicted on them are very different from the ancient half-women and half-birds and from medieval half-women and half-fish with a double or single tail.82 There is an excellent example of the latter type on one of the capitals of the cloister at Monreale [Fig. 22a].83 One might have the impression that it is an illustration of a passage from Guido delle Colonne's famous Historia Destructionis Troiae written in the mid-13th century, being a kind of translation of Benoit de Sainte-Maure's Le roman de Troie, produced almost exactly at the same time as the capital, i.e. in the second half of the 12th century. Guido reads: "Sirens [...] are very great sea monsters, roam the ocean. Above the waist they are feminine shape with the faces of girls, but below the waist they have the appearance of fish. They reveal in singing marvellous voices [...] you would think they surpassed the heavenly harmony".84 Such iconography of Sirens, invented in the early Middle Ages, survived in Italy (also in Florence), to the very end of the 15th century; a case in point being one of the so called Otto Prints (this kind of engraving most probably served as a pattern for the decoration of forzierini, Fig. 22b). The sea creatures on the cassone front with the subjects from the Odyssey belonging to the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool are also depicted in this way [Fig. 22c]85 as are those on Pinturicchio's large fresco (transferred onto canvas) at the National Gallery, London, depicting Penelope at the loom86, which includes some of her husband's adventures. In both cases there are three of them and like the Sirens in the Offo Print, and at Monreale, they hold their tails in a very characteristic way. However, there was a tradition of depicting the Sirens as two or three women (as far as I know, four Sirens are only mentioned by Boccaccio in his Genealog?a),87 and not as half -women and half-fish. There are surviving Etruscan urns of alabaster showing three Sirens as three women seated on the rocks wearing chitons and himations, turned in the direction of Ulysses's ship. Each of them is making music on a different instrument: the first is playing an aulos, the second a syrinx or panpipes and the third a lyre. One such urn, unfortunately partially damaged, is to be found in the National Museum in Warsaw [Fig. 23a]. The three Sirens, this time winged, two of which are playing instruments and one singing, can be seen among the illuminations of the famous book by Herrad of Landsberg entitled Hortus deliciarum [Fig. 23b-c]. However, this time they are partially birds, since they do not have women's feet, as on the Etruscan urns but cluthes (claws). This particular case probably relates to a depiction of what is written in Honorius of Autun's Speculum Ecclesiae, another great 12th century theologian, who mentions that Ulysses's wisdom is an example to be followed as it was because of this that the Sirens 72</page><page sequence="17">THE "ODYSSEY" CASSONE PANELS FROM THE LANCKORO?SKI COLLECTION...

He also refers to the sea-men lured by the music of the Sirens and who were subsequently killed by them. Honorius says: "Once [...] a certain duke, named Ulysses, was constrained to that island [of the Sirens]. He commanded that he should be tied to the mast, but his companions' ears he stopped with wax. Thus they escaped from this peril without hurt, and even drowned the Sirens in the depths. These my beloved, are mystical images, even though they have been conceived by the enemies of Christ. The sea represents this earthly world, which is always being disturbed by the storms of tribulation. The island stands for the pleasures of this world, and the three Sirens who by their sweet music enchant the mariners and lull them to sleep are the three lusts which make the heart of man soft unto evil and lull us into the sleep of death."88 However, beautiful, sensual, and naked Apollonio's Sirens as they are, they should perhaps also be seen as seducing not only with their singing, but with their corporeal beauty too. In his well-known encyclopaedia Li Livres dou Tresor, Brunetto Latini says: "Sirens, the authors say, are of three types. One resembles a woman from the head to the thighs, but from 73</page><page sequence="18">JERZY MIZIOLEK 23 a) ?Ulysses and Sirens?, Etruscan urn of alabaster, 3rd century B.C., from Volterra, Warsaw, National Museum. there down it resembles a fish, and they have wings and nails. The first one sings marvellously well with its voice, the other with a flute and a pipe, and the third with a lyre, and through their sweet song they made the unsuspecting people who were passing over the sea perish. But in truth, the sirens were three prostitutes who tricked all passers-by and brought them to ruin. The story goes that they had wings and nails to signify love, which strikes and flies; and they remain in the water because lust was made of moisture."89 Thus Brunetto's Sirens similarly to those in the Speculum Ecclesiae are half-women and half-birds but first and foremost, although they are less allegorical and more corporeal, they are seducers and this is most probably the way they should be interpreted on Apollonio's cassone panels. Even if it is hard to say whether the painter could have known the Etruscan urns or other ancient depictions of the Sirens in the form of beautiful women there is no doubts that the texts by Guido delle Colonne, Brunetto and the like authors were widely known during the Renaissance period. Apollonio's Sirens may well have been - as Guy de Tervarent once suggested90 - the result of the ambitious interpretation of a highly enigmatic text by Homer and - we should add - descriptions by other ancient (first of all Virgil) and medieval authors. To conclude this part of the paper we should refer briefly to the fact that the personifications of the Winds in the scene depicting The Storm at Sea as shown on the left portion of the 23 b) ?The Sirens Making Music?, in Hortus deliciarum by Herrad of Landsberg. 23 c) ?Ulysses and Sirens?, in Hortus deliciarum by Herrad of Landsberg. 74</page><page sequence="19">THE "ODYSSEY" CASSONE PANELS FROM THE LANCKORO?SKI COLLECTION... 24) Marble sarcophagus with Jonah story, fragment, the end of the 3rd century A.D., Copenhagen, Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek. second Lanckorohski panel are also alTantica to some degree [Figs 6, 21 ].91 They are represented in profile and hold a slender curving or straight horn to blow. They look very much like the representations of the Winds depicted, among others, on an early Christian Jonah sarcophagus executed at the end of the 3rd century, presently kept in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen [Fig. 24]92 and in the Vergilius Romanus of the 5th century housed in the Biblioteca Vaticana.93 However, Apollonio was not the first Renaissance artist to depict such alTantica personifications of the Winds. They were shown in the same way some one hundred years earlier, on Giotto's famous Navicella in Saint Peter's basilica.94 Thus, in the light of the observations presented above, the Lanckorohski Odyssey panels are a fascinating cultural document revealing an early Renaissance view of antiquity. 4. The Odyssey panels in the historical context In his already cited entry concerning the Chicago Odyssey panel Christopher Lloyd wrote the following: "[...] it is likely that Apollonio could have had access to an illustrated manuscript and have found someone to translate the Greek for him, since his work was much admired in humanistic circles."95 However, as it was already said above there is no trace of any illustrated manuscript of the Odyssey. Furthermore the important questions arise: What were Apollonio's literary sources? Would he indeed have looked for someone to translate the Greek for him? And, what was the context of the appearance of a much elaborated Homeric narration on the cassoni in examination? It is hard to remember today that the Odyssey (as with the Iliad) was translated into Latin - thus becoming an important element in Western civilisation - as late as on the eve of the age of the Renaissance. The poem was widely known only from the second half of the 16th century onwards. In antiquity, well-educated Romans read it in Greek (the aforementioned Tabulae Odysseacae were most probably produced for those in the early stages of their education [Fig. 11], while for the Latin-speaking citizens of the Empire it was the Aeneid that played the role of the "national" epic. No doubt the perfect hero of the Romans was not Odysseus but Aeneas. The latter often expresses his hate for Laertes's son, perhaps most strikingly when he recounts the voyage past Ithaca: We fled past the rocks of Ithaca, Laertes' kingdom, And cursed the land that nourished fierce Ulysses (Aeneid III, 272-273). Robert Lamberton observed that the characteristic Virgilian epithets for Ulysses consistently emphasize his deceitfulness, his seductiveness and his gift for manipulation through language (cf. Aeneid, II, 90; II, 164).96 He was, in fact, the key person during the war which brought complete ruin to the famous and proud Troy. After all the small group of its citizens headed by Aeneas was the founder of Roman civilisation. Long before Virgil, the Greek poets themselves asked whether Homer was truthful. Some of them were of the opinion that he was a liar and a cheat, and therefore his favourite hero must also have been a villain. Pindar preferred Ajax to Odysseus as did some Greek playwrghts.97 It was Philostratus, among others, who in his Heroicus made some definitive attacks on Homer's narrative.98 In his opinion, Odysseus's wanderings were pure fables. Why, for example - he asked - would goddesses like Circe and Calypso love a man past the age for amorous delights? However, there had always been several influential voices in favour of Homer and his hero. Aristotle, Cicero and Quintilian, among others, wrote about them almost with admiration99. Besides in late Antiquity very interesting allegorical interpretations of the Odyssey in Greek were produced.100 Also some Latin poets had something beautiful to say and in the like allegorical way. In Claudian's poems Laus Serenae, written ca. 400, the following verses are to be found: "Does old Homer's soaring soul essay aught else throughout his song? Dangers from Charybdis' gulf, from Scylla's dogs, from Circe's cup, the escape of Ulysses from the greed of Antiphate, the passage of the ship between the rocks where sat the Sirens to whose alluring voices the rowers were deaf, the blinding of Cyclops, the desertion of Calypso - all these do but redound to the glory of Penelope, and the whole scene is set to display her chastity 75</page><page sequence="20">JERZY MIZIOLEK alone. Toils by land and sea, ten years of war, ten years of wandering, all do but illustrate the fidelity of a wife"101. However, quite soon Homer and his heroes were to be almost completely forgotten in the Latin Middle Ages and the main sources of knowledge on the Trojan War and Ulysses were brief and rather poor, from the literary point of view, Dares of Phrygia's Excidio Troiae historia and Dictys of Crete's Ephemeridos belli troiani //or/.102 They influenced the ima gination of many writers on the Troy Romance, from Benois de Sainte-Maure and Guido delle Colonne, to the still anonymous author of the Istorietta troiana.^03 In their books, read universally in medieval and Renaissance Europe, Homer is frequently contradicted and Ulysses himself is presented as a second or third rate character, and rather a negative one at that.104 In particular Dares, in his pro-Trojan zeal, was destined, together with the Aeneid, to influence the medieval tradition of Ulysses.105 Dante, the great admirer of Virgil, put Ulysses in one of the circles of the Inferno (Canto XIX and XXVI); however, curiously enough he identified himself with him to some degree.106 At times Ulysses appeared as a worthy example of natural virtue, and not only in the story of the Sirens in which he was seen as a symbol of Christ on the Cross.107 In the Gesta Romanorum - one of the most famous books produced in the 14th century - there is an account of Ulysses detecting Achilles in Scyros.108 In this allegorized story Ulysses stands for Christ. Nevertheless, until the second half of the 14th century Homer and his masterpiece recounting the adventures of Ulysses were names to be rediscovered. However, it was Petrarch who, with some help from Boccaccio instigated the first Latin translation of Homer by Leonzio Pilato.109 In 1360 Petrarch wrote his famous letter to Homer in which he recalls the names of Odysseus and Penelope.110 Although the translation was rather poor it was soon used by Boccaccio in his Genealog?a deorum gentilium. Petrarch's manuscript containing Leonzio's Odyssey with numerous glossae was in turn copied for Coluccio Salutati, a humanist and chancellor of Florence in the years 1375-1406.111 In 1396 in a letter to Jacopo Angeli da Scarperia, then in Constantinople he wrote: "[...] bring as many books as you can [...]. Buy Homer in large letters (grossis litteris) on parchment and a mythographer, if you find one."112 Around 1400 another copy of Leonzio's Odyssey was in the hands of Pala Strozzi, another distinguished Florentine. Leonardo Bruni, Salutati's pupil, translated some parts of the Iliad into Latin.113 In the first half of the 15th century longer or shorter pieces of Homer's epic were produced by Lorenzo Valla, Guarino da Verona, Angelo Decembrio and Vittorino da Feltre; some of them also made interesting comparisons between the Odyssey and the Aene/cf.114 Around 1460 Francesco Griffolini from Arezzo made a complete translation of the Odyssey.115 His version, which is much better than Leonzio's, was also made in prose. In the second quarter of the 15th century Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini, the future Pope Pius II, often refers to Homer in his Storia di due amanti and in De Europa^6 In his De pictura, written in 1435 and one year later translated into Italian, Leone Battista Alberti in advising painters as to what kind of writers they should look for inspiration, also mentions Homer among other ancient authors.117 He expressis verbis refers to Ulysses's meeting with Nausicaa. At the time when Apollonio was producing his narrative paintings, not only the Strozzi but also the Medici kept numerous classics, including Homer's Odyssey, in their well stocked libraries.118 The first Italian translation of Homer's epic appeared only in 1573.119 Thus Apollonio di Giovanni was probably helped greatly by a humanist if he himself did not know Latin well enough. An important role in the diffusion of the Odyssey in Florence and subsequently in the whole of Italy and the rest of Europe, which consequently led to a new and fully positive image of Odysseus, was played by a text as yet unnoticed by students of Apollonio di Giovanni's uvre. I have in mind Basil the Great's letter titled To Young Men, on how they Might Derive Profit from Pagan Literature. It reached Europe at the end of the 14th century and soon after 1400 was translated into Latin by Leonardo Bruni, who dedicated it to Coluccio Salutati.120 Before the mid-15th century the letter was known in Italy in volgare as well.121 The scale of the influence of this text is testified by the fact that more than 400 manuscript copies of it have come down to this day; in the later half of the century it was widely known in the whole of Europe.122 Two fragments of this letter are particularly important for our investigations. The first reads as follows: I myself have heard a man who is clever at understanding a poet's mind, say that all Homer's poetry is an encomium of virtue, and all he wrote, save what is accessory, bears to this and, and not least in those verses in which he has portrayed the leader of the Cephallenians as naked, after being saved from shipwreck, and the princess as having first shown him reverence at the mere sight of him (so far was he from incurring shame through merely being seen naked, since the poet has portrayed him as clothed with virtue in place of garments), and then, furthermore, Odysseus as having been considered worthy of such high honour by the rest of the Phaeacians likewise that, disregarding the luxury in which they lived, they one and all admired and envied the hero, and none of the Phaeacians at the moment would have desired anything else more than to become Odysseus, and that too just saved from a shipwreck. For in these passages, the interpreter of the 76</page><page sequence="21">THE "ODYSSEY" CASSONE PANELS FROM THE LANCKORO?SKI COLLECTION... poet's mind was wont to declare that Homer says in a voice that all but shouts: 'You must give heed unto virtue, O men, which swims forth even with a man who has suffered shipwreck, and, on his coming naked to land, will render him more honoured than the happy Phaeacians.'123 In the other passage one can read: [...] as to the learning to be derived from the poets, that I may begin with them, inasmuch as the subjects they deal with are of every kind, you ought not to give your attention to all they write without exception; but whenever they recount for you the deeds or words of good men, you ought to cherish and emulate these and try to be as far as possible like them; but when they treat of wicked men, you ought to avoid such imitation, stopping your ears no less than Odysseus did, according to what those same poets say, when he avoided the songs of the Sirens.124 Some twenty years after the translation of Basil's text, most probably in 1424, Leonardo Bruni in his letter to Battista Malatesta instructs the educated woman thus: The poets, too, I would have her read and understand. This is a knowledge which all great men have possessed. Aristotle, at least, frequently cites passages of Homer, Hesiod, Pindar, Euripides, and the other poets [...]. The poets have many wise and useful things to say about life and how it should be lived; in them are to be found the principles and causes of nature and birth - the seeds, as it were, of all teachings - by their antiquity and their reputation for wisdom they possess a high authority, by their elegance they have acquired a splendour and a distinction [...]. Does Homer lack any sort of wisdom that we should refuse him the repute of being most wise? Some say that his poetry provides a complete doctrine of life, divided into periods of peace and war. And indeed in the affairs of war, what has he not told us of the prudence of the general, of the cunning and bravery of the soldier, of the kinds of trickery to be allowed or omitted, of advice, of counsel? [...] in no other writers can be found so many examples of womanly modesty and goodness: Penelope's chastity and faithfulness to Ulysses, Alcestis's wonderful modesty towards Admetus, the marvellous constancy of both in the face of calamities and long separation from their husbands. Many such instances can be read in the poets, the finest patterns of the wifely arts.125 Thus, in the mid-15th century the grounds for the appearance of Odysseus in the visual arts as a fully positive character, and as an exemplum virtutis to be followed was well prepared. His astuteness, practical wisdom and wilfulness, and likewise the chastity of his wife Penelope, entered the canon of exempla as did the heroes of Virgil, Livy and Valerius Maximus and among them Aeneas, Dido, Camilla, Lucretia and Virginia.126 5. Some further thoughts on the meaning of the Odyssey panels within the context of the marital bedroom It should be recalled that the majority of cassoni served as marriage chests and played an important part in the so-called domumductio or marriage procession (in which the newly-wed woman was led to her husband's house). Afterwards they were placed in the bedroom, often called the camera mia: that is, the most important room in the house.127 Perhaps it was because of this public show during which the chests were transported through the streets of Florence that they were so lavishly adorned with multicoloured narrative paintings, thus demonstrating not only personal artistic tastes but also refinement. One scholar dealing with domestic painting has even argued that "the wedding chests developed their elaborate decoration as a result of their substitution for a display of the dowry itself."128 Judging from the preserved cassone panels produced in Florence it was very fashionable indeed in the mid-15th century to have marriage chests adorned with subjects inspired by classical authors. The answer to the question: What could have been the message conveyed by the cassone fronts by Apollonio di Giovanni? (which were executed for an unknown Florentine wedding) seems obvious, if only in the light of the previously cited texts. As in ancient times Penelope, who waited loyally for many years for her husband to return, was seen as the ideal of a beautiful and faithful wife (castitas being perhaps the most extolled of the womanly virtues in 15th-century Florence), whereas Odysseus was once again the symbol of wisdom, courage, craftiness and perseverance. Penelope who did not succumb to the wiles of her relentless suitors, and is shown working at her loom [Fig. 25], could be perceived as the supreme symbol of hearth and home. In his Triumphus Pudicitiae Petrarch says: But I will tell of some in the forefront Of truest honour; and among them all Lucretia and Penelope were first, For they had broken all the shafts of Love And torn away the quiver from his side, And they had plucked the feathers from his wings.129 77</page><page sequence="22">JERZY MIZIOLEK 25) ?The Adventures of Ulysses?, right portion of the second Lanckorohski panel (as in Fig. 2). Boccaccio echoes his words somewhat in his Concerning Famous Women: "Penelope [...] wife of Ulysses [...] was a woman of untarnished honour and inviolate chastity, and a holy and eternal example for women."130 And Odysseus not MM *??? tm 26 a) ?Ulysses travelling with Nausicaa on a cart?, detail of the Chicago panel (as in Fig. 8). only defeated Scylla but did not succumb to the Sirens (a symbol of lust) and tried, as fast as he could, to free himself of the unwanted love of the beautiful Calypso and Circe who tempted him with the offer of eternal youth. It should be remembered that some writers interpreted the monster (Scylla) as a harlot and Ulysses as wisdom. Moreover Homer relates how the gods were constantly vigilant of the exemplary couple - they are both put to the test, but fate is kind to them. These qualities and "favours granted by the gods" were very meaningful and precious to the rich merchants who inhabited Florence and travelled throughout Europe and the Levant. Also on the cassoni under discussion there are some motifs relating to pilgrimages: Odysseus returns to his Kingdom with a staff and an even more telling symbol - a mollusc shell in his hat; and thus seems like a veritable medieval or Renaissance pilgrim. His long and perilous journeys had already long been seen as a metaphor of human life, a return to one's home, the search for wisdom and also a journey to the world beyond131. The chests depicting tapestry-like scenes from the Odyssey, placed at the sides of the nuptial bed were to be a daily reminder of the antique ideal of a man and wife and to show, when the occasion arose (i.e. a visit from friends of family) the good breeding and ideals of the owners132. So that the connection between the paintings, and the weddings and the domumductio (or wedding procession) would be totally self-evident Apollonio di Giovanni deviated, as already noted, from one of the scenes in Homer's text. He depicted Odysseus and Nausicaa in a 26 b) ?Ulysses travelling with Nausicaa on a cart?, detail of the middle upper portion of the second Lanckorohski cassone panel (as in Fig. 3). 78</page><page sequence="23">THE "ODYSSEY" CASSONE PANELS FROM THE LANCKORO?SKI COLLECTION... beautiful two wheeled carriage, and not stealing imperceptibly into the palace of the King [Fig. 26a-b]. So they appear, like the newly-wed Theseus and Hippolyta, depicted riding in an equally ornamented carriage on the cassone in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts,133 or like the Queen of Sheba on her way to King Solomon on the cassone in a private collection in Italy.134 It is worth noting that on the panel from the Lanckorohski collection behind the carriage a pair of rabbits is depicted [Fig. 26b]. As it is well-known in the period when the cassoni in question were produced rabbits signified love and fertility135. 6. The Odyssey panels, the last of the Lanckorohskis and the Royal Wawel Castle In conclusion of these observations on the cassoni depicting the most elaborate narration inspired by the Odyssey in the Italian 15th-century art, it is worth briefly mentioning the Lanckorohski family's own "Odyssey" and the "Odyssey" of their art collection. This seems all the more appropriate because Homer occupied an important place in the Lanckoroh ski's residence in Vienna and also because the family became extinct with the death of Professor Karolina Lanckorohska in 2002. She herself was a scholar of the Italian Renaissance art, and it was she who towards the end of her long life donated to the Royal Wawel Castle the part of the collection amassed by her father remaining in her possession.136 The Count Lanckorohski and his collection of Italian paintings Count Karol Lanckorohski (1848-1933), son of Kazimierz Lanckorohski and Leonia (n?e Potocka), was born and educated in Vienna [Fig. 27].137 He was descendant of the family that have played a leading role in Polish history and cultural life for at least seven centuries. Their roots can be traced back to the beginning of the 14th century when they owned extensive demesnes in the former north-eastern part of Poland. Members of the family included hetm?n, senators (of which there were as many as 16 in the course of the family's history) and civil servants who worked in the highest echelons of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Many of them earned a reputation as great patriots and patrons of the arts and culture by supporting, inter alia, the Jagiellonian University, commissioning famous works of arts in Krakow, the former capital of Poland, and for their involvement, in the last quarter of the 18th century, in the Commission for National Education. After the the partitions of Poland at the end of the 18th century, like many of the other aristocratie families in Galicia, the 27) Karol Lanckorohski with his daughter Karolina, ca. 1920, photograph. Lanckorohskis settled in Vienna but they never stopped declaring their Polishness and fought for it persistently. Count Karol Lanckorohski spent his childhood in Paris and then attended both high school and University in Vienna138. In 1870, when barely twenty-two years old he received his doctorate in law. During his studies he also took a keen interest in classical archaeology, history of art and in literatutre. It would seem that Alexander von Warsberg and Wilhelm von 79</page><page sequence="24">JERZY MIZIOLEK Hartel (1839-1905) had much influence on his tastes and interests as a collector, archaeologist and researcher.139 Von Hartel, a distiguished classical philologist (in 1900-1905 the Minister of Culture and Education) was one of Lanckorohski's teachers and, in time, became one of his closest friends, also taking part in the famous archaeological expedition to Asia Minor organised by the Count in the mid-1880s140. The monumental, two-volume publication being the result of the expedition entitled The Towns of Pamphylia and Pisidia, which Lanckorohski dedicated to von Warsberg, the author of the once famous Homerische Landschaften (1884) and Odysseische Landschaften (1887), is a good indication of their friendship.141 The dedication reads: "In memory of Aleksander, the Baron von Warsberg, a much lamented friend and lover of the Antique, dedicated by the author." As a result of his journeys, his likes, his knowledge and financial means, Lanckorohski gathered an enormous number of works of art almost from all the continents142. However, the country he loved and got to know the best was Italy. He visited it countless times, first to become acquainted with its culture and to collect Italian works of art, and then to take part in archaeological excavations and conservation work at the cathedral of Aquileia. In one of his books - entitled Around the World (published in both German and Polish) he writes: "I am happy with the hope of India, I would be happy to travel around the world, but my heart belongs to that strip of land between the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian Seas. With Robert Browning I can say: 'Open my heart and you will see / Engraved inside Italy'"143. The monuments of Italy - architectural works, sculptures and paintings he also praised in verse; the titles of some of these being: Lido, Santa Barbara di Palma il Vecchio, San Francesco in Deserto, Michaelan gelo's Moses .144 At the beginning of the 20th century his collection consisted, among others, of over two hundred Italian paintings and among these more than thirty produced for domestic setting, deriving from cassoni, spalliere, cornici (wainscotting) and lettucci (day-beds). We know quite a bit about the collection from several paintings by Rudolf von Alt and Hans Ludwig Fischer depicting the interiors of Lanckorohski's residences in Vienna and Rozd?t (near Lvov/Lviv) and first and foremost from three publications: a small guide of 1903, Palais Lanckorohski Jacquingasse 78; the Eniges ?ber italienische bemalte Truhen, 1905, referred to above, and the Ausgew?hlte Kunstwerke der Sammlung Lanckorohski, 1918 (being a Festschrift to the Count). A priceless item is a small watercolour by Ludwig Hans Fischer, which recently came to light at a Sotheby's auction [Fig. 28].145 Against a backdrop of furniture and various works of art which cover the walls of the first of the rooms, one of the most famous canvasses of the former Lanckorohski collection - St. George and the Dragon by Paolo Uccello is easly recognizable. Some cassone paintings are visible on the facing wall. One of the photographs taken at the Lanckorohskis residence on the Jacquingasse in Vienna shows the Italian Room of the palace filled with, among other objects, the famous canvas by Dosso Dossi depicting Jupiter Painting Butterflies (since 2002 also housed in the Royal Wawel Castle), a tondo attributed to Botticelli (lost during the World War II), and one of the Odyssey cassone fronts [Fig. 29]. During and after the war perished not only the aforementioned tondo but many more paintings and other objects from the collection. Despite the efforts made by Karol Lanckorohski's heirs to have the collection moved to Poland after his death in 1933, it proved impossible. Apart from Karolina, the other heirs were her brother Antoni and sister Adelajda. When permission was finally received, the World War II broke out and the collection was confiscated by the Nazis in October 1939; Karolina, her brother and sister took on Polish citizenship already in 1918. The inventory made in 1942 numbered 3,559 items.146 In 1942 and 1943 the most valuable works were transported to the salt mines in Alt-Aussee and Immendorf. In 1945 they were found by the US Army and taken to the Collecting Point in Munich; after their identifications they were returned to the owners. All Lanckorohski's art objects which were saved from the conflagrations of war were moved in the late 1940s to a bank in Zurich where they stayed for nearly fifty years. In the course of time, mostly in the 1950s, numerous masterpieces were sold and now they belong to some of the most prestigious collections all over the world. For example, Paolo Uccello's Sf. George and the Dragon as well as Domenichino's famous frescoes from Frascati are to be found in the National Gallery in London.147 Sf. Andrew by Masaccio from the Pisa altarpiece was acquired by the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu.148 In turn, some Greek and Roman sculptures from the Lanckorohski Collection; e.g. a votive relief from the 4th century B.C., as well as a sculpture of a Faun, were acquired for the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.149 Major part of the Collection was thus sold, but the motives for these sales were altruistic and patriotic. After the World War II Karol Lanckoronski's descendants could not accept the Soviet presence in Poland and therefore they lived in exile. Their main aim was to support Polish culture and the humanities abroad. For this purpose, in 1960 the Karol Lanckorohski Fund was created; seven years later it was transformed into the Fundatio Lanckorohski with its seat in Switzerland and London. The great collector, archaeologist is as yet little known outside of Poland. However, some of the art objects which 80</page><page sequence="25">THE "ODYSSEY" CASSONE PANELS FROM THE LANCKORONSKI COLLECTION... 28) Hans Ludwig Fischer, &lt;View of a room in the Lanckorohski residence at Wasagasse, Vienna?, watercolour, whereabouts unknown. 81</page><page sequence="26">JERZY MIZIOLEK 29) ?The Italian Room in the Lanckorohski Palace at Jacquingasse 18?, photograph, beginning of the 20th c. once belonged to his collection still bear the name of their former owner. Such is the case of the excellent neo-Attic relief depicting Athena, now in the Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond,150 and the beautiful Florentine painting from the mid 15th-century with a scene of the Annunciation, bought by the Museum of Fine Arts, San Francisco.151 The first of these is defined as the "Lanckorohski Relief", and the second is called "The Lanckorohski Annunciation", whereas its as yet ano nymous author is known as "The Master of the Lanckorohski Annunciation". Count Lanckorohski and Homer In his Eniges ?ber italienische bemalte Truhen Lanckorohski mentions that one of the cassoni fronts with the scenes from the Odyssey he bought ca. 1890 from the famous Italian collector and art merchant Stefano Bardini, and the second in 1904 in an auction of the Somz?e collection in Brussels.152 Thus, because of Lanckorohski's interest in Homer and cassone paintings both panels, which had been separated for very long time, could be found not only in the same collection but also in the same room [Fig. 30]. There is much to show Lanckorohski's fondness of the Greek epic. His collection contained a bronze bust of the poet which was a copy of the famous portrait from the Hellenistic period and is currently housed in the Wawel Royal Castle [Fig. 30) Both Lanckorohski ?Odyssey? panels on display in one of the rooms of the Wawel Royal Castle, Krakow. 31]. From the Memoirs of Karolina Lanckorohska it is known that her father used to recount the whole of the Iliad ano the Odyssey to his children when they were still very young. So she says about it: "He was afraid of bringing up his own children who were so much younger than he was [...]. But throughout our youth, he did this diligently and rather despotically. I could not yet read when he took me on his knee and told me about the whole of the Trojan War"153. Count Lanckorohski and the Wawel Castle Karol Lanckorohski played an important role in the restoration of the monuments on Krakow's Wawel Hill. During the 19th century many of the buildings had fallen into a state of serious dilapidation, as the Austrians after the partitions of Poland at the end of the 18th century had converted the Castle into a military hospital and the Cathe dral was in a poor state of repair. Work on the Cathedral (which had fortunately remained in the Polish hands) was begun in 1895 and Karol Lanckorohski became a member of the restoration committee. He not only provided financial support but also made sure that the monuments were restored according to their original design. His opinion in this respect was ahead of the times and had a great impact on further restoration work on the Wawel Hill. 82</page><page sequence="27">THE "ODYSSEY" CASSONE PANELS FROM THE LANCKORONSKI COLLECTION... 31) Bronze bust of Homer from the Lanckorohski Collection, Krakow, Royal Wawel Castle. The gift donated by the last in the Lanckorohski line to the Wawel Royal Castle is the real crowning point of the many activities undertaken by Karol Lanckorohski in the last fifty years of his life which led to the conservation and restoration of the monuments on the Wawel Hill. In 1994 Karolina wrote the following about her father: "Together with a group of friends [...] at the beginning of this [20th] century for several years he waged a homeric-like war for the residence of the Jagiellonians to be relinquished from its role as Austrian 32) Stanistaw Tondos, ?Courtyard of the Royal Wawel Castle?, watercolour, Krakow, Royal Wawel Castle. barracks".154 The same year while making the donation in her letter to the President of Poland Lech Wat?sa, Professor Lanckorohska wrote: "The Wawel Castle will receive [...] a number of paintings. Seventy-six of these are Italian, dating from 14th to the 16th century. They come from the country whose architects built the courtyard and the rooms of Wawel Castle" [Fig. 32].155 In a way the presence in the Wawel Royal Castle of the bronze bust of Homer and the Odyssey panels executed by the 83</page><page sequence="28">JERZY MIZIOLEK Florentine artist seems appropriate not only because the Castle was built by Italian architects but also because of some events which occurred there at the turn of the 15th and 16th century. In one of his letters to Ficino, Filippo Buonaccorsi (d. 1496), called Callimachus, who spent in Krakow more than 25 years of his life, wrote: "escaping Charybdis I fell upon Scylla"156. On the occasion of the festivities that accompanied the wedding of Sigismundus I of Poland to Barbara Zapolya of Hungary in 1512, the German humanist Eobanus Hessus was so taken with the choral music that he wrote: "There wasn't not just one Siren singing there, but all of them. If he could have heard them, Ulysses himself would have turned his ship back"157. Three years later, on 2 October 1515, in the Senators' Room of the Castle a play entitled: Ulissis prudentia in adversis (Ulysses's prudence in the face of adversity) was presented158. In turn in the Laurentii Eckii de reipublicae administratione dialogus (Krakow, 1520, k. C3v) one of the interlocutors ridicules the tales of the poets (Homer and his commentators) who recount the story of Circe and how Odysseus's companions were turned into swine. The second interlocutor rebukes him for not understanding the moral behind the tale. The King of Ithaca's companions were turned into swine when they were not being prudent and gave way to animal-like pleasures. In our times also - the second interlocutors concludes - many people turn into donkeys and mules when they do vile things and become entangled in dim-witted stupidity. Thus, from the Homeric "aura" of the Lanckorohski palace in Vienna the Apollonio's Odyssey panels were moved to the Renaissance and somewhat Homeric "aura" of the Wawel Royal Castle. * This paper was written during the tenure of Paul Mellon Visit ing Senior Fellowships in 2001 at the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts (CASVA) at the National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C. and revised in February of 2003 at the Villa I Tatti (Harvard University Center for Italian Renaissance Studies).
