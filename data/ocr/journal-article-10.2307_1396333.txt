<plain_text><page sequence="1">David Novak MORDECAI KAPLAN'S REJECTION OF ELECTION I. A COPERNICAN REVOLUTION? The American Jewish thinker Mordecai M. Kaplan (1881-1983), throughout his exceptionally long and active teaching career, continu- ally asserted that the classical biblical-rabbinic doctrine of election of Is- rael by God is not necessary for the continuity of Judaism. Indeed, he asserted that the retention of this doctrine by modern Jews is detrimen- tal for the continuity of Judaism. His rejection of this doctrine on what he saw as Jewish religious grounds has had an enormous influence on many contemporary Jews, even after his death. Although Kaplan is by no means the only modernJewish thinker to reject the classical doctrine of election, his version of this modernist rejection of it is probably best known. In this paper I shall argue that Kaplan's rejection of the election of Israel is not nearly as original as he and his disciples have maintained, that in fact, it must be seen as just one version of modern Jewish liberal- ism. And, it is not even the most cogent version of it, after all. Neverthe- less, any contemporary attempt to philosophically retrieve the meaning of the classical doctrine, let alone its truth, must deal with Kaplan's posi- tion carefully because of its historical significance. At the end of his career, in his last book especially, Kaplan desig- nated his approach to Judaism, which he had been calling "Reconstruc- tionism" for at least forty years theretofore, a "Copernican revolution." The Reconstructionist version of Judaism as an evolving religious civi- lization initiated a Copernican revolution in the interpretation of the Jewish spiritual heritage. Rejecting the assumption that the Jewish people must be maintained in order that their religion may live, Re- constructionism declares: The Jewish religion must be maintained in order that theJewish people may live.1 The designation of this turn as "Copernican" is a metaphor based on the inversion of Ptolemaic cosmology by Copernicus. Whereas in Ptole- maic cosmology the earth is the center of the planetary system, in ModernJudaism 15 (1995): 1-19 ? 1995 by TheJohns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">David Novak Copernican cosmology it is now the sun that is the center of the plane- tary system. The earth is now nothing more than a medium-sized planet within that larger system. Kaplan was most enthused by the notion of scientific and historical progress.2 His use of the term "Copernican" is a metaphor that con- notes something radically innovative, which is an important claim for a thinker who so emphasizes "creativity" as he does.3 "Copernican" seems to be a symbol for something that has revolutionized earlier tradition, and something that has deflated earlier self-centered naivet6. In the case at hand, Kaplan compares himself to Copernicus by attempting to deflate the naivete of those who still believe in the cosmic centrality of the Jewish people just as Copernicus deflated the naivete of those who still believed in the geocentricity. The pretentiousness of this claim was noted even during Kaplan's lifetime already, however.4 II. KAPLAN'S CIVILIZATION When Mordecai Kaplan and his disciples published a new prayerbook in 1945 in which the classical blessing "who has chosen us from among all peoples" (asher bahar banu mikol ha'amim) was changed to the more vague "who has drawn us to his service" (asher qervanu I'avodato)5-a change not even found in the most radical Reform prayerbooks thereto- fore-considerable protest arose from severalJewish quarters. Many tra- ditionalists were aghast at what seemed to be such a radical departure from traditional liturgical forms.6 Other Jews felt that Kaplan had de- prived the Jewish people of a needed emotional support for their sur- vival (and in 1945 the survival factor certainly had to be predominant). But the only really effective critique would have to be, as we shall soon see, theological. Kaplan's theology does not allow the affirmation of a God who chooses anyone. Hence it would totally disingenuous of Kap- lan to even pay lip service to the classical doctrine. Whatever faults Kap- lan may have had, hypocrisy was not one of them. To the opposition of the traditionalists Kaplan could have an easy progressivist answer: tradition had to be "revaluated" if it was to ad- vance and not deter the intellectual plausibility of Judaism in the mod- ern world. By revaluation, which is central to his whole method, Kaplan means a process whereby the data of tradition are evaluated by present pragmatic criteria and are then selectively recontextualized in order to serve our own ends.7 To the opposition of those who wanted the doc- trine of election to be retained for psychological reasons, Kaplan had an easy psychological answer, explicitly stated already in his 1934 founda- tional work, Judaism as a Civilization, "There are so many other ways of developing a sense of self-respect-ways that look to the future instead 2</page><page sequence="3">Mordecai Kaplan's Rejection of Election of to the past." But Kaplan's answer to a theological critique could not be so simple inasmuch as it calls for a theoretically cogent response, not just for an allusion to what were modernist truisms for Kaplan and many of his contemporaries. Although Kaplan did not begin to pay serious attention to Her- mann Cohen until many years after he concluded Judaism as a Civiliza- tion,9 in that foundational work he had already rejected the liberal Jewish notion that Israel had in truth elected God, to which Cohen gave the most philosophically cogent expression.10 To Kaplan, this notion suggested that Judaism was basically a matter of individual volition. As such, it seemed to eliminate the sense of ethnic continuity he saw at the very heart of any civilization in general, andJudaism in particular. Thus he argues against what he called the "Reformist" view of Jewish survival by pointing out that "The adherent of a philosophy should be free to give it up as soon as he finds it unacceptable, for at no time should the element of constraint be a factor in a loyalty whose chief value depends on its being a matter of choice"" The great innovation of liberal Judaism was to assert that instead of the classical doctrine that God elects Israel, it was more consistent with modernity to assert that it is Israel who elects God. This was a point that liberal Jews accepted from Spinoza, however, insisting against Spinoza that Israel's election of God is still valid.'2 Nevertheless, the point in common between the classical doctrine of election and even the liberal Jewish inversion of it is that the existence of theJewish people is not that of a natural entity. In the classical doctrine, the election of Israel is as unnatural as the act of creation itself: it could have just as easily not taken place. The election of Israel is taken to be God's miraculous in- cursion into the natural world just like creation is God's miraculous founding of the world and its nature. Like all miracles, it can be taken as a reminder to those who would worship nature how contingent its seem- ingly necessary order really is. In this important sense, election is founded on the absolute primacy of the Creator God, the God who transcends his creation but whose creation never transcends him.l3 Even in the liberal inversion of the classical doctrine, where Israel elects God, that election is also not natural. It is the free assent of a commu- nity to approximate, as best it can, the absolute ideal. Kaplan, conversely, does not agree that the foundation of theJewish people and her civilization is volitional, either the volition of God or the volition of humans. As far as human volition is concerned, Kaplan insists that "A civiliza- tion is not a deliberate creation. It is as spontaneous a growth as any living organism ... its existence must be determined by the imperative of a national tradition and the will-to-live as a nation."14 Now the logic of this passage is problematic. And this is but one of many examples of his 3</page><page sequence="4">David Novak rhetoric's terminological imprecision. For we normally connect "will" "deliberation," "creation," and "imperative." That is, one deliberates about what to create and then resolves-wills-to do it. That resolute willing becomes imperative for the one who concludes it; But if, as Kaplan seems to be saying that which is "spontaneous growth" is not deliberate, it would also seem more appropriate to refer to it as an "instinct" or a "drive" or possibly even a "desire" rather than as a "will-to-live." Is not the use of the word "will" inappropriate?15 What Kaplan seems to mean, however, is thatJewish identity and survival are conscious matters need- ing no justification by any end external to themselves. So Kaplan con- cludes by asserting that "With this approach, the question of 'why be a Jew?' loses its relevance. If Jewish life is a unique way of experience, it needs no further justification."'6 A more comprehensive reading of Kaplan's thought indicates that the confusion I have noted in the above passage about the "will-to-live" is more than just terminological. It very much reflects a conceptual con- fusion in his theology as a whole. When we locate and explain this con- fusion we will be better able to see that Kaplan does not reject the liberal notion of election in principle after all, but that he only modifies it ever so slightly. Although he does not mention Darwin in his discussions of Jewish identity and its continuity, being the committed "naturalist" that he was, I cannot help but think that Kaplan must have been aware of what could very well be the Darwinian challenge to his naturalist argument for the unquestioned continuity of Jewish identity.'7 For in Darwin's view, the survival of anything is not taken for granted, but it is, rather, to be "jus- tified" by its adaptation to its larger environment.'8 Here "justification" is not a reasoned appeal to prior principles. It means more simply that any natural organism is contingent on factors greater and more power- ful than itself. However, Darwinism became the basis of a social ideology that did demand that reasons be given why any group or any individual should or should not survive. This type of thinking was employed by a number ofJewish assimilationists. And Kaplan was aware of it (although he associated it with Nietzsche rather than Darwin).19 If so, then how does one answer the claim of assimilationists that the radically changed environment of modernity, a factor that very much predominates in Kap- lan's scale of values, calls for the abandonment of the fossil-like status of Judaism (to use Arnold Toynbee's controversial characterization of Ju- daism),20 especially by those perceptive enough to recognize Nature's normative pull? Since Darwin, no one has been able to automatically equate the naturalness of an organism with its necessary permanence. Certainly, the fact of the widespread abandonment of Judaism by many intelligentJews, some of whom justified their choice by evolution- ary-type reasoning of one sort or another, was well known to Kaplan. De- 4</page><page sequence="5">Mordecai Kaplan's Rejection of Election spite all his talk about folk culture and folk religion, the world in which Kaplan lived and worked was the cosmoplitan world of the twentieth- century metropolis, a world in which personal identities are far more easily chosen than in the premodern Lithuanian shtetl where he was born. Indeed, the growing prevalence of intermarriage between Jews and non-Jews, which today involves at least half of the Jews marrying in the United States, was something that Kaplan had to take note of even in 1934, when it involved far fewerJews.21 As aJewish communal leader, Kaplan was well aware that to predict the survival ofJudaism as a self-evident assertion would be foolhardy, to put it mildly. From his writings, one gets the distinct impression that Kap- lan, like many of his thoughtful contemporaries who chose to remain within Judaism in more than a merely ethnic sense, was genuinely wor- ried throughout his very long career about the survival of Judaism. As he writes quite early inJudaism as a Civilization, "It is by no means a fore- gone conclusion that Judaism in America is destined to live. It all de- pends upon what the Jews of this and the next generation do."22 Indeed, this genuine concern for the future of American Jewry and Judaism made Kaplan a very attractive teacher of rabbinical students at the Jew- ish Theological Seminary of America for at least fifty years. Unlike his more traditionalist colleagues on the faculty, he alone seemed to be grap- pling with the real problems of assimilation and apathy that would soon be facing these soon to be ordained rabbis in their own communities.23 The fact is that Kaplan was not just describing Jewish survival as something simply given, as a social scientist might do; instead, more often than not, he was arguing as an ideologue for the right ofJewish civ- ilization to survive and continue. Thus he proposes the following chal- lenge to his contemporaries: "Jews must therefore find a meaning in their status as a nation, or, failing this, must construct one that will jus- tify the effort and struggle involved in upholding that status."24 If ajusti- fication is required forJewish survival, which must validate its meaning, then by what higher criteria was Kaplan justifying it? The answer to this question lies in a closer view of how Kaplan uses the term "civilization," which is the keystone of his thought. Kaplan speaks of both "civilizations" and "civilization."25 It seems to me that there are three possible ways of constituting the relation between these two terms. Sorting these three ways out will help us to better see by comparsion and contrast the significance of the option Kaplan exercised. On the one hand, we might take the term "civilization" as a hom- onym in the sense that different historical and geographic groupings have nothing essential in common, and that any similarities are superfi- cial if not accidental. Thus, in this view, there are only "civilizations," but there is no "civilization" as an overarching genus of which various "civilizations" are species. This implies the type of radical relativism or 5</page><page sequence="6">David Novak historicism that would require any international cooperation to be based on totally ahistorical criteria that have to be created virtually de novo. Much of post-Enlightenment liberalism operates on this assumption. It assumes the possibility and desirability of a posthistorical society and culture.26 But, of course, it also offers no basis at all for the historical continuity of the Jewish people and their particular civilization. On the other hand, one might take the term "civilizations" as also referring to various historical and geographic groupings, and "civiliza- tion" as a term that refers to certain overlappings between these civiliza- tions. These overlappings are not superficial or accidental. They are the result of commonalities in the way various civilizations constitute the larger world that lies both in their background and on their horizon. Thus, for example, there are overlappings between Judaism and Chris- tianity because each civilization (sticking to Kaplan's terminology) rec- ognizes that it emerged out of a larger created order, and that each will fulfill its destiny in a larger redeemed order. These theological overlap- pings have led to the discovery of the essential character of certain key ethical overlappings between the two traditions as well. These overlap- pings pertain to humankind per se and not just to the members of a covenantal community. At this level, Judaism and Christianity share a number of fundamental norms, and that sharing, that common border, is of essential importance. In our day, when there is unprecedented in- teraction between the two communities in a larger secular society, that normative sharing has great normative potential. Furthermore, the dis- covery of these overlappings has not required that either Judaism or Christianity abandon its singularity.27 Nevertheless, this relation of "civilizations" and "civilization" cannot be applied to Kaplan's thought because the overlapping affirmed in this view is the commonality discovered between revelations. Indeed, the theologians now engaged in developing that commonality are theolo- gians of the revelations affirmed by their own respective communities, and who can also recognize the revelation affirmed by the other com- munity to be genuine, even if never equal to its own. But Kaplan, as he made abundantly clear throughout all his work, did not accept the doc- trine of revelation. He was a naturalist theologian.28 The third way of constituting the relation between "civilizations" and "civilization" is to take "Civilization" as the overarching genus of which various "civilizations" are species. Now this genus can be either ideal or real. If it is ideal, then it functions similarly to the way the Mes- sianic Age functions in the theology of Hermann Cohen.29 That is, one ideally posits a definition of what human community ought to be, and then one judges how much or how little the various human communi- ties actually found in history approximate that ideal. This method of classification is of course morally judgmental; it is ethical sociology if 6</page><page sequence="7">Mordecai Kaplan's Rejection of Election you will inasmuch as it argues for, and does not merely describe, the so- ciological hierarchy. One present community, or civilization, is taken as exemplary, the one that best approximates the ideal community and, therefore, can see itself, and hopefully be seen by others too, as an an- ticipation of the ideal. Unlike a philosophical idealist like Cohen, however, Kaplan is con- vinced that the model for Civilization per se is already to be found; it is real. Secondly, unlike Cohen, Kaplan does not ascribe historical pri- macy to the Jewish people. Instead, his real model for what Civilization both is and ought to expand to be is western civilization as it exists here and now. Thus he maintains that "If he [the Jew] is permeated with the higher ideals that have found expression in western civilization, he is no longer satisfied with aJudaism which merely survives as a vestigal organ in the life of society. He expects it to function normally and healthily as a form of social energy that makes a perceptible contribution to human progress."30 Consequently, Jewish civilization must justify itself by the proges- sivist criteria that have evolved in the civilization of Europe and Amer- ica, and Judaism must thereby function as a subset within this dominant and dominating civilization. The best that Jewish civilization can aspire to is some sort of minority status within the West. Indeed, it should not be forgotten that in 1934 Kaplan was writing in the shadow of the Treaty of Versailles (1919) where the issue of the rights of smaller nations and minority rights of the members of smaller nations within larger states was a major concern.31 And the horizon of this concern was the real and imminent formation of some sort of world polity, made up of par- tially independent national entities. The progress of civilization, which Kaplan with his fellow liberals saw as the movement away from tyranny towards democracy and the rights of individuals, depends on the ex- tension of individual rights to individual collectives and not just to indivi- dual persons. Anything else is "a menace ... to civilization in general."32 By "civilization in general" Kaplan no doubt means post-Enlightenment western civilization, which is both real and progressing towards its ideal- ized and historically attainable future. And even though Kaplan was a Zionist, of the Ahad Ha Am "cultural" variety to be sure, his Zionism plays a secondary role in relation to the primacy of the idea of world democracy. As he puts it, "Even Palestine . . . must be counted on as ul- timately to be included in and subordinated to a World State."33 Kaplan has clearly justified the continued validity of Judaism by re- constructing it to fall into line with the civilization of western liberal democracy, especially the growing cultural and national pluralism in the West that followed after the Treaty of Versailles. So, in what sense has he initiated a "Copernican revolution" that makes Judaism subordinate to the Jewish people rather than what he considers to be the premodern 7</page><page sequence="8">David Novak subordination of the Jewish people to Judaism? Is not his reconstructed Judaism a justification for the continued survival of the Jewish people and not just a description of a given, unjustified fact? We shall quickly discover that although Kaplan is not completely inconsistent, his "Copernican revolution" is little more than a slight adjustment of the modern liberal justification ofJudaism on ethical grounds. Modern Jewish liberalism has largely followed Kant in assuming that the commandments of traditional religions must be explained by either ethical or cultural criteria. Those commandments that pertain to interhuman relationships (what the Rabbis called the realm "between humans") are justified by ethical criteria.34 Those commandments that pertain to the divine-human relationship (what the Rabbis called the realm "between humans and God") are justified by cultural criteria. They are now "rituals," what Spinoza called "ceremonial laws."35 The dif- ference between ethical criteria and cultural criteria is that the former are inter-national and the latter are infra-national. Since modern Jewish liberalism, also largely following Kant, values the universal over the par- ticular, the conclusion is that infra-national cultural criteria must be ul- timately subordinate to and justified by inter-national ethical criteria. Kaplan's view of the commandments of the Torah can be seen as based on this essential liberal distinction. Thus one can see Kaplan's translation of the traditional term mitsvot ("commandments") into the anthropological term "folkways" as based on the liberal reduction of religious cult to social function. As he put it, "The main content of a civ- ilization consists of folk habits and folk sanctions which have the twofold effect of producing likemindedness among those who belong to the same people, and a consciousness of difference from other peoples."36 But all the commandments are not folkways, even for Kaplan. The reduction of the so-called ritual commandments to folkways is very much influenced by Durkheim's reduction of religion to sociologi- cal function. Kaplan was quite explicit in his recognition of this influ- ence.37 However, when it comes to moral precepts, it is equally clear that they are not for the sake of the nation, but they are what includes the na- tion in the higher order of "Civilization," an order that is the ultimate validation of the national civilization's moral claim upon its own cos- mopolitan citizens for continued loyalty and the larger world for toler- ance. Here, of course, Kaplan parts company with the total reduction of religion to what is sociologically immanent, for at the moral level even folk religion requires a validation from an order that transcends it as a universal transcends any of its particulars. In this sense of Torah, then, there is no "Copernican revolution" at all but, rather, the modern lib- eral project of the universal moral justification of any particular reli- gious culture. Indeed, it is this law which is truly "divine;" it is that which civilizes. Thus, for Kaplan, "Civilization" is the greatest human value; it 8</page><page sequence="9">Mordecai Kaplan's Rejection of Election is humanity's greatest ideal. It is the greatest ideal, but one really em- bodied in modern Western civilization, which as we have already discov- ered, enables individual "civilizations" to "civilize" themselves.38 As Kaplan put it with typical conviction, "Once a group has reached the de- gree of collective consciousness when it possesses the will-to-civilize, it has established a right to existence which no one can question any more than one can question the right of a human being to live, once he has come into the world."39 So it seems that Kaplan has done little more than put a slightly more collectivist edge on the moral justification ofJudaism most cogently pro- posed by Hermann Cohen.40 He would obviously include more "cul- tural" content in his reconstructed Judaism than admissable by Cohen's more strictly "religious" criteria; but the difference is one of degree rather than one of kind. Nevertheless, Kaplan was not afraid to even at- tack Ahad Ha Am, the greatest proponent of a modern Jewish culture, for being so obtuse to think that a Jewish culture could be inherently nonreligious in character.41 Hence, even though he seems to totally sub- ordinate the Torah to the needs of Jewish nationalism, that subordina- tion turns out to be only specific. It only applies to what is calledJewish "ceremony" or "ritual." As for Jewish morality, it is to be that which en- ables Jews to "energize the good latent in their consciousness of a com- mon past, and work for collective purposes which are bound to coincide with the common good of the human race as a whole ... [it is] democ- ratic nationalism at its best."42 Were the subordination of Judaism to the Jewish people to also in- clude the moral content of the Torah as well, it would entail an ethno- centrism very foreign to the cosmopolitan character of Kaplan's social thought. I am sure that were Kaplan alive today, he would be horrified at the type of religious nationalism, advocated by some Zionists, that to- tally makes Jewish morality into a means to the end of national self- interest. Democracy was, for Kaplan, the essence of Civilization.43 And democracy requires the affirmation of individual rights and the rights of minorities. But this type of Jewish nationalism is quite explicit in its contempt for democracy, regarding it as foreign to authentic Judaism. III. KAPLAN'S GOD From the period at least as early as the middle 1930s, when he wrote Ju- daism as Civilization, the book he spent the rest of his long career refin- ing and applying, Mordecai Kaplan seemed determined to avoid two theoretical extremes: classical theism and atheism. On the one hand, he was convinced that the classical Jewish (and Christian and Muslim) emphasis on God was an acceptance of the 9</page><page sequence="10">David Novak supernatural. And in the ontology he largely accepted from John Dewey and other "naturalists," Nature is all there is. There is nothing beyond it or prior to it; it includes everything.44 Accordingly, the transcendence of God that the traditional doctrines of creation, revelation, and redemp- tion presuppose can no longer be maintained. This, then, elevates the status of humans since they now only have to confront the silent struc- tures of Nature, which they rationally infer from within the world they experience, rather than by the commandments of God speaking to them from a realm outside the world they experience. And even these natural structures are basically taken as potential for what humans want to do with them, which is an essentially technological approach to na- ture.45 Along these lines, Kaplan speaks of the task of modern Jewish civ- ilization as one that must "revaluate theocentrism in terms of anthropocentrism."46 On the other hand, Kaplan was no doubt aware of the atheistic cri- tique of any theism put forth by Feuerbach, by Marx, and closer to his own time, by Freud. In this critique, "God" is a projection of human de- sires or ideals onto the universe itself; it is an anthropomorphic diver- sion away from the anthropocentric reality in which humans can alone expect to find any fulfillment. Kaplan was well aware'of the fact that if this type of radical elimination of any God-idea were to be accepted by Jews (as it was by many, especially those who in his time became Marx- ists or Freudians), there was no future for Judaism in any historically continuous sense. He insisted that "with the Jewish civilization ... the religious and national sanction coincide."47 One begins to get an adequate understanding of what Kaplan wants to do theologically, when one sees how he argues against the atheism of "psychologists," which no doubt means Freud, especially.48 In answer to the psychological dismissal of all religion as an "illusion," Kaplan rhetor- ically asks, with'emphasis, "why may not the quality of godhood reside in that very reality which serves as a criterion for rejecting as illusions the traditional or conventional ideas of God?"49 Here we see that Kaplan has decided to switch from "God" to "godhood." What is the difference? In the natural world in which Kaplan believes, there seem to be three types of entities: forces, persons, and ideals. Forces are those enti- ties that are neither intelligent nor themselves intelligible. Whatever in- telligibility forces have only comes when they are seen as functions of either persons or ideals. Persons are intelligent; ideals are intelligible. Physical objects are forces that function as usable raw material for persons in their pragmatic activities; their value is thus instrumental (Dewey's preferred term).50 Nonphysical entities are forces that function for ideals; their value is how they relate persons to goals that are spiri- tual rather than just physical.5' Like physical objects their value too is in- strumental; they are only different in their relation to goals that are 10</page><page sequence="11">Mordecai Kaplan's Rejection of Election considered more important than economic ones by Kaplan. (In this sense, he is very anti-Marxist.)52 Kaplan locates the overall goal towards which all humans strive in this world to be "salvation."53 Since it is in this world and not in some mysterious "other" world, it is clearly recogniz- able. It is progress that knows where it is going and wants to be going. To distinguish this realm from the supernatural of premodern religion, Kaplan calls it "supersensible."54 It turns out that for Kaplan, God is the only nonphysical force there is. God's function is God's very definition. "God may therefore be de- fined as the Power that endorses what we believe ought to be, and that guarantees that it will be."55 God's reality is taken in solely functional terms. Thus God is identified "with some aspect of reality, or with reality as a whole viewed from some particular standpoint."56 At the heart of Kaplan's theology is the assumption that God is not a person. In this assumption it would seem that Kaplan has aligned him- self with a major trend in Western ontology. In this trend, which one can see running from Plato to Hermann Cohen, God is not a person because God is Being.57 Since Being is totally self-contained, it cannot partake of such contingencies as possibility, freedom of choice, and purpose. Without these contingencies, however, the category of "per- son" is meaningless. In this ontology, persons are the conscious subjects of becoming, that which-or better, who-strive to be like Being, but are at present separate from Being. In this ontology, then, personhood is a subordinate category; it is a type of becoming. Personhood is clearly be- neath Being, therefore it is beneath God. However, for Kaplan, God is not only not a person, God is essen- tially beneath personhood. Accordingly, God is not the Absolute. For if God is a "power" or force, then God cannot be the Absolute because forces are defined as functions for the sake of that which is ontologically prior to them: either persons or ideals. Instruments are not self- justifying.58 Here we see that Kaplan's idea of God is a radical departure from both western ontology and biblical revelation. For Anselm's desig- nation (but not definition) of God as "that which nothing greater can be conceived," which correctly designates both the God of the philoso- phers and the God of Abraham, Isaac, andJacob, does not apply to what Kaplan terms "God."59 Indeed, in another passage, Kaplan says, "In our idea of God as Helper, we identify those forces in human life and its environment which make for health, happiness and progress as the manifestation of God."60 Of course, Scripture does designate God as "our helper" from time to time, but that is a description of a certain mode of relation with us, a relation in which God is acknowledged as the source of what we value. Just as often, however, God is also designated as "our judge," which means that God is not the instrument of what we value.61 God 11</page><page sequence="12">David Novak might very well be seen as the source of our salvation, but that salvation, especially in rabbinic teaching, is beyond this world and hence beyond our own valuations of what is our true good. It is what "no eye but Yours O' God has seen."62 Unlike Kaplan's theology, in biblical revelation and rabbinic teaching, God evaluates his creatures by his own standards; to evaluate God by our standards is what God reminded Job is absurd.63 A God who can be evaluated by his creatures is no God at all. And yet Kaplan says that "the logic of supernatural revelation is challenged by our sense of values ... human welfare [is] the sole criterion of what is good."64 Kaplan was a rabbi, as were virtually all his disciples. Beginning in the late 1930s, shortly after the publication of Judaism as a Civilization and his most specifically theological work, The Meaning of God in Modern Jewish Religion, Kaplan and his closest disciples began reconstruct- ing (their preferred term) Jewish liturgy so as to put his theology into religious action so to speak. On the whole, the reception of these litur- gical efforts, even on the part of otherwise sympathetic liberal Jews, has never been as widespread or enthusiastic as their acceptance of many of Kaplan's theoretical views. I think this has been due to a recognition that Kaplan's "God" is not the God who can demand worship. Both the Bible and western ontology have so determined our "God-talk" that we can only designate as "God" what is absolute. That is why virtually all contemporary atheism is based on a denial that there is an Absolute at all.65 In essence, Kaplan's "God" is really "a god," one that is a member of a larger class called "godhood." This seems to imply polytheism, for why can there not be more than one member of the class "godhood"? Does not Kaplan himself imply this when he says, "[God's] presence is evi- denced by those qualities [plural] of the human personality and of soci- ety by which the evils of life are overcome"?66 Of course, I am not saying that Kaplan himself was a polytheist. What I am saying, however, is that he has (perhaps not fully realizing it) accepted Plato's way of constitut- ing theology, and Plato was a polytheist. For Plato asserted that the eter- nal forms, by which we classify everything beneath them, are superior to the gods. Hence "godhood" (to theion) is what determines who is and who is not "a god" (theos).67 Similarly, Kaplan states, "In evolving a con- ception of godhood, the Jews have produced standards by which we can determine whether the object of our worship deserves to be called God."68 So Kaplan, however indirectly, follows in the wake of Plato's philosophical reform of Greek theology that elevated general predicates over individual subjects by hypostatizing them as eternal forms in which individual subjects participate and are thus validated.69 Moreover, Plato's "gods" are actually on a higher level than Kaplan's "forces" inasmuch as they are persons (literally, psychai, "souls"), and per- 12</page><page sequence="13">Mordecai Kaplan's Rejection of Election sons are greater than forces.70 Kaplan himself asserts this when he talks about "the dimension of value which differentiates human nature from subhuman nature. Value is a manifestation of self-consciousness."71 By this criterion is not God subhuman? Nowhere, to my knowledge, does Kaplan ever talk about the self-consciousness of God. As for God's "will," which presupposes self-consciousness, one can see Kaplan's rare use of the term as being a habitual rather than an intentional use of a tradi- tional phrase.72 The above discussion indicates the philosophical problems with Kap- lan's idea of God. Theologically, the problem is that it presents a God who only does what we can accept as good within the confines of Na- ture. Thus Kaplan writes, "Nature is infinite chaos, with all its evils for- ever being vaquished by creativity, which is God as infinite goodness ... the power of God is inexhaustible but not infinite."73 Here again, there seems to be an outright contradiction. Is God infinite or not? Kaplan seems to want it both ways. However, what he might well mean by these words is that God's goodness, namely, God's relation to the ultimate ideal of the Good, transcends what God's power can actually accomplish in the natural world.74 Kaplan's God, then, is not al-mighty and, as such, can this God be petitioned in prayer (baqashah) with any integrity?75 Fur- thermore, can one become angry with such a "nice" God who only helps us? And let it be remembered, anger with the seeming cruelty of God is an integral part of covenantal piety.76 The God of Scripture and Jewish tradition is as much feared as loved.77 God is also the "creator of [what we humans experience as] bad" (Isaiah 45:7). That is why the Rabbis de- creed that God is to be praised both for what we experience as bad as well as for what we experience as good.78 In classical Jewish teaching, God transcends both the good and the bad. Compared to this God, Ka- plan's God seems anemic. IV. THE UNACCEPTABILITY OF THE ELECTION OF ISRAEL From all that we have seen in the examination of Kaplan's thought, quot- ing his own words as much as possible, it is not at all surprising that he rejects the idea of election. Although we have seen that on the moral level he is quite close to the liberal Jewish notion of Israel's election of God, when it comes to the traditional doctrine of God's election of Israel, Kaplan is consistently negative. He basically regards the be- lief in divine election as primitive, something that "[t] he ancients ... as a matter of fact [did] choose their gods ... but not being fully aware of this process, they reasoned that the gods had chosen them."79 Indeed, his rejection of election became a leitmotif of his thought. It is probably the first thing about Kaplan that comes to the mind of anyone who 13</page><page sequence="14">David Novak has even read a little of his voluminous opera, or who has even heard about his thought from others. That rejection is both theological and ethical. On theological grounds, he states quite early in Judaism as a Civiliza- tion, "The modern man ... can no longer reconcile himself to the no- tion of any people, or body of believers, constituting a type of society which may be described as belonging to a supernatural order. This is what the doctrine of 'election' has hitherto implied."80 We have seen the vehemence of his rejection of even the suggestion that there is anything beyond Nature, although he does endorse the philosophic view that Na- ture is much more than "the working of blind mechanical forces."81 The universe itself, for Kaplan, is a creative process that transcends its own past. Nevertheless, that transcendence pushes from within, but it is not pulled from without by what is always beyond it.82 On ethical grounds, he states in his first book, "When the Jews af- firmed that they were God's chosen nation, their claim was tantamount to the assertion that they alone constituted a nation."83 However, he in- sists that this claim is immoral inasmuch as it seems to dehumanize the non-Jewish nations, making the difference between them and the Jews one of kind. For Kaplan, and here he is very much in line with other modern liberal Jewish thinkers, any difference between the Jewish peo- ple and other peoples is at best one of degree. Thus he writes in his last book, The Religion of Ethical Nationhood: Judaism's Contribution to World Peace, "American Jews who substitute the concept of exemplary people for the supernaturalist version of chosen people should strive to exem- plify the ideals and practices of ethical peoplehood."84 On this note, for all intents and purposes, Mordecai Kaplan closed his theological career much as he began it. In 1984, shortly after Kaplan's death, at a memorial gathering for him, Ira Eisenstein, his son-in-law and closest disciple, quoted a passage that I had written that very year about the centrality of the doctrine of election in Judaism. Referring to Kaplan's "Copernican revolution" (which we have seen was neither "Copernican" nor a "revolution") as the antithesis of my traditionalist views, Eisenstein stated, "It is difficult to answer Rabbi Novak, unless one is prepared to tackle, with courage and vision, the full implications of the revolution."85 Eisenstein and I would agree, then, that my views and Kaplan's are theologically opposite. I must also admit that my first reflections on the centrality and meaning of election were awakened by what I felt was Kap- lan's fundamental distortion of what Judaism is and should be. In the intellectual milieu of my adolescence, Kaplan's views were seen as theo- logically radical and philosophically original, even by his opponents. That they are theologically radical is true, and this certainly explains the passion with which Kaplan was attacked byJewish traditionalists. Subse- 14</page><page sequence="15">Mordecai Kaplan's Rejection of Election quent research has taught me, however, that his views are not very philo- sophically original, but rather eclecticly derivative from thinkers much more profound and original than Kaplan ever was. And Kaplan's use of these more original views was mostly rhetorical rather than analytic, which makes a philosophic critique of him often quite frustrating.86 But because of Kaplan's influence on Jews, no contemporary Jewish discus- sion of election can allow itself to ignore him. Philosophical retrieval of the classical doctrine of the election of Israel can only be situated in the present, which Kaplan for good or for ill did strongly influence.

See, e.g., Kaplan's Judaism as a Civilization [hereafter JC] (New York, 1934), p. 83. What is most exasperating about Kaplan's thought to many contem- porary Jews is that the event of the Holocaust, which so altered Jewish life and Western civilization, seems to have made no dent at all in his optimistic progres- sivism. See, e.g., REN, 106. Is there not something obtusely dogmatic about a Jewish thinker whose rhetoric in 1970 is no different from his rhetoric in 1934? This factor, more than any other, made Kaplan's thought of less and less interest to theologically interested Jews after World War II. 3. SeeJC, pp. 511ff. 4. For a philosophically astute critique of Kaplan by a liberalJewish thinker, see Jacob B. Agus, Modern Philosophies ofJudaism (New York, 1941), pp. 298ff.

Kaplan and Jewish Liturgy" in Mordecai M. Kaplan: An Evaluation, ed. I. Eisenstein and E. Kohn (New York, 1952), p. 211. 7. SeeJC, pp. 397ff. Kaplan himself defines it as follows in his second book, The Meaning of God in Modern Jewish Religion [hereafter MG] (New York, 1937) p. 6: "Revaluation consists in disengaging from the traditional context those elements in it which answer permanent postulates of human nature, and in integrating them into our own ideology ... the rest may be relegated to archaeology." Of course, any theol- ogy is a normative reinterpretation of the tradition in the light of present needs. It is not conceived sub specie aeternitatis. Nevertheless, traditionalists insist that the criteria of reinterpretation are to be found within the tradition itself, rather than being imposed on it from without. See D.

For Kaplan's monograph on Cohen, see The Purpose and Meaning of Jewish Existence (Philadelphia, 1964). This monograph, actually written in the 1940s, is in essence a comparison of Cohen's views with his own. It is not, however, a crit- ical engagement of Cohen's thought at its philosophical roots. 10.

The specific critique is of Kaufmann Kohler's Jewish Theology (New York, 1918), p. 6. Kohler (d. 1924), who was the intellectual leader of American Reform Judaism, wrote a more popular version of the liberal Jewish theology to which Hermann Cohen gave the most profound philosophical ex- pression. Kaplan knew Kohler's thought long before he knew Cohen's. 12.

See JC, p. 50 where Kaplan sees the givenness of Jewish social cohesion, which needs no theological foundation, to be located in Jews' "emotional resis- tance to marriage between Jews and Gentiles." But cf. ibid., p. 419 where Kaplan advocates "a policy which does not decry marriages of Jews with Gentiles, pro- vided the homes they are to establish areJewish." This latter passage is more pre- scient of the current Jewish situation than the former one. Moreover, how can one insist on the establishment of "aJewish home" without overtly proselytizing the non-Jewish spouse? Nevertheless, proselytizing is hardly part ofJewish tradi- tion, at least for the past 2,000 years, and it is hardly consistent with the "folk re- ligion" Kaplan advocated. 22. JC, p. 81. But earlier, on p. 48, Kaplan states that "the chances ofJudaism surviving in America are augmented by the very increase in the Jewish popula- tion." This statement is an argument from ethnic givenness. The later statement on p. 81 has proven to be much more prescient. Jewish population in America is on the decline due to a low birthrate and a high assimilation rate. 23. See M. J. Cohen, "Mordecai M. Kaplan as Teacher" in Mordecai M.

Kaplan sees the role of Jewish civilization to be that of "carr[ying] common values to pragmatic conclusions never dreamt of by other peoples" (ibid., p. 256). Jewish civilization, then, is a means to a pragmatic end already envalued by Western civilization. Its task is thus more modest than the messianic one given to Judaism by Cohen. 31. SeeJC, pp. 236ff.

See also TheFuture of theAmericanJew (New York, 1948), pp. 182ff. 56. JC, p. 393. The latter option, viz., God is "reality as a whole," seems to at least suggest that God just might be not only greater than any particular aspect 17</page><page sequence="18">David Novak of reality, but that God might be greater than even the sum of all the particulars of reality. As such, God would be more than just our experience of God's imma- nent function for us. Kaplan does admit in MG (p. 20) that "We cannot expect to understand the nature of God." However, he never, to my knowledge, returns to this very transcendent admission. 57. See Religion of Reason Out of the Sources ofJudaism, p. 59ff. 58. See Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, 1096a8. 59.

See Raphael Demos, The Philosophy of Plato (New York, 1939), pp. 113-114. Re Kaplan's affinities to polytheism, see Berkovits, Major Themes in Modern Philosophies ofJudaism, p. 176. This was also brought out by one of Kaplan's clos- est and most gifted disciples, Milton Steinberg (d. 1950), who towards the end of his life began to have serious doubts about Kaplan's theology. See Simon Noveck, Milton Steinberg: Portrait of a Rabbi (New York, 1978), p. 260. 68. MG, p. 303. 69. This tendency of Kaplan's thought has been developed by his disciple Harold M. Schulweis in his Evil and the Morality of God (Cincinnati, 1984), pp. 122ff. 70. See D. Novak, Suicide and Morality (New York, 1975), pp. 32ff. 71. REN, p. 79. 72. Thus in MG (p. 161), Kaplan defines the will of God as "the complex of forces which impel men to think in terms of ideals and to seek to implement their ideals through laws." Here we see three elements: (1) forces, (2) men, and (3) ideals. Following Kaplan's own functional criteria, one could see will as me- diating between forces and ideals. But this function could only be that of men. For when Kaplan states on the same page, "we cannot see the will of God in any one specific code of laws," is he not inferring what God does not do from what in- deed men do, viz., legislate based on their ideals? 73. REN, p. 51. 74. For if "there is only one universe within which both man and God exist" (JC, p. 316), and if "the structure of the world" has "rationality" (ibid., p. 310), then that rational structure limits God as much as it limits man. Actually, it limits God even more than man because "the essence of personality is to transcend itself" (REN, p. 89) and only man is a person for Kaplan. 75. This "limited God" was given its most popular expression by Kaplan's dis- ciple Harold S. Kushner in his bestselling book, When Bad Things Happen to Good People (New York, 1981), esp., chaps. 7-8. 76. See, e.g., Lam. 2:lff.; B. Gittin 56b re Exod. 15:11; Menahot 29b. 18</page><page sequence="19">Mordecai Kaplan's Rejection of Election 77. See B. Berakhot 33b re Deut. 10:12 and Isa. 33:6; also Y. Berakhot 9.7/14b. 78. Mishnah: Berakhot 9.5 re Deut. 6:5. 79. JC, p. 257. However, it can be argued that the relationship between God and Israel is uniquely one of election, and that the other ancient peoples were related to their gods by some sort of natural necessity. See Kaufmann, The Relig- ion of Israel, p. 298. 80. JC, p. 43. 81. JC, p. 315. 82. See JC, p. 401 where Kaplan defines God as "the creative principle of the universe." Some have seen the influence of A. N. Whitehead on Kaplan's notion of creativity. That may be true, but it is hard to pinpoint since Kaplan's thought is so randomly eclectic. Cf. Process and Reality (New York, 1929), pt. 5, chap. 2. 83. JC, pp. 255-256. See ibid., 348 where Kaplan warns of the danger of "folk religion" being prone to "its apotheosis into a consecrated chauvinism." On ibid., p. 147 he speaks of "the mystic apotheosis of Israel in rabbinic writings." 84. REN, p. 154. 85. Proceedings of the Rabbinical Assembly, Vol. 46 (1984) p. 56.
