<plain_text><page sequence="1">IRISH ARTS REVIEW THE 'BUDDHA BUCKET' FROM THE OSEBERG FIND Of the great quantity of Irish metal work recovered from Viking tombs in Norway, one of the most intriguing finds is the so-called 'Buddha Bucket'. It comes from what is probably the finest re maining tomb, the great ship burial of Oseberg which dates from the ninth century. Its name is derived from the pair of cross-legged or 'Buddhist' schematic figures which form the mounts or 'ears' to its handle. It undoubtedly represents loot, as .do the other antiquities found, being mostly plunder from the raids on Irish monasteries which began in the late eighth century. Many of these raids were launched from the fjords of west Norway, and, of all the Scandinavian countries, it was probably Norway which had the closest connections with Ireland during the Viking period. Irish craftsmanship seems to have been highly prized, and Viking tombs have yielded many important and valuable ex amples of Irish metal-work, including the only known eighth-century crozier.' By far the largest group of items recovered are personal ornaments, mainly mount ings of varous shapes and sizes, detached from saints' shrines or holy books, and then refashioned into brooches.2 Used in addition to the twin-tortoise type of brooch, they completed the full set of dress ornament in Viking Norway.3 The Oseberg bucket belongs to the second largest' group recovered-bronze vessels.4 It is notable that it was dis covered within a great tomb, like the Miklebostad hanging bowl, which is decorated with very similar escutcheons very similar to those on the bucket, was also found in an aristocratic tomb. The Viking dead were furnished with every possible requirement and luxury for their journey into the next life, from jewellery to domestic vessels. That this journey was envisaged as a voyage is evid ent from the widespread practice of ship burial, reflecting the enormous import ance of seafaring in that society. This custom, and the grand scale of burial, was unparalleled in the rest of Europe at the time, least of all in Ireland, since the Irish, being Christian, did not, as a general rule, bury precious objects with their dead.5 The Oseberg Find is the epitome of a Viking ship burial from the highest stratum of society, and perhaps the most valuable and lavish of all Viking Age discoveries. The 'Buddha Bucket', one of a vast array of grave goods, was found Margaret Mac Namidhe is a graduate of the National College of Art and Design, where she now lectures. During 1988 she attended a course on Art in Norway and here discusses some Irish art objects of the early Christian period.

The bucket is in the same remarkable state of preservation as the rest of the find, which takes the name Oseberg from the farm in Vestfold, on the western side of the Oslo fjord, where it was excavated in 1904. The exceptional 'blue clay' of the subsoil of this area preserved the cont ents of the burial mound intact for cent uries, although it was plundered in the early medieval period. Probably because it is a domestic object, albeit a highly refined one that shows no evidence of use, the bucket was one of the few items of metal-work that escaped the attent ions of the grave robbers.7 The chief glory of the find is the magnificent wood carving which is seen not only on the ship itself, but on most of the other im potn_bet_nldigacr,segs sleighdshaft andkst,vrangvew, arniemal-head posts. There is a variety of different styles but animal motifs predominate, from the frieze of gripping beasts on the prow and stern posts, which rise majestically above the body of the ship, to the fabulous in terlaced creatures of the animal-head posts which, with their curved necks, bared teeth and predatory expressions, may have served some ritual or ceremon ial function.8 The small squat geometric escutch eons, with their impassive expressions, on the otherwise unadorned pail, could not be in greater contrast to objects such as these. Made of yew, and encircled by three equidistant bronze hoops, the bucket measures thirty-six centimetres high, thirty-two centimetres in diameter, at the bottom, and twenty-six at the rim. The bodies of the escutcheons are embedded between the first bronze band and the rim, with the handle attached to the back of the protruding heads. Thus they appear as integral, functional parts of the vessel rather than as purely decorative fixtures, and their square and compact shape complements its sturdy character. Beautifully cast in bronze, in high relief, the head is flat topped, lined by semi-circular grooves radiating from a small indentation in the middle of the forehead and divided by a central line. Huge oval eyes, convex and blank, dominate the clean-shaven face, em phasized by jutting brows joining the long narrow nose. A down-turned seg ment defines the mouth, and the cheeks are rather Slavic, high, wide and well modelled. The body combines four in terlocking compartments of red and yellow champleve enamel in T-shaped cells, with a central Greek cross of blue and white millefiori. Long schematic arms flank the body, with small knobs for 'shoulders' ending in diminutive hands grasping the clasped feet. The equally diminutive legs are bent sharply at the knees and crossed again in the middle. The bucket's popular name results from this yoga-like posture and from the in scrutable mask-like face and frozen, stylized appearance. Any suggestion of actual Oriental or eastern influence would be misleading as it is undoubtedly of Irish provenance. Nevertheless, it dis plays a curious blend of different features which derive from both Christian and Celtic sources. The schematic figure style and enamel technique are characteristic of the early Christian period, but are -77</page><page sequence="2">IRISH ARTS REVIEW THE 'BUDDHA BUCKET' FROM THE OSEBERG FIND usually found in ecclesiastical contexts. The cross-legged posture, on the other hand, probably stems from a Celtic cult, one that was particularly potent and liable to incur ecclesiastical disapproval in the Christian period. It is this strange mixture of contrasting elements, the per sistence of an ancient pagan feature along with the emergence of an early Christian style, that is, perhaps, the most fascinating aspect of the figure. The 'family' of bronze vessels to which the Oseberg bucket belongs also includes, hanging bowls, cauldrons and handled saucepans, with buckets the smallest section and hanging bowls the largest. The bronze used contains a high propor tion of tin, a fine alloy not found in native Norwegian bronzes. The yew of the bucket is also found in the caskets of the small house-shaped shrines, such as the one at Melhus.9 Many of the other vessels are also decorated, particularly the hanging bowls, usually on the es cutcheons, but sometimes on the base and rim as well. The escutcheons on that vessel are partly anthropomorphic: two human masks arranged on either side of an enamelled square. There are also three human-shaped escutcheons on a hang ing bowl discovered in the river Maas in Holland, probably brought there by the Vikings. 10 The bowl is complete, of the same shape as the Miklebostad bowl, but badly wbrn. There is no evidence of millefiori and the red and yellow enamel arranged in small squares has changed colour, due to oxidation. Although ex tremely weathered, the modelling of the head is clearly very different to and much smaller than the Norwegian escutch eons. The lowest compartment contains a simple X-shaped design, which Francoise Henry describes as a conventional rendering of crossed legs, but it is much coarser than the finely articulated hands and legs of the Oseberg escutcheon and cannot compare with it technically." Although the sequence and dating of Irish metal-work of the seventh, eighth and ninth centuries is difficult, with little information remaining about the organ ization and distribution of the craft, the quality of the enamelling on the Oseberg figure indicates a late seventh century date. 12 The distinctive use of poly chrome champleve and millefiori, bound ed by thin lines of bronze in a striking geometric pattern, reflects the experi mentation and development of this Figure of St. Matthew from the Book of Durrow, Vellum, from around the mid seventh century.

Red, the easiest colour to produce even under primitive conditions, is also the first col our to be used first when champleve was introduced by the La Tene Celts around the first century A.D. While there is evidence for the production of millefiori in Ireland from the fifth century, it was probably introduced from the Con tinent.'3 This style, broadly speaking, replaced the older spiral and triskel patt erns. The mix of millefiori floating in red enamel (such as the enamel inlay on the Melhus shrine or the beautiful disc on the bottom of the Miklebostad bowl) disappeared, as did reserved spaces of bronze. This development may be due to a number of factors, for example, the demands of the panels of millefiori, which require a square or rectangular frame; or through the influence of cloisonne work in Anglo Saxon jewellery, and the geometric patterns in late Romano British mosaic pavements.'4 The escutcheons on the Miklebostad hanging bowl are so similar to those on the Oseberg bucket that the same factory may have been responsible for both. This bowl was found containing cremated bones, mingled with charcoal, in a specially protected artificial hollow in the large ship burial of a chieftain in western Norway. There are three es cutcheons altogether on the rim. They are functional, attaching the vessel to the chains from which it was once presumably suspended, although no hanging bowl has ever been found com plete with chains. This late version of a hanging bowl, of the type found in Vik ing tombs, was probably originally an ecclesiastical vessel, either a reflecting bowl for a sanctuary lamp'5 or a con tainer for church water.'6 The head of the escutcheon is more domed and oval, and larger in proportion to the body than the Oseberg figure, but has the same arrangement of facial features with the addition of what appears to be a stylized beard. Bereft of arms and lacking the cross-legged posture, the body is more abbreviated, with simple legs and out turned feet, and the enamelling is more elaborate. Green is used in addition to red and yellow, and the Greek cross is formed of four compartments of L shaped cells of enamel with a central panel of enamel and millefiori, with four chequered corners. -79</page><page sequence="4">IRISH ARTS REVIEW THE 'BUDDHA BUCKET' FROM THE OSEBERG FIND The manuscript version of this style is found in the St. Matthew figure from the Book of Durrow, from about the same period. His splendid chequered cloak, combining red and yellow and quasi millefiori squares in a chess-board effect, shows the obvious influence of the enamel style. The figure is again schematic, again lacking arms, and with short legs protruding beneath the cloak, and feet turning to the right. The head is more in proportion, more rounded, sink ing into the shoulders but with the same impassive expression. The medium allows for more detail and he has been given a beard, (a herring-bone pattern from chin to ears), and hair arranged in a distinctive wig-like tonsure parted in the middle. Without the embellishment of colour or pattern available to the scribe or the metal-worker, the most radically abstracted version of the figure style appears in stone. Carved in unyielding granite, the Apostles on the base of the High Cross of Moone in Co. Kildare are reduced to large pear-shaped heads with huge round eyes and long nar row noses, dominating small, square, block-like bodies and simple out-turned legs and feet. Arranged in three groups of four, their collective impact is forceful in its simplicity and repetition.'7 Although stylistically part of the same Cernunnos, lower panel, south face of the North Cross, Clonmacnoise, Co. Offaly. possibly of the eighth century. Courtesy Office of Public Works, Dublin. 'family' of figures discussed above, the Oseberg escutcheon is remarkable for the position of the legs. The most likely ex planation of this posture is that it derives from the important Celtic deity, Cer nunnos, who was usually depicted squat ting, and whose widespread and complex cult was second only in importance to the great cult of the head. His cross-legged position was probably based on the typical sitting position of the Celts as a whole. According to classical writers, they did not use chairs but preferred to squat on the ground. The name 'Cernun nos' is known from a fragmentary relief from Gaul, whence his cult, with roots as far back as the Bronze Age and proto Celtic period, probably spread. He was particularly associated with fertility, both animal and human; and so his cult, subject to regional variation, was parti cularly potent."8 Probably the most magnificent repre sentation of Cernunnos is found, appro priately enough, in metal-work, on a great Celtic vessel, the silver cauldron of Gundestrup in Denmark, dating from the late second century or early first cent ury B.C.'9 The god is depicted at his most regal and powerful, complete with all his attributes. He sits, cross-legged as 'Lord of the Animals', with ascendancy over the various creatures which sur round him, most notably the stag, his cult animal, who has identical antlers. A torc, symbol of divinity, is around his neck; he holds another in his right hand and grasps a ram-headed serpent in his left. The face of the Gundestrup Cernun nos shares the same inscrutable intensity of the Oseberg figure, and the emphatic Cernunnos as 'Lord of the Animals', plate from the Gundestrup Cauldron, great silver bowl, from the late second or early first century B.C.

As a late manifestation of a squatting figure originating in Ireland, moreover one in metal-work, the Oseberg escutch eon is extremely unusual. Cernunnos, or Cernunnos-type figures, became par ticularly potent symbols in the Christian period. In addition to the antiquity of the cult and its association with fertility, the figure and attributes of the god himself were transformed. Cernunnos, so splen didly depicted on the Gundestrup Cauldron, became debased into the squatting, horned, ram-headed, serpent bearing figure of Satan. In Ireland, a scat tered collection of images of this type have escaped the vicissitudes of time but, unlike the metal-work version in exile, they all seem to be carved in stone. A stone figure from Boa Island, Lough Erne, in Fermanagh, which was part of a particularly active cult region in pre Christian times, has a large pear-shaped head, janiform in this case, with diminutive legs crossed underneath a small body. The evidence from the Christian period includes a horned figure carved on one of the pillars accom panying the Carndonagh Cross in Donegal. Although badly worn it ap pears to be cross-legged and may be clasp ing its knees. Also of note is an upright, but antlered, figure flanked by wolves, 'Lord of the Animals', on the north shaft of the Market Cross of Kells. Of par ticular relevance to the Oseberg figure is The Twelve Apostles, detail of base of the high Cross of Moone, Co. Kildare, possibly of the ninth century.

Although Carola Hicks has disagreed with Anne Ross's identificat ion of this figure as Cernunnos,20 it adopts an unmistakeable position, evi dent despite the elaborate and now rather weathered interlace entwining the body. The legs are bent sharply at the knees and crossed again in the middle, exactly the same arrangement as on the escutcheon. In the wide oval eyes, there is also a certain facial resemblance. Fragmentary and elusive though they are, these scattered and varied images show that a deeply rooted and ancient pagan concept persisted, leaving indelib le traces in the Christian period. The Oseberg figures belong to this sparse evidence but are also, as apparently the only extant examples in metal-work, remarkable and rare specimens. While they derive their ancestry from Celtic roots, they belong stylistically to a family of figures from the early Christian period. The squat, schematic shape and bold, geometric enamel-work are char acteristic of the late seventh century, typical of the emerging stage before the full development of the mature early Christian style that was to dominate the eighth century. As a product of this period, the 'Buddha Bucket' is indeed an intriguing object with perhaps a unique variety of features. The escutcheons on its rim display an early style, usually found in an ecclesiastical setting, but here show a squatting posture associated with a particularly potent Celtic deity, now surrounded by the fierce animal or nament of the magnificent carved ob jects of the great Oseberg Find.
