<plain_text><page sequence="1">Folklore vol. 100:ii, 1989 221 Witchcraft in the Central Balkans II: Protection against Witches T. P. VUKANOVIC IN the first part of this article (in Folklore 1989:i, pp. 9-24), I described some of the traditional beliefs about witches current in the Central Balkans up to the end of the nineteenth century, or sometimes even later. So great was the fear of them that it was thought that every man should try to protect himself and his home against them in every possible way. Various seasonal rituals were believed to be efficacious for this; so too was the use of many different charms, amulets, and plants, both in seasonal rites and at all times of the year. Special precautions were employed to protect newborn babies, their mothers, and young children. But there were said to be some people whom no witch could harm, and these will be first described. IMMUNITY AGAINST WITCHCRAFT There is a popular belief that there are people who have a mark upon their body which protects them against witches, though it loses its power if a witch sees it.' In Herzegovina, such people are said to have a 'lucky star' on their foreheads, and it is best for them to keep their caps pulled down to cover it.2 Among the Serbs it is still to some extent believed that witches cannot harm anyone born on a Monday, Tuesday, Thursday or Friday, since these are 'masculine days'-so called because their names are of masculine gender in Serbocroat.3 SEASONAL RITUALS The dates on which apotropaic rituals are observed relate to the church calendar, and especially its great feasts: particularly important are Christmas, 'White Shrovetide' (the Saturday before Lent), and Easter.4 Often it was said that the witches themselves were particularly active at these times, so it was most necessary to protect oneself from them. In some parts of Herzegovina it was the practice at the end of the 'Great Fast' (Lent) to take the first morsel of food out of one's mouth after chewing it a little, to make a hole in it, and to tuck it behind one's sash. After supper is over one should climb some hill, or onto a wall, and there whistle three times through the hole in the morsel. At that, many witches will come, and one must guard the morsel so that none snatches it; when one wants to drive them away again, one should rub it with garlic and give it to a dog to eat.5 It has long been the custom of Serbs at Christmas and Easter that every member of the household or clan rubs himself with garlic on the chest, the soles of the feet, and the armpits, for it is believed that on those holy days witches eat people most.6 While rubbing children with garlic on those days one recited the formula: 'When the witch has counted up all the blades of grass on the ground and all the leaves on the trees, then let her kill my child!' It was also Serbian practice to put a garlic bulb or a juniper twig on the windowsill on the evening of St Thomas's Day (October 19), which would keep witches away from the house all the year.7</page><page sequence="2">222 T. P. VUKANOVIC In Herzegovina witches were said to be greedy for small children-mostly infants-to eat on the night of White Shrovetide. As a protection against them, everyone would taste garlic before going to bed, the fire on the hearth would be made with thorny branches, and finally the door would be bolted with an iron bar on the inside, upon which the oldest woman in the household would repeat the following charm three times: 'Witches, fivefold devil's lovers, when you have counted up all the stars in the sky and all the grains of sand in the sea, then you will do harm to me, my home and my household!'8 In the neighbourhood of Sarajevo in Bosnia, before going to bed on the night of White Shrovetide, a knife was stuck into the bedroom door, garlic was rubbed on children's chests and the soles of their feet, the broom was turned upside down behind the door, and a small spit with an eggshell and a doughnut on it was stuck above the door. This was to stop a witch or a Nightmare (incubus) entering the room to strangle or otherwise injure the children.9 In Poljice (Dalmatia) it was a custom at Christmas to put ivy vine with leaves by the front door, after which no witch would cross the threshold. Moreover, when somebody recognized a witch he had to threaten to denounce her to the whole world if she harmed him, and she then would do him no harm.'" In Konavli, near Dubrovnik, witches were believed to be most powerful at Vodokrs' e (January 20, St John the Baptist's Day), so to ward them off people put in the corners of their houses 'some blessed incense or a piece of blessed candle' (which the priest had used in a service)." In Maglaj (Bosnia), on the night of St George's Day, the custom was that several hard- working youths got together, in the still of the night, and went to the crossroads, taking with them the skin of a black goat without any white spot. Then, one would blow the skin up while another would say: 'As this skin inflates, so shall the enchantresses and witches swell up until they come to us!' and the rest would cry 'Amen!' When the skin was inflated enough they would tie it firmly and walk all round the village till they came back to the spot where the skin had been inflated, and where they waited for the outcome of their magic. Presently, all the enchantresses and witches would come to them, begging them to untie the skin and trying to prick a hole in it to let the air out and set them free. The youths carefully memorized who they were, and threatened to betray them if they did any harm to anyone in their village, whereupon the witches gave their promises not to do so, and only then did the youths untie the skin and set them free. Had they not untied it, it was believed that 'all the witches would have burst from internal pressure'.12 There was a similar practice among the Kuxc6 of Montenegro on the morning of Christmas Day.13 In some parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, when eggs were being broken on the eve of White Shrovetide for making pies, all the eggshells were stuck on a small spit of hazel wood, reciting the incantation: 'Not the eggshell did I stick, but the witch!' If a particular woman was suspected of being a witch, her name would be mentioned as well. Then the spit with the shells on would be stuck into the wall above the front door with the words: 'As these eggshells have been put on the spike, so shall the witches be when they come to this house.' This was thought to be so strong a protection that on the eve of the day when witches gathered round the house the devil would surround it with a line of iron spikes so that no witch could come anywhere near it.'4 Eggshells, in popular Balkan beliefs, protect against witchcraft and the evil eye; even the egg itself is regarded as an amulet. ' However, it was the practice of the Montenegrins to smash the eggshells into tiny pieces, for if they were left as two halves, the spirits of witches were believed to use them as boats.'6</page><page sequence="3">WITCHCRAFT IN THE CENTRAL BALKANS 223 The practice in Bijelina and Vlasenica (Bosnia), before going to bed on the night of White Shrovetide, was to put an old peasant sandal on the fire and bank it up, so that it would burn slowly and give out an unpleasant smell, which witches could not stand.'7 THE PROCKA BONFIRES (MARCH 1) One of the most widespread, elaborate and long-lasting rituals of seasonal protection against witches is that performed on Procka (March 1), on the eve of White Shrovetide, among all ethnic groups and peoples in the Central Balkans since olden times. According to popular belief, witches are holding their spring gathering at this time. The ritual centres upon one or more bonfires, generally called the krljaves'ica, which means literally 'the witch'; it was practiced mostly by children, from twilight through the whole night, and still is performed in certain places. Thus, among the Kuxc6 tribe in Montenegro, on March 1 children used to collect plenty of manure which they set on fire to send out large wreaths of smoke. In Podgorica (Titograd) children would light fires at White Shrovetide and amuse themselves jumping over them and crying: 'A witch is burning!' This custom was kept up until shortly before World War II.`8 In the south of Serbia, where the rite is called kara-ves'tica or krlja-vestica and has been performed since ancient times, traces of it survived until recently, and indeed it is still partially performed in certain areas. The ritual was performed as follows in Lescovacka Morava:- On the date of Procdka, (White Shrovetide, the Eve of Lent), children would pile hay into cocks in the streets, setting several of them in a straight line, set them on fire, and then jump over them, shouting: 'Kara-kara vesiica!' ('Black, black witch!'), sometimes adding 'Stara baba ves~ica!' ('Old hag witch!'); the fires themselves were called karavestica too. Everybody present would jump over them, which according to ancient belief was done so as to ward off sickness in the ensuing year. Little children were also carried over the fires by their mothers, to the accompaniment of the same shouts. All the older children would blacken their faces with the soot of the burnt hay and run through the streets uttering shouts about witches. In Lescovac, they would attack girls to blacken their faces with this soot. In some villages children would make wooden rattles for the occasion and run through the villages carrying burning hay pinched in a wooden trap, and shouting: 'Aralajka, taralajka, prodje sirna nedelja!' ('Aralajka, taralajka, Cheese Sunday has passed!'). In Slisanj, people called them orataljke. On that night, mothers would make small crosses on their children's foreheads with hay soot. Finally, it should be mentioned that when the children started jumping over the fires, women who were in mourning offered them cakes.19 In Vranjsko Pomoralvje, which is also in Southern Serbia, pens are swept out on Procka day, and all the garbage is piled at a crossroads or in the streets, together with branches gathered from trees, tobacco, and straw from corn or hemp, from all of which a large bonfire is built. After dark, it is all set alight, and when the fire dies down children start jumping over it, singing: 'Krlja, krlja vesica,/Krlja, krlja, deda babu trlja!' ('Witch, witch, witch!l Grandpa is rubbing grandma!'). When the fire has died down to ashes, everyone rubs his face with the soot. If there are any sick or weak children in the community who cannot jump over the fire, they are carried over it, which will make them healthy and strong thoroughout the coming year. The whole process of preparing the krjalvesica bonfire is surrounded by rules and traditions, which are particularly fully observed by boys from Vranje.20 The boys who are to make it must meet in the street on the morning that the krjalvesica is to be built,</page><page sequence="4">224 T. P. VUKANOVIC to decide about what is to be prepared for it. Sometimes the preparations could last as much as fifteen days. Any boy who was invited to take part in this work but did not do so would not be allowed to jump over the bonfire; instead, he would be blackened with soot and driven away if he attempted to come near it. Great attention would be paid to the building and size of the bonfire, for there was competition between groups of boys, and the winner was the group that made the fiercest and largest fire in the street. Some boys were charged with collecting materials for the fire, others with bringing potatoes from home, or even stealing wine from other people's cellars. Usually about ten litres, some in pitchers, some in jugs and flasks, would be collected for each group of participants. And one boy would be entrusted with the important task of stealing a hen from somebody's chicken coop. Instructions were almost always given beforehand as to what was to be stolen for the ritual, and from where. Nobody in the town would get angry with boys for stealing wine from his cellar or a hen from his chicken coop, for to do so would be considered very shameful. In Vranje, the krjalvehica fire was usually made at a crossroads or in a street with the communal fountain. A necessary ingredient in it is the so-called puckarce or 'cracker' hay, which is laid towards the bottom. Sometimes the krjalvehtica is built like a ridge-topped shock of straw or hay with a pole in the middle. Instead of the cracking hay old tyres have been used in the bonfire lately, because of the great smoke and strong smell they give off when burning. Participants would not tolerate intruders from other groups who tried to spy on their bonfire in order to make their own bigger and better, and any such attempt would end in the intruders being driven away. When night fell, the largest krjalvehsica would be lit first, and then all the others. As a rule each pile would be set alight in four places. The broom which had been used in collecting rubbish for the fire would usually be thrown on it to burn too. All the boys were looking forward to this moment, and to the ritual as a whole. The oldest and strongest among them had the privilege of jumping over the fire first, and after him the rest; they would invite one another, crying: 'Let's jump over the krjalvehsica!' Neither the boys of better-off families nor those of peasant families recently settled in the district would take part in the rite, but they would be allowed to watch, whereas, as has been said, any who had actually refused to help in the preparations would be driven away. As for the stolen hen, it was never slaughtered with a knife, but instead the strongest of the bonfire boys would rip its head off the body with his own hands. Then the hen was plucked and gutted, but neither washed nor salted, and was put on a spit to roast over the fire, while the potatoes cooked in the embers. Then they would start eating. Each boy would get a piece of hen and some potatoes with some wine, and they would eat sitting round the fire and poking it; the meal and the singing would last till dawn. (Sometimes, however, butcher's meat would be bought instead of the hen.) As the fire died down, heads of households, who had gathered round with their children, would run home lest the bonfire boys should blacken their faces. Sometimes, however, these grown-ups would blacken one another's faces, or their children's, for good health and prosperity. After the ritual was over, all those who had taken part in it had to take a bath. It was believed that every boy who had eaten the meat of the hen would vomit next day. Finally, on the following morning, if there remained any fire still alight, it would be put out with water or wine. This ritual was performed on the day of Procka in 1986.</page><page sequence="5">WITCHCRAFT IN THE CENTRAL BALKANS 225 To understand this ritual, one must bear in mind that in Balkan folk belief a black hen is one of the forms commonly assumed by a witch when she transforms herself; the roasting of the hen therefore signifies burning the witch herself. It is also likely that the food and drink are at the same time an offering to the witches active at this season, and that the souls of all the children believed slain by witches gather round the fire to share invisibly in the ritual. Cults of the dead and of underworld deities, as well as of supernatural beings and demons, are characterised by feasts of this kind.21 The statements by the boys that they always vomit next day should also be noted; most likely this is due to the state of extasy brought on by sitting up round the fire all night. DEFENCES AGAINST WITCHES' ATTACKS Besides the seasonal protective rituals, there were traditional ways of guarding oneself or one's household at any moment when attack by witches was suspected. Among the Croats on the islands of BracJ and Hvar the best way was said to be to keep a knife at hand, so that when a witch came to choke one, one would make a scratch on the wall with it; next day, one would see corresponding scratches on the woman's face, and she would not choke one again. However, the incident must be kept as a secret between the witch and the victim only, with no witness present, or the counterspell would fail.22 In Praputnik, anyone whose home was haunted by a witch could, it was said, get rid of her by climbing the belfry and smearing his hands with oil from the bell, which he would then rub on his chest.23 According to another record, also from Praputnik, the oil must come from a bell dedicated to that saint the man is named after.24 Oil has considerable significance and apotropaic function in Balkan tradition.25 In Bukovica (Dalmatia), it was the custom on seeing a woman believed to be a witch or Nightmare, to make the gesture known as 'sticking out horns' behind her back.26 Sacred words and gestures were also thought potent. There is a legend from this area of man who flew with witches to feast in some house, but an old woman there crossed herself and said 'So help me God and the Mother of God!' before eating, at which all the witches fled up the chimney.27 Witches were thought to dread the cross,28 and the name of Christ.29 In legends, witches at their Sabbaths are said to vanish when an onlooker crosses himself and says 'To hell with you!'30 or says 'So help me God and the Mother of God!'31 To protect themselves against hailstorms, which were thought to be due to 'evil clouds' created and guided by witches, the Croats of the island of Hvar used to ring all the church bells, which was called 'to ring into the sky'. Moreover, they used to fire guns at the sky, and sometimes shoot balls of blessed wax from muskets.32 An interesting group of practices centering upon chains and knots was employed as protection against the perils that might arise if a woman suspected of being a witch entered one's house. The chain used is that which hangs over the hearth, a highly significant object associated with the luck of the house and with the spirits of dead ancestors, who are believed to reside in it. There is a taboo against swinging it, offerings to household spirits are laid near it, and it is customary to lift it up and tie it after it has been used. Its apotropaic powers, therefore, are great.33 So at Poljice (Dalmatia), when a suspected witch came to a house, the custom was to turn this chain upside-down and set the broom upside-down behind the door, and if she really was a witch she would be unable to leave the house.34 In other parts of Dalmatia firm knots would be tied in the chain while she was in the house, and she would be unable to leave till they were untied.35</page><page sequence="6">226 T. P. VUKANOVIC The chain might also be used as a general protection against witches. On the island of Krk it was unhooked on Christmas Eve and dragged over the cobbled pavement to clean the soot off it; this was believed to drive off the witches who gathered at Christmas, for the soot, as well as the chain, was apotropaic. In Herzegovina, to turn the chain upside- down was said to stop witches coming down the chimney.36 Some Croats would turn it upside-down at White Shrovetide to ward off witches.37 In some parts of the Serbian homelandS, it was still customary as late as the begining of the twentieth century to tie the chain over the hearth on the eve of St George's Day so that witches could not harm the livestock.38 Fire was also a potent weapon. In Vlasenica, if a woman or a man suspected of witchcraft visited someone in his house, live coals would be thrown over the threshold behind them so that they could do no harm to the household.39 In the same district, if a moth flew into the house at night it was thought to be a witch coming to take away milk from the cows. It was caught, sprinkled with salt, and taken out through the front door with the words: 'Go off, and come tomorrow to get some salt!' Next day some woman from the village would come to borrow salt, and thus show that she was the milk-stealer. The household would receive her calmly, and offer her a chair, while one of them tried to set her dress on fire by throwing live coals on it. When it lit, he would cry: 'Run away, or you'll burn!' After this, it was believed, she would be unable to steal cows' milk.40 AMULETS AND APOTROPAIC OBJECTS The custom of wearing amulets and talismans has long existed in the central Balkans, being recorded among many peoples: e.g. Albanians, Bulgarians, Vlachs, Macedonians, Muslims, Slovenes, Serbs, Turks, Croats, Montenegrins, Gypsies and others. They were also worn by the Germans, Russenes (Ukrainians), Rumanians and other peoples in the Voivodina. They consisted either of words copied from ancient Christian or Muslim prayers, or else of various objects of many different kinds that were believed to be protective. A written amulet was usually worn in a little triangular or rectangular box, or in a long drum-shaped metal container which might even be of gold or silver. Among poorer sections of society, pouches of woven cloth or leather were used. Sometimes the amulet was worn hidden among the clothes, but it could also be hung on a little chain around the neck or across one shoulder and under the opposite armpit as a visible protection. Amulets were mostly worn by the Muslim population, both rural and urban, and the practice was certainly introduced from the Near East by the Turks, who conquered the Balkans towards the end of the Middle Ages. Among Christian parallels may be mentioned the custom in Herzegovina of wearing inscriptions as protection against witches, hanging on a red thread under the left armpit or inside one's clothes. One such inscription reads: +++ Curse upon thee, damned wretch, accursed witch; God and the angels of God be with me, other saints and holy Fathers.+++41 In the vicinity of Dubrovnik, at the request of peasants, some priests 'gave blessings in a sealed booklet' to ward off witches42. In the vicinity of Sarajevo, 'an inscription against the witch was sewn on the inside of a baby's clothes, to be always worn by him.'43</page><page sequence="7">WITCHCRAFT IN THE CENTRAL BALKANS 227 Besides these sacred texts, a wide variety of other objects, both natural and man-made, were thought to have apotropaic powers; many of these, by their archaic nature and their widespread parallels, must be judged part of the ancient cultural traditions of the Balkan peoples. The following examples will illustrate this. Special significance is attributed to metal objects, particularly those of iron, copper or silver; that supernatural enemies fear iron is a very widespread belief.44 Besides the iron hearth-chain discussed above, an important protective object in the Balkans is the penknife, especially the black-handled type with a non-folding blade, samotvorna britva. In some places, e.g. in Prizren and the Ibar valley, it.is made in a special magical way for this purpose. The blacksmith makes it from a single piece of iron or steel, and when he has finished forging it he strikes the anvil three times with his hammer. According to popular belief, its magical power will be most effective if it was made at night, by a blacksmith who was assisted by his wife, and if both of them were naked, and if a wax candle was burned meanwhile. The knife protects children in particular against witches, but can also serve other magical purposes. Its price should not be bargained over; instead, the blacksmith and his wife are rewarded with bas~zluk, i.e. a present usually consisting of articles of clothing tied up in a kerchief. As will be seen in the next section, such a knife was in many areas laid in or beside an infant's cradle. Other metal objects of significance are carding-combs, whose iron teeth are, it is thought, feared by demons; scissors; axes; sieves; sickles; iron rings and hoops; tongs; and copper pots. One of their commonest uses was to be placed near an infant's cradle or hung above the door of the room in which the infant and the mother are lying; examples of this will be given in the next section. Prehistoric stone arrowheads, which are thought to be 'thunderbolts' or 'thunder stones', are credited with the power to protect against demons and the evil eye, and are also worn as amulets against witches, for example in Bukovica in Dalmatia.45 Stones with natural holes in them are protective too, and are hung on the arch of a cradle.46 Amulets of animal origin include horns, which the Croats on the island of Mljet hung on pigsties 'lest the witches should suck the blood of the swine'.47 In the town of Djakovica, a wolfs canine tooth was fixed as an amulet on a child's cap or vest 'lest witches eat him'. In the villages of the Ibar valley, a tuft of wolfs hair was sown to a child's cap or clothing to protect him from demons and witches. Among Serbs in the town of Prizren, cat's claws and fur were similarly used. A wolfs jaws were used to protect newborn babies against witches, so as soon as it was born it was pulled 'through the wolf's open jaws' (zev od vuka), in the district of Rogozna. The fleshy anus of a hen or cock was considered a powerful amulet when cut, dried, and sewn to the front or the shoulder of a child's clothing to protect him against bewitchment and various demons; this was practised by the Serbs of the Ibar valley and in the villages at the foot of Mount Kopaonik.47 Finally, there was a custom of Roman Catholic Albanians in Metohija in the old days to go hunting snakes between 'the two St George's Days' i.e. between the Catholic and the Orthodox dates for celebrating this saint. Only the head of the caught snake was used as an amulet, sewn in a piece of cloth and put into a leather or metal amulet-case; it was mostly worn by children, in order to protect them from witches.48 Various protective plants and objects made from plant materials are of importance in Balkan tradition. Almost all belong to the group of 'sacred plants' which are believed to bring good luck to the home and household that uses them as talismans or amulets, and protection against witches is one of their significant functions.</page><page sequence="8">228 T. P. VUKANOVIC Garlic is said to have apotropaic power to guard the newborn infant in the cradle and the newly-confined mother, especially during and after the birth; several examples of this will be given in the next section.Its purpose is to protect the newborn from evil spirits (especially the babice, the demons of childbirth) and from witches; it also protects adults from vipers. Because it is powerful against witches, it is used in food, and is rubbed on the body, as was seen earlier in the descriptions of seasonal rites.49 Since ancient times the hawthorn (Crataegus oxyacantha) has had an important role in Balkan myths, religion and magic. This tree is, at heart, a cosmic tree; hence it is used as an apotropaic object. One of the most powerful protective devices among Serbs is a cradle made from hawthorn wood, especially for use in families where infants keep on dying. The hawthorn is also, however, a shadowy tree in which demons capable of causing sickness reside. But it can ward off witches; the Serbs in Valjevo podgorno used a hawthorn-wood stake for this purpose, and also to avert vampires; they called it 'witch thorn'."5 Moreover, thorns in general were held to be powerful against evil, regardless of the plant from which they came - hawthorn, juniper, or other. Among the Macedonians in Skopska kotlina, witches were thought to fear only fir-wood, which is there called 'fir thorn'.51 Various timbers were regarded as appropriate for making cradles because protective powers were attributed to them. These were the oak, which it was thought no witch or demon dared attack; wild cornel (Cornus), also worn as an amulet; hazel, which is almost invariably used for cradles, especially for making the arch on them; lime wood; and yew. All these are sacred trees with important functions in Balkan beliefs.52 Yew was also used for making small crosses and triangles to be worn by infants as amulets or laid in the cradle, sometimes accompanied by ivy berries.53 Two plants credited with apotropaic qualities were common valerian (Valeriana officialis) and elecampane (Inula helenium); both were sewn to children's clothes as amulets to ward off witches, and the latter was also sometimes burned as a type of incense.54 Elecampane should be picked according to certain rituals: it must be done either on Biljani petak, i.e.the first Friday following Easter, or during the period between the feasts of the Assumption and the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary (August 28 and September 21 in the Orthodox calendar). It must be dug round with a stone, and when the digging is almost complete the stone must be thrown up in the air and the plant pulled from the ground before the stone has fallen to earth again. If the stone falls before the elecampne has been pulled out, its magical power is said to be small.55 A type of dried mushroom called siriga, vesiica or c&amp;ohajo (all words meaning 'witch') is used as an amulet to ward off witches, epidemics and thunderbolts, especially among the Gypsies, Albanians, Serbs and Turks of Kosovo, and in the district round the small town of Vucdtrn. It is placed in the house by the window or hearth.56 Other plants believed to ward off witches include Ruta moss;57 bryony (Brionia alba) picked around St George's day;58 wild cherry (Prunus avium);59 and coltsfoot (Tussilago farfara).60 Finally, mention must be made of the so-called 'witch-vomit' a substance sometimes found on fruit-trees and said to resemble 'curdled milk belched out by an infant'. The Serbs of Kosovo would soak this overnight in water and give it to a sick child to drink early in the morning; they thought he would surely die straight-away without it. In Herzegovina, and also among the Montenegrin tribes Moracd and Rovci, it was said that when a witch has devoured someone's heart she has to sick it up, which she usually did in the mountains, where no one would find her vomit. However, anyone who found</page><page sequence="9">WITCHCRAFT IN THE CENTRAL BALKANS 229 the hardened vomit (called siranik) and wore it as an amulet could not be harmed by witches."' The most efficient vomit was believed to be that which they threw up at dawn in the week of the new moon, or that from a place where they had feasted at their Sabbath, beside some fence. It was gathered and sprinkled with holy water, and a prayer was read over it, and then it would be given to a sick person whose illness was supposedly due to witchcraft, for him to drink it and wash his face with it. However, this had to be done secretly, lest the holy water should be trodden on. The sick man was believed to get well afterwards.62 PROTECTION OF NEWBORN INFANTS AGAINST WITCHES AND EVIL SPIRITS Among the Balkan peoples there have existed many magico-mythological practices to protect newborn infants from supernatural dangers --primarily from witches and the demons believed to attend on childbirth (called babice, literally 'midwives'), and also occasionally against vampires and Nightmares (incubuses). All sorts of amulets and apotropaic substances would be used, as the following examples will show. When a child is born in the area of Zaglavak (eastern Serbia), next to him would be put a pair of steel carding-combs for wool, a black-handled knife, a broom, and some threads.63 In Levc'e area (Sumadija), a black-handled knife would be laid in the cradle at the infant's head, and a pair of 'gypsy wool-carding-combs' hung over his head, for no evil influence would dare come anywhere near these objects.64 In the area of Homolje, in eastern Serbia, a pair of carding-combs, a knife, a poker, a spindle, a penknife and a horn containing tar are all placed round the infant's head in the cradle, which is by the new mother's bed; also various herbs are burned as incense and wafted towards the mother and baby three times a day.65 All this is to keep the witches and the babice away. In the area of Stig, Serbia, the child's head is put between carding-combs as soon as it is born, so that 'the witch should get stabbed by them'.66 Nineteenth-century Serbs around Sarajevo thought it wrong to lay a baby in the cradle before making the sign of the cross three times on his chest with scissors, which were then laid under his head 'lest witches harm him or Nightmares kill him'.67 On the frontiers of Croatia, Serbian mothers rubbed their children with garlic at night and stuck knives in their cradles, for witches were believed to get into the house when the lights were turned out.68 According to a popular belief among Serbs, witches avoid unpleasant smells, so a horn full of tar, which they especially disliked, would be placed near children.69 Among the Croats in Bukovica, it was customary in springtime around St George's day to put little crosses of yew-wood and also ivy berries into the cradle to protect the baby against witches.70 In the past, the Muslims in Bosnia and Herzogovina believed that witches would put some kind of hook into a baby's nipple, by which they would suck his blood until they killed him. As a protection, a baby's nipples were rubbed with garlic, or a non-folding knife and a bulb of garlic would be put under the cradle. They also thought that when women bore still-born children it was because they were 'women of sweet blood' and that witches, Nightmares or ghosts killed their children. To prevent these stillbirths, the custom was that a blacksmith, working by night, would forge a horseshoe taken from a dead horse into a hoop, which the expectant mother was to wear round her waist till after the child was born. Upon the delivery she would take it off, bend it, and put it under the baby's head. There was another magical rite which might be performed to ensure a healthy, live delivery: The expectant mother must go to a mosque at night and take out a nail hammered into a bier which was in front of the mosque. The blacksmith</page><page sequence="10">230 T. P. VUKANOVIC must forge that nail into several little rings, working at night, which the mother-to-be must wear until the child was born, and then sew them onto his cap, lest witches and Nightmares should destroy him. Finally, a new mother used to keep a pair of tongs at hand at the delivery of the baby and also during the lying-in period of forty days following the birth. She would use them as she walked about the house, thus producing a clanking sound which protected her, because the local Muslim belief was that giants, demons and witches feared the tongs. Moreover, the blacksmith would forge little tongs which were sewn onto the infant's cap as a talisman.7 Among the Serbs in the villages of Kosovo, evil beings called babice, 'midwives' were said to lurk near the newly-delivered mother and her baby at the time of the birth, and especially on the third and seventh night after it and on the night of the fortieth day, the end of the lying-in period. These spirits were identified as witches and karakondjiule, 'black demons' mostly water demons. The mother and child were never left alone on these nights, but had someone to keep them company, and a light must be burning. During these forty days, the new mother was not allowed out after sunset; if she did have to go out she was not to walk under the eaves of the house because babice appeared there. If she went out, either with the child or alone, she was always accompanied by relatives, and if it was after dark she had a lamp with her, because according to popular belief demons feared the light. In the villages of Mount Kopaonik, a family whose children kept dying would lay in the baby's cradle, in order that he might have a long life: garlic, one grain of wheat, a non-folding penknife, one coffee bean,. a grain of salt, and a small yew-wood cross. On the occasion of first preparing the cradle to receive the newborn baby, all activities were aimed at warding off witches, Nightmares, 'midwife' demons, and other evil beings. First, incense was burnt and its fragrance let into the cradle, into which an old silver coin, the herb kopitnjak (Tussilago farfara, 'bull's foot' 'coltsfoot'), garlic, and a small black-handled knife were put, under the pillow. A little bell was attached to the arch of the cradle. Moreover, an open matchbox, in whlch sulphurated matchheads could be seen, a chip of kindling wood and a chip of yew wood were put near or on the cradle, while the inner sole from a peasant's leather sandal was placed over the newborn baby's stomach. After the cradle was 'made' incense was wafted towards it; this was commonly referred to as 'christening' the cradle.72 The use of an insole as protection is to be explained by the concept of magic protection through dirt.73 Serbs on the Rogozna used to put scissors and a garlic bulb, into which a needle and a thorn from a hawthorn bush were stuck, by the infant in the cradle. When a woman had given birth, a sickle was stuck into or hung upon the front door, where it remained for forty days and sometimes up to half a year; at harvest time this could only be done once the reapers returned from the fields, but at other seasons it was done immediately after the birth.74 In some cases a chip broken off the dog's bowl was put in the cradle or the swaddling-clothes; according to popular belief this was done to make the baby 'as fit as a dog' whereas at the root of the practice was protection against evil supernatural beings.75 Among the Serbs settled along the Ibar Valley it was always the expectant mother's mother who furnished the cradle, which she did on the eve of the delivery, while it was the young woman's mother-in-law who prepared the cradle and laid the swaddled infant in it. 'A pair of scissors with open blades is put under the pillow.' In some villages in this district a stick of dogwood was put in first, then a penknife and garlic, or two or</page><page sequence="11">WITCHCRAFT IN THE CENTRAL BALKANS 231 three matches under the pillow; a mitten was also knitted and a button and loop crocheted and laid on top of the swaddling clothes, so that anyone who looked at the baby with the Evil Eye 'would burst and die'."76 It protected against witches and other evil beings as well as against the evil eye. Another form of protection was to give the child a name which would guard against evil beings. In the Middle Ages, the Serbs in the regions of Kosovo considered such names as Kukavica, Starina, Star and Trnovica to be apotropaic; the last-mentioned means 'Thorn'. The names Mrtvak, recorded in 1481, and Nadojin also had protective significance.7 The practice among the Serbian and Montenegrin clans, in families where children kept dying, was to name the most recently born baby Vuk ('Wolf) or Vucdna ('She-Wolf), in order that he or she should survive -- that is how a well-known Serbian scholar, Vuk St. Karadjzik, got his name. Sometimes, a person whose own given name was Vuk was chosen as godfather. The purpose is to render the witches, demons and evil spirits helpless by opposing against them a magic force greater than their own, for the wolf is regarded as a mythical animal whose very name is enough to protect one against all kinds of monsters. (The use of a wolf s tooth, bones or hair as amulets was mentioned in an earlier section.) The use of such names is known among other peoples too, especially Bulgars, Russians, Albanians, Gypsies, Germans and Turks.78 COUVADE AS A PROTECTIVE RITE The ancient practice of couvade was mentioned by Herodotus as early as the fourth century B.C. as being used in Africa, and has also been recorded in antiquity in the Mediterranean countries, later in the Middle Ages in feudal China, and at the beginning of the modern period in Brazil. In the opinion of the present writer, it is based on the wish to protect against witches.78 Among Albanians, a man who practices couvade is called a mirkosh or merkof; this is recorded as the Christian name of an Albanian in northern Albania in the cadastre of 1485.80 The traditional couvade, as last observed at the village of Mogila in the area of Gornja Morava (Kosovo) in 1921, consisted of the following:- When the child was born, his mother hung the copper cauldron on the chain over the fire, put the baby in it, and set light to some straw under it. Then she swung the cauldron with the baby in it, saying: 'I am cooking four-hundred-year-old meat'. Thereupon she quickly took the baby out of the cauldron and carried him into the next room, where she laid him in bed beside her husband. Then the mother lay down in another room, and instead of her baby the perajka was placed beside her-i.e. the wooden puddle with which clothes were pounded when washed. Afterwards, the mother went to the threshold, where she shouted three times: 'Come, come over here, you evil spirits! Take the puddle and devour it! You shall not find my son again!' According to legend, the demons came at night to look for the child at his mother's side, but finding only the puddle they scratched and gnawed it all over with their claws and sinister teeth. For seven days, the father observed the custom of the couvade and lay with the child. The objects which would normally be put beside the mother and baby (e.g. wool carders, a comb, garlic) were placed beside the father instead. He also observed the dietary restrictions, feeding chiefly on yoghurt 'so that it may be sweet to the child but sour to him'. Later, during the period from the seventh to the fortieth day, the father observed the couvade only at night. Usually the mother went to nurse the child, but sometimes</page><page sequence="12">232 T. P. VUKANOVIC he was brought to her. When the period of forty days expired, the father went with the baby to a meadow with a golden willow (Salix vitelina) in it, pricked the little finger of the baby's right hand with a needle, and dabbed the blood three times on the tree, saying 'I leave the sweet blood in order to take the sour!' After that, he made three little holes in the tree with a bore, from which he drank three drops of sour sap, then he dripped a drop of the baby's blood into each hole, and went home with the baby by a different route. When this ritual had been performed, the naming of the child began. First, the names of the three oldest men in the neighbourhood were selected, then the baby was put in the cradle and three candles were lit, each having beside it a piece of paper with one of the three chosen names on it; it was the name next to the longest-burning candle which would be given to the child, but this name would be kept secret for another forty days, after which it would be publicly made known. That was how the couvade was performed in Mogila, Kosovo, in 1921.81 Certain details deserve comment. 'Cooking' the baby in the copper cauldron is based on the mythical belief that fire can make a person immortal; in Greek myth Thetis tried to make her son Achilles immortal by holding him over a fire, and Demeter did so for Demophon, the son of Keleos. The use of the puddle as a substitute for the baby certainly comes from its shape and size, and from the anthropomorphic appearance it sometimes has; also, being used in washing, it is constantly in contact with running water, which assists its apotropaic powers.82 The custom of keeping the infant's name secret to protect him from harm was also known in Ireland.83 THE FORTIETH DAY As will already be clear, the period of special danger after childbirth was believed to last for forty days, and the mother, the infant, and in case of couvade the father, had to observe various magical precautions during this time. In the village of Vranjski Priboj in Juznomoravsko Pomoralvje, the fortieth day was marked by an interesting and archaic custom. Early that morning the bottom tile of the east kapc'uk, i.e. hip of the roof, was taken out, and some woman had to wash her face in water poured from the wider to the narrower side of the tile into some vessel. Then the baby was bathed in the same water. Then the water was taken to the west wide of the house, to a spot under the west hip of the roof, where a hole was dug in the ground and the water poured into the hole over the same tile, again from the wider towards the narrower side. While performing this rite some woman-either the midwife who had attended the birth or some other old woman of the clan-would say these words: 'Damned women! Damned women! You cannot harm the child by day! You shall drown here at night!' Then the tile was placed over the hole and the earth was put on top. Children were forbidden to relieve their bladders or bowels on that side of the house, lest the witches should see their naked bodies and so be able to harm them. This apotropaic rite centres upon the house roof, more precisely the east and west hip tiling; in ancient traditions, the roof and attic are the abode of the souls of ancestors, as well as of demons in general, deities, and fates; even the high god himself enters the house through the roof.84 CONCLUSION In an earlier article on the role of obscene objects, actions and words in Balkan magic,"8 I showed the conservatism of modern Balkan peoples in the protective rituals they adopted-in those cases, mainly against the Evil Eye and against male magicians.</page><page sequence="13">WITCHCRAFT IN THE CENTRAL BALKANS 233 In the same way, the material assembled here shows that the apotropaic customs and rites directed against witchcraft are very varied, and in many cases are rooted in the remote and primitive past of the human race, having been preserved among the Balkan peoples up to the present day. They also offer an interesting basis for comparison with the traditions-often less fully preserved-relating to comparable customs in other European countries.
