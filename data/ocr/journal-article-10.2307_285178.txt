<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND LETTERS * ABSTRACT Feminist philosophers have argued rhetorically that women scientists view the world differently from their male colleagues, and will therefore conduct their work on the basis of different paradigms. The argument, however, begs empirical support. Here, evidence is offered that female ethologists working in East Africa select substantially different vocabulary to describe their work than do male ethologists publishing in the same sources. Discriminant analysis was applied to a sample of vocabulary drawn from 122 scientific papers, and classified in terms of nine variables: those concerning cooperation and female gender are the most important in discerning women's approach to natural systems. Scientific Vocabulary Divergence among Female Primatologists Working in East Africa Elizabeth R. Adams and G.W. Burnett Kuhn has presented a theory of paradigms historically at work in science.' A paradigm, or conceptual pattern, moulds and filters ob- servations of the physical universe. When paradigms change, either through revolutionary discoveries or through accumulation of evi- dence that is inconsistent with established theory, science changes the filters through which the world is observed and understood. Kuhn's concepts accompanied a general effort in many disciplines to state directly the content and operation of their paradigms. Many of these attempts were in the supposedly 'soft' and social sciences,2 where established paradigms may impose orthodoxy and conservatism, rather than wisdom and insight. Kuhn's challenges were warmly welcomed in feminist studies, where de Beauvoir's influence had firmly established existential, phen- omenological, and Marxists ideas,3 and where, in any event, Social Studies of Science (SAG E, London, Newbury Park and New Delhi), Vol. 21 (1991), 547-60</page><page sequence="2">548 Social Studies of Science philosophical and scientific orthodoxy was mistrusted as innately repressive and patriarchal. Feminist philosophers and scholars argued for loosening orthodox science's grasp, particularly its adversarial approach and presumed objectivity.4 In theory, women (and male colleagues with a feminist outlook) are less likely to view the world as dichotomous and hierarchical or arranged in systems of dominance and discrete categories. They are more likely to search for connection, association and cooperation. The received view of a feminist paradigm of science, baldly sum- marized here, prompts a curiosity about the efforts of scientific women themselves. Donna Haraway, in her intense study of prima- tology, unravels mysteries surrounding evolution, human origins, males and females.5 Gender is understood as 'the politics of the socialization of sex'. Here we describe the influence women have had on the primatological discipline. Their published work has prompted conceptual integrations that are the products, at least in part, of women's adherence to the traditional methods of science. Jeanne Altmann's oft-quoted paper provides a systematic, rigorous, and objective means of recording animal behaviour.6 All the field reports included in this study in some way relied on empirical methods. Similarly, objective measures are employed here to fulfil the self- corrective imperative of science itself. The discourse surrounding a feminist method of enquiry suggests that consensus among feminists has not been reached.7 Accepting the feminist proposition is prob- lematic without empirical evidence. The argument that women sci- entists view the universe differently, and consequently contribute to paradigms differently, requires observing some aspect of the be- haviour of a fairly large number of female scientists with respect to that paradigm. Divergence, in other words, must be demonstrated before a biological or social basis for sex differences can be explored. In this paper, evidence is presented that one aspect of female scientists' behaviour differs substantially from that of their male counterparts in a field with rapidly changing paradigms. The group of women scientists studied is of primate ethologists working in the field in East Africa, and they are compared with male ethologists working in the field. The observable behaviour compared is the two groups' selection of vocabulary in reporting field studies. The approach assumes, as Gadamar concludes,8 that language equals meaning, implying that similarities in vocabulary reflect congruent points of view, while divergence represents dissent.</page><page sequence="3">Notes &amp; Letters: Adams &amp; Burnett: Female Scientific Vocabulary 549 Ethology and Primates Ethology is a branch of ecology, the study of organisms' relationships to each other or their surroundings, specifically concerned with ethos, nature or disposition. As such, it is the science of character formation or animal behaviour.9 Humans have long been fascinated by observing animal behaviour and making generalizations about it. While those who lived close to wildlife developed profound understanding of the animals around them, most attempts at generalization have been little more than an anecdotal anthropomorphism cherished in folklore. Neo-Darwin- ism, moreover, seemed to suggest that behaviour is genetically de- termined, and consequently its study is scientifically unproductive. By the 1950s, however, the central themes of animal behaviour study and the procedures for studying those themes had been defined.'0 Armed with a paradigm, a new generation of scientists from dis- ciplines as diverse as photography, anthropology and zoology took to the field, intent on making major contributions to the new enter- prise, ethology. Primates have been among the most studied animal groups. Backed by an extensive observation of primates under captive conditions ranging from zoos to prestigious research laboratories, primatol- ogists had the advantage of well-developed hypotheses to be tested on the basis of field observation. They had the further advantage of a popular belief and a debatable scholarly proposition that observed primate behaviour is related to human behaviour at an early stage of development. East Africa (Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Rwanda), because of its large populations of free-ranging primates in national parks and large ranches, was a logical laboratory for enquiry. Under- standably, field scientists brought to the field the current paradigm the group was held together by a single dominant male, dominant because he was the most aggressive. The scientific agenda was to describe the operation of this hierarchy." Evidence began to mount, however, that primate society was far more complex than supposed. What was aggression, and what value did it have to individual and group survival? How was dominance established and maintained? Despite all the noise and appearance, was dominance and aggression really all that important to the group? Do primate groups organize themselves in the same way in all en- vironments? Is there dominance and aggression among females? How does the organization of females relate to the males? How are mates</page><page sequence="4">550 Social Studies of Science selected? How are the young reared? If competition seems apparent, is there cooperation and what role does it play in group survival? In any event, whatever the organization, how is it structured in various primate species such as gorillas, baboons, chimpanzees and vervet monkeys? A number of scientists who took to the field seeking answers to questions like these have been women. Several, such as Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey, have achieved popular acclaim, while others have undertaken their research without benefit of the press. Their number and their accomplishments, as indicated by their publication record, defeat any notion of tokenism. Does an aspect of their scientific behaviour - selection of vocabulary in their scientific papers - differ substantially from that of their male colleagues? Methods A bibliography of journal articles reporting field data by women scientists working in East Africa was created. A 20% sample of each article was then selected, and all substantive words within the sample identified and counted. The words with their frequencies were then classified into nine broad categories or variables (Table 1). The categories were established through an interactive process among feminist theory, word meanings and matrix design acceptability.'2 TABLE 1 Categories of Target Vocabulary Exemplary Words Category AGE Adult, Juvenile, Immature CATEGORICAL Class, Distinct, High-ranking COMPETITION Competitive, Aggression, Dominance COOPERATION Associated, Collected, Grooming DENSITY Abundance, Dispersal, Rare FEMALE Female, Mother, Sister GENERAL Context, Quality, Varying MALE Male, Paternal, Brother REPRODUCTION Copulation, Outbreeding, Lactation The objective was to compare this vocabulary with the vocabulary of male colleagues doing much the same thing in the field, and reporting</page><page sequence="5">Notes &amp; Letters: Adams &amp; Burnett: Female Scientific Vocabulary 551 it in exactly the same issue of each journal. Rarely, however, was a field article on primates by all male authorship immediately adjacent to a female-authored article. Consequently, for comparison, the nearest article with all male authorship reporting field ethological data was selected as a companion to each female-authored article selected for study. This procedure held constant variability resulting from changes in journal format and editorial board policies. For each male article selected, a sample of the vocabulary was taken that was the same size as the sample for the female comparison article, and the substantive words were identified and categorized according to Table 1. The resulting matrix, consisting of frequencies of vocabulary words selected by female and male authors grouped into broad categories, was submitted to discriminant analysis,'" with gender as the classification variable. The purpose of the male articles and their corresponding vocabulary is to define a point or region on a theo- retical variable, the canonical discriminant function, which could be defined as 'orthodox science', against which the female articles could be evaluated. The further the female articles are from the zone of orthodox science, the greater is the divergence of vocabulary, the greater the difference of female and male behaviour with respect to ethology's paradigms, and the more likely it is that females are contributing to the discipline's paradigms in ways that differ from their male colleagues. No paired comparisons between male and female articles were conducted. Results The Bibliography The bibliographic search identified 45 journal articles by women and another 40 of mixed gender authorship, giving a total of 85 articles. Only the 45 articles by women exclusively were used in the discrim- inant analysis. Seventy-seven male-authored companion articles were selected for the discriminant analysis. For eight of the female and mixed-gender articles, selection of a comparison article proved impossible. This occurred when the original article appeared in a highly generalized journal, such as Nature or Science, or a highly specialized journal outside of ethology and primatology (for example, Journal of the Acoustical Society of America).</page><page sequence="6">552 Social Studies of Science As in the case of most bibliographies, this one is undoubtedly incomplete, but it is assumed to be a representative sample and a relatively accurate model of women's contribution to primate studies. All entries identified fell between 1963 and 1987. Of articles ex- clusively by women, over half have been published since 1979, and over half of all articles have been published since 1981. The difference indicates an increasing propensity for women scientists to publish and to engage in joint authorships involving males. The 85 articles in the bibliography are distributed among 27 journals (Table 2). The ranking in Table 2 is the decile in which the journal appears in Garfield's Science Citation Index impact factor. The impact factor is defined as: 'A measure of the frequency with which the "average" article in a journal has been cited in a particular year .. . a ratio between citations and citable items published."4 TABLE 2 Ranks of Articles by Decile on Garfield's Impact Factor'4 Cumulative Percentages of Percentage of Ranks No. of Articles Ranked Articles Ranked Articles 1 17 26.2 26.2 2 14 21.5 47.7 3 7 10.8 58.5 4 15 23.1 81.6 5 0 0.0 81.6 6 9 13.9 95.5 7 2 3.0 98.5 8 1 1.5 100.0 9 0 0.0 100.0 10 0 0.0 100.0 Unranked 20 In other words, journals in the first decile are within the upper 10% of science's most frequently cited journals, one indicator of the prestige and vitality of the journal. Twenty-five percent of the journals carry- ing an article from the bibliography, and 20% of the articles, are within the impact factor's first decile, while over 50% of the journals, and nearly 45% of the articles, are in the first three deciles of the impact factor. This indicates that the articles in the bibliography are appearing in some of science's most important, vital, and prestigious literature.</page><page sequence="7">Notes &amp; Letters: Adams &amp; Burnett: Female Scientific Vocabulary 553 Statistical Analysis A 20% sample of the words in the 45 articles authored exclusively by women, and an equal sample of the 77 male-authored companion articles, generated a thesaurus of 1399 consequential words which were counted and grouped according to Table 1. A discriminant analysis was performed on these data (word frequencies). Table 3 summarizes the results of the analysis and shows the coefficients assigned to each variable (demonstrating the relative importance of each in distinguishing the groups).

Others score what might be considered as 'extremely female' (1.5 or more) in terms of their use of the vocabulary considered in this study. In other words, women field primatologists can, and do, publish using a vocabulary which may duplicate, but generally div- erges significantly from, the vocabulary used in traditional or 'male' science. The position of cases of mixed-gender authorship are also indicated in Figure 1, their position being 'predicted' by comparing their vocabulary use to the vocabulary use in exclusively male and female authored articles. The centroid of this group is -0.07, and 62.5% of the cases of joint gender authorship fall between the cent- roid of the all female- and all male-authored articles, indicating that something of a compromise in vocabulary selection is achieved when collaboration involving both genders is undertaken. The Variables Investigation of how individual variables relate to the canonical discriminant function (Table 3) helps to define some of the character of this divergency between female primatologists and other male ethologists. Possessing the largest canonical discriminant function coefficient, the variable FEMALE contributes the most to the com- posite function. Derived from the relative frequencies of female gender word use such as 'female', 'woman', and 'mother', a high count of FEMALE words combines with the coefficient to attribute a high positive score to a case. This indicates that female authors use the FEMALE variable to a greater degree than do male authors. This information is corroborated by the frequencies of use of the variable FEMALE (Table 4). The contribution of COOPERATION to the canonical discrim- inant function is positive and relatively large. This variable, com- posed of such words as 'bond', 'affiliation', 'cooperation', and 'con- nection', is aligned with the feminist concept of cooperation, and clearly is used more by females than by male authors. Table 5 demonstrates the distribution of the variable COOPERATION, with female and mixed authorships showing twice the use of male authors, from a similar number of cases. Conversely, the variable COMPETITION (Table 6) including such words as 'agonistic', 'aggressive, and 'competitive', contributes weakly and negatively to the discriminant function. The data suggest that orthodox science recognizes competition as a primate social</page><page sequence="10">556 Social Studies of Science TABLE 4 Use of Variable FEMALE by Male, Female and Mixed Authorships Average Use Percentage of Cases Use of FEMALE Per Case Using FEMALE Male 348 4.5 57 Female 772 17.2 93 Mixed 324 8.1 83 Female plus Mixed 1096 12.9 88 TABLE 5 Use of Variable COOPERATION by Male, Female and Mixed Authorships Percentage of Cases Use of Average Use Using COOPERATION Per Case COOPERATION Male 477 6.2 85.7 Female 632 14.0 97.8 Mixed 277 6.9 82.5 Female plus Mixed 909 10.7 90.6 TABLE 6 Use of Variable COMPETITION by Male, Female and Mixed Authorships Percentage of Cases Average Use Using COMPETITION Per Case COMPETITION Male 654 8.5 88.3 Female 417 9.3 100.0 Mixed 225 5.6 77.5 Female plus Mixed 642 7.6 89.4 pattern and suggests a growing interest in cooperation. The variable REPRODUCTION (see Table 7), comprised of re- production words such as 'pregnancy', 'copulation', and 'parent', is the most difficult to interpret. Use frequencies are greater among female authors than among male authors, but this variable con- tributes negatively to the discriminant function. The negative co- efficient of the variable REPRODUCTION may be explained by the</page><page sequence="11">Notes &amp; Letters: Adams &amp; Burnett: Female Scientific Vocabulary 557 statistical process undergone in determining the contributions of variables to the discriminant function. After the strongest variable (FEMALE) has been isolated, subsequent iterations of analysis hold FEMALE constant. In other words, all variable frequencies are calculated to correspond to an evenly adjusted distribution of the preceding variable. Since male authors use FEMALE half as much as female authors, male uses of REPRODUCTION are doubled for purposes of statistical evaluation, making REPRODUCTION an important variable in identifying male authors. TABLE 7 Use of Variable REPRODUCTION by Male, Female and Mixed Authorships Percentage of Cases Use of Average Use using REPRODUCTION Per Case REPRODUCTION Male 500 6.5 74.0 Female 511 11.4 88.9 Mixed 302 7.6 80.0 Female plus Mixed 813 9.6 84.7 The combination variable efficiently classifies authors by sex on the basis of categorical terms (Table 3). These categorical terms are themselves composed of words, and the frequencies with which those words are used. Some words are, of course, greater contributors than others. The word 'female', for example, is the greatest contributor to the variable FEMALE. A considerable difference exists between male and female uses of the words 'male(s)' and 'female(s)'. Table 8 shows the differential uses gathered from the sampled articles. Further work may be expected to identify ways in which words differently con- tribute to the discriminating variable, and how vocabularies reflect scientific paradigms in flux. An implied progressive step would in- volve a test of an outside text. Though a similar lexicon would be expected from another set of animal behaviour studies, general- ization of our results to other texts remains an anticipated outcome and awaits the findings of future research.</page><page sequence="12">558 Social Studies of Science TABLE 8 Male and Female Uses of the Words 'Male(s)' and 'Female(s)' Authors Use of 'Female(s)' Use of 'Male(s)' Male 289 543 Female 549 585 Mixed 264 257 Female plus Mixed 813 842 Conclusions The model built on feminist concepts of natural resources has resulted in a discriminant function composed of nine variables. Its success is demonstrated by its statistical significance and its ability to define distinct groups based on the gender of the authors whose works were analyzed. Further information is gathered from the variables' coefficients, which indicate the contribution of each to the function. The strongest contributor is the variable FEMALE; the differential in its use by males and females is corroborated by the frequencies with which 'female' words were used. The variable CO- OPERATION demonstrates the appropriateness of feminist claims to connection and cooperation as women's models for behaviour, as divergent from the traditional competitive model. REPRODUC- TION is a strongly male variable, although high use by both sexes is in evidence. The statistical strength of the model supports, at least in the case of ethology, the claim heretofore made in rhetorical terms, that women scientists approach their subject matter from a different perspective than their male colleagues. Causes for this divergence are difficult to isolate, and both nature and 'nurture' may contribute. However, it is also possible that this particular group of women in field situations experience greater freedom and describe their work differently than they would under more restraining, orthodox environments. Irrespective of the cause, the evidence suggests that women field ethologists working in East Africa do not entirely share the same paradigms as male ethologists working in the field. Nevertheless, the female approach to ethology has been acceptable to science and productive of influential results, as is indicated by the quality of publications that formed the basic bibliography for this study.</page><page sequence="13">Notes &amp; Letters: Adams &amp; Burnett: Female Scientific Vocabulary 559 * NO TES 1.
