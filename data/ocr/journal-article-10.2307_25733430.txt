<plain_text><page sequence="1">m The Evolutionary Invention of Race: W. E. B. Du Bois s "Conservation" of Race and George Schuyler s Black No More Dana Carluccio For humanities scholars debating the contours ofW. E. B. Du Bois's notoriously conflicted account of racial identity, the field of evolution ary psychology has seemed completely irrelevant. Similarly, the experts busy debating evolutionary psychology's claims would not consider it particularly interesting that Du Bois offered a conflicted account of racial identity. This essay argues that both groups are mistaken, and that twenti eth-century debates over racial identity and twenty-first-century debates over the study of human psychology have suffered as a result. Writers like Du Bois, I argue, were steeped in notions of evolutionary psychology, so our account of them and of their historical moment will be profoundly skewed if we ignore that discipline. By the same token, these writers' work can offer us new perspectives on how we debate this controversial discipline, and more broadly how we understand the relationship of biol ogy to culture at stake in it. Evolutionary psychology, which uses principles of Darwinian evo lutionary theory to make and test predictions about human psychology, has become astonishingly popular over the last twenty-five years, both as a research program and as a pop culture phenomenon. Its proliferat ing publishing venues, academic societies, and textbooks are echoed by journalism, novels, and movies that have trumpeted the field's hypotheses, making them as ubiquitous in US culture today as psychoanalytic notions, such as Freudian slips.1 Someone who has never heard of evolutionary psychology is nonetheless likely to believe that men find physical cues of Twentieth-Century Literature 55.4 Winter 2009 510</page><page sequence="2">The Evolutionary Invention of Race female fertility (like youth) attractive because it helps them pass on their genes. The popularity of such claims has done little to secure their accep tance. Critics charge that evolutionary psychologists create too simple or direct a link between biology and complex psychological or sociological phenomena. And although titles like The Triumph of Sociohiology suggest that the field has emerged victorious from these debates, the Center for Evolutionary Psychology at the University of California Santa Barbara (home to two of the field s most influential members) tells a different story: it maintains an active website that, like an election-season war room, assembles responses to emerging criticisms (Cosmides andTooby).2 Perhaps because of the fields current aura of both glamour and threat, scholars have paid little attention to its own evolution. The notion of an evolutionary psychology actually arose along with Darwinism in the late nineteenth century, much earlier than the 1975 academic birth usually marked by the publication of E. QWilsons Sociobiology.Yet scholars have only just begun to unpack the cultural development of the principles that coalesced into this academic field, and virtually no attention has been paid to the relation between its cultural and academic practices. In particular, questions of the relation of biology to human behavior arise nowhere more insistently than in debates over race in the early twentieth century. The demise of comparative anatomy, the development of relativist forms of cultural anthropology, and the development of evolutionary theory itself have already been explored as contexts for those debates, but their relationship to evolutionary psychology remains to be acknowledged.3 This essay investigates this relationship by turning to two writers who epitomize the potentially polarizing complexity of questions about racial identity: Du Bois and George Schuyler. Du Bois has become a famous example of a thinker who tried and failed to generate a nonbiologi cal account of race. According to Kwame Anthony Appiah s influential analysis, Du Bois s "The Conservation of Races" rejected the biological or "scientific" meaning of race only to insist on neat divisions of racial his tory that would be incoherent without that biological meaning propping them up. In Appiah s analysis, only biological community can yield those "common histories]" that align properly with racial identity, making Du Bois s attempt to reject biology but preserve race circular ("Uncompleted Argument" 27). If Du Bois's argument can work only by appealing to a bankrupt biological category on the one hand or to a conceptual circle on the other, it would indeed seem to be "uncompleted," as Appiah puts 511</page><page sequence="3">Dana Carluccio it. Jane Kuenz s reading of Schuyler, on the other hand, examines an op posing danger of incompleteness. Kuenz argues that Schuyler's assault on the notion of Negro art makes a "typical conservative mistake of only going halfway" (174): it acknowledges the "primacy of environment and history" in generating racial forms but then bizarrely discounts that primacy's significance by dismissing race, implying that any product of history is inherently meaningless. Kuenz turns Schuyler's thinking into a cautionary tale for why we should not interpret the incoherence of race as a convincing argument against its deployment as an analytic tool. The tension between Du Bois's failed effort to conserve race and Schuyler's failed effort to dispense with it shapes scholarly debates about race in modernist and contemporary culture. This debate is firmly en trenched between scholars who hold with Appiah that anyone writing on race must be choosing between a bankrupt biology and a conceptual circle and those who believe that race can be described coherently and nonbiologically at the same time. Walter Benn Michaels's literary his tory Our America epitomizes the former camp, viewing the resuscitation of biology through "culture" as the problematic hallmark of American modernism. Both Michaels and Paul Gilroy agree with Appiah that, in part because of this biological contamination of culture, contemporary cultural claims about race make sense only to the extent that they appeal implicitly to a dismantled notion of biological inheritance. On the other side, scholars who argue for the validity of race as a conceptual category have done so by questioning the assumed equiva lence of biology and necessity. Michael Omi and Howard Winant, for example, have insisted pointedly that social categories are not mere illu sions in comparison to biological categories.4 More recently, William E. Connolly has challenged the meaning of the term biology itself, arguing that revising the definition of this term so as not to equate it with direct genetic control of complex behavior would preclude the need to appeal either to discredited pseudoscience or to circular reasoning in order to talk about race.5 Connolly's view displaces the question of whether par ticular forms of experience are biological and replaces it with the question of how they are biological. He proposes that biology is multilayered, for instance, and describes some of its layers as directly racialized by culture within individual lifetimes. This essay uses Du Bois's and Schuyler's approaches to evolutionary psychology to historicize constraints on such reconceptions of the bio 512</page><page sequence="4">The Evolutionary Invention of Race logical. While we routinely conceive of the late nineteenth century as a time of unreconstructed biological essentialism, and while we measure that period through the eyes of a late twentieth-century idea of social construction, many early twentieth-century thinkers believed that evolu tion supplied a middle term between these two frameworks.6 If evolu tion could explain how simple forms developed into the most complex of biological phenomena, it could explain the ultimate complexity, the human mind, and its creative and transformative powers. For modernist thinkers, I contend, evolution made it theoretically possible to argue for a racial biology that consisted not of a set of genetically controlled and fixed traits, like those Appiah has in mind,7 but an inevitable cognitive propensity to act as if such traits existed. To come to terms with this view, this essay begins with the concept of adaptive function. Through this concept, I suggest, Du Bois located the inevitability of race in its usefulness rather than its coherence or stability. Such a functional account of race came to its apotheosis when combined with the capacity of evolutionary theory to explain cognitive habits as well as more traditionally embodied characteristics. This combination made it possible to create what I propose we call a cognitive fiction: that is, an account of the idea of race as functional. This essay then expands our understanding of this unique kind of fiction by reading George Schuyler's Black No More, a satire that dismisses all racial categories, as an attempt to explore such a notion. By attending to the logic of texts that self-consciously seek to interrogate cognitive fictions, we can appreciate that early twentieth-century notions of race escape some of our most entrenched descriptions of them, and we can use those notions to reframe interdisciplinary arguments about biology and culture today. "The vastest and most ingenious invention for human progress" "The Conservation of Races "points readers to Darwinian evolution as its framework early on, with references to Thomas Henry Huxley, the man popularly known as Darwin's bulldog, and to "Darwin himself" (816). Du Bois tells us that these scientists have toppled "old" ideas of race, such as "the five-race scheme of Qohann] Blumenbach," and thus represent the "final word of science, so far" on the issue of racialization. Far from 513</page><page sequence="5">Dana Carluccio rejecting scientific accounts of racial identity, Du Bois here aligns himself with these new scientific authorities, introducing Darwin as a figure who "himself said" something that Du Bois is about to say. This alignment calls us to examine Du Bois s essay from an evolutionary perspective. Such a perspective would recognize in the essay's opening a trope common to turn-of-the-century evolutionary writing. A genetic-essen tialist reading of Du Bois may read the essays opening references to "the hard limits of natural law" as an insistence on biological fixity, but this gesture actually belongs to early efforts to apply evolution as a theory of change to social forms. Darwin's Origin of Species employs this rhetorical device by using "artificial selection" (animal breeding) to model "natural selection."8 The analogy establishes a reverberating relationship between human control and natural processes that would influence subsequent efforts to use evolution as a social theory. An 1879 Popular Science essay by W. K. Brooks, for instance, applies evolutionary theory to gender psy chology by asserting that we must determine the gendered products of natural selection, or the "laws of nature," before we can knowledgeably manipulate those laws to achieve cultural change?in other words, we must determine "the [social] lines along which [human] progress is to be expected" (145). Francis Galton's 1909 formulation of eugenics more directly invokes Darwin's analogy: where Darwin used human selection as the pattern for natural selection, Galton reasons that "what Nature does blindly, slowly, and ruthlessly, man may do providently, quickly, and kindly" (42). Du Bois deploys this same trope when he notes that "any striving, no matter how intense and earnest, which is against the constitution of the world, is vain" (815)?a point that insists on natural law but also on its informed manipulation?that is, "striving." Du Bois thus commits to an evolutionary perspective for what it reveals about potential avenues of change. Du Bois makes the existence of race the condition of such change by telling readers that "There can be no doubt as to its [the race idea's] efficiency as the vastest and most ingenious invention for human progress" (817).This statement's sweeping confidence should stand out in an essay otherwise fraught with qualifications, but in fact those qualifications often obscure it. Critics have focused on the passage immediately before, for instance, which tells us that a race is "a vast family of human beings, gener ally of common blood and language, always of common history, traditions and impulses, who are both voluntarily and involuntarily striving together 514</page><page sequence="6">The Evolutionary Invention of Race for the accomplishment of more or less vividly conceived ideals of life" (817, my emphasis).To be sure, this answer is slippery.The opening "generally" hedges the insistent "always," establishing the central conflict between "blood" and "history" that Appiah focuses on, and the attenuations go on to include volition and vividness of conception.9 It is thus easy to read this passage on its own and conclude that Du Bois has no coherent defi nition of race, biological or cultural. But the language of "invention" that follows it suggests an effort to transcend these ambivalences, for invention has a Darwinian meaning that renders some of the tensions in Du Bois s definition of race irrelevant. Darwinian evolution requires biological inventiveness in two key ways?a fact that Daniel C. Dennett depends on when he depicts the study of evolutionary processes as a kind of "reverse engineering" (Dar win's Dangerous Idea 212). First and most obviously, variations themselves are biological innovations. Second, Darwin often presents natural selec tion, the process by which certain variations persist, as an inventive force. While natural selection does not actually generate variations, Darwin suggests that it does dictate the directions in which variation can proceed, and that it thus elicits traits rather than just winnowing or eliminating them. As he puts it, selection is the process not just of "adding [variations] up" but of adding them "in a given direction" (Origin 112).10 In this way, natural selection can invent, as the oxymoronic anthropomorphism of the phrase suggests. Moreover, the inventions of natural selection obey a law of utility rather than of stable essence. Natural selection, that is, engineers traits that get a job done, not traits that are internally consistent or coher ent. Thus we can read Du Bois s confidence that race is "the vastest and most ingenious invention of human progress" not as a strange counter point to his inability to scientifically define race but as a scientific defini tion of the term. Du Boiss establishment of evolution as the framework for his argument, coupled with his emphasis on "invention," invites us to see race as an evolved technology, one for which it makes less sense to inquire into essence than into efficiency. Race may be biological in this reading?part of the "hard limits of natural law" within which Du Bois insists racial politics must work?but it is not a stable set of traits. To understand this model of biology, we need to recognize that Du Bois translates the question of what race is (the question to which Ap piah devotes careful analysis) into the more pragmatic question of what it does?or as Du Bois puts it, the question of what "the function of race 515</page><page sequence="7">Dana Carluccio differences [has been] up to the present time" (819). His answer depends on another Darwinian concept: specialization. Darwin predicted that organisms that could thrive in their own unique environments would do better than organisms that could get by decently both in their own environments and in other potential environments. In other words, he predicted that natural selection would disfavor jack-of-all-trades organ isms in favor of those that had mastered one trade. The concept of adapta tion depends on this idea, and Darwin emphasizes it by faulting artificial selection for failing to be specialized enough: Man keeps the natives of many climates in the same country; he seldom exercises each selected character in some peculiar and fitting manner; he feeds a long and a short beaked pigeon on the same food; he does not exercise a long-backed or a long-legged quadruped in any peculiar manner. (Origin 113) For this reason, nineteenth-century evolutionary theorists often used the terms specialization or peculiarities synonymously with adaptation?includ ing in discussions of race. In keeping with this view, Du Bois proposes that specialization is races evolutionary value. After favorably noting "the different roles which groups of men have played in Human Progress" (816), he argues that race allows individual groups to achieve such spe cialized roles: to "develop for civilization [their] unique message[s], [their] particular ideal [s], which shall help to guide the world nearer and nearer that perfection of human life for which we all long" (819). He does not suggest here that particular races are inherently good at particular things: he emphasizes development, a term that does not suggest natural capability; he emphasizes ideals, a term that also does not suggest any easy embodiment of what is to be developed; and perhaps most im portantly, he uses the word striving to describe the development of these ideals?a term that he also uses to describe strenuous human efforts to enact evolutionary progress despite the limits of "natural law." The em phasis on hard work suggests that racial community fosters a singularity of purpose that results in more specialized and therefore more finely honed achievements than would otherwise be possible, not that it creates people naturally suited to certain achievements. Du Bois also maintains throughout "The Conservation of Races" that the black race has not yet fully developed its own specialized contribution to the evolutionary progress of the human?a reason why it needs to be conserved. 516</page><page sequence="8">The Evolutionary Invention of Race In this way, Du Bois's evolutionary analysis of race evokes Brian Boyd's recent evolutionary analysis of storytelling: the universalization of storytelling, according to Boyd, may stem from the capacity of stories to encourage intersubjective attentiveness to motive and intention, so that those who could conceive of stories would have had social advantages over those who could not. If race is an evolved technology in Du Bois's hands, it is in part a cognitive technology like storytelling, one that attunes people to each other and thus makes it easier for them to develop com mon goals. It is not an "essential difference" (815). We can thus see why Du Bois was comfortable with an account of race that melded biological and cultural history. Rather than simply reject biological accounts of racial identity?something that was hardly even an option at the turn of the twentieth century11?Du Bois tackled a more nuanced and potentially more influential goal: he threw his weight behind a definition of biology that he believed did not threaten racial equality. Du Bois's functional analysis of human psychology is not unique for his time. While The Origin of Species declined to apply natural selec tion to humans, Descent of Man did so with respect to psychological and not just physiological features. By the latter book s publication, Darwin had already inspired a growing group of philosophers and scientists to develop what was tentatively called evolutionary psychology.12 What has not been recognized is that functionalist psychology makes storytelling more than a mere analogy for Du Bois's evolutionary account of race. This is because of how we use the idea of function. Adaptive functions do not presume stable essences, so they are to some extent insulated from empirical inconsistencies. As philosophers of science generally agree, for example, organs can have adaptive functions even when they aren't fulfill ing them.13 Functional cognitive characteristics, I argue, acquire another layer of empirical insulation: once cognitive characteristics have functions, they can persist independently of their correlation to anything outside themselves. Thus the development of particular ideas or ways of viewing the world can persist even if those ideas or views do not precisely com port with the world they claim to respond to. People with functional ideas might behave as if those ideas were correct regardless of their accuracy or inaccuracy. This "as if" marks the intimacy between functionalist cogni tion and fiction.14 Although evolutionary theorists do not use the term cognitive fictions, they have recently deployed the logic I mean by this term to describe elements of human psychology ranging from religious experi 517</page><page sequence="9">Dana Carluccio ence to the frequency of self-deception, hypothesizing that humans are hardwired to weave certain stories about cosmological origins or about themselves, even where the stories are contradicted or severely weakened by all the available evidence.15 Although evolutionary scientists have been reluctant to explicitly apply such logic to embodied identity, Du Bois s treatment of race does so. The ambiguity of the very term invention points to this fact. The decidedly human character of this term (it's people who invent, with consciousness and design) persists alongside its cue to Darwinian mean ings of variation and natural selection. Thus when Du Bois says that race is the greatest "invention" for human progress, his statement can refer both to a set of evolved characteristics and to the human investment of a set of characteristics with racial meaning. It can refer, in other words, to race as Du Bois finds it and to Du Bois s own impulse to conserve it. We can map these two meanings onto the biological account of race that Appiah sees Du Bois slipping into and the cultural account of race that would explain why he does so. But from an evolutionary perspective, we can also see the slippage between biology and culture as a point, not a problem. The notion that humans have evolved mechanisms that lead them to construct the world in certain ways and not in others is precisely the claim of evolutionary psychology. This notion can be right or wrong, but it entails no logical contradiction of the kind that Appiah diagnoses. From this perspective, Du Bois's persistent ambiguities suggest that the evolutionary invention of race may be precisely the same thing as the social propensity to invent race's importance. In other words, evolution may have invented an inclination toward organizing the world as if race existed, rather than having invented a stable set of racialized traits. Such innate inclinations are what I propose we call cognitive fictions. This meaning reverberates in a suggestive passage that Eric Sundquist has described as the most important in Du Bois's essay (463). In this pas sage, Du Bois renames the invention of race, calling it "the race idea, the race spirit, the race ideal" (817).These terms are tricky in the same way that invention is, because each of them can refer to two distinct things: first, to a set of characteristics that can be posited of a race;16 and second, to the very notion (the "idea") of race. Preserving Du Bois's ambiguity suggests that the relation between these two possibilities is itself the notion that Du Bois's essay defends: that the evolutionary invention of race consists of the inclination to think in terms of the idea of race. Read in this light, it is 518</page><page sequence="10">The Evolutionary Invention of Race significant that Du Bois tells us that race differences consist of "conscious striving" (818), and that races "stand for" the ideals they strive after, rather than simply embody them (819). Beyond a tendency toward racialized ideals, Du Bois does not seem to have any particular racialized cognitive capacities in mind. Ultimately, this interpretation makes it possible to see Du Bois defending race as neither a fixed biological essence nor an arbi trary social construction, but instead as an evolved psychological structure. Du Bois was certainly not alone in hypothesizing that race had an evolutionary value, but his account does offer an unusual picture of what that value might be, which underlines the promise that he seems to have seen in cognitive fictions. Turn-of-the-century psychologists like G. Stanley Hall generally saw the value of race in its capacity to explain the progress of one individual race over another. By rejecting this interpreta tion and portraying the idea of race as valuable, Du Bois opens the door to a scientific defense of racial pluralism. His view joined the Spencerian notion of linear or teleological evolutionary progress (assumed in Halls argument) with a Darwinian model of branching evolution: the singular height of human progress would require many races to converge on civi lization from many directions. That innovation leads to a second argument that Du Bois did not make. Twentieth-century psychologists have established that people in the twentieth century reliably describe each other using three characteristics: age, race, and sex. Although the fact that people reliably do something does not automatically mean that it is biological, some psychologists have hypothesized that the presence of age, race, and sex as schemas in humans' biological hardwiring could account for these empirical results. Moreover, psychologists interested in this hypothesis have suggested that a racial schema in particular could facilitate assessments of group belonging?of membership in in-groups and out-groups (although some evolutionary psychologists have challenged this view).17 If Du Bois saw such assessments of group belonging as the evolutionary value of race, then he should have seen race prejudice (against the out-group) as a key constituent of racial identity. But in fact, Du Bois claims that "race prejudice" is not as inevitable as his readers might believe. It is "nothing but the friction" resulting from differences in "ideals" of racial groups (821). The specialized creation of those ideals is for Du Bois the real evolutionary value of race. Contemporary readers are likely to be uncomfortable with Du Bois's account of racial identity as I have outlined it, for the history of racism 519</page><page sequence="11">Dana Carluccio makes the notion of an inescapable inclination to see the world in racial terms seem dangerous, despite Du Bois s protests. Such a notion can also seem empirically superfluous?for even if we were sympathetic to Du Bois s project, why could we not posit an innate and general cognitive capacity for shared specialization and assume that such a capacity might organize itself around any number of features, including geographical closeness or physical similarity, among other things? In other words, why do we need to posit a specific cognitive inclination toward race to explain race s historical development? The answer is surely that we do not: we are free to conclude that Du Bois was wrong, and we have ample reason to do so. But to stop at this conclusion would be to waste the full oppor tunity of his essay. While an attention to evolutionary concepts can tease out new assumptions and assertions in Du Bois s argument, we can also use his argument to reconsider continuing controversies over just those concepts, as well. Specifically, Du Bois s argument allows us to reconsider the way we conduct debates over the claims of evolutionary psychology. To start off, it challenges our habit of seeing biology and culture as stark alternatives in analyses of human behavior. There is of course a long history of asking whether certain elements of human experience are biological or cultural, and we see that history in Appiahs analysis of Du Boiss work. Yet the nuances of Du Bois s argument demand that we ask another question as well: not whether race is biological, but in what way Du Bois conceives of biology. To ask only the former question is to insist on a false choice, for insofar as humans do not exist outside of their bodies, there is really no such thing as nonbiological experience.This fact motivates Steven Pinker s exasperation with scientific journals and newspaper articles that profess to be astonished to find that learning physically alters the structure of the brain: "Good thing," Pinker tells us,"because otherwise we would be permanent amnesiacs" (Blank Slate 86).Writing on racial identity,William Connolly makes a similar point: the body is racialized even if language, so cioeconomics, and history are part of the process that racializes it. We may want to ask whether something is genetically biological or not, but even this question is something of a false choice, for all biology starts off with bits of nucleic acids?genes?and so it is all genetic in some way, while none of it is entirely so. Thus the question is not whether experience is biological, but how. The demand that we might ultimately make of Du Bois s answer (do we really need to posit a specific inclination toward 520</page><page sequence="12">The Evolutionary Invention of Race race?) acknowledges exactly this point: it concedes for a moment that perhaps we can analyze the biological mediation of a cultural category but asks whether a particular way of describing that mediation is the best one available. This step gets us very close to debating the claims that lie at the heart of evolutionary psychology today. As Pinker s remarks suggest, proponents and critics of this field also do not argue over whether human behavior is biological, but over what form that biology takes. And more often than not, this means arguing over how capacious or narrow we should take that form to be. For example, philosophers and psychologists have tra ditionally posited that people have a capacity for general reasoning and an aptitude for learning that makes culture possible and significant?a parallel to the idea that humans have a general cognitive capacity for sharing specialized purposes that may be organized in various ways. On the other hand, evolutionary psychologists have more recently proposed that humans have highly specific mental modules that greatly narrow and constrain the range of what they can learn and do?a parallel to the idea that humans have an innate cognitive capacity for something as specific as race. When humanities scholars deploy the term biology as if it were an option, we may reinforce a cultural rhetoric that can distort these two approaches, making the former approach seem like the cultural one and the latter seem synonymous with biology. That way of talking may narrow definitions of biology in a way that forecloses debates over how the term should be defined. This problem is particularly pressing because debates over evolution ary psychology often lack awareness of rhetorical issues. Participants on all sides of disagreements over contemporary evolutionary psychology too frequently separate important rhetorical questions from empirical ques tions to which they are intimately related. Because both groups are leery of the hardwired reading of race that I have argued Du Bois presents, Du Bois s essay can present a neutral ground on which to recognize this point. I have argued that Du Bois presents an evolutionary and functionalist account of race as a hardwired cognition. Yet I have also noted that the language Du Bois actually uses is "idea"?the evolutionary value of race is the evolutionary value of "the race idea." That phrase has a significant rhetorical effect: it conflates the notion of evolved capacity with the notion of evolved content. It is possible to argue that people have the evolved capacity to share specialized purposes, and even that this capacity 521</page><page sequence="13">Dana Carluccio has evolved to be strongly triggered by observations of inherited or rough physical similarities. It is also possible to argue that people have a built in notion of race. But these two versions of the claim do not say exactly the same thing. The first version focuses on a diffuse set of biologically mediated procedures. The second focuses on a congealed and biologically mediated outcome. The choice we must confront in Du Bois s essay is thus not just a choice between fixed biology and malleable social con struction; there is also an unacknowledged choice between two ways of describing biology. And although the demand we are most likely to make of Du Bois s argument would skip over this rhetorical point in favor of an empirical question, that movement artificially narrows the debate back to biology and culture. In effect, asking whether something is biological has the unintended consequence of reinforcing a traditional and quite hardened definition of that term. By returning to the contemporary example of intelligence, we can see how attention to such rhetorical issues can reframe debates over biology, culture, and human experience. Proponents and critics of evolutionary psychology alike make rhetorical choices that foreclose the possibility of full debate over their positions. Evolutionary psychologists take the position that humans do not have a generalized ability to perform self conscious logical operations in open-ended and culturally determined situations, but instead have the narrow ability to blindly and intuitively analyze the logical constraints of very particular scenarios, such as a sce nario in which one must detect social rule breaking, or cheating. The evidence for this claim is that in experimental situations, fewer people correctly identify logically falsifying conditions when propositions con cern abstract rules (like rules about relationships of arbitrarily selected numbers and letters) than when they concern rules about social scenarios (such as rules that require someone to be a member of a certain group in order to have access to certain resources). The interpretation of these experimental results is highly technical and sharply contested, and I will not adjudicate the contest here. Instead, I wish to examine the rhetoric through which the interpretation is described. Typically, proponents and critics alike use the phrase cheater detection to describe the evolutionary psychology position.18 In other words, people are hypothesized to have a mental module that detects rule breakers. Like Du Bois s "race idea," this phrase translates cognitive capacity into cognitive content: at a rhetorical level, it implies that the mind has the concept of cheater built into it and 522</page><page sequence="14">The Evolutionary Invention of Race that it runs checks for environmental matches, much like face recognition software scanning a crowd for a particular image. Yet this is a rhetorical gambit, and it is not essential for describing the idea in question. If we were to grant evolutionary psychologists' interpretation of their results purely for the sake of argument, we could just as well restate it by saying that the human mind is generally capable of performing informal logic tasks, but that its ability seems to be sensitized or primed in social situ ations. The only difference is that we have not translated capacity into content. Admittedly, this rhetorical point is not likely to satisfy either proponents or critics of evolutionary psychology, all of whom are more concerned with asking whether or not its claims are correct; but my point is that when we fail to examine such rhetorical issues, we constrain our sense of what evolutionary psychology might be correct or incor rect about, and this constraint gives an unearned advantage to hardened definitions of the biological. Ultimately, this fact impacts not just questions about rule breaking but also questions about race and gender. Du Bois's willingness to ap ply the logic of cognitive fictions to embodied identity anticipates but also exceeds contemporary evolutionary psychology in this regard, for while evolutionary psychologists deploy the logic of cognitive fictions to talk about things like religion and self-deception, they have claimed to be much more committed to a brain that reflects the body where race and gender are concerned. Various branches of science have long challenged notions of racial biology, for example, and evolutionary psy chologists have correspondingly claimed to debunk the notion that race is a hardwired part of the mind.19 Research into gender biology, on the other hand, continues to thrive, and?using Robert Trivers's theory of parental investment?evolutionary psychologists have enthusiastically insisted that human psychology must duplicate biological differences.20 In fact, researchers often trade the rejection of race for the securing of sex: race is nowhere near as coherent a category as sex, Kurzban,Tooby, and Cosmides tell us. If we follow Du Bois's cue in recognizing various definitions of biology, however, we can create alternative possibilities within biology for reconceiving of race and gender without trading them against each other. Although we can thus get quite a lot out of Du Bois's essay, "The Conservation of Races" is ultimately only suggestive of the notion of cognitive fictions, its power and problems. Du Bois's argument points to 523</page><page sequence="15">Dana Carluccio a way of reading race that escapes the binary oppositions on which his logic may in some places seem to founder. More specifically, it draws on a functional mode of analysis that enables that escape and gestures toward the application of that functional analysis to human thought as its ultimate fulfillment .Yet to confirm the cultural significance of this notion of race, we have to look at other texts. The rest of this essay proposes that we can find such confirmation by looking at texts that seek to dispense with race both at the level of biological essence and of cultural construction, but nonetheless script races continual resuscitation.There are few better examples of such texts than George Schuyler s Black No More. By turn ing to it, we can begin to recognize both the early twentieth-century pervasiveness of this evolutionary model of racial identity and to better understand those evolutionary psychological principles that it draws on and are still at work today. "Getting rid of [race]" Like Du Bois, Schuyler assumes that evolution is an engine and engineer of human social institutions. He offers evidence for that view in the nov els Black Empire and The Black Internationale, published serially under the name of Samuel I. Brooks. This pair of black nationalist science fiction novels depicts the two-part evolutionary process that W. K. Brooks, Gal ton, and Du Bois present, in which humans must recognize natural law in order to manipulate it. In Schuyler s hands, a concerted scientific study of human civilization results in its complete racial reinvention, including the African overthrow of European colonial power and the replacement of it by a futuristic Utopia. In this account of large-scale social engineer ing Schuyler pauses to offer an account of the relevance of evolutionary theory to psychological structure. His journalist alter ego contends: We have to become conditioned to our changed environment almost over night, historically speaking. Physically, we live in the Twentieth Century; psychologically, we live many thousands of years ago. We come into this world made for life as huntsman or herdsman and find ourselves in an environment of whirl ing machines, confusion upon confusion for the sake of order, complications and responsibilities and temptations that try the hardiest souls and often leave them balanced precariously on the precipice of insanity. (Black Empire 94) 524</page><page sequence="16">The Evolutionary Invention of Race Schuyler's time scale is off (even "many thousands" underestimates), but he captures the kernel of evolutionary psychology: that is, the method of using an evolutionary history that has fit us for past circumstances in order to understand the parameters of present psychological possibilities. However, where Du Bois sees a continued function for such parameters, Schuyler views evolution not just as a source of progress but as a way people can become psychologically stuck, acquiring hardwired habits that are soon outstripped by the pace of human cultural change that makes people perennially maladaptive.21 Black No More makes a sustained effort to narrate this view by pick ing up with the psychological question that Schuyler poses at the end of his essay "The Negro-Art Hokum." In that piece he berates his audience for committing itself to incoherent notions of racial identity?identities that he describes using the term peculiarities, the same term evolutionary scientists used to refer to biological specializations. He closes the essay by punning exasperatedly on the word hokum to wonder "how come" a commitment to race persists despite the incoherence of the concept (663). Black No More works as an extended narrative thought experiment in answering just this question. Schuyler begins the experiment with Dr. Junius Crookman's invention of an electrochemical treatment called Black-No-More that claims to eliminate racial difference by turning blacks white?or as the novel's protagonist and one of the first people to undergo the treatment puts it, to be "getting rid of the Negroes upon whom all of the blame was placed for the backwardness of the South" (44).This protagonist, Max Disher/Matthew Fisher, facetiously reproduces Schuyler's exasperated confusion when he claims to be "puzzled" by the fact that newspapers and businessmen would be "bitterly opposed" to such "efforts to bring about chromatic democracy" (44), suggesting that they would prefer to remain stuck with a problem that they could seemingly eliminate. Of course, the very idea that eliminating race as a category of analysis is the same thing as eliminating blackness is one of the targets of Schuy ler's satire. But to understand the novel's analysis of racial politics, we need to recognize that Schuyler actually does claim to eliminate race in its pages .Yet it is not the Black-No-More treatment that produces this result. Rather, Schuyler comes up with another device that does achieve that goal?genealogical research. In an effort to maintain white supremacy, Arthur Snobbcraft?a leader of the Anglo-Saxon Association?commis 525</page><page sequence="17">Dana Carluccio sions a study that seeks to recover the genotypical truth of race behind the superficial phenotypical alterations made possible by Black-No-More. However, the project winds up implicating the wrong people s genotypes: as Snobbcraft discovers with horror, he and many other white suprema cists have black ancestors themselves. In his quest to locate a secure site of the whiteness that he takes for granted, Snobbcraft s project instead forces him to confront the insecurity of anyone's identification with white ness?even that of the people defending its exclusions.22 His project thus becomes a more powerful challenge to white supremacy than Black-No More has ever been: it makes visible what Schuyler called the "Caucasian problem" in place of the purported "Negro problem." Because Snobb craft s discovery puts him in the same position as the users of Black-No More, it also exposes that they both share the same white supremacist assumptions. This commonality reinforces a contention Schuyler made in his broader writings on race: that his peers' harboring a debasing desire for whiteness motivated their use of skin-lightening creams. Ultimately, then, Snobbcraft s elimination of whiteness ratchets up the satirical quality of the Black-No-More phenomenon as a representation of such behavior. It is not entirely surprising, then, that Schuyler invests greater power to undermine racial categories in Snobbcraft s discovery than in Crook man's invention. Where Crookman's treatment leads only to new oppor tunities for racial exploitation, Schuyler endorses the positive possibilities of Snobbcraft s discovery in saccharine terms that test satiric conventions. His portrayal of Matt Fisher's wife Helen as a stand-in for the supposedly dramatic post-Snobbcraft shift in the national white psyche encapsulates his endorsement. Minutes after giving birth to an unexpectedly dark skinned infant, Helen learns from her father, who brandishes a newspaper announcing the claim, that Snobbcraft's research has implicated her own family's racial ancestry. The emotional upheaval following this news yields to melodramatic indifference when Helen learns that her husband has been black much more recently than she: There was no feeling of revulsion_There once would have been but that was seemingly centuries ago when she had been unaware of her remoter Negro ancestry ... Compared to what she possessed, thought Helen, all talk of race and color was damned foolishness. (154) The naivete of Helen s response may seem to set her up for Schuyler's 526</page><page sequence="18">The Evolutionary Invention of Race trademark disdain. However, it also harkens back to the sarcastic dedica tion of Schuyler's novel to those white Americans, like Helen herself, who imagine themselves to be untainted by black "blood"?specifically, those "Caucasians in the great republic who can trace their ancestry back ten generations and confidently assert that there are no Black leaves, twigs, limbs or branches on their family trees" (xvii). Schuyler and Helen are thus in sympathy here, and in an often-overlooked moment, he legiti mates Helens response.The narrator declares wearily that Helen "would probably have been surprised to learn that countless Americans at that moment were thinking the same thing [she was]" (154). This remark draws attention to the narrators omniscience against Helens ignorance; however, the omniscient narrator leaves Helen's emotional experience unchallenged. This scene thus announces a narratological experiment in the elimination of race as a category of analysis; Snobbcraft s genealogy makes all talk of race and color seem foolish.23 Schuyler endorses this conclusion by quickly adding Dr. Brocker to the "countless Americans" in question.The doctor has been an arbiter of racial definition in Helen's hospital room, linked to the narrator's om niscience when he "smile [s] knowingly" at Marts revelation of his racial past. Yet he too claims to slough off the nations racialized history in one fell swoop, announcing cheerfully that "I'm in the same boat with the rest of you_I sure hope the Republicans win" (155). Schuyler s experiment continues by abruptly breaking off and then picking up again four years later, "in the last days of the Goosie administration" (176), at a moment when the entire country has become suddenly absorbed by skin color "again." The long narrative break and that last word "again" inform us that the social indifference to race imagined in Helen's hospital room is supposed to have lasted through all four years of the Republican's term. The fact that the novel allows one of its challenges to racial identity to work?that is, to effectively eliminate race?is often overlooked or even rejected in readings of the novel. In an otherwise persuasive account of racial capitalism in Black No More, Sonnet H. Retman suggests that it would be a mistake "to read [Helen s] transformation as indicative of a larger shift in attitude on the part of the public" (1458). Yet this read ing is precisely the one Schuyler instructs us?through his reference to "countless Americans"?to adopt. The most obvious source of Retman s oversight is that race is, after all, only temporarily eliminated in the novel, leading to an end in which, as Schuyler tells us, it is "again" in full force. 527</page><page sequence="19">Dana Carluccio That ending seems to signal Schuyler's indefatigable cynicism,24 and to suggest that we should not take what transpires in Helen's hospital room seriously. Yet we gain something by acknowledging the success that Schuyler scripts in that room along with its ephemeral quality. Specifically, we gain a fuller understanding of the sources of Schuyler s cynicism and the paradoxical account of racial identity that motivates it. To see how, we also need to recognize that just as the Black-No More treatment does not actually eliminate racial hierarchy (Snobbcraft s genealogy performs that task), so it cannot really explain its resuscitation either. In Black No More's truncated afterword, titled "And so on and so on" (176), Crookman discovers that his treatment turns dark skin several shades paler than the skin of people who were originally "white"; this discovery, Schuyler claims, is what "start[s] the entire country examining shades of skin color again" (177). Yet this claim plays a conceptual shell game with the novels double assault on race. Crookman s treatment is the novel's first and failed assault on racial identity; the second assault, Snobbcraft s genealogical project, is the successful one. For that reason, Crookman s closing discovery shouldn't matter, because it undermines the mechanics only of the novel's unsuccessful assault on race. It intervenes, in other words, in a debate that Snobbcraft s project has rendered moot: the fact that previously black Americans now have lighter skin than white Americans is irrelevant once these two racial positions have themselves been rendered incoherent, as Schuyler, Helen, and Dr. Brocker insist they have?and as the novel's most explicit racist, Henry Givens, acknowledges with the claim that "we're all niggers now" (156). By not acknowledging this incommensurability between the retirement and the reinstatement of racial hierarchies, the narrative comes to depend on a logical gap of the kind that Appiah diagnoses in "The Conservation of Races": that is, the ending requires the novel to return in an apparently illogical way to a category that it had seemed to write itself out of. Schuyler s narrative makes it very difficult to appeal to either tradi tional biological explanations or to cultural explanations of its paradoxi cal return to race. On the one hand, Schuyler's depiction of white as the new black leaves any stable biology of race in tatters. On the other, the novel's brief gesture toward history as an explanation for its closing turn of events is openly facetious. "To a society that had been taught to venerate whiteness for over three hundred years," the narrator intones, "[Crook man's] announcement was rather staggering. What was the world coming 528</page><page sequence="20">The Evolutionary Invention of Race to, if the blacks were whiter than the whites?" (177). The narrators "three hundred years" cues us to the oppressive weight of history's prioritization of whiteness, but what the world quickly comes to is a sudden national interest in darkening skin. The oppressive weight of history is thus sup posed to explain only that element of race's resurgence?skin color?that is about to prove most malleable. According to this line of reasoning, history invests whiteness with so much importance that Americans must actually reject it?a state of affairs that only undermines cultural explana tion. Finally, the closing return to race is also not guaranteed by capitalist markets that produce racialized consumers and commodities alike. While Retman is right to observe that "racial difference is too enmeshed in the markets ... to be easily effaced" (1456), that fact raises the question of how the market for race is suddenly reconstituted once Schuyler asks us to accept that the beliefs driving it and the institutional apparatus abetting it have indeed been largely effaced?however uneasily. It is possible, of course, to generate a variety of plausible explanations for the return to race at the novel's end. The most obvious might be that people find race an expedient way of preserving social privileges to which they have become accustomed and to which they would like to return. Yet the characters' resuscitation of race does not always seem as cynical as this reading would suggest. It begins with their becoming personally con cerned over the possibility of bearing "evidence of [their own] possession of Negro blood" (177)?an unself-conscious, affective appeal that simply takes discredited social meanings of whiteness and blackness for granted rather than longing to bring them back. This appeal reverts unthinkingly to a concern with individual relationships to whiteness and blackness, seeming to forget that to have "once been a member of a pariah class" (177) no longer refers only to individual shifts in racial belonging but in fact to a social shift in the very meanings of the categories to which one might belong. The characters' unthinking reversion to an outmoded racial model suggests that the conscious desire for historically racial privilege is not a complete explanation for what goes on at the novel's end. The evolved psychology that Schuyler discusses in Black Empire offers a good candidate for modeling the less strategic elements of that return to race. When Schuyler became discouraged late in his career with what he considered essentializing black appeals to racial identity, he referred con descendingly to those appeals as "racial fictions" ("Rising Tide" 106); in what follows, I will argue that cognitive racial fictions help account for the 529</page><page sequence="21">Dana Carluccio novel's end. Schuyler does very little in Black No More to explain explicitly how he gets from the hospital scene that eliminates race to the afterword that resuscitates it. However, a brief section does intervene between the two, and the title of Schuyler's ending?"And so on and so on"?points us back to it as an explanation for the novel's close. I will argue that this section not only revolves around cognitive fictions but also connects them firmly to the persistence of race. Examining the novel through this three part structure suggests that the desire of US citizens to restore race is the product of an evolved habit of thinking in racial terms, one that makes racial identity hardwired, ineluctable, and artificial at once. Racial fictions What intervenes between Schuyler's narrative elimination and resuscita tion of race is a disturbingly macabre tale of the ironically named Happy Hill, Mississippi. Like the larger novel, this tale begins by recording the white anger over Black-No-More that Matthew Fisher observed, with the narrator reporting that "the news that all Negroes had disappeared ... had been received with sincere regret by the inhabitants of Happy Hill" (165). The tale ends with an act of extreme racial violence that is largely indifferent to the race of its victims, an indifference that anticipates the resuscitation of whiteness through blackness that will take place in the novel's postscript. The interlude thus seems to act as a literal microcosm of the novel's overall arc. Because that microcosm is offered up between the two moments that generate that overall arc's apparent logical incon sistency, I propose that we read this section as a key to how that incon sistency is resolved. While Black No More as a whole raises the question "how come" posed at the end of "The Negro-Art Hokum," the interlude of life in Happy Hill returns to the psychological answer proposed in that earlier text. At one of his most cynical moments, Schuyler speculates in "The Negro-Art Hokum" that the best account of people's refusal to reject race is that most Americans, white and black alike, are simply and con stitutionally incapable of reasoned thought:" [racial] reasoning may seem conclusive to the majority of Americans," he concedes, but "it must be rejected with a loud guffaw by intelligent people" (99).This misanthropic speculation resurfaces in Schuyler's condescension toward the intellectual capacities of the residents of his archetypical Southern town. Schuyler 530</page><page sequence="22">The Evolutionary Invention of Race features the town's "inordinately high illiteracy rate," for example, on a list of things "the community might have boasted of" (164). The sense of intellectual inadequacy becomes linked to the townspeople's racial reasoning when Schuyler reports their inane confidence that "the people for miles around were with very few exceptions old residents and thence known to be genuine blue-blooded Caucasians for as far back as any resident could remember which was at least fifty years" (164). Yet Schuyler s portrayal indicts Happy Hill's residents for more than simple ignorance. We begin to see its more specific character in some of the most overbearingly ironic of the narrator's remarks, such as the implication that the community takes pride in ("might have boasted of") its illiteracy rate. Some of these remarks cross the narrator's and the characters' voices in a way that complicates the quality of the latter. For instance, the derisive portrayal of the residents' confidence in their ancestry acquires a breathless quality as it goes along, both because of its length and because it lacks punctuation?particularly before the "which" that introduces the most egregious piece of reasoning in the sentence. This breathlessness mixes sarcasm with what sounds like a spontaneous and sincere remark by one of the town's residents, creating the sense that the narrator's skepticism and the ignorance of "simple folk" (169) operat ing under the logic of "country people" (166) are actually intertwined in the residents of Happy Hill. In other words, Happy Hill's inhabitants are neither purely malevolent manipulators of racial discourses nor purely blind believers in them either. Instead, they seem compulsively indifferent to what Schuyler considers failures of "intelligent" reasoning?to the fact that they know they cannot coherently apply the categories toward which they're driven. This more complex depiction of what Schuyler considers the residents' cognitive deficiencies begins to capture the mechanics of cognitive fictions, which dictate that people think along certain lines even when they are capable of appreciating those lines' inaccuracy. Schuyler most fully depicts this cognitive style only by taking an extended narrative detour into a bizarre religion that drives the novel's most extreme act of racial violence. Given the length of this narrative detour, its explicit link to racialized violence, and the similarities of this violence to the resuscitation of race at the novel's end, I suggest that this religious portrait is key to understanding the novel's analysis of race. The Reverend Alex McPhule, a rural counterpart to Matt Fisher, is responsible for Happy Hill's new religion, whose rituals pair built-in biological drives 531</page><page sequence="23">Dana Carluccio and transparent social inventions. Schuyler seems to have been influenced by the popularity of psychoanalysis in the US in the 1910s and 20s, and turns largely to notions of a human sex drive to model this pairing. Like the religion that Schuyler portrays in Black Empire, McPhule's religion revolves largely around that drive.25 McPhule engineers individual sexual encounters and group sex scenes that involve most of the towns members, and his sermons descend into comical scenes of animalistic instinct, with him "runfning] around on all fours" to "embrace in turn each member of the congregation" (167). At the same time that these scenes depict an uncontrolled devolution, they couple it with a highly self-conscious artificiality: the revivals take place "on the darkest nights with the place of worship dimly illuminated by pine torches," and "these torches always seemed to conveniently burn out about the time the embracing and rolling started" (167). In other words, Schuyler's descriptions stress the ingrained compulsiveness and the artificial expendability of McPhule's rituals. They are ingrained and compulsive to the extent that McPhule has not invented the drives that he manipulates; the narrator reinforces that fact by reporting that "the majority of [the Reverend's individual partners] were middle-aged wives and adenoidal and neurotic young girls" (168).They are artificial and expendable, though, in the sense that McPhule's religion invents obviously arbitrary channels for those drives to work through. Thus the narrator reports that "every latchstring hung out" for the Reverend, so that "when the men were at work in the fields, [he] could visit . . . and comfort the womenfolk with his Christian message" (167). Schuyler's tale of Happy Hill, then, stresses social deceptions as an outlet for, or exploitation of, built-in compulsions. The fact that Schuyler creates McPhule and lingers so long over his role in Happy Hill at such a crucial moment in the narrative suggests the relevance of his religion's mechanics to Schuyler's interest in the persis tence of race. Schuyler explicitly connects these two things when McPh ule yokes his religion to a lynching that depends on an ad hoc redefinition of its victims' racial identity. By using McPhule's religious rituals as the context for the town's final racial act, Schuyler makes the biological drive run amok key to understanding the townspeople's racial experience. He specifically incorporates the artificiality and expendability of McPhule's rituals into that experience, stressing the self-conscious distortions on which both religious and racial ritual depend (and indeed conflating those distortions at the tale's end). Schuyler thus uses the interlude of Happy 532</page><page sequence="24">The Evolutionary Invention of Race Hill to turn a narratological experiment in eliminating race into a theory of race as a biological compulsion. As in "The Conservation of Races," race depends on an as-if structure. It becomes little more than a raven ous impulse to interpret and respond to the world in racially hierarchical terms, indeed a compulsion to distort what Schuyler in Black Empire called the "physical world" in order to fit those terms. Ultimately, insofar as the tale of Happy Hill models the narrative arc of Black No More, the novel makes Happy Hills link between cognitive fictions and race into an explanation of the novels own final racial act as well. At first, McPhule s own behavior establishes the centrality of an as-if structure. Thinking that he can use "a message straight from Heaven" to cement his religious monopoly over the town (168), McPhule simply invents a prophecy that such a message will appear, thus setting in motion a story that will both demand and explain the lynching in Happy Hill. He turns to newspapers to complete the research for his story: reading The Warning one day, he suddenly "got an idea. If the Lord would only send him a nigger for his congregation to lynch!" (168). He quickly weaves this plot device into his story, falsely informing the congregation that the Lord has conveyed to him what the message will be.26 As the days go by and the message does not appear, McPhule becomes desperate, worrying that he has paced his narrative ineffectively. Yet of course he is saved by Schuyler, whose own storytelling has long set up the arrival of Snobbcraft and Buggerie at the perfect time. McPhule s "if only!" ensures the ability to act "as if" when that time arrives. At this moment, the townspeople's racial behavior becomes firmly indebted to an as-if structure as well. As the lynching unfolds, Happy Hill's residents discover that the apparently black skin of the victims, Snobbcraft and Buggerie, consists only of dark shoe polish. They are openly "disappointed" to learn that the two men are white, only then to discover a newspaper account of Snobbcraft s and Buggerie s distant black ancestry, which they view as "sufficient excuse for doing what they had wanted to do at first" (174-75).The townspeople's earlier limitation of the one-drop rule to a fifty-year shelf life makes their reliance on it in this scene seem expedient. The strange notion that racial identity would supply an excuse?as opposed to a reason?for racial vio lence underlines that expedience. Like McPhule, the townspeople have "got[ten] an idea" from the paper they read, and are now acting it out. Putting the sense of compulsion together with this sense of artificiality alters the novel's depiction of just what race consists of in Black No More, 533</page><page sequence="25">Dana Carluccio suggesting that it is precisely a compulsion to think in racial terms regard less of what form those terms take.27 To read what takes place in Happy Hill as a microcosm of the novel's overall arc is thus to emerge from this interlude with a notion of cogni tive fictions that can account for the otherwise illogical move between the novel's narratological elimination of race as a category of analysis and its later resuscitation of it. If the strength of a traditionally conceived biology and of history are questioned at the novel's close, the strength of cognitive fictions has been established. The mechanics of this notion capture what is most inventive about the close of Schuyler's novel, includ ing the willingness of Schuyler's full cast of characters to retire race one year and revive it the next. These mechanics also allow us to understand the existence of characters who are driven to know the world in always already racialized terms even as they empty their objects of knowledge of any coherent content. The novel's excision of four years from its nar ration draws attention to this paradox, sharply juxtaposing the characters' sudden shedding of race and their equally sudden embrace of it, as well as the strange reversal in the racial values they alight on. This turn of events mimics the movement of Happy Hill's residents from wishing to lynch blacks to wishing for an excuse to lynch whites.The result is that race in the novel more broadly becomes both resilient and hollow, a compelling idea rather than a set of specific characteristics. This relocation of the force of race duplicates the subtle meaning of Du Bois's reference to "the race idea"?the capacity of that phrase to refer to the very idea of race. The compulsion toward that idea seems to mean that if people cannot think without race, they can invent it?can act as if it exists?as they go along. In keeping with the depiction of cognitive habits as central to racial hierarchies in Happy Hill, the epistemological relationship between the narrator and the larger cast of characters changes in the novel's afterword. Through most of Black No More, the narrator treats his characters with a distanced and knowing mockery, offering ironic juxtapositions that construct the narrator as sharp and jaded and puncture the characters' self-conceptions as delusional. The narrator notes, for instance, that after Reverend Givens's meeting with Matt, he "read over the definition [of the word anthropology] twice without understanding it, and then cutting off a large chew of tobacco from his plug . . . leaned back in his swivel chair to rest after the unaccustomed mental exertion" (49); on the other end of the political spectrum, we have the reported "excite [ment]" of the National Social Equality League when they learn of lynchings. Although 534</page><page sequence="26">The Evolutionary Invention of Race the final section of the novel reinstates those hierarchies, it almost never treats this return with its former belittling tone. That earlier demeanor crops up once, when Schuyler notes the supposed gullibility of the pub lic response to a study claiming that pale-skinned people are "mentally inferior": "Professor Moutthe's findings were considered authoritative," Schuyler chides, "because he had spent three entire weeks of hard work assembling his data" (178). Aside from this case, the novels concluding section straightforwardly recites Americans' sudden return to race. While the narrator's caustic tone implies that the book's characters are both intellectually inadequate and blind to the lapses in their own thinking, the forfeiture of this tone raises the question of just what has changed. The answer is that the novel has turned race into a compulsive way of knowing rather than a form of ignorance. If accuracy is not the relevant standard, then inaccuracies do not matter much either, and it makes little sense for the narrator to criticize characters for them. While Du Bois sees the notion of cognitive fictions as a point of flexibility in racial politics, Schuyler's emphasis on evolution as a source of "stuckness"?we are stuck seeing the world in falsely racial terms? reminds us that this altered understanding of biology can also lead to an opposing conclusion. It thus offers a lesson for approaching the role of cognitive fictions in evolutionary psychology today. While Du Bois's rhe torical slip from capacity to content had a congealing potential, Schuyler seems unable to see evolutionary psychology as anything but congealed from the outset. His work thus allows us to recognize that biology of the mind can cut two ways: it can demand that we rethink the very term biology or it can absorb the mind into the fixities presumed of the body. That risk is precisely the one at stake in contemporary debates over the use of evolution to understand complex human behavior. Yet while Schuyler's deployment of cognitive fictions offers a highly pessimistic view of racial politics, race is not the only thing that is con tinually reinvented in Black No More, and this fact points to a strange silver lining that Schuyler seems enamored with in the novel. For the novel also reinvents its protagonist, as his name change indicates. Max Disher's subjection to the Black-No-More treatment is only the first and least significant step in his reinvention. As the white Matt Fisher, he insinuates himself into the Knights of Nordica on the strength of a bluff and then singlehandedly revives the organization in the wake of its Black-No-More-induced decline, growing its membership and its bank accounts for his own profit, manipulating poverty-stricken workers and 535</page><page sequence="27">Dana Carluccio wealthy foreign financiers alike, all as he seduces the organization's erst while leader's daughter, who happened to have rejected him when he was black. Matt makes sure to have the contents of the organization's newly large bank accounts ready to dash off with when Snobbcraft's genealogical project puts a final end to his enterprise. And he is the last figure that we see in Black No More, grinning happily on a vacation with his family that seems to have lasted all of the last four years, his skin newly darkened to match that of his son. Matt's chameleon-like self-invention and business ventures together make him the quintessential American entrepreneur28 and offer a counterpoint to the otherwise psychologically stuck populace in Schuyler's US. In an interview with Ishmael Reed and Steve Cannon late in his life, Schuyler insisted that it would be a mistake to read Matt's leadership of a white supremacist organization as an example of minority self-hatred (141-42).The notion of cognitive fictions gives us a more sensitive way to take account of that plot twist. Matt's quick transition to leading the Knights of Nordica continues to mock any essentialist biology of race, but it also undermines our cultural expectations: we would expect that an African American man who has known only the racially hierarchical US of the early twentieth century would not be comfortable participat ing in the material practices of white supremacy. The fact that Matt slides smoothly into those practices simply because it seems profitable gives him an aura of imperviousness to his cultural training. He is an expert observer of the cultural landscape around him without being fully interpellated by it. This final rejection of both traditionally conceived biology and cul ture seems to suggest a possible value for Schuyler in a newly conceived evolutionary psychology: it may leave most people hopelessly subject to cognitive fictions, but for the evolutionary avant-garde who have escaped those fictions, it means that neither biological nor cultural history fully constrain them. Matt indeed seems immune to the cognitive fictions of race, and his entrepreneurial acumen is the mark of it. Not vesting culture with complete explanatory power seems to help Schuyler create such a figure, and the fact that he comes to seem like a stand-in for Schuyler himself suggests he is a figure Schuyler is quite taken with. This reading finally allows us to reconsider the idea that Schuyler made a sharp shift from the leftist politics of works like Black No More when he became vehemently conservative in the mid-twentieth century. To be sure, Black No More portrays US business practices as mildly crimi 536</page><page sequence="28">The Evolutionary Invention of Race nal, portrays unionization as the only rational response, and paints opposi tion to leftist labor organizers with the same brush used to paint Southern white racism more broadly. These portrayals do look very different from Schuyler s sharp rejection of all forms of "collectivism" in his autobiog raphy, along with his eventual political support of Richard Nixon. But an understanding of his disdain for the notion of cognitive fictions rewrites the relationship between these two points in his career. If Black No More represents a socialist spark that would burn out across Schuyler s career, it also shows that his evolutionarily influenced pessimism about human psychological nature was already drawing him to the captivating figure of the entrepreneur who would outlast it. Evolution, cognition, and biology In "Autobiographies of the Ex-White Men," Walter Benn Michaels re prised and updated the argument of Our America to clarify "why race is not a social construction"?or more precisely, why it makes no sense to try to maintain race once one has conceded that it cannot be a coherent biological category. Michaels's answer is basically historical: he argues that "the situation"?that is, the historical situation?of ascribing racial identity is identical to the situation of imagining a demonized biological "essence" (243), and that it is therefore just not possible to use the term race to mean anything else?including a socially constructed cultural identity. Rather than enter into the highly fraught debate about whether contemporary appeals to race can avoid the essences Michaels writes against, this essay has sought to show that a literary history informed by evolutionary thought challenges the very terms in which this question gets asked. W. E. B. Du Bois and George Schuyler, inspired by different attitudes toward evolutionary thought and moving in different political directions, both experimented in the early twentieth century with the idea that race could be an action rather than an essence?specifically, a cognitive action?without being any less inevitable for that. While much of the argument over Michaels s position labors to show that race is not just a "mistake" but a "compelling reality" (236), I have argued that these two writers imagined that race could be viewed as a compelling mistake. That Du Bois and Schuyler produce their alternative understand ing with evolutionary theory in mind, rather than engage specifically with particular scientific theories of racial identity, points to the need to 537</page><page sequence="29">Dana Carluccio approach literature as an incubator of and not just a way of responding to scientific ideas. In this case, Du Bois's and Schuyler s early twentieth century racial politics supply some of the conceptual tools that twenty first-century evolutionary psychologists have ironically presented as a new way to analyze race. As I have argued, the fact that both writers were interested in using evolution to split a difference between biology and psychology makes their ideas seem highly anticipatory of the contem porary cultural interest in evolutionary psychology. For instance, Nancy Bentley points out that Steven Pinker, in a discussion of evolutionary psychology, describes the affective bonds of biological kinship as both cognitive and fictive because these bonds depend on people's beliefs about their relationships to each other rather than on actual genetic re lationships: adopted children, for example, form filial attachments to the parents who happen to raise them (Bentley 275; Pinker, How the Mind Works 436). Du Bois's and Schuyler s anticipation of the present, however, also alerts us to potential problems with this model. These two writers sought to create a level where they could challenge and maintain tradi tional notions of racial identity at one and the same time. For Du Bois, I have argued, this approach maintained what he saw as valuable in race without requiring racial hierarchies. For Schuyler, it fit racial difference into a broader political pessimism that did not necessarily forsake the possibility of transcendent figures.29 In both cases, however, the result was to construct an evolutionary approach to human psychology as a kind of backstop against increasingly incoherent notions of embodied racial identity. That is, while both writers embraced the mind as an embodied site, the use of cognitive fictions as a model for describing that mind turned it into a kind of holding pen for categorizations associated with very traditionally conceived bodies. In our own moment, we can run this same risk by becoming overly enamored with the idea that the mind is embodied?an inevitable conclusion, but one that we often treat as if it answered the question of whether human experience is biological, rather than as an opportunity to expand the ways in which we can ask how it is so. Ultimately, Du Bois and Schuyler show us that at least some early twentieth-century writers did not find in evolutionary theory just a new vocabulary in which to restate old racial claims.30 Neither, though, did they find in it a set of ideas that compelled them to devise a particular set of new claims. At their broadest, Du Bois's and Schuyler's evolution 538</page><page sequence="30">The Evolutionary Invention of Race ary experiments took the idea that race could be real even though it might be a fiction and made it into the idea that it could be real precisely because it was a fiction.31 Such a notion fundamentally reworks relation ships among congealed terms?including necessity, contingency, biology, and culture?in which both evolutionary theory and racial politics continue to be debated today. It is thus necessary to come to terms with its role in twentieth-century US culture more broadly. Notes 1. For instance, the same year that Randy Thornhill and Craig Palmer went on a national media tour for a book that they described as an evolutionary psychology of sexual assault, David Foster Wallace's Brief Interviews with Hideous Men developed its own fictional?and highly ironic?evolutionary psychology of what are often misleadingly called rape fantasies. Ian McEwan's Enduring Love, in both its novel and movie forms, is another example that draws deeply on the idea of evolutionary psychology but invents its own hypotheses. 2. For recent examples of criticisms, see David J. Buller, Jerry A. Coyne, and Susan Oyama. These writers have replaced an earlier generation of critics that most famously included Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin. Evolution ary psychologists have by and large claimed to find both generations' critiques unconvincing. Leda Cosmides and John Tooby maintain the Center for Evolu tionary Psychology's website. 3. For a discussion of the displacement of comparative anatomy in studies of race, see William Stanton; for a discussion of the significance of cultural an thropology in studies of race, see George Hutchinson; and for a discussion of evolutionary theory and race, see Nancy Leys Stepan. 4. Although Michaels places Omi and Winant s work in opposition to his own argument, and although Omi and Winant accede to this opposition, in my view the opposition is false and obfuscating. Anthony Appiah notes in "The Conservation of'Race'" that it is possible to hold that race is an illusion without holding that the racial organization of society is an illusion. It is even possible for that organization to be both a mistake and a social construction. As Michaels notes, the "belief" in biological notions of race, "mistaken though it may be, has obviously had ... significant consequences"?namely, that we "live in a world that is still organized along racial lines" ("Autobiographies" 236); contra Michaels, it seems plausible to call this organization a "social con struction." Likewise, even if Omi and Winant are right to say that race is not a "mere illusion" (68), it does not follow that racial reality does not depend on a 539</page><page sequence="31">Dana Carluccio (historical) mistake. To the extent that the participants in the debate wish to sort it out rather than persist in it, the recognition of these facts would be useful. 5. Popular discussions of evolutionary biology often conflate biology with genetics, speaking of genes "for" all sorts of things: blue eyes, breast cancer, same-sex desire. Some scientists resist such a view, and a debate rages over the potentially misleading nature of the "gene for X" formula. In general, this phrase misleads by suggesting that some elements of organisms are genetically controlled and some are not, when in fact all elements of organisms depend in some ways on genes and in some ways on many other things (for example fetal environment). For a discussion of why many scientists resist this conflation, see Susan Oyama's The Ontogeny of Information, a. founding text of developmental systems theory. 6.1 owe this way of putting the point to Joel Burges. 7. Appiah does not argue, of course, that Du Bois was making an explicitly genetic argument. Rather, he sees in Du Bois's logic a notion that we have come to call genetic. That fact becomes clear in Appiah s reliance on the find ings of late twentieth-century population genetics to debunk what he sees as the contemporary repetition of Du Bois's logical error. 8. Gillian Beer reads Darwin's decision to make the analogy between artificial and natural selection as his way of taming the theory of natural selection, of making it more palatable to his audience of skeptics. 9. Shamoon Zamir points out that the "generally" and "always" make biology a superfluous condition, and history a necessary condition, of racial identity. While I find that observation convincing, I am not certain that it evades the critique Appiah advances of the potentially implicit return to biology in Du Bois's essay. 10. Beer discusses Darwin's struggle to talk about natural selection without personifying it as an agency-bearing force. At least some readers of Darwin, however, see the view of natural selection as a creative force as one of his most significant contributions. Elizabeth Grosz summarizes this "positive" version of natural selection thus: the pressures of population growth not only weed out the less adapted, those less able to subsist; they also impose an impetus on those who survive to produce increasing resourcefulness, to stimulate coloniza tion, economic initiative, and the exploitation of new markets and new resources. (34) She adds that natural selection "provides a more positive productivity when it 540</page><page sequence="32">The Evolutionary Invention of Race functions as the source of pressure on, or as an incitement to, those individuals and species that survive to even greater proliferation and divergence" (47). My own view is that the oxymoronic quality of the term natural selection makes it highly misleading in a way that contributes to errors of reasoning in evolution ary analysis, and we would do well to think of a better phrase. In any case, the point that Du Bois sees evolution as an inventive process holds. 11. See Dickson D. Bruce Jr. and David Levering Lewis on Du Bois's immer sion in late nineteenth-century social science's biological commitments. 12. The term evolutionary psychology was largely retired from use by the mid twentieth century, eventually to re-emerge as a subfield of what E. O.Wilson termed sociobiology in his book of the same name. In 1890 William James posed the question of whether "evolutionary psychology demands a mind dust" (146), and in 1909 G. Stanley Hall celebrated fifty years of "evolution and psychology" (251). Bert Bender discusses late nineteenth-century literary engagement with the principles that became evolutionary psychology in The Descent of Love and Evolution and "the Sex Problem." 13. See Ruth Garrett Millikan and Robert Cummins for different takes on how to do functional analysis. Nonetheless, both agree on this point. 14. It is certainly possible to develop a concept of cognitive fictions outside the context of evolutionary theory. However, the argument of this essay is that historically, this concept happens to have developed out of an adaptive func tionalism that depends fully on Darwinian evolution. 15. See Daniel C. Dennetts Breaking the Spell and Robert L.Trivers's "The Ele ments of a Scientific Theory of Self-Deception." 16. Sundquist draws out that meaning of the terms, seeing them as part of the concept of "volksgeist" with which (he notes) Du Bois would have been fa miliar. 17. See Gaertner and Dovidio for an overview of the potential effects of racial schema, and see Kurzban,Tooby, and Cosmides for an argument against the biological evolution of such schema. 18. Cosmides offers an example of this language by proponents and Buller and Hardcastle an example by critics. 19. See for example Kurzban,Tooby, and Cosmides. 20. Any introductory textbook of evolutionary psychology makes this point; see for example Barrett, Dunbar, and Lycett. 541</page><page sequence="33">Dana Carluccio 21. Read from an evolutionary perspective, this pessimism in Black Empire challenges the judgment that Schuyler made a sharp shift in the way that he talked about racial identity as his career progressed?a shift Henry Louis Gates traces in "A Fragmented Man." 22. In this regard the novel offers a fantastical version of what Adrian Piper imagines in "Passing for White, Passing for Black." 23. Outside of his fiction, Schuyler engaged in sincere efforts to challenge the racial sentiments of the white Americans Helen comes to stand for in this scene. His autobiography, Black and Conservative, discusses his faith in "re education" as an antidote to American racism (258) and outlines his "perhaps quixotic" 1943 participation in a campaign called the "Association for Toler ance in America," which aimed "to recondition the white masses by scientific propaganda" (259). According to Schuyler,"The error in our past procedure has been our disposition to labor with the enlightened five per cent to the exclusion of the unenlightened 95 per cent" (259). Jeffrey B. Ferguson, in his biography of Schuyler, also discusses Schuyler's attempt to found the Young Negroes' Cooperative League (YNCL), which he describes as part of a "ro mantic and ambitious vision" (121).These few examples suggest that the sac charine elements of this hospital scene are as much a part of Schuyler's vision as is the novel's later emphatic departure from it. 24. This diagnosis dates at least as far back as John M. Reilly's 1978 obituary of Schuyler. Reilly observes that Schuyler's satire is an "anti-utopia," a genre that has "faith in predictable behavior," "certain ... that human beings pos sess a core of strivings?love or envy, truth or dissemblance?that must always frustrate the conditioning Utopians prescribe" (107). For Schuyler, Reilly ar gued, such predictable behavior includes the idea that "everyone is a fool about color" (108). 25. It's useful to recall the argument of Frank J. Sulloway that the Freudian psy choanalysis from which Schuyler's notion of a sex drive and neurosis are de rived stems in its turn from applying evolutionary theory to human sexuality. 26. This point plays on a convention of racial narratives in the US of using cosmological or superstitious signs as a way to think about racial signifiers. In Huckleberry Finn, for instance, Jim tutors Huck in how to interpret signs like young birds flying. 27. This suggestion rewrites the pseudoscientific notion that different races experienced aversions to each other in accordance with supposedly different physical characteristics. In keeping with this idea, Darwin hypothesized that different races would have evolved specific standards of beauty. Schuyler's de 542</page><page sequence="34">The Evolutionary Invention of Race parture on this point marks the way in which he takes evolution for granted in order to generate his own account of racial identity, rather than accepting specific evolutionary theories of race. 28.1 owe this point to an audience member at the 2008 Modernist Studies As sociation panel "The Incredible Lightness of Difference." 29. Schuyler s manipulations of race in Black No More look ahead to the closing lines of his autobiography, published decades later: "There will be no color war here if we will and work not to have one, although some kind of color line there may always be, as there is elsewhere in the world" (352). 30. Nancy Leys Stepan shows that Darwinian evolution temporalized pre existing racial stereotypes. 31. George Hutchinson makes the former point in his introduction to The Harlem Renaissance in Black and White (221).
