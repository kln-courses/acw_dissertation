<plain_text><page sequence="1">MISCELLANEA BIBLICA THE PHILOSOPHY IMPLICIT IN BIBLICAL STUDIES A Note Towards a Transcultural Philosophy Very few fields of study are currently as much astir with new life and vitality as the study of the Word of God. Archeological discoveries and a new sensitivity to literary values and literary laws have allowed new shafts of light to fall on ancient problems. On the other hand the very mass of new informa- tion and above all the new viewpoints have raised new and severe challenges too. Currently these challenges are met on an ad hoc basis. Articles and even books devote themselves to this problem or to that. What is typology? Is there a sensus plenior ? What is sacred history? What is historicity? What is inspiration? What is instrumental causality? What is myth? Is sensus a generic or an analogous notion? - It is not often, if anywhere, noticed that a much broader issue is involved, running beneath all the ad hoc issues. The issue is whether there is somewhere a philosophic starting-place that offers a consistent illumination for all the ad hoc issues. Scripture students implicitly are searching for such a starting-place, though they seem reluctant to admit it explicitly. The present note is an effort to make explicit, first, the fact of the philosophic issue and the unadmitted concern about it; second, the sug- gestion of a possible avenue of explicit advance; third, a consideration based on Fr. McKenzie's The Two-Edged Sword 1 of where Scripture studies now stand, relative to this advance. 1. Nature of the Basic Problem First, then, the fact of the philosophic issue. Fr. Bouyer2 has pointed out that the roots of the Protestant divergence from Catholicism are not so much theological as philosophical; argument, if carried out charitably enough, soon gets back to the critical problems of knowledge and realism. Similarly it seems that in Scripture studies any argument carried out further than strict verbal exegesis soon exposes root-differences in philosophic understanding. Is there a sensus plenior ? Your answer depends a great deal on what you mean by "instrumental causality," "consciousness/' and "meaning."3 Are the gospels history? Your answer depends a great deal on what you mean by "history," "literary form," "author's intention," and on the criteria by which you com- pare known literary forms of ancient civilizations with other ancient or with modern forms.4 The newcomer to the field of Scripture studies may notice the existence of 1 (Milwaukee: Bruce, 1956). 2 The Spirit and Forms of Protestantism (Westminster: Newman, 1955). 3 Cf. C. H. Giblin, S.J., "As it is Written . . CBQ 20 (1958) 328f. 4 Cf.

Almost immediately, rival theories of "historicity/' "inspiration/' "meaning," "form," "myth," "intention," "type," and the like, are broached to him as interwoven in rival understandings of the texts. Experts in the field may be so engrossed in showing the rich possibilities of the texts that they do not notice how truly deep and preliminary, truly philosophic, the problems evoked usually are. They frequently begin by warning their students or readers against taking an inadequate un-literary philosophic stance that would block legitimate and verifiable understanding. Yet it may be that they have no unified and con- sistent philosophy to put in place of the un-literary one, and hence leave their students rudderless. They may excuse themselves by saying that philo- sophic questions are "Greek," yet in fact the issues they themselves broach are very deep and basic. Of course, there is one thing to clear up in this discussion from the very first. Philosophic does not mean a priori. Scripture students have a real, and understandable, fear of a priori rationalizing. They are so happy to be free of rationalism and to be able to reverence the texts for what they are, honestly, humbly, receptively, that they shudder at any stirring of rationalism's spectre. The philosophic problems of biblical literature are not solved first, in isolation, away from the text. They arise from the text, from the nature of the mind trying to understand the text, or from the demands of faith. They must finally be verifiable in the text, the laws of understanding, the data of faith. There is no place in present Scripture studies for airy speculating on philosophy; there is too much real work to do ; but much of this work involves pushing questions further and further to their roots. Another way of illustrating the philosophic nature of the basic problem might be to cite a remark of Fr. Jean Danielou, S. J., writing in a recent issue of Perspectives .5 Fr. Dani√©lou's remark notes the sympathy between biblical expression and existentialism. But would biblical theologians explicitly list themselves as existentialist in philosophy? Another way of asking the question may not be as clear, but is actually more telling. How great is the antithesis between an adequate interpretation of the Bible and an adequate philosophy? - between "Hebrew" and "Greek" mentality as it is usually said? The antithesis has always struck me as containing a half-truth, and one of great value, but also as serving the Scripture student as an escape from making explicit his own philosophic stance, whatever it may be. He need not give himself a name, or enlist in a given school. He ought not to hide from himself that he too has presuppositions which, if made explicit, would suffer the scrutiny and benefit of criticism. 2. Possible Avenue of Solution The second part of this note must attempt to express the goal at which the process of explicitation seems already to be tending. There seem to be three general types of question occupying the current attention of Scripture students. 6 (Notre Dame: Oct.-Nov. 1959, 9).</page><page sequence="3">308 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 22 (1) Fact : there are questions about manuscript, cultural, or archeological fact. (2) Meaning: there are questions about how to conceive the meaning of the text. (3) Verification : there are questions about how to verify the various proposed meanings. Then there are two other considerations which the student finds running through all three kinds of question. It is as though the three kinds of question moved on a horizontal plane, one leading to the other, and the two new con- siderations moved vertically through each. The added two considerations are: (4) Development in Knowledge; and (5) Development in Expression : the creation of new concepts, the coining of new words and even of new literary genres. The student learns very swiftly that all five of these aspects interact, one upon the other. New facts invite new meanings, and meanings undergo elaboration until they are verifiable against the facts. New meanings some- times suggest search for new facts. And sometimes the development of new ideas is hinted at before there is a corresponding development in expression to allow explicitation. The field of Scripture studies is thus highly complex and delicate. If an interpretation is taken for a fact, or if stages of development in insight are overlooked, or if the birth of a new expression is taken too incautiously as the birth of a totally new idea, distortion and error will arise. Experts are careful to observe these five aspects, even though they may not be careful to explicitate them. But the significant thing about these five aspects is that while they are divergent, and fan outwards as if to respect the delicacy and complexity of the data, they nevertheless spring from a point of unity. Together they attempt to prepare the mind for respectful understand- ing. Each marks a step in relation to full and correct understanding. It seems that if there is any fact fruitful as a starting-place for a philosophy of literature, it is the fact that men do understand one another across ages, and cultures, and languages. The fact of understanding is the fruitful one because it precisely is the point of unity among men. Communicants may belong to a different time and culture, and speak a different language; what they have in common is understanding, though each would attain it in his own way. Some examples may not be out of place. The decrees of the Church Councils express doctrine in increasingly abstract language (and in Latin), differing from the expression but not the meaning of Holy Scripture. The very effort of Scripture study means understanding now, today, what admittedly was written by Hebrew authors in Hebrew terms for Hebrew audiences (until of course parts of the New Testament began to aim at the Gentiles too or, if you will, until the Septuagint translation). Again, even for the purposes of international collaboration in our own age, or in any other, Scripture studies must aim at a transcultural understanding. In spite of the fact that we in modern America do not use the Hebrew tongue, or even</page><page sequence="4">Miscellanea Biblica 309 share many of the daily experiences of the ancient Hebrew people, or have minds and imaginations formed by the same forces, still there must be some- thing that leaps through Scripture from their culture into ours, and into the European, and the African, and Eastern. This something, which offers a point of union for the whole human race, and which yet is capable of almost infinite approaches and has many guiding aspects, is the act of understanding. What are the virtuosities of the act of understanding? It is an act most unforced and natural, which all men like to share; rare and inconsiderable would be the man who admitted that he never understands. Again, one compliment men seldom refuse is: "I see you already understand!" Perhaps if there were to be any activity that cut across various cultures in a specifically human way, understanding would be the one. Similarly in Scripture studies. No expert in the field, no novice either, will take it as derogatory in the slightest if he is told he understands what he is dealing with. Biblical theologians would probably accept without struggle the observation that their whole effort - all three types of their questions, each in its own way - is to understand the Word of God for what it is. Furthermore, it is probably more than acceptable to state that God understands what He revealed. Men may argue the how and the degree , but no one will argue the fact that the human authors of Scripture understood what they intended by their words. Scholars are compared by the degree to which they are thought to understand the Sacred Texts, or by their achievements in opening up ways toward that understanding. It is said that the saints, people of whatever station, understand the Word of God, taught by the Spirit in the Spirit's own ways and methods. - If there is one thing that is transcultural, and both sufficiently unifying and sufficiently various, it is the activity of understanding. Scriptural students are not so interested in proving, or in speculating, or in conceiving or thinking; they are very much concerned about understanding. All their concern about literary form follows from their concern about understanding; one is the expression of the other; so with their concern about archeology and the rest. The drive to understand is the starting-place of Scripture studies, and their standard and test is how well the drive has been satisfied. Understanding has its own laws. It flows, after all, from the human mind - something as universal as the race, and operative in all truly human action. So it does seem possible that there be a truly transcultural philosophy, respect- ful of all the modes and moods of human understanding and its expression - respectful too of evolution and development. If hermeneutics became aware of these laws, it would have universal criteria against which to compare itself. Scriptural studies would be seen against the other activities of human under- standing, and it would be easier for students to scrutinize their anticipations in passing from one activity to another. Incidentally, too, the close relation- ships of Scripture studies with other literary studies would also become more apparent, with much more interaction, perhaps, between biblical students and students of secular literary criticism - the splendid essays of T. S. Eliot,</page><page sequence="5">310 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 22 Wimsatt, and others flowing one way, and those of the theologians on myth, intention, and the like, flowing the other. Understanding, as an activity, is various. Occurring just before conception (it is the act or flash of insight from which the concept proceeds), it is very difficult to define directly. Men know when they understand, and know how to distinguish those who understand quickly from those who are dull; but understanding itself is elusive. It occurs in many forms, through many vicissitudes; some methods favor it; many things - prejudices, biases, false anticipations - hinder it. Acts of understanding are linked to one another in many ways too: sometimes they are merely successive, as when one gets several ideas one after the other. Sometimes they are unifying of all that went before : as when one sees how many successive ideas possess, perhaps from a higher point of view, a striking unity. Understandings have many relation- ships to expression too. Poetry, symbolic action, scientific essay, metaphor, story, factual inventory: the human mind is very fertile in finding ways to express what it understands. Sometimes the ways of expression are limited by the understanding: as when a child, who cannot talk, gestures; or when an ordinary man tries to express his untrained grasp of a technical point. At other times, the mind chooses one among many methods that it knows, for the purpose at hand: as when a skilled scientist invents a metaphor or story to get his point across to beginners. This is not the place to develop even an outline of the flexibility of a philosophy pivoted on understanding. Its transcultural value is obvious. Its flexibility gives it safeguards against rationalism. Its whole inner orientation prevents it from distorting or forcing the objects which it studies; for it loses its whole raison d'etre if it stops even for a moment trying to understand. It can move up and down the whole range of specifically human activity, for that activity inevitably involves some mode or other of human understanding. And for that matter, it is opened outwards toward the whole universe, since the universe too is there to be understood by men for what it is, to the highest degree of which men are capable of understanding it in their given stage of history. It seems, finally, that this sort of approach is what Bernard Lonergan, S.J., had in mind when he wrote : "The . . . act of understanding ... is not any recondite intuition but the familiar event that occurs easily and frequently in the moderately intelligent, rarely and with difficulty only in the very stupid. In itself it is so simple and obvious that it seems to merit the little attention that commonly it receives. At the same time, its function in cognitional activity is so central that to grasp it in its conditions, its working, and its results, is to confer a basic yet startling unity on the whole field of human inquiry and opinion."6 It seems that Fr. Lonergan has taken the first steps in working towards a 6 Insight : A Study of Human Understanding (New York: Philosophical Library, 1957) ix.</page><page sequence="6">Miscellanea Biblica 311 transcultural philosophy. That is why his chapters on mystery and myth ( Insight , 513f.) and on hermeneutics (586f.) seem especially relevant for shedding light on the preliminaries and presuppositions of biblical studies. In working out this philosophy, a great deal of work remains to be done, especially on the techniques and methods on the proximate level, as consistent with the laws of understanding Fr. Lonergan has dealt with on the remote level. Were this work undertaken, biblical theology would have a programme for explicat- ing from top to bottom, from starting place to goal, its inner drive, hope, and guiding criteria. 3 . Understanding the Bible But it is not enough, of course, to point out a possible avenue of advance. It is also necessary to establish where we are relative to that advance. For this attempt, we might comfortably choose The Two-Edged Sword by Fr. John L. McKenzie, S. J., both because it is at hand, somewhat as a standard American reference point, and because it attempts a single whole view of the OT : it is, avowedly, "an interpretation of the Old Testament." Fr. McKenzie's book is a popularization, it does not attempt a full explanation of his every argument. For all that, its philosophical implications will show up more thoroughly. The exigencies of writing for the general reader force him to take the view of outsiders coming upon the field of Scripture studies; technical discussions, complicated arguments, must be reduced to the general lines of one consistent reasonable attitude. Very well, then, where is the pivotal point of this attitude, its center, its starting-place? What philosophic presuppositions, concomitants, and consequents does it imply ? To judge by the disjunctions on which Fr. McKenzie dwells in his first five chapters, the key to understanding the Bible for what it is is the awareness that Scripture studies are something different from other studies. "One must, as well as one can, put aside one's mental baggage to read these ancient books with intelligence and sympathy" (p. 12). Fr. McKenzie sets the Bible against philosophy and science (p. 20), he relates magic and myth to science and philosophy (p. SO), he converts concrete Semitic imagery into modern abstract statements (p. 54), he contrasts the modern idea of history with Hebrew story-telling (p. 60f.), and, apparently, the Greek discovery of history (p. 62) with the Hebrew discovery (p. 64f.). It is remarkable that Fr. McKenzie does not dwell on the fact that these same disjunctions, mutatis mutandis , can be made in preparation for the study of literature of any period or of any culture.7 His failure to do so seems indicative of the narrow front on which Scripture studies in general prefer to advance. Students of Scripture prefer to see their crucial problem as a difference between "Hebrew mentality" and Greek-modern mentality, rather than in the broad terms of pre-conceptual8 knowledge and expression in which Jacques Maritain, say, in Creative 7 Fr. McKenzie makes passing references to the fact. He does not make it central. 8 "Experiential" might sound less pejorative than "pre-conceptual."</page><page sequence="7">312 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 22 Intuition in Art and Poetry ,9 conceives the relationships of East and West, art and logic. They do not seem aware that professors of modern literature find it as hard to make scholastically trained students appreciate the modern novel without moralizing and logicizing it, as they have in making these same students appreciate Scripture. Fr. McKenzie, then, advances on the problems of Scripture without ad- vertence to the similar problems raised on the whole wide front of human culture. Still, on the whole, he may very well be solving his particular view of the problems in a way that, if generalized, would stand as an adequate and realistic philosophy. There are four positions that Fr. McKenzie takes in the early part of The Two-Edged Sword which may help to illustrate the lines of the philosophy to which he seems to be inclined. First, he accepts, however tentatively,10 some relationship between myth and philosophy: one is, ap- parently, but a more inchoate form of the other (p. 50). If this is so, then myth and philosophy are but two different modes of structuring man's ex- perience of existence, and there can possibly be communication between these modes. Perhaps the same thing can be understood in the two different ways. Secondly, Fr. McKenzie translates the Semitic cultic myth into abstract propositions (p. 54) and in fact claims as his own Plato's definition of myth as "an imaginative representation of abstract truth" (p. 86). Myth therefore seems to involve an imagistic form of expression, where philosophy, presumably, involves a more rigorous and abstract expression. It is possible to translate more or less adequately from one to the other. ... In short, Fr. McKenzie seems to see myth and philosophy not only as related modes of understanding, but also as related modes of expression. Thirdly, Fr. McKenzie takes the position that history is the "remembered past," and attributes the discovery of history to both Greeks and Hebrews in differing but not very clear ways (pp. 62-65). He does not have occasion, given the nature of his book, to contrast Greek cyclic notions of history with modern notions,11 nor to indicate the influence of Hebrew notions upon St. Augustine and thence upon modern notions. He links modern notions much more strongly to the Greeks, and he does not notice, for example, that quasi- modern concepts like "Renaissance" (indeed a holdover from Greek cyclicism) are as obsolete as mechanist materialism and encyclopedic rationalism. Modern evolutionary theory is much more consonant with the Hebrew-Christian con- sciousness of continuity and direction. ... In short, Fr.' McKenzie's treatment suffers from his polemic against a "modern idea of history" that is already vanishing. 9 (New York: Meridian, 1955). 10 Fr. McKenzie elaborates his notion of myth in "Myth and the Old Testament," CBQ 21 (1959) 265-282. 11 Cf. Walter J. Ong, S.J., "Cyclicism and Evolution," Thought 34 (1959) 547-569, and Hannah Arendt, "The Modern Concept of History," The Review of Politics 20 (1958) 570-590.</page><page sequence="8">Miscellanea Biblica 313 Fourthly, there is implicit in the very treatment of the OT as a unity that can be interpreted in some one general view a whole ream of positions on the nature of human tradition and development, on understanding and ex- pression as both genetic and dialectic. To read the NT as "the best com- mentary on the Old" (p. 307), to point out how the language of the NT grew from the language of the Old (p. 304), and even how the ideas of the New depended on the history and lessons of the Old (pp. 304-5), is to take a view that seems strikingly similar to that taken in T. S. Elio≈•s famous essay "Tradition and the Individual Talent."12 As Newman wrote of a "Development of Doctrine," so Fr. McKenzie traces the development of Hebrew ideas of life and death from Mesopotamian myth through the psalms and Job and Isaia to St. Paul (pp. 249f.). What is the general line of Fr. McKenzie's philosophical position then? It is that communication is possible with the mind of ancient Hebrew writers. It is that from the dead ink on old manuscripts, from words, Fr. McKenzie believes that our intelligences can be fired with the understanding the ancient Hebrews had of the experience of human life. Do not believe that this is trivial. If, as Fr. McKenzie stresses, the Hebrews used different words than we, conceived meaning differently, had even different experiences than we, then what can be the handle of communication? Mediating between words, concepts, images, and experience there must be something . But not every philosophy can find it. A conceptualist philosophy pivots on the concept; I believe this is what Fr. McKenzie attributes to "philosophy." He implies (p. 20) that philosophy is interested in words, not things; that it is of "fine intellectual speculations and elegant theorizing"; that it erects a wall between God and man. All these things may be true of a rationalism which thinks that intelligere is forming a concept, and that knowledge is seeing abstract relationships. Such a rationalism easily becomes an academicism, an exercise in deduction and logic, and a tyrant over literary (and other art) forms, of which it desires a conceptual clarity they are not designed to yield. A conceptualist philosophy is not the sort of thing to which Fr. McKenzie is inclined; but neither will an existentialist philosophy serve him well. Phe- nomenology can handle only experiences. It makes its adherents sensitive to the shades and force of experience; it detects hidden riches in the study of the concrete, and in the differences in the discrete. All this is a great benefit, and an exegete of Scripture, close to a people who thought concretely and spoke in poignant images, can hardly help feeling a certain kinship with phenomenological method. But phenomenology is not so adequate for com- municating across the ages, or even across different cultures in the same age. Concrete words "lose something" in translation. Besides, when it has scanned all there is of experiences, the human mind is not yet ready to rest; it begins scrutinizing more and more accurately the relationships and unities 12 Cf. also, Josef Pieper, "The Concept of Tradition," The Review of Politics 20 (1958) 465-491.</page><page sequence="9">314 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 22 within experiences. It begins to seek, say, the meaning of God in terms not anthropomorphic and involving us, but in terms as proper as possible for expressing what He is in Himself. Thus I would say that Fr. McKenzie 's unspecified polemic against philosophy has cost him in clarity. Some philosophies do avoid critical reflection upon a given text (even if the text happens to be from St. Thomas) by repeating the words of the text, and not debating and verifying their meaning . Such philosophies lead easily to fundamentalism. Other philosophies flee meaning except in its most concrete and experiential components. Fr. McKenzie on the other hand has taken a more promising position, one that would relate words to understanding and to reality in a fashion suited to transcultural com- munication. Since he has not been explicit about what he has done, it seems that his choice must be credited to his good sense and respect for the fulness of his task rather than to philosophical acuity. But also since he has not been explicit on what he has done, it is difficult for the student to get his hands on the starting-place of Fr. McKenzie's position concerning myth, ex- pression, history, tradition and the like. Again, Fr. McKenzie's lack of explicitness makes it difficult for the man who would like to climb from fundamentalism to Fr. McKenzie's position. If it is fundamentalism to cling to words, what criteria does one use in leaping from words to understanding? Do all understandings correspond to the words and, more, to reality? The most difficult question of all arises. Why does Fr. McKenzie say that the Bible has "a firm grip on reality" (p. 20) ? Is reality what we know by sense knowledge or concrete images? Are material things then more real than spiritual? Take it another way. Is reality concrete - are things really what they seem to the senses ? Or is reality an intelligibility, "a spiritual reality," different from what meets the sensual eye? Did the Hebrews have a "grip on reality" because of their concrete thought patterns? Because of the "eye of the spiritual man"? How was their vision verified in experience, escaping the figments of mythic imagination and gripping the really real? For valid communication to take place across the centuries all these lurking questions must be faced. Otherwise, humanly speaking, we are in effect rudderless among words, conceptions, images, genres, the abstract formulations of the Councils, other fields of thought, our daily lives. If all of these can be unified, Scripture indeed will have great effect. If all of these are to be unified, a starting-place most acutely chosen and developed seems the first and pressing object of research. Michael Novak New York City</page></plain_text>
