<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Nature’s Transcendental Creativity:   Deleuze, Corrington, and an Aesthetic Phenomenology leon niemoczynski / immaculata university I. Introduction: Natura Naturata and Natura Naturans ecstatic naturalism believes that a rich conceptualization of nature should emphasize the reality of a basic ontological difference between a ground that is responsible for generating the world and the encompassing yet  incarnate processes of the world. The ontological difference mentioned here is  a difference between “nature naturing” (natura naturans) and “nature natured”  (natura naturata).1 ecstatic naturalism takes seriously the difference between  nature naturing and nature natured because it is a philosophy that recognizes  nature’s immanent or incarnate processes of semiotic generation as well as the  reality of nature’s transcendental generative ground (a ground that “natures”  via sign processes).2 Thus, ecstatic naturalism is a philosophy with a capacious  view of nature because it attempts to leave nothing out in its account of what is  real, including the immanent, the transcendent, and the reality of an ontological  difference between the immanent and the transcendent. for ecstatic naturalism,  then, nature as a whole—the immanent, the transcendent, and the difference  between—should not be interpreted to be a thing but must be said, rather, to  be an encompassing reality whose dimensions include creativity and process  (naturing naturing) but also what is created and actual (nature natured). more  simply put: the reality of nature is “whatever is, in whatever way.”3  for ecstatic naturalism, nature naturing represents a divine reality only in  the sense that it is an “ungrounded ground” [Abgrund], that is, nature naturing  is a transcendental or “ultimate” condition of  nature’s very own processive  becoming, which is articulated in the products of nature natured. This means  that nature naturing is a continual beginning point for cosmic development  1. robert s. corrington, Ecstatic Naturalism: Signs of the World (bloomington: indiana  university Press, 1994), xi, 7. 2. robert s. corrington, A Semiotic Theory of Theology and Philosophy (cambridge: cam- bridge university Press, 2000), 223. 3.

Whitehead earlier in this century knew something of this  when he cited the line, “the stars, they blindly run.” but corrington draws  out the impersonality with greater thoroughness than did Whitehead who  held to a personal god moved to poetic extravagance. . . .[c]orrington finds  the last word to . . . belong to a vast impersonal world and to its infinite  creative ground [nature naturing].6 due to the impersonal nature of nature naturing, one must be apprehensive  in delineating any specifically personal or pleasing human traits upon its face  when one addresses it as a divine ground. for corrington, it is important that,  4. robert s. corrington, “deep Pantheism,” Journal for the Study of Religion, Nature and  Culture 1, no. 4 (2007): 505. 5. for corrington’s statement of his similarities to and differences from both process theism  (neoclassical theism) and classical theism, see robert s. corrington, “Toward a Transforma- tion of neoclassical Theism,” International Philosophical Quarterly 27, no. 4 (1987): 393–95. 6. robert corrington, Nature’s Religion (lanham, md: rowman &amp; littlefield, 1997), xiv–xv.

Whatever the ultimate nature of this divine ground, nature’s  “primal self” encompasses the beautiful and the demonic, the personal and  the impersonal, the human and the nonhuman alike.  With the impersonal nature of  this ground in mind, my intention here is to  point out an alternative method that does not exclusively emphasize the hu- man psyche in order to comprehend the hidden and elusive aspects of  nature  naturing. it is my view that corrington’s method of psychosemiotic analytical  query may be too susceptible to a form of hermeneutic distortion while reading  categories of the human psyche into the categories of nature—a nature whose  categories may be entirely indifferent to the human. While i cannot say that  i disagree with corrington’s critique of  theism’s reading of  a pleasing human  face upon deity, i question the extent to which a human-centered method  such as psychoanalysis (and corrington’s semiotic addendum to psychoanaly- sis—psychosemiotics—or the use of  psychoanalysis within the wider light of  semiotics) is able to reveal key ontological features of  nature’s divine ground  in such a way that that revelation is free from human conceptual import and  hermeneutic distortion. if  we are to refrain from reading a human face upon  deity, we may wish to consider whether it is wise to read a human face (in the  form of the psychoanalytic categories) upon nature at large. Thus, i propose a  method other than corrington’s psychoanalytic-semiotic method for coming  to terms with nature’s sustaining, and thus divine, character. situated within  a broader perspective that i choose to call “speculative naturalism” (related  to but distinct from “ecstatic naturalism”), i describe my approach as a “phe- nomenological aesthetic” of  nature. unlike psychosemiotics, my approach  does not interrogate natura naturans psychoanalytically.7 II. Psychoanalysis and Semiotics corrington’s method of metaphysical query involves the reading of psychose- miotic material that is dialectically generated from within a presemiotic, pre- formal framework. This reading draws upon psychoanalysts such as carl Jung,  sigmund freud, Julia Kristeva, and luce irigaray, to name but a few. for  corrington, psychoanalysis establishes a guise from within which one allows  7.

Put differently, being  a “non-located” location and “measureless” (nature is no “thing” but a process),  nature prevails as a clearing within which all prehuman and human orders find  meaning.9 no one order of nature, no one creature, must be privileged.  With this capacious view of nature in the background, corrington’s variety  of ecstatic naturalism does state that psychoanalysis in particular is a preferred  method of choice. he writes, “Psychoanalysis belongs to ecstatic naturalism as  one of its own dimensions of understanding. The contour of the human process  remains elusive, but some insight can be gained into its semiotic rhythms when  a judicious use is made of the categories that promise to break through the  8. ecstatic naturalism’s relationship to psychoanalysis is vast and complex. see corrington,  Semiotic Theory, 87–88; corrington, Ecstatic Naturalism: Signs of the World, 10–12; and  robert s. corrington, Riding the Windhorse: Manic Depressive Disorder and the Quest for  Wholeness (lanham, md: hamilton books, 2003). 9. corrington, Nature and Spirit, 8.

All methods are phenomenological in that they wish  to listen to the traits of the world and to find a place for them in an expand- ing articulation.”12 overall, a phenomenology informed by psychoanalysis is,  for corrington, defined as “the sensitive exploration of traits as they become  manifest within and as orders of relevance.”13  despite corrington identifying a plurality of methods available to the specula- tive philosopher and his being at great pains to distance himself from the charge  of anthropocentrism, one finds reference to deep human needs and psychopathol- ogy within his psychosemiotic method. for example, with respect to psychopa- thology, we are told that nature “‘uses’ certain forms of [psychological] illness to  advance species interests. . . . The most intimate statistical correlation is between  genius and manic-depressive disorder (for example, newton).”14 metaphysics, we  are told, must be a way of dealing with psychopathology and is in some sense  always an expression of it.15 Thus, for corrington, it is customary to speak of  “psychopathology” as much it is to speak of the metaphysics of the natural  world. in sum, “The terms and distinctions that have become compelling in  psychoanalytic forms of semiotics are of great value when stretched beyond their  normal sphere of use to open up dimensions of the unconscious of nature.”16 10. corrington, Ecstatic Naturalism, 12. 11. corrington, Semiotic Theory, 87–88. corrington’s indebtedness to buchler may be found  in Nature’s Perspectives: Prospects for Ordinal Metaphysics, ed. robert s. corrington, Kath- leen Wallace and Armen marsoobian (Albany: suny Press, 1991); see the coauthored  introduction and corrington’s “ordinality and the divine natures,” 347–66 in that volume. 12. corrington, Ecstatic Naturalism, 14. 13. ibid. 14. corrington, Semiotic Theory, 35. 15. ibid. 16. robert s. corrington, “nature’s god and the return of the material maternal” The  American Journal of Semiotics 10, no. 1/2 (1993): 117.

Put differently, “The growth of mystery is correlated to the presence of  the  archetypes that can never be exhausted by human apprehension.”19 if  the  origin of sign generation remains a mystery, even after attempting to access  that origin through the subconscious, how is psychoanalysis taken to be a key  in the process? What is it that psychoanalysis would reveal? III. Semiotics and Virtual Nature in A Semiotic Theory of Theology and Philosophy, corrington claims that a  robust naturalism has as its best choice for an ontology of signs the sort of  semiotic cosmology that is found within the Peircean architectonic.20 cor- rington addresses Peirce’s insufficiencies and settles for a Peircean ontology  of the sign while focusing on the sign’s subaltern configuration as well as its  self-othering aspect (the fact that it is always permeable to something other  than its self  and its own prospects, lost or gained). he concludes that nature  naturing (as denoted by the term “precategorial” and “subaltern”) is not itself   a sign; its intelligibility is presemiotic and so remains opaque to any direct  phenomenological (and here i would add conceptual) description.  Approached elliptically, a “virtual” sign procession is detectable in the sense  that signs, via qualitative feeling, “balance, reinforce, and challenge each other”  17. corrington, Ecstatic Naturalism, 192. 18. ibid. 19. ibid., 195. 20. corrington, Semiotic Theory, 89.

The caveat is that it seems impossible to access the generation of  21. ibid., 91. 22. see for example, robert s. corrington, The Community of Interpreters: On the Herme- neutics of Nature and the Bible in the American Philosophical Tradition (macon, georgia:  mercer university Press, 1987). 23. corrington, Semiotic Theory, 41. 24.

This means that nature naturing is always revealed via other  events, via other signs: terms always other than itself, in a series of sign-ings  that never represent first terms but only terms of mediation; in the context of  discussion, a human reading of natural sign processes is always the ultimate  mediating condition.25 The question becomes: can the human exist, or better,  exist and interpret such a signed existence without projection? is it possible to  read “between” or “within” nature’s orders, its signs, in order to access directly  natura naturans behind sign generation: a prehension of the actualization of  nature’s orders from their very source and ground of potential?  Appealing to a form of metaphysical realism common to the medieval phi- losophers, corrington asserts that there may be origins of traits that are not  fully semiotic. These are found virtually within any semiotic object (what cor- rington calls an “order of the world”) and are not completely exhausted by the  reach of interpreters. Thus there subsists dormant within the depths of any  created object an untouched origin of potential sign generation. stated another  way, the origins of semiotic traits subsist within any order of nature such that  any order is naturally complex, being infinite in its potential for interpretation.26  These nonsemiotic traits arise from within the “underconscious” of  nature  primarily via “feeling tones” or presentations of qualitative immediacy. The  source of potential signification is not yet fully semiotic yet is still capable, in  potential, of being presented to conscious experience for interpretation. cor- rington identifies this as the virtually semiotic. corrington writes: “The grand  canyon does not ‘know’ that it is a sign itself, but that does not make it any  less so. The gas cloud remnant from a supernova does not ‘know’ that it is its  signs of violent explosion, but it is so regardless. it is anthropocentric prejudice  that signs must be known [or actuated] to be such by a form of awareness. . . .  Again, an order of relevance [nature natured] can be presemiotic (insofar as it  participates in the underconscious of nature), actually semiotic (insofar as it  is a sign of itself), and virtually semiotic (insofar as it has semiotic traits that  can be further actualized by a sign-using self).”27  What is being sought from the virtuality of the sign is nature naturing’s depth  dimension, the “whence that propels projections outward into the world.”28  25. corrington, Semiotic Theory, 173. 26. ibid., 175. 27. ibid. 28. ibid.

IV. The Problem of Hermeneutic Distortion and a Suggested  Alternative to Corrington’s Method The task of delving beneath the prominent social nature of psychic repression  to reach preformal semiotic content is a difficult one. not only is one caught  in the position of seeking to go beyond human projection, one is caught in a  social matrix of projection from which there seems to be no immediate release.  corrington’s appeal to the depth-psychologist’s position—a position that affirms  a categorical-ontological approach to psychic repression in order to bypass a  strictly individuated psychosocial analysis of the human being—is indeed a fa- miliar move. Although corrington has worked with depth psychology (to attain  to features beyond personal psychic expression) as well as semiotic cosmology  (to attain to those features’ universal ontological-cosmological properties), he  has not yet chosen to invoke a formal transcendental method capable of un- covering the virtual ground responsible for the actualization of psychosemiotic  content and its corresponding generative creative process. corrington’s mistake,  it appears, is that psychosemiotics, ultimately, always references specifically hu- man complexes and traits even though it is possible to invoke transcendental  categories that do not explicitly reference human psychic traits and relationships.  With respect to psychosemiotics and the virtual depth dimension of  any  sign’s meaning, it must be noted that it is corrington and the french philoso- pher gilles deleuze who share a common critique of freudian psychoanalytic  theory (as opposed to Jung), namely, that while human generativity is libidinal  and pro-creative (Eros), it is ultimately finite (Thanatos).30 in my judgment,  this positions a theory of the divine nearby because with a finite and infinite  distinction comes the understanding that the infinite is a primal source for all  generativity—the ultimate unconditioned ground of being that is the unlimited  source of semiotic meaning production. in a very unique way, this uncondi- tioned ground could be identified as “deity” where, traditional psychoanalysis,  29. ibid., 47. 30. robert s. corrington, “infinitizing Psychoanalysis,” in Proceedings of the Korean Lacan  Society.Meeting jointly with the 5th International Whitehead Conference (new york: fordham  university Press, 2004): 23–24.

As corrington  puts it, “since its formal inception in the 1880s psychoanalysis has been in  flight from the infinite. . . . Put more starkly, one can say that the unfolding of  the psychoanalytic perspective was itself  an abjection or radical denial of the  elusive pulsations of a self-giving infinite momentum.”31  in the end, for corrington (and for deleuze), freud remains bound to an  ego-style psychology that privileges the centrality of  an ego yet ignores the  infinite, failing to balance the ego with its ontologically founding conditions  of infinite sign generation. Thus, corrington suggests that another method is  needed, one that avoids the ego-centered (anthropocentric) and even linguistic  trappings of a social-psychical scheme utterly divorced from “nature, history,  and the objective foundations of the human process.”32 for corrington, the  method of “psychosemiotics” deals with “all forms of signification, the lin- guistic being but a species within the genus of a natural semiotics that deals  with all forms of sign use within the innumerable worlds that surround and  enter into the human process.”33 This seems to be to his credit in attempting  to disavow anthropocentrism.  in sharp distinction to freud, corrington’s psychosemiotics has as its sub- ject matter (four) “modes of the infinite” and approaches theism as much as it  does philosophical naturalism. With its goal of opening the providing space  of nature naturing that enables sign processes, his method “is a way of being  that emerges from the true depth of the human process and represents the how  of  the self ’s journey from its armoring into the infinite that it was, is, and will  be. . . . [semiotic] psychoanalysis works through recollection to coax the self   back to its ungrounded ground, its true origin in the ocean of the infinite.”34 it  is a process of recollection different in kind from the recollection that “devotes  itself  to breaking through the resistance of denial in order to gain access to  pre-oedipal and oedipal traumas.”35  despite corrington’s admonition, and even when using the ordinal phe- nomenological approach, psychosemiotics comes dangerously close to the  sort of  anthropocentrism that it seeks to avoid. crippled by the dangerous  and frightening powers of  the infinite, the human psyche flees within itself  31. ibid. 32. ibid., 28. 33. ibid. 34. ibid., 32–33. 35. ibid., 32.

And finally, if  nature is pansemiotic, then the  semiotic contents of  nature's naturing’s momenta should be available for  phenomenological inspection within externally manifested orders of  nature,  other forms of  life, and other expressions of  unconscious momentum dis- played in sign generation, not just from within the inner world of  the human  psyche (and especially not as a manifest private self  as opposed to nature’s  broader “public” self).36 While corrington identifies what he calls “sacred  folds” (a metaphor for meaningful events or places which are “folded back”  within the natural world and thus which house a density of  semiotic mean- ing), these “folds” seem to require human beings in order to unleash “strong  unconscious complexes.”37 And again, distortion is the issue, as corrington  notes that we are apt to see the “wave” of  meaning unleashed by the fold as  “something other than what it is.”38  given the reasons presented above, let me now turn to another phenom- enological method that also attempts to use a fundamentally speculative yet  metaphysically realist approach designed to engage natura naturans. This sort  of approach, i think, is also present in the speculative, and to some degree, in a  very qualified sense, phenomenological philosophy of gilles deleuze, especially  as it is found in works such as Bergsonism, Difference and Repetition, The Logic  of Sense, and The Fold: Leibniz and the Baroque.39 on my view, this approach  is a phenomenological aesthetic, where the sort of aesthetics involved seems less  susceptible to some of the criticisms leveled at corrington’s own psychosemiotic  approach. To develop what i am calling an “aesthetic phenomenology,” i shall  draw on some ideas similar to ecstatic naturalism that are found in the ontology  of gilles deleuze, specifically his analysis of the virtual and its relationship to  the category of creativity. 36. nguyen, Nature’s Primal Self, 5, 135–37, 139–40. 37. corrington, Nature’s Religion, 29. 38. ibid. 39. gilles deleuze, Bergsonism, trans. hugh Tomlinson and barbara habberjam (new york:  zone books, 1988); deleuze, Difference and Repetition, trans.

Transcendental Creativity: Nature’s Generative Conditions on deleuze’s view, presemiotic “lines of  flight” (potentials for meaning, or  what deleuze calls “singularities”) emerge from beneath layers of  meaning  stratification in a manner that tends toward the least amount of resistance.40 in  slightly different language, “singularities” emerge from nature’s ground as from  a “dark precursor,” according to a path where they are least affected by some  other projection; this in order to exhibit the greatest amount of their own pre- semiotic content.41 This presemiotic content first appears through what i shall  now refer to as “feeling” or “intensity” (for strict conceptualization remains  on the plane of human projection). As singularities appear, nature naturing’s  own processive, generative, and creative ground manifests a nonvisible but  qualitatively felt momentum that gives itself  over to various agents who in turn  may communicate that momentum in a process of semiosis. Although deleuze  does distance himself from a phenomenology of the husserlian variety, he does  nevertheless embrace a radically empirical and phenomenological notion of  how this momentum is to be felt, described, and understood.42  deleuze’s metaphysics engages the becoming of singularities in such a way  that it is possible to shy away from psychoanalysis and embrace instead a sort  of transcendental analysis directly aimed at the conditions responsible for cre- ating “the plane of immanence” (roughly equal to corrington’s “orders of the  40. gilles deleuze and felix guattari, A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia,  trans. brian massumi (minneapolis: university of minnesota Press, 1983), 88–89. 41. deleuze’s terminology can appear strange to someone reading him for the first time. To  make matters worse, deleuze changes his terminology in every one of his books. like hei- degger, deleuze creates terminology in order to push thinking to its limits. in efforts to assist  the reader of this article, i will reference manuel delanda’s Intensive Science and Virtual  Philosophy, whose “Appendix: deleuze’s Words” offers explanations of deleuze’s various  terms. The “dark precursor” references the depth of spatium in which intensities are orga- nized. deleuze also refers to this dark precursor as “the body without organs” in A Thousand  Plateaus as well as the “ideal or metaphysical surface” in The Logic of Sense. see manuel  delanda, Intensive Science and Virtual Philosophy (new york: continuum, 2009), 203. 42. The relationship of deleuze to phenomenology is vexing. According to a review of Joe  hughes’s Deleuze and the Genesis of Representation—a book which argues for the compat- ibility between deleuze and phenomenology—“the problem appears to consist in a kind of  contradiction between deleuze’s explicit statements about phenomenology and his implicit  affinity for its methods and inclinations. on the one hand, in interviews and recollections,  deleuze consistently describes his own entry into the milieu of academic philosophy against  the dominant landscape of  phenomenology. . . . but on the other hand, and despite his  seeming antagonism, deleuze consistently expresses his admiration for phenomenology  and, more particularly, a number of its partisans, including sartre, hippolyte, Wahl, and  merleau-Ponty.” see gregory flaxman and Abe geil, review of Deleuze and the Genesis of  Representation, by Joe hughes, Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews (April 9, 2010), http:// ndpr.nd.edu/news/24327-deleuze-and-the-genesis-of-representation/ (accessed August 2012).

As deleuze writes in The Logic of  Sense, “Aesthetics . . . designates the theory of sensibility as the form of possible  experience; on the other hand, it designates the theory of art as the reflection  of real experience. for these two meanings to be tied together, the conditions  of experience in general must become conditions of real experience.”46  it is important to note that concepts do not merely “represent” the momen- tum and habits of the “dark precursor” that generates immanence. rather, the  concept belongs to nature’s transcendental ground as part of its very mode of  actualization even though, empirically, the concept may not resemble what it  creates.47 deleuze writes that with concepts, one is able to prehend the virtual  as “an impersonal and pre-individual transcendental field, which does not re- semble the corresponding empirical fields. . . . This field can not be determined  as that of a consciousness.”48 The key point is that these concepts are not de- rived from human psychical momenta but rather represent nature’s own novel  becoming. Thus, rather than appearing from the depths of the human psyche,  the shape of  immanence is “in-formed” by concepts generated by the tran- scendental field, or what would be roughly equivalent to corrington’s natura  naturans. interestingly, deleuze, in The Logic of Sense, titles the transcendental  field “Aion” or ho aion, from the archaic αἰϝών, meaning both “unmanifested  deity” and “eternity,” the “becoming of the depths. . . . The becoming which  divides itself  infinitely in past and future and always eludes the present.”49 43. deleuze and guatarri, A Thousand Plateaus, 70. 44. gilles deleuze and felix guatarri, What is Philosophy? trans. hugh Tomlinson and  graham burchell (new york: columbia university Press, 1994), 164. 45. deleuze and guatarri, What is Philosophy? 7. 46. deleuze, The Logic of Sense, 260. 47. ibid., 102. 48. ibid. 49. ibid., 5.

As a “quasi-cause,” the virtual subsists  more like a power or tendency rather than a determination. deleuze writes  that the “quasi-cause” is in this sense “ghostly,” it “is nothing outside of its  effect,” but neither can it be reduced to its effect.53 The virtual and its potency  of quasi-cause “maintains with the effect an immanent relation which turns the  product [the order, the concept], the moment that it is produced, into something  productive.”54 We may say that the virtual powers nature’s orders, and nature’s  orders are an immanent expression of  that powering.  While psychoanalysis may prize the impersonal nature of  desire or will  (found in a subconscious), deleuze focuses upon the impersonal nature of  creative force found throughout all of  nature. remarking about nietzsche’s  concept of force, deleuze notes that “consciousness merely expresses the rela- tion of certain reactive forces to the active forces which dominate them.”55 in  What is Philosophy?, deleuze states that philosophy is fundamentally a creation  of concepts bound to these forces, that is, upon the various “intensities” that  help to make the immanent plane. We are also told that these intensities are  “pre-personal” and of a universal power.56 The universal power is what deleuze  calls “creativity,” and it is creativity that forges concepts that are not merely la- 50. ibid., 94–95. 51. ibid., 6. 52. ibid. 53. ibid., 7. 54. ibid., 95. 55. gilles deleuze, Nietzsche and Philosophy, trans. hugh Tomlinson (minneapolis: univer- sity of minnesota Press, 1983), 40. 56. deleuze and guatarri, What is Philosophy? viii, 44.

Aesthetics for deleuze  is the philosophical domain of creativity.  As deleuze sees it, the philosophical creation of concepts is an “art” where  the activity of a concept’s creation hinges on the creation of a new possibility  for meaning altogether. As deleuze writes, art creates “a bloc of sensation, that  is to say, a compound of percepts and affects (concepts) that are a first-order  creative effect of the infinitizing process.”58 for deleuze, the task of art (aes- thetical philosophy) is to produce “signs” that “push us out of our habits” of  sensuous perception back into the very conditions of creation—latching back, as  it were, to nature’s own transcendental and generative conditions. This entry via  the aesthetic creation of concepts belongs to the “quasi-causal” feedback loop  that is folded back into nature’s own generative and transcendental ground. As  steven shaviro summarizes, for deleuze, “works of art are expressions of the  virtual, of becoming, and of transformation. When we experience them, ‘we are  not in the world, we become with the world; we become by contemplating it.’”59  The crucial idea is that concepts arise from a first-order qualitative experience,  having been produced from a continuum that is virtual, nonactual, and hence  not of one’s own making. This is precisely how natura naturans is ultimately  other than the human, but is also productive of and related to the human.  Turning to how the actual is qualitatively linked to the virtual, phenomeno- logical feeling comes to the fore in that the creative process (art, the creation  of  concepts given a virtual field) involves not only the virtual’s own effect  but the human’s own desire to express the meaning of  that effect. This stems  from the fact that, as corrington puts it, “we long to rejoin these powers [of  the transcendent] but cannot get across. We can understand our longing, and  thereby understand something of  what we miss . . . but we cannot become  whole with our ground.”60 for deleuze, this means that the human process  is in the midst of  nature’s creative becoming and desires to express that be- coming through an aesthetic but also phenomenological (descriptive) act.  but expression seems to occur through a cobecoming (natura naturans and  natura naturata) of  qualitative feeling within an aesthetic, rather than strictly  57. ibid., 5–6. 58. deleuze and guatarri, What is Philosophy? 164. 59. steven shaviro, “The Wrenching duality of the Aesthetic” (november 10, 2007), www  .shaviro.com/othertexts/sPeP.pdf (accessed July 2012). 60. corrington, Nature’s Religion, 8.

Therefore, the philosopher, now an artist attempting  to portray natura naturans, must be careful to allow one’s own personal desire  and longing, one’s own personal hoped for outcomes, to distort the nature of  what is created. Art in this sense, therefore, is an experimentation rather than  mere personal expression. As deleuze writes, aesthetics is “divided into two  irreducible domains: that of  the theory of  the sensible which captures only  the real’s conformity with possible experience; and that of  the theory of  the  beautiful, which deals with the reality of  the real insofar as it is thought. ev- erything changes once we determine the conditions of  real experience, which  are larger than the conditioned and which differ in kind from the categories:  the two senses of  the aesthetic become one, to the point where the being of  the sensible reveals itself  in the work of  art, while at the same time the work  of art appears as experimentation.”61 As an “impersonal” form of experimen- tation, the person must become the “conceptual person” endowed with the  characteristics of  the quasi-causal operator.62 “conceptual personae,” unlike  psychological “selves,” do not refer to psychological phenomena but to the  “very being of  the sensible” and are intimately connected with the conditions  responsible for the generation of  the sensible.63  What may one take from this peculiar treatment of  aesthetics?—that is,  from a reading of  nature something that is mostly “unread” conceptually but  primarily felt and expressed in the aesthetic creation of  a concept, in a work  of philosophical art? in the terms of ecstatic naturalism: how is one to release  their own projections and align an ultimate-reality-seeking consciousness to  the rhythmic emergence of presemiotic content that is continually lapsing into  the already actual semiotic orders of  the world? As a conclusion i would like  to briefly look to schopenhauer’s philosophy so as to find some directions  that one might take in order to compliment the aesthetic phenomenology that  one finds in deleuze. i would like to do so in order to mine resources that  may benefit the development of  ecstatic naturalism broadly conceived, for  it was schopenhauer who said that through art, “the person who is involved  in [aesthetic] perception is no longer an individual. for in such perception  the individual has lost himself; he is pure will-less, painless, timeless subject  of knowledge.”64 61. deleuze, Difference and Repetition, 68. 62. deleuze, What is Philosophy, 75–76. 63. ibid. 64.

Conclusion: A Phenomenological Aesthetic of Nature As corrington puts it, nature naturing “leave[s] us very close to schopenhauer’s  Will. The Will, read cosmically, is without order or direction. it is the original  chaos, pure striving without a striving for, without a to which or a from which— just a will to life. nb it is more accurate to speak of a will to life than of a will to  live as the former captures the push and shove of the Will as it objectifies itself   under the conditions of space, time and causality.” for me, schopenhauer’s  concept of the Will is the least-worst analogue to the concept of nature naturing  that we have, and it can be deployed in a variety of contexts.65  one may say, along with schopenhauer, that the will-less subject, “channel- ing” nature’s own rhythmic emergence, remains in the jurisdiction of matrices of  knowledge that import concepts of the understanding not necessarily conducive  to their emergent source. however, an openness to contemplation and recep- tivity are distinctly closer to the universal form of nonthought (deleuze) that  seeks to “think” the “unthinkable” if  one follows schopenhauer in attempting  to become “the will-less subject.” While the artist displaces ideas in his or her  work, it is the artistic creative act that demonstrates the projection of nature  naturing and not the human artist her or himself–in effect it is the possession  of  the artist in a creative moment that permits what is created.  may we level the charge of  anthropocentrism against schopenhauer too,  given that for him, the solution to “the riddle of existence” was to be found  within the human interior? recall that for schopenhauer the human is the  immediate object of  the Will. in the approach that i would like to propose  here, however, being an immediate object of the Will, one should be able to  phenomenologically direct one’s gaze into the immediacy of  objectivities that  are the Will (natura naturans) and perceive that which makes acts possible. in  this it is agreed that in the end, human must become “will-less,” a “pure subject”  through which nature’s creativity may emerge. schopenhauer summarizes such  a moment writing that “the capacity to remain in a state of pure perception, to  lose oneself in perception, to remove from the service of the will the knowledge  which originally existed only for this service . . . is the ability to leave entirely  out of sight our own interest, our willing, and our aims, and consequently to  discard entirely our own personality for a time, in order to remain pure know- ing subject, the clear eye of the world; and this not merely for moments, but  with the necessary continuity and conscious thought to enable us to repeat by  deliberate art what has been apprehended.”66 65. robert s. corrington, blog entry, August 2011, http://ecstaticnaturalism.blogspot.com/  2011/08/nature-naturing-and-will.html (accessed August 2012). 66.  schopenhauer, World as Will, 185–86. AJTP 34_1 text.indd   33 1/11/13   2:36 PM </page> <page sequence="18"> 34 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy  in the phenomenological aesthetic described in this paper, releasing the  will and releasing (“creating’) concepts according to nature’s own rhythmic  emergence means that the subject, when “outside all temporal objectivity,”  appears to be in direct contact with the intensity of  the Will.67 We learn from  schopenhauer that the truth of  “being, becoming, ground and will,” are pro- jections upon the surface, detached from an inner truth of  the Will itself.  corrington sensed this aesthetic phenomenology at work in schopenhauer,  writing that schopenhauer “did succeed in linking the transformation of the  self  with an understanding of  the hidden depths of  the world. . . . he pierced  the veil of  ontological difference and thereby put pressure on any eschatologi- cal or progressive framework that would paint nature in terms congenial to  human longing.”68 for schopenhauer, the remedy for apprehending the real  “subjectivity” of  the Will is to allow, paradoxically, the nonhuman to shine  through what is human. my suggestion is to allow the nonhuman to shine  through what is nonhuman. 67. see James luchte, “The body of sublime Knowledge: The Aesthetic Phenomenology  of Arthur schopenhauer,” Heythrop Journal 50, no. 2 (2009): 228–42. 68. robert corrington, Nature’s Religion, 18.
