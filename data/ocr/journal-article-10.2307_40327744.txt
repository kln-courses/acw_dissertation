<plain_text><page sequence="1">TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA By R. Lauriston Sharp IMPORTANT additions have been made in recent years to our * hitherto very meagre and fragmentary information on aboriginal totemism in the north-easternmost parts of Australia. In particular the contributions of Miss Ursula McConnel, Dr. R. L. Sharp and Dr. Donald Thomson outline the totemic cult patterns for several contiguous areas which together comprise a major portion of that part of Cape York Peninsula, North Queensland, which lies between the latitudes of twelve and fifteen degrees south.1 Using these materials as a basis for comparison, I propose to summarize whatever is known at present of the totemic aspects of cultures found in the peninsular and neighbouring regions of the north-eastern part of the continent.2 The location of the hundred-odd tribes here considered may be seen on the accompanying map. While all of this area is tropical, its geography varies from the flat recent alluvial country around the 1 Pertinent material from the reports of these authors is conveniently reproduced in Frazer, 1937, 188-243. (A complete bibliography is given at the end of the paper.) 2 The data here presented are based primarily on information gathered in the course of field surveys which I conducted during 1933, 1934, and 1935 under the auspices of the Australian National Research Council. Expense involved in the preparation of these data has been defrayed by the Trustee-Faculty Committee on Research of Cornell University. The unsatisfactory nature of much of this material is due both to the limited time I could allow for survey work, a limitation aggravated by the exigencies of travel in this area, and to the demoralization of native life which has so swiftly followed the introduction of European and Oriental culture traits into many parts of the region. Such tribes as the Bentinck Islanders of the Gulf of Carpentaria or the Taior on the west coast of the Peninsula are untouched by the lethal influences of civilization, but elsewhere others are extinct and many have undergone foreign and inter-tribal acculturation. I have accordingly drawn on other available sources of information for the area in order to make the study as complete as possible, and all known tribes in the region are listed even though information on their totemism is lacking. The transcription of native terms follows with modifications the system used by Oceania.</page><page sequence="2">TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA 255 Gulf of Carpentaria to the geologically ancient highlands along the Pacific coast of Cape York Peninsula. Thus the eastern slopes of the Atherton Tableland, a region of tropical rain forest with a wealth of flora and fauna, is a distinct contrast to the more barren country to the west. However, nowhere in the entire area is there any lack of natural resources which would seriously disturb the security of aboriginal life, although climatic variations impress upon the native the contrast between years of plenty and years of drought. Most of the area is within the range of the north-west monsoons which introduce a rainy season extending from October to April during which the native social life is much restricted. During the dry season of the south-east trade winds, however, there is an expansion of activity and this period becomes the sacred season in which aboriginal totemic life receives its most complete and intense expression. On the basis of common features of totemic organization the tribes in this area may be divided into a number of groupings, each named for some typical tribe of the group. It is these divisions which will be considered in order, proceeding from north to south. /. Kaurareg Type. The 1. Kaurareg inhabited the southernmost of the Western Islands of Torres Strait, Muralag (Prince of Wales), Narupai (Horn), Kiriri (Hammond), Waiben (Thursday) and others.3 Haddon and Rivers have given an account of the totemism of these people.4 My information, obtained from four surviving inhabitants of Muralag now living on Moa Island, is not entirely in agreement with theirs. My data indicate that the totemic organiza- tion in this area centres entirely around patrilineal localized named totemic clans regulating land tenure and associated with a single totem on which there is a tabu. Both moiety and section names are absent. 3 Haddon, 1904, Vol. II, refers to them as Kauralaig and includes in the group the Moa Islanders who are not considered here. *0p. cit., pp. 153-186.</page><page sequence="3">256 TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA J II \ / » \ 7 7 21¿22 2 \ 7 ^&gt;-) 2^26 23\ L 27 f afi/STl . 10 ) I 31 | ° Í Oape Yot* ¿2^ t 11 ) Peninsula 36 \ in Y 32 NN 12\ 58 z 33N\i3vyrA Carpentaria ) „ / % **"T ^^ Ul I V / J " 88 V 71 7677 8g\ \ »!

Kunindiri</page><page sequence="5">258 TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA Informants could name only a single totem (augud) associated with each patrilineal clan. However, each individual included among his own totems the totems of his own mother's, father's mother's and mother's mother's patrilineal clans and he might also include the totem of his father's father's mother's clan if he could remember it. Thus each person appears to have at least four totems and may have more if adoption or other circumstances bring other totems into the kinship groups or if he is aware of more distant genealogical totemic connections. It is only the totem of one's own patrilineal clan that is tabu. However, a person may not marry anyone who has any of the totems he calls his own unless that person comes from a different island. The Muralag totems are predominately natural species, but as Haddon and Rivers point out, they also include a star (titui) and a mythical hero or ancestor of Australian provenience (Kwoiam).* Certain personal names may be derived from the totems with which an individual is associated. The clans were localized and the patrilineal system of land tenure seems to have been regulated by considerations of patrilineage or clan membership, these islanders having had a hunting and gathering economy little more advanced than that of the mainland Aborigines. Mourning rites included explicit or symbolic reference to the totem of the dead and initiation rites were in part centred about the totems. Nothing could be learned of any rites to increase or control the totems. //. Yathaikeno Type. Extant tribes : 2. Kekoseno, 3. Yathaikeno, 4. Wotadi, 5. Nggamadi, 6. (Idj)Onyengadi, (Idj)Ebawudjeno, and (Idj)Okara, 7. Adjinadi. Extinct tribes : Apokwi, Oiyamkwi, Alauikeno and perhaps others.6 5 Besides the totems listed by Haddon and Rivers, I recorded as totems a " stone fish " (badar) and a crocodile, presumably C. Johnstonii (kadar). 6 In this area of small tribes it is difficult for the transient observer to distinguish purely local or clan groupings from the larger tribal groupings which are differentiated on the basis of common language and culture. There was common agreement [Footnote continued on next page,]</page><page sequence="6">TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA 259 The totemic organization of these tribes is characterized by the absence of named moieties and sections ; the presence of patrilineal local totemic clans associated with multiple linked totems which are not ordinarily tabu ; and, as a most distinguishing feature, the assignment of strictly tabued personal totems to individuals of both sexes after puberty, these being chosen from the totems of the mother's clan by divination. At least some of the tribes in this area have a general term for totem (3. eyenkeno, 6. eyeneken). Among all the tribes, however, an individual refers to his own patrilineal clan totems by the term for father's father (2. uratha, 3., 5. woratha, 4. olmura, 6. worama, 7. wold). Each clan has at least five or six totems. In the examples gathered, fauna and flora predominate, but mythical ancestors and named countries are also included as totems. An individual's personal names are derived from one or more of these clan totems but no special attitude is adopted in regard to such totems. A person further distinguishes the totems of his mother's patrilineal line of kinship descent, applying to these the term for mother's father (2, 3, 5 : atitha ; 4 : otiti ; 6, 7 : ati) ; of his father's mother's patrilineal kinship line, for which the term for father's mother's brother is used (2, 3, 5 : apitha ; 4 : apipi ; 6, 7 : api) ; and of his mother's mother's line, to which is applied the term for this relative and her brother (2, 3, 5 : amitha ; 4 : amima ; 6, 7 : ami). The father's mother and the mother's mother totems are given no special consideration, but from the mother's father totems an individual's own personal maternal totems are chosen. {Continuation of footnote 6.] among informants that several groups analogous to the extant tribes have become extinct in the Cape York region. The extant groups listed are themselves badly decimated and disorganized. Of these tribes, 2, 6, and 7 have not been mentioned in the literature. Thomson, 1934, 219, gives the Tjongandji term, O'yungo, for the Onyengadi, Ebawudjeno and Okara. The Yathaikeno of the east coast likewise have but one term, Empikeno, for these three neighbouring groups. They distinguish themselves from each other, however, on the basis of slight differences of speech [idj.). I was informed by Kaurareg of Torres Strait that they knew the Kekoseno and the extinct neighbouring group, Alauikeno, as Gudang, a term reproduced by Ray, 1907, 271, for the people of Cape York proper. It should be noted that Alauian (Cape York) and Kekosen (Escape River) are place names, and the groups named for them may be local branches of a larger tribe.</page><page sequence="7">26o TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA This is done by the older men at a ceremony during which one of the upper median incisors is removed, a rite which each person undergoes shortly after puberty but which is not connected with the initiation. The gum is bled and the form the blood assumes is interpreted topographically as a river, sand beach, island, lagoon, sand ridge, and so on. Then as the tooth is worked on all such topographical features, e.g. all lagoons, of the mother's clan country are called off by name, the place named as the tooth breaks away becoming the individual's personal maternal totem (" mother's father," or a special term may be used, 2, 3, 5 : athiy).7 A number of informants had only a named country as personal maternal totem, but others had not only this place-totem but also some floral or f aunal species or a mythical ancestor, it being explained that these additional totems were associated with the named place. These associated animal or plant species are strictly tabu, these being the only " mother's father " totems which are tabu. The maternal country chosen in this way is thought of as the individual's " home- land," where he has special hunting privileges, although he is not the owner, and where he can expect only good luck to befall him.8 The personal maternal place-totems of a number of informants were described as " stone places " but no information indicating that these were totemic increase or control centres could be elicited, although this is quite possible in the light of data from other areas. The chief initiation rites of the Yathaikeno are called lamba, a term referring to both the elaborate ceremonies and the place they are held. The tabus and sanctions for the lamba are under the particular care of the mythical rainbow serpent, Opathiyo, but the rites are concerned also with other mythical ancestors and their activities. It is clear that the native feels spiritually bound to his maternal totemic country, it can be visited in dreams or be the subject of dreams, and some informants said that they came from this country when they were born, thus suggesting a belief in an individual pre-existent spirit resident in the maternal country. No explicit 7 This is the "ari" of Haddon, 1904, p. 193. 8 These countries are not inherited matrilineálly, as suggested by Haddon, 1904, p. 285.</page><page sequence="8">TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA 261 ideas concerning totemic conception beliefs could be obtained, however, except that one Nggamdi informant stated that children were " found " near water in the form of leeches or worms which entered a woman who knew by the " finding " that she was to have a child. ///. Koko Yao Type. Tribes : 8. Kandju, 9. Koko Yao, 10. Yankonyu, 11. Ompela, 12. Yintjingga, 13. Koko Ompindamo, 14. Bakanambia, 15. Walm- baria, 16. Mutumui.9 Totemic organization in this area is characterized by the presence of named patrilineal moieties which presumably in all of the tribes and certainly in some are totemic ; the absence of named sections ; the presence of named patrilineal local totemic clans practising an ancestor cult and the control of totems ; and the presence of personal maternal totems chosen by divination and strictly tabu. The reader may be referred to Thomson's article on the northern tribes of this area for a documented account of some of the details of this type of totemic organization. Here it need only be noted that the valuable material rescued by Hale and Tindale, although their presentation of it is somewhat confusing, seems to indicate that the same type of totemism prevails among the three southern tribes discussed by them. They state that all three have named patri- lineal moieties, but only the Walmbaria terms are given. Thus the moiety names in this area are as follows :10 Tribes Moieties I II 15 Ungawu Owaitnini 8, 13 Koiya Karpi 9, 10, 11 Koiyan Karpeya 9 Hale and Tindale, 1933, give meagre information on the last three tribes. Good accounts of the others may be found in Thomson, 1933 and 1935. Roth, 1910, p. 83, refers to the Mutumui by their Koko Yimidir name, Koko Negodi ; and the Bakanambia are his Koko Lama Lama, op. cit.f p. 94. Hale and Tindale, 1933, p. 69, say that the latter also call themselves Bakabanambia or Wanbara. All of these tribes have had long contact with Europeans, Orientals, Torres Strait Islanders and others, and are badly disintegrated. 10 Thomson, 1935, p. 459; Hale and Tindale, 1933, p. 79, who add, "One suspects that formerly other names were known, such as Karpia and Koiana ..." found among neighbouring tribes to the west.</page><page sequence="9">2Ó2 TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA Associated with the first moiety are the native companion (15 : ungawu) among the Walmbaria and fire among the Koko Yao (9) ; and with the second, a kangaroo (15 : owaimini) and water (9). The Walmbaria also have a Native Companion Clan, as have the Bakanambia (14), and a Kangaroo Clan, the latter having whale (15 : arkeita) as a subsidiary totem. It is possible that these clan totems, which would normally be associated with the moieties in a secondary way, have been given in place of the original or proper moiety names. It is not known whether moiety totems as such are treated ritually. Among the northern tribes moiety opposition is expressed in games and other ceremonial forms. Hale and Tindale mention a number of local patrilineal clans among the three tribes they dealt with. With each clan is associated one or a pair of totems, the examples given consisting entirely of faunal forms. They report that these totems, except for certain subsidiary ones, can not be eaten by clan members, a practice rather at variance with the custom of neighbouring tribes. Since the three tribes are broken up and rapidly dying out, it is possible that these may be simply mourning tabus for absent or recently deceased fellow clansmen. Each of the clans reputedly speaks a slightly different dialect, but this designation of the clans as of different " speech " may be only a fiction for further differentiating these groups as is the custom elsewhere on the Peninsula. Since the clans may be referred to by the place-names of localities with which they are associated as well as by the names of their totems, it would appear that there must be a patrilineal system of land tenure somehow regulated by the clan or totemic organization. Personal names among the Walmbaria are given by the father or father's brother and may be place-names, thus leading to the assumption that the naming system is also linked with clan totemism. For the Mutumui it is reported that a Dugong Clan of the second moiety has the frilled lizard (16 : karuyen) as a " subsidiary totem," while at the same time this frilled lizard (16 : karuyen) is given as the chief totem of a clan of the first moiety.11 In any of the tribes 11 Hale and Tindale, op. cit., p. 82.</page><page sequence="10">TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA 263 of the Peninsula outside of this area it would normally be quite impossible for any totem to be associated with members of both patrilineal moieties in the same community. However, among the northern tribes of this area such an association would be quite normal, for individuals in one moiety would have as their personal maternal totem (9 : nartjimo norntadji) some totemic species or place associated primarily, i.e. as a patrilineal totem (9 : pola, father's father), with the opposite moiety or with some clan within the opposite moiety. A person is associated not only with all the patrilineal totems of his own clan, but also with one of the patrilineal totems of his real or classificatory mother's clan, all these totems being called by him " mother's father " (9 : nartjimo). The evidence from the Mutumui, though hardly conclusive, would seem to indicate that the same system may prevail among them ; in that case it would be possible for an informant of the Dugong Clan of Moiety II to give as one of his totems a species primarily associated with a clan of Moiety I. Furthermore, it is reported that the initiation ceremonies of the Mutumui include tooth avulsion.12 Among the northern tribes of this area tooth avulsion is definitely not connected with initiations, nor is it among any of the tribes mentioned in this study. But in the northern part of this area, as in Area II, the knocking out of teeth as an essential aspect of the personal maternal totemism is a ceremonial practice which takes place shortly after puberty for both sexes. This may also be the custom among the Mutumui, or at least it would appear that the Mutumui tooth avulsion is a ritual practice, as it is to the north but as it is not to the south and west. The Hale and Tindale material would thus seem to provide some basis for supposing that the three southern tribes here included in this area have a system of maternal personal totemism. Among the northern tribes there are totem centres (9 : tjartji watjaman) established by the mythical ancestors (9 : yilamu) and usually marked by stones dating from ancestral times (9 : omonoma). At some of these sites there are control rites of the talu type for such totems as sexual licence, dugong, crab, and other species. These 12 Hale and Tindale, op. cit.t p. 84.</page><page sequence="11">2Ó4 TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA rites are apparently conducted by a few older men of the clan at centres in their own clan territory for totems of their own clan. It is not known whether such rites are also found in the southern part of the area. The usual historical and initiatory rites are found among all the tribes. In the north, one initiation (9 : moyka) is associated with the mythical rainbow serpent and another (9 : okainta) with the ancestral crocodile.13 These ceremonies, like those in the preceding area, require an elaborate cult paraphernalia, including masks and drums. Bullroarers are used but there is no evidence that they are associated with the spirits of living persons. Among the northern tribes an individual's spirits are intimately associated with some place in his mother's clan or moiety country. It is to this spot, often a totem centre, that the spirits return, one in childhood (9 : norntal) and one at death (9 : mipi). Belief in reincarnation or genetic descent from the totems or totemic ancestors is absent. There is no information from this area on possible systems of belief relating to conception and linking it with the totemic system. In presenting his material Thomson has emphasized the fact that among the northern tribes there is a recognition of biological paternity, but this would not necessarily mean an absence of totemic conception beliefs which are present in all other areas of north-eastern Australia for which we have adequate information except probably Area I. IV. Tjongandji Type. Representative extant tribes : 17. Ngathokadi, 18. Tepethiki, 19. Tjongandji, 20. Yop'ngadi or Ngerikadi, 21. Wimarango, 22. Ngwatangeti, 23. " Kauwala," 24. Lenngeti, 25. Mamangeti, 26. Latangeti, 27. Anda'angeti, 28. Aditinngeti, 29. Wik Alkina or Wik Natera. Extinct tribe : Wik Tinda and perhaps others.14 13 Thomson, 1933, p. 503, notes that this crocodile ancestor is associated with the sexual license totem. The same association is found among the Yir Yoront (V-42) and is memorialized in their Wot NgcUta initiation. McConnel, 1936, p. 87, reports the intervening Wik Munkan (V-32) crocodile totem as a mythical ancestor was notorious for his sexual appetites. 14 Again in this area of small tribes it is not easy to distinguish local groupings, clans, or slightly differentiated linguistic groupings from tribes. This is exemplified [Footnote continued on next page.]</page><page sequence="12">TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA 265 Totemism in this area apparently centres entirely about the patrilineal local cult clans which have multiple totems ordinarily not tabu. Maternal personal totems are absent, as are totemic moieties or sections. Among the Tjongandji the several clans are grouped into four geographical divisions, each of these being exogamous, but none having any totemic associations peculiar to itself.15 There seems to be some (questionable evidence that exogamous matrilineal moieties exist among tribes south of the Mission River, but there is no suggestion that such groupings are totemic.16 [Continuation of footnote 14.] in the disagreements among the data collected by McConnel, Thomson and myself. For the region between the Embley and Archer Rivers, McConnel, 1936, p. 455, gives " Andyingit, Leiningiti, Aritingiti, Ndra'angit, etc." Her Leiningiti (Thomson, 1934, p. 219, Lainingitti ; Roth, 1910, p. 96, Laini-ngadi) is the term applied by northern neighbours to the Lenngeti (24) ; her Ndra'angit is apparently my Anda'angeti (27) ; but none of my informants referred to an Aritingiti or Andyingit tribe. On the other hand I have references to such " tribes " as Alinngeti, Evngeti, Agangeti, and farther north, Mbakadi, none of which are mentioned by either McConnel or Thomson, and which I do not list because I am not sure they are tribes rather than local groups or sub-tribes. The last named, Mbakadi, is the group referred to by the Tjongandji as Limretti, as noted by Thomson, 1934, p. 219. The Ngwatangeti (22) are referred to by Thomson, 1934, p. 219, and Roth, 1910, p. 96, as Tanikutti and Taini-kudi which I understood to be the Tjongandji term for them. My Ngathokadi (17) are called Athokurra by Thomson, loc. cit. " Kauwala " (23) I suspect to be an inappropriate geographical or descriptive term for an inland group running between York Downs and Merluna ; culturally they are more closely allied to the " -ngeti " tribes than to the northern Kandju east of them. The Wik Alkina (29) are included here because superficially their totemic traits link them with these tribes ; otherwise, their cultural affinities are with the north-western tribes of Area V. 16 In regard to these divisions my own information, although obtained inde- pendently, is in complete accord in all major points with that reported by Thomson, 1934, pp. 224-226. To the south some of the tribes appear to be exogamous and it is possible that some of the confusion relating to tribal distribution here may be resolved by the discovery that certain " tribes " are really exogamous geographical groupings of clans. 16 This wholly anomalous and unexpected matrilineal organization was reported to me for both the Aditinngeti and Lenngeti, Moiety X being termed in the former tribe Moialtien and in the latter, Ewangelkin, Moiety Y, Maitan and Metan. Thus an Aditinngeti woman, her siblings, all of her children, her mother, a father's brother's wife, and the father's father were all included in a division called Moialtien, while her children's spouses, her husband, her father and his brother, and her father's mother were all Maitan. The real significance of the groupings, if such they are, must be left to future research.</page><page sequence="13">266 TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA In this area, as in the two preceding, one's own patrilineal totems are known by the term for father's father (19 : rrwe ; 23 : olwaia ; 28 : olai). A Yop'ngadi word, riniseno, may apparently be used as a general term for totem, but in none of the other tribes could a general term be found. In the north all clans are named for territories, and this practice is also common, but not universal, in the south. Each clan has half a dozen or more totems (the " Kauwala " Wakmata Clan has at least two dozen), these totems being predominately natural species, but including also named countries and " story places," some artifacts, and mythical anthropo- morphic and theriomorphic ancestors. Personal names are derived from the patrilineal totems or place-totems, which are also used in the interpretation of dreams. In the south these totems, as such, are not tabu, but some Tjongandji and Yop'ngadi informants felt that while such totems could be killed they should not be eaten, being " too much like father belong we." Throughout the area the patrilineal totems of the maternal kinship lineage are distinguished from own totems and are known by the kinship term for mother's father (19, 23 : tata ; 28 : tji). No special attitude is adopted towards any of these maternal totems. In similar fashion, two other sets of totems are distinguished, those of the father's mother's line (19 : paia ; 23 : paip ; 28 : pat) and those of the mother's mother's line (19 : mata ; 23 : main ; 28 : mai) . Nothing was learned concerning the increase or control of totems except for a Tjongandji informant's obscure statement that flesh from any male corpse buried by male clansmen in particular parts of their own clan country would increase all clan totems associated with these places. Typical historical rites, including initiations, are held throughout the area and reproduce the activities of the mythical ancestors. An initiation of the Tjongandji and Yop'ngadi centres about anthropomorphic ancestors named Tjiveri and Enryungo and includes the use of drums and masks, traits which are not found</page><page sequence="14">TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA 267 farther south in this area.17 The Tjongandji use the prefix djutnbru- to distinguish persons or totems pertaining to the mythical ancestral times from persons or things of the present. Roth, 1905, pp. 18, 23, gives a well-known account of Tjongandji conception and spirit beliefs. A patrilineal totemic spirit associated with each individual is referred to by him as " choi-i " but was called by one of my informants ydjuga. Whatever the term for it, this is a pre-existent spirit or spirit-stuff resident since the beginning of time in a well in the clan country together with the ancestral rrwe (totems or mythical father's fathers). It is " found " by the father and during intercourse enters the mother where it becomes the vital principle as seen in a person's pulse. The same spirit or some of the same spirit-stuff animates a man's children or a woman's brother's children. It is the provenience of this ydjuga, determined by divination when the umbilical cord is cut, that defines the individual's " homeland " and thus associates him in the minds of his fellows with a particular clan totemic complex. At death an individual's ydjuga returns to the clan well and is apparently reassimilated into the general ydjuga supply there. However, it may sometimes be confused with the deceased's ghost which wanders in the bush as a shadow form. Bull-roarers are not associated with the ancestral totemic spirit nor related in any other way with living persons' spirits. 17 Tjiveri or Sivirri, a thoroughly typical Australian mythical anthropomorphic ancestor, is identified by these natives with the Torres Strait culture-hero Kwoiam, who clearly represents a mainland aboriginal. This has led Thomson, 1934, to infer an importation into this northern area of a Papuan hero cult, a conjecture strenuously combated by McConnel, 1936, pp. 80-91, with whom, in the main, I must agree. There is no question of Papuan influences in the northern Peninsula, as seen in drums, masks, aprons, and other traits, but the identification of particular Australian mythical totemic ancestors with particular Papuan or Torres Strait culture heroes may be the result of quite recent acculturation. Men from the Mitchell River Mission spend hours discussing whether this or that mythical ancestor should be identified with some hero from Torres Strait mythology of whom they have heard for the first time within the present generation through direct contact with Torres Strait Islanders. Islanders having contact with mainland aboriginals are also at pains to bring their own mythology into accord with the mainland systems, and one of their first concerns is to find a mainland equivalent for their Kwoiam who was a mainlander.</page><page sequence="15">268 TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA V.

Rites to control totems are reported from all parts of the area except among the Yidindji, Kungandji, and Yirkandji in the south-east, for whom information on this point is lacking. In this area practically the entire universe contributes phenomena which are considered totems, these being divided between the various clans and the two moieties. 18 Most of the tribes along the east coast (46-57) have been mentioned in various papers by McConnel, Richards, or Roth. The totemism of the Wik Munkan and allied tribes has been outlined in papers by McConnel and that of the Yir Yoront and allied tribes in papers by Sharp. Richards, 1926, p. 265, mentions a " Ngarl- kajee " tribe located near Mossman ; this is perhaps the Niakali (54). The Koko Papung (45), misprinted " Koko Papun " in Sharp, 1.934, p. 406, are the " Gunanni " of Roth, 1910, p. 95, and probably the " Goonamon " of Mathews, 1899a, p. no. The Yir Yoront are the " Koko Mindjin " of Thomson, 1933, p. 455, and " Koko Manjoen " of Roth, 1910, map. Thomson, 1935, p. 462, gives " Koko Ai'ebadu " for my Aiabado (33) ; the at- prefix, like oi-, wik-, yir- and koko-, means " speech." 19 McConnel, 1931, p. 23, reports four named sections for the Koko Moloroidji, but informants from this tribe distinguished themselves in this respect from the neighbouring Wakura, Koko Mini, and other tribes with four named sections. Koko Yerlandji informants disclaimed a four section system, although Roth, 1910, p. 100, ascribes to them an organization of that type ; however, since my informants were southern members of the tribe, it is possible that the northern Koko Yerlandji, with whom Roth came in contact, do have sections similar to those of their neighbours to the west and north.</page><page sequence="16">TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA 269 The moiety organization is very similar to that which will be described for the next area. The moiety names among the various tribes are as follows r20 Tribes Moieties I II 33 Koiya Karpi 34 . . . . . . . . . . Kuyen Karpen 30, 31, 32 Kuyan Katpi 35, 38, 39 Kuyen(u) Katpen(u) 40, 41 Pam Tul Pam Bib 42, 43 Pam Lui Pam Bib 44 Pa Turi Pa Bib 45 Par Durp Par Bib 46, 47, 48 Walar, Raku Muraygang, Worpu, Mirki 49 Walar Dabu, Murla 50, 51, 52 Walar Dabu 53, 54 Kuraminya Kur abana 55, 56, 57 Kurakulu Kurabana The terms Raku, Pam Lui and variants, and Kuyen and variants signify a small nocturnal bird which is unidentified, but which is characterized by its regular metallic call ; Mirki, Pam Bib, Katpen and their variants represent a night owl, mopoke, or night hawk ; Walar is a yellow bee, while Dabu and Muraygang are black bees, and Murla and Worpu other bees classified with the black variety. Kuraminya and Kurakulu are associated with the dry season, the land, hunting, fire, the sun, and things red ; Kurabana, with the wet season, water, the moon, and things white. Totems and territories of the constituent clans may be generally associated with the moieties also. The chief moiety totems (48 : tjauin) are strictly tabu, being the only totems which are always tabu. There is a ritual desecration 20 Thomson, 1935, p. 464, says that there are no moieties among the Wik Munkan (32). McConnel, 1934, p. 310, p. 354, reports the same moieties for the entire tribe that were given to me by informants from the western Wik Munkan territories, both north and south. Informants furthermore reported moieties with the same names for the Kok Iala, inland north of the Archer River, and a Kok Mbewam informant whose homeland was as far north as Merluna at the head of the Watson River stated that the same moieties were present among his people who did not use the Koiya and Karpi terms of the neighbouring Kandju. On the other hand, the Wik Alkina (IV-29), between the Archer and the coast to the north-west of the Wik Munkan, like the tribes directly north of them, lack these moieties. D</page><page sequence="17">270 TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA of these totems, followed by a mock combat between the men of the moieties, in all of the following tribes : 34, 35, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48. This ceremonial is apparently absent among the eastern coastal tribes and is unreported for the Wik Munkan (32), Aiabado (33), and Kok Mbewam (30). Moiety solidarity may also be shown in the wrestling matches between distant male siblings which are common throughout this area. Among some of the western tribes (39-45) and perhaps elsewhere the moieties are not necessarily exogamous, many intra-moiety marriages being recorded. The totemic clan in this area is normally associated with multiple totems and with multiple named countries which need not be contiguous and which may be regarded as totems even though the generic term for totem is not usually applied to a country. The Aiakampana and Aiabakan clans have single totems, but here the phratric grouping of clans, present in most tribes of this area, appears to be particularly strong, a member of a phratry being quite definitely related to the totems of the phratry's constituent clans. However, it is not known whether these phratries are named as they are among the neighbouring Yir Yoront and allied tribes. While the totemic interpretation of dreams is universal in the area, the same term is applied to dreams and to totems only among some of the eastern tribes. The various terms for totems are : 30 : olwo, father's father ; 32 : pulwaia, country, mythical ancestor, related to term pola, father's father, and used for elements of own totemic complex ; katwaia, used for totems, countries, ancestors of mother's patrilineal line ; 34 : pun (cf. 42, 43) ; 35 : kamwoi, or kamoin, related to term kamia, father's father ; 39 : kamoi, mythical ancestor, related to term kerne, mother's mother and her brother ; 40, 41 : polawar, country, mythical ancestor, related to root pu- of pumin, elder brother and father's father ; 42, 43 : purn, mythical ancestor ; naur human, clan and its totemic complex ; napur, name, rarely used for totem ; 44, 45 : piyanam, root pi-, related to things patrilineal ; 47 : rjuyer, dream (cf . 74, 75, 76) ; 48 : kamiy, father's father, mythical ancestor, for own totems ; tjatji, mother's father, for totems of mother's patrilineal line ; tjauin, moiety totems only ; 50 : yirimbal ; 51, 54 : pitjar, dream ;</page><page sequence="18">TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA 271 55&gt; 56, 57 i buleru, father's father, country, mythical ancestor, totem. While the tendency to universal totemism precludes the listing of all non-faunal or non-floral totems, certain of the more common and well defined totems in this category may be mentioned : various kinds of stones (40-45, 54-57) i mud or claY (39*43, 55~57) ; water, cloud, rain, thunder, lightning (34, 35, 39~45&gt; 48&gt; 53"57) ; rainbow serpent (39-45, 50, 55-57) ; wind (39-44, 53-57) ; sun (40-44, 53-57) ; daylight (42, 43, 55-57) ; night (42, 43, 55-57) ; m&lt;*&gt;n (39*45&gt; 50, 53, 54) ; stars (32, 37"44&gt; 55-57) ; fire (32, 39-44, 4», 53-57) ; red or white paint (40-43, 55-57) ; axe (40-44, 55-57) ; spears (39-44, 55-57) ; spear thrower (39-44, 51) ; boomerang (40-44, 55-57) ; fish hooks and lines (40-43, 55-57) ; fish net (40-44) ; canoe (37, 55-57) ; duly bags (40-44, 51, 55-57) ; heart (40-43, 45) ; blood (38, 40-43) ; tibia (40-43, 55-57) ; genitals (32, 39-44) ; head cold (39-44) ; nausea (40-44) ; excreta (40-44) ; sexual passion (40-44) ; sweetheart (32, 39-44) ; adolescent girl (32, 39~44) ; baby (32, 37, 39~44) ; ghost or corpse (32, 35, 39-45). The Aiakampana are apparently the only tribe in the area among whom there is a general rule against killing or eating edible clan totems. A Koko Moloroidji informant said he would kill any of his clan totems unless they appeared particularly friendly, tame, or easy to kill, their unusual behaviour requiring interpretation in reference to some fellow clansman, dead or alive, as in a dream. Here also, as among other tribes (34, 35, 39-44, 47, 51), the totems or countries particularly associated with a deceased individual must be avoided by certain of his surviving kin for the period of mourning. In this area, as in others, personal names are derived from one or more of the clan totems, countries, or ancestors. The tabu on marrying a member of one's mother's clan is definitely absent among the western and northern tribes of the area, where a woman is given to her father's close sister's son if possible ; but the tabu is reported for the Koko Ialiu, Koko Moloroidji, and Koko Yerlandji, although genealogies from these tribes show that there may be exceptions to the rule. For none of these tribes is there any evidence, other than the foregoing rules, of special attitudes towards the totems of the mother.</page><page sequence="19">272 TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA The description of the joint individual and clan land tenure system which will be given for the next area applies precisely to all parts of this area for which there is information. In this area also we find the associations between totems, countries, rites, and ancestors which constitute the totemic com- plexes of the various clans. These associations are made effective by means of sacred and profane accounts of events which transpired at the beginning of time when the ancestors related themselves to particular totems and land and established the sacred rites and ceremonies. None of the tribes seems to have any special name for the ancestral past, but some of them distinguish the sacred things of the past, together with the representations of past things in ceremonies, from the present and commonplace by the addition of an adjectival suffix (42, 43 : -waltelem, -niy ; 44, 45 : -taykain). Ceremonies for increasing or checking the supply of totems are reported for most of the tribes (32, 34, 35, 37"45&gt; 47 '&gt; 48&gt; 5°)- The sites or control centres (32 : auwa ; 34 : taykun ; 39 : auwauy ; 42, 43 : til) may be tabu (35, 47, 50 : djabul), not tabu (44), or in the one tribe some tabu and others not (39, 42 : y alt, muram). Rites to regulate the totems (32 : auwa kent'n ; 34 : pun atnal- theralt ; 39 : kamoi wunyenu ; 42 : purn malthera ; 47 : tjokawn) may be conducted by individuals only (34, 35) or by individuals and groups (32, 37-44), the former type being more frequent. Among the eastern tribes (47, 48, 50) a totem centre is found in the territory of a clan numbering that phenomenon among its totems and the rite is conducted by an adult male of the same clan.21 Also among the Wik Munkan, Aiabakan, and Aiakampana the conductor of the ceremony, the locus of the site, and the totem to be controlled all apparently must belong to one clan. To the south, however (39-45), the owner of a site is responsible for the ceremony, but the totem 21 For example, the Koko Yerlandji porcupine increase (tjokawn panilma) is done at the site in Porcupine Clan territory on Black Mountain (north of Maytown) by a Porcupine man who owns that particular territory ; at any time during the, year he visits the site, which is tabu to all not properly introduced to it, cleans it out, and throws dirt in all directions while he calls the names of countries where porcupine should be plentiful.</page><page sequence="20">TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA 273 may be of a different clan.22 So far as is known, all totemic control sites are believed to have been established by the mythical ancestors, and they are frequently associated with water, stones, or unusual rock formations. Initiations for girls are apparently lacking throughout the area but the usual boys' initiations are present (32 : successive stages, uthanam and wintjanam ; 34, 35 : putja ; cf . 63 ; 40-43 : woi yalt i.e. tabu ; woi welten ; 44, 45 : yiral, cf. 68, 86 ; 49 : yantja, i.e. tabu ; cf. 42, 64). 23 None of these ceremonies requires bodily mutilation of the initiands, nor does human blood play any improtant role. All of them are concerned with the representation of the more striking totems and ancestral events, members of the various clans acting the part of their own ancestors or totems. While rather elaborate ritual paraphernalia may be used, especially among the north-western tribes of the area, masks or drums of the type found farther north are lacking. Beliefs regarding spirit children and conception appear in varied forms throughout the area, though information on the matter is meagre. For the tribes about Cairns (55-57) Frazer, 1909, p. 146, reports " the acceptance of food from a man by a woman (is) the actual cause of conception," while Roth, 1903, p. 22, says : "... it is a particular species of pigeon which brings the already manu- factured baby to the mother in the course of a dream." As partial accounts these statements can best be interpreted in the light of what is known of conception beliefs for surrounding areas, where spirit babies may be found by a man and transferred to his wife in 22 Thus the Yir Yoront (42) have eight different centres for increasing rat (min kal tila) but only two of these are in territory of the Black Duck Clan which counts the rat among its totems. In the territory of this same tribe and related tribes (40-43) there are over one hundred individual totemic control sites, many of them for totems of little or no utility, and some of them for definitely harmful forms (diarrhoea, nausea, sore throats, head colds, sores, sexual passion, leeches, hornets, mosquitoes, and so on). 23 The Woi Welten and Putja centre primarily about the cult of a mythical python and inter-tribal conflicts in the ancestral times. The Woi Ngalt is concerned chiefly with an ancestral crocodile and an ancestress who symbolizes the sexual passion totem. Among these western tribes there are several other historical rites similar to the initiations but not compulsory for all youths, though correlated with the age-grading system.</page><page sequence="21">274 TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA food, or where they may appear in the form of some small natural species under mysterious circumstances directly to the mother. To the north, among the Koko Ialuniu and Koko Yimidir the spirit babies (50 : mulgal mulgal) originate in the west and are sent in the guise of some small natural agent directly to the woman by some mythical ancestor. The Koko Yerlandji (47) believe spirit babies (war aba) to be pre-existent ; as small natural phenomena they are found by the father or mother in the country of a close or distant (classificatory) father, in this latter case the child being considered a member of his real father's clan, the clan associations of the place where he was found being disregarded. Among the tribes in the south-west of the area (40-45) it is believed that the spirit baby (42 : leren yerp) has existed from mythical ancestral times in the land where he happens to be found by a father or mother ; he is therefore affiliated with the clan which owns this land, regardless of the clan affiliations of his real father. Normally, however, children are found in the clan territories of their real father and never outside the domain of some classificatory father. Among the Aiabakan and Aiakampana clan descent always follows the actual patrilineage ; the spirit babies (34 : bukwa nepi) are usually found in the father's clan land, but may be found in land belonging to another clan within the real father's phratry. Little is known concerning the fate of this pre-existent totemic personal spirit at death. Among the Koko Yimidir, Roth reports, the spirit (49 : wauwu) becomes a ghost but eventually travels eastward beyond the sea. Among the Koko Ialuniu this spirit (50 : wauwu) at death is differentiated from the ghost (50 : wuiygul, wiygul, topo).2* Among the south-western tribes (40-44) the totemic spirit (42 : yer) proceeds west across the Gulf while the ghost (42 : wayar) hovers about until forgotten. For the Wik Munkan (32) there is evidence that the individual's spirit returns at death to one of the clan totem centres and mourning rites include the symbolic representation of the deceased's totems.25 In any case there is no 24 Roth, 1903, p. 18. 26 McConnel, 1903, p. 187 ; 1937, pp. 357 ff.</page><page sequence="22">TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA 275 evidence from this area of reincarnation beliefs. It should be added that while bull-roarers are used throughout the area and are associated with particular totemic ancestors in some tribes, there is nothing to indicate the presence of tjuriya beliefs associating an individual's spirit with a roarer.
