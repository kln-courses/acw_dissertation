Memorias de la Misi6n Arqueolo6gica Espafiola en el Ecuador 7. Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores, Direcci6n General de Relaciones Culturales, Madrid, 1981. 120 pp., illus., biblio. Paper. Abstracted by Peter Stahl Anthropomorphic ceramic figurines from Late For- mative and Regional Developmental period context of the northern Ecuadorian and southern Colombian coasts are described and analyzed. Their cultural significance and function are clarified through the rigorous classification of approximately 2,000 specimens presently housed in diverse collections, or obtained through limited excavation. The figurines, which are found in the Tachina, Tumaco-Tolita, Tiaone, and Atacames cultures, reveal information through analyses of "correspondences" of attributes, temporal, spatial and interareal relationships, and the function of the figurines within their cultural realm. Previous classificatory schemes are reviewed and criticized. A revised classification based upon stylistic and typological analysis is presented, yielding data on material culture, physical type, life cycle, economy, society, and religious beliefs. These data are used to discuss the use, significance, and function of Tumaco-Tolita figurines. Previous hypotheses of function are examined and rejected, and Sanchez Montaneis supplants them with the sug- gestion that these figurines represented individuals' rites of passage. Early European Settlement and Exploitation in Atlan- tic Canada: Selected Papers. G. M. STORY, editor. International Symposium on Early European Set- tlement and Exploitation in Atlantic Canada, Memorial University of Newfoundland. St. John's. Newfoundland, 1982. 161 pp., biblio. $10.00 (paper). Abstracted by Dan R. Irwin The selected papers of this 1979 symposium collec- tively shed light on the historical and archaeological background of Atlantic Canada, especially New- foundland. The opening paper offers a sense of pur- pose and meaning to the conference. It aptly sets the scene for the following eight papers by focusing on the processes of colonization, economic penetration, and proselytism which brought Western European nations to this part of North America. Several of the papers deal with recent archaeolog- ical findings at specific sites, namely Red Bay, Labrador, along the Strait of Belle Isle, as well as Cupid's Cove and the Avalon peninsula in Newfound- land. All of these early attempts at settlement were efforts to take advantage of the whale and cod fish- ing nearby. Except for the introduction of the cod fish into European diets, little was known about New- foundland until about 1630. This was due to a lack of interest, ignorance, and misunderstanding of its geography. One paper develops the theme that colonization was unlike that of the New England or Virginia ex- periments, because Newfoundland's exploitation re- quired neither typical settlement patterns, new labor force, nor the production of a crop. A final contributed paper urges ethnologists, his- torians, archaeologists, and anthropologists to make better use of each others' research findings so as to achieve their scientific objectives. All have a role to play in the study of cultural change. The Southeastern Check Stamped Pottery Tradition: A View from Louisiana. IAN W. BROWN. M.C.J.A. Special Paper No. 4, Kent State University Press, Kent, Ohio, 1982. 100 pp., illus., biblio. $6.25 (paper). Abstracted by Carol A. Morrow This monograph presents detailed information about a single pottery type, Pontchartrain Check Stamped, from the Louisiana Gulf Coast area. Al- though Brown's focus is on the Petit Anse region, the fact that 50% of the sites in his study area yielded less than 10 sherds each does not seem to support his claim of a regional perspective. The major source of information for this study is obtained from the Morgan site (34-G-2) on Pecan Island, and Brown does a commendable job of presenting information on the Pontchartrain Check Stamped pottery recovered from the site. Twenty-seven tables and 38 figures are used to summarize a massive amount of primary data on this specific Coles Creek period pottery type. The varieties of this type are defined and illustrated, and the photographic quality of the illustrations overall is quite good. Of particular interest is the excellent review of the southeastern check stamped pottery tradition, discussed in detail by period and region. A bit more integration between this general overview of the check stamping tradition and the analysis of a specific type would have been preferable; however, Brown's paper does represent a major source of in- formation about check stamped ceramics in the Southeast, particularly during the Late Woodland period.
