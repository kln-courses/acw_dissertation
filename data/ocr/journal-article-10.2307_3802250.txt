Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY, USA; London, England, UK. 1995. viii + 200pp, index. $25.00 ISBN 0-8014-8264-X (paperback). Aborigines and dingoes evoke prehistoric images of Australia's isolated heritage and both Aborigines and dingoes (Canis lupus dingo) are facing extinction by the same mechanism: assimilation and interbreed- ing with their domesticated relatives. In "The Dingo: In Australia and Asia", Laurie Corbett documents the plight of the dingo and assesses management options for saving this part of Australia's biotic history. Corbett's text is one of the recent genre of natural history books in which rigorous, quantitative analysis has replaced anthropomorphic, anecdotal storytell- ing. Although cultural tales of the dingo in Australian society dot the text, Corbett relies primarily on his twenty years of field research and captive investi- gations to elucidate the ecology of this primitive dog in Australia and Asia. Fact replaces fiction not only in style but also in the first chapter, where Corbett dispels the myth that Australia's native dog was introduced to that conti- nent by Aborigines. Nor is the dingo indigenous to Australia. Instead, Corbett relates that dingoes were domesticated from wolves in southern Asia 6,000- 10,000 years ago and subsequently accompanied Asian sea voyagers to southeast Asia and Australia approx- imately 3,500-4,000 years ago, probably as a source of meat. Further colonization of Australia was aided by Aborigines who use dingoes to hunt game. After this initial foray into dingo ancestry, Corbett reviews methods for capturing and studying dingoes as well as major study sites for dingo research throughout Australia. Chapter three provides mor- phometric data including extensive details on coat color patterns throughout Australia and southeast Asian. These data suggest that Australian alpine, des- ert, and tropical dingoes are sufficiently distinct to warrant designation as separate subspecies of Canis lupus and that the Thai dingo is also sufficiently dif- ferent from Australian dingoes to merit subspecific status. Left open is the taxonomic status of dingoes from the rest of southeast Asia. Morphometric data are accompanied by data on gestation length, litter size, and seasonality from Aus- tralia and southeast Asia. Unlike domestic dogs, fe- male dingoes are monoestrus and thus breed only once each year. However, in equatorial areas, births may occur throughout the year. The effects of drought on reproduction are also discussed. Home range size, dispersal patterns, and migration using radiotracking data from across Australia are the topics of chapter four. Territory size is evaluated for packs as well as for individuals, and regional differ- ences in movements and living area are explained relative to predictability and abundance of food and water. As described in a later chapter, packs in remote regions of Australia are large and stable both tem- porally and spatially. These stable packs fragment during drought or in conjunction with human activ- ities such as pastoralism or dingo control. Behaviors associated with spacing of both individ- uals and packs are reviewed in chapters five and six. Corbett describes agonistic behaviors associated with dominance rank and illustrates the importance of ontogenetic history in achieving high rank. An ex- tensive section of chapter five is devoted to howling and other vocalizations. Corbett details physical char- acteristics of individual howls as well as group howls and illustrates how packs can identify each other from group vocalizations. The ecological and behavioral ramifications of howling as a territorial behavior are examined. The chapter ends with data on pheromonal communication, chiefly documenting the nonrandom distribution of fecal deposits and discussing experi- ments that test reactions of dingoes to these deposits. In chapter six detailed observations of a captive dingo pack over three breeding seasons amplify much less intensive observations of the behavior of wild packs in Australia over many years. Suppression of reproduction and infanticide are well documented as are greeting behaviors and communal feeding of pups. The former topics are discussed more completely in a later chapter on mortality. Two chapters are devoted to the ecology of feeding, and include such topics as regional diets across Aus- tralia, hunting tactics used with various prey sizes, prey defenses, optimal foraging, predator limitations on prey abundance, use of introduced versus native animals as prey, and dietary overlap with feral cats and foxes. These chapters reflect the sponsorship of the Australian Meat Research Corporation, and they emphasize the possible effects of dingoes on cattle, sheep, and the indigenous Australian fauna. Two il- lustrative case studies document how understanding dingo predation can maximize cattle production. In a comparison of Thai and Australian dingoes, Corbett notes that animal protein makes up 98 per- cent of the diet of Australian dingoes but only 8 percent of the diet of Thai dingoes. Corbett believes this is because most Asian dingoes are dependent upon humans for food. Although not discussed by Corbett, one significant difference in the ecology of dingoes in Asia versus Australia is competition. Aus- tralian dingoes compete with domestic dogs, feral cats, and introduced foxes, whereas Asian dingoes must compete not only with the former two but also with jackals (Canis aureus) and dholes (Cuon alpi- nus). Competition with dholes is especially interest- ing as dholes are of similar body size and have a similar pack structure and reproductive ecology. Thus dietary differences between Thai and Australian din- goes could be due to competition with dholes. Un- fortunately, the paucity of comparative data on the ecology of southeast Asian canids prevents resolution of this issue. Parasites, diseases, and other causes of dingo mor- tality are described in a chapter on population dy- namics. Social (e.g., infanticide) and environmental (e.g., drought) regulation of population growth as well as a variety of human control measures have 462</page><page sequence="2">J. Wildl.

Thus the forecast for Australian dingoes would seem rosy. That this is not the case is explored in Corbett's final chapter on the future of expatriate dingoes. Here Corbett documents that the greatest threat to pure dingoes is extinguishing the dingo gene pool by extensive crossbreeding with domestic dogs. Canid numbers will remain high but a larger and larger proportion of the animals will be hybrids. Eventually, few true dingoes will remain. Two unusual features accompany Corbett's text. One is a three-page, introductory summary of prin- ciple elements of dingo biology. This "Dingoes at a Glance" section puts major aspects of dingo ecology in Australia such as body size, reproduction, distri- bution, foraging, social organization, vocalizations, and human influence in one place and will make for handy reference. The second feature is more common in current text books. Interspersed in the text are offset boxes that provide background information for technical dis- cussions or add tangential material. Corbett's boxes cover the following topics: process of domestication; definitions of symbiosis, commensalism, mutualism, and parasitism; taxonomy of Canis; coat-color defi- nitions; dog coat-color genetics; how to do DNA fin- gerprinting; spectograms of howls; categories of dingo prey, both by size and type; foraging theory; drought and extinction of native Australian mammals; defi- nitions of regulation, limitation, and human man- agement of wildlife populations; theory of predator- dependent limitation of prey populations; the Thai ridgeback dog; distinctions between domestication versus taming and native versus indigenous. These boxes should effectively bridge the gap between gen- eralist and specialist readers. Numerous maps, diagrams, tables, graphs, pie charts, and sketches provide extensive quantitative documentation as well as illustration of theoretical concepts. Frank Knight's black and white sketches of dingo behaviors are excellent. Color photographs of culled and live dingoes primarily document coat color patterns, but also illustrate specific behaviors and re- lationships with humans. The latter includes slaugh- tering dingoes for meat in Thailand and a photo of a partially skinned calf. As references are grouped by chapter at the end of the book, finding discussion of a particular citation can be difficult. Five appendices provide a glossary of scientific names for plants and animals mentioned in the text; head length of live animals from males and females four to 147 days old and dried eye-lens weight of males and females from 152 to 501 days of age; diet as estimated by scat or stomach contents for six Aus- tralian habitats; recorded parasites and pathogens of Australian dingoes; and skull characteristics with which to identify dog, dingo, and hybrid animals. The ap- pendix on regional diets will be misleading to non- professionals because the percentage occurrence of mammals in the diet appears to be more than 100 percent in five of the six regions. The overcounts resulted when mammals of different size categories occurred in the same sample without appropriate modification of the calculations. Corbett's book is intended for a "wide audience from amateur wildlife enthusiasts to mammalogists" but is primarily directed towards Australian land owners and other members of the public interested in management of dingo populations. As a conse- quence, data are not referenced as thoroughly as more technical publications and finding the source for par- ticular observations is difficult. In addition, although the title indicates equal emphasis between Asia and Australia, Corbett's book is primarily about Austra- lian dingoes and is supplemented by relatively few observations of southeast Asian dingoes primarily from Thailand. Nonetheless, Corbett's book is an excellent synthesis of our current knowledge of Australia's yel- low dog and is a welcome addition to our collective library of the world's fauna. -Virginia Hayssen, Department of Physiology and Environmental Science, University of Nottingham, Sutton Bonington, LE12 5RD, UK and Department of Biology, Smith College, Northampton, MA 01063, USA.</page></plain_text>
