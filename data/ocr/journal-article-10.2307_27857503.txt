<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Nature of Emotions Human emotions have deep evolutionary roots, a fact that may explain their complexity and provide tools for clinical practice Robert Plutchik Almost everyone agrees that the study of emotion is one of the most confused (and still open) chapters in the history of psychology. By one estimate, more than 90 definitions of "emotion" were proposed over the course of the 20th century. If there is little consensus on the meaning of the term, it is no won der that there is much disagreement among contemporary theoreticians con cerning the best way to conceptualize emotion and interpret its role in life. In everyday human existence we con ceive of an emotion?anger, despair, joy, grief?as a feeling, an inner state. The in ternal experience of emotion is highly personal and often confusing, particular ly because several emotions may be ex perienced at the same time. Imagine, then, how difficult the objective study of emotion must be. Most of us often censor our own thoughts and feelings, and we have learned to be cautious about ac cepting other people's comments about their feelings. The empirical study of a psychological phenomenon so complex and so elaborately cloaked cannot help but present a special challenge. Compounding the distrust of verbal reports of emotion are the influences of behaviorism and psychoanalysis on psy chological research. The behaviorists of the 20th century believed that the only truly reliable, objective information ob tainable from living creatures was infor mation about their behavior. A classical Robert Plutchik is professor emeritus at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and adjunct professor at the University of South Florida. He received his Ph.D. from Columbia University. He has authored or coauthored more than 260 articles, 45 chapters and eight books and has edited seven books. His research interests include the study of emotions, the study of suicide and violence and the study of the psychotherapy process.

For their part, psy choanalysts have made us aware that emotions may be repressed, inhibited or unconscious, and thus unavailable to in trospection. Finally, language itself intro duces ambiguity and does not make it easy to describe mixed emotions in an unequivocal way. The meaning of emo tion terms is often obscure. For example, many people are not sure about the dif ferences between fear and anxiety, guilt and shame, or envy and jealousy. As a result, we often resort to metaphor to at tempt to describe emotion. Think, for ex ample, of such expressions as "blowing off steam," "hating someone's guts," "pain in the neck," "lump in the throat" and "a broken heart." How, then, can emotion be studied and understood? The challenge of devel oping a theoretical approach is impor tant, because emotions are an essential part of who we are and how we survive; emotional distress impels people to seek help, and indeed the primary concern of psychotherapy is the repair of emotional disorders. To simply declare emotion outside the bounds of scientific study would be irresponsible. I believe that a scientific and therapeu tically useful understanding of emotions is possible. fact, there are several sci entific intellectual traditions that have dealt with this issue. There are an evolu tionary (launched by Charles Darwin), a psychophysiological (William James), a neurological (Walter Cannon) and a psy chodynamic tradition (Sigmund Freud), in addition to the cognitive perspective that began emerging in the 1950s. More recently neurobiological evidence has be gun to inform the discussion; however, identifying the structures of the brain re lated to emotion is not a theory of emo tion, nor can such a theory be built from a knowledge of the chemicals involved in mood states, just as an adequate theo ry of depression cannot be constructed simply from a knowledge of the avail ability of serotonin. As the University of Iowa neuroscientist Antonio Damasio has pointed out, when the amassing of data does not resolve a complex issue, it may be necessary to find new ways to conceptualize the problem. In my view evolutionary theory pro vides a way to unify a number of theo retical perspectives. Using the tools and methods of evolutionary biology, and pulling together information from other species, we can put emotions in a func tional framework?define them in terms of what their adaptive function might be, and thus understand better their biologi cal basis and the apparent connections between them. Some work along these lines has been widely popularized in recent years: By now we've all heard authors of best-sell ing books describe jealousy, love, anxi ety and fear in dogs, cats, chimpanzees, baboons, elephants and lions. The bes tiaries of the medieval period contained detailed descriptions of emotions in ani mals. The popular appeal of such expla nations may lie in their ability to touch a deep-seated sense of the connectedness of all living things. Although many psy chologists have warned of the dangers of anthropomorphism, recent thinking by cognitive scientists and others sees this attitude as an outdated prejudice. The Rockefeller University zoologist Donald Griffin, one of the rounders of the field of animal cognition, believes that the "charge of anthropomorphism is a conceited claim that only our species is capable of even the simplest conscious tr nking." But there is dan ger in oversimplifying: A sophisticated understanding is needed to inform clin ical practice. Over the past four decades I have pulled together evidence from various 344 American Scientist, Volume 89</page><page sequence="2">Carl Sams II/Peter Arnold, Inc. Figure 1. Great egrets in breeding plumage fight in midair, displaying the agonistic behavior that is the precursor of human emotions such as fear, anger and jealousy. Human emotions, says the author, are best viewed through an evolutionary lens, as adaptations triggered by the challenges of survival and reproduction that are part of every organism's existence. An evolutionary approach, he argues, can sort out the roles of emotion, impulse and action and, in a therapeutic setting, help people understand the circumstances in which emotions can sometimes fail in their adaptive tasks. studies to form a psychoevolutionary theory of emotion, with the goals of clar ifying what emotions are, finding ways to measure them, relating emotions to other psychological disciplines, and in forming the practice of psychotherapy. Like many concepts in science, emotions can be best understood by making infer ences from certain classes of evidence. Such inferences suggest that emotions or their evolutionary precursors (or proto types) can be found among lower ani mals as well as human beings, a fact that can provide fascinating evolutionary in sights into our emotions, moods and personality traits. They suggest further that emotion, cognition and action inter act in feedback loops and that emotion can be viewed in a structural model tied to adaptation. Evolution and Emotion What we call cognition?the activity of knowing, learning and thinking, of which emotion is a part?evolved over millions of years. Charles Darwin recog nized that the process of evolution by natural selection applied not only to anatomic structures but also to an ani mal's "mind" and expressive behav ior?a conclusion that led him to write a book on emotional expression. Those who have followed Darwin in studying the evolutionary origins of emotion have sought to understand how emo tions increase evolutionary fitness for the individual. As mentioned above, a few evolu tionary origins are easy to postulate. Fear and anxiety in people closely paral lel the state of heightened arousal of an animal who senses a predator or a threat to its offspring, a sirrdlarity that has been found in neurochemical, anatomical and imaging studies that show these states are mediated by the limbic system, the part of the central nervous system com mon to lower and higher animals. Love and emotional attachment clearly pro mote pair bonding, reproduction and parental investment, basic to evolution ary fitness in human beings. But the ori gins of some other emotions are harder to find. Is there a general principle that can be applied? The place to start might be with the de finition problem. An emotion is not sim ply a feeling state. Emotion is a complex chain of loosely connected events that be gins with a stimulus and includes feel ings, psychological changes, impulses to 2001 July-August 345</page><page sequence="3">Figure 2.

This information-gathering and prediction and other universal adaptations found in all organisms constitute prototype adaptations from which human emotion can be modeled. action and specific, goal-directed behav ior. That is to say, feelings do not happen in isolation. They are responses to sig nificant situations in an individual's life, and often they motivate actions. This de finition of emotions allows the concept to be generalized to lower animals with out difficulty. From his studies of ani mals, human infants and human adults, Darwin concluded that expressive be Figure 3. Suckling her young, a suricate meerkat mother keeps an eye on her sur roundings in a South African nature preserve, ready to protect her offspring from any threat Psychologists believe cognitive functions evolved to serve emotional and biological needs?in evolutionary terms, in order to pre dict the future more effectively. In survival sit uations cognitions and inner states such as arousal tend to be followed by impulses to ac tion?perhaps, in this case, a defensive or pro tective posture, attack or flight haviors communicate information from one animal to another about what is likely to happen; therefore they affect the chances of survival of the individual demonstrating the behavior. "Even in sects," he wrote in his 1872 book, "ex press anger, terror, jealousy, and love by their stridulations." Extending Darwin's idea a bit, I pro pose that in general, emotions are acti vated in an individual when issues of survival are raised in fact or by implica tion. Such situations include threats, at tacks, poisonous substances or the sighting of a potential mate. The effect of the emotional state is to create an in teraction between the individual and the event or stimulus that precipitated the emotion. The interaction usually takes the form of an attempt to reduce the disequilibrium and reestablish a state of comparative rest. Protozoologist Nicola Ricci of the University of Pisa in Italy pointed out in 1990 that every single-celled organ ism, from the blue-green alga to the eu karyote, is a complete, self-sufficient or ganism. Single-celled organisms are exposed to daily risks in their environ ments. They take in food, excrete waste products, avoid predators, reproduce by exchange of genes in many cases, seek safe environments and explore their microbiological world. Thus these simple organisms adapt to many of the same problems as higher, multicellular organisms. Bacteria are capable of very complex metabolic pathways, and, as Ursula Goodenough detailed in these pages in 1991, viruses and bacteria have evolved tactics of camouflage, dis traction and mimicry. Even plant cells such as green algae show defensive re actions to touch, and chemical mes sages signal everything from alarm to sexual attraction in organisms from bacteria to human beings. As one moves up the evolutionary ladder, it is remarkable to note that a small number of developmental genes can radically alter the behavior of cells and change an amoeba into a multi celled organism. Developmental biolo gist William Loomis of the University of California, San Diego, estimated in 1988 that "the important evolutionary differ ences between a guppy and a primate probably lie in only a few hundred genes." Along with the genetic continu um, and evolutionary continuities in structure, function and development, then, it is not surprising that one can dis cern a behavioral continuum. Writing in 1980, the late zoologist John Paul Scott of Bowling Green State University pointed out that it is the na ture of the environment that creates cer tain functional requirements for all or ganisms if they are to survive. Like Riori's alga, a higher organism must take in nourishment and eliminate waste products. It must distinguish between predator and prey and between a poten tial mate and a potential enemy. It must explore its environment and orient its sense organs appropriately as it takes in information about the beneficial and harmful aspects of its immediate world. Organisms that are relatively helpless at birth must have ways of mc?cating the need for care and nurturance. Only a few classes of adaptive behav ior, Scott noted, are found in most species and at most phylogenetic levels. These include eating, the fight-or-flight response, sex, caregiving and investiga tion. These patterns might be consid ered prototype adaptations. The con nections between behavior and inner states and processes are less obvious. Yet such connections can be made by in ference from a variety of evidence. This evidence includes knowledge of stimu lating conditions, the effects of behav ioral acts, knowledge of typical behav ior patterns of the individual and species, choices made when alternatives exist and reactions of other members of one's group or species. A single overt display of emotions can reflect complex states such as approach and avoidance, 346 American Scientist, Volume 89</page><page sequence="4">attack and flight, sex and aggression, or fear and pleasure. It is not necessarily easy to detect an emotional substrate in the behavior of lower animals, but nei ther is it necessary to exclude the possi bility. Emotion is far more complex than the subjective experience familiar to a human adult, and the concept of emo tion can be applied to lower animals as well as human beings. Emotions have an inherent complexity that is in part re lated to their evolutionary history. Cognition, Emotion and Evolution Any organism must determine, on the basis of limited information, whether there is food, a mate or danger in its en vironment. Depending on the predic tion made, the organism makes a deci sion to escape, to attack, to eat or to mate. The complex processes that go on in the service of biological need include receiving sensory input, evaluating it, capturing the important aspects of the information in symbols and comparing the new information with memory stores. Predicting the characteristics of environments enables organisms to prepare for those environments. Psychologist Ulric Neisser of Cornell University compared human beings with computing machines in a seminal article in 1963. He suggested that cogni tive functions serve emotions and bio logical needs. Information from the en vironment, he says, is evaluated in terms of its ability to satisfy or frustrate needs. What is particularly significant is that each new cognitive experience that is bi ologically important is connected with an emotional reaction such as fear, plea sure, pain, disgust or depression. From the point of view of evolution, cognition developed in order to predict the future more effectively. The human brain, which has evolved as an adaptation to changing and difficult environments, has now helped create the very environ ment to which it must continue to adapt. If emotion is a chain of events, cogni tion is generally near the beginning of the chain. This is considered an impor tant point in the psychological commu nity, which has put a good deal of effort stimulus event inferred -^i cognition feeling state physiological arousal into answering the "what comes first?" question, ever since the American psy chologist-philosopher William James in 1884 framed the question this way: Is it the feeling of emotion or the physiolog ical changes that are part of emotion? This is actually a pseudoproblem. Emotions are not simply linear events, but rather are feedback processes. The function of emotion is to restore the in dividual to a state of equilibrium when unexpected or unusual events create disequilibrium. Even if cognitions are generally at the beginning of the chain of events, they can be influenced by events appearing later in the chain? states of arousal, say, or ego defenses? through a feedback process. Stimulus events, either external or internal (as in dreams), act as primary triggers that start the emotion process going. The biological aspects of this process have been the subject of considerable recent study. Animal research by Joseph E. LeDoux of New York Univer sity has revealed that the conditioned fear response involves several neural J impulses _jf 1 to action *1 overt behavior (displays) effect T^P ? ? ? Figure 4. Feedback loops in emotion show how sensory information is evaluated and translated into action or some other outcome that nor malizes the relationship between the individual and the triggering event. The inner state perceived as fear may arise from a threat that is per ceived as "danger"; the fear triggers an impulse to flee, which results eventually in reduction of the threat. A similar set of homeostatic processes can be seen in the case of sadness in a child experiencing loss of her mother. 2001 July-August 347</page><page sequence="5">Stimulus event cognition feeling state overt behavior Figure 5. Although emotional substrates cannot always be discerned in the behavior of non human animals, many stimuli are experienced by people and animals alike and result in pro totypical behavior followed by, generally, the reestablishment of an equilibrium state that might not have been achieved without the impulse precipitated by the inner state. In human experience it is common to use the term "emotion" to describe the feeling state, but in fact emotion is considerably more complex. pathways with different latencies. Damasio has traced the events in an ini tial defensive response (fear): The key features of a dangerous animal or event?perhaps color, speed of move ment, certain sounds?are detected and signaled to the amygdala, a part of the limbic system deep in the brain. This process is very rapid and is not a con scious one. Signals from the amygdala to premontai areas and other locations precipitate the conscious feelings asso ciated with an emotion. Feeling states tend to be followed by impulses to action. Emotion can cause one's muscles to tense; it can be ex pressed as a facial gesture, clenched fist or an action such as running, attacking or yelling. Impulses to action are not always followed by action, as clinicians know? often for fear of retaliation or embarrass ment. Even when they are, overt behav ior is not the end of the emotion process. Such behavior generally has an effect on the stimulus or condition that started the chain of events in the first place. For example, running from a source of threat reduces the threat and tends to reestablish the condition that existed be fore the threat. Similarly, if someone los es a parent, crying and grieving tend to elicit supportive and helpful contacts from members of the grieving person's social group and, at least in a symbolic way, provide a sort of reattachment with the lost parent and thus a change in the feeling state. Overall, emotion is a kind of homeo static process in which behavior medi ates progress toward equilibrium; I call it a behavioral homeostatic, negative feedback system. Emotion is a chain of events made up of feedback loops. Feel ings and behavior can affect cognition, just as cognition can influence feeling. At the heart of all these descriptions is the idea that emotions have a function in the lives of individuals. This idea arises from an evolutionary perspective, is con sistent with psychodynamic thinking and is becoming increasingly accepted in con temporary writings. For example, young organisms require food, protection and transportation. Crying is a major method for getting such care. Fear protects the self, initiates withdrawal and allows gen eral functioning to continue. Shame leads to remorse and a decrease in the proba bility of repetition of the shameful act. These examples imply that emotions are part of a social regulation process. Evolutionary theory reminds us that the interests of different individuals are of ten in conflict: males versus females, parents versus children, brothers versus brothers, group versus group. Genes are "selfish" and concerned with self-main tenance and self-reproduction. Social in teractions and communications reflect this conflict. Listening and speaking are regulated by direct and subtle expres sions of emotion?smiles, eye contact or looking away, nods, postural shifts, vo calizations, passive questions and im plicit commands ("Why don't you wear a hearing aid?"). Much social interaction involves in dividuals in different hierarchical po sitions. In such situations, during con versation there is often a censoring of rebellious thoughts, and a covert compe tition of ideas. An individual may expe rience feelings of defiance or may accept a submissive position. Emotions, at both conscious and unconscious levels, regu late such social processes. Another way to conceptualize emo tions as a social-regulation process is in terms of the views of animal communi cation proposed by Eugene Morton of the Smithsonian Institution and his col leagues. They point out that communi cation is an assessment/management process aimed at survival. Communica tion signals are selected in evolution be cause they substitute for more risky be havior such as fighting. California ground squirrels stimulate a rattlesnake to rattle by kicking earth at it. This is done because squirrels use the sound of rattling to assess the snake's size and body temperature, two factors that determine how dangerous the snake is to their pups. With many ani mals, distress calls are adaptive because they may startle a predator into letting go, may attract the attention of other conspecifics to mob the predator, or may attract a larger predator to compete and possibly allow escape. However, it is not always easy to determine the adaptive nature of a given signal. Emotions are part of the management of the process. Anger, for example, in timidates, influences others to do some thing you wish them to do, energizes an individual for attack or defense and spaces the participants in a conflict. Modeling the Emotions I have used the term "emotion" as a sin gle, general term for a group of phenom ena. As complex processes with func tional value both in communication and in increasing the individual's chances of survival, emotions represent proximate methods to achieve evolutionary fitness. To integrate many of the things known about emotions, model-making is useful. 348 American Scientist, Volume 89</page><page sequence="6">English there are a few hundred emotion words, and they tend to fall into families based on similarity. I have found that the primary emotions can be con ceptualized in a fashion analogous to a color wheel?placing similar emotions close together and opposites 180 degrees apart, like complementary colors. Other emotions are mixtures of the primary emotions, just as some colors are prima ry and others made by mixing the pri mary colors. Such "circumplex" model ing can be used as an analytical tool in understanding personality as well, and the similarity between the two models is important. I have extended the circum plex model into a third dimension, rep resenting the intensity of emotions, so that the total so-called structural model of emotions is shaped like a cone. The notion of a ckcumplex model is not my invention, nor is it new. Social psychologist William McDougall noted the parallel between emotions and colors in 1921, writing that "the color sensations present, like the emotions, an ^definitely great variety of qualities shading into one another by imperceptible gradients...." The first drcumplex model was one de veloped by Brown University psycholo gist Harold Schlosberg in 1941, after he had asked research participants to judge the emotions posed in a standard set of pictures of facial expression. Schlosberg added the intensity dimension to his model. My own model was proposed in 1958, when I suggested eight basic bipo lar emotions: joy versus sonozv, anger ver sus fear, acceptance versus disgust and sur prise versus expectancy. Over the centuries, from Descartes to the present, philosophers and psycholo gists have proposed anywhere from 3 to 11 emotions as primary or basic. All the lists include/eflr, anger and sadness-, most include joy, love and surpnse. There is no unequivocal way to settle on a precise number, although factor-analytic stud ies, sirn?arity-scaling studies, child-de velopment studies and cross-cultural studies are useful. But in the final analy sis, this is a theoretical decision to be Figure 7. To help psychologists understand the relations among emotions, raters were asked to estimate the degree of similarity be tween certain pairs of emotions. The use of a similarity scaling method produced the em pirical angular locations shown in the figure (where opposites have a similarity ranking of -1.0 and identical concepts have a similarity ranking of 1.0). The concepts shown are a se lection from a larger population of words. Figure 6. Author's three-dimensional circumplex model describes the relations among emotion concepts, which are analogous to the colors on a color wheel. The cone's vertical dimension rep resents intensity, and the circle represents degrees of similarity among the emotions. The eight sectors are designed to indicate that there are eight primary emotion dimensions defined by the theory arranged as four pairs of opposites. In the exploded model the emotions in the blank spaces are the primary dyads?emotions that are mixtures of two of the primary emotions. 2001 July-August 349</page><page sequence="7">evaluated in terms of the inferences and insights to which it leads, the research it suggests and the extent to which empir ical data are consistent with it. The psy choevolutionary theory assumes there are eight basic emotion dimensions arranged in four pairs. If there are eight basic emotion dimen sions (each with a number of synonyms or related terms), how can we account for the total language of emotions? Vari ous published studies imply that the few hundred emotion words tend to fall into families based on similarity If we follow the pattern used in color theory and re search, we can obtain judgments about combinations?the emotions that result when two or more fundamental emo tions are combined, in the same way that red and blue make purple. Judges in these studies have agreed that mixing joy and acceptance produces the mixed emo tion of love; disgust plus anger produces hatred or hostility. Such mixtures have been called primary dyads in the theory One can continue on this way and ac count for hundreds of emotion terms by mixing two or more emotions at differ ent levels of intensity As noted above, it is interesting and perhaps important that one of the hy potheses generated from this structural model is that personality traits should have a similar structure. Again we can take cues from language. Although per sonality is usually taught in universities as if it had little or nothing to do with emotions, words such as gloomy, resent ful, anxious and calm can describe person ality traits as well as emotional states. An individual can feel depressed, or be a de pressed person, feel nervous or be a ner vous person. Often people are able to measure both emotional states and per sonality traits using the same checklist of adjectives, with a simple change in in structions. When research participants are asked how they feel now, or within the past few days, the instruction asks for a self-report of an emotional state or a mood. But they can be asked how they usually feel, a question that yields infor mation about personality traits. At the extremes are pathological states such as mania and paranoia?but even these can be conceived as extreme expressions of such basic emotions as sadness, joy and disgust. Thus personality traits may be conceptualized as being derived from mixtures of emotions. With my colleague Hope Conte, I have been able to find a circumplex structure for certain classes of personality traits. Furthermore, in recent years there have been more than 100 published studies concerned with identifying per sonality characteristics in lower ani mals. Of course lower animals probably should be said to have temperament rather than "personality/' but extraver si?n, emotional stability and agreeable ness have shown considerable generali ty across species. Samuel Gosling of the University of Texas at Austin and Oliver John of the University of California, Berkeley, have identified extraversion and emotional stability as characteris tics of animals as low on the phyloge netic scale as guppies and octopuses. Some Implications An evolutionary framework supplies the study of emotions with such con cepts as functional thinking, the gener ality of mechanisms across phyla, de velopmental theory (to explain, for instance, attachment), and the concepts of inclusive fitness and proximate and ultimate causation. Happily, in combination with the se quential, structural and derivative sys tems described above, evolutionary the ory can provide not only a way of organizing data in the fields of emotion, personality and psychopathology, but also new tools for clinical practice. A therapist must uncover and identi fy emotions. An evolutionary approach suggests that the subjective feeling states of emotion (the labels they are given) are usually more ambiguous and obscure than are the associated impulses to ac tion. We need not insist like the behav iorists that only overt behavior is suit able for study; however, impulses to action may be probed whether or not the action takes place. In addition, successful adaptation im plies the ability to feel and express all emotions in appropriate settings. Applied to emotion, the societal dictate that "there is a time and a place for everything" ac tually encapsulates the idea that all emo tions can be adaptive within human soci ety. It is a matter of sorting out the specific circumstances in which emotions can sometimes fail in their adaptive tasks The psychoevolutionary theory has guided the development of tests for measuring moods, personality traits, ego defenses and coping styles. It has also proposed a connection between emotions and the existential crises that all human beings are subject to?those involving hierarchy, territoriality, identi ty and temporality.
