<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Chicago Gangster Theory of Life Andrew Ross Hardly a month goes by without some heady news announcement that scien- tists have isolated "the gene" responsible for this or that life-threatening dis- ease. Nature has offered up another secret to the intrepid seeker of knowledge. When all else is called into doubt, progress is surely reliable and unsullied in this sector of human endeavor. Things are on the right track after all. And yet, it is reported, there will always be naysayers: we can put men and women on the moon, but we can't feed our own . . . we can restructure human DNA but we can't provide minimal medical care.... There are also those who, for some reason of ethical faith, are the modern equivalent of flat earthers: nature wasn't meant to be tampered with. Worst of all, there are even some, although this is rarely reported, who dispute the whole idea behind the "genetic" way of look- ing at the world that is rapidly becoming second nature. Readers of this journal are likely to fall into any of these three categories. This essay falls into the latter. It argues that the resurgent biologism that has accompanied the gene boom in recent years is a major feature of the new poli- tics of nature that will consume our energies well into the next century. In dis- cussing the reactionary elements of biotechnology, sociobiology, evolutionary biology, and environmentalism, it traces some of the historical and political components of this new politics, and suggests ways of challenging the growing reliance on the authority of "nature" to deal with problems that are primarily social in origin and development. Gene-Analogies The secrets of DNA, as science's heroic narrative would put it, began to unravel in 1953, only five years after the discovery of the semiconductor. The eco- nomic consequences of the latter are all too apparent today, in the widespread technological infrastructure of the information society, fueled by relentless consumer marketing of successive generations of high technology. By contrast, the much vaunted genetic revolution still has little to show in the way of mate- rial product. What lies, submerged, beneath all of the public hullabaloo raised about the ethics of biotechnologies and all of the heady, Promethean hype that still attends the commercial evangelizing of the idea of biological engineering</page><page sequence="2">94 Chicago Gangster Theory of Life is a story about the early career of the genetic revolution as an inflationary vic- tim of the checkered fortunes of venture capitalism in the 1980s.I Conceived from the outset as an entrepreneurial science (the term biotech- nology was coined on Wall Street), funded by corporate investors to avoid the demanding peer-review system of federally funded science, the research and development of biologicals was supposed to create an economic harvest as profitable as the microelectronics industry had done, while producing the magic bullets needed for everything up to and including a comprehensive can- cer cure. Aside from providing a much-needed stimulant to a stock market still trailing in the wake of the energy crises of the 1970s, the discoveries of gene splicing and recombinant DNA technology were supposed to lead to miracle bioweaponry in the new immunological wars, and, eventually, realize mil- lenarian dreams of eliminating genetic disease, feeding the world, and saving the planet. Hosannas of praise for the gene fed off the same rhetoric of techno- logical utopianism as selling the atom had done in the postwar years. Projec- tions of vast profits from the gene boom were underpinned by public assur- ances that the vehicles for this biorevolution were environmentally friendly technologies, at least by the standards of the chemical industry. Consequently, the initial levels of investment in the wave of new biomedical companies like Genentech were unprecedented on Wall Street; a chorus of investors, execu- tives, and industry boosters in the early 1980s feverishly intoned the mantras of molecular biology as if it were some new kind of alchemy. Within a few years this wild first boom was over, having produced meager profits and little more in the way of biomedical products than a set of mono- clonal diagnostics and a few limited antibody therapy treatments. Investors cut their losses and retreated to the blue chip stocks, while the 1987 crash took its toll on the smaller venture capitalist outfits, leaving the older biochemical drug empires intact, and, in many cases, stronger than ever. Of course, biotechnol- ogy companies recovered and, in 1991, sold $17.7 billion in new stocks; a remarkable performance, as the Wall Street Journal might have put it, espe- cially in a recession year. The industry was also exerting enough collective political pressure to ensure that President Bush refused to sign the biodiversity treaty at the Rio Earth Summit. Among other things, the treaty would have required American biotech companies in the gene-hunting business of patent- ing seeds and plants to share profits with countries which host the flora and fauna that are the biological capital of the global industry. Is there anything to learn from the first wave of the genetic revolution? You can take your pick. Either Wall Street lost its nerve, or the cold reality of sci- ence collided fatefully with the hot air of the hype. In the case of biotechnol- ogy, at least, there is no easy way of distinguishing between the two explana- tions; the possible economics of the science fed off the economic science of possibility, demonstrating that access to and monopoly control of R&amp;D in basic science is the primary motor of corporate-military investment today.</page><page sequence="3">Andrew Ross 95 Such short-term cycles of boom and bust tell a story about how science, increasingly, is defined, funded, and practiced. Biotechnology, after all, was the first major new field in science to emerge after, and largely as a result of, the monetarists' transformation of the status of basic science from that of pub- lic knowledge to corporate commodity, a private status hitherto applied only to marketable technology. It stands, then, as a clear warning about the risks of technologically developing a new science wholly within the fickle milieu of corporate culture. As if to respond to the caveat, the North American branch of the Human Genome project, the large-scale undertaking to map and sequence all of the genes in human DNA, has been almost entirely funded by federal grants and appropriations, and at levels unmatched since the space race. National chauvinism, as in the space race, and bureaucratic will to power, as in most sectors of knowledge about the body, have also played their role in secur- ing the interest of the state in this form of "big science." Critics who question the worth of this project point, among other things, to its astronomical cost, its low expectancy of usable scientific knowledge, and its potential for commer- cial abuse. In addition, because the project is mapping the sequence of only one set of genes-a composite male of American, European, and Japanese ori- gin-there are serious problems with what many perceive to be its violation of evolutionary codes of natural variation in the species. Nonetheless, a 3 percent portion of its monstrous National Institute of Health (NIH) budget has been set aside for studying the ethical implications of the project, while the directorship of the project was initially entrusted to James Watson, bearer of biology's most unim- peachable pedigree (pace Rosalind Franklin). The result of this unprecedented allocation, in the form of in-house conferences and symposia, has been to establish, for the project and its contractors, a kind of immunity to scrutiny and interrogation from external critics. On the other hand, it is a measure of the extent to which its advocates are now seeking safe passage for the career of biotechnology, after initial excursions along the rocky roads, respectively, of Judeo-Christian ethics and venture capitalism. However relevant and important, a strictly economic account of the first biotechnology boom is not the whole story. Technologies are no more the blue sky fantasies of financial speculators than they are the single determining source of economic revolutions, as is often supposed in the case of the semi- conductor or microprocessor. Technologies are as much the results of signifi- cant changes in social and cultural values as they are ingenious responses to physical conditions, industrial demands, or environmental problems. Biomedi- cal technologies, in particular, can be seen as the integrated products of vast phases or regimes (after Aglietta) of environmental life. These regimes can be either labor-related, like the industrial revolution with its affiliated bodily con- tagions, and the postindustrial revolution with its stress-related or immunologi- cal disorders, or they can be lifestyle-related, like the so-called sexual revolu- tion, with its associated infectious diseases, and microbiological conditions.</page><page sequence="4">96 Chicago Gangster Theory of Life But it is equally reductive to think about such regimes without also considering how they are associated historically, with ideologies of the body, whether popu- lar or elite, whether mechanistic or organicist. For example, the recent appear- ance of the concept of the "genetic disease" (diseases attributed to a single recessive gene, or a set of genes), and thus of the new hereditarian definitions of the body encouraged by molecular biologists, is indissociable from the explosive growth of genetic biomedicine. Without this conceptual picture of the body as genetically determined, we would not have the dire situation that exists today in biomedicine, where the providers of technological fixes in the form of gene therapies are desperately searching for problems-genetic dis- eases-in the hope of boosting their stocks. Science chases its own tail in hot pursuit of profit. The logic is the same as it was for Edison, but the stakes are arguably much higher, given what genetic technologies are capable of intro- ducing into the open environment. This most recent example of inverted priorities-the solution looking for a problem-is mostly a consequence of a conceptual shift from a germ theory to a gene theory of disease. The new theory is as culturally and socially deter- mined as the old, and is having an equally massive effect upon the way in which people think of their bodies. Such ideologies of the body are an essential part of the process by which persuasive consent is solicited for the develop- ment of any new technology. In this respect, one is tempted to speculate that the initial commercial rise and fall of biotechnology had something to do with its cultural prematurity, and that the high level of public anxiety about the ethics of "going against nature," as it is often articulated, is a sign that the decisive winning of consent for such technologies still lies somewhere in the future. People still want to think of their bodies as organically inviolate or inalienable, and seem to be resistant, whether on religious or secular grounds, to the idea that their DNA can or ought to be genetically manipulated. On the other hand, the popular appeal of a simple technological fix-one gene for each disease- tends to override this skepticism, not to mention the much messier political commitment to a welfare system that might guarantee each individual's social right to health. As for the scientific community, fears about the hazards of biotechnology were at one time more widely shared among professional scien- tists than they are today. As early as 1975, a meeting of two hundred leading researchers was convened in Asilomar, California, in order to consider the bio- hazards of recombinant DNA, and to lift an unofficial moratorium on gene manipulation experiments called for by a committee the year before. In spite of the widespread ambivalence toward biotechnology, I don't intend to downplay the power of capital investment to override public or professional skepticism. Increasingly, the eyes are on the patent. In the case of the gene boom, however, one could conjecture that the economic model for R&amp;D of biologicals was tied too much, initially, to the example of industrial prece- dents, especially that of microelectronics. The ground rhythm of the biogenetic</page><page sequence="5">Andrew Ross 97 revolution is conceivably much slower and much broader in its effects than could be encompassed by the short-term forecasting framework of the venture capitalist, who has to accept daily the "burn rate" of basic research as a loss against marketable returns in the near future. But the problem may also be related to a more fundamental difference between these two industrial revolu- tions-the microelectronic one based on industrially rationalizing the control and distribution of information in the name of a surveillance society, the genetic one based on the specific control of nature through manipulation of biological material in the name of the industrialization of life itself. While both revolutions were forged in a militarist culture (basic research for each came out of wartime programs, and in the case of Watson's DNA research, more or less directly from the Atomic Energy Commission) and while both bear the mark of their status as militarist offspring, official and popular disapproval of bioweaponry for explicitly military purposes is still widely observed. While populations seem all too willing to accept the logic of using nuclear weaponry, environmental warfare, and all manner of electronically smart armaments, by contrast, nerve, toxinigenic, chemical, or biological instruments of war are considered to lie outside the rules of the game, even after over fifty years of expensive research and testing of such weapons, often on civilian populations in peacetime. The battle for the morally legitimate use of such weapons in war has yet to be won by the generals and the bankers. Back to Biologism If, in general, the development of biotechnology is somewhat out of sync with its sticky reception in the culture at large, there are good reasons for this dis- crepancy. Social questions about biology increasingly are at the dead center of debates about cultural politics today. After decades of dominance by the schools of culturalism, environmentalism, and social constructionism, the revival of biological determinism from the slough of disrepute has been mer- curial, and has followed close on the heels of the gene boom and the rise to centrality of the field of genetics within the life sciences. This powerful resur- rection of biologism has consequences for some of the great philosophical debates of the day; from debates about essentialism and identity politics among cultural thinkers and political activists, to debates about biocentrism between social ecologists and deep ecologists/ecofeminists. In matters of pub- lic policy, biologism has been a central player in the struggles over reproduc- tive rights; it is omnipresent in the crusades against sexual minorities, and lies only partially submerged in the racist campaigns against affirmative action and civil rights; in general, the potential for genetic screening of the population covers so many areas of life that it has already raised concerns about privacy and discrimination of all forms to new levels of public consideration. As for the broader implications of the development of genetic technologies, crucial</page><page sequence="6">98 Chicago Gangster Theory of Life issues of global ecology are directly involved: plans for population control, violations of animal welfare, the disaster of monocultural food production, loss of biodiversity, intensification of Third World underdevelopment, and the cor- poratization of health care.2 Behind all of this lurks the unsavory history of genetics itself, with its hideous roots in the eugenics movements of the first few decades of this century.3 For those of us accustomed to debating the politics of culture, the new biolo- gism's most obvious challenge is to the comfort once provided by the old nature/culture boundaries, which, however contested, could still be relied upon to deliver demarcated spheres, with culture usually on the winning side. For most of the postwar period, it seems, biology has not been considered destiny, and the civil freedoms, cultural permissions, and political rights achieved in that period have been sustained against attacks by fundamentalists arguing in the universalist name of "human nature." Generally speaking, it has not been difficult to demonstrate how spurious such arguments from human nature are, although the persistence of popular belief in the existence of "human nature" has proved a more formidable and enduring obstacle to claims that all appeals to this concept are fashioned out of nothing more than ideology. Increasingly, however, the arguments made from nature are made on the basis and authority of the new genetic science, and so the terms of the debate appear to have changed. Biology's new capacity to synthesize and alter molecules has threat- ened to shatter the conceptual picture of nature as immutable and degenerate. As Evelyn Fox Keller has pointed out, the new picture of nature as more mal- leable, and less fixed, is one in which nature can be presented as a realm of freedom and improvement where before it was cast as a region of necessity and imperfection.4 As a result, the nature-nurture debates no longer look quite the same; the ground on either side seems less sure. Not that it was at all clear why freedom and necessity should have been so opposed in the first place. Necessity usually includes some conception of human needs, but who will decide whether specific needs are socially created or whether they respond to conditions of survival tied to "natural" scarcity? Conversely, there are many who view freedom as a direct consequence of the potential offered by human biology, rather than as a bonus to be achieved in the face of resistance from human biology. In seeking firmer ground beyond the quicksands of philosophical debate, culturalists have challenged the objective bases of genetic science itself, uncovering the social and ideological assumptions that saturate its purportedly neutral, positivist principles, while reminding us of its debt not only to the eugenics movements of the past but also to the ascendant values of today's neoconservatism. They have also had to respond to the emergent shape of the new eugenics, achieved this time not through social control, but through tech- nology, and aimed at bringing everyone up to genetic par rather than sterilizing those who bring down the quality of the gene pool.</page><page sequence="7">Andrew Ross 99 In the process of this wrangling, however, a more sophisticated "politics of nature" has emerged, and in a very timely fashion too as we speed through what both apocalyptics and reformists have termed the decade of the environ- ment. This politics of nature covers a wide spectrum of issues and contexts, and must be specific to each in its own right. The full diversity of these issues notwithstanding, I propose here to follow through the consequences of one of the most recurring general problems, posed most crudely in the following way. How should we respond to the new arguments made from nature when they are carried over into the nonnatural environments of our social, cultural, and politi- cal lives? Surely we cannot continue to dismiss such reasoning as the work of false metaphor-as in the "animal kingdom" (from culture to nature) or as in "visual pollution" (from nature to culture)-and least of all, if we still want to call ourselves materialists-if we want to believe, for example, that the eco- logical crisis is not simply a cultural construction. The question here is not simply how to resolve the recent face-off between devotees of rhetoric and lovers of materialism. What is more important is to understand how such lim- ited and patently abstract choices come to be posed as the dominant ones. To do so involves first assessing critically specific histories of thought that are associated with particular metaphors and particular concepts of materiality (for example, Darwin's metaphor of selection and anthropomorphic ideas of nature, or the unDarwinian equation of social Darwinism that binds the process of organic variation to social progress).5 The second step is to suggest alternative legacies and alternative frameworks for rescuing the use of natural science from its role as legislator or legitimator of bad thought. One important case history to consider in this regard is the controversial career of sociobiology. Sociobiology's Legacy There may be no easy way of reconciling what conservation biologists mean by "nature," what sociobiologists or economists mean by "nature," and what poets or politicians mean by "nature," but one way of gauging the significance of these differences is to look at the disciplinary wars involving disputes over this terrain. Consider the opening lines of the infamous last chapter of Edward O. Wilson's 1975 book Sociobiology, where Wilson moves from analysis of animal societies to addressing the features of human societies: Let us now consider man in the free spirit of natural history, as though we were zoologists from another planet completing a catalog of social species on Earth. In this macroscopic view the humanities and the social sciences shrink to specialized branches of biology: history, biography, and fiction are the protocols of human ethology: and anthropology and sociology together constitute the sociobiology of a single primate species.6 If the consequences of such remarks by Wilson and his disciples had not been</page><page sequence="8">100 Chicago Gangster Theory of Life so serious, one might be excused for reading this passage as a bad taste parody of some university administrator's attempts, under the pressure of shrinking budgets, to collapse and merge departments and disciplines, thereby rearrang- ing the campus map into the bargain. The fact that university departments, for the most part, still inhabit the same buildings as they did two decades ago has more to do with institutional inertia than with resistance to the colonizing arro- gance of the Wilsonians in the life sciences, or the corresponding desire of social scientists to put their discipline on a wholly scientific basis. But there is more to this than parody. Wilson's proposal to collapse the disciplines in this manner stems from his general acceptance of reductionism, and specifically from his picture of the pyramid of knowledge, with social sciences at the top and physics at the bottom; sociology could thus be derived from biology, from chemistry, and ultimately, from the fundamental physical laws. The whole pyramid resonates in a single chain of causation in the same way as sociobiol- ogy's explanation of human nature reduces itself to the smallest genetic com- ponent of the constituent cell. Wilson's own work had proceeded from his lifelong fascination, as an ento- mologist, with the highly organized structure of insect "societies" that appear to resemble one single superorganism made up of selfless organisms. Such societies, with deeply programmed "altruism," did not appear to make sense in the conventional terms of natural selection until William Hamilton advanced the theory of kin selection in 1964. According to sociobiology's version of this theory, the unit of natural selection is not the individual but the gene itself, and so individual sacrifices among social insects for the sake of siblings who share the altruistic gene aid in the survival of the gene. Animal behavior evolves in such a way as to encourage kin selection, since the survival of the gene is all. This view is taken to its extreme in the "gene's eye view of life" popularized by Richard Dawkins, for whom all organisms "are survival machines-robot ve- hicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes."7 Kin selection, which supports the principle of inclusive fitness rather than individual fitness, opened the door for sociobiology to argue the case for the ulti- mately hereditary basis of social behavior. The way was then clear for Wilson to reduce the ethical systems of human society to biological causes and locations: [M]orality evolved as instinct. If that perception is correct, science may soon be in a position to investigate the very origin and meaning of human values, from which all ethical pronouncements and much of political practice flow. ... [Morality] resides in the deep emotional centers of the brain, most probably within the limbic system, a com- plex array of neurons and hormone-secreting cells located just beneath the "thinking" portion of the cerebral cortex.8 The resulting view of genetic determination is as far removed as can be from the culturalists' picture of humans socialized by their environments. What are the stakes of the argument, advanced by Wilson and others, that traits</page><page sequence="9">Andrew Ross 101 like militarism, social competition, sexual dominance, territorialism, xenopho- bia, and the like are genetically encoded in humans? To begin with, general theories that "biology is destiny" bear the odious burden of their enduring his- torical use as justifications for imperialism, genocide, and patriarchal domina- tion, while the most recent revival of biological determinism has fed directly into the social Darwinist climate of the New Right's sanctification of posses- sive individualism. Aside, then, from the continuity of sociobiology with the selective breeding doctrines of eugenics, only temporarily rendered persona non grata by the Nazi example, the current revival of theories based on the her- itability of differences has marched in tune with the neoconservative faith about the permanence of social inequalities. Biological determinism, which defines individuals as the consequence of the biochemical properties of their constituent cells, seems to be a scientific correlate of the New Right dogma that society, far from being an organic community whose members hold rights and responsibilities, is simply a Hobbesian collection of naturally competitive individuals with no reciprocal obligations.9 No one really needed an article like "A Genetic Defense of the Free Market," which almost inevitably appeared in the wake of the sociobiology brouhaha (in Business Week, 10 April 1978), to recognize the degree to which sociobiology was very much an idea of its times. Subsequently, genetics has been used to naturalize ideas about dif- ferences of race (the IQ debates, and anti-immigrationism), gender (in the campaign against ERA), morality ("criminal" chromosomes-the XYY geno- type), sexuality (homosexuality both as a genetic error and, more recently, as a genetically determined compulsion), and class (concentration of "good" genes at the uppermost socioeconomic levels). A direct correspondence is suggested between genetic diversity, such as it exists, and social diversity, thereby con- sidered to be predetermined. Consequently, it is assumed in general that there are "natural" levels of social attainment for people just as there are "natural" limits to their social capacity. More visibly, victims of social discrimination are once again blamed, this time for their presumed biological inferiority. Despite the burgeoning success of this field, almost every tenet of sociobi- ology has been strongly rebutted, and from many quarters.10 In responding, sociobiologists have resented the public criticism of the adoption of their theories to justify the continued inequalities of patriarchal capitalism. Science, and the pure logic of its internal developments, is their domain, they say, and they regret the "contamination" of their work by the external discourse of social advocates. There is no easy separation of these discourses, however, least of all in the case of sociobiology. The science, from the beginning, is heavily contaminated. What is the "free spirit of natural history" invoked by Wilson when it can only be imagined as the perspective of a "zoologist from another planet"? The result, in the case of human perspectives, is a vicious circle of hypothesis. Aggression, territoriality, competition, tribalism, mili- tarism, and sexual and social domination-on which social institutions are</page><page sequence="10">102 Chicago Gangster Theory of Life based-are assumed to be universal human traits, for which a genetic cause is sought and then offered as a scientific explanation of the universality of these traits. The most common intermediate move in this "proof"' is to apply these traits to nonhuman societies, where, Lewontin, Kamin, and Rose argue, pat- terns derivative of human social institutions are projected onto animal societies and then "human behavior is rederived from the animals as if it were a special case of a general phenomenon that had been independently discovered in other species."" The general tendency to anthropomorphize the "animal kingdom" with social hierarchies and structures of domination and submission-like caste, royalty, and slavery-is a problem that is hardly confined to Disney nature films: it is a fundamental principle of sociobiological discourse. The language of sociobiology suggests relations of identity between human and animal societies and an underlying structure of genetic causality. At best, how- ever, there are only analogies to be found between these different types of species organization, and such analogies should only be used sparingly as rules of thumb for talking about the social behavior of organisms. Given the spirit of projection involved in the sociobiologists' process of reasoning, it is no surprise to find the gene itself being proposed as a bearer of human attributes. The most famous example is Richard Dawkins's description of the "selfish gene": If we were told that a man had lived a long and prosperous life in the world of Chicago gangsters, we would be entitled to make some guesses as to what sort of man he was. We might expect that he would have qualities such as toughness, a quick trigger finger, and an ability to attract loyal friends. These would not be infallible deductions, but you can make some inferences about a man's character if you know something about the conditions in which he has survived and pros- pered. The argument of this book is that we, and all other animals, are machines created by our genes. Like successful Chicago gangsters, our genes have survived, in some cases, for millions of years, in a highly competitive world. This entitles us to expect certain qualities in our genes. I argue that a predominant quality to be expected in a successful gene is ruthless selfishness. This gene selfishness will usually give rise to selfishness in individual behavior.12 How does one respond to this description? In the spirit of generosity, I imme- diately think of more appropriate types for this comparison-a naked apologist for corporate capitalism like John D. Rockefeller, or a junk bond monster like Michael Milken. Then I stop to consider the historical pertinence of the actual type selected by Dawkins, for whom the type of the Chicago gangster is no doubt as exotic to his own type-the Oxford don-as a Polynesian navigator, an Eskimo fisher, or a Pygmy tribesman from Zaire might be. The historical heyday of the type was indeed in the hot moment of social Darwinism in the 1920s, amid massive immigration, urbanization, high racialism, labor repres- sion, and wild financial speculation at the fragile altar of monopoly capital-</page><page sequence="11">Andrew Ross 103 ism-"the jungle," in other words, to borrow Upton Sinclair's term for another invidious Chicago institution of the time. Perhaps this is more or less the kind of Hobbesian environment Dawkins has in mind when he appeals to the "con- ditions" in which said type "has survived and prospered." But even if we were to follow up on Dawkins's coy invocation of strict environmental determinism, there would be a rather different story to tell about the evolution of the social institutions usually associated with organized crime in this country. The gang- ster, far from being the epitome of the selfish, atomized individual, is more like the "big man" of the organized syndicates that once functioned (and to some extent still do) as support networks within and across communities. In the absence, or the corrupt semi-presence, of official institutions like the welfare state in the domestic economy, law enforcement on the streets, and trade union protection in the labor economy, such networks functioned as a medium of self-government or parallel government for communities forced into the alter- native circuit of the informal economy. Strengthened further by the force of expanded family ties and cohesive ethnic loyalties, the crime syndicates epito- mized by the term "Chicago gangster" therefore had a crucial role to play in a period before the state apparatus of the social welfare contract was put in place in the immediate prewar and postwar years. To abstract the selfish, atomistic figure suggested by Dawkins's Chicago gangster from the social and quasi- institutional environments in which the gangster functioned is dishonest, but not unusual if one is trading in types. Simply assuming the worst about the type, Dawkins himself makes no effort to flesh out a social profile for his Chicago gangster. Writing in the mid-seventies, however, in the so-called "winters of discontent" produced by labor disputes in Britain, he does make a number of aside references to the example of industrial action as a test case of the debate about group altruism and selfishness. In Dawkins's discussion, the labor movement is an exemplary milieu for demonstrating how selfish indi- viduals always seem to be able to prosper under conditions ostensibly dedi- cated to the principle of mutual aid: We may frequently behave selfishly as individuals, but in our more idealistic moments we honour and admire those who put the welfare of others first. We get a bit muddled over how widely we want to interpret the word "others," though. Often altruism within a group goes with selfishness between groups. This is a basis of trade unionism.13 There are many other bases of trade unionism, however, which fall outside of the perilous passage between the Scylla and Charybdis of altruism and selfish- ness. These other bases are related, on the one hand, to the Enlightenment tra- dition of claiming social rights and civil freedoms independent of local cir- cumstances of gain and loss, and, on the other hand, to a more utopian tradition that seeks to create a society where equality and cooperation are more norma- tive governors of behavior than prejudice and competition. These traditions</page><page sequence="12">104 Chicago Gangster Theory of Life evolved, historically, out of subaltern views of the world, whereas the limited dyad of altruism/selfishness belongs to the worldview of those who already hold most of the cards in the pack, and whose idea of evolutionist wit today is to see trade unions as a mutant species doomed to extinction for their lack of global fitness in the postmodern market economies. For Dawkins, however, there are only two apparently legitimate modes of action and motivation-altruism that appears to increase the welfare of others at the expense of the altruist, or selfish behavior that advances the welfare of the self. As it happens, the first option is a false one, since it "often turns out on closer inspection that acts of apparent altruism are really selfishness in dis- guise."'4 Try as we might to act toward others in the spirit of mutual interest, there does not seem to be any way of outfoxing our selfish genes. For, accord- ing to Dawkins's view of natural selection, altruism operates at the level of the gene alone, not the individual, family, group, race, nation, or species. Nothing could be more atomistic than this picture of social behavior, and yet socio- biologists consider it to be in a direct line of descent from Darwin's original assault on human arrogance. Despite Dawkins's admonition that, through "free will," we "at least have the chance to upset [the] designs" of our selfish genes--"something that no other species has ever aspired to"-it is difficult to imagine a theory that is less useful as a contribution to human decency or social change. Indeed it is a remarkably impoverished version of the theory of evolution that allows a single choice between altruism and selfishness to dom- inate the field of play. Why have I dwelled so long on this analogy with the Chicago gangster? Not to prove that better sociology could have produced a better analogy (it could, but that is not the point), nor yet to show that the analogy is already full of sociology (it is, but that does not get us any farther down the road). Rather, my purpose is to remind us that while there are other, less dismal, orders of social thought than the one that generated this particular metaphor with its par- ticular appeal, this should not be taken as an excuse to endorse a revised, reformed, or improved version of sociobiology. In other words, there is no point finally in saying that the Chicago gangster is not a good metaphor for the selfish gene: to do so one would first have to accept the hokey idea that genes can be selfish (the same applies to Crick and Orgel's concept of "junk DNA" that appears to carry no advantage in the "struggle" of natural selection). Alter- nately, one falls into a trap laid especially for utopians if one suggests compar- ing genetic traits with more favorable role models like the Chicago blues musi- cian, or the Chicago activist-preacher, or (a longer shot) the Chicago architect. Perhaps the only really sensible thing to do is to try to eschew this kind of attribution altogether, and look elsewhere, to local and culturally specific explanations, for the existence of selfish or altruistic behavior which, for all of the relentless attention afforded them by sociobiologists, account for a mere fraction of the range of human behavior, and which, when all is said and done,</page><page sequence="13">Andrew Ross 105 are culturally specific descriptions of behavior that do not apply so readily out- side of Western humanist societies. In addition, as Stephen Jay Gould has argued, one can accept the socio- biologists' principle of kin selection without accepting the notion of genetic control of behavior. In Gould's view, the more important and creative aspect of natural selection lies in the biological potential developed by organisms. In the case of mammals, that potential is usually held to lie in the growth of large brains which give humans the capacity to learn and choose from a whole range of behavior (and create dumb theories) without being instructed or pro- grammed in these choices by their genetic makeup.'5 Ultimately, then, we ought to be looking hard at the example of alternative social environments (other than, say, the battlefield or the marketplace) for Darwin's legacy. Of course, this does not guarantee that we will get rid of bad metaphors, but at least we ought to know where our metaphors are coming from and where they are going. The hope is that we can do this while avoiding both the fundamen- talism of the old school of empiricism and much of the rhetorical fetishism espoused by the newer schools of literary and linguistic theory. The upsurge of rhetoric as a problem of knowledge in the last twenty years does not have to be viewed as a simple symptom or cause of the crisis of materialism; if anything, it ought to be seen as a complex expansion of materialism. We should not have to be obliged, then, to choose between metaphor and materiality, at least not unless we have given up on the idea that our world entertains contradictions on a regular basis. On the other hand, the excesses of sociobiology stand as a clear warning to those who would simply gloss over the problems raised by the metaphorical treatment of matter. Other Darwins To alter the landscape chosen by sociobiologists as the natural habitat for self- ish genes, we must consider the significant distinctions in the cultural history of Darwin's legacy and, in particular, the bearing they have upon the current ecological crisis. It has often been acknowledged that Darwin's thought about evolution drew primarily upon two conflicting theories of natural life.16 On the one hand, there was Malthus's dismal picture of a natural economy defined and willed by God as an unequal ratio between population and perpetually scarce resources. What passed from Malthus into popular ideology was the given wisdom that life for most people was fated to be a miserable struggle for existence in a world where there simply isn't enough to go around. Conse- quently, the backdrop to Darwin's theory of natural selection was a ceaseless war of organic species in competition over limited resources like food and space. Violence, competition, conquest, and scarcity were destined, then, to govern the economic struggle over the occupation of nature's finite system of niches. On the other hand, Darwinism is also indebted to the more Romantic</page><page sequence="14">106 Chicago Gangster Theory of Life view that nature is imperfect and unfinished, creatively evolving as a realm where species can create new roles and niches for themselves at the expense of no other competing species. According to this view, the key to natural selec- tion lies in the creation of complexity, variation, and divergence in a world where codependence and diversity, rather than warfare and limitation, were the rule. Despite the tension between these two theories of nature, it is clear that competition and scarcity held sway as the dominant Darwinian principles, and that they have left their dismal mark on the subsequent path of the life sci- ences. The more optimistic path was reclaimed for social Darwinism by appro- priators like Herbert Spencer and other Anglo-American apologists for laissez- faire economics, who saw competition amid scarcity as a healthy, progressive environment for the social evolution of humans. Consequently, the hold exercised over biological thought by the doctrines, both dismal and optimistic, of Victorian laissez-faire economics has been quite tenacious. The law of competition and the condition of scarcity continue to play a role akin to that of default settings within the life sciences, while the identification of evolution with "progress" (for Darwin, nature had no tele- ology, apart from the better adaptation of species to their environments) has lent the organic process a highly moral coloring that Darwin himself was anxious to avoid. Nowhere does this seem more evident than in the development of ecological thought where scarcity is widely regarded as a rudimentary circum- stance of nature, whether among the resource-minded environmentalists, whose apocalyptic prognoses about "limits to growth" are pragmatically addressed to the managers of industry, or among deep biocentric nature activists, morally moved to conserve and redeem sacrosanct areas of wilder- ness land from human contamination. On the one hand, the appeal of the envi- ronmentalists is to an empiricist model of nature as a limited economy of resources: overuse of these resources threatens the survival of all species (and ecosystems) but primarily the human species. On the other hand, the biocen- trists view nature as a powerful, if fragile, moral economy which zoologically punishes the human species for its cosmic arrogance. In the first model, there is no account of power, while in the second model human domination of nature is simply turned upside down-domination is still dominant. Just as in socio- biology, both of these perspectives project particular social prejudices, whether empirical or moral, into ideas about the natural world. Nature only appears to be "limited" or "scarce" if it is conceived as a finite quantity of economic resources that can be renewed or exhausted. So too, nature only appears to be judgmental if it is endowed with a moral essence that defines human activity as rivalrous and transgressive. Both models are regulated by relatively fixed laws, to which we are asked to subordinate our actions and thoughts. Whether one believes in the existence of "laws of nature," or whether one believes, as I do, that laws only exist in human society, it should be clear (a) that both of these views of nature are full of social theory, and (b) that in so subordinating our-</page><page sequence="15">Andrew Ross 107 selves, we risk forfeiting any independent or alternative response to perhaps the most consequential debates of our times. To accept (a) and (b) is not to deny that there is an ecological crisis nor to suggest that our response to that crisis should ignore its empirical and its moral components, but rather to insist that the way we talk about this crisis and the way we imagine our place within the natural world will determine the often draconian social prescriptions advo- cated in the name of resolving the crisis. This is why, for example, I am more inclined to think of it as an emergency, which one addresses and from which something "emerges," as opposed to a crisis for which one merely finds a "solution," and which is more likely to be expediently exploited, if not created ex nihilo, by the powers that be. To the environmentalist and the biocentrist alike (who are accepted in pub- lic consciousness as if they were noncontradictory sides of the same green face) we may want to respond in Darwinian ways, not because Darwin holds the truth, but because the contradictions that troubled Darwinism are, in some part, vestigially responsible for these divergent schools of thought. To resource-minded environmentalists, we can preach the fundamental historical lesson of evolution-the continuity between humans and nature, and the absence of any unique properties or privileges that justify human domination over nature. To the atavist or deep ecologist, we can preach Darwin's other les- son-that evolution has no directed moral purpose, progressive or otherwise, and that the survival of organic species is more a matter of social intercourse than it is a result of physical laws, purposive or otherwise. One lesson there- fore asks us to acknowledge the similarity between nature and society, the other asks us to acknowledge the differences between nature and society. Those of us who distrust such neat symmetrical analyses, who object, in principle, to preaching, and who favor a more inclusive and dynamic picture of nature and society, will feel more comfortable with a properly social ecology, by which I mean a social theory of nature that presents itself as such, rather than masquerading as a zoological theory (sociobiology), an economic theory (environmentalism), or a moral theory (deep ecology). First and foremost, a social ecology is one that recognizes the similarity and the differences of humans from other species in the natural world. In this respect, we might qual- ify a few myths that continue to circulate in the lifeblood of popular environ- mentalist consciousness. It is simply not true, for example, that humans are unique in transforming their environment while other species simply adapt to theirs. All organisms enjoy an alloplastic, rather than a simply autoplastic, rela- tion to their environments. Whether they are bacteria working host or neigh- boring cells, plants changing the composition of the soil where they grow, or birds and beavers building nests and dams, all organisms are a cause as well as an effect of their environments, with which they and their genes are indisso- ciable. Humans alone, however, have the intellectual and technological ca- pacity to radically reshape environments in self-consciously purposive ways,</page><page sequence="16">108 Chicago Gangster Theory of Life and that is their difference from, say, "social insects." Nor is it true that pre- humanist, or non-EuroAmerican societies uniquely enjoy a harmonious, non- destructive relation with their environments, many of which they exhausted through deforestation and overuse, or with other species, many of which they hunted to extinction. There is no doubt, however, that the scale of destruction has become nigh catastrophic in modern societies, where special dispensation to devastate the natural world arose out of a combination of the ideologies of humanism and rationalism with the intensive development of industrialism. Similar myths circulate around the topic of scarcity. Human cultures are not governed by any "natural laws" of overpopulation and scarcity if only because humans alone have the capacity to create societies where such "laws" are not the primary determinants of survival. Presently, since everywhere in the world scarcity is artificially induced in the interest of maintaining power hierarchies, all such "laws" are used as instruments of social oppression and are only spu- riously related to actual conditions of physical limitation. Indeed, I would argue that it is virtually impossible for us to conceive of conditions of scarcity that would be purely physical in constitution, unaffected, that is, by social decisions about the distribution and consumption of resources. Economically speaking, "scarcity" figures as a measure of limitation only with respect to capitalist systems of growth and development, and only inasmuch as the cal- culus of such systems does not incorporate ecological costs except as "exter- nalities." The key to resolving the ecological crisis does not lie in the ratios of some zoological/economic calculus that will impose mathematical limits on population and consumption levels any more than it lies in the golden codes of natural morality that will prohibit human intervention while delegating supreme authority to Mother Nature. Above all else, it lies in the radical reor- ganization of social life on the planet. An ecological code of ethics that does not incorporate that lesson will not be evolutionary at all. Most people tend to accept that "limits," whether they are socially imposed or socially chosen, are a necessary feature of any ecologically minded reorga- nization of social life, and indeed that limitation is the cardinal principle of ecological thinking. It is assumed that in the West, above all, economists, industrialists, and politicians will have to be persuaded to limit growth, while citizens will have to be weaned off the exponential scale of increasing con- sumer gratifications that underpins the custom of steady economic growth. There are reasons to be uncomfortable with the widespread popular deference to this criterion of limitation, especially when it is advanced as a criterion of regulation in social and cultural life. In the first place, we should be wary of any discourse of limits that equates an "excess" of rights and freedoms with the excesses of growth and development generally held responsible for the ecological crisis. Material scarcity has long been employed as a justification for imposing punitive measures and structures of inequality upon populations. In the global context today, it is increasingly cited as a basis for exacting dras-</page><page sequence="17">Andrew Ross 109 tic policies upon developing nations, whereby dire population measures are "introduced"-starvation, disease, forced sterilization-that are seen to be consonant with the sustainability, for some, of a Western way of life. Many of the classical liberties and rights that are a constitutional part of Western modernity today were won on the back of an expansionist liberal economy. Our liberal political institutions were achieved in tandem with the growth of imperialism: classical liberal theory assumed an abundance in nature that perhaps could have been realized only by plundering the rest of the world's resources. It does not follow, however, that these institutions, liberties, and rights are directly tied to the fortunes of an economic system based on unlimited growth. Indeed, it is precisely because of the existence of public freedoms that limits on growth can be democratically chosen and agreed upon. And yet, not only are these principles considered to be a premature luxury in developing countries, they are also threatened with limitation wherever they exist in the developed world, by the manipulation of material scarcity, the invocation of national security, the strategy of economic recessionism (an eco- nomic strategy, yes, and not an economic consequence). In times of socially induced crisis, even the most "universal" rights and liberties are subject to more than the usual level of limitation. In recent decades, we have seen the partial achievement of nonuniversalist rights-those pertaining to women, and racial and sexual minorities-that were tied in part to the economic surplus of the long postwar boom, and consequently to the creation of new consumer identities for the bearers of such rights. In the current recessionary mood, where consent for a step-up in regulation can be more directly elicited, the call to limit these rights coexists with the call to tighten our belts. The dominant metaphor here is one of paying for the excesses of the past. For conservatives, the excesses are the libertarian permissions of the sixties and seventies, while for liberals, they are related to the yuppie greed of the eighties. In either case, the call for frugality, austerity, and rollback sounds across the whole spectrum of civil society. Ecology, raised to the middle ground of political life in recent years, has provided some backing for this call, because it offers an argument about "natu- ral limits," seemingly based upon empirical projections, that can be used to support a campaign based on the discourse of limits. In the social realm, this campaign has taken the primary form of a conservative backlash against women's and minority's rights, but it has been echoed by neoliberals' move to exclude "special interests," and also by the left's complaint about the "frag- mentation" of old class-based alliances resulting from the growth of the new social movements. In the cultural realm, the campaign has taken the form of a holy war against sex-positive expression in art and popular culture, the moral injunction to "just say no" to certain forms of cultural experience and experi- mentation, and the redrawing of social norms around the nebulous quotient of "family values." In the latter realm especially, the green ideology of the natural</page><page sequence="18">110 Chicago Gangster Theory of Life body in a natural environment can very easily translate into drastic prescrip- tions about social behavior, especially when it employs the terms of traditional values, common to conservative and green alike. While it may be necessary to rebut the call for limits-sounding across a whole spectrum from the economics of corporate environmentalism to the cul- tural politics of traditional values-it would be ahistorical to suggest that cul- tural freedoms can be uncoupled from the social conditions in which they were won and are maintained today. On the one hand, popular ideology tenaciously insists that people are less free when they have less to consume even though many consumers recognize that higher levels of consumption involve them in socially constraining networks of dependency and debt that are not always vis- ible or economically quantifiable. But it is nothing more than First World privi- lege to suggest that people in nonconsumer societies are somehow more free in their less commodified ways, or more healthy in their freedom from diseases associated with life in high consumer societies. On the other hand, the inven- tion of new forms of cultural expression often finds its most fertile soil in the pockets of permissibility created as a marginal offshoot of a free market econ- omy. Countercultures, alternative cultures, and underground cultures feed off this kind of surplus. Such forms of expression in an "open" democratic society are as vital to the dynamics of social change as those created out of resistance to more oppressive circumstances in a "closed" nondemocratic society. Neither enjoys the luxury of conditions of its own making. Not only may it be impos- sible, it may also be undesirable to abstract cultural freedoms and political rights, even natural rights deemed inalienable, from the social milieu in which they are exercised. The larger problem, however, may lie with our conceptual understanding of "limits" themselves. Limits, whenever they are invoked, call to mind either a mechanical system with a restricted capacity for production or distribution, or some finite quantity of material resources. Neither of these is an adequate rep- resentation of the dynamic qualities of an organic ecosystem. More binding yet is the suggestion of encountering limits or confines on a linear path, along which route we are then obliged to withdraw. This conceptual model, in particular, helps to support atavistic calls for a return to preindustrial infrastructures, or else punitive calls to scale back along the road of consumerist gratification and/or civil rights. The linear model of advance and retreat (there is nowhere else to go) is an equally inadequate way of representing the life of civil rights movements, which diversify their "gains" almost immediately, each step for- ward being a step sideways (what Viktor Shklovsky called "knight's move") into an alternate world where new and often unforeseen relations of power come into play, and where what had been seen as "advances" at the previous stage now take on a different and less straightforward appearance. The sexual revolution is a case in point, where the sexuality of bodies has undergone a radical change in social meaning in the age of AIDS. So, too, fighting the bat-</page><page sequence="19">Andrew Ross 111 tie over reproductive rights in the political landscape of the 1980s and 1990s means something different from the struggles that brought forth legal protec- tion of abortion in the 1970s. The clock is never turned back. Above all, the discourse of limits is best eschewed wherever it implies that our lives and actions are to be reckoned according to some irrefutable calculus or moral cipher of nature. The kind of action needed to address the ecological crisis is not best served by coercive messages about restraint in the face of immutable outcomes. People respond better to calls for social fulfillment than to a summons to physical deprivation, and that is why an ecology movement that uses self-denial as a vehicle for inducing change is as pathetic as one that uses apocalyptic threats or appeals to Mother Nature's vengeance. An ecologi- cally sustainable society lies in a future that has developed a more democratic way of ordering its priorities; it does not lie in a mythical past to be recreated by simply scaling back current levels of production and consumption. For a critique so focused on the natural world, it may seem ironic that I should be advocating an ecology that looks first and foremost to the task of social reorganization and cultural innovation for its cardinal principles. It has been part of my argument here, however, that nature does not always know best, nor does it always harbor the best solutions. Technologies, for example, that are based upon natural elements, or that imitate natural processes are no guarantee of health or sustainability or even biodiversity. Substances extracted from the Brazilian rain forest can be used to make the most toxic chemical compounds; in fact, many of the most toxic chemicals are naturally occurring elements, not industrial products. Principles of animal physiology are habitu- ally used to construct weapons of destruction; the dreaded heat-seeking mis- sile, for example, was modeled upon the heat-sensitive snout of the rattlesnake. Biomorphic houses designed according to the principles of botanical architec- ture-the growth rate of bamboo shoots, the structure of a rose-are just as likely to be instruments of social apartheid as housing modeled on industrial factories.17 Recombinant genes-the results of technologies considered natu- ral, nontoxic, and environmentally friendly by past industrial standards-are capable of introducing catastrophic strains into the open environment. At this point in the debates about ecological politics it seems more and more crucial to have arguments against conceiving nature as a model of behav- ior, let alone a moral authority, magistrate, or lord high executioner. Judg- ments, models, and arguments taken from nature are usually always derived from society. This is something that does not go without saying. The idea, cur- rent today, that nature's way is going to free us is a cruel inversion of the idea that liberation from nature is what frees us-the idea that got us into this mess. Notes 1.
