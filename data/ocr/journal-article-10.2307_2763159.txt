<plain_text><page sequence="1">Religious Chastity. An Ethnological Study. By ELSIE CLEWS PARSONS. New York: privately published under the nom- de-plume of John Main, 1913. Pp. xii+365; Appendix, Bibliography, Index. The spirit in which this work is evidently undertaken is explained by the statement, "similarities in culture point, not to the existence of set cultural stages through which all societies must pass, but to the homogeneity of human mind and its tendency to express itself, given like circumstances, in like ways." The author has taken considerable pains to get together a great mass of material from diverse primary sources which deals with human belief and practice centering around supposed relations of the living with the recently dead. From the comparison of different customs and ceremonies she educes additional evidence to substantiate the modern ethnological principle above enun- ciated. Fear of the recently dead leads primitive man to the invention of various schemes to trick or frighten away the importunate ghost. The widow, being especially liable to death infection, must be scrupulously disinfected by show of bereavement. The "haunted" widow has to undergo cleanings, else remarriage will be dangerous for her and her man. The exaggerated observance of mourning customs is usually incumbent upon the widow. Where ghost fear yields to ghost love, care for the comfort of the dead is paramount in funeral and mourning customs. The widow is the one who has special responsibility to cater to his daily need of food and drink, to be the custodian of his corpse or</page><page sequence="2">694 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY bones. When women have begun to figure primarily as chattels, they must be buried with the dead as are his other belongings. Under these circumstances wives may be clubbed to death with great ceremony, buried alive, or set adrift bound to a boat. When there is a change in ideas about destroying property in general at death, the widow's fate is milder. Now she becomes the widow of service rather than of immola- tion. Widow chastity and service were more widespread customs than widow immolation, for the latter is a luxury of the great. Chastity has a sort of magical potency and medicine-women often observe chastity. Anthropomorphic gods need female service, and special classes of women are god-devoted: old widows, and again "vowed virgins." It appears that the amorously adventuresome deities of mythology are sun-gods, and since sun-gods are gods of fertility, the god's powers of reproduction are multiplied on earth by the representation of them by mortals. Hence the fertility cults believe that the human bride of the god husband imparts his potencies to her community. Thus concepts of sympathetic magic appear to explain the wife-priestess and the priestess-wife. But this divine type of sexual hospitality was uncertain because it interfered with domesticity. When the phallic character of the god is insignificant and the woman's promiscuity is no longer thought of as a means of magical communication between him and his worshiper, chastity is required of god-given women; this is strongly emphasized when the proprietary rights in women are strict. Unchastity becomes a grievous offense. To preserve the purity of god-dedicated women there is an ever-increasing tendency to seclude her. She may become a nun. Although the drift toward chastity for magic or worship is in early culture periods held in check by the powerful tendency to give excep- tional privileges to the medicine-man and the king-god, experience showed that chastity became an entertainable and tolerable idea for other than religious ends. The work abounds in a great variety of ethnological illustration which serves to show the primitive mind's undeveloped powers of differentiating separate modes of human activity as well as to exemplify its subordination to the principle of association of ideas. The reader is often conscious of repetition and is impelled to wish that more care had been taken in classifying the material after some definite generaliza- tion in order that light might be thrown upon its truth or falsity. There is a common fault in much modern ethnological writing of avoiding generalizations of any sort. The inevitable consequence of this is seen</page><page sequence="3">RIEVIEWS 695 in absence of purpose and loss of coherence. The work would have been given greater clarity and definiteness if the relation of the material presented to the principle of association of ideas or to the principle enunciated in the preface had been more consistently pointed out. The tone of the work is judicial. A most complete bibliography is appended. F. STUART CHAPIN SMITH COLLEGE NORTHAMWPTON, MASSACHUSETTS</page></plain_text>
