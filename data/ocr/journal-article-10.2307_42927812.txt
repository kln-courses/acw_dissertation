Reviewed by robert dunnell, University of Washington Aspects of Prehistory presents the substance of three lectures delivered by Grahame Clark in 1969 at the University of California at Berkeley. Treating major themes in world prehistory, the lectures are derived from the author's reflections upon the writing of World Prehistory: A New Outline and its predecessor of similar title. Most readers will find the substance of the</page><page sequence="2">2o8 Book Reviews book familiar, at least implicitly. The real value lies in the fact that Clark has drawn all the bits and pieces together into a comprehensible whole. Tying together the three lectures, each repre- sented by a chapter, is a single overriding thesis : man, in all his uniqueness, is part of the natural world and a product of natural processes, and thus prehistory is to be understood in those terms, as part of the evolution of the natural world and not profitably in a self-contained anthropomorphic fashion. The first chapter, "The Relevance of World Prehistory," ostensibly treats the expansion of history to the preliterate past and beyond the confines of the Western tradition. This expansion is both a part of the increasingly comprehensive commonality among men and a means of under- standing, in perspective, the diversity still present. "Expressed in a sentence, the signi- ficance of world prehistory is the contribution it is able to make to widening the perspectives of history in accord with the needs of today" (p. 40). But this is a superficial conclusion, for Clark succeeds most admirably in establishing the identity of past and present; the present is simply the current face of prehistory. The establishment of this identity is a stepping- stone to the development of the main thesis in the second chapter, "Material Progress." Here technology, subsistence, and distribution of early man are shown as shaped by natural selection operating increasingly upon man's cultural rather than biological characteristics. Clark recognizes six "modes" of tool construc- tion that are broadly applicable to pre-civilized development: Mode 1, pebble tools; Mode 2, bifacial tools; Mode 3, prepared-core flake tools; Mode 4, blade tools; Mode 5, microliths and composite tools; and Mode 6, ground stone tools. His arguments relating these "modes" to his main thesis are qualified and judicious. His treatment of near-civilized and civilized men is less structured, more simplified, and lacks depth. In the final chapter, "The Dawn of Self- Awareness," he attends the appearance of peculiarly human attributes such as speech, religion, art, and an awareness of the world beyond immediate contact. Much of this chapter is devoted to emphasizing man's distinctiveness in these aspects, but the point of the chapter is quite the opposite. Clark argues succinctly that even these dramatically human characteristics are amenable to an evolutionary overview, that self-awareness too is an adaptive advantage favored by natural selection. Without contending the main thesis of Aspects of Prehistory , which is well taken, there are a number of important objections that might be raised, especially in connection with the substantively oriented second chapter. The most persistent, and at least to this reader most damaging, difficulty is the failure to distinguish the development of new forms, the process stressed by Clark, from their diffusion in developed form. Surely the conditions under which new forms arise are far more restricted than those under which the new form, once developed, can spread. His suggestion, for example, that ethnographic peoples who "... combine the sowing of crops with the migratory habit ..." (p. 90) are evidence of a gradual transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture and that sedentary settlement is not a precondition of agricultural subsistence belies this failure only too clearly. He does not consider the possibility that this particular combination may not be the product of develop- ment but rather of diffusion, or whether the peoples representing this combination are viable or becoming extinct. Numerous examples of similar oversimplification can be found in the treatment of peoples engaged in a productive kind of subsistence. Clark does not recognize that one of the products of the evolutionary process he describes is a new mechanism for change, one without analogue in the biological realm, which may well be the single most advantageous characteristic of man in the adaptive sense Clark considers. Early in pre- history, when diffusion plays a less important role, the effects of this failure are negligible, but it badly weakens the arguments as they pertain to civilized peoples. Another disappointing feature is the failure to consider the effects of absolute population increase, changing population density, and changing rates of effective communication in treating the rapidly increasing rate of cultural change. Perhaps there has been a change in the rate of innovation within the human species, but surely a large part of this increase can be linked to population size and its consequences rather than to the ability of men to innovate. Aspects of Prehistory is a humanistic argument for a science of man. The main thesis cannot be challenged. Natural selection and evolution are powerful tools for understanding prehistory, but in the demonstration of this point a lot is sacrificed, especially the evolution of nonbiolo- gical and nontraditional mechanisms for cultural change. This kind of oversimplification, the only</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 209 real flaw in the book, is perhaps unavoidable, but its effects are pervasive. It is difficult to say to what audience the book is directed, but I doubt that anyone, whatever his specialized interests, will read the book and not gain considerably in perspective.</page></plain_text>
