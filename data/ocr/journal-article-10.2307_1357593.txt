<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews Die Sammiung zyprischer Antiken im Kunsthis- torischen Museum/The Collection of Cypriote Antiquities in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, by Alfred Bernhard-Walcher, Guinther Dembski, Kurt Gschwantler, and Vassos Karageorghis, edited by Wilfried Seipel. Sammlungskataloge des Kunsthistorischen Museums, Band 2. Vienna: Kunsthistorisches Museum Wien, 1999. 238 pp., 5 black-and-white drawings, 2 color drawings, 137 color photographs, 1 map, 2 tables. Cloth. $74.50. This lavishly illustrated catalog, with full-page color photographs and text in English and German, introduces the collection of the Kunsthistorisches Museum, consist- ing of what the authors regard as the largest and most important collection of Cypriot antiquities in Central Eu- rope. This comprehensive collection includes some 700 objects that should be of great interest to art historians and archaeologists who work in Cyprus, the Aegean, and the Near East. Among the items represented are vases; limestone, marble, and terracotta sculptures; terracotta statuettes; a Ptolemaic dedicatory inscription; an unusual voluted capital; models; and coins spanning the entire Bronze Age to the time of the Roman Empire. Each item is thoroughly but succinctly described; com- paranda are provided when they exist, and probable con- text is supplied when available. A number of objects are of particular historical significance. One example is the early Iron Age askos (no. 32) in the form of a ship that calls to mind the turmoil at the end of the Bronze Age. Another group of historically important objects is found in the section on Cypriot coinage, which remains an under- studied field in ancient numismatics. The introductory essays for the various sections give a brief overview of the general characteristics of each category of object and discuss their probable functions based on similar objects with known provenience. The quality of these essays, however, is uneven. The discus- sion of the function of and various stylistic influences on Cypro-Archaic sculpture is especially detailed and infor- mative, yet dispassionate. For example, Oriental, Greek, and Cypriot features such as ear cap jewelry on female sculptures are clearly distinguished. In other instances, the essays and descriptions rein- force anachronistic ideas or art historical assumptions that seem out of place in modem archaeological literature. An anthropomorphic jug of a female holding a child that dou- bles as a spout (no. 42) is deemed not "entirely success- ful," but nevertheless "interesting and amusing." This and other impressionistic aesthetic judgments found in the text neglect the social meaning and significance of the artifact. Furthermore, they neglect more nuanced approaches to material culture such as found in gender studies (e.g., Bolger 1996; Knapp and Meskell 1997). Aegean elements in the early Iron Age pottery are associated with a Greek- speaking element in the population in contrast to more re- cent and refined studies of ethnicity (e.g., Hall 1995; Jones 1997). Cypriote kings fighting in alliance with a Greek army during the Ionian revolt against the Persians (5th century B.C.E.) are regarded as the "awakening of national feeling" (p. 132), although Greece itself was no more than a collection of city-states that were at odds more often than not. A more interesting approach might have been to ask why certain items such as horse-and-rider figurines were common to both areas and to address the significance of these patterns. Some of these questions are more solidly addressed in the end notes where the dual function of horse-and-rider figurines as tomb and sanctuary offerings is detailed (p. 232). A couple of awkward usages occur, which should have been noted by the editor. For example, a conical rhyton (no. 23) is referred to as a funnel, the term "temple boy" is used early on (no. 75) but only defined in a later entry (no. 90), and the Cypro-syllabic script is referred to as the syllabic alphabet (p. 212), a seeming contradiction. The acquisition of the collection mainly began in the early 19th century, with sources for it including a virtual who's who of east Mediterranean archaeologists. The col- lection's history is one of the most fascinating parts of the book and is important for framing Cypriote archaeology within its colonialist past. Not only did portions derive from the collections of Cesnola, Ohnefalsch-Richter, Georg v. Millosicz, and from the Pierides collection in Larnaca, but Sir Arthur Evans also donated 25 votive stat- ues from the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. These vari- ous historical strands of the Vienna collection serve to extend the history of activities of these various collectors. They also shed light on how ancient art was viewed in the 19th century, namely, with Cypriote art viewed as a devel- opmental link between Greece and Phoenicia (p. 39). Such historiographic treatments are missing from many intro- ductory texts. Furthermore, the discussion of collecting forms a leitmotif throughout the text. Another unspoken theme lurking beneath the surface is that of the archaeol- ogist as amateur collector versus the archaeologist as sci- entific professional. Although the bilingual text gives this book a super- ficial appearance of accessibility, various anachronisms reveal contradictions regarding the role of catalogs in con- temporary archaeological and art historical discourse. The preface characterizes the catalog as an introduction to Cypriote art that includes only a "selection" of what are 97</page><page sequence="2">98 BOOK REVIEWS BASOR 323 deemed the "most important examples" that are "intended to impart an impression of beauty" (p. 9). Yet, if one of the purposes of a catalog is to document a body of data for further analysis, such selectivity lacks the comprehensive- ness required in modern scholarship. Introductions might be more usefully found in the genre of textbooks. What the reader is left with is an aesthetically attractive art book that might tastefully adorn a coffee table. This superfici- ality is reinforced by the depiction of some objects more than once as frontispieces or to preface the introductory text. Surely, the representation of some objects twice oc- curs at the expense of showing other objects left in storage and presenting additional documentation of some of the more complex sculptures in the book. Rather than a great culture in its own right, Cyprus is still regarded in this volume as a place geographically lo- cated "between the great cultures of the ancient world" which was "stimulated in many ways from the exterior," with "diverse influences, coming repeatedly in waves" (pp. 9, 37). These ideas of external stimulation and waves of influence imply a static culture requiring outsiders to bring progress and civilization to the natives. Such ideas are products of the same colonialist discourses and insti- tutions that accelerated the practice of collecting in the first place. The conscious appropriation of cultural traits by knowledgeable actors or agents might be another way to view external influence, rather than a passive "assimi- lation" of the innovations of others (p. 37). We are left with the question of whether at least certain sections of this book are introducing Cypriote culture or reinforcing unfortunate stereotypes about Cypriote civilization. A more important consequence of Cyprus's geographic loca- tion is noted by Karageorghis. He rightly draws attention to the resulting failure of Cypriote archaeology and art to find a niche in the curriculum of many universities, a sit- uation that is now changing as a result of the collapse of artificial boundaries between the Aegean and the Near East (pp. 23, 25). In his essay on the history of the Vienna collection, Bernhard-Walcher astutely notes that the archaeological activities of diplomats in 19th-century Cyprus resembled a competition. Although competition still stimulates the ac- tivities of modem archaeologists, the current goal is often prestige in the form of finding and excavating the most impressive site or being awarded a large or influential grant. It would be desirable to see future prestige vested in competition to produce the most thorough site reports, better means of preserving and conserving monuments for future scholarship, and in eliciting meaning from the study of contextual relationships. This last is perhaps the most important as it is the documentation of context that sepa- rates the professional archaeologist from the collector. One is left to hope that powerful institutions such as the A. G. Leventis Foundation which funded this particular work might more usefully turn their influence and prestige toward funding the conservation of one-of-a-kind archi- tectural monuments that are suffering from exposure and the comprehensive documentation of archaeological exca- vations. In this way, the east Mediterranean archaeology of the 21st century might result in an appreciation borne of understanding rather than of acquisition. Louise A.
