<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE KING OF THE CATS (ML 6070B) The Revenge and the Non-Revenge Redactions in Ireland EOGHAN RUA O NEILL I The migratory legend The King of the Cats - of which the two redactions found in Ireland form the topic of this paper - is usually classified as a subtype of the so-called Pan Legend. This has its name from a story told by the Greek writer Plutarch (c.50 - 120 A.D.) in chapter 15 of his dialogue De defectu oraculorum.' A summary of Plutarch's story goes as follows: Once when a ship was drifting near the island of Paxi a mysterious voice was heard calling out loudly from the islands for Thamus, an Egyptian pilot. He did not answer until the third time he was called. The caller then raised his voice and said: 'When you come opposite to Palodes, announce that Great Pan is dead.' Thamus conveyed the message when he came there, and before he had finished speaking, a great wailing mingled with cries of amazement was heard. The context of Plutarch's story is worthy of note. It was triggered by the topic of whether or not spirits are mortal, and it is presented as told by a certain writer named Philib, who apparently was a real person, an aquaintance of Plutarch's. Philib mentioned that he heard the story from a 1 The original Greek text can be consulted e.g. in the Loeb edition of Plutarch's Moralia (Plutarch 1936, 400, 402). In that edition one also finds the dialogue in English translation, entitled Obsolescence of Oracles (where our passage is found on p. 401 and 403). Another easily available translation, called The Decline of Oracles, is included in Plutarch's Moral Essays in Penguin Classics (Plutarch 1971; see for our story p. 53-4). 167</page><page sequence="2">168 EOGHAN RUA O NEILL man called Epitherses, the father of the orator Aemilianus, a man who was known to several others among those taking part in the discussion. Since Philib refers to Epitherses, who was his teacher in literature, as intelligent and reliable, we may assume that he believed the story to be true, and we are also informed that this view was shared by others who had heard it, including Emperor Tiberius himself. The story thus exhibits a number of the characteristics usually ascribed to migratory legends about the supernatural: it is anchored in everyday life, it is set in the recent past, it tells of something that could not in reality have happened - a human being's encounter with otherworld forces - but which is believed to be true and is vouched for by someone who is considered trustworthy, known to and often in some other way connected with the teller. The most characteristic ingredient of the story is a message of a tragedy in the spirit world, communicated from one supernatural being to another (or others) through a human intermediary. This description may also serve as a minimal definition of other stories found in latter-day folk tradition, which scholars are wont to bring together under the umbrella title the Pan Legend. II Due to its classical associations, the Pan legend attracted much attention in the 19th and early 20th centuries among philologists and mythologists.2 The first scholar to attempt a more thorough folkloristic analysis of the legend was Archer Taylor in a work entitled Northern Parallels to the Death of Pan (1922).? Taylor noted that the variants of the story current in folk tradition fall into two main categories: the 2 See e.g. Clemen 1922, Mannhardt 1875, 90-3 and 1877, 132 if., Gerhard 1915a &amp; b and Gerhard 1916, Frazer 1911, 120-34. These and many other early works are referred to and discussed in Taylor 1922, 4-11 and Boberg 1934, 8-9 179-80. 3 The very first to observe the similarities between latter-day tradition (in Germany) and Plutarch's Pan story seems to have been Felix Liebrecht in his introduction to his selection from Gervase of Tilbury's Otia lmperialia (Liebrecht 1856, 179-80).</page><page sequence="3">THE KING OF THE CATS 169 anthropomorphic group, in which dwarfs, elves or other supernatural beings in human shape are featured, and the zoomorphic group in which both the sender and the receiver of the death message are cats.4 Taylor's study was followed, and to a great extent superseded, by Inger M. Boberg's monograph Sagnet om den store Pans D0d (1934). Inger Boberg retained Taylor's main division in referring to the anthropomorphic group as vettegruppen (The Goblin Group') and to the zoomorphic group as kattegruppen ('The Cat Group') but - on the basis of the distribution and frequency of the respective groups, as she saw them - Boberg carried the analysis further, maintaining that the goblin group is mainly Germanic, the cat group mainly Celtic. The goblin group, which dominates in Scandinavia - and which is frequently found in Germany and also occurs in Holland, Belgium and France - is stated to be absent from the British Isles. The only exceptions to this are Shetland (where it is found in a number of variants containing phrases in Norn, the old Scandinavian language there, thus betraying their West Nordic origin) and Guernsey (in a form closely resembling that found in Normandy and Brittany). The cat group, on the other hand is said to to reign alone in England, Scotland and Ireland and it is also the only group represented in Icelandic tradition. Furthermore it is attested in certain parts of north-western continental Europe: in France (where it is slightly more common than the goblin group) and in Denmark, Holland and Germany (in which countries the goblin group dominates).5 As to Plutarch's story, Boberg considers it to be an isolated importation from northern European Germanic tradition, where the goblin group is postulated to have existed long before 100 A.D.6 The cat group Boberg regards as a Celtic development, though she is undecided as to whether it took shape on the continent or developed on the British Isles. A redaction within the cat group containing the motif that the killed cat revenged (a redaction we will return to below) is considered by Boberg to be a most definitely Celtic form.6 4 Taylor 1922, 24. 5 Boberg 1934, 11-2, 155-6, 159. 6 Boberg 1934, 142-50, 155-7.</page><page sequence="4">170 EOGHAN RUA 6 N19ILL C.W.von Sydow, who inspired Inger Boberg's work, enthusiastically accepted her division of the Pan Legend into a Celtic and a Germanic form and adapted the theory to fit in with his favourite notion of age-old regional variation. He termed the goblin group a 'Teutonic oicotype' and the cat group a 'Celtic oicotype'.7 Further contributions to the study of the legend were made by Johan Kahlen - who drew attention to neglected material from western Sweden;8 Norwegian forms of the Pan Legend can now be found in Christiansen's legend catalogue under ML 6070A, Fairies send a message and ML 6070B, The King of the Cats. Elsewhere Christiansen also noted a number of American variants, which seem to be derived mainly from English tradition.9 Complementary to Taylor's and Boberg's studies is a paper by Martti Haavio, 'Der Tod des Grossen Pan' - in which new Finnish material is introduced.'0 Haavio stressed that there are certain amalgamations of the goblin group and the cat group, e.g. in variants where the receiver of the death message is said to be a troll who has taken the shape of a cat. According to Haavio the anthropomorphic shape is older than the cat-shape, so that the development was Kobold &gt; katzenahnlicher Kobold &gt; Katze ('goblin &gt; cat-like goblin &gt; cat')," in which event the 'Celtic' group has to be regarded as constituting an innovation. Waldemar Liungman, in Sveriges sagner (Liungman 1957 69, IV, 184-219), retains the term The Pan Legend and makes the same distinction between kattversionen ('The Cat Version'; his No. 809 A) and vatteversionen ('The Goblin Version'; his No. 809 B) as Boberg, though he stresses the fact that they can form hybrids and influence each other in areas where they co-exist. Otherwise his opinions as to the age and distribution of the legend and its forms differ radically from Boberg's. According to Liungman there is no 7 von Sydow 1948, 350-1; originally in von Sydow 1934, 53. 8 Kahlen 1936, 90-2. 9 Christiansen 1962b, 100-1. 10 Haavio 1938,128-30. 11 Haavio 1938, 124.</page><page sequence="5">THE KING OF THE CATS 171 need to suppose that either of the two groups go further back than the fifteenth century A.D. and the cat group, he thinks, might have reached England and Ireland as late as the middle of the sixteenth century. Liungman also finds it likely that the legends, as we now have them, ultimately have some connection with oriental laments on the death of gods or spirits (such as those also reflected in Plutarch's story); these, however, he attributes to contacts between Europe and the Orient in southern France, which need not be older than the last centuries of the Middle Ages. This, if correct, would mean that 'The Pan Legend' is a misnomer, that the connection between Plutarch's story and the legend as found in later folk tradition is only of an indirect nature."2 III As a result of all the above-mentioned investigations a considerable body of variants of The Pan Legend has been amassed. Taylor investigated close to 250 variants from England, Scotland, Canada, France, Germany, Denmark, Norway and Iceland. Boberg added in excess of 100 variants, including some from countries not represented in Taylor's study. Further additional material indicates that the cat group is found somewhat more frequently and over a wider area than Boberg thought. There are for instance a number of variants belonging to the cat group as far east as Finland and Estonia."3 Approaching the Pan Legend from an Irish angle, however, one cannot but be struck by the paucity and inferior quality of the material from Ireland upon which Boberg - and other scholars who in all essentials use the same variants - base their opinions of the age, origin and dissemination of the story. This is regrettable in view of the prominent role 12 Liungman 1957-69 IV, 184-219, 499-506. On the other hand Bengt af Klintberg 1972, 8 (cf. 132-4 - Nos. 118-121 - and commentary, 309-10) accepts Boberg's view that there is a more direct connection between Plutarch's story and the folk variants. 13 Haavio 1938, 129 and, for Estonia, same author, 119 with reference to Aarne 1918. See also Simonsuuri 1961, 107, sub G 120, Der Tod des Grossen Pan.</page><page sequence="6">172 EOGHAN RUA O NEILL ascribed to the 'Celtic' form of the story under discussion. In fact the entire corpus of Boberg's Irish material amounts to only 14 variants, some of which she has not had access to in their original language or even in their full forms, but rather quoted from translations and summaries.14 There would have been some excuse for this at the time Boberg penned her thesis, in the early 1930s, when very little Irish material was available; however, the situation has altered radically since, thanks to the intensive collecting carried out after the establishment of the Irish Folklore Commission in 1935. Whether or not one should attach any importance to Boberg's theories of the origin and distribution of the Pan Legend is certainly not a question that can be profitably discussed before this new material has been carefully sifted. It goes without saying that such an analysis might also provide clues to the solution of other problems, such as the form and function of the narrative complex in question both in Ireland and elsewhere. This, of course will necessitate renewed examination, not least of the Scottish and English material, a subject upon which I can here enter only marginally. What I aim to provide is merely a survey of the more salient forms and traits of The Pan Legend as found in Ireland and their distribution within the country as well as putting forward some ideas as to how these facts might be interpreted in the wider context as we now know it. This survey is to some extent based on two previous investigations of mine, a short paper in the journal Sinsear 1 and and unprinted third-year essay in the Department of Irish Folklore."6 The latter work contains a full list of the Irish variants - 243 in all - I have been able to assemble through a systematic search of the folklore manuscripts - chiefly the Main Manuscript collection and the Schools' Collection, now in the Department of Irish Folklore - printed sources and my own field collecting."7 14 Boberg 1934, 144, 147. 15 ? N?ill 1982-3. 16 ? N?ill 1982. 17 All these variants are listed in Appendix 2 in ? N?ill 1983.</page><page sequence="7">THE KING OF THE CATS 173 IV The first important result that emerges from my material is that the goblin group is not represented in Irish tradition. True enough, there are legends in Ireland in which supernatural anthropomorphic beings receive a message to the effect that their abode is afire and one of their children burnt or dead. This motif is met with in particular in a common story which has been entitled The Fairy Hill on Fire (MLSIT 6071)18 and in some Irish versions of the legend, which Reidar Th. Christiansen terms The Changeling and lists as ML 5085. However, these narratives do not conform to the definition of The Pan legend as given above: in them the piece of information is tendered by the main human actor (not by the supernatural being), it is delivered directly to the addressee (not through an intermediary), it is spoken inside a house (not originally heard in the open air) and, above all, it is a false message, intended to lure the supernatural being into leaving the house (not a true message the result of which comes as a surprise to the human who conveys it). Though this does not preclude the possibility of some kind of connection between legends about the 'real' message and those about the false message, I consider it preferable not to classify these narratives as variants of Christiansen's Fairies send a Message. Nor do they fall within the ambit of The Pan Legend as defined above. In any event The Fairy Hill on Fire as well as the variants of The Changeling which include the motif False Message about Fairies' House Being on Fire are dealt with elsewhere in this collection of folk legend studies"9 and need not concern us further here. 18 For an example, see below, 19 See ?ine O'Neill's and S?amas Mac Philib's articles in this volume.</page><page sequence="8">174 EOGHAN RUA O NEILL V It is thus established that all 243 Irish variants of the Pan Legend I have managed to bring together belong to the cat group. It is also noteworthy that nowhere in this corpus do we find any indication that we are dealing with fairies, witches or other supernatural beings who have taken a cat's shape; the cats in the Irish variants are certainly supernatural but, apart from that, they are nothing but cats. As regards distribution, my material is likely in all essentials to reflect the true state of affairs. The material is large enough to be representative and I have also endeavoured to bring together variants from as many different areas of the country as possible. This was facilitated through systematic use of the variants listed by 0 Suiilleabhain and Christiansen, under Type 113 A in The Types of the Irish Folktale,20 but many other variants have been taken into account. Some of these sources - especially the printed ones - can be difficult or impossible to localize, but information to hand shows that the legend was taken down in most Irish counties, and that it was - and perhaps still is - one of the more common narratives of its kind. In all likelihood the legend was until fairly recently well known in most parts of Ireland. The fact that no examples have been documented from a few counties to some extent reflects uneven collecting - due e.g. to the circumstance that children from the six counties of Northern Ireland did not take part in the Schools' Collection scheme and that full-time collectors through whose effort the major part of the Main Manuscripts' Collection was brought together - were not evenly distributed throughout the country. A further consideration is that collecting got under way so late in certain parts of the country, that many of the old rural traditions had died out. The legend seems to have been disseminated in Ireland almost entirely through oral channels. Only about a dozen of the variants collected in the field contain details which prove or render it likely that they ultimately derive from printed sources. 20 TIF 45-6. A number of the items listed there have been included in error. Corrections to TIF are given in Appendix 4 in ? N?ill 1983.</page><page sequence="9">THE KING OF THE CATS 175 VI The great majority of Irish variants of The King of the Cats are self-contained. Most prominent among the rare hybrid forms is a combination with a tale listed in TIF as 2412 C The Cat Asks for Boots. This combination is not referred to by Boberg from Ireland or elsewhere; neither have I myself come across any examples of it, or of TIF 2412 C in isolation, outside Ireland. The mechanics of the combination cannot be fully understood without a detailed investigation of Type 2412 C, a subject the discussion of which must needs await another occasion.2' VII As indicated above, Boberg noted that the variants within the cat group fall into two main forms or redactions. These she refers to as Den brittiske kattegruppe i simpel form ('The British cat group in simple form') and Den brittiske kattegruppe endende med havnedrab (The British cat group ending with revenge killing').22 I will henceforth refer to these simply as the Non-revenge Redaction and the Revenge Redaction. One example of each redaction from Ireland is given below in the Sampler of migratory legends.23 In order more fully to illustrate the salient features of the respective redactions a further example of each will be adduced here. The following legend, which was taken down in 1937 or 1938 by a schoolgirl, Ena Hanks, from a Mrs Brigid Behan, New Street, Rathangan, Co.Offaly, who is said to be 'an excellent hand at telling', belongs to the Non-revenge Redaction. Mrs Behan, who was 69 years of age at the time stated that she had heard the legend when she herself was a young girl from an old woman by the name of Ellen Reilly.24 21 Cf. however, ? N?ill 1983, 44-6 and Appendix 4, where an attempt has been made to single out versions of TIF 2414 C which have been listed in error under TIF 113 A 22 Boberg 1934, 142-50. 23 See below, 24 IFC S 778:101.</page><page sequence="10">176 EOGHAN RUA O N]1ILL One day a farmer was going from the mill with a load of corn, and just as he was passing the lime-kiln a cat jumped over the gate, and perched on one of the sacks. 'Tell Han Can that Katherine Anne is dead', he said to the farmer and immediately disappeared. That night the farmer was talking to his wife about the strange words of the cat. 'What did he say?' said his wife. '"Tell Han Can that Katherine Anne is dead," he answered. Their own cat was lying in the ashes, and when he heard the words 'Han Can' he jumped up and shook himself: 'Oh, dog and soul!' he exclaimed, and leaped over the half-door, and not until three days had elapsed did he return. It is believed that he was at the funeral of Katherine Anne. A fairly typical example of a tale belonging to the revenge redaction is offered by a story taken down c. 1958 by the reliable and well-known collector Seain 0 Dubhda from T6mas 0 Suiilleabhain, Minard, Co. Kerry. It is is given here in translation from the original Irish text.25 Bruidaire Cinn na Luaithe This is a story I heard from an old man from Cinnaird Jarthair. His name was Diarmuid 0 Gruiffn. The poor man is dead now many a year. There was a man from somewhere around there who was working in Dingle, and he often used to walk home, especially at weekends, late at night. This particular day he was working for a butcher, and he was quite late leaving Dingle and he had a small parcel with meat under his oxter. When he came to Lios na Daibhche a cat appeared next to him, miaowing and miaowing, and what did our man do but cut a small slice of the meat with a knife that he had and throw it to the cat. Then one cat after the other appeared and he went on throwing slices of meat to them and in the end the whole road was filled with cats. What did he do but give the one 25 Printed in B?ai. 31, 1963, 141-2; the manuscript is in IFC 1530:5-6.</page><page sequence="11">THE KING OF THE CATS 177 closest to him a blow of his stick, stretching him out dead. But before he died he spoke and said to the man: 'When you come home tell Brutdaire Cinn na Luaithe that you killed Adam of the Cats.' Then he threw all the meat he had to them, and they ripped it apart, but he went on as fast as he could until he reached home. When he came home an old singed cat covered in ashes was lying beside the fire. The man came to think about what the cat he had hit with his stick on the road had told him, so he spoke to him and said: 'Bruidaire Cinn na Luaithe, I killed Adam of the Cats.' Arah, before the man even knew it, the cat by the fire stood up and with one leap enmeshed itself in his throat, taking a grip that could not be loosened. The head was cut off the cat with a reaping-hook. But the man was already dead, the artery in his neck ripped. There were many who told that story, or a similar one. There is something about the cat. It is said that he contemplates killing a man three times every night, and would do it if it wasn't for fear of the dog. VIII As the examples show, both the Non-revenge and Revenge Redactions are divided into two episodes of about equal length. The first of these, which has an outdoor setting, I will refer to as the external episode and the second, which takes place inside a house - as a rule the home of the main (and sometimes only) human actor - will be termed the internal episode. In both redactions the main human actor - who is invariably a man - encounters cats who speak (usually one in each episode). The link between the external and the internal episodes is in both redactions a death-message, which is passed on from one cat to another via the main human actor. Many variants of both redactions share a number of further traits of a more concrete nature. Thus in the external episode the man is normally depicted as travelling at night in a forest, across a field, or along a solitary road, and the first cat he encounters is often said to come leaping out suddenly and</page><page sequence="12">178 EOGHANRUAON1tILL unexpectedly from the top of a fence. In the second episode the man is instead static, sitting at home by a blazing fire with his house cat beside him. In both redactions it is also often stated or indicated that the two cats are of a different kind: the outdoor cat is big, strong and vigorous, a wild cat or a cat which has run wild, while the house cat - when first seen at least - seems small, miserable and tame. It is obvious, then, that some of the most important structural elements in both redactions of The King of the Cats consist of binary oppositions: nature - culture, man - supernatural creature, domestication - wildness, darkness - light etc. Traces of still another common binary pair - male and female - is also found in both redactions, in that a female human listener, a person to whom the man relates his adventure - so that the house cat comes to hear of it - is introduced in many variants. As a rule she is said to be the man's own wife. It is not surprising that her sphere of activity (or shall we say inactivity) belongs to the domestic scene. As will be touched upon later, the opposition male - female also to some extent enters into the names and sexes of the cats involved. Side by side with these and other points of agreement, the two redactions contain their own specific motifs and traits which render them quite different in character and bestow their own special flavour upon them. The non-revenge variants are simpler and on average much shorter than the revenge variants. In none of the variants of the Non-revenge Redaction are we directly informed who the cat that delivers the death-message is, but there is no special reason to assume that it is identical with the cat whose death is announced. The actual message is - as is also often the case in the revenge variants - delivered in a rythmical core sentence, which however is frequently more memorable in the non-revenge variants, since it in many cases contains a short rhyme, the rhyming words being the name of the dead cat and that of the cat which is to receive the message. In some instances an even more striking effect is achieved through the outlandish and whimsical character of these names. In line with the meek and non-aggressive character of the cats which forms a striking contrast to their</page><page sequence="13">THE KING OF THE CATS 179 aggressiveness in the Revenge Redaction it is also noteworthy that a high percentage of both the cats reported to be dead and the indoor cats receiving the message seems to be female. In the internal episode of the non-revenge variants there is more variation than in the external, though the ending nearly always lacks the violent and gory elements. Usually there is a fine balance, parallelism and contrast between the external and the internal episode: the outdoor cat enters the scene with an unexpected jump, while the indoor cat leaves it in an equally sudden an unexpected way. The house cat is sometimes stated to have disappeared forever; this is the case when it is implied that the dead cat was a royal one, the king or queen of the cats (a trait that is found in a fair number of both non-revenge and revenge variants); sometimes, however, the indoor cat is said to have returned after a period of time. In the latter case we often hear that it attended the funeral of the dead cat, which in some variants is said to have been an aunt (or some other relative) of the house cat's. The balance between the external and the internal episode is even more artistic in the majority of the revenge variants. In them, in the external episode we usually hear of a fight between the outdoor cat and the man, resulting in the killing of the former, while in the internal episode the man is attacked and, as a rule killed, by the indoor cat. The cat from which the death-message emanates is also in the revenge variants invariably the cat which is killed in the external episode but manages to deliver the message about itself (though usually in the third person) with its last breath. The initial attack scene - in which sometimes the man, but more often the cat is the aggressor - provides scope for elaboration which increases suspense and allows a fuller depiction of the ferocity of the fight and the frightening, monstrous character of the wild cat. Some variants mention a whole band of aggressive cats, screaming out for meat. A variety of dramatic and gory details are also found in the description of the revenge action in the internal episode, such as the monstrous growth of the house cat and the ruthless way in which it goes for the man's windpipe. In a high percentage of</page><page sequence="14">180 EOGHAN RUA O N]tILL the variants it is stated or implied that both the outdoor and the indoor cats were male. The end of the story is in many variants that the house cat disappears after having killed the man and it may in such instances either be directly stated or assumed that it took up the kingship that had fallen vacant. Uncommonly, however, it is said that it was killed by by standers, who then have to cut off the cat's head or paws which are stuck in the man's windpipe with a knife, razor or some similar instrument. All in all, we may be entitled to say that in the Non revenge Redaction elements of innocent fantasy and childish tomfoolery are to the fore. It would not be far wrong to call it an entertainment legend. In its simplicity it also stands close to the humorous anecdote. That tellers of this form of the legend were amused by it themselves and that their audience did indeed respond with smiles and chuckles is something I had opportunity to observe myself, during field work in the Midlands, I was privileged to share with James G. Delaney in 1983. In the Revenge Redaction the narrative has ins&gt;tead, through the lengthening and introduction of additional motifs, moved in the direction of a folktale (and, as we have seen, it has indeed been classified as such in Antti Aarne's and Stith Thompson's catalogue, though wrongly so in my opinion). In its depiction of the supernatural, however, which is here more tangible and frightening than in the non revenge redaction, the story remains a narrative of the type generally termed belief legend. In its preference for excitement and danger, the Revenge Redaction may perhaps be said to reflect a more rumbustious and robust taste than the Non-revenge Redaction. Ix The existence in one and the same country of two redactions, which though similar in many ways are yet so different, gives rise to many knotty questions. In view of the traits outlined above, one might for instance ask whether the Non-revenge Redaction was more female orientated in that it was more often told by women - and</page><page sequence="15">THE KING OF THE CATS 181 perhaps also told more frequently to a female audience - than the Revenge Redaction which we might imagine to have appealed more to masculine taste. There are, in fact, some indications that this might have been the case. Tradition chains like that pertaining to the non-revenge variant quoted above, in which the teller was a woman who learnt her story from a woman, are not without parallels. On the other hand, the collected material shows an imbalance, in that so many of the collectors were men, who mainly collected from other men, and information about both the tradition chains and the telling situations is so scarce that it hardly suffices as a basis for forming firmer conclusions. However, since the legend is still told in some parts of Ireland we should perhaps not despair of being able to assemble new material which might bring these questions closer to their solutions. It would also be interesting to know whether various age groups are in any way correlated to the preference for and frequency of telling of the two redactions. One certainly gets the impression that the Non-revenge Redaction serves well the amusement of young children. Due to the fact that the non-revenge variants are so much simpler and uncomplicated than the revenge variants, one might also imagine that children would themselves more often attempt to tell the former than the latter. If this were so, it would hardly constitute a unique situation in relation to different redactions of folk legends. A similar pattern emerges e.g. from Patricia Lysaght's analysis of the two redactions of the legend The Banshee's Comb.26 It is not out of the question either that factors such as grown-ups deeming the non revenge variants to be suitable for children and children's actual liking for them may account for the high number of non-revenge variants in the Schools' Manuscripts. What I judge to be the main reason for this, however, will emerge below. The conclusion, consequently, is that caution must be exercised in the evaluation of possible correlations between age groups and the two redactions of the story. Here, too, the possibility should not be excluded that further field collecting might cast light on these matters. 26 Lysaght 1986, 154-81, cf. above, 67-82.</page><page sequence="16">182 EOGHAN RUA O NEILL Moving on from the matters pertaining to the sex and age of the tellers and their audience to those concerning geographical domicile, we find firmer ground under our feet. Though the number of non-revenge and revenge variants collected in Ireland is almost equal - the former amounting to 46% and the latter to 54% of my material.27 - they overlap only to a very limited extent. If we map all the variants we see that a fairly well-defined borderline between the two redactions can be drawn from Co. Donegal in the north to Co. Waterford in the south. East of this line we find the vast majority of the non-revenge variants, while west of it the Revenge Redaction (usually involving a violent attack scene also in the initial episode) is equally predominant. On closer scrutiny it also emerges that the eastern distribution area shows a rather scattered and disjointed pattern, while the western is heavily concentrated to a few counties: Donegal, Mayo, Galway, Kerry, Cork and Waterford, or - to be more specific - to parts of these counties where the Irish language is or, until recently, was spoken. From this - and the fact that the vast majority of the revenge variants are actually told in the Irish language - it is quite evident that there is a definite geographical and linguistic dichotomy within Ireland relating to the Non-revenge and Revenge Redactions of The King of Cats is Dead, the former being attached to the east and the English language, the latter to the west and the Irish language. x It is now possible for us to return to some of the views expressed by previous scholars concerning the distribution, dissemination, age and origin of the cat versions and The Pan Legend as a whole and investigate to what extent they can be confirmed or refuted, strengthened or weakened by our findings relating to the Irish material. Boberg's statement that the Non-revenge Redaction in Ireland is essentially confined to the south-east of the country 27 As revenge variants I have here considered all variants in which the man is attacked by the house cat in the internal episode.</page><page sequence="17">THE KING OF THE CATS 183 must be somewhat modified in view of the existence of a few additional variants rather far to the north and quite a number from the Midlands, which I have managed to unearth. The fact that the Irish non-revenge variants are now over 110 in number - as opposed to Boberg's 8 (out of which 3 are so fragmentary that it is even uncertain to which group they belong) - also proves beyond doubt that non-revenge variants in Ireland are far more common than Boberg thought. Nevertheless, I am in agreement with Boberg's statement that the real home of the Non-revenge Redaction within these islands is England. Many reasons in addition to the strong correlation between this redaction and the English language speak in favour of such a theory and also argue for the assumption that the redaction was brought over to Ireland in relatively recent times. The dissemination can hardly have begun earlier than after the Norman invasion, and variants are likely to have been introduced or re introduced during the 16th and 17th centuries as a result of plantations, which, as we know, in many instances occurred in the very places where non-revenge variants are most frequently found in Ireland. The fact that the cat names in the death-message in the non-revenge variants so often occur in rhymed pairs, such as Poll-Noll, Muggins-Juggins also indicates their English origin.28 This trait is completely absent in the Irish-language tradition - not surprisingly since full rhymes of this type are foreign to Irish poetic tradition as a whole. It may also be mentioned that some of the specific cat names used in the non-revenge variants - e.g. Peg and Moll - are common to some variants on both sides of the Irish sea. The situation pertaining to such names in England, namely that they - to use Inger Boberg's well-chosen simile - are like cog-wheels gripping each other, seems to apply also to Ireland. A more detailed investigation might even reveal the starting points in England and landing places in Ireland for some of the specific name pairs and names. Concerning the Revenge Redaction, Boberg maintains that it is the most typically 'Celtic' of the legends within the Pan 28 A list of cat names in Irish variants of The King of Cats is given in ? N?ill 1983, 71-7; cf. also the discussion there, 80-7.</page><page sequence="18">184 EOGHAN RUA 6 NEILL complex and that it was firmly rooted in Ireland and Scotland (the only places apart from Iceland where she knew of its existence). It might, perhaps, be wiser in view of the fact that no Welsh or Breton revenge variants have been brought to light to avoid such a wide term as 'Celtic', but it must certainly be agreed that the existence of over 130 additional Irish variants, the great majority in the Irish language, which I have brought together, gives massive support to the statement that the Revenge Redaction is firmly anchored in Gaelic Ireland.29 I have also information to the effect that there are more Scottish variants than the two Boberg adduced. This Irish- Scottish unity is in itself an indication that the Revenge Redaction is fairly old in Ireland and Scotland, and the distribution pattern in Ireland also makes it likely that the Revenge Redaction is older there than the Non-revenge Redaction. The occurrence of a number of sub redactions within the Revenge Redaction, basically corresponding to three major Irish dialect areas: Donegal and Mayo, Galway, and Kerry and Cork - distinguishable in particular on the basis of the cat names in them30 - offers yet another indication of some antiquity, though we have no means of determining with certainty how many centuries it would take for such variation to develop. A definite terminus ante quem for the revenge redaction in Ireland is, as Boberg as well as Liungman have noted, offered -by a variant included in a curious tract, entitled Beware the Cat, published in London in 1584.3' The story - which is triggered by a controversy as to whether birds and beasts have reason - is told as a true experience, stated by the teller himself 'and divers other credible men' to have happened 'about xxxii winters past'. The Irish provenance of this 29 The full-blown Revenge Redaction also stood a better chance to survive in Gaeltacht areas where storytelling lived on later than elsewhere and where tellers showed a marked preference for longer stories. 30 Cf. ? N?ill 1983, 84. 31 There is information to the effect that there were earlier editions; the first seems to have been printed in 1561. The work is attributed to a certain William Baldwin. An annotated edition of the passage relevant to our investigation is found in Malcolmsson 1868, 148-50. Cf. also Wood-Martin 1902, II, 124-5.</page><page sequence="19">THE KING OF THE CATS 185 variant is not in doubt, both since it is set in Co. Wexford and since it contains a phrase in Irish - shane foel,32 threateningly spoken by a monstrous wildcat with an unsatiable appetite which is finally killed but later revenged in the common fashion by a kitten who disposed of the killer by launching itself at his throat and strangling him. That this is far from the earliest Irish variant of the Revenge Redaction is not only likely in itself but also indicated by the fact that the story in question is somewhat corrupt, in that it lacks a full-blown message.33 What we have adduced so far may not be sufficient to refute Liungman's opinion that there is no need to suppose The King of the Cat is Dead in any of its forms - or any form of The Pan Legend on the whole - to be older than the fifteenth century. However I would at least consider our evidence to indicate greater antiquity. Of special importance in connection with the age of the Revenge Redaction is the manner in which one assesses the way in which this redaction was carried to Iceland, where - as mentioned earlier - no other form of the Pan Legend is found, but where there are in fact a number of revenge variants in addition to the only one known to Boberg and Liungman.3 In the event that we subscribe to Boberg's view that we are to consider the Icelandic tradition to be an offshoot of the Irish or Scottish one, that would in all likelihood also imply that the borrowing took place at the time Boberg suggests, around 900 A.D., when Iceland was settled, partly by people who had connection with Ireland and Scotland. A consequence of such an assumption would be that 32 Malcolmsson (1868, 190) remarks that '/eoi/ is "flesh", but the previous word is not recognizable'. Kennedy (1870, 149) thinks that the phrase - which he gives in the form Shone feol - should be interpreted as Is uaim feoil, flesh is from me, i.e. I want flesh'. It seems more likely to me that Shane is an attempt to render 'Se?in, that is to say Teasp?in, in the sense 'give', 'hand over to me'. 33 It is not mentioned in the external episode that a message was sent, but this can be inferred from the fact that the house cat mentions a particular cat name in the internal episode in the question 'hast thou killed Grimmalkin?' 34 See the list of variants supplied by Bo Almqvist, listed in Power 1985, 254, note 77.</page><page sequence="20">186 EOGHAN RUA 6 NILL the Revenge Redaction is likely to go back to at least the ninth century in Ireland or Scotland. One may suspect that it was in order to avoid such a possibility that Liungman maintained that the Icelandic tradition emanated from Zealand - contacts with Denmark in Iceland being most vivid after the Reformation. There seems to be nothing to substantiate Liungman's supposition, however, since neither he himself or, to my knowledge, anybody else has been able to point to Zealandic - or even Danish - revenge variants. On the other hand it has become clear since Boberg's study that she is wrong in her assumption that the revenge redaction outside Ireland and Scotland is found nowhere except Iceland.36 A few variants have now turned up in western Sweden and Norway. In view of this it is difficult to say whether or not we should regard all revenge variants as borrowings from Irish or Scottish tradition. The somewhat incoherent and confused nature of the Swedish and Norwegian revenge variants,36 as well as their general shortness and their paucity - traits one is often struck by in the periphery of the distribution area of a legend - might nevertheless make one inclined to subscribe to such a view. A variety of further - though not very firm - clues to the age of the different redactions in Ireland is offered by other circumstances. Some of the descriptions of the outdoor cat and of the changes in shape and character which the indoor cat - enraged by the death-message - undergoes, are stamped with such realism that one is tempted to suppose their ultimate background to be factual observation of the real wild cat (Felix sylvestris grampia), which is so much bigger and more robust than its domestic relative and when threatened and in a fighting mood arches its back and raises its fur, so that it seems to grow to twice its normal size, at the same time as it bares its sharp teeth, gives out a most frightful snarl and stares ferociously with its glaring eyes. Such cats - which 35 See Kahl?n 1936, 91, no. 11 (cf. Lindow 1978, 101) and the second of the Norwegian variants listed by Christiansen in ML. 36 Thus Christiansen's variant only contains the attack motif in the external episode, but not the revenge motif in the internal episode.</page><page sequence="21">THE KING OF THE CATS 187 even today are found in the Scottish Highlands - were perhaps common in Ireland at the time when the revenge redaction first appeared there.37 On the other hand neither of the redactions of The King of Cats is Dead could have originated - or had a chance to become popular - before domesticated cats were introduced. Unfortunately there seems to be uncertainty as to the chronology of the domestication of cats. Liungman, again in support of his argumentation for of a late date for The King of Cats, mentions that the earliest reference to tame cats in the British Isles (which is from Wales) dates from the tenth century,38 but this, of course, does not preclude their existence many centuries earlier. The wide spectrum of tales and beliefs attached to monster cats in early Irish literature, as well as in later Irish and Scottish folk tradition, may also be taken as an indicator that the idea that cats possess supernatural qualities and are simultaneously dangerous and murderous is an old and indigenous idea among the Gaels.39 It may perhaps not be overly fanciful, either, to relate the idea of a special ruler among the cats to Old Irish society in which kingship was such an important concept and in which tribal kings were so numerous.40 37 According to Joyce (1903 II, 460) wild cats were 'in old times very plentiful: large wicked rough-looking creatures, very strong and active and very dangerous'. And he adds that 'the race is not yet quite extinct, for wild cats, nearly twice the size of our domestic animals, are still found in some solitary places'. 38 Liungman 1957-69, IV, 503. 39 Cf e.g. Joyce 1903 II, 461; Much of the folklore about the unusual and curious behaviour of cats, their nocturnal habits and their ferocious nature is actually often incorporated in variants of our legend, e.g. such sayings as that the cat contemplates to kill a man three times every night, and would do it if it was not that they were afraid of the dog (see above, 177) For a selection of such cat lore see ? Cath?in 1982, 45-53, where some fine examples of The King of the Cat are also quoted and discussed. 40 Cf. Boberg 1934, 149-50.</page><page sequence="22">188 EOGHAN RUA 0 NAILL XI Some of the points I have touched upon above are in the nature of topics for further research that might eventually prove something, rather than constituting hard core facts or supplying definite indications of age or origin of the legend or its different redactions. I hope, however, that I have demonstrated that the Irish material is so rich, varied and important, that full account must be taken of it in all future treatments of The Pan Legend. Finally, by way of summary we may also say that a number of circumstances indicate that the revenge redaction is the older of the two redactions in Ireland and that it is the one that is most firmly rooted in native soil. Waldemar Liungman's contention that the cat version of the Pan Legend need be no older than the 15th century is in my opinion hardly tenable in view of many indications to the contrary. The Revenge Redaction is in all likelihood pre-Norman and probably pre-Viking. Nothing that amounts to firm proof of an even earlier date for the legend in Ireland has come to light, but neither has anything been adduced that makes impossible the assumption that the legend was told in Ireland just as early as Plutarch first reported it in another form, or even long before that.</page></plain_text>
