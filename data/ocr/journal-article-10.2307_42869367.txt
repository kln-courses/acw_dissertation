Taçon* RÉSUMÉ : Une analyse de l'art dorsétien en relation avec le stress culturel au cours de la préhistoire. Dans le passé, la plupart des études d'archéologie culturelle se sont concentrées sur les modes d'établissement, les besoins de subsistance et les innovations technologiques. Le domaine de la vie sociale et religieuse n'a guère été abordé, à cause, surtout, de la difficulté d'interpréter les restes matériels. Cependant, l'analyse des objets d'art constitue une façon d'enquêter sur ces aspects dé la culture préhistorique. Pour cette étude, nous avons examiné et photographié 865 pièces d'art dorsétien afín d'en interpréter le symbolisme. Les formes symboliques furent réparties en deux catégo- ries, les objets rituels (« chamaniques ») et les amulettes (« chamanistes »), et comparées aux formes similaires dans la littérature ethnographique. Des analyses morphologiques et contextuelles permirent d'établir que la plupart de l'art dorsétien fut produit dans la der- nière phase de la période Dorset. Cet article tente de démontrer que le stress écologique induit par des modifications dans l'environnement du Dorset tardif peut avoir entraîné un stress psychologique chez les individus dorsétiens, ce qui aurait amené une augmentation de l'activité rituelle, tant au niveau de l'individu que du groupe. La production et l'utilisation d'objets d'arts furent sans doute étroitement reliées à ces deux formes d'activité rituelle, auxquelles les individus durent recourir pour affronter les difficultés de leur situation. ABSTRACT: An analysis of Dorset Art in relation to prehistoric culture stress In the past most cultural studies in archaeology have focused on settlement patterns, subsistence requirements, and technological innovations. Adequate attention has not yet been given to the religious or social realms of prehistoric life, due primarily to the impene- trable nature of most material remains. One way that these aspects of prehistoric culture can be investigated is through the study of art objects. In this study, 865 pieces of prehistoric Dorset art were examined and photographed in an attempt to interpret the symbolism represented in these works. The forms were divid- ed into "shamanic" ritual and "shamanistic" amulet categories and compared to similar forms in the ethnographic literature. Various types of morphological and contextual anal- yses were undertaken and it was found that most Dorset art was produced in the Late Pe- riod of their culture. * Department of Anthropology, Trent University, Peterborough, Ont., Canada.

This in turn may have led to an increase in both group and individual ritual. Art object production and use were probably intimately involved with both and both forms of ritual may have helped individuals combat their situation more effectively. Introduction Dorset art has been recognized as being unique and distinct from other pre- historic Eskimo art forms for quite some time. It has received much attention in short, descriptive articles but few detailed investigative studies have been under- taken. Blodgett (1979), Collins (1967), Harp (1969/70, 1975), Mary-Rousselière (1970, 1971, 1979), McGhee (1974/75, 1976, 1980, 1981a), Meldgaard (1960a, 1967), Rowley (1940, 1971/72), Swinton (1972), Taylor (1965, 1969, 1971, 1971/ 72, 1972, 1975), and Taylor and Swinton (1967) have, for instance, concerned themselves more than others with the nature of prehistoric Dorset art but have stressed the fact that too little is known about it. Recently, however, a small num- ber of M. A. candidates have begun to explore Dorset art more intensively and systematically (see Windmiller 1974; Lyons 1982). These studies have given us a clearer picture of Dorset art style, function, and meaning. My own study conti- nues where they left off and explores new aspects of the Dorset art problem. One of the specific features of Dorset art that many investigators have noted is that most of it seems to have been produced in the final stages of their culture (i.e. after A.D. 800). J0rgen Meldgaard (1960a : 24), for instance, states that "most of the artistic products are from a comparatively late period about the year 1000, when the Dorset culture seems to have reached a peak of technical achieve- ment..." This idea has recently been corroborated by Robert McGhee. Not only has he noted that "Dorset art appears to have reached its peak" during the late phase (1978 : 73), but he also hypothesizes that contact with the Thüle may account for part of the increase in art production (1981 : 51). In Labrador, Callum Thomson has noted a similar trend. Intrigued by the large number of Late Dorset soapstone carvings he recovered from Shuldham Island-9 in Saglek Bay, he proposed that they were "part of a shaman's magical equipment, some having properties designed to deal with everyday matters of curing, divining, hunting magic and travel, others possessing features meant to cope with the new threat approaching from the north, or already upon them, the Thüle" (1982 : 9). The idea that culture-contact (with the Thüle) may have indirectly or directly influenced Dorset art production in the Late Period of Dorset existence is explor- ed in this study. More specifically, relationships between cultural stress and artistic productivity are examined in light of the environmental conditions faced by late Dorset culture. It is hypothesized that increased ecological stress (resulting from a 42/P. S. C. TAÇON</page><page sequence="3">warming trend in the climate that may have changed the availability of faunai re- sources [Barry, et al 1977; McGhee 1978 : 72-73, 1980 : 22] and also from contact with the Thüle and other migratory Dorset bands) may have led to increased psychological stress among some Dorset individuals. This, in turn, may have been countered by an increase in both group (shamanic) and individual (shamanistic) ritual. Both types of ritual were probably intimately involved with the production and propagation of specific art forms. Thus a late Dorset artistic florescence may be indicative of this pattern and process and may be discernible from the archae- ological record. In any investigation of the meaning and function of a society's art objects no one overriding explanation will account for all pieces of art produced. This is especially true when dealing with art objects produced over a time span of 2000 years and a geographical spread of over 2400 miles. Therefore several pos- sible uses of Dorset art are briefly explored and distinctions between art arising in one context versus another are exemplified. It is also argued, however, that some stimuli may account for more art objects than others and therefore particular trends and explanations for them can be outlined. Shamanism, for instance, may be a stronger impetus towards art production than boredom or the need for decoration and thus may account for much of the prehistoric art of North Amer- ica. Even here, however, distinctions have to be made as shamanic practices and ceremonies may lead to the production of some classes of art objects while more general shamanistic thoughts and beliefs may lead to the production of other clas- ses of art objects (such as amulets, expressions of myths and legends, and so on). Dorset Cultural Origins and Development The Dorset culture, as it is known archaeologically, flourished for a little over 2000 years. It is thought to have had its origins in Pre-Dorset peoples sometime around 1000-500 B.C. (McGhee 1982 : 8-9; Taylor 1959 : 41, 1962 : 61-64) and may have developed in the so-called "core area" of the Eastern Canadian Arctic (McGhee 1982 : 10). From this core area of Baffin Island, the Melville Peninsula, western Hudson Strait, and northern Hudson Bay the Dorset are thought to have spread into peripheral areas to the west, south, east, and north. By the first cen- tury A.D. Dorset culture was "well established throughout a wide geographic area; Ellesmere Island, North Greenland, West Greenland, Newfoundland, Labrador, Southern Hudson Bay and the Western Archipelago" (Kroker 1974 : 27). By the tenth century A.D. Dorset existence was being threatened by a change in climatic conditions and by Alaskan immigrators, the Thüle, who even- tually replaced the Dorset throughout the Arctic. Most Dorset bands are thought to have been driven away, killed off, or assimilated into Thüle groups (Bielawski 1979; Harp 1976 : 138; McGhee 1981 : 41-46; Taylor 1965 : 8). In many areas Dorset bands may have competed with the Thüle or with other displaced Dorset for food resources. In some cases, this may have led to starvation (McGhee 1978 : 73; 1981 : 46). By 1350 A.D. the demise of the Dorset was nearly complete, ANALYSIS OF DORSET ART/43</page><page sequence="4">although they may have persisted in some areas such as Diana Island off northern Québec until around A.D. 1500 (Plumet 1979) or in Labrador until A.D. 1560 or later (Thomson 1982 : 3-5). The Dorset are recognized by Taylor (1962 : 64) and others to be "physically Eskimo and linguistically Eskaleut". They may have been subject to some super- ficial Indian influences at various times but this most likely had a negligible effect on their cultural development. Dorset existence was essentially like that of Pre- Dorset peoples. "Like their predecessors, Dorset people lived in small seasonally- nomadic bands with little camps of skin tents in summer, sheltering in winter in small clusters of partly-underground pit houses. Some of these winter houses seem to have had skin roofs. Dorset man may have used, indeed might have invented, the snow-house" (Taylor 1965 : 7). The Dorset economic adaptation seems to have been quite consistent and broad-based over time (Bielawski 1979 : 103). They hunted seal, bearded seal, walrus, caribou, various species of bird, and other large fauna. Basically they lived off whatever was available with the exception of large whales; they were omnivor- ous and flexible. Within this flexibility, however, there may have been an over- dependence on some adaptations such as ice-edge fishing. This may have been especially true in Labrador as Cox and Spiess (1980) suggest. Dorset culture had many characteristic Eskimo traits but lacked others such as the dog and dog sled, a whaling subsistence and whaling technology, and the bow-drill. As well, they lacked such Thüle traits as the bow-and-arrow and the umiaq. The Dorset heated their dwellings with blubber-burning lamps often carv- ed from soapstone. They used antler, bone, ivory, and driftwood implements tipped with small stone blades. Chert, quartz, and quartzite were more commonly used by the Dorset and unlike their predecessors, they possessed ground and polished slate blades (Taylor 1965 : 7). Dorset Art Throughout the Dorset era hundreds of miniature works of art were produc- ed although art from the Early Period is rare. The art was made on an extremely small scale and is mainly sculptural in form. Rarely do pieces exceed 8 centimetres in length, yet some of the smallest pieces are complete with facial features and accurate portrayals of anatomy. The pieces were carved out of ivory, antler, bone, wood, tooth, soapstone, and on the rare occassion, chert or schist. It is highly possible and, indeed probable, that the Dorset also used highly perishable materials such as hide, fur, feathers, hair, and the like in the produc- tion of their art but objects in these materials have long since vanished. One indi- rect example of this comes from Button Point where Mary-Rousselière ( 1 970) has found a mask painted entirely in red ochre, except for the eyebrow and mousta- che areas. He speculates that bands of fur were held in place in these areas by small wooden pegs that can still be found in the mask (1970 : 20). 44/Pģ S. C. TAÇON</page><page sequence="5">Many other wooden figures of bears and humans recovered from Button Point also were painted in red ochre (some seals were stained black). Few ivory pieces indicate whether or not they were once painted, although a large ivory skeletal bear recovered from the 500 A.D. level of the Alarnerk site by Meldgaard has red ochre stains on its underside, in a hollowed out cavity. This cavity had a sliding cover and it is possible that it was filled with red ochre at one time, although Swinton (1967 : 43) suggests that cavities in bear figures accentuate the skeleton and therefore were always empty. He also speculates that "the red stains on some might then represent the divested blood". Red ochre has also been found in Dorset burials (Meldgaard 1955) and this may indicate that it had great religious significance. Subject matter in Dorset art includes human figures, heads and faces (often in multiples on the same piece), bears and bear heads, seals, walruses and walrus tusks, various species of bird with the falcon being favoured, caribou and caribou parts, model kayaks, miniature tools, and an assortment of other forms. As well, there are various containers, bone sucking tubes, sets of "shaman's false teeth" and other paraphernalia normally associated with shamanism. The vast majority of forms expressed, however, represent the principal fauna exploited for food, clothing, and artifactual material. Pictorial art, epic scenes, and examples of "story telling" are absent from the Dorset inventory, as are representations of house structures, vegetation, insects, and smaller species of fauna. Geometric decoration is minimal, usually being limited to a series of parallel or diagonal lines, crosses, Xs, and barbed or spurred incisions. Often these markings are found on the back or chest of an animal or human figure or at major points of articulation. Occa- sionally an utilitarian object is similarly adorned. Many archaeologists and art spe- cialists, such as Meldgaard (1960a), Taylor (1975), and Swinton (1967), have come to the conclusion that these markings are related to shamanic activity and they are commonly described as the "x-ray" motif. Absent from Dorset carvings is the circle-and-dot motif common to most Alaskan art forms and, indeed, any curvi- linear decoration whatsoever. Dorset art has been dated to all stages of Dorset culture and is thought to have its roots in a Pre-Dorset art tradition (Taylor 1969 : 40). Little is known of Pre- Dorset art as only a few examples have been recovered but it must have been fairly well developed as even some of the earliest Dorset pieces exhibit great craftman- ship and well developed form. It is also generally accepted that Dorset art has a magico-religious or shamanic basis (Blodgett 1978; McGhee 1976, 1980, 1981; Swinton 1967; Taylor 1967, 1969, 1975) although some pieces may have had more mundane functions. Previous Interpretations of Dorset Art A careful review of the literature reveals that there may have been many func- tions of prehistoric Dorset art. These may be summarized as follows: i) shamanism and its associated beliefs, practices, and ritualistic acts; ANALYSIS OF DORSET ART/45</page><page sequence="6">ii) sympathetic magic and the use of amulets; iii) fertility cults, "black magic", and burial rites; iv) decoration and marks of ownership; v) toys and gaming counters; vi) "art for arťs sake", amusement, and to pass time; vii) other. Of these various functions, the first three have received the most attentic while the effects of the others are regarded as minimal. Many of the above categi ries are not necessarily mutually exclusive but this breakdown allows one to foci on particular aspects of art and culture. Shamanism appears at the top of the li because it is the most frequent explanation appearing in the literature. It, alor with the other more plausible and influential functions will be explored by wí of the previous in-depth investigative studies of Dorset art. In 1967 William Taylor and George Swinton studied 125 pieces of Dorset ai These 125 pieces gave them 151 subject matter classifications (many specimei incorporate more than one subject) under nine broad subject categories. It w; their finding that 34% of the sample was human, 20% bear, 12.5% seal, 10.6 bird, 10% walrus, 4% caribou, 2% weasel and 6% unknown (1967 : 38; Tayl&lt; 1975 : 476-477). The objects were compared to art objects of other prehistor Eskimo cultures and ethnographic analogies were used to explain meaning an function. Taylor placed Dorset art in archaeological perspective while Swintc described it from an artist's point of view. Both noted a uniformity in style ov&lt; time and space (with the exception of Dorset art from Newfoundland) and boi concluded that it was "magico-religious" in nature. For Taylor, the functions &lt; Dorset art could be explained by shamanism, burial practice and sympathet magic (1967 : 44). Swinton, on the other hand, concluded that most, if not a Dorset art derives from shamanic ritual. He also stated that specialist artist-sh mans were probably responsible for the production of most of the art (1967 : 39) The study by Taylor and Swinton prompted Rie Windmiller (1974) to analy their conclusions statistically. He examined a 250 piece sample of Dorset art (mc of which was from the Igloolik area) in order to attempt to answer three ma questions: i) were there regional styles in Dorset art?; ii) was there an evolutic from realistic to abstract in Dorset art over time?; and iii) were carvings man factured and used predominantly by shamans? By answering these three que tions he felt he could "delimit the functions of art within Dorset societies" ai could "define how much difference in the manner of representation between s&lt; dements can be said to reflect differences in the societies that inhabited these se dements" (1974 : 64). After dividing the subject matter of the pieces studied into a number of cat gories and isolating incised motifs found on the objects, Windmiller compared « pieces using the statistical method of contingency tables and the chi-square mea ure of association. From the results he concluded that regional styles of Dorset a may be defined outside of the Newfoundland area; there is no general realistic abstract trend in animal carvings although some changes over time can be demo</page><page sequence="7">strated; and the majority of art objects appear not to have been used by artist- shamans but were instead used by many members of the community, probably in an amulet-like sense (1974 : 98). Windmiller's first two objectives were to address the problem of style in Dorset art. His results were, of course, preliminary but the problem was more fully resolved by Diane Lyons (1982) some eight years later. Lyons' study, although somewhat interpretative in nature, was designed primarily to see if regional and temporal styles in Dorset art did or did not exist. She examined 895 pices of Dorset art and broke them down into numerous attrib- utes, categories, themes, expressions, and motifs. Lyons also analyzed Dorset finds into five site-area samples and then compared the stylistic elements found among them. The site-areas Lyons chose to study are the Crozier Strait, Knud Peninsula, Igloolik, Button Point, and Port-aux-Choix and for this 585 art objects were compared. Lyons concluded that three well-defined regional styles of Dorset art existed during the Middle Period. This she based on a heterogeneous distribution of style elements between three site-area samples: Button Point, Port-aux-Choix and Igloolik. In the Late Period only one style was evident as there was a homogene- ous distribution of style elements between Igloolik, the Crozier Strait, and the Knud Peninsula. From her results, Lyons suggests that Middle Period conditions inhibited group interaction while Late Period conditions encouraged group inter- action and stylistic exchange (1982 : 142). Lyons offers several explanations as to why group interaction may have increased in the Late Period based on the envi- ronmental conditions of the time and relates this to Late Period art. She also sug- gests that there may have been an increase in shamanic activity in the Late Period. She bases much of this on McGhee's (1980) suggestion that shamanism increases in periods of crisis. "As the shaman's role is essentially that of maintaining the well-being of the community. Consequently, the widespread style of the Late Period as well as the increased volume of art of this period suggests that shaman- ism was important everywhere, and that the meaning of most shamanic motifs were understood by members in all groups who participated in Dorset culture" (Lyons 1982 : 146). Lyons surmises that a warming trend in the climate of the Late Period had a severe negative effect on Dorset sea mammal ice-edge hunting. As well, the invading Thüle may have competed with the Dorset and forced them into new areas. With the relocation of Dorset groups, interaction would have increased as would the diffusion of stylistic elements in art and technology (1982 : 147). Although there may have been many functions of Dorset art, most previous interpretative studies have concluded that it was used in shamanic ritual and was produced by specialist artist-shamans. Others argue that many pieces may also have been used in hunting magic in an amulet-like sense (for example Harp 1969/ 70). In other words, Dorset art is considered by some to be shamanic (of and per- taining to the shaman) in origin and is considered by others to be shamanistic (of and pertaining to the world-view of shamanism) in origin. It is my contention ANALYSIS OF DORSET ART/47</page><page sequence="8">that some forms of Dorset art are probably shamanic while others are probabl) more generally shamanistic and that they coexisted side by side. Results of analysis The Sample Although a little over 1 ,000 pieces of Dorset art have probably been discover- ed, the exact number of Dorset art objects in existing collections is not known. In the course of this study access to many pieces was not possible but in the end 865 pieces were examined. The sample should, however, be fairly representative of Dorset art in general as it was drawn from all areas of previous Dorset habi- tation. In total, 688 actual objects were examined and photographed while the re- maining 177 were studied through published photographs. Dorset remains with representational human and animal figures or with geometric designs were con- sidered "Dorset art objects" for the purposes of this study although it should be acknowledged, as McGhee (1976) and others point out, that forms of stone tools may be regarded as art. In this study primarily functional utilitarian objects were included only if the) possessed some form of elaboration (x-ray motif, cross-hatching, a human face ...) and therefore possessed more obviously symbolic character than more strictl) utilitarian forms. In total 52 (6% of the total sample) decorated tools were studied and 34 of these were decorated harpoon heads. The others included lamp rims, lance heads, whittling knives, handles, and engraving tools along with a few unique pieces such as a bird-head stopper or a comb adorned with a human face. Subject Matter The sample was divided into 35 sub-groupings on the basis of common sub- ject matter and was initially charted in terms of total numbers and percentages. As can be seen in Table 1, some pieces possessed more than one subject and therefore a total of 920 is obtained rather than 865. Only 6% of the pieces portray- ed more than one subject but 1 3 of these consisted of composite beings which were often half-man, half-animal in nature. Humans and bears were the most popular subjects portrayed by the Dorset, humans accounting for 18.73% of the sample (162 pieces) and bears comprising 1 7. 1 1 % ( 148 pieces). Sixty-six of the anthropomorphic beings were full-figured in form but human heads and faces were also popular (53 objects adorned with a human head or face, 14 multiple-face objects, and one miniature skull). Masks and maskettes were also produced by the Dorset. Maskettes (18) have been found all across the Arctic while masks or mask parts (8) have only been recovered from Button Point. All masks were made of wood and often were painted with red ochre. 48/P. S. C.

Bear heads are often found on the end of spatula objects, model kayaks, and wooden sticks. In Newfoundland small abstract bear heads of bone and ivory vastly outnumber other types of bear representation and Harp (1969/70) regards them as amulets. Sixty-two bear figures were examined and they range from extremely natur- alistic to highly abstract. Some of the most naturalistic forms are incised with the x-ray motif while others are completely undecorated. The most abstract forms seem to have had most of their "flesh" carved away and are often referred to as "skeletal bears". They usually have very hollow chest cavities and appear to re- semble an articulated skeleton with a complete head attached. Seals and birds were also quite prominent among the art forms; seals account- ing for 12.95% of the sample (112 pieces) and birds comprising 6.13% of the total (53 specimens). Walruses, spatula-like objects (which Collins [1950] and Meldgaard [1960a, 1960b] hypothesize to be abstract bears), container fragments, and decorated harpoon heads are the next most common subjects, each compris- ANALYSIS OF DORSET ART/49</page><page sequence="10">ing 3.5% to 5.5% of the sample. Other popular themes are model kayaks (27 - most from Button Point), miniature lamps and pots (17 - most from Shuldham Island-9), and caribou (18). As Table 1 illustrates, many other forms were also sculptured in fewer numbers. In total, human and animal forms comprise 62.52% of the sample or almost two-thirds. A further 27.40% of the sample is made up of what I have labelled shamanic equipment. These pieces resemble objects that were used by shamans of related cultures and have been interpreted by others as being shamanic. They include decorated container fragments (45) (often tubular in nature and usually perforated with numerous gouged holes), elliptical container tops and bottoms (19), spatula objects (46), model kayaks (usually adorned with the x-ray motif), and miniature harpoon heads (possibly used in curing rituals whereby they would be "sucked" from a patienťs body [McGhee 1980 : 22]). As well, I have included miniature lamps and pots (Thomson [1982] feels they may have been soul recept- acles or protectors), false teeth (similar to those used by North American Eskimo and Indian shamans to illustrate the transformation of man into animal or the possession of the shaman by a spirit), drum rims, miniature hourglass, goggle- like forms, and hollow cylinders presumed to be sucking tubes (highly decorated and resembling Northwest Coast pieces in appearance). Many of the animal and human figures may also have been shamanic magical paraphernalia but most were more likely amulets used by a variety of individuals. It is virtually impossible to separate out specific shamanic versus general amulet animal forms but to a certain extent it is easier with human representations. Maskettes, "killed" human figures (with holes in their chests and often with slivers of wood protruding from them), multiple-face carvings, masks, and representa- tions of "bird-men" (stick-like human figures with feathered limbs), on the basis of comparisons with ethnographic accounts, seem more likely to have been used by shamans rather than the general Dorset populace. These pieces account for 34.57% of the human images produced by the Dorset or 6.47% of all Dorset art objects. The rest of the human pieces (figures and solitary heads or faces) were probably carved and used by both shaman and non-shaman alike and they cannot be pidgeon-holed into one of the two categories. Above all materials, the Dorset seem to have preferred ivory (almost 50% of the total) perhaps because of its hardness and durability. Wood was also used frequently (20.35% of the sample) although most wooden objects come from But- ton Point. Bone, soapstone, and antler objects each comprise roughly 10% of the art forms studied although most soapstone pieces were found at Shuldham Island-9 in Labrador. Tooth, ramah chert, fine grain chert, schist, and limestone were used as well but to a much lesser extent. In total, 480 objects or 55.49% were equiped with a gouged hole for suspension or attachment. Just over 30% of the sample was found to be incised with the x-ray motif. It was by far the most frequent form of decoration used by the Dorset although a few pieces have cross-hatching, stars, sun-burst designs or various linear patterns and many are simply unadorned. Button Point is a unique site in that the x-ray motif 50/P. S. C. TAÇON</page><page sequence="11">was used to decorate carvings twice as often as the norm for the overall Dorset sample (61.97% was decorated with this motif). Taylor (1967, 1975) has conclud- ed that many Button Point pieces may have been created specifically by shaman- artists for use in shamanic ritual or burial rites. This he bases on ethnographic accounts of skeletonization in shamanic ritual such as those of the arctic explorer Rasmussen. Rasmussen reports that the Igloolik Eskimo shaman, through thought alone, could "divest his body of its flesh and blood, so that nothing remains but his bones" (1929 : 114). He also noted that an Igloolik shaman must be able to do this, to see himself as a skeleton, and then must name every bone of his body in a secret shaman's language. In this way, and only in this way, will a shaman be successful in his quest for help from the supernatural. Since Rasmussen, Eliade (1974), Fürst (1973/74), Hoffman (1897), Lommel (1967), Meldgaard (1960a), Swinton (1967), and others have remarked on the relation- ship between skeletonization, the x-ray motif and shamanic ritual. They suggest that the x-ray motifs is indicative of shamanic activity and for some such as Swinton (1967 : 41), among the Dorset, it is an indication that art objects were made and used by shamans. The motif, however, most likely has broader appli- cations and may be indicative of the spiritual realm in general. Certainly all modern native artists that use it in their work are not shamans and many of their works do not portray shamanic transcendence per se. Therefore the motif may have both general and specific meanings associated with it and may be considered as a power attribute that enhances the sacredness of an object. The Distribution of Dorset Art Over Time Dorset culture has been most often divided into Early, Middle, and Late Periods along both chronological (carbon 14) and stylistic lines. The Early Period is generally agreed to begin sometime around 800 B.C. and end around the birth of Christ. The Middle Period is more difficult to define and there seems to be no agreed upon time period in which it can be placed. Most archaeologists, however, see it ending sometime around A.D. 500-700. The most extensive Middle Period art site is Port-aux-Choix 2 in Newfoundland although many other sites also date to this era. Stylistically, however, there are few Middle Period sites and knowl- edge of the period is slight. In my scheme I have placed the end of the Middle Period at around A.D. 800. At this time most Dorset sites are stylistically "late" and changes that radically affected Dorset culture begin just afterwards (i.e. a warming of climate and the immigration of the Thüle). As well, since the Dorset seem to have survived in isolated pockets until the late 1500's (Diana Island, Shuldham Island), this scheme allows for three 800 year periods. As can be seen in Table 2, the majority of sites at which art objects were found were dated to the Late Period (excluding the unknowns). In fact, late Dorset art sites outnumber middle Dorset art sites by a factor of 2 and early Dorset art sites by a factor of 3. The difference is even greater when one looks at artifact numbers and percentages (Table 3). Roughly 60% of Dorset art objects seem to belong to ANALYSIS OF DORSET ART/51</page><page sequence="12">Table 2 The Age of Dorset Art Sites Period # % Early (800 B.C.- 0 B.C.) 10 12.66 Middle (A.D. 0 - A.D. 800) 16 20.25 Late (A.D. 800- A.D. 1600) 33 41.77 Unknown 20 25.32 Total 79 100.00 Table 3 The Age of Dorset Art Objects Period # % Early 42 4.86 Middle 158 18.27 Middle-Late 99 11.44 Late 512 59.19 Unknown 54 6.24 Total 865 100.00 the Late Period (this would increase to over 70% if Igloolik was included) while only about 20% belong to the Middle Period and 5% to the Early Period. This increase in the late period is quite profound and earlier suppositions about such an increase seem to have been verified. Reasons for it will be discussed after a look at some of the other results of the analysis. The Distribution of Subject Matter Over Time The main subject categories were compared over time in order to see if signi- ficant increases could be detected in certain periods. In Table 4 human, bear, seal, and bird subjects are compared excluding objects from the nebulous Middle-Late Period of Igloolik. This allowed a statistical comparison of the four subjects and a X2 of 43.20 with 6 degrees of freedom was obtained. This is significant at the 0.01 confidence level. It was found that bear and seal subjects, although increasingly popular over time, did not differ radically from the general pattern of increased production in later periods. On the other hand, there was a significant increase in human and bird representations in the Late Period. Of the 134 human images assigned to definite periods, 88.8 1 % were produced in the Late Period while 85. 1 0% of the 47 dated bird images were carved at this time. This compares with 56.49% of the bears and 60.00% of the seals. This significant increase may be quite important because it represents a change in focus or attention in art production and may be related to other changes in Dorset culture at this time.

Geographic Distribution In terms of geographic location, the Eastern Arctic core area produced the most art objects or at least the most have been recovered from this region. In total, 53. 16% of the sites from which art has been recovered lie within the core area and they have yielded a similar figure of individual art objects (53.06%). The High Arctic, north of the 74th parallel, was the next most prolific area; 17.72% of the sites and 22.66% of the artifacts were found in this region. Roughly 65% of the High Arctic art sites date to the Late Period. The Context in which Dorset Art has been recovered In many areas archaeologists have been able to distinguish between ritual objects used at the personal, household-sodality, or community-region level by focusing on the context in which objects were recovered. Kent Flannery (1976) had a great deal of success with such an analysis with material from the valley of Oaxaca, Mexico, while Windmiller (1974) and McGhee (1974/75) had somewhat less success with Dorset material from Igloolik and Dundas Island respectively. Although McGhee's study was more limited and focused, both McGhee and Windmiller came to similar conclusions. Both researchers state that their data indicates that the carving of art objects was not confined to specialized shaman- artists as Taylor and Swinton (1967) suggest. This they base on the distribution of animal figures and other "amulets" between houses, middens, and burials. It is also surmised (in McGhee's case) by a wide variation of workmanship. McGhee did, however, find that some ritual activity may have been confined to certain locations or was practiced by certain individuals (1974/75 : 144) based on the distribution of ritual items presumed to be shamanic equipment. This differs from Windmiller in that he found "no specific associations between any one con- text and one or a series of particular types of artifact" (1974 : 97-98). ANALYSIS OF DORSET ART/53</page><page sequence="14">The material Windmiller examined was from early, middle, and late Dorset sites while all of McGhee's was late. This study focuses primarily on late material although some middle art objects are also analysed, both with the late pieces and on their own. Specific subject matter and broad categories were compared in terms of their distribution between houses and middens. Because of the small number of burial art objects that have been recovered and since they were already analyzed by Windmiller, a burial context was excluded from the analysis. A total of 136 objects were compared and the results tend to support Wind- miller's findings of no specific association between any type of art object and a spe- cific context. This seems to indicate that most art objects were not left behind in specific locations or used by specific individuals. On the contrary, the results tend to support the idea that Dorset art may have been used by the Dorset populace in general and not only by select members of the community. Discussion of results There could be many reasons why most Dorset art seems to have been prod- uced in the Late Period. First of all, there could have been a substantial population increase at this time; thus we would find more sites and more art objects. Or, secondly, since the later pieces have not been in the ground as long as their earlier counterparts, there is more chance of recovery. Thirdly, there could be an archae- ological bias in that more Late Dorset sites may have been excavated than Early or Middle sites. In the same vein, it is possible that excavation has been concentrated in regions of high artistic productivity rather than in areas that yield minimal quantities. Lastly, there could, indeed, have been an increase in artistic activity among the Dorset at this time and this may be related to changes in shamanic and/ or shamanistic activity as a result of changes in the late Dorset environment. Looking at the archaeological evidence from the Arctic, we can most likely dismiss the first three explanations for the recovery of a large sample of late Dor- set art although they may have contributed to the observed trend somewhat. Mc- Ghee (1976 : 206), for instance, has estimated on the basis of size and number of prehistoric sites that the population density of the Dorset was fairly constant over the two millenia of their existence. More specifically, McGhee notes that although the Dorset culture expanded its area of occupation during the same time that Dorset artistic production began to increase, "economic adaptation and settle- ment pattern appear to have remained relatively constant and indistinguishable from those of previous centuries". Bielawski (1979 : 103) argues similarly and Maxwell (1980 : 506) suggests that along the southeast coast of Baffin Island "at any point in time" the Dorset population "was between 100 and 200 persons". As to the argument of differential preservation over time, the nature of the arctic environment seems to limit such a possibility. McGhee (1976 : 203) has found that "the material culture recovered from many prehistoric Eskimo sites compares favourably, in terms of preservation and range of items, with collections made by ethnographers from historic Eskimo groups". The main reason for this 54/P. S. C. TAÇON</page><page sequence="15">is that most prehistoric arctic refuse is permanently frozen and thus art objects (and many other artifacts made of organic material) do not disintegrate at the rate that they would elsewhere. Of course, this does vary from region to region and from site to site (i.e. more southerly located sites in Newfoundland or southern Hudson Bay, for example, would be more susceptible to increased decomposition over time) but, in general, the more northern sites decompose at a very slow rate. The validity of this fact allowed McGhee (1976) to undertake a study on differ- ential artistic productivity among Eskimo cultures involving a time span of over 4000 years. In terms of archaeological bias, this may have been a factor in the past but to- day as more of the Arctic is being explored, it is quickly being eliminated. Sites of all periods are actively being sought and examined and, if anything, there is more of an emphasis on the location of sites from the Early and Middle Periods as these eras are still improperly understood. It is also unlikely that archaeologists have concentrated in regions of high artistic activity as Dorset sites have been excavated in virtually all parts of the Arctic. New sites in remoter areas such as Ellesmere Island or Bathurst Island are continuing to yield new art objects and in some cases these sites are more prolific than less remote sites excavated at an earlier date. Because the effects of disintegration over time are minimized in the Arctic and since the possibility of an archaeological bias seems to be slight, many archae- ologists feel that studies of artistic productivity over time among Eskimo cultures is possible. McGhee (1976), as mentioned above, undertook a study involving a time span of over 4000 years. In McGhee's study the conclusion was reached that no single factor could account for productivity increases. Many variables such as fixity of settlement, amount of leisure time, and surplus economic production were examined as contributing factors. Each had a role to play in increased pro- duction but none were found to be causative factors and McGhee concluded that art production "might be expected to change in an apparently random pattern over a period of a few generations". In terms of the late Dorset, none of the above mentioned factors seem to account for their increase in art production nor does the evidence suggest it was random. It is hypothesized here instead that late Dorset art may have been an expression of or a reaction to both environmental and cultural stresses and pres- sures on late Dorset culture. More specifically, it was most likely a reaction to the stress of culture contact, competition, and possible elimination by other Dorset groups and incoming Thüle. As well, it may have been a reaction to the stress of starvation brought about by a warming trend in the climate at this time (see Barry, et al 1977). This warming trend may have limited ice-edge fishing, one of the major economic adaptations of the Dorset in many areas such as Labrador (Cox and Spiess 1980 : 659) and probably shifted game populations. McGhee (1981 : 51) has suggested that, at least at the late Dorset/early Thüle site of Brooman Point where a great amount of artistic activity took place, art forms may have been produced by shamans or for shamanistic activity in order to fight off Thüle newcomers spiritually. This seems to be in agreement with the ANALYSIS OF DORSET ART/55</page><page sequence="16">evidence from other late Dorset sites where many human and animal figures were found to have slots in the chest, throat, and back areas. These figures may have been ritually "killed" and may represent the remains of shamanistic activity. One could conclude that shamanistic activity must have increased tremendously at this time in order to cope with the stresses of culture contact and economic deprava- tion. This also follows from the arguments of Swinton (1967) as he feels that Dorset art was used largely by shamans and represents the remains of their acti- vities. Windmiller (1974, 1976: 217), after completing a depositional study of Dorset art objects (as described above) does not believe this. I am inclined to agree with Windmiller on this point, as I feel the art had a wider, more general use and my contextual analysis supports this. I believe that it was not carved solely by spe- cialist artist-shamans and was instead more general and personal. The carvings were probably made by many members of the community just as harpoon heads probably were. The same amount of skill and exactitude at carving would have been required of both. Esther Pasztory (1982) has argued in a similar vein with regard to both sha- manism and art in general. She makes a distinction between shamanism in the specific sense "in which an individual shaman mediates between man and the supernatural by entering a mystic trance" (1982 : 27) and shamanism in the gen- eral sense where various shamanistic beliefs may be held or practiced by a society. She finds shamanism in the specific sense characteristic of small hunting and gathering societies and responsible for only a small part of a society's art produc- tion. She sees the visual arts as being secondary to shamanism and the temporal arts of music, song, and dance as being primary. She does, however, note that shamanistic imagery is often used metaphorically to emphasize social and eco- nomic roles. Thus we often find shamanistic themes expressed in a society's art work but they are being used in a more general sense rather than a specific one. They add an element of spiritualness to an art object and in so doing make it more important and useful in expressing given situations. Pasztory sums up this idea in the following: Since the concern of shamanism is with states of transition, with becoming rather than being, the forms of ritual objects are rarely important in themselves and little effort is expended to make them aesthetically pleasing or precise in meaning. Aesthetic values are more closely associated with the importance of social and economic states. When shamanistic imagery is used as a metaphor to mark the transition from one social or economic level to another, the art works are usually more elaborate in form, more precise in meaning, and more skillfully made (1982 : 28). Pasztory's ideas can be clarified further by making a distinction between "shamanic" and "shamanistic" art objects. As mentioned above, the term shamanic should only be used with objects that derive from or are of or pertaining to an act of a shaman (specific). On the other hand, the term shamanistic should be used to describe those objects that pertain to or derive from the cosmology or world-view of shamanism (general). In the past these two terms have been used interchange- 56/P. S. C. TAÇON</page><page sequence="17">ably and this has led to an overextension of the term "shamanic" and a confusion of the meaning behind many examples of prehistoric North American art. This is particularly true of literature on the Dorset. It is my contention, based on the ethnographic literature and the results of my analysis, that a lot of Dorset art is more properly defined as shamanistic (and was not used in specific shamanic acts or rituals). I have tried to distinguish between shamanic and shamanistic forms of Dorset art and this has met with limited success as has been shown above. Since the results of my analysis seem to indicate that both shamanic ritual art and shamanistic amulet art increased in use in the Late Period of Dorset culture and that this was especially true in areas that may have been more prone to envi- ronmental stresses of the time, it would be insightful to examine the role art plays in stress alleviation. Many art specialists working within other culture areas have observed how artists and their art forms often have a profound and significant impact on other individuals and themselves. Roy Sieber (1975 : 430-31), for instance, has found that among African cultures an artist "produces objects or performs acts which are not only welcome in the society but which often, perhaps usually, reinforce the norms of that society". George Mills (1975 : 441) argues similarly when speak- ing of art in general and states that most societies recognize "the work of the exceptional artist as an extraordinary manifestation of the human spirit, or of the divine working through man, and therefore it places its stamp of importance upon these works". Therefore art can be spiritually important in that it allows one to express oneself in an abstract, creative sense and in this way gives one a feeling of power and control. This is especially true when combined with religion and the spiritual domain where the art forms often symbolize spiritual control over secular matters. Thus art often may be seen as a statement about the interface be- tween ordinary reality and non-ordinary reality, the secular world and the sacred or spiritual world, or as Gregory Bateson (1972 : 138) has stated, the "conscious and the unconscious". It becomes an expression of circumstance, a statement about predicament and perhaps gives both the creator and the viewer some meas- ure of confidence and control. This would be especially important in highly stress- ful times when both confidence and control may be lacking. Bateson (1972 : 146) expresses this idea further in his statement that "mere purposive rationality unaided by such phenomena as art, religion, dream, and the like, is necessarily pathogenic and destructive of life". In other words, human beings would not be able to function effectively without art, religion, dreams, or other creative expressive systems as they allow us to cope with everyday circum- stances and the stresses they may elicit. Therefore, among the late Dorset, artistic activity may have helped individuals to express unconscious tensions and desires brought about by an increasingly stressful environment. Melville Herskovits (1959 : 60) throws further light on the subject by his state- ment that many forms of art affirm "the manipulation of supernatural controls for the benefit of man". In other words, art often provides a link with the super- natural world as the power of creation flows through man into the art form. This ANALYSIS OF DORSET ART/57</page><page sequence="18">power is also sought through religious ritual and both religious ritual and artistic creation may have similar therapeutic affects on individuals in times of increased anxiety. Both seem to provoke similar or related responses and perhaps this is why they are usually so intimately bound together. "The closeness of the relation be- tween art and ritual, that is, is best referred to the emotional response which both the religious and the aesthetic experience call forth" (Herskovits 1959 : 60). Ritual and Stress Alleviation Charles Laughlin and Ivan Brady (1978) and Laughlin and Eugene d'Aquili ( 1979), among others, have found ritual to be intimately related to stress and stress alleviation among societies the world over. "The pivotal role of ritual in human adaptation is nowhere more evident than in societies under one form or another of stress" (1979 : 280). Barbara Lex (1979), on the other hand, has explored the neurobiology of ritual trance and has found that it "functions as a homeostatic mechanism for both individuals and groups" (1979 : 118). Although the one study is more psycho-anthropological in nature while the second is more biologi- cal, both conclude that ritual has a positive, socially integrating and psychological- ly reassuring affect on individuals under stress. This is very important in the con- text of late Dorset art and culture as the artistic act and amulet use may be seen as a form of individual ritual while shamanic trance sessions and the use of art forms for that purpose may be regarded as a form of group ritual. In order to more fully understand the way in which ritual alleviates stress, it is necessary to define what stress is and to make a distinction between psychological and ecological stress. Laughlin and Brady (1978 : 13) define psychological stress as "any reduction in the fundamental capacity of the organism to cognitively mediate an adaptive response to its operational environment". Ecological stress, on the other hand, is "any change in the operational environment that represents a potential or actual threat to the continued survival of the organism". Psychologi- cal and ecological stress may arise for different reasons but usually psychological stress will accompany ecological stress or will arise if ecological stress is not kept under control. Ecological stress probably occurred among the Dorset in the Late Period and, in some cases, may have elicited psychological stress. Ecological stress is normally caused by a "decrement in the quantity or type of basic resources normally available to the population. The decrement itself may derive from changes in the incidence or type of prédation, from intensification or alleviation of competition with other human or non-human populations in the ecosystem, or from climatic variations such as hurricanes, floods, droughts, and earthquakes" (Laughlin and Brady 1978 : 13). This mirrors the situation of the late Dorset as competition with other groups increases at this time and a change in climate and game patterns occurred as well. Laughlin and Brady (1978 : 13-14) and Laughlin and ďAquili (1979 : 281) state that one of the functions of ritual and the ideological domain in general, is to operate to create a buffer mechanism between ecological and psychological stress. 58/P. S. C. TAÇON</page><page sequence="19">In other words, when ecological stress arises, ritual and ideological activities in- crease in order to compensate individuals and to prevent debilitating psycholo- gical stress and anxiety. Therefore ritual activity may be seen as a form of social action designed to prevent psychological stress and to alleviate that that has al- ready arisen. Its success, however, depends on the receptivity of the individual participants (whether there is a tradition for such action in the past) and the na- ture and severity of the ecological stress that is being undergone by the group (Laughlin and Brady 1978 : 14). When ecological stress is experienced, it has been observed that the role of leaders as decision-makers becomes more crucial and "the role of tradition is en- hanced as a provenience for proper decision content" (Laughlin and Brady 1978 : 46). Because of this, "individuals who are influenced by structural decre- ments, including leaders, tend to focus on the 'tried and true' solutions to previous problems of a similar nature that have been included in the society's culture pool". Although it is speculative, it is possible that with the Dorset this would have includ- ed shamanic journeys to locate game, kill enemies, and predict the weather. As well, it might have included the use of amulets as guardian spirits that would give protection or as lucky objects that would help the hunter procure game. Both an increase in shamanic practices and general amulet use would have led to the pro- duction of more art objects. An association between a period of high stress and increased artistic activity can be seen among many other cultures but one of the more pertinent to this study is that of the Angmagsalik Eskimo. The Angmagsalik Eskimos of Eastern Green- land produced some of the most notable and elaborate art of all Greenlanders, yet most was produced when the community faced acute starvation. As Meldgaard (1967 : 56) notes, "due to climatic changes the seals had nearly disappeared and starvation was rife; the little community was stamped by manslaughter and blood- feud. But art was flourishing". Angmagsalik art is quite similar to Dorset art and Meldgaard (1960a, 1967) has continually drawn similarities and parallels. Indeed, Meldgaard (1960a : 31- 32, 1967 : 56), Collins (1967 : 26), Swinton (1972 : 111), and Taylor (1965 : 8) have all pointed out that the Angmagsalik may have partly descended from the Dorset or were at least heavily influenced by them. Meldgaard (1967 : 56) also notes that "the hard struggle for life and the fear of evil forces are evident in the artist's choice of motifs which, whether in the form of ornamental decorations or of sculptures, always have a protective purpose: to ward off evil or to wrest the quarry from evil forces". As it turns out, human, seal, and bear figures are the more common forms just as they are among the Dorset. Perhaps the Dorset had some of the same motivations when they produced their miniature sculptures a few hundred years earlier. Conclusions The Late Period of Dorset culture (after A.D. 800) seems to be characterized by change and stress. At this time a warming of climate was affecting game distrib- ANALYSIS OF DORSET ART/59</page><page sequence="20">utions throughout the Arctic and was probably causing extreme weather condi- tions in many areas. This environmental change may have had a profound effect upon Dorset groups and may have led many into areas, such as the High Arctic, in search of game. It may also have led to the extinction of some groups and caused others to come into contact with each other in geographically restricted areas. It is possible that competition among Dorset groups for faunai resources increased as a result. About the year A.D. 1000, there was an eastward migration of Thüle peoples from Alaska. Many Thüle groups may have come into contact with Dorset bands and the result may have been competition for land and food. Although there is no archaeological evidence of warfare between the two groups, it is possible that the Thüle forced some Dorset into other areas of the Arctic, possibly where they had little chance of supporting themselves. At the same time there seems to have been a florescence in art production among the Dorset. This perceived florescence is probably not due to an archae- ological sampling bias, differential preservation of art objects over time, or an increase in the Dorset population. Instead, it is probably more likely related to the other changes affecting Dorset individuals at this time and the stresses they would elicit. An increase in environmental or ecological stress would lead to an increase in psychological stress among Dorset individuals and this in turn would reduce their effectiveness as hunters and lower their chances of survival. Some Dorset groups may have tried to counter the psychological stress by increasing both group shamanic ritual and individual shamanistic amulet use. Both activities were intimately involved with art object use and both may have allowed some Dorset to subsequently combat the ecological strains of the period. In the course of this study a distinction between group and individual ritual art objects was attempted. This distinction is potentially quite important as in the past most native North American prehistoric art objects have been ascribed to shamans and the group rituals that they performed. Many scholars have argued that these group rituals had an adaptive function and reinforced the norms of so- ciety. It has been argued in this study that individual ritual and the artistic act itself may have been just as important in the past and that in any study of prehistoric art many functions of art objects should be considered. A contextual analysis of a number of Dorset art objects supported this idea in that it was found that there were no associations between specific art forms and the context from which they were recovered as would probably be the case if they were sacred shaman's objects. The number of late Dorset art objects, although relatively great, is absolutely small and therefore not all Dorset reacted so extremely. Ritual activity, whether group or individual, may therefore have increased among some groups but not all groups. In some areas, such as Dundas Island, Bathurst Island, or Button Point, it may have been especially important but at others it may have played a lesser role. Ultimately it may only have prolonged Dorset survival and did not stave off cultural extinction. By A.D. 1600 the demise of the Dorset was complete as a result of physical extinction or assimilation into Thüle groups. Today their art 60/P. S. C.
