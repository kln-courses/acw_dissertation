<plain_text><page sequence="1">GNOSTICISM AND MODERN NIHILISM BY HANS JONAS i -LNI IETZSCHE, in his time, said that nihilism, "the most uncanny of all guests," "stands before the door." x Meanwhile the guest has entered and is no longer a guest, and, as far as philosophy is concerned, existentialism is trying to live with him. Living in such company is living in a crisis. The beginnings of the crisis reach back into the seventeenth century, where the spiritual situa- tion of modern man takes shape. Among the features determining this situation, the one that Pascal faced in all its awful implications and expounded with the full force of his eloquence is man's loneliness in the physical uni- verse of modern science. "Cast into the infinite immensity of spaces of which I am ignorant, and which know me not, I am frightened." "Which know me not": more than the overawing infinity of the silent spaces and of limitless cosmic time, more than the quantitative disproportion, the insignificance of man as a magnitude in this vastness, more than these it is the utter indiffer- ence of the Copernican universe to human aspirations - the not- knowing of things human on the part of that within which ali things human have preposterously to be enacted - which consti- tutes the utter loneliness of man in the sum of things. As a part of this sum, man is only a reed, liable to be crushed at any moment by the forces of an immense and blind universe in which it is but a particular blind accident. As a thinking reed he is no part of the sum, not belonging to it, but radically differ- ent, incommensurable, for the res extensa does not think, and nature is nothing but res extensa - body, matter, external magni- l Der Wille zur Macht, ยง 34.</page><page sequence="2">GNOSTICISM AND MODERN NIHILISM 431 tude. If she crushes him, she does so unthinkingly, while he, being crushed, is aware of being crushed. He alone thinks, not because of but in spite of his being part of nature. If he has no share in nature's grandeur, which has become a foreign spectacle, nature has none in his inner concerns. Thus that which makes man superior to all nature, his unique distinction, mind, no longer results in a higher integration of his being into the totality of being, but on the contrary marks the unbridgeable gulf between himself and the rest of existence. Estranged from the community of being in one whole, his consciousness only makes him a for- eigner in the world, and in every act of true reflection tells of this stark foreignness. This is the human condition. There is no longer the cosmos with whose immanent logos my own can feel kinship, no longer the order of the whole which gives meaning to man's part in it, and therefore to his place in it. That place appears now as a sheer and brute accident. "I am frightened and shocked," continues Pascal, "at being here rather than there; for there is no reason why here rather than there, why now rather than then." There had always been a reason before, so long as the world had been regarded as life's cosmic home. But Pascal speaks of "this remote corner of nature" in which man has to "regard himself as lost," of "the little cell in which he finds himself lodged, I mean the universe." The utter contingency of man's existence in the scheme deprives that scheme of any human sense as a possible frame of reference for man's understanding of himself. But there is more to this situation than the mere mood of homelessness, forlornness, and dread. The indifference of nature also means that nature has no reference to ends. With the ejec- tion of teleology from the system of natural causes, nature, herself purposeless, ceased to provide any sanction to possible human purposes. A universe without an intrinsic hierarchy of being, as the Copernican universe is, leaves values ontologically unsup- ported, and the self is thrown back entirely upon itself in its quest for meaning and value. Meaning is no longer found, but is</page><page sequence="3">432 SOCIAL RESEARCH "given." Values are no longer beheld in the vision of objective reality, but are posited as feats of valuation. As functions of the will they are solely my own responsibility. Will replaces vision; temporality of the act ousts the eternity of the "good in itself." This is the Nietzschean phase of the situation in which European nihilism breaks the surface. Now man is alone with himself. The world's a gate To deserts stretching mute and chill. Who once has lost What thou hast lost stands nowhere still. Thus spoke Nietzsche (in Vereinsamt)- closing the poem with the line, "Woe unto him who has no home!" Pascal's universe, it is true, was still one created by God, and solitary man, bereft of all mundane props, could still stretch his heart out toward the transmundane God. But this God is essen- tially an unknown God, an agnostos theos, and is not discernible in the pattern of his creation. The universe does not reveal his purpose by its order of created things, or his goodness by their abundance, or his wisdom by their fitness, or his perfection by the beauty of the whole - but reveals solely his power, by its magni- tude, its spatial and temporal immensity. And though the con- tingency of man, of his existing here and now, is still a contingency upon God's will, that will, which has cast me into just "this remote corner of nature," is inscrutable, and the "why?" of my existence is here just as unanswerable as atheistic existentialism makes it out to be. The deus absconditus, of whom nothing but will and power can be predicated, leaves behind as his legacy, upon leaving the scene, the homo absconditus, a concept of man characterized solely by will and power - the will for power, the will to will.2 The point that particularly matters for the purposes of the present discussion is that a change in the vision of nature, that is, 2 The role of Pascal as the first modern existentialist, which I have here very roughly sketched as a starting point, has been more fully expounded by Karl Lowith in his article on "Man Between Infinites," in Measure, A Critical Journal (Chicago) , vol. i (1950), from which also the quotations from Pascal have been borrowed.</page><page sequence="4">GNOSTICISM AND MODERN NIHILISM 433 of the cosmic environment of man, is at the bottom of that meta- physical situation which has given rise to modern existentialism and to its nihilistic implications. But if this is so, if the essence of existentialism is a certain dualism, an estrangement between man and the world, with the loss of the idea of a kindred cosmos - in short, an anthropological acosmism - then it is not necessarily modern physical science alone which can create such a condition. A cosmic nihilism as such, by whatever historical circumstances it may have been begotten, would be the condition in which some of the characteristic traits of existentialism might evolve. And the extent to which this is found to be actually the case would be a test for the relevance which we attribute to the described element in the existentialist position. There is one situation, and one only that I know of in the his- tory of Western man, where - on a level untouched by anything resembling modern scientific thought - that condition has been realized and lived out with all the vehemence of a cataclysmic event. That is the Gnostic movement, or the more radical ones among the various Gnostic movements and teachings, which the deeply agitated first three centuries of the Christian era prolif- erated in the Hellenistic parts of the Roman empire and beyond its eastern boundaries. From them, therefore, we may hope to learn something for an understanding of that disturbing subject, nihilism, and I wish to put the evidence before the reader as far as this can be done in the space of a brief essay. n The existence of an affinity or analogy across the ages, such as is here alleged, is not so surprising if we remember that in more than one respect the cultural situation in the Greco-Roman world of the first Christian centuries shows broad parallels with the mod- ern situation. Spengler went so far as to declare the two ages "contemporaneous/1 in the sense of being identical phases in the life cycle of their respective cultures. In this analogical sense we would now be living in the period of the early Caesars. However</page><page sequence="5">434 SOCIAL RESEARCH that may be, there is certainly more than mere coincidence in the fact that we recognize ourselves in so many facets of later post- classical antiquity. Gnosticism is one of those facets, and here recognition, difficult as it is rendered by the strangeness of the symbols, comes with the shock of the unexpected, because it fits neither the picture of an age which a superficial historical con- sciousness characterizes mostly by Stoicism and Epicureanism, nor the picture of modern nihilism as - in line with the Nietzschean definition - essentially a post-Christian phenomenon. In the following discussion I refer to existentialism as more or less a known quantity. Unfortunately I cannot do the same witti Gnosticism. It lies off the main road of historical knowledge, and philosophers do not usually come across it. I am therefore compelled to dwell much more on the Gnostic side of my subject than a just balance in the comparison would warrant. In the circumstances, however, I do not see how this lopsidedness in my presentation can be avoided. The term Gnostic refers to a group of religious doctrines at the beginning of our era which either explicitly identified them- selves by the word gnosis or implied it as a central point of their message.3 Gnosis means knowledge, and the historical connota- tions of the term have caused many observers, ancient and modern, to see in Gnosticism the inroad of Greek philosophy into Oriental religious thought. In content, manner, and aim, however, the "knowledge" of the Gnostics has little to do with rational thought, and the Hellenic associations of the name are more misleading than enlightening. Also easily misleading is the fact that the majority of the recorded Gnostic sects appear within the still fluid boundaries of the early church, thus investing the very name, in the minds of observers, with the meaning of a Christian heresy, a mere epiphe- 3 What follows is a brief summary of certain basic features of Gnosticism. The full argument for the view presented here, which differs from the conventional one, may be found in my Gnosis und spรคtantiker Geist, vol. i (Gรถttingen 1934). Note also two articles of mine on this subject in Theologische Zeitschrift (Basel) : vol. 4, no. 2 (1948) , and vol. 5, no. 1 (1949)-</page><page sequence="6">GNOSTICISM AND MODERN NIHILISM 435 nomenon to Christianity. Modern research, however, has shown the existence of non-Christian Gnostic religions as well, coincident with the rise of Christianity in the declining ancient world, and there is evidence even of pre-Christian Gnosticism. As a matter of fact, the Gnostic movement - such we must call it - was a com- prehensive phenomenon in those critical centuries, feeding like Christianity on the impulses of a widely prevalent human situa- tion, and therefore erupting in many places, many forms, and many languages. The salient feature to be emphasized here is the radically dual- istic mood which underlies the whole Gnostic attitude and unifies the widely diversified, more or less systematic expressions which that attitude gave itself in Gnostic ritual and literature. It is on this primary human foundation of a dualistic mood, a passionately felt experience of man, that the formulated dualistic doctrines rest. The dualism is between man and the world, and concur- rently between the world and God. It is a duality not of supple- mentary but of contrary terms, a polarity of incompatibles, and this fact dominates Gnostic eschatology. Basic to it is the feeling of an absolute rift between man and that in which he finds himself lodged: the world. The feeling is explicated in terms of doctrine. In its theological aspect it states that the Divine has no part and no concern in the physical universe; that the true God, strictly transmundane, is not revealed or even indicated by the world, and is therefore the Unknown, the totally Other, unknowable in terms of any worldly analogies. Correspondingly, in its cosmologi- cal aspect it states that the world is the creation not of God but of some inferior principle; and, in its anthropological aspect, that man's inner self - called the pneuma - is not part of the world, of nature's creation and domain, but, within that world, is as totally transcendent and as unknown by all worldly categories as is its transmundane counterpart, the unknown God without. That the world is created by someone is generally not doubted in the mythological systems (though in some of the subtler systems a sort of dark autogenesis from orts of divinity is contemplated).</page><page sequence="7">436 SOCIAL RESEARCH But whoever has created the world, man, according to Gnosticism, does not owe him allegiance; and neither his creation, though incomprehensibly encompassing man, nor his proclaimed will offers the standards by which man can set his course. Since the true God cannot be the creator of that to which selfhood feels so utterly a stranger, nature must have been created by a lowly demiurge, a power far removed from the supreme source of Being, a perversion of the Divine, retaining of it only the power to act, but to act blindly, without knowledge; he created the world out of ignorance and passion. Thus the world is the product, and even essentially the embodi- ment, of the negative of knowledge. What it reveals is unen- lightened and therefore malignant force, proceeding from the spirit of self-assertive power, from the will to rule and coerce - which, as spiritual, is foolish and bears no relation to understand- ing and love. The laws of the universe are the laws of this rule, and not of divine wisdom. Thus the essence of the cosmos is ignorance (agnosia). In this negativity the idea of knowledge (gnosis) finds its first application, an application in the privative mood. The positive complement is in the fact that the essence of man is knowledge: this determines the situation of man as that of the knowing in the midst of the unknowing, of light in the midst of darkness, and this relation is at the bottom of his being alien, without companionship in the dark vastness of the universe. That universe has none of the venerability of the Greek cosmos. Contemptuous epithets are applied to it: "these miserable ele- ments" (paupertina haec elementa), "this puny cell of the creator" (haec cellula creatoris) - both quotations from Marcion, the second offering literally the same expression that we found in Pascal. Yet it is still cosmos, an order - but order with a vengeance. Not only is the name cosmos retained for the world; it is called that now with a new and fearful emphasis, an emphasis at once awed and disrespectful, troubled and rebellious, for that order is alien to man's aspirations. The blemish of nature lies not in any defi- ciency of order, but in the all too pervading completeness of it.</page><page sequence="8">GNOSTICISM AND MODERN NIHILISM 437 Far from being chaos, the creation of the demiurge, that antitype of knowing, is a comprehensive system, governed by law. But cosmic law, once regarded as the expression of a reason with which man's reason can communicate in the act of cognition, is now seen only in its aspect of compulsion which thwarts man's free- dom. The cosmic logos of the Stoics is replaced by heimarmene, oppressive cosmic fate. This heimarmene is dispensed by the planets, or the stars in general, the mythical exponents of the inexorable and hostile law of the universe. The change in the emotional content of the term cosmos is nowhere better symbolized than in this depreciation of the formerly most divine part of the visible world, the celestial spheres. The starry sky - which from Plato to the Stoics was the purest embodiment of reason in the cosmic hierarchy, the para- digm of intelligibility and therefore of the divine nature of reality as such - now stared man in the face with the fixed glare of alien power and necessity. Its rule is tyranny, and not providence. Deprived of the venerability with which all sideric piety up to then had invested it, but still in possession of the prominent and representative position it had acquired, this stellar firmament becomes now the symbol of all that is terrifying to man in the towering factness of the universe. Under this pitiless sky, which no longer inspires worshipful confidence, man becomes conscious of his utter forlornness, of his being not so much a part of, but unaccountably placed in and exposed to, the enveloping system. And, like Pascal, he is frightened. His solitary otherness, dis- covering itself in this forlornness, erupts in the feeling of ele- mentary dread. Dread as a fundamental mood of being-in-the- world first became articulate not in existentialism but in the Gnostic writings. It is the self's reaction to the discovery of its situation, actually itself an element in that discovery: it marks the awakening of selfhood from the slumber or intoxication of the world; it is the way in which the inmost spirit becomes origi- nally aware of itself and of the fact that it is not really its own, but is rather the involuntary executor of cosmic designs. Knowl-</page><page sequence="9">438 SOCIAL RESEARCH edge, gnosis, might liberate man from this servitude; but since the cosmos is contrary to life, the saving knowledge cannot aim at the knower's integration into the cosmic whole, cannot aim at compliance with the laws of the universe, as did Stoic wisdom, which sought freedom in the knowing affirmation of universal necessity. For the Gnostics, contrary to the Stoics, man's aliena- tion is not to be overcome, but is to be deepened and pushed to the extreme for the sake of the self's redemption. in Before going any further, let us stop to ask what has here happened to the old idea of the cosmos as a divinely ordered whole. Cer- tainly nothing comparable to modern physical science was involved in this catastrophic devaluation or spiritual denudation of the universe. We need only observe that this universe became thoroughly demonized in the Gnostic period. Yet this, taken with the transcendence of the acosmic self, resulted in curious analogies to the phenomena of existentialism in the vastly different modern setting. If not science and technology, what caused, for the human groups involved, the collapse of the cosmos piety of classical civi- lization, on which so much of its ethics was built? The answer is certainly complex, but at least one angle of it may be briefly indicated. The classical ontological doctrine of whole and parts - according to which the whole is prior to the parts, is better than the parts, and is that for the sake of which; the parts are and wherein they find the meaning of their exist- ence - had lost the social basis of its validity. The living example of such a whole had been the classical polis, whose citizens had a stake in the whole, and could affirm its superior status in the knowledge that they, the parts, however passing and exchangeable, maintained it with their own being, and that their actions made a difference to the being and perfection of the whole. This whole, the condition for the existence and wellbeing of the individual, was thus in addition the framework for the fulfilment of man's aspirations.</page><page sequence="10">GNOSTICISM AND MODERN NIHILISM 439 The ontological principle survived the conditions of its con- ception. With the absorption of the city states into the monarchies of the Diadochs and finally into the Roman empire, which deprived the polis intelligentsia of its constructive function, the relation no longer held politically. But Stoic pantheism, the physico-theology of post-Aristotelian monism, substituted for it the relation between the individual and the cosmos, the larger living whole. By this substitution the classical doctrine of whole and parts was kept in force even though it no longer reflected the actual situation of man. Now the cosmos was declared to be the great "city of gods and men," and to be a citizen of the uni- verse, a cosmopolites, was now considered to be the goal by which otherwise isolated man could set his bearings. He was asked, as it were, to adopt the cause of the universe as his own, that is, to identify himself with that cause directly, across all intermediaries, and to relate his inner self, to relate his logos, to the logos of thรฉ whole. The practical side of this identification consisted in his affirm- ing and faithfully performing the role allotted to him by the whole, in just that place in which cosmic destiny had set him. "To play one's part" - that figure of speech on which Stoic morals dwelt so much - unwittingly reveals the fictitious element in the structure. A role played is substituted for a real function per- formed. The actors on the stage behave "as if" they acted their choice, and "as if" their actions mattered. What actually matters is only to play well rather than badly, with no genuine relevance to the outcome. The actors, bravely playing, are their own audience. In the phrase of playing one's part there is a bravado that hides a deeper despair, and only a shift in attitude is needed to view the great spectacle quite differently. Does the whole really care, does it concern itself in the part that is I? The Stoics averred that it does by equating heimarmene with pronoia, cosmic fate with providence. And does my part, however I play it, really contribute, does it make a difference to the whole? The Stoics</page><page sequence="11">440 SOCIAL RESEARCH averred that it does by their analogy between the cosmos and the city. But the very comparison brings out the artificiality of the construction, for - in contrast to what is true in the polis - no case can be made out for my relevance in the cosmic scheme, which is entirely outside my control and in which my part is thus reduced to a passivity which in the polis it had not. To be sure, the strained fervor by which man's integration in the whole was maintained, through his alleged affinity to it, was the means of preserving the dignity of man and thereby of saving a sanction for a positive morality. This fervor, succeeding that which had formerly been inspired by the ideal of civic virtue, represented a heroic attempt on the part of the intellectuals to carry over the life-sustaining force of that ideal into fundamen- tally changed conditions. But the new atomized masses of the empire, who had never shared in that noble tradition of arete, reacted very differently to a situation in which they found them- selves passively involved: a situation in which the part was insig- nificant to the whole, and the whole alien to the parts. The Gnostic aspiration was not to "act a part" in this whole, but - in existentialist parlance - to "exist authentically." The law of empire, under which they found themselves, was an external dispensation of dominating, unapproachable force; and, for them, the same character was assumed by the law of the universe, cosmic destiny, of which the world state was the terrestrial executor. The very concept of law was modified in all its aspects - natural law, political law, moral law. I leave it to the reader to draw whatever analogies there are between this alienation of man from his world and the situation of atomized industrial society. Such analogies, I am sure, would supplement from the social angle the effects I have attributed to the cosmology of modern science, on the testimony of Pascal. As in late antiquity, so today, the term "world" contains two mean- ings at once: nature in general, and social reality. And it may well be the latter which preeminently determines man's relation to "the world," the sum of things.</page><page sequence="12">GNOSTICISM AND MODERN NIHILISM 441 IV The subversion of the idea of law, of nomos, leads to a moral consequence in which the nihilistic implications of the Gnostic acosmism, and at the same time the analogy to the Nietzsche- Heidegger-Sartre strain of existentialism, become even more obvi- ous than in the cosmological aspect: the antinomism of Gnosticism. To begin with, it is to be conceded that antinomism - the rejec- tion of any objective norm of conduct - is argued on vastly differ- ent theoretical levels in the two cases, and that antinomistic Gnos- ticism appears crude, and perhaps less profound, in comparison with the subtlety and pitiless historical self-elucidation of anti- nomistic existentialism. What is being liquidated, in the one case, is the moral heritage of a thousand years of ancient civilization; added to this, in the other, are two thousand years of Occidental Christian metaphysics as background to the idea of a moral law. Nietzsche expressed the root of the nihilistic situation in the phrase "God is dead," meaning primarily the Christian God. The Gnostics, if asked to summarize similarly the metaphysical basis of their own nihilism, could have said only "the God of the cosmos is dead" - is dead, that is, as a god, has ceased to be divine for us and therefore to afford the lodestar for our lives. Admit- tedly the catastrophe in this case is less comprehensive and thus less irremediable, but the vacuum that was left, even if not so bottomless, was felt no less keenly. To Nietzsche the meaning of nihilism is that "the highest values become devaluated" (or "invalidated"), and the cause of this devaluation is "the insight that we have not the slightest justifi- cation for positing a transcendence, or an 'in itself of things, which is 'divine/ which is morality incarnate." 4 This utterance, taken with that about the death of God, bears out Heidegger's statement that "the names God and Christian God are in Nietz- sche's thought used to denote the transcendental (supra-sensible) world in general. God is the name for the realm of ideas and 4 Wille zur Macht, ยงยง 23, 24; cf. ibid., ยง 4, "to live alone, 'without God and morals.' "</page><page sequence="13">442 SOCIAL RESEARCH ideals" (Holzwege, p. 199). Since it is from this realm alone that any sanction for values can derive, its fading, that is, the "death of God," means not only the actual devaluation of highest values, but the loss of the very possibility of obligatory values as such. To quote once more Heidegger's interpretation of Nietzsche, "The phrase 'God is dead* means that the transcendental world is without effective force." In a modified, rather paradoxical way this statement applies also to the Gnostic position. It is true, of course, that its extreme dualism is of itself the very opposite of an abandonment of tran- scendence. The transmundane God represents transcendence in the most radical form. In him the absolute beyond beckons across the enclosing cosmic shells. But this transcendence, unlike the "intelligible world" of Platonism or the world lord of Judaism, does not stand in any positive relation to the sensible world. It is not the essence of that world, but its negation and cancelation. The Gnostic God, as distinct from the demiurge, is the totally different, the other, the unknown. Like his inner-human counter- part, the acosmic self or pneuma, which, otherwise hidden, also reveals itself only in the negative experience of otherness, of non- identification and of protested indefinable freedom, this God has more of the nihil than the ens in his concept. A transcendence withdrawn from any normative relation to the world is equal to a transcendence which has lost its effective force. In other words, for all purposes of man's relation to existing reality, this hidden God is a nihilistic conception: no nomos emanates from him, no law for nature and thus also no law for human conduct as a part of the natural order. On this basis the antinomistic argument of the Gnostics is as simple as for instance that of Sartre. Since the transcendent is silent, Sartre argues, since "there is no sign in the world," man, the "abandoned," reclaims his freedom, or rather, cannot help taking it upon himself: he "is" that freedom, man being "nothing but his own project," and "all is permitted to him."5 That this 5 L'existentialisme est un humanisme, pp. 33 ff.</page><page sequence="14">GNOSTICISM AND MODERN NIHILISM 443 freedom is of a desperate nature, and, as a compassless task, inspires dread rather than exultation, is a different matter. In Gnostic reasoning we sometimes meet the merely subjectivist form of the antinomistic argument: nothing is naturally bad or good, things in themselves are indifferent, and only by human opinion are actions good or bad. Spiritual man, in the freedom of his knowledge, has the indifferent use of them all. While this reminds one of nothing more than of classical Sophism, the real metaphysical background to this superficially skeptical subjectiv- ism comes to light in the deeper Gnostic reflection on the source of such human opinions. The ultimate source turns out to be not human but demiurgical, and common with that of the order of nature. Its product, the "law/1 is thus not really indifferent, but is part of the great design upon our freedom. Being nomos, the moral code is but the psychical complement to the physical nomos and, as such, the internal aspect of the all-pervading cosmic rule. Both emanate from the lord of the world as agencies of his power, unified in the double aspect of the Jewish God as creator and legislator. Just as the law of the physical world, the heimarmene, integrates the individual bodies into the general system, so the moral law integrates the souls, and thus makes them subservient to the dem- iurgic scheme. For what is the law - either as revealed through Moses and the prophets or as operating in the actual habits and opinions of men - but the means of regularizing and thus stabilizing the impli- cation of man in the business of the world and worldly concerns; of setting by its rules the seal of seriousness, of praise and blame, reward and punishment, on his utter involvement; of making his very will a compliant party to the compulsory system, which thereby will function all the more smoothly and inextricably? In so far as the principle of this moral law is justice, it has the same character of constraint on the psychical side that cosmic fate has on the physical side. "The angels that created the world estab- lished 'just actions/ to lead men by such precepts into servitude"</page><page sequence="15">444 SOCIAL RESEARCH (Simon Magus). In the normative law man's will is taken care of by the same powers that dispose of his body. He who obeys it has abdicated the authority of his self. It is not possible here to go into the anarchical and sometimes libertinistic consequences of this attitude. Incidentally, the con- sequences can be either libertinistic or ascetic, and actually, except for a brief period of revolutionary extremism, they have probably more often been the latter than the former. But the two seem- ingly opposite attitudes are really of the same root, and are capa- ble of strange combinations. The same basic argument supports them both. The one repudiates loyalty to nature through excess, the other through abstention. The one sometimes makes of the permission to do everything a positive obligation to perform every kind of action, with the idea of rendering to nature its own and thereby exhausting its powers; the other flouts those powers by denying them opportunity and reducing commerce with them to the minimum. Both are lives outside the law. Freedom by abuse and freedom by non-use, equal in their indiscriminateness, are thus only alternative expressions of the same acosmism. The reference to this root makes it clear that, far beyond what the merely skeptical argument of "subjectivism" suggests, there was a positive metaphysical interest in repudiating allegiance to any objective norm. It was the assertion of the authentic freedom of the self. But it is to be noted that this freedom is not a matter of the "soul," which is as adequately determined by the moral law as the body is by the physical law; it is wholly a matter of the pneuma, the indefinable spiritual core of existence, the foreign spark. The soul, psyche, is part of the natural order, created by the demiurge to envelop the foreign pneuma, and in the norma- tive law the creator exercises control over what is legitimately his own. Psychical man, definable in his natural essence, for instance as rational animal, is still natural man, and is no more admitted to be the authentically existing self of the pneuma than in mod- ern existentialism any determinative essence is admitted to prej- udice authentic existence.</page><page sequence="16">GNOSTICISM AND MODERN NIHILISM 445 It is pertinent here to compare an argument of Heidegger's. Against the classical definition of man as the rational animal, Heidegger, in his Letter on Humanism, argues that this defini- tion places man within animality specified only by a differentia which falls within the genus "animal" as a particular quality. This, Heidegger contends, is placing man too low. I suspect there is a verbal sophism involved in thus arguing from the term "animal" as used in the classical definition. But apart from that, in his rejection of the concept of any definable "nature" of man which would subject his sovereign existence to a predetermined essence and thus make him part of an objective order of essences in the whole of nature - in this whole conception of trans-essen- tial, freely "projecting" existence - there is a significant analogy to the Gnostic concept of the trans-psychical negativity of the pneuma. This pneuma is the bearer of a knowledge peculiar to itself which is radically different from the rational knowledge of the psyche. Psychical man, through his reason, owes allegiance, indeed, to the moral law laid down by his creator, the demiurge, and in obediently fulfilling it he has the only chance of being just, that is, properly "adjusted" to the externally established order, and thus of playing his allotted part in the cosmic scheme. But the pneumรกticos, "spiritual" man, is above the law, beyond good and evil, and a law unto himself in the power of his "knowledge." Only in passing I wish to remark that Paul's antinomism, though sharing in the general climate of the Gnostic one, is a vastly different matter. It certainly does not grant freedom from the law to any superior "knowledge." v But what is this knowledge about, this cognition which is not of the soul but of the spirit, and in which the spiritual self finds its salvation from cosmic servitude? A famous formula of the Valen- tinian school thus epitomizes the content of gnosis: "What makes us free is the knowledge who we were, what we have become;</page><page sequence="17">446 SOCIAL RESEARCH where we were, wherein we have been thrown; whereto we speed, wherefrom we are redeemed; what is birth and what rebirth." 6 A real exegesis of this programmatic formula would have to unfold the complete Gnostic myth. Here I wish to make only a few formal observations. First we note the dualistic grouping of the terms in antithetical pairs, and the eschatological tension between them, with its irre- versible directedness from past to future. We further observe that all the terms used are concepts not of being but of happening, of movement. The knowledge is of a history, in which it is itself a critical event. Among these terms of motion, the one of having "been thrown" into something strikes our attention, because we have been made familiar with it in existentialist literature. We are reminded of Pascal's "Cast into the infinite immensity of spaces," of Heideg- ger's Geworfenheit; "having been thrown," which with him is a fundamental character of the Dasein, of the self-experience of existence. The term, as far as I can see, is originally Gnostic. In the Mandaean literature it is a standing phrase: life has been thrown into the world, light into darkness, the soul into the body. It expresses the original violence done to me in making me be where I am and what I am, the passivity of my choiceless emer- gence into an existing world whose law is not mine. But the image of the throw also imparts a dynamic character to the whole of the existence thus initiated. In our formula this is taken up by the image of speeding toward some end. Ejected into the world, life is a kind of trajectory projecting itself forward into the future. This brings us to the last observation I wish to make apropos the Valen tinian formula: that in its temporal terms it makes no provision for a present on whose content knowledge may dwell and, in beholding, stay the forward thrust. There is past and future, where we come from and where we speed to, and the present is only the moment of gnosis itself, the peripety from e Clemens Alex., Exc. ex Theod., 78, 2.</page><page sequence="18">GNOSTICISM AND MODERN NIHILISM 447 the one to the other in a supreme crisis of the eschatological now. There is this to remark, however, in distinction to all modern parallels: the context makes it clear that, though thrown into temporality, we had an origin in eternity, and so also have an aim in eternity. This constitutes a metaphysical background to innercosmic nihilism which is entirely absent from its modern counterpart. To turn once more to the modern counterpart, let me put before you an observation which must strike the close student of Heidegger's Sein und Zeit, that most profound and still most important manifesto of existentialist philosophy. In this book Heidegger develops an ontology of the self according to the modes in which it exists, that is to say, in which it constitutes its being by its existing, and these modes are explicated in a number of fundamental categories which Heidegger prefers to call "existen- tials." Unlike the objective categories of Kant, they define struc- tures not of reality but of realization - of the active movement of inwardness by which a world of objects is entertained and the self originated as a continuous event. They have, therefore, each and all, a profoundly temporal meaning. The ' 'existen tials" are categories of internal or mental time, the true dimension of exist- ence, and they articulate that dimension in its tenses. This being so, they must exhibit, and distribute between themselves, the three horizons of time - past, present, and future. Now if we try to arrange these * 'existen tials," Heidegger's cate- gories of existence, under these three heads, as it is possible to do, we make a striking discovery - at any rate one that struck me very much when I made it many years ago (at the time even going so far as to draw up a diagram, in the classical manner of a "table of categories"). This is the discovery that the column under the head of "present" remains practically empty. I must hasten to add that this statement, and what follows, is an extreme abridge- ment. Actually a great deal is said about the existential "present." But it is nothing original in its own right. As far as the term is meant to denote an aspect of genuine "existence," it is the</page><page sequence="19">448 SOCIAL RESEARCH present of the ' 'situation/' which is wholly defined in terms of the self's relation to its "future" and "past." It flashes up, as it were, in the light of decision when the projected "future" reacts upon the given "past," and in this meeting constitutes what Hteidegger calls the "moment" (Augenblick): moment, not dura- tion, is the temporal mode of this present - a creature of the other two horizons of time, a function of their ceaseless dynamics, and no independent dimension to dwell in. Detached, however, from this context of inner movement, by itself, "present" denotes precisely the renouncement of genuine future-past relation in the "abandonment" or "surrender" to talk, curiosity, and the like (Verfallenheit): a failure of the tension of true existence, a kind of laziness of being. Indeed, Verfallenheit, a negative term which also includes the meaning of degeneration and decline, is the "existential" proper to "present" as such, showing it to be a derivative and "deficient" mode of existence. To return, then, to our original statement, we find that all the relevant categories of existence, those having to do with the possible genuineness of existence, fall in correlate pairs under the heads of either past or future: "facticity," necessity, having become, having been thrown, are existential modes of the past; being ahead of oneself, anticipation of death, care and resolve, are existential modes of the future. No present remains for genuine existence to repose in. Leaping off, as it were, from its past, existence projects itself into its future; faces its ultimate limit, death; returns from this eschatological glimpse of nothing- ness to its sheer factness, the unalterable datum of its already having become this, there and then; and carries this forward with its death-begotten resolve, into which the past has now been gathered up. I repeat, there is no present to dwell in, only the crisis between past and future, the pointed moment between, balanced on the razor's edge of decision which thrusts ahead. This breathless dynamism holds a tremendous appeal for the contemporary mind, and my generation in the German twenties and early thirties succumbed to it wholesale. But there is a</page><page sequence="20">GNOSTICISM AND MODERN NIHILISM 449 puzzle in this evanescence of the present as the holder of genuine content, in its reduction to the inhospitable zero point of mere formal resolution. What metaphysical situation stands behind it? Here an additional observation is relevant. There is, after all, besides the existential "present" of the moment, the presence of things. Does not the co-presence with them afford a "present" of a different kind? But we learn from Heidegger that things are primarily zuhanden, that is, usable (of which even "useless" is a mode), and therefore related to the "project" of existence, therefore included in the future-past dynamics. Yet they can also become merely vorhanden (standing before me), that is, indifferent objects, and the mode of Vorhandenheit is an objec- tive counterpart to what on the existential side is Verfallenheit, false present. Vorhanden is what is merely and indifferently "extant," the "there" of bare nature, there to be looked at out- side the relevance of the existential situation and of practical concern. It is being, as it were, stripped and alienated to the mode of neutral object. This is the status left to "nature" - a deficient mode of reality - and the relation in which it is so objectified is a deficient mode of existence, its defection from the futurity of care into the spurious present of mere onlooking curiosity. This existentialist depreciation of the concept of nature (the absence of "nature" as a relevant topic from Heidegger's phi- losophy is in itself a revealing fact) obviously reflects its spiritual denudation at the hands of physical science, and it has something in common with the Gnostic contempt for nature. No philosophy has ever been less concerned about nature, which, for it, has no dignity left to it: this unconcern is not to be confounded with Socrates' refraining from physical inquiry as being above man's understanding. To look at what is there, at nature as it is in itself, at Being, the ancients called by the name of contemplation, theoria. But the point here is that, if contemplation is left with only the irrelevantly extant, then it loses the noble status it once had -</page><page sequence="21">450 SOCIAL RESEARCH as does the repose in the present to which it holds by the pres- ence of its objects. Theoria had that dignity because of its Platonic implications - because it beheld eternal objects in the forms of things, a transcendence of immutable being shining through the transparency of becoming. Immutable being is everlasting present, in which contemplation can share in the brief durations of the temporal present. Thus it is eternity, not time, that grants a present and gives it a status of its own in the flux of time; and it is the loss of eternity which accounts for the loss of a genuine present. Such a loss of eternity is the disappearance of the world of ideas and ideals in which Heidegger sees the true meaning of Nietzsche's "God is dead": in other words, the absolute victory of nominalism over realism. Therefore the same cause which is at the root of nihilism is also at the root of the radical temporality of Heideg- ger's scheme of existence, in which the present is nothing but the moment of transience from past to future. If values are not beheld in vision as being (like the Good and the Beautiful of Plato), but are posited by the will as projects, then indeed exist- ence is committed to constant futurity, with death as the goal; and a merely formal resolution to be, without a nomos for that resolution, becomes a project from nothingness into nothingness. In the words of Nietzsche quoted before, "Who once has lost what thou hast lost stands nowhere still." VI Once more our investigation leads back to the dualism between man and physis as the metaphysical background of the nihilistic situation. There is no overlooking one cardinal difference between the Gnostic and the existentialist dualism: Gnostic man is thrown into an antagonistic, anti-divine, and therefore anti- human nature, modern man into an indifferent one. And only the latter case represents the absolute vacuum, the really bottom- less pit. In the Gnostic conception the hostile, the demonic, is still anthropomorphic, familiar even in its foreignness, and the</page><page sequence="22">GNOSTICISM AND MODERN NIHILISM 451 contrast itself gives direction to existence - a negative direction, to be sure, but one that has behind it the sanction of the nega- tive transcendence to which the positivity of the world is the qualitative counterpart. Not even this antagonistic quality is granted to the indifferent nature of modern science, and from that nature no direction at all can be elicited. This makes modern nihilism infinitely more radical and more desperate than Gnostic nihilism ever could be, for all its panic terror of the world and its defiant contempt of its laws. That nature does not care, one way or the other, is the true abyss. That only man cares, in his finitude facing nothing but death, alone with his contingency and the objective meaninglessness of his projecting meanings, is a truly unprecedented situation. But this difference, which reveals the greater depth of modern nihilism, also challenges its self-consistency. Gnostic dualism, fantastic as it was, was at least self-consistent. The idea of a demonic nature against which the self is pitted, makes sense. But what about an indifferent nature which nevertheless contains in its midst something to which its own being does make a difference? The phrase of having been flung into indifferent nature is a remnant from a dualistic metaphysics, a phrase to whose use the existentialists' own monistic beliefs give them no right. What is the throw without the thrower, and without a beyond whence it started? Rather should the existentialist say that life - conscious, caring, knowing self - has been "thrown up" by nature. If blindly, then the seeing is a product of the blind, the caring a product of the uncaring, a teleological nature begot- ten unteleologically. Does not this paradox cast doubt on the very concept of an indifferent nature, that abstraction of physical science? So radi- cally has anthropomorphism been banned from the concept of nature that even man must cease to be conceived anthropomor- phically if he is just an accident of that nature. As the product of the indifferent, his being, too, must be indifferent. Then the facing of his mortality would simply warrant the reaction "Let</page><page sequence="23">452 SOCIAL RESEARCH us eat and drink for tomorrow we die." There is no point in caring for what has no sanction behind it in any creative intention. But if the deeper insight of Heidegger is right - that, facing our finitude, we find that we care, not only whether we exist but how we exist - then the mere fact of there being such a supreme care, anywhere within the world, must also qualify the totality which harbors that fact, and, having given rise to it physically, cannot be only the indifferent externality of a-teleological science. The disruption between man and total reality is at the bottom of nihilism. The illogicality of the rupture makes its fact no less real, or its seeming alternative more acceptable: the stare at isolated selfness, to which it commits man, may seek release - and has found it - in a monistic naturalism which, along with the rupture, would abolish also the idea of man as man. Between that Scylla and this her twin Charybdis, the modern mind hovers. Whether a third road is open to it - one by which the fatal dual- ism can be overcome and yet enough of the dualistic insight saved to uphold the humanity of man - philosophy will have to find out.</page></plain_text>
