OLGUiN So much work remains to be done around prisons in general - pending revo- lutionary change, we have to raise the demand that prisons in their present form be abolished. As an inevitable by-product of a male-oriented society and consequently still male-oriented movement - which women are however in- creasingly contesting - sufficient attention has not been devoted to women in prison. Angela Davis, "Letter to Ericka Huggins" The work of mestiza consciousness is to break down the subject-object duality that keeps her a prisoner and to show in the flesh and through the images in her work how duality is transcended. The answer to the problem between the white race and the colored, between males and females, lies in healing the split that originates in the very foundation of our lives, our culture, our languages, our thoughts. A mas- sive uprooting of dualistic thinking in the individual and collective consciousness is the beginning of a long struggle, but one that could, in our best hopes, bring us to the end of rape, of violence, of war. Gloria Anzaldfia, Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza Consciousness PRISONS, POWER, AND CHICANA POETRY In the introduction to the 1996 watershed study The Real War on Crime, Steven Donziger notes that the draconian 1994 National Crime Bill and attendant prison construction boom have effectively created a new industry in the United States that conveniently fills the economic void resulting from the de- cline of the military industrial complex after the end of the Cold War.' This new industry, which he dubs the "Prison Industrial Complex," is built atop a Olguin: Lucero's Gynocritical Prison Poetics and Materialist Chicana Politics 63</page><page sequence="2">new domestic enemy - criminals. The Prison Project, a Washington DC, prison reform research center, confirms that this criminalized domestic population is disproportionately comprised of racial minorities, especially African Ameri- cans, who have the highest incarceration rate in the country. According to Prison Project Director Marc Mauer, one in four black men between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four will be caught in the criminal justice web of prison, jail, probation, or parole at least once in his lifetime.! The U.S. Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics similarly reports that the disparities in incarceration rates are even more acute for women. It notes that while women currently make up only 6.3 percent of the U.S. popu- lation under correctional supervision, their rate of incarceration is growing al- most twice as fast as the incarceration rate for men.3 In her research on Chi- cana and other women prisoners in California, Yvette Flores-Ortiz suggests that this disparity in incarceration rates for women may in part be attributable to the claim frequently made by women prisoners that they were incarcerated for crimes that were coerced, or even committed, by their male partners, for whom they "took the fall" under the mistaken belief that a woman would get a more lenient sentence.4 Surveys conducted by the U.S. Department of Justice also reveal that prior to their own imprisonment, the majority of these women prisoners had been victims of child abuse, sexual assault, domestic violence, or coerced drug abuse involving older men; in other words, crimes committed against them by men presaged these women's incarceration.5 Even more trou- bling, some researchers have estimated that as many as one in sixteen women are pregnant upon entering prison, while the U.S. Department of Justice adds that over 78 percent of the roughly one million women under correctional su- pervision in jail, prison, probation, or parole are mothers.6 Judy A. Lucero was one of them. Renowned as a prisoner who earned the endearing prison epithet "soft touch" for frequently having gone into debt to lend money to her friends, Lucero also typified other characteristics of women prisoners in the U.S.: She was a lumpenproletariat Chicana introduced to drugs at the age of eleven; a victim of brutal domestic violence that caused her to miscarry twice; a drug user addicted first to heroin then to the "cure," methadone; a mother forcibly separated from her daughter on account of her convictions and incarceration; and, finally, a woman who died in prison of a brain hemorrhage, the cumulative effect of a lifetime of beatings.7 But Lucero, like many other prisoners, is not simply or solely a victim. In- deed, I have shown elsewhere in my examination of Chicano prisoner art, lit- erature, and politics that prisoners oftentimes participate in various alternative commodifications and reclamations of their criminalized subjectivities.8 How- ever, unlike the hypermasculinist poetics and homosocial politics of (male) Chicano prisoners' signifying practices - which oftentimes merge both sacred 64 FRONTIERS/2001/VOL.XXII, NO. 2</page><page sequence="3">and profane images of women and thus inadvertently keep intact the phallic resonance of the panoptic penitentiary guard tower they seek to subvert - Chi- cana prisoner literature is invested with a unique poetic and political texture. Drawing upon Foucault's compelling explication of the power dynamics of panopticism and, more importantly, feminist critiques of his "degendering of the disciplined body," as well as his undertheorized model of resistance (espe- cially by prisoners), I propose to examine how Lucero's embodied poetics challenges masculinist and defeatist reifications of hegemony.9 More precisely, following Barbara Harlow's historicist linkage of embodied forms of protest to the development of a "resistance literature" by women prisoners in the colo- nial and postcolonial worlds and Juanita Diaz-Cotto's thesis that women pris- oners' reconstructions of "family" kinship networks pose complex challenges to the highly gendered forms of containment women experience in prison, I argue that Judy Lucero figuratively critiques and challenges the patriarchal reg- imen of truth that undergirds her imprisonment.10 I submit that Judy Lucero's three collections of autobiographical prison verse, published posthumously from 1973 to 1980, seek to reappropriate the multiple abject subjectivities that figure her as a "fallen woman" and undergird efforts to "rehouse" her in prison, which Angela Davis proposes as the quin- tessential site of patriarchal authority and white male privilege in the first epi- graph above." Significantly, Lucero's poetic practice fluctuates between a prob- lematically essentialist yet symbolically empowering model of identity reminiscent of gynocritical theories of identity contemporaneous with her im- prisonment in the 1970s and 1980s, even as she explores structuralist models of subjectivity grounded in the economic base." Through her syncretic gynocrit- ical and materialist poems from prison, Lucero both recuperates and privileges her status as a daughter, a mother of a daughter, and ultimately a historically situated Chicana. As such, she uses the women's penitentiary as both a metaphorical and a real point of departure to propose a celebratory yet mate- rially grounded model of an insurgent subaltern Chicana identity that adum- brates subsequent generations of Chicana feminist artists, theorists, and ac- tivists. CONVICT MOTHER GODDESS Of Deities and Devils Lucero's gynocritical dismantling of the Foucauldian guard tower is fore- grounded in her first collection of poetry, published in 1973 in the Chicano cul- tural nationalist journal De Colores.13 This challenge necessarily begins with an interrogation of the legal and ontological effacement her incarceration simul- Olguin: Lucero's Gynocritical Prison Poetics and Materialist Chicana Politics 65</page><page sequence="4">taneously represents and reproduces. Like many prisoner writers, Lucero un- derscores this erasure by signing her poems with her prison identification number "21918" rather than her real name. In direct defiance to the patriarchal power imprinted throughout her life experiences and for which the peniten- tiary guard tower now serves as a metonym, she contests the effacing prison regimen that objectified her as a number and separated her from her daughter. Rather, she proclaims herself and her daughter as inseparable, ennobled, and manifestly divine precisely because of her incarceration, and, in doing so, she eventually recasts herself as a Convict Mother Goddess. But in order for Lucero to effect the beatification of her poetic persona - prisoner #21918 - she must first rhetorically establish a divine space to later oc- cupy. "Face of Fear," the first poem in Lucero's inaugural collection, reads as a symbolic enactment of this utopian desire. In this poem, prisoner #21918 in- troduces the Judeo-Christian God of her youth while simultaneously displac- ing it by an even more powerful deity - the Penitentiary. This displacement (which allows for the even more important dislocation to come), is facilitated through a rhymed free-verse gloss of a Psalm that establishes the divine space of authority through religious symbol and form. The poem opens: Stay with me ... God. ... The night is dark The night is cold; My little spark of courage dies. The night is long Be with me, God, and make me strong. (lines 1- 4, ellipses in original)14 By assuming the voice of a young schoolgirl in prayer, prisoner #21918 mod- els the total subordination that her truncated signature represents. On the sur- face, prisoner #21918 appears to be the passive subordinate of the panoptic tower, which she later describes as the "God of Strength and Gentleness" in a gloss of Foucault's description of the cruelly efficient panopticon that she will later undermine.15 Here, however, the deceptively innocent tone of prisoner #21918's childlike plea takes on a pathetic resonance as her desperation be- comes the somber, resigned whimper of a faithful Christian who has "fought the good fight," but lost. The poem continues in various past tenses: I knew what we were fighting for. Some peace for the kids, Our brothers' freedom, A kinder world, A cleansing mind. (5-7, emphasis mine) The fight is apparently over, everything seems lost: the kids' future, and 66 FRONTIERS/2001/VOL.XXII, NO. 2</page><page sequence="5">hers; a sibling's freedom, and everyone's; a world without violence that she has never known; an ontological resolution free from the confusion arising from her drug addictions. As the dramatic dialogue progresses, it devolves from a prayer into an ominous premonition, with "the haggard Face of Fear" staring her down just a few lines below, heralding Lucero's inevitable and humiliating death in prison as an anonymous number. But she resists. Faced with the ever-present specter of death in prison, Lucero symbolically recasts the significance of her legally sanctioned bondage and exploitation by resituating it within the Christian redemption myth. Amid the apparent vortex of existential despair expressed in the first lines of "Face of Fear," prisoner #21918 foregrounds a subversive blasphemy against her old Judeo-Christian God that clears the divine space of authority for the series of new deities to come. Midway through this one-stanza poem, she writes: I'm but the one my mother bore A simple person and nothing, nothing more. But ... God of Strength and Gentleness, Be pleased to make me nothing less ... (7-11, ellipses in original, emphasis mine) In a feigned humility that serves as the nucleus of her later beatification, prisoner #21918 asks little more than what her mother - not Jehovah - gave her: her very life. However, before Lucero is able to invoke this liberating matriarchal bond to facilitate her lyrical metamorphosis from prisoner #21918 into the Christ-like daughter of a mother and then the prototypical Mother God herself, Lucero must first accentuate her immediate material bondage and suffering. Thus, at this moment in her antilyrical passion play, her eventual claim to matriarchal authority and divinity initially functions as a prayer-like plea for the courage and strength to endure her day-to-day execution as an anonymous number. As such, this strophe forms the axis around which the old Judeo-Christian Deity initially is displaced by the new one - the Penitentiary - the secular God of the lumpenproletariat. In this preliminary dislocation, facilitated through prayer, the "God of Strength and Gentleness" assumes a dual significance. First, the trope refers to the "God of Light" of Judeo-Christian myth (as in, "Stay with me... God.... The night is dark"). Then, as this Being is proved to be impo- tent, and perhaps even malevolent for not intervening to end her ordeal, a new deity emerges to occupy the center. That is, prisoner #21918's prayer, initially offered to a celestial "God of Strength and Gentleness," is intercepted by the panoptic Penitentiary God, through its phallic palisade priest - the all-seeing guard tower - which claims the symbolic power of an erect phallus. This mor- Olguin: Lucero's Gynocritical Prison Poetics and Materialist Chicana Politics 67</page><page sequence="6">bid scenario, foregrounded in the very title of the poem, "Face of Fear," is un- derscored in the final four lines, which propose the consummate subordina- tion of the prisoner who tries to speak from beneath the frightening and dis- empowering gaze of the tower. She writes: Help me, 0 God, when Death is near, to Mock the haggard Face of Fear. Then when I fall, my soul may Triumph in the Dust .... (12-15, ellipsis in original) The composition, which begins as an homage to a Christian God with as- sumed powers, thus ends as a pathetic paean to a real Penitentiary God, whose power over life and death, and the prisoner's space in-between, is confirmed by the captive soul's abortive flight after its eventual release from the soon-to-be dead body of a convict(ed) woman, which can only "Triumph" in the "Dust." At this moment in Lucero's antilyric representations of her experiences as pris- oner #21918, only death offers an escape from the penetrating gaze of the con- crete, steel, and barbed wire Penitentiary God. Descent into the Abyss Perhaps anticipating her prison death, Lucero reclaims her subaltern subjec- tivity by successfully inscribing her own personal experience of incarceration within the descent motif of Christian myth as well as within materialist cri- tiques of the political economy of the prison. For instance, in the succeeding untitled poem that begins "Heartache's story here is told," prisoner #21918 rep- resents herself as a martyr condemned to a daily death in a "Dark and Silent and Cold" prison tomb. However, this four-stanza composition, which dra- matically ends with a single strophe description of prisoner #21918 as "This shell that once was a Woman," ultimately serves to link Lucero's metaphysical meditations on her imprisonment to a burgeoning materialist explication of the inner workings of this secular god in other poems. Similar to the appro- priative paradigm of other ethnic minority prisoner writers, whom H. Bruce Franklin notes are "forced, for their very survival, to become artists" in order to reconfigure the penitentiary as a site for counterhegemonic knowledge and agency, Lucero performatively underscores her multiple forms of alienation in order to indict and ultimately appropriate the prison regime of truth that is ob- fuscated by sanitized nomenclature (for example, "U.S. Department of Justice" and "Department of Corrections").i6 Still glossing the morbid nursery rhyme scheme of her previous poems, the rhythm of the poem "Jail-Life Walk" also 68 FRONTIERS/2001/VOL.XXII, NO. 2</page><page sequence="7">mimics the sounds of a complex factory machine efficiently and malevolently producing its product. The poem opens: Walk in the day... Walk in the night Count off the time ... One to Ten Then you'll be free... Free again. (1-3, ellipses in original)'7 The silent, ordered shuffle of prisoners walking from dinner back to their cell, from work detail to their cell, and from recreation back to their cell again, conjures up the image of an almost surreal purgatory where one's sentence is silence, and the key to survival is passive conformity. By complying with the litany of dehumanizing penitentiary routines, for which the trope "walk" serves as a metonym, prisoner #21918 seeks the momentary catharsis that con- formity offers (for example, "Walk... / Then you'll be free ... Free again"). But here, "freedom" refers more to the protection from the punishment meted out to nonconformists rather than to an actual release from prison, which Lucero achieves only through death. Moreover, the "freedom" encoded in the juridi- cal vernacular "to walk" (as in to be released from bondage regardless of a con- viction) is not only parodied, but is also identified as absolutely inaccessible for this Chicana prisoner. In fact, the "peace" that prisoner #21918's compliance "earns" her actually serves to animate the power of the penitentiary, which constantly informs the prisoner that she must be silent, that she must conform, walk in line, one, two, three.... In this figurative illustration of the alienating and domesticating function of the penitentiary, prisoner #21918's internalized jailer speaks to her with more force as the panoptic gaze of the guard tower is complemented by delineated rules stenciled on signs strategically placed throughout the labyrinthine corri- dors of the penitentiary. This ideological function of the women's prison, Adrian Howe and Juanita Diaz-Cotto note, is further actualized by socially symbolic prison rituals such as the use of color-coded uniforms (usually white, pink, or red), rigidly enforced speech codes that prohibit "unladylike" words (including cursing), and a domesticating regimen of forced labor in prison jobs such as sewing, laundry, cooking, and cleaning.'8 Within this patriarchal network of rules and routines designed to rehouse the "fallen woman" convict, prison itself becomes part of Lucero's poetry as she writes: Walk til you see ..... See the sign Look at the sign ..... Walk in Line! (5-6, ellipses in original) Olguin: Lucero's Gynocritical Prison Poetics and Materialist Chicana Politics 69</page><page sequence="8">The signs are everywhere. Furthermore, these signs, which assume the func- tion of an additional set of "eyes," cue the Penitentiary God's disciples - "In- mates" - to replicate its malevolent production of numbered beings. As R. Theodore Davidson has observed in his research on Chicano prisoner culture, those prisoners who conform to these subordinate roles earn the epithet "In- mate," the official prison administration term for prisoners, while those who resist assume the vernacular accolade "Convict," which signals their defiant re- fusal to passively or complicitously accept their subordination.19 Within this tension, "Jail-Life Walk" continues: Then walk in hate Walk without the world Walk in fear ... See the anger In their eye Just walking by ... (7-12, ellipses in original) Explicating firsthand the mechanics of panopticism, Lucero shows that the penitentiary factory becomes a paradigm of efficiency as the Inmates them- selves participate as principal agents in both the destruction of their civic sub- jectivities and the simultaneous production of their abject identities. This efficient interpellation of contained subjects is imbricated with the profit mo- tive legitimated in Article 13, Section i of the U.S. Constitution, the purported "Abolition Amendment" of 1865 that permits legal servitude "as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted."2' As Lucero illus- trates in her poetry from prison, she and the other prisoners are all legal slaves of the state compelled to walk, work, and produce profit, thus facilitating their own interpolation into Inmates and their simultaneous estrangement from their "free world" subjectivities. However, Lucero's performative explication of the symbolic and political economy of imprisonment, where prisoners are reduced to acting like animal- istic predators preying on and disciplining each other, inevitably exposes the slippage in the prison's discursive constitution. In the last stanza of "Jail-Life Walk," for example, she exposes the inaccessibility of the juridical trope "free- dom," which proposes "rehabilitation through time served." She writes: The only thing free is your mind Free to count As U walk in Line (13-16) 70 FRONTIERS/2001/VOL.XXII, NO. 2</page><page sequence="9">Marta E. Sinchez aptly underscores the significance of this paradox when she notes: The poem ... demonstrates that her fight to assert freedom is inseparably bound to her material condition. Her mind is free to mark the count of the jail walk. With each count her "free" mind acknowledges her physical im- prisonment. The dialectic of the poem is knowing that her freedom lies in knowing she is not free.2' Ironically, by representing and explicating her alienation in prison, prisoner #21918 recognizes her unique status as a "fallen," or rather convict(ed) woman: She is fundamental to the maintenance of the penitentiary order and the profit-driven Prison Industrial Complex regime that requires her exclusion from the polis. That is, her existence is both intolerable and necessary - and she knows this. Convict Mother Goddess While Lucero's alter ego, prisoner #21918, is forced to facilitate her own alien- ation by "walking," Lucero's deliberate and damning representation of her sta- tus as a convict(ed) woman ultimately enables her to appropriate another penological trope - the sentence - to rewrite the defeatist paradigm Foucault articulates when he suggests in his discussion of panopticism that counter- power is always already co-opted by power, especially in prison.2 Having first displaced the Christian God who has betrayed her, then disrupted the vacuous moral allegory of "reform" promulgated by the apocryphal Penitentiary God, Lucero's metaphysical and materialist signifying practices climax together in other poems such as "A Little Girl's Prayer" and "Christmas Sacrifice."23 Lucero extends the family/kinship network that Diaz-Cotto observed in other women's prisons in the United States, "in which Latina (and non-Latina) pris- oners supported one another [by adopting] the roles of husband, wife, mother, father, sister, brother, etc."24 Indeed, these poems, which appear as the second and penultimate compositions in Lucero's first collection of poetry respec- tively, can be read as complementary compositions in Lucero's gynocritical and materialist recuperation, reconstruction, and celebration of her subaltern subjectivity as a Convict, a mother and, above all else, a Convict Mother God- dess - the ultimate Matriarch. In sharp contrast to the subservient, infantilized persona Lucero assumes in earlier compositions, such as in "Face of Fear" as prisoner #21918, Convict #21918 now assumes the role of omniscient narrator in order to complete the Christian allegory of descent invoked earlier by pairing it with the related res- urrection topos. In "A Little Girl's Prayer," for instance, Lucero introduces her unique fairy tale with the standard expository phrase, "That night in a Prison Olguin: Lucero's Gynocritical Prison Poetics and Materialist Chicana Politics 71</page><page sequence="10">far away" (line lo). However, her appropriation of a cultural form that tradi- tionally functions to prevent the emergence of the "fallen woman" (or to re- house her after she "falls") involves a profound transformation of the fairy tale. In Lucero's version, the Convict narrator recounts how a daughter's prayer - "'Please God, send my Mommy home on Christmas day.. ."' - is ultimately articulated onto the mother's simultaneous entreaty in the last two stanzas of the poem - "Please God ... watch over my Little Girl .. ." (lines 4, 14). These corresponding appeals form a new bond that transcends the bondage imposed by the walls of the women's penitentiary. Lucero, the narrator, is thus able to link mother and child despite the tower's penetrating and prohibitive gaze. As such, Lucero herself assumes the archetypal role of storyteller, a role that T. Minh-ha Trinh locates within a problematically essentialist but nonetheless ennobling model of matriarchy she posits as transhistorical and central to hu- man history.25 In telling this fairy tale from and about her prison hell, Lucero, through Inmate-cum-Convict #21918, lays claim to the authorial space that previously had been occupied by the masculinist gods charged with rehousing and deconstructing her into a profit-producing Inmate. The narrative in "A Little Girl's Prayer" thus finally dislocates the apocryphal gods foregrounded in "Face of Fear" - the Judeo-Christian Deity, Jehovah, and the secular god of the lumpenproletariat, the Penitentiary - both of whom have usurped a cultural feminist model of "Woman's space." In the complementary poem "Christmas Sacrifice," Convict #21918 more conclusively storms the phallic palisades of the penitentiary guard tower, her real-world nemesis. What began as a subliminal form of blasphemy and em- powerment in earlier poems such as "Face of Fear" ("I'm but the one my mother bore... / Be pleased to make me nothing less") becomes a deliberate and spir- itually empowering affirmation of herself as a woman, a mother, and a story- teller: that is, a creator and the Creator. In this poem, Lucero foregrounds this metamorphosis of her alter ego by writing, "But only time I guess will tell / if it was all worth this time in HELL" (11-12). She then concludes this apocalyptic strophe with the climactic tragedy that lifts her from the phoenix's ashes, cata- pulting her - and her daughter - into the heights of divinity: But even tho I can't help remember That God's son died to make things better, and So also I know, that I must pay No, sacrifice my Christmas day - my daughter's gone. (17-20) The prayer motif, coupled with the Christmas setting where Christians cel- ebrate their Messiah's birth, here serves to catalyze the ultimate synthesis of her 72 FRONTIERS/2001/VOL.XXII, NO. 2</page><page sequence="11">abject subjectivities and experiences. The legend of Jehovah and His holy child Christ, who descended into the abyss to rise again more ennobled, is paired with the experiences of the convict(ed) mother, Judy Lucero, and her only sur- viving daughter, a de facto prison orphan. In this secular scenario, Convict #21918, who previously assumed the nobility of Christ through her own de- scent and penance in "Jail-Life Walk," is now canonized through the sacrifice, albeit an unwilling one, of her own daughter. In the process, Lucero's absent daughter now assumes the role of the holy offspring given up for the salvation of all. In this epiphanic crescendo of role reversals, Convict #21918 transforms herself into the archetypal Mother Goddess and Mother of Goddess - a Con- vict Virgin of Guadalupe - and her daughter becomes the new archetypal Vic- tim/Savior - a female Christ.26 Lucero thus symbolically transforms the lower- case "i" presented in the first stanza of "Christmas Sacrifice" (for example, "I sometimes ask myself, 'just who am i?"'), into the deified uppercase "I" that appears toward the end of this poem and in others to follow. SECULAR SAINT OF AZTLaN Toward a Matriarchal Pantheism Whereas Lucero's first collection of poetry focuses on the battle for control of the penal space of authority (which is alternately occupied by Jehovah, Prison, and finally by the Convict Mother and Daughter Goddesses), her second col- lection of poetry, "Ocho poemas de amor y desesperaci6n" ("Eight Poems of Love and Desperation"), published in the 1976 special issue of De Colores ded- icated to Los Pintos de America (the Chicana and Chicano Prisoners of Amer- ica), is distinguished by a pantheistic lexicon far removed from the harsh con- crete reality of the women's penitentiary.27 Here, Lucero's vocabulary now invokes trees, leaves, rivers, wind, sky, and the seasons of the year. In so doing, Lucero emphasizes the epic dimensions of Convict #21918's epistemological and material battle to deconstruct the "fallen woman" paradigm that has led to her multiple abjections: Since the spectacle could be occurring anywhere, it potentially is everywhere. Anticipating similarly syncretic gynocritical and ma- terialist feminist discourses by Alma Villanueva, Lorna Dee Cervantes, and Gloria Anzaldfia, among others, Lucero's nuanced gendering of this ambigu- ously situated geopoetic space ultimately enables a matriarchal pantheism that proposes to dissolve the imprisoning binary paradigm promulgated by Patri- archy/Prison: She recenters the status of women on earth as Convict #21918 previously had done in the heavens.'2 That is, in "Ocho poemas de amor," Lucero's earlier theme of estrangement is reconfigured in terms of Convict #21918's relationship to Mother Earth. Whereas Human Rights Watch recently Olguin: Lucero's Gynocritical Prison Poetics and Materialist Chicana Politics 73</page><page sequence="12">denounced the legacy in women's prisons in which male guards oftentimes "provided unobtainable goods and services to the [women] prisoners in ex- change for various forms of sexual intercourse or sexual touching," Lucero re- deploys the female body through a verse that now more overtly emphasizes the cyclical, regenerative qualities of nature's and women's life cycles.29 Echoing her previous modus operandi, Part I of this eight-part poem opens with the dichotomy she will later dissolve. She writes: If I could conquer the wind I'd send my love on a breeze. But The devil sends a black night - My heart drops like Autumn leaves. (I, 1- 4)3" The conditional clause of the opening strophe ("If I could conquer the wind") underscores the idea that Lucero, as Convict #21918, is still estranged from her "species being," which in this case is embodied by her absent lover - perhaps her daughter, another woman, maybe a man, or someone else alto- gether. At this moment, we cannot know for sure with whom or with what she desires communion because Convict #21918's yearning is thwarted by "the devil," who has now replaced (or unmasked) the Penitentiary God. Like her ef- forts to rearticulate herself with "U" the free-world reader in another desper- ate poem titled "I Speak in an Illusion," this attempted reunion is thwarted by her nemesis's "black night." Invoking both the desperation and fatalism ex- pressed in earlier poems such as "Face of Fear" - which is also set in a "dark," "cold," and long "night" and from which death seems to be her only form of escape ("Then when I fall, my soul may Triumph in the / Dust. .. .") - Convict #21918 again anticipates her eventual release from, and triumph over, her im- prisonment only in terms of death. This part of the poem, for instance, ends with the image of Autumn, the season when trees lose their foliage in prepara- tion for winter ("My heart drops like Autumn leaves"). As in her first collection of poetry, however, Lucero's existentialist despair has a liminal and transformative resonance. In "Ocho poemas de amor," the transformative potential of Lucero's verse revolves around her new meteoro- logical symbolic system. That is, by invoking the syntax of the Romantic tradi- tion in which nature sometimes assumes anthropomorphic traits and human- ity and its creations' pantheistic qualities, Lucero foregrounds her next synthesis of the celestial Convict Mother (of) Goddess adumbrated in her first installment. In Part II, the Convict Mother (of) Goddess becomes the terres- trial Goddess, Mother Earth, upon whose back the devilish patriarchal Prison illegitimately perches. She writes: 74 FRONTIERS/2001/VOL.XXII, NO. 2</page><page sequence="13">If you will give your strength to me We'll conquer all these things. We'll ride the wind, walk hand in hand Forever, like in Spring! (II, 1- 4)3" The image of Autumn's colorful dead - which must lay fallow for an entire season, Winter/Prison, before the brittle ashes of fallen leaves can renew the immortal Spring/Freedom - underwrites a new allegory. Still imprisoned, the Convict #21918 offers a collectivist resolution to the conditional clause ("If you will give your strength to me / We'll conquer all these things"). That is, through the "strength" of collective acts of resistance and transgression called for here and in previously discussed poems such as "Christmas Sacrifice," Convict #21918 confirms that the devil and his powerful wind can be conquered and transformed into the type of fertile liminal moment foregrounded by Autumn, in which death enables life, and the end introduces a new beginning. The relo- cation of the phoenix motif (initially presented in her first installment of po- etry in terms of the Judeo-Christian resurrection myth) onto this meteorolog- ical space thus facilitates her most important synthesis yet. She proposes that the process of subordination and resistance, which many male Convict writers oftentimes represent as violently dialectical, ultimately is a cyclical phenome- non that can be understood in terms of "mother nature" and the female body: Winter is always followed by Spring; bleeding by (re)birth.32 Moreover, Lucero suggests that her own resistance to the women's penitentiary and other repres- sive and ideological state apparatuses that threaten everyone's freedom must be a cooperative and collective process throughout: With our help, Convict #21918's prison hell will soon end, and, with her help, so will ours. Lucero's previous explications of bondage and alienation as well as her des- perate though confident struggle to rearticulate (with our help) Inmate #21918 into Convict #21918 - Woman, Mother (of) Goddess, and ultimately Mother Earth - is further consummated through the more overtly female-centered sig- nifying practices that distinguish subsequent parts of "Ocho poemas de amor." That is, she relocates her symbolic challenges to Patriarchy/Prison onto a more palpable and real terrestrial battleground. Part IV, for example, begins with a "mountain" performing the oppression previously attributed to the phallic penitentiary guard tower and thus foregrounds yet another synthesis of Lucero's counterhegemonic subjectivity. Still glossing the nursery-rhyme scheme introduced earlier, she writes: Down in the deep dark valley The river runs muddy and dry Olguin: Lucero's Gynocritical Prison Poetics and Materialist Chicana Politics 75</page><page sequence="14">The river's in love with the mountain But the mountain loves only the sky The river she weeps so sadly Because she feels so alone She begs the mountain to love her But it sits like a throne (IV, 1-8, emphasis mine)33 As inferred in Lucero's previous explications of the women's penitentiary, the phallic guard tower and its effaced and dehumanized subordinate ob- servee, the Inmate, are now more overtly gendered: The former is now a "mountain" that protrudes into the sky unhindered, immaculate "like a big pretty throne," while the latter is represented by the symbol of the "river," whose potentially powerful and regenerative flow is rendered into a trickle, a muddy weep. Here, the mountain's wanton penetrations into the heavens have resulted in a disharmony between it and the "river," which occupies the sub- ordinate/prisoner space in the "deep dark valley" below. Like Inmate #21918 in earlier poems, whose alienation is underscored by the succeeding litany "Who am i?" the river is virtually dried up, dead. Despite its morbid tone, however, this allegorical linkage of the prisoner with a distinctly gendered geopolitical space - battlefield earth - enables Con- vict #21918 to expand the celestial Mother (of) Goddess model of identity pre- sented in her first collection by linking the Mother (of) Goddess to a terres- trial matriarch able to synthesize the binary oppositions that initially necessitated Lucero's utopian construction. The prisoner-cum-river's trans- formation into Mother Earth is consolidated in the third and fourth strophes of Part IV, where Lucero rhetorically asks: Who am I? Who am I? Still it sits like a big pretty throne The tears that I shed for the river The flowers just grow and grow (IV, 9-12) Similar to Trinh's linkage of lyric storytelling with a mother's creative ca- pacity, Convict #21918's poetry from prison also claims a regenerative power. Her verses, which heretofore have resonated with a sense of profound desper- ation ("These tears that I shed for the river"), now flow with a menstrual reg- ularity that creates life ("the flowers just grow and grow"). 76 FRONTIERS/2001/VOL.XXII, NO. 2</page><page sequence="15">As the poem progresses, the morbid tone that distinguishes Lucero's corpus throughout climaxes in an apocalyptic but pantheistic orgy of creation, a birthing ritual that simultaneously serves as a metacritical explication of her ars poetica as an ars politica. She continues: Someday, the mountain will crumble And the sky will shed tears So the mountain will reach the river And the bondage they feel will show Who am I? Who am I? And their bondage will show I know (15-20, emphasis mine) The deified Convict's tears fall from their celestial perch engulfing every- thing on earth in a nurturing moisture. Moreover, the once imposing moun- tain is washed away into the now powerful flow of the river, enabling an onto- logical resolution to the recurrent existential inquiry "Who am I?" Precisely because of her tears - her poems from prison - Lucero, through Convict #21918, confirms her regenerative potential as the Convict Mother (of) God- dess, who is also Mother Earth, the giver and guardian of all life. Thus, in "Ocho poemas," Lucero affirms - as if she were speaking from a position of power and authority - that, as sure as she writes, women's apocalyptic con- frontations with Patriarchy/Prison/Devil/Death will be followed by a revolu- tionary rebirth in which old structures and paradigms give way to new ones adumbrated by women's embodied knowledge and agency. This last symbolic synthesis of her identity as the celestial Mother (of) Goddess and the terres- trial Mother Earth brings Lucero even closer to the Chicana and Chicano com- munity from which she has been disarticulated and separated by a violently unjust juridical system and its extralegal counterparts. That is, she merges her gynocritical poetics with a materialist preoccupation that revolves around land, which is not solely a metaphor, but the very object of the struggle. REWRITING AND RECLAIMING AZTLAN In the eighth and final part of "Ocho poemas de amor y desesperaci6n," Lucero introduces the figure of un bohemio alone in a cantina, a working-class bar usually located in a Chicano neighborhood, or barrio. He is drinking and wallowing in his sadness after having been "betrayed" by an unnamed "lover" from whom he is now estranged. Despite the specificity of the bohemio's indi- Olguin: Lucero's Gynocritical Prison Poetics and Materialist Chicana Politics 77</page><page sequence="16">vidual circumstances, this scene nonetheless introduces Lucero's final and most significant spatial relocations: Through her invocation of both the theme and form of the corrido, the popular Mexican and Chicano folk ballad form that one often hears in the quintessentially male setting of a cantina, Lucero re- situates her gynocritical discourse onto the traditionally phallocentric space of the barrio, the heart of Aztlin, the Chicano cultural nationalist homeland.34 More precisely, Lucero figuratively revises and reclaims Aztlin by radically transforming the masculinist ethos of violence that undergirds the traditional epic heroic corrido, the genre that Jose E. Lim6n, Cordelia Candelaria, Ram6n Saldivar, and others have problematically proposed as the master narrative for an oppositional Chicana and Chicano literature.35 In contrast to the violent social bandit or bad-man hero wielding his phal- lic pistol in his hand celebrated by male corridistas (balladeers) and their (male) Chicano cultural nationalist proteges, Lucero presents a hero "ya sin fe" ("with no more faith") who, significantly, has resolved to passively drink away his sorrows. Lucero's hero - whose own story of suffering and loss resonates with Lucero's preceding verse treatment of her own tragic life - refuses to strike back and instead claims the symbolic moral high ground associated with his status as an aggravated underdog. Whereas Ratil Homero Villa celebrates the epic heroic corrido as the master narrative for an oppositional Pinto poetry, I submit that in this poem Lucero rejects the simple inversions of the violent bi- nary paradigm of power modeled by the corrido and, by extension, the deriv- ative cultural nationalist poetics of (male) Chicano convict poets that is replete with masculinist imagery and graphic threats of sexualized violence.36 Having been victimized by the violence that the corrido, its derivative forms, and the women's prison all represent in terms of an active versus passive binary, Lucero intervenes. Her performative transformation of the epic heroic corrido occurs in the second stanza of the poem, in which the third-person narrative is inter- rupted by the protagonist himself. The passage, complete with the ortho- graphic and syntax errors that mark the subaltern status of the poet and the working-class Chicano cultural context of the setting, reads as follows: Moso, sirvame la copa rota Sirveme que me destrosar Esta fierve de obsessi6n Moso, sirvame la copa rota Quiero sangrar gota y gota ... Bartender, serve me the broken glass 78 FRONTIERS /2001/VOL.XXII, NO. 2</page><page sequence="17">Serve me so that destroys for me This fever of obsession Bartender, serve me the broken glass I want to bleed drop by drop ... (VIII, 32-36, translation mine)37 Rather than simply signal the closure of the ballad, as a third-person narra- tive interruption sometimes serves to do in the traditional corrido, Lucero's self-reflexive protagonist's intervention is open-ended. Instead of having her hero rise up in violent acts of retribution as in the epic ballad she invokes, Lucero's bohemio languishes on his imprisoning bar stool lamenting and, significantly, embracing his "desgracia," or "misfortune." Lucero's tragic tale of the downtrodden bohemio thus becomes far more than simply a tragic love song. This poem functions as a heuristic device that extends the gynocritical allegory of the collapsing mountain in Poem IV of "Ocho poemas de amor." Here, Lucero is modeling the nonbinary exercise of power she calls for from her free-world readers to whom, and ultimately of whom, she sings. This poem also is a tale about telling tales; it is a metacritical ars poetica that proposes Lucero's didactic fairy tales from hell as interventions in and of themselves. As in Part VI of "Ocho poemas de amor," in which the narrator pledges to her never-identified lover to "write for you the story of our love / ... with the blood red ink / of the Heart ... ,38 the bohemio's conscious decision to drink from the broken glass, which he knows will tear his mouth into a bloody faucet, serves as the leitmotiv of Lucero's entire writing enter- prise: Fully aware of the horror and trauma she will revisit, Lucero, through Convict #21918, explicates in intimate detail the Penitentiary that has ripped her into a "shell that once was a Woman." Like the suffering bohemio in her poem, Lucero embraces, cultivates, and ultimately appropriates her abject sta- tus in prison (and her life before) in the hope of transforming her complex so- cial location into a symbolic and materially liberating liminal space, which she proposes to rewrite with her regenerative woman-centered cultural nationalist verse. To this end, Lucero's gynocritical and materialist imperatives further con- verge with the populist poetics of the corrido in her last known poem, "Hu- milidad" [sic], published posthumously in 1980, seven years after her heart and brain literally exploded into her powerful "blood red ink."39 In this poem, written in the same vernacular style and lexicon as Part VIII of "Ocho Poe- mas," Lucero more conclusively locates her lyric appropriations onto the cul- tural nationalist terrain of Aztlin by specifically addressing her poem to the Olguin: Lucero's Gynocritical Prison Poetics and Materialist Chicana Politics 79</page><page sequence="18">culturally specific referent "mi RAZA," which roughly translates as "my PEOPLE" even as it still resonates with the false cognate "my RACE." Loosely modeling the octosyllabic quatrains of the corrido form, she writes: A mi RAZA aqui les cuento Y los quero dejar saber Como pobres seremos para siempre Y sin nadie que los platique porque. To my PEOPLE I tell you here and now And I want to let you know Poor we are and always will be And with no one to explain to you why. (lines 1- 4, translation mine)40 Although the octosyllabic meter and "a-b-c-b" rhyme scheme of the stan- dard form of the corrido are not consistently preserved, the form of the "people's song" as sung by a bard-as-witness (and sometimes participant) is immediately invoked from this first stanza, which functions like the corrido's declamatory invocation. The references to poverty and anomie facilitate yet another figurative displacement in which Lucero's new protagonist, "mi RAZA," implicitly is imbedded with several of her previous picaresque heroes: a Chicana mother forcibly separated from her daughter, a dried-up river, and even "un bohemio borracho." More importantly, the possessive pronoun "mi," or "my," here serves to rearticulate Convict #21918 back onto her Raza. Her concurrent use of the third person plural ("nosotros") conjugations of verbs "to be" (for example, "seremos," or "we will be") and "to suffer" (for ex- ample, "hemos sufrido," or "we have suffered") further collapses the space be- tween her own suffering and her people's collective subordination. "We have suffered," she implies, "together." In direct contrast to the humility suggested by the title of this poem, Lucero claims the proud and even audacious license foregrounded in her very first composition, "Face of Fear," in which she pro- claims to be "nothing less" than "the one my mother bore." Here, Lucero om- nisciently proposes her historia as the historia of La Raza, and vice versa. Noth- ing more; nothing less. Her bold linkage and diachronic invocation of this cultural form, which apparently arose as a popular performance of resistance to Anglo-American colonial subjugation and the attendant capitalist mass- scale exploitation that ensued at the end of the Mexican-American War in 1848, enabled Lucero to historicize her incarceration as a continuation her people's colonial subordination. By merging her embodied poetics with the broader Chicano body politic, Lucero is articulating the type of women-centered "re- 80 FRONTIERS/2001/VOL.XXII, NO. 2</page><page sequence="19">sistance literature" that Barbara Harlow links to other distinctly embodied subversive practices such as work stoppages, hunger strikes, and even "no- wash" protests, in which women prisoners in Northern Ireland refused to wash their menstrual fluid, urine, and excrement in order to repel their abu- sive male guards with their collective body odor. Lucero, in a figurative but no less visceral way, recenters her body in Aztlin.4' As the new epic bard of an Aztlin she previously reconfigured in terms of an innovative matriarchal pantheism in "Ocho poemas de amor," Lucero ulti- mately models a new insurgent subaltern Chicana subjectivity. By claiming the separate but central role as bard-as-witness-participant, Lucero rejects a sim- plistic and immanently conservative Marianist model of womanhood in favor of a newly empowered speaking subject - Malintzin - whom Norma Alarc6n has proposed as a foundational multilingual archetype for a counterhege- monic subaltern Chicana subjectivity.42 This new Chicana "translator" takes the form of a Pinta, a politicized Chicana prisoner who functions as a Chicana permutation of the counterhegemonic subject enunciated by the vernacular prison moniker "Convict" discussed above. As I have shown elsewhere, "Pinto," as well as the corresponding feminine conjugation, "Pinta," function as a "bilingual play on penitencia (penitentiary), as well as the Chicano collo- quial past participle pintao (as in estar pintado), which means to be painted, tainted, or otherwise marked (as by skin pigmentation or a courtroom con- viction)."43 For Lucero, as for other Pintas and Pintos, her conviction and in- carceration enable a filiation with her community; their collective abjection is their mark of distinction and, more importantly, the basis of a collectivist and immanently counterhegemonic theory of praxis. It is from the depths of her prison hell that she is closest to her people; and it is also from here that she and they together are best able to reclaim Aztlin and the entire world. In her last published poem, Lucero's Convict Mother (of) Goddess thus re- turns to earth, not so much as Quetzalcoatl, but as a deified Malintzin who is translating a new story of liberation.44 In the last stanza of"Humilidad," for in- stance, Lucero further undermines the feigned humility alluded to by the title of the poem by offering a prophetic utopian resolution of her own and her people's collective suffering. She writes: Los errores que pasan por la Vida Todo esto algin dia va 'cambiar Tengan Fe mis Hermanos, no se fijen, Por eso estos Versos se los quero Dedicar!!! The defeats that occur in Life All of this will one day change Olguin: Lucero's Gynocritical Prison Poetics and Materialist Chicana Politics 81</page><page sequence="20">Have Faith my Brothers, don't worry, This is why these Verses I Dedicate to you!!! (17-20, translation mine)45 As in the traditional corrido she glosses, Lucero's closing stanza signals the end of her open-ended verse performance by emphasizing the continuation of the struggle it recounts ("All of this will one day change / Have Faith my Broth- ers .. ."). The bohemio "ya sin fe" introduced in her previous collection, along with his symbolic brethren, La Raza, are now implored by the Pinta Poet to stand firm in their convictions that they are not only the downtrodden poor, but also the defiant underdogs who are destined to transform their defeats into a far-ranging liberation, provided, of course, that they refuse to simply invert a binary model of power. Anticipating Gloria Anzalduia by more than a decade, Lucero proclaims the birth of a new mestiza heroine invested with the nonbi- nary epistemology that distinguishes the gynocritical and materialist mestiza consciousness described in Anzalddia aforementioned testimonio, which is ex- cerpted as the second epigraph above. Lucero's contestatory verse thus no longer languishes in despair or simply heralds death; rather, it proclaims an ontological resolution and communion with her "RAZA," which, significantly, is written in all capital letters. She further models this utopian desire by sign- ing her last poem from prison with her full name - Judy A. Lucero. With her final signature, Lucero's poems from prison thus negotiate and ex- ploit the dialectical tensions that undergird her sentence and institutional era- sure. She canonizes herself. That is, even though she dies in prison - a fact that can never be glossed over by celebratory readings of her verse - Lucero nonetheless foregrounds the "resistance and affirmation" topos so crucial to paradigms of Chicana and Chicano culture, art, and identity that will distin- guish subsequent generations of cultural workers. Indeed, her very institu- tionalization, along with her critical engagement of her erasure, inevitably sit- uate, or rather canonize, her within the genealogy of modern Chicana feminist poets that includes such figures as Alma Villanueva, Lorna Dee Cervantes, Sandra Cisneros, and Gloria Anzaldtia, among others. Like these poets, Judy A. Lucero not only reclaimed the right to name and rename herself, but she also reclaimed the power to name and rename her world.
