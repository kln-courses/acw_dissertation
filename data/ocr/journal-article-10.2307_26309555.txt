Stone Department of Art History, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, P.O. Box 413, Milwaukee, Wl S320I, USA Abstract This paper discusses the importance of female breasts in gender construction in Maya art and explains artistic conventions and choices in their deployment. The visual analysis focuses on Late Classic pictorial vases and ceramic figurines. Rather than reflecting a natural body, the female breast was filtered through a cultural lens that drove its highly conceptual rendering in Maya art, mirrored in a breast hieroglyph. Through the principle of contrast, including morphology and absence vs. presence of breasts in specific pictorial contexts, Maya artists constructed female personae varying in age, class, supernatural status, and gender ambiguity. In order to flesh out the layered meaning of the breast, the paper turns to ethnographic studies of modern Maya medicine concerning the hot-cold system. It is argued that ethnographic data on women's bodies in medical discourse shed light on how the breast served as an index of age-based female stereotypes. INTRODUCTION In the past two decades studies of the ancient Maya have been invi gorated by growing interest in the human body. The richness of the body as a hermeneutic, offering many potential approaches and insights, means that this emerging literature has taken divergent paths in the exploration of social, symbolic, and experiential issues surrounding Maya culture. Grounded in phenomenology, Rosemary Joyce (e.g., 2004, 2005) has been the leading theorist of ancient Maya embodiment, taking as her main themes: perform ance of subjective experience, citationality, and bodily inscription, ideas influenced by the feminist philosopher Judith Butler. For Joyce, the body has no intrinsic or "natural" meaning apart from its constitution through the body's actions, conceived as perform ances, such as habitual patterns of dressing. Stephen Houston and colleagues' 2006 monograph The Memory of Bones: Body, Being, and Experience among the Classic Maya, foreshadowed by "An Archaeology of the Senses" (Houston and Taube 2000), represents yet another milestone. Expanding in new directions, they engage physiological and sensory components of the body, while also amassing a wealth of linguistic and hieroglyphic data to help under stand it emically. More recently, Matthew Looper's (2009) book on Classic Maya dance is, appropriately, situated in a theorized view of the body, which he positions in a complex, interactive relationship with aesthetics and agency. Broadly viewed, this selective picture of the literature indicates that study of the body among the ancient Maya, while still very much in progress, has reached a stage where certain fundamental notions have been established. The body is recognized as mediatory—of action in the world, and between individual and society. Its fluctuating identities are under stood as historically contingent and constituted by actualized cul tural conceptions, these being subject to control by society and state. E-mail correspondence to: stone@uwm.edu This article veers in yet another direction by looking at cultural conceptions surrounding a particular body part, the female breast, with special interest in the history of its representation during the Late Classic period (ca. a.d. 550-850). As a study in iconography, attempting to identify pictorial conventions and their associative meanings, the approach taken here is in many ways at variance with trends in embodiment studies which explicitly reject a search for systematic codes or fixed meanings that could be construed as semiotic systems (Joyce 2005; Looper 2009:10). Joyce (2005: 145) prefers to view representations of the body as "records of stereotyped embodied performances that served as models, or.,.ci tational precedents for the embodied gestures of living people." However, this does not account for the fact that the construction of images is wed to an internal system of reference emphasizing, for instance, dyadic contrasts and other didactic devices, not necess arily in synch with historically contingent trends in popular culture (as in the case of archaisms) and perhaps never emulated as such. The construction of body imagery is often guided by principles fol lowing artistic convention different than the social construction of a living body. Scheper-Hughes and Lock (1987:18) note that "Symbolic and structural anthropologists have demonstrated the extent to which humans find the body 'good to think with.'" Certainly, the female breast is a case in point. It is among the oldest and most prolific sub jects of world art whose representation is highly variable, con structed according to specific tastes and ideals held by different societies at different times. Crosscultural assumptions about images of breasts—that they must have been deployed as erotic ornaments, fertility symbols, or objects of desire—therefore need to be questioned. Marilyn Yalom's (1997) A History of the Breast makes this clear in the framework of Western art where the breast was exploited for a variety of religious, political, erotic, and com mercial purposes. It is fascinating to see that even during the staunchest periods of Western naturalism, the breast continued to be shaped, formally and symbolically, by idiosyncratic cultural 167</page><page sequence="2">168 Stone conventions. Certainly, Maya artistic formulations of the breast, which are as complex as any, need to be added to the historical record. In ancient Maya art, breasts played an important role in con structing female personae and even contributed by their absence, in situations where they would be expected, to the construction of other gender categories. As will be discussed below, breast absence was strategically deployed in the Classic Maya pictorial system to blur gender categories. Making the Maya case more inter esting, the breast was treated in conceptual ways, comparable to symbols and hieroglyphs, an approach catalyzed by the interaction between pictorial imagery and hieroglyphic writing (Stone and Zender 2011). The encoding of the breast is especially evident on painted Late Classic pictorial ceramics, the most informative visual media for studying the breast in Maya art. In this paper selected details of painted ceramic vessels illustrate features of breast depiction; the reader can find them in full context and in color in roll-out photographs available in the Maya Vase Database by Justin Kerr (http://www.famsi.org/research/kerr/index.html), identified by the "Kerr number" provided here in the illustration captions. Some are also published in the six volumes of The Maya Vase Book (Kerr 1989-2000). In addition, this study con siders pictorial evidence from Late Classic ceramic figurines. Illustrated figurines are of the hand-modeled type with detached limbs and appliqué, from Jaina Island, Campeche, although Southern Lowland figurines, often cast in molds and less well defined, seem to follow similar patterns. Images of women with exposed breasts in Maya art are largely restricted to these as well as a few other portable media, such as carved shell. Women's breasts are, in general, never depicted in large-scale public art fea turing aristocratic women. More will be said about this variance later. My inspiration to write this paper came from reading Beth Cohen's (1997) article, "Divesting the Female Breast of Clothes in Classical Sculpture." Besides realizing that a study of female breasts was equally fertile ground in Maya art. it struck me that this issue is made more compelling when breasts are both covered and uncovered. In other words, not only is the exposed breast a meaningful expression but so is its "absence" when strategically hidden by clothing, as this puts into play a dyadic code of absence (clothed) vs. presence (naked). It can be inferred from Cohen's article that the ancient Greeks capitalized on the absence/presence contrast to construct non-normative images of women, made possible by the fact that adult women were never sup posed to show their breasts in public; therefore when one or both breasts were revealed in a work of art, the subject was understood as unusual in some manner (representing, for instance, a goddess, Amazon, or seduction victim). While operating in a different histori cal framework in which adult women regularly went bare-breasted, ancient Maya artists nevertheless exploited the absence /presence contrast of breast signification linked to specific thematic situations, as well as playing upon shape contrasts. In consort with other con textual details, these contrasts helped to define status categories per taining to women, such as gender, age, and class, which are intimately connected (Joyce 2005:141), as well as insinuating supernatural or mortal status. In the following pages, I will attempt to describe contrastive visual strategies and other basic fea tures of breast representation. As body parts go, female breasts have wide semantic latitude. This is partly because the breast itself is not static, transforming in a manner that mirrors women's life stages. Because the form of the breast changes in synch with certain biological processes, such as ageing and pregnancy, breast morphology serves as an index in the truest sense in that it suggests inferences about the female body by being tied to critical fluctuations. Getting at more subtle connotations of the breast in Maya art is, however, difficult when dealing with an ancient society with limited written records. In an attempt to recover more recondite allusions, I have turned to ethnographies dealing with medical discourse pertaining to the hot-cold syndrome, which can broaden our understanding of the breast as a cultural construct and communicative sign in Classic period Maya art. Through this material, I hope to show that even though male voyeurism played a role in breast display in Maya art, another, in my view, more dominant role, was to convey notions of power, competence, and social bonds associated with women, and this accounts for the remarkable variety of approaches to women's breasts in pictorial imagery. BREAST EXPOSURE AND SOCIAL REALITY AMONG THE ANCIENT MAYA It is important to keep in mind the ancient Maya's customs regard ing breast exposure. Unlike the ancient Greeks, it was acceptable for adult women to go bare-breasted; this they did by just wearing a skirt. It also seems that a loose-fitting top falling below the breasts was not considered improper (Figure 2b). However, the lower portions of outfits were kept lengthy, as there seem to have been taboos against revealing any part of the body usually covered by a skirt, the knees being the upper limit of hemlines. A similar sort of modesty can still be seen in the Maya highlands. In San Pedro La Laguna at Lake Atitlan, young girls cannot go without a skirt even when bathing (Paul 1974:293), while Hendrickson (1995:127, Note 10) recounts a story of Kaqchikel women embarrassed about exposing their lower legs even in front of other women. Perhaps because of similar restrictions, the breast and shoulder area were prime targets for displaying women's bare flesh in the pre-Hispanic period, as pictorial representations seem to indicate. Confirmation of female breast exposure as a routine practice is given by the sixteenth-century Spanish bishop, Diego de Landa (Tozzer 1941:126), who indicated that women went topless in central Yucatan, remarking on the fullness of their breasts as evi dence of their excellent nursing abilities. He added, oddly given the hot climate, that women did not do this in coastal regions but wrapped cloth around their chests; however, pre-Hispanic figurines of women from coastal Campeche and Quintana Roo point to the same practices as in central Yucatan. It is unimaginable that Maya women wore fewer clothes after the imposition of Christianity, and, despite Landa's assertion, going topless for comfort in daily activities was probably commonplace among women living in all parts of the hot lowlands (Proskouriakoff 1961:81). It may have been most typical in private, domestic settings (Houston et al. 2006:42), perhaps more so in commoner households, but was never theless seen by Landa in public venues. Indeed, Q'eqchi' women living in the muggy climate of southern Belize went bare-breasted in the twentieth century, as I personally witnessed. Given this, images of bare-breasted women in Classic Maya art should not auto matically be taken as risqué or seen ipso facto as unusual. It seems, however, that baring the female breast was not always appropriate according to social etiquette. Understanding how this related to class, age, and the formality of the occasion, is challen ging. While the primary evidence, ancient art, presents a selective</page><page sequence="3">Keeping Abreast of the Maya 169 picture of social reality, it suggests that women of highest rank were not inclined to present themselves this way, at least in public, nor was it a typical mode of dress in formal settings, and that breast-revealing clothing was more commonplace among lower class women, associated principally with married, domestic "hard working" women, especially old women whose domesticity is refer enced by upper body nudity. It is also possible that breast display among unmarried adult women had sexual overtones. The art does not reveal regional variation in female body exposure, as indi cated by Landa. Classic period ceramic figurines from highland Guatemala depict bare-breasted women, and if this is indicative of social reality, it suggests that oppressively hot weather was not the only motivating factor for this practice. BREAST EXPOSURE AND COSTUME IN MAYA ART Breast exposure is related to fashion, which shows a number of vari ations in Maya art. Standard women's fashion from the Classic period has been discussed by Taylor (1984, 1992). I will address clothing only in the broadest outlines with an eye toward how it did or did not facilitate breast display. The most modest outfits covered breasts as well as shoulders. The greatest body coverage was achieved by the huípil, a long sack-like dress stitched up the sides, usually worn over a skirt, only the lower border of which can be seen (Figure la and 3b). These long, intricately-woven Iwipils recall the sobrehuipil worn today in highland Guatemala, which comprise a woman's most costly formal attire (Hendrickson 1995:138; Mayén de Castellanos 1986). Women's bodies were also well covered by the quechquemitl, a kind of over blouse with rounded edges, left open on the sides, worn with a skirt; these are commonly seen on ceramic figurines (Figure lb). I might mention that the Nahuatl terms huípil and quechquemitl do not reflect emic categories of women's clothing for the ancient Maya. In fact, Scheie (1997:24—27) invokes the Yukatec term k'ub for the huípil, which she identifies with both the long tunic-like garment and shorter over-blouse. My use of huípil and quechque mitl is simply for conveniently discriminating the two garments. Less modest garments covered the torso, including the breasts, but left shoulders and upper chest bare. This typically consists of a single, long cloth wrapped under the arms, which Taylor (1984: 19; 1992) calls a "body wrap" or "sarong." While covering breasts, this garment sometimes provocatively exposed cleavage (Figure lc). Figurines of women with a suckling infant depict them wearing a sarong pulled down on one side to reveal a single breast (Scheie 1997:36-37), an apparent convention for nursing. Comparable to the sarong in terms of body coverage is a skirt worn with a separate cloth wrapped across the chest, or "chest sash" (Taylor (1984:19), presumably the garment referred to by Landa (Figure Id). The huípil and sarong (Figures la and lc) are the most common garments for women in Maya art of the Southern Lowlands, while the skirt-quechquemitl (Figure lb) enjoyed more popularity to the north; for instance this outfit is common on Jaina figurines from north coastal Campeche and is typical of Late Postclassic art of Yucatan, including the codices. Breasts were fully exposed when women wore only a skirt (Figures 2a and 10a). This mode of dress is practically exclusive to ceramic figurines and painted depictions of women on poly chrome ceramics, with a handful of exceptions occurring in monu mental or public art, all in unusual circumstances. These include the Late Preclassic San Bartolo murals which have several bare-breasted females (Saturno et al. 2005); however, it is important to note the Figure I.

Also unusual is a carved circu lar stone from Tonina showing a woman baring one breast (Houston et a). 2006:Figure 6.4). A painted stucco sculpture said to be from a building facade in Yucatan shows a bare-breasted woman wearing royal insignia (Figure 14c). Women's breasts could be exposed in ways other than just wearing a skirt. Jaina figurines depict women in huipils and quech quemitls with necklines so low-cut that they fall below the breasts (Figure 2b). The breasts are indicated by appliqué nipples stuck onto a generic modeled body; however, women wearing only a skirt have breasts modeled in their entirety (Figure 2a). At the extreme, some pottery scenes and figurines depict completely nude, adult women (e.g., Figure 9b and 9c). However, the figurines may originally have worn perishable costumes, and the painted scenes are again mythological or thematically exceptional, for instance involving violence against women (Houston et al. 2006: 207-209); they do not reflect quotidian practice, since it was taboo for women to expose much of the lower body.</page><page sequence="4">170 Stone Figure 2.

THE SCOOPED NECKLINE GARMENT AND FEMININE BEAUTY Figurines show women's garments with wide-cut necklines (Figure lb). There are correlates to this in painted ceramics where necklines are so wide that they expose shoulders and upper arms (Figure 3a). A narrower, albeit low-cut, neckline just reveals the upper chest (Figure 3b). On figurines the wide-necked quechquemitl is usually modeled with a clay slab, but the tighter scooped neckline, as I henceforth call the narrower version, is usually indicated with slip paint on figurines. There are, then, technical differences in the construction of these two styles of neckline. Garments which hide the breasts but still plunge at the neck are common female attire on painted ceramics and figurines (but are rare in monumental art) and confirm that slashing the neckline provided the best oppor tunity for revealing women's bare skin. Figure 3. Low-cut necklines on women's costumes: [a] Drooping huipil. Painted vase (after Kerr Archive No. K6316); (b) Scooped neckline huípil worn by Tikal woman. Note visible breast. Painted vase (after Kerr Archive No. K2573). Drawings by the author. The curving scooped neckline was such a conventional female costume design that it became codified and part of an arsenal of feminine traits sometimes used abstractly in Maya art. This neckline encoded the idea not just of "pretty" women, but also ones who command respect; they may be ladies of the court, respectable com moner women, or goddesses. In painted media these women are beautified using conventions of anatomy and hairstyle (e.g.. Figure 3b), and among figurines, women with scooped necklines are bejeweled and have intricate hairdos. In general the scooped neckline garment seems to encode feminine beauty associated with women in their youthful reproductive years, and by extension, female fertility, a concept conveyed by the trope of youthful beauty. Youthful feminization implied by the scooped-neckline garment is made clear in a rare example of an aristocratic woman dressed in this manner in monumental sculpture, seen on the eighth-century Lintel 26 from Yaxchilan (Figure 4). Here, Lady K'abal Xook, holding the shield and feline headdress of her husband, Itzamnaaj Balam II, wears a huípil with a plunging neckline that seems inten tionally daring, as Proskouriakoff (1961:87) long ago observed. The treatment of her head, which, like the breast, was targeted in con structing female stereotypes in Maya art, is feminized beyond the usual in monumental sculpture. Her head is not covered by an angular headdress but shows off the intricate twists of her hairdo, including forelock, a "small tuft of hair centered at the front of the head" (Robertson 1985:30), and ponytail, all of this alluding to her femininity. The forelock, though worn by males, as in this scene, nevertheless is a female diagnostic, codified as a dark fore head disk in the IXIK logograph introducing female names (see, for example, the glyphic caption in Figure 3b). The elongated, Figure 4. Aristocratic woman with feminized features, including twisted hairstyle and low-cut huípil. Yaxchilan, Lintel 26. Drawing by Ian Graham (Graham and Von Euw 1978). Reproduced courtesy of the President and Fellows of Harvard College.</page><page sequence="5">Keeping Abreast of the Maya 171 tapered head of Lady K'abal Xook is another feminine trait and in her hair are round, feathery ornaments. Lady K'abal Xook's femi nine beauty is so "textbook," in the treatment of the head, especially the curvilinear intricacy of her hairstyle and the exposure of the shoulder-chest area, that it must have contributed some crucial meaning (Joyce 2001:124-125). Displaying stereotypical female beauty, such as this, was a way of alluding to women's fertility. If this were the case in Lintel 26, also suggested by the toad design on her huípil, which among modern Tzotzil is associated with the earth and fertility (Morris 1985:76), it may bear on the military equipment she clutches (near her breast, by the way). For instance, she might be empowering these objects through her fertility or affirming women's support of the male culture of warfare, a practice suggested elsewhere in the visual record. Scheie noted (1997:19), for instance, that the Tablet of the Slaves and Palace Tablet from Palenque specifically show women holding a sacred war object in the form of the "flint-shield" glyphic expression for war, u lok' u pakal. Moreover, noblewomen wearing the scooped-neckline garment witness the bloody captive sacrifice in the aftermath of a battle, painted in Room 2, Bonampak; and Lady K'abal Xook's bloodletting on Yaxchilan Lintel 25 invokes a military figure with shield and spear. Doubtless, women's ritual affirmation of military ideology was important for the Classic Maya. This was clearly the case in later Aztec society where women and militaristic themes fre quently converge in ritual performance, exemplified by the feast of Ochpaniztli dedicated to Toci (Duran 1971:229-337). Is it significant that Lady K'abal Xook holds a shield and helmet? We might consider this in light of ethnographic accounts in the Maya area indicating that fertile women were believed to possess innate power that could affect things with which they came in contact. As will be discussed later, fertile women's proxi mity to male-gendered equipment was sometimes believed to have dire consequences for men and was avoided; however, in other situations female contact was sought by men, encouraging women's power to be transmitted through ritual acts. For instance, Guiteras-Holmes (1961:43) mentions that Tzotzil farmers ask their wives to step over or hold baskets containing maize grains used for planting or instead place their spinning equipment or objects of personal adornment (i.e., that have touched the woman's body) in such baskets. The Yaxchilan scene may likewise show something beneficial happening from female contact with male-gendered objects, suggesting that the ancient Maya also believed effects arose from a fertile woman touching male equip ment. This would explain the exceptionally feminized portrayal of Lady K'abal Xook on Lintel 26. It suggests something else: whereas Lady K'abal Xook appears to play a secondary role in the scene, a pretty ritual assistant to her husband, it may be that her feminine appearance references her power. Lady K'abal Xook does not look like this in Lintels 24 and 25, located in the same building (Structure 23), where her neck is smothered by a jade collar, her head, by an angular headdress, and the imagery conveys a more mystical side of her personality. In other words Lady K'abal Xook's feminine appearance on Lintel 26 does not subvert her authority and agency but rather points to one of its sources. In portable media, women's breasts can be seen despite the fact they are wearing clothes. On painted ceramics the breast contour and nipple are made visible through clothing (Figure 5a and 5b). In pottery figurines the garment clings to the woman's body revealing the breasts (Figure 5c). In painted versions, the garment usually has the diagnostic scoop neckline under discussion (Figure 5a and 5b). Figure 5. Breast visible while covered by clothing: (a) Painted vase (after Kerr Archive No. K2603); (b) Painted vase (after Kerr Archive No. K1I82); [c] Jaina figurine (after Kerr Archive No. K5779). Drawings by the author. Often the woman's arms can be seen through clothing as well; there fore, one might argue that this is a mere drawing convention—the artist sketched in the arms and breast and then added clothes over this. Another possibility is that the clothes are really see-through, some kind of gauze weave, perhaps. This may be the case for a strid ing woman painted in a recently discovered mural from Calakmul whose entire body outline is visible through her clothing; she may in fact be wearing a gauze weave dress. However, I believe most of the images in question are constructions of a young beauty using a pastiche of codes, one being the breasts, another being the scooped neckline, and others related to the treatment of the head: elongated, tapered, near bald pate (distantly recalling the hereditary frontal baldness of Yucatecan women [Redfield and Villa Rojas 1962 [1934]: 182]), intricate hairdo adorned with baubles, and narrow upswept eye. I now believe that, conceptually, the breasts are not seen through the clothes but that both breasts and clothing are simultaneously present, a kind of piling on of symbols that dis regards naturalism and is commonplace in Mesoamerican art. One pictorial vase shows a mythological scene that reveals the codified nature of these feminized elements and how they can be combined conceptually. The image is of a female standing waist deep in symbolically-represented water (Figure 6); in fact, her glyphic name means something like "Lady Water." Her youthful femininity is indicated by a series of signs. On the head are the— here exaggerated—forelock, bald pate, elongated head, and</page><page sequence="6">172 Stone Figure 6. Mythical scene of naked woman with stylized breasts and indi cation of scooped neckline associated with femininity. Painted vase. Drawing by the author (after Robicsek and Hales [l98l:Vessel 30]). upturned eyes. Her generic body outline is feminized by breasts and the scooped neckline. The latter is remarkable because the figure is intended to be topless, indicated by the lack of costume and com parison with related vase scenes featuring bare-breasted women standing in water (Robicsek and Hales 1981:Vessels 80-84). Nor do these curved lines delineate a necklace, which should consist of round beads and hug the neck tightly. Rather, this woman (Figure 6) is conceptually constructed using conventional signs. Even the breasts look glyph-like (see Figure 7). This is not surprising given that the female breast was hierogly phically encoded. Illustrated here are examples from Piedras Negras, Throne 1 (Houston et al. 2006:Figures 1-3) and Stela 14 (Christophe Helmke, personal communication 2008) (Figure 7a and 7b), and in pictorial ceramics, the so-called "Altar Vase" from Altar de Sacrificios (Marc Zender, personal communication 2008) (Figure 7c). Chu' is a broadly disseminated term for "breast" in lowland languages (Houston et al. 2006:41). It has been proposed that the breast sign encodes syllabic chu acrophoni cally derived from chu' "breast" (Grube and Nahm 1994:702); however, this reading is still tentative. Like the penis glyph (logo graphic AAT), the breast sign was used as a linguistic building block of larger compounds rather than meaning the body part por trayed. The example in Figure 7c, for instance, forms part of the spelling of the name of a male wahy character suggested to read buch-te-chan (Grube and Nahm 1994:702). The form of the breast hieroglyph is variable but does show con sistency in the delineation of nipples and dotted aureole—-a con vention of Maya breast depiction—at the bottom of essentially two curved lines. This is the same conventional breast treatment seen in the vase figure (Figure 6). Motifs glyphically codified are particularly susceptible to such conceptual usage in Maya art (Stone and Zender 2011). For instance, on page 15c of the Dresden Codex (Lee 1985), the breast of Goddess I is displayed as a sign marking her gender, positioned with disregard to natural ism and oriented downward like the hieroglyph (Figure 7d). I would speculate that the scooped neckline added to the nude woman's body in Figure 6 is also a sign imparting information about her status, even though it is out of place otherwise; this image supports the idea that clothing and breast signs can co-occur in unrealistic ways when they function on a conceptual level. Figure 7. Breast hieroglyph and conventional breast form: (a) Stela 14, Piedras Negras (after drawing courtesy of John Montgomery); (b) Throne I, F4, Piedras Negras (after Houston et al.

As the foregoing demonstrates, the visibility of breasts in relation to clothing does not necessarily mirror realistic dress. It can be driven by iconographic conventions and narrative agenda, and this is especially the case in such graphic media as pictorial ceramics that are symbolically dense. In this view costume and breast exposure are parallel codes, each modifying a constructed message. Costume engages women's social prestige in a way that breast exposure cannot, while breasts convey messages about biological character istics, albeit culturally construed. This is why women with elegant costumes, often gloriously woven, and, contrary to realism, have visible breasts seen through or at the side of the garment, not just in Classic Maya art (e.g., Figure 3b) but also Postclassic central Mexican art (McCafferty and McCafferty 1994:Figure 11). The Maya examples are not see-through garments in most cases; rather breast exposure and costume each comment in their own way. If these images of costumes in relation to breasts are conceptual, it suggests that another type of garment that partly exposes the breast is not realistic either, but the result of synchronic signification of dress and breast exposure. In these cases the woman wears a tight fitting garment midway between a sarong covering the chest and a skirt wrapped under the breasts (Figures 8 and 13b). The" garment covers half the breast or exposes a good part of the breast while curling over it, as though both hiding and revealing. Such clothing seems impractical, if not impossible, to wear and might better be understood in terms of parallel codes. The allusion may be to an</page><page sequence="7">Keeping Abreast of the Maya 173 Figure 8. Partly-exposed breasts using improbable clothing: [a] Half of bosom covered by sarong.

Drawings by the author. attractive, fertile, but still respectable, woman. The partial exposure of the breast could also have had erotic overtones, as partial or full concealment of eroticized body parts is a common ploy to enhance sexual allure (Yalom 1997:3). BODY DECORATION AND THE WHITE BREAST The fact that Landa (Tozzer 1941:126) mentioned the delicate designs tattooed on women's upper bodies is noted by Houston et al. (2006:19). Landa also observed that women did not tattoo their breasts, and this is confirmed in Classic Maya art. On pictorial ceramics women's body and face decorations are often elaborate. Intricacy was an aesthetic preference for women's self-adornment and characterizes body paint, hairstyle, and textile designs. An especially common form of body paint is a swathe of red covering the side of the face, running down the neck and forming a curve around the shoulders (Figures lc, 3a, and 9b). This paint pattern is worn by men but is more consistent with women and seems to be a female trademark. Noting this common style of body decora tion on polychrome ceramics, Houston et al. (2006:23) suggest that it served to mark a visual separation of the head from the chest. However, we might consider Landa's (Tozzer 1941:126) assertion that women wore a red paste (probably made from annatto) to protect themselves from the sun. The face, chest, and shoulder paint pattern seen in Maya art is suited to protect a good deal of the upper body that women typically expose when wearing a sarong, and is also cosmetically attractive. While women may have delicate designs applied to their upper chests, decoration stopped short of the breasts. In fact, the under rated, light-toned appearance of female breasts and other "private" body parts seems to have been conventional. In a vase scene showing nubile women sitting behind a lord, one has her breasts exposed, and they are shown as stark white (Figure 9a). The white color may not just suggest undecorated skin but possibly less-tanned skin. This is implied by images of naked women on vases who have a white body from breasts to knees, exactly where the body is pro tected by clothing (Figure 9b and 9c). This could be white body paint, which was used, especially on women's faces, but I think these examples represent untanned lighter skin (also see K3069), highlighting the loss of clothing by seeing its traces. Adhering to these conventions is the famous painting of the old Goddess O, Chak Chel, from page 74 of the Dresden Codex (Figure 9d). She wears red decoration on her face, neck, and upper body typical of Figure 9. White breasts as an iconographic convention: (a] Court scene with young women.

The combination of red shoulder paint with white breasts and torso may be a feminizing convention of great antiquity in Maya art. It is seen on a nude female depicted on the North Wall of the Late Preclassic San Bartolo murals. Her distinct white body color is pointed out by Saturno et al. (2005:11, Figure 26a). The color white has a number of feminine associations in Maya thought (Vail and Stone 2002:210). THE HOT-COLD SYNDROME AND WOMEN'S FERTILE BODIES Depictions of breasts in Maya art should not be viewed as a detail, like fingers and toes, complementing a natural rendering of women's exposed bodies. The breast was deployed in a conceptual and strategic manner aimed at qualifying female actors in matters ranging from moral character to social and spiritual potency. The</page><page sequence="8">174 Stone breast's range of signification was linked to cultural conceptions of the body. Recovering them for the Classic Maya is no easy matter considering the remoteness of the era and its limited written records, making Houston el al.'s (2006) review of epigraphic and lin guistic evidence especially important. I would like to approach ideas about the female body differently by drawing inferences from ethno graphically attested classification systems used in medical diagnosis and curing in indigenous Maya communities, often characterized as "popular" or "folk" medicine. In terms of bodily conceptions, medical discourse is especially eye-opening because of its deep involvment in the construction of normative standards (Foucault 1978:67). To get at this information, we must turn to ethnographic data, which I believe retains patterns of belief and attitudes about the body that can be projected into the pre-Columbian past. As documented ethnographically, the etiological framework of indigenous Maya medicine is grounded in classification systems concerning the body and things with which it comes in contact. Most important are hot-cold classifications, which intersect with an axis of strong-weak (Adams and Rubel 1967:335). These classi fications characterize fluctuating conditions of the body and explain the causes of its vulnerabilities, strengths, and potential danger to others. As is well known, the sixteenth-century Spanish conquest of the Americas brought with it Hippocratic humoral medicine rooted in a hot-cold, wet-dry diagnostic system. George Foster (1993) has argued that all of Latin America's hot-cold systems, including that of Mesoamerica, where he did fieldwork, are the product of wholesale diffusion, medical knowledge absorbed by indigenous people from Spanish doctors, clinics, and pharmacies and transmitted generationally. If that were indeed the case, bodily conceptions revealed in hot-cold ethnographic data would have little relevance to the present study. However, Foster's perspective has been challenged, notably by López-Austin (1988:272-276). Citing pre-Hispanic retentions in the hot-cold syndrome around Mexico City, among other evidence, López-Austin believes that hot-cold classification pertaining to the body and medicine was in place in Mesoamerica before European contact. He sees such Nahua concepts as the tonalli as a logical pre cursor. More recently, Chevalier and Sánchez (2003:Chapter 9) have presented a methodical and, in my estimation, convincing rebuttal to Foster's position. Part of it hinges on the fact that many features of Spanish humoral medicine are conspicuously absent in Mesoamerica, such as the concept of four humors and the wet-dry diagnostic axis. In their view, the hot-cold component thrived for a very good reason in Mesoamerica: the cognitive frame work for it already existed. An older generation of Maya ethnogra phers generally took a more neutral position claiming that Maya folk medicine was a fusion of pre-Hispanic and humoral concepts (see Adams and Rubel 1967:342; Greenberg 1984; Neuenswander and Souder 1977:97; Redfield 1941:305; Redfield and Redfield 1940: 78; Redfield and Villa Rojas 1962 [1934]:372; Wisdom 1952: 120). For instance, Redfield and Villa Rojas (1962 [1934]:372) note that "ojo" or "evil eye" is of Old World origin, yet associating it with menstruating women—and it is also ascribed to pregnant women—is likely pre-Hispanic. A repeated assertion in the Maya ethnographic literature, dating as far back as the 1940s (Redfield and Redfield 1940), is the ascrip tion of what might be seen as negative associations to women regard ing hot-cold states. Even the fact that relative to men, women are thought of as "cold" in ordinary circumstances (Devereaux 1987: 91; Guiteras-Holmes 1961:4, 306; Hanks 1990:111-112; Neuenswander and Souder 1977:116; Rosenbaum 1993:Chapter 4) seems to put them in a weaker position than men. For instance, in the case of the Tzotzil, Rosenbaum (1993:69) notes that women's sexual organs are seen as cold and loci of feminine weakness. A key issue surrounding women in the hot-cold spectrum is their fluctuating level of heat driven by biological processes, particularly those related to reproduction, such as childbirth, pregnancy, lacta tion, and menstruation. One rationale for this is offered by Greenberg (1984:187) working among the Mam: heat intensifies with social intimacy related to reproduction, while cold is associated with the asocial. During states such as pregnancy, women are believed to have unusually high or "excessive" heat, posing a number of dangers (Adams 1952:16; Guiteras-Holmes 1961:133; Hendrickson 1995:Chapter 4; Neuenswander and Souder 1977: 100-101). It should be noted that excessive heat is not unique to women. Men become excessively hot and dangerous from working in the sun or women from merely working near a fire (Adams and Rubel 1967:343; Neuenswander and Souder 1977: 101; Redfield and Villa Rojas 1962 [1934]: 161). Excessive heat due to women's fertility-related biology is believed to make them weak and vulnerable (Adams and Rubel 1967:335; Redfield and Villa Rojas 1962 [1934]: 161; Wisdom 1940:312, 1952:129-130). Because of this, pregnancy and other female conditions are typically viewed as illnesses (Boremanse 1998:77; Greenberg 1984:187; Hanks 1990:112; Paul and Paul 1975:707). Among the K'iche' bodily heat is transferred to both blood and breast milk (Neuenswander and Souder 1977:100). Equivalence between these fluids is made in other parts of Mesoamerica (Monaghan 2001:285). Chevalier and Sanchez (2003:54) report in the Sierra de Santa Marta, Veracruz, that nursing is considered risky for the mother in that it depletes her "water of life," much like blood loss. Here, even nursing makes a woman weak and vulnerable. Maya ethnographers portray women's intensified heat as a state of imbalance, one that is not only detrimental to a woman's health, but also can affect others in undesirable ways, making "hot" women threatening. Women's excessive heat accompanies what is some times called "strong blood" (Adams 1952:16; Wisdom 1940:308). In the Tz'utujiil village of San Pedro La Laguna, a woman posses sing this is considered promiscuous, barren, and a pariah (Paul 1974:291). Female heat correlates with sexual promiscuity (Hanks 1990:112) and this also carries an element of danger (Devereaux 1987:101). Women's excessive heat can be injurious, especially to males and children in general, and is a recognized cause of disease, associated with "evil eye." For instance, Holland (1964: 275), working among the Tzotzil, reports a disease, tsu jem k'at, afflicting the genitalia of male children after being visited by a preg nant woman. The mere glance of a pregnant woman can sicken a child because her heat can penetrate the child's body (Holland 1964:164). Something similar is reported by Wisdom (1940:326) among the Ch'orti', where pregnant and menstruating women are believed to possess a harmful wind that not only injures others but is also the source of their own spiritual pollution. Here, too, curses are especially associated with women (Wisdom 1940:333). The belief that pregnant women have "evil eye," are ritually pol luted, and can cause illness is widely reported (Adams 1952:62; Manning 1999:317; Neuenswander and Souder 1977:115; Redfield and Villa Rojas 1962 [ 1934]: 182-183; Wisdom 1940: 314). Pregnant women's proclivity to cause illness in children is also related to emotional imbalance, such as wanting a child in the first place (Adams 1952:16, 62; see also Paul 1974:295). Redfield and Villa Rojas (1962 [1934]: 169, Note 1) report in Yucatan that when a girl's menses begins she is capable of emitting</page><page sequence="9">Keeping Abreast of the Maya 175 a "virgin wind" that can make other children sick. Menstruating girls are told not to look at children or yard animals, lest they kill them, in San Pedro (Paul 1974:291). Paul (1974:298) describes a Pedrano view of female fertility conceived in magical terms as an instrument of punitive power. Men can be destroyed by contact with women's menstrual blood, and women are believed to, and apparently do, connive to arrange such contact as vengeance. Women can be detri mental to masculine work activities where coming in contact with a woman's garment or utensil—even a lowly pottery sherd—can spoil the entire effort (Redfield and Villa Rojas 1962 [ 1934]: 169). In San Pedro, the Tz'utujiil believe that a husband's masculinity can be destroyed by his wife's proximity to his farming tools or his contact with her work equipment (Paul 1974:184). By sifting through these ethnographic data, certain themes emerge about women's bodies considered on the hot-cold spectrum. Most striking is the issue of women's biologically-driven, fluctuat ing state of excessive heat and its deleterious effects. According to this view, women have an innate potential to inflict harm on others related to their reproductive role. Aberrant behaviors, such as prom iscuity, issuing curses, or producing lethal emanations, are also attributed to women because of heat imbalance. We might compare this perspective with one found in a fairly recent study of the hot-cold syndrome by Chevalier and Sánchez (2003) concern ing Popolucas and Nahuas in the Sierra Santa Marta, Veracruz. While reporting on a wholly different ethnic region, the authors are clearly dealing with related phenomena. Chevalier and Sánchez reiterate some of the same points made about women in the Maya ethnographic literature: that menstruation and pregnancy are hotter than normal states (2003:26, 54) and that women's heat can be harmful to children, animals, and plants (2003:56). Women in a state of excessive heat, indeed, should not go near agri cultural fields because they may cause flowers to wither (2003:163). Their model looks at the larger picture; however, with less sense of the aberration and stigma that permeates the Maya literature. The indigenous perspective portrayed by Chevalier and Sánchez (2003:47) is one in which women's fluctuating heat, although reach ing an intense, potentially dangerous level, is viewed as normal and necessary. Hot and cold states are expected to rise and fall in regular cycles, even on a daily basis (one heats up in the day and cools off at night). In fact, the absence of expected fluctuations is considered a greater cause for alarm. Understanding the hot-cold syndrome as a continuously fluctuating cycle, Chevalier and Sánchez (2003:24. 41-47) position it within a cycle of "heliotropic movement" related to the life cycle and agricultural cycle: born in water (cold), mature and gain strength in the sun (hot), and eventually burn up and dry out due to heat insults. Fluctuations in heat are therefore required, even if destructive, for the continuation of life. Their broad, philosophical perspective provides different shades of understanding women's condition than the more fragmented data typically presented in Maya ethnographies, some of which reflect earlier generations of scholarly thinking. MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE AND THE BREAST AS AN INDEX OF A FERTILE WOMAN Hot-cold data provide a general framework for proposing that the ancient Maya attributed innate power to a woman's body, a power that they may have seen as fluctuating in intensity and character over her life course. Ethnographic reports typically describe this power as harmful in mundane interactions; however, in ritual it was likely harnessed to empower things for desirable ends. Yaxchilan Lintel 26 (Figure 4) was earlier interpreted in this light. Given the ominous connotations of pregnancy in hot-cold classifi cations, its association with illness and danger, it is noteworthy that Maya art is bereft of naturalistic representations of pregnant women. In fact, a bloated abdomen was a conventional sign of illness, disease, and death (likewise in modern folk medicine the abdomen and umbilicus are implicated in disease process). Bloated stomachs are seen on disfigured males, skeletal beings, and other grotesques. The woman shown giving birth on The Birth Vase (Taube 1994) has a standard body shape, even though she is pregnant (Figure 10a). It seems depicting pregnant women naturalistically was avoided or had inherent ambiguity given the association of bloating with death and disease. Rather than stomach or genitals, breasts played a major role in cueing a woman's fertile state in Classic Maya art. Beautiful women's breasts are typically shown as full and large. While this may seem aimed purely at voyeuristic enjoyment, it could also reflect a state for women understood within the system of medical knowledge. As reported by Chevalier and Sánchez (2003:54), women's bodies are in a strong position when full of the "water of life," something depleted by pregnancy and nursing, which make them weak. Full round breasts suggest a hydrated body, pos sessing a host of positive connotations. Breast display may have cued a woman's fertile body, but within this broad category there was a range of narrower significations regarding her status—is this a proper married woman, an unmarried woman, a seductress, etc.? Such semantic refinements could be con veyed by context, as breast exposure had no single fixed meaning; this had to be scenically or otherwise cued. The woman on The Birth Vase, actually giving birth, an act associated with fertility, has full round breasts shown frontally (Figure 10a), while the old midwives who surround her have flat breasts in profile (Figure 10b and 10c). On the other hand, a woman consulting a diviner has covered breasts as her fertility is not the key issue regard ing her status (Figure lOd). For the women whose breasts are exposed on the Birth Vase, fertility is critical—for the old women, the lack of it. Here context and contrast (the juxtaposition of old and young, covered and uncovered) make the connotations of the parturient's exposed breasts apparent. A different sense of exposed breasts emerges in images of god desses and mythical females, represented on painted ceramics. Most supernatural females are topless, often displaying breasts frontally and/or prominently (Figure 1 1). Goddesses and mythical actors account for the majority of bare-breasted women seen on painted vases. In a similar vein, complete female nudity on pictorial cer amics (e.g.. Figure 9b) largely concerns mythology and the superna tural. This can be explained by the fact that the archetypal and dramatic nature of mythology often demands nude female actors in portrayals that are not constrained by social norms. Even the Popol Viih has a story of naked maidens doing their wash by a river to seduce their fathers' enemies (Christenson 2003:242), hardly a realistic scenario. Breast exposure of goddesses also served to denote their typological classification, something of utmost concern in the organization of the pantheon. This role for the breast is most evident in the Postclassic period Maya codices whose only female actors are goddesses (e.g.. Figures 7c and 9d) and over 90% of them are bare-breasted. With goddesses, the youth ful round breast sometimes carries a sense of danger, transgression, or seduction along the lines of Thompson's (1939) characterization of the promiscuous Maya Moon Goddess. This recalls ideas about female fertility, excessive heat, threatening magical power, and</page><page sequence="10">176 Stone Figure 10. Strategies of breast exposure on The Birth Vase: [a] Woman, with full, round frontal breasts, giving birth; [b-c] Aged divine midwives with deflated, hanging breasts; [d] Woman with covered breasts. Drawings by the author (after Kerr Archive No. K5II3). the danger of sexuality reported in the hot-cold system (see also Vail and Stone 2002:222-224). The Serpent-Woman Theme, seen on a series of codex-style vases (Figure 11c), where the goddess' breasts can be enormous to the point of appearing abnormal, where a phallic serpent passes between her legs, and she is lusted after by a decrepit old god, is rife with such transgressive senti ments. Several demonic underworld goddesses are shown with pro minent frontal breasts, also suggesting a threatening aspect rather than just classifying them as such or providing erotic interest (Figure 11a and lib). The implications of danger in excessive sexual libido and female fertility are fully consonant with ethnographically-attested medical discourse. On the other hand, historical women appearing in courtly scenes or accompanying male actors on painted ceramics rarely fully expose their breasts by donning only a skirt. More often their breasts are made visible while they still wear clothing, or they wear low-cut sarongs that reveal part of the breast (Figures 3b, 5a, and 5b). This limitation on breast exposure for historical women suggests a different concern in defining them than the mythical actors, one tied to their social status. In terms of constructing this pictorially, clothing and costume appurtenances are indispensable; therefore clothing cannot easily be dispensed with. Hints at seeing Figure II.

Drawings by the author. women's breasts while a fair bit of clothing is worn, using the tech niques earlier described, such as x-ray appearances and bodices curling over breasts, seems to be a compromise between the requi site display of social rank and biological status. The sculpted ceramic figurines of women, as isolated represen tations, are different than images of women on painted ceramics who appear in narrative scenes delineated by graphic conventions and symbols and are juxtaposed in contrastive ways to construct meaning. A substantial number of figurines present a standard type of attractive, well-dressed woman sporting an intricate hairdo and wearing handsome jewelry. Here the preferred mode of expos ing the breasts is the low-slung quechquemitl or huípil (Figure 2b). Breasts are also seen through clothing (Figure 5c), as in painted vases, by having garments cling around the breasts. These figurines seem to embody proper married women, but may not be ones of the highest class. They portray positive female stereotypes, often associ ated with domestic labor, such as weaver, corn grinder, and child caregiver (Joyce 1992, 2000a:68-69). They more readily show idealized, non-supernatural women bare-breasted than in any other media, something that may correlate with their frequent association with domestic compounds and household rituals. THE POST-MENOPAUSAL WOMAN'S BREASTS Classic Maya art constructs adult female stereotypes along the lines of two overarching categories, a young, fertile woman and an old, post-menopausal, grandmotherly woman, a binary division that has ethnographic and ethnohistoric parallels (Manning 1999; Stone 1990). It is also recognized that the post menopausal grand mother figure had (and still has) a respected—to A degree privileged—place in society, ritual life, and ideology (Stone 1988: 76-77, 1990; Vail and Stone 2002:224-226). One function was to serve as midwife, and this was tied in religious thought to a powerful role as primordial creator goddess. In the Popol Vuh the old, mighty,</page><page sequence="11">Keeping Abreast of the Maya 177 creator goddess, Xmucane, is given the respected title i'yom or "midwife" (Christenson 2003:62-63; Manning 1999:308-310). The preeminent aged goddess in the Classic period is dubbed Goddess O; her diagnostic traits, such as a jaguar ear and serpent head tie, have been described by Taube (1992:99-105) who also discovered her role as midwife on The Birth Vase (Taube 1994). Unfortunately, there are precious few depictions of Goddess O in Classic Maya art, mainly occurring on several painted vases and fig urines (Figures 10b and 12a). However, a modeled stucco head of this character, thought to be from the Palenque area and originally placed on a building (Grube and Gaida 2006:Plate 35), is a tantaliz ing hint that there were cult shrines dedicated to her within Classic Maya cities (Figure 12b). Objects such as this make all too clear our limited grasp of her importance in religious practices sponsored by the elite, possibly elite women. Data concerning the cognized view of the body of a post menopausal woman in the hot-cold system are not entirely consist ent. In some Maya ethnographies, aged bodies are considered cold and weak. Among the K'iche' aged bodies are cold "because they have no more strength" (Neuenswander and Souder 1977:116). Chevalier and Sánchez (2003:Chapter 2), on the other hand, suggest that heat increases with age and, while it stimulates growth early on, it eventually desiccates and ruins the body, causing death. An aged body may seem inferior because of its weak nesses, but this is not always the case. Recall that fertility-related biological processes of young women give them "hot blood," infus ing them with a contagion so dangerous that they are not supposed to approach certain classes of people, such as children. Infertile, elderly women can "do no harm" in this regard; their bodies are neither fertile nor dangerous. Manning (1999:317) affirms that old women make good midwives precisely because they are past their reproductive stage, and, apart from not having to look after young children, they are safe with respect to fertility's potential dangers and may freely act in a healing capacity. This fact should color how we view the breasts of aged women depicted in Classic Maya art. I would aver that the motif of the old woman's breast, characteristically flattened, is a semantically dense sign and not just a caricature of aged anatomy. We can understand its sense in terms of the fact that bodily heat in native folk medicine generally intensifies with the efficacy and strength of the body's Figure 12. Goddess O and aged women: (a] Goddess O as curer. Painted vase (after Kerr Archive No. K6020); (b) Goddess O head from architec tural context.

Drawings by the author. biological processes. Thus, bodies that do not work well, that are physically weak or ineffectual, such as breasts that will not lactate, are cold. The idea of the flat, aged breast as an ineffectual body part is suggested by an entry in Wisdom's Ch'orti' vocabulary, cited by Houston et al. (2006:40), that relates a post-ejaculatory, flaccid penis to an old woman's breasts. The comparison may not just be that they both hang limply, but that they are useless and dried up. The fact that an old woman's breasts do not work well, apparent in their deflated, dry state, is not necessarily a bad thing, as just stated. I propose that the two stereotypical types of breasts seen in Maya art first, contrast with each other primarily on the basis of full ness versus flatness as a sign of efficacy and health, and second, encode biologically-based female power but each of a different sort. The young breast invokes female fertility and can convey either the benefit or danger of its power. The deflated breast is a sign of female power associated with elderly women. In modern communities older, mature women typically are expert healers, herb alists, and midwives (Oakes 1951:184, Plate 9; Watanabe 1992:190; Wisdom 1940:354), and the flattened breast implies mastery of those skills as well as domestic skills, like weaving; and it is the heads of old women in Classic Maya art that carry the spindle to signal this (Figure 12c). The flattened breast also connotes social power that accrues with advanced age (Houston et al. 2006:49). This is suc cinctly put by Watanabe (1992:123) for the Mam who characterize old age as "sexually sterile but socially powerful." For depictions of old women in Maya art, signs of bodily weakness suggest other forms of power. Ironically, the sagging, ineffectual breast is a critical marker of this prestigious status. COVERED BREASTS IN CLASSIC MAYA PUBLIC ART While the breasts of female figures are both hidden and revealed in small-scale media, the breasts of aristocratic, historical women shown in monumental public art, especially stone reliefs and large murals, are never exposed, and in fact these women tend to wear generous garments masking much of their anatomy. This suggests an etiquette of female body exposure tied to elite rank, the formality and prestige of ceremonies, and an appropriate level of decorum established by art media. In a series of publications exploring issues of sex and gender, Rosemary Joyce (see, for example, 2000a:59-67, 2000b) has proposed ways of looking at women's constrained body exposure in public art. She concludes that male protagonists are presented in a more emphatically sexual light in contrast to women whose sexuality is suppressed; basing much of this on the fact that more of men's naked bodies are exposed than women's due to the disparity of clothing (e.g., Figure 4). No one can deny that Maya art has sexual interests, both obvious and veiled (Stone 1988); however, I would like to suggest other ways of looking at this apparent gendered difference in bodily display. Women's voluminous clothing is understood in Joyce's analysis as a means of suppressing their sexual status (Joyce 2000a), some thing gauged by the degree of "exposed body parts" (Joyce 2001: 116-117). The formula for sexuality is the physical body revealed—naked skin and, for men, their facial hair (Joyce 2000a, 2000b, 2001). However, sexual imagery may involve strategically hiding anatomy or revealing body parts that have nothing to do with primary or secondary sexual characteristics. It is also important to remember that Maya men wore far skimpier clothing than women in routine life (something true in much of native Mesoamerica and North America). To what extent was this mode of dress in real life</page><page sequence="12">178 Stone symptomatic of an emphasis on male sexual status and suppression of women's (who could, in domestic settings, go topless), or was it related to dress adapted to gendered work activities? While the display of naked male flesh in battle, ballgame, hunting, and ritual scenes has been interpreted by Joyce in a sexual light, it is also part of the practicality of dress that people saw day-in and day-out. It's possible that a king with richly appointed cloth, jade, and feather trappings, such as Itzamnaaj Balam II on Yaxchilan Lintel 24 (Joyce 2000b:Figure 15.1), would not be admired so much for his naked thigh as his sumptuous costume. This determi nation is ultimately subjective; but Joyce acknowledges that the phalli of aristocratic males were also discreetly covered in Classic Maya public art, even when performing phallic bloodletting. In monumental public art, feminizing traits so commonplace in portable media are more restrained or absent in the case of breast exposure. Joyce construes this as a neutralization of female sexual status. However, it may result from an overarching concern with wealth and power relations communicated by generous, elaborate costume. The absence of feminizing traits on women in public art is also in the area of the head, as the head was a prime site of female identity as pictorially constructed. In public art, women's heads are often covered in angular headdresses, full of iconographic information but leaving no room for the elongated head and frilly hair treatment. The huípil covers body contours and a jade collar fills in the usually exposed neck area. I concur with Joyce (2000:60) that these unrevealing costumes are deliberate choices but see them in terms of the construction of an identity based on wealth, dynastic affiliation, and mystical connections with the supernatural, as well as observance of an etiquette of body exposure in formal settings. While women's naked flesh is obscured by costume, it is not entirely accurate to characterize women's body type as sexually neutral on public monuments (Joyce 2000a:60). Scholars have noted the characteristic plumpness of women in Classic represen tations (Houston et al. 2006:51). Indeed, the ideal female body tended toward the large and hefty. Often in male-female comp lementary pairs, the woman is at least as large as, if not larger than, the male counterpart as seen, for instance, at Palenque in the Tablet of the Slaves and Dumbarton Oaks Panel 2 (Scheie and Miller 1986:Figure VII.3), but also on painted ceramics showing imposing women seated with their lordly husbands (Figure 13a). In discussing "semantics of body shape," Anne Becker (1994: 102) observes, "Aesthetic preferences for body shape and size are informed by core societal values." This is certainly the case for the hefty bodies of women in Maya art. I doubt that their corpulence simply mirrors an aesthetic appreciation of fat, but rather invokes women's physical strength and health—a vital fluid-filled state in indigenous medical terms—and their mastery of domestic labor. This competence was not only a source of their own pride but also very appealing to men. Ethnographic studies in some Maya communities indicate men fear they will perish if not taken care of by a wife and are especially worried they will starve to death if ground corn and tortillas are not prepared for them. The stereotype of the ideal wife as hard worker is expressed by Mam men of Santiago Chimaltenango in their characterization of a productive woman as "strong, fat and very handsome" (Wagley 1949:21). Joyce (1992) herself has cogently argued that women's productive labor is central to their stereotypical representation in Maya art, and I believe that gendered activities account more for men and women's costume disparities than concern for sexual display. Female physical strength and work capacity cannot be divorced from women's identity as sexual beings; ethnographically, the exchange of both sex and labor Figure 13. Imposing stature and blocky body shape of women: (a) Throne scene with nobleman and wife. Painted vase (after Kerr Archive No. K4996); (b) Domestic scene of large woman grinding corn for husband.

This attitude is delightfully apparent in a painted plate showing a scrawny man relaxing with a cigar while his gargantuan wife busily makes his masa for tamales—truly a male fantasy of a desirable hefty woman and domestic bliss (Figure 13b). Women's large girth can be appreciated even when they wear a voluminous huípil, which gives them a characteristic boxy shape. This blocky body silhouette (e.g., Figures la, 3b, and 4) is conven tionally feminine. Curvaceous and swirling lines are as well, so kneeling women shown on Yaxchilan lintels, with their squarish bodies and swirling hemlines, projected feminine appeal and are not sexually neutralized by their clothing. There is far more fabric present than needed to cover their bodies; evidently the cornucopia of fabric had positive and possibly sensual connotations. Who is to say how sexually alluring such an image appeared to a viewer incul cated into this kind of aesthetic appreciation of a woman's body? BREAST ANOMALIES As mentioned earlier, one of the most potent contrastive strategies of breast signification is absence versus presence. This is not just when the breast is covered, thereby making it "absent," but when it is</page><page sequence="13">Keeping Abreast of the Maya 179 uncovered and absent. One repeated occurrence of this absence consists of very feminine-looking figures depicted on vases that are nude from the waist up but have no visible indication of breasts. Was this anatomical detail an option that could be omitted? Was the omission something inadvertent and unimportant if the context were clear? Or were the breasts left out for deliberate reasons? Some cases of breast omission are striking and possibly were deliberate ways of constructing other gender identities. One vase depicts an apparent woman, cued unequivocally by her skirt, hair, and boxy body shape, performing a playful dance with a phallic-nosed male (Taube 1989:Figure 24-14). This femin ized individual wears a delicate open-weave top, resembling a loose gauze weave, through which the entire chest area can plainly be seen and where there are no traces of breasts (Figure 14a). I proposed that this woman is a female impersonator whose very lack of breasts in conjunction with feminine traits made this apparent (Stone 1995:144-145). Female impersonation is still commonly practiced in Maya ritual performance, both in comic and serious dances, and certainly was a feature of pre-Hispanic culture. Another ambiguously gendered figure on a vase is indi cated as female by the skirt and feminized gestures: gracefully Figure 14. Breast anomalies: (a) Female impersonator in humorous ritual dance (after Kerr Archive No. K1549]; (b) Feminized figure lacks breasts, suggesting gender ambiguity (after Roblcsek and Hales [l981:Vessel 68]); (c) Bare-breasted woman in large-scale architectural sculpture. Painted carved stucco, 70 cm high (after Maya: The Barbachano Ponce Mayan Art Collection [1976:No. 148]). Drawings by the author. Figure 15. Construction of a ceramic vessel depicting an old woman shows the addition of breasts as separate unit from body. Structure 24, Yaxchilan. Drawing by the author (after Scheie [1997:50, Plate 34]]. twisting, with one hand touching the chin (Figure 14b). This appar ent female has neither breasts nor indication of the dark wispy hair so characteristic of women. The question can be raised if this is a woman or feminized male. To offer speculation, the figure could represent the wife or concubine of the adjacent seated lord—in this mythical scene an anthropomorphized monkey-like figure— but is not a woman per se, and instead may be a Two-Spirit femin ized male, a type of Third Gender that surely existed in ancient Mesoamerica (López-Austin 1988:303; Looper 2002). If that were the case, it is interesting to see that the gendered indicators are pre served in the skirt and style of body gestures, but the anatomical breasts are omitted. Perhaps Third Genders were constructed picto rially through mixed characteristics. That conventions structured breast exposure in Maya art is best appreciated when these conventions are violated, as they are in a painted stucco sculpture in a private collection, said to be from a Classic period building in Yucatan. The torso was found separate from the head (Maya: The Barbachano Ponce Mayan Art Collection [1976:Number 148]). But even without the head, the torso, if authentic, is anomalous in showing a bare-breasted, appar ently high-status woman in a large-scale sculpture that was displayed on a public building (Figure 14c). While this in itself is unique, neither clothed nor bare-breasted women wear an insignia such as this one does, a trefoil-ended pectoral usually associated with male ceremonial attire or as an insignia of male gods. This last anomaly may provide evidence that the pieces of the sculpture were cobbled together; but even if the torso alone has integrity, it represents some thing unusual. The suggestion of lines painted on the face, barely evident in the photograph, could mean that this is an old woman. CONCLUSIONS The female breast in Maya art has been recognized primarily as a site of erotic interest (Houston et al. 2006:42; Joyce 2003) or part</page><page sequence="14">180 Stone of the caricature of an aged woman. This paper discusses its capacity to encode a range of information by its presence, absence, shape, and context. The breast as social construct is also hinted at by technological features. This concerns the fabrication of Jaina figurines of women where the preponderance of attention, in terms of refinement and detailed appliqué, is given to that part of the body above the waist: the face, head, and breast-shoulder area. Corson (1976:17) noted this for a recurrent type of female figurine from Jaina (e.g., Figures lb and 2b) and drew a contrast with the lower body and covering garment (a skirt or bottom of a huípil), which form an unarticulated solid mass. A similar disparity was observed among female figurines from Piedras Negras (Schlosser 1978:135). This technical variance can be understood as an adher ence to pictorial conventions for constructing feminine stereotypes in all media of Classic Maya art where the most nuanced discrimi nation is generally in the head, breast, and shoulder area. Skirts had an emblematic quality as a quintessential^ female garment, as dis cussed by Klein (2000) for the Aztecs. However, more attention was paid to the head and chest area, especially so among figurines where skirt patterns are often disregarded. This underscores the fact that these figurines are not so much dedicated to capturing faithful like nesses as constructing socially meaningful bodies. The interconnection of figurine technology and the breast as an autonomous sign is most evident in figurines of old women. Often their sagging breasts were added as independent units to a torso. The body was crafted first; then a slab skirt added over it. The flat breasts were then attached to the chest wall so that they can hang over the top of the skirt (Figure 15); this would be physically impossible if the breasts were not put in place after the construction of the body and skirt. Although not true in every case, old women's breasts stereotypically hang over their skirts (Figures 10b and 12a), and so the technology works in the service of this convention. In some cases these added breasts are not well blended into the body and look like strange chest ornaments rather than anatomy. Alberti (2001) interpreted similar technological features of breast construction on Late Bronze Age faience figurines of a serpent wielding goddess from Knossos—here the breasts and part of the clothing were fabricated as a single unit—as evidence of the breasts' role in crafting a sexed and gendered body comparable to clothing and other body ornamentation. In other words, the breasts were not conceived as an extension of natural anatomy but served the same socially constructive role as costume. As a sign, the breast suggests fertility-related biological status as filtered through a cultural lens. The signifying power of the breast thus expands through a chain of associative properties. These prop erties are not just on the body's surface but are also internal and unseen, as suggested by hot-cold data. I would argue that these cul tural constructs referenced by the breast, for both young and old women, allude to variant strains of female power (whether harmful or beneficial), tied to bodily conceptions, a power in women's bodies but visible on the surface through the breasts. Breasts can be an index of women's power. Although Maya art is infused with an androcentric bias, this did not result in the universal objectifica tion of women or their breasts in purely sexual terms. The implications of the breast within the cognized view of the body were part of the mindset of male and female alike. Much as the phallus did for men, breasts could convey female power through an associative chain that involved practices (bloodletting for men, nursing or other domestic duties for women, or curative roles for old women) as well as properties inherent to the body. The contras tive, dyadic nature of the youthful and aged breast in the Classic period, used as a device to construct female stereotypes, argues against reading the exposed breast of young women too narrowly in terms of sexual desire; the contrast between young and old women's breasts is certainly not limited to a distinction based on erotic attaction. Interestingly, the shape contrast between youthful and aged breasts was lost in the Late Postclassic Maya codices where breasts of young and old goddesses are identical and seem to serve a generic role identifying female deities, a general pattern of Postclassic Mesoamerican art. This suggests that the concern for creating nuanced social and semantic distinctions driving these con trasts in Classic depictions was not operative in the codices with their emphasis on divine patrons of seasonal almanacs. In the codices it can be argued that the breast was an obligatory marker of the female body, while the chests of male gods are flat and unmarked (Vail and Stone 2002); this role may have contributed to the breast's uniform appearance in the codices. The "marked" status of the feminine form also suggests an androcentric perspec tive as unmarked forms tend to stand for what is understood to be universal and dominant (Butler 1990:17). Although gauging the full panoply of Maya art is impossible, my sense is that breast exposure for historical women, who wear just a skirt, occurs rarely in the corpus of painted ceramic vessels. On the other hand, ceramic figurines frequently show women exposing their breasts. This may reflect a less courtly context for the figurines, and concomitantly figurines depict women's routine domestic labor more directly and frequently. Breast exposure was not fully compa tible with images intended to emphasize high social status, and often breasts were made visible even though chests were ostensibly covered by clothing, not for the sake of propriety, but to gain the prestige benefit of clothing. Mythical and divine women, on the other hand, frequently expose their breasts. For defining goddesses, breast exposure was, on one level, a useful typological tool. In addition, mythology is not bound by the norms of human society and is freer to manipulate the body for dramatic effect. These dis similar approaches suggest varying ways of understanding breast exposure in different thematic contexts. The association of women's breasts with power inherent to their bodies as well as their domestic and medical competence suggests that women's bodies were seen on some level as instruments of their own agency and not just a means of objectifying them (Butler 1990: 17). Maya art is rife with structural parallels. The breast is in many respects a counterpart to the phallus, each encoded hierogly phically and each serving as a mystified body part and potent com municator of ideas. While the symbolic force of male genitalia in Maya art has been recognized, the female breast has not been given its due. RESUMEN Los senos femeninos han sido un motivo importante en la historia del arte mundial y esto es igualmente cierto del arte maya prehispánico, donde las mujeres con los senos expuestos son comúnmente representadas. Era un cos tumbre aceptable para las mujeres llevar sólo una falda sin cubrir el pecho o</page><page sequence="15">Keeping Abreast of the Maya 181 llevar una blusa suelta, exponiendo así los senos. Esta práctica es confirmada en ejemplos numerosos del arte prehispánico, y también fue observada por el obispo de Yucatan, Diego de Landa, en el siglo XVI. Imágenes de las mujeres con los senos expuestos fueron producidas principalmente durante el período clásico tardío visto entre vasijas pintadas, figurillas de cerámica y otros objetos portátiles; por otro lado, son raros en el arte público monu mental donde los cuerpos de las mujeres aristocráticas nunca se presentaron sin cubrir el pecho. En lugar de reflejar algunas cualidades universales de cuerpos naturales, los senos femeninos fueron concebidos según los gustos, valores y supuestos sobre el cuerpo humano predominante en la soci edad maya antigua. Por ejemplo, los senos ideales, normalmente para las mujeres fecundas, mostrados plenos y grandes, nunca aparecían decorados con pintura roja y frecuentemente eran coloreados en pintura blanca. El fil trado de los senos a través de un lente cultural estimuló las representaciones artísticas muy conceptuales, por ejemplo, hacer los senos visibles, aunque la figura es totalmente vestida. La representación de los senos se ha normali zado en un jeroglífico cuya lectura todavía no se ha establecido; muchas imágenes muestran la misma estilización como el jeroglífico, es decir con el pezón en la parte inferior del seno. La utilidad simbólica de los senos deriva en parte del hecho de que su forma física no es estática sino que cambia de acuerdo a las etapas de la vida de las mujeres, como el envejecimiento o el embarazo. La forma de los senos, por lo tanto, podría ser utilizado como un índice del estado biológico de la mujer. La distinción más básica se hizo entre los senos plenos de las mujeres fecundas y los senos delgados y planos de las mujeres viejas post-menopáusicas. Los artistas mayas entendieron el poten cial semiótico de los senos y utilizaron el principio de contraste, en la morfología de los senos y si fueron expuestos u ocultados por medio de la ropa, o fueron extrañamente ausentes, para construir los estereotipos feme ninos que varían por la edad, la clase, el estado sobrenatural y la ambigüedad de género. Los senos señalaron más que la edad de la mujer o su capacidad reproductiva, sino también se refiere a las cualidades internas del cuerpo femenino que tenían connotaciones de la agencia, la competencia, el poder y el peligro. Estos significados más esotéricos pueden extrapolarse a partir de estudios etnográficos de la medicina maya del pasado reciente. El sistema de caliente-frío atribuía un calor excesivo a las mujeres fecundas y otras calidades de poder y peligro. El cuerpo frío de una mujer vieja, mien tras que es "débil." fue visto como liberado de la sexualidad excesiva y su peligro inherente, lo que sugiere otras formas de competencia. Estos datos etnográficos sobre los cuerpos de las mujeres en el discurso médico arrojan luz sobre los senos como un índice de estereotipos femeninos basados en la edad y fertilidad de la mujer.
