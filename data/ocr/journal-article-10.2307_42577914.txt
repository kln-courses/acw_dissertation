<plain_text><page sequence="1">RETROSPECT • FIFTY YEARS AGO IN ETC • Communication reduces to the event, both commonplace and awesome, of Mr. A. talking to Mr. B. And most common- place and strange of all - possibly the most distinctively hu- man occurrence to be found or imagined - is the case in which Mr. A. and Mr. B. are one and the same person: a man talking to himself. Every speaker is, of course, his own listener, even when (if not especially when) he is speaking in public. In fact, even when he is alone, a man speaking to himself is by no means removed psychologically from his social context. What he talks about, to whom (in imagination) and for what purpose, are matters which are never independent of his concerns, associations and motivations as a social being. Mr. A. talking to Mr. B. is, therefore, a social phenomenon, whether or not Mr. A. and Mr. B. are one or two persons. And it is communi- cation, viewed as Mr. A. talking to Mr. B., with respect to both its individual and social implications, that is here to be examined, with particular attention to the relationship be- tween speech and personality. The essential point to be made in this discussion is that when speech is frustrated, per- sonality is frustrated, too, whether personality be viewed as a 234</page><page sequence="2">Retrospect 235 process of self-realization or with respect to the role it plays in effective social interaction. Speech is, of course, a form of language behavior and re- flects the characteristics of language regarded in its broader aspects. It reflects, in fact, the basic features of symbolic sys- tems generally, so that whatever we may say in the present discussion concerning speech and personality will have im- plications with respect to the relationships between personal- ity and the uses of other symbolic forms and media as well. The consequences and causes of speech frustration are in some ways and in some measure the consequences and the causes of frustration of the processes involved in graphic ar- tistic expression, in mathematizing, in the dramatic interpre- tation of experience, in music, architecture, law, or any of the other facets of symbolic functioning. The science which treats of symbolisms and symbolizations, in themselves and in their interrelationships with one another and with individual and social phenomena, is known as general semantics, and to the extent that it encompasses the scope of consideration here indicated, this discussion presents a general semantic ap- proach to problems of communication. Wendell Johnson "Speech and Personality" The separation of fact and value and the apparent limita- tions of science form the point of departure of these critical studies. Professor Whitehead's genetic analysis begins with the Cartesian assumption of individual independent sub- stances of body and mind, discrete, spatially and temporally located. Then he develops the epistemology that emerged to fit the needs of this dichotomy, and the subsequent devalua- tion of "matter" and the preoccupation with "brute" fact. Even after William James had annihilated consciousness-as- entity and substituted consciousness-as-function and the mo- dal fusion of subject-object in the stream of thought, this out- look still persists. Along with Pierce's studies in logic and</page><page sequence="3">236 Etcetera • Summer 1998 metaphysics, James provided one of the matrices of White- head's own attempt to visualize the world in organic-process terms. And Susanne K. Langer shows in her investigation of current epistemological assumptions that, as a student of Whitehead, she shares his desire to reassert the union of sci- ence and philosophy, of rationalism and experience, or what we might colloquially call mind and heart .... Whitehead finds the key to the success (and limitation) of science in its adoption of the mathematical ways of handling reality. He points out that "the dominance of the idea of functionality in the abstract sphere of mathematics found it- self reflected in the order of nature under the guise of mathe- matically expressed laws of nature. Apart from this progress of mathematics, the seventeenth century ['the century of genius'] developments of science would have been impossi- ble. Mathematics supplied the background of imaginative thought with which the men of science approached the ob- servation of nature." The implications of this quotation are widened by Mrs. Langer' s concept of the generative idea. For her the history of thought is a movement of concepts in terms of which the questions we put to the universe of our experi- ence are framed. The generative idea limits the kind of ques- tions asked, just as our abilities to conceptualize provides the limits of our perceptions. For example, as Whitehead illus- trates, "The birth of modern physics depended upon the ap- plication of the abstract idea of periodicity to a variety of concrete instances." Furthermore, Whitehead asserts that we "have been living upon the accumulated capital of ideas pro- vided ... by the genius of the seventeenth century." And Mrs. Langer adds that "the generative ideas of the seventeenth century ... have served their term. The difficulties inherent in their constitutive concepts balk us now; their paradoxes clog our thinking. If we would have new knowledge, we must get us a whole world of new questions." Sherman Paul" Whitehead, Langer, and the Uniting of'Fact' and 'Value' "</page><page sequence="4">Retrospect 237 The controversy over the question of whether or not ana- lytical, or aristotelian, definitions are statements which can be true or false is one of our few heritages from the Middle Ages which still retains its vitality. Markedly nominalist in temper as our times are, they have not yet witnessed the emergence of any definitive nominalist solution of this cru- cial issue, on which hinges perhaps the entire character of our approach to the art of acquiring knowledge of the world. Those who favor a semantic treatment of definition say that definitions are merely agreements to use a certain word in a certain way; but the view that they are statements which re- veal the nature of what is defined still persists. There are cer- tain difficulties with this latter view, however, which in my opinion make it no longer tenable. Let us imagine that while uttering the definition, "man is a rational animal," we halt just after having said the word "is," and ask ourselves, "What is ... ?" The posing of this question in such a way might seem rather curious in that it is asked at a time when the definer is already on his way toward an- swering it; but the expression, "man is ... " is in itself some sort of statement - a statement which contains as its "verb" the copula "is," and which requires a "subject" to which that "verb" may refer. Just as ordinary verbs such as "walk" and "run" imply the presence of some entity which does the "walking" and "running," the copula "is" implies the pres- ence of something which can, so to speak, "do the being." Now, in our definition we cannot be saying that the word "man" is this something, that the word "man" is a rational animal; the question therefore arises, what does the definition say "is a rational animal?" - and our halting of the statement in mid-utterance is thus justified. Imagine that during a conversation some sudden noise blots out part of a statement your companion is making, so that you hear only "... is a slabsided baboon." Naturally, you would immediately feel the necessity of inquiring, " What is a slab-sided baboon?" Now imagine further that the beginning of his reply to your question is again blotted out, and that this</page><page sequence="5">238 Etcetera • Summer 1998 time he gets only as far as "... is a ..." before you quickly catch him up and, without waiting for the rest of his statement, ask again, "yes, but what did you say '... is a ...?"' In this second case he would have employed only the "is" of identity, and yet it would have been immediately clear that the "is" had been said of something - something which was necessary, and yet not present, and without which both the "is" and what followed it hung in the air, so to speak, and did not form a meaningful statement. It is this "something" which is missing in the definition, "Man is a rational animal," and as it stands, therefore, that definition is meaningless. Leonard Greenberg "The'Is' of Identity in Definitions" Every major political figure - every popular moviestar, for that matter - is some kind of "culture-hero," some kind of intimate personal symbol to the millions to whom he is known. Thus, Winston Churchill, at a time when England was on her knees, was a stern but wonderfully strong father- figure, to whom the bleeding children of England could turn for strength - and then return, still bloody, to the fight. When the war was over, they didn't need him any more. Franklin Roosevelt was also a father-figure - a kindlier one for a kindlier purpose during the Depression years - but still the Chief during the war. Woodrow Wilson was a censorious mother-schoolmarm, from whom we played hookey in favor of international and national irresponsibility under Harding - the drinking and poker-playing buddy with whom we had been forbidden to play. What sort of imaginative symbols were [Thomas] Dewey and Truman? Dewey, I believe, is (or rather was) a twentieth- century culture-hero - a symbol for something I am sure Freud did not name. He was the culture-hero of those whose life is with words and symbols - not with grain or iron or potatoes or soil, but with words about them : futures, notes,</page><page sequence="6">Retrospect 239 mortgages, organization charts, advertising campaigns, real estate promotion, newspapers. This class of owners, execu- tives, publishers, fashionable preachers, sales managers - the country club and suburban set - may be termed, for con- venience, the symbol manipulators. ... Dewey seems to have manufactured himself to order as a culture-hero for this class. We were given to understand that as a young man at the University of Michigan he was a B.M.O.C. [Big Man On Campus]. His vest was adorned with "activities keys." He had taken, and passed with honors, courses in Effective Speaking. Without making the mistake of becoming pious, he had paid homage to the correct gods by singing in a choir. His clothes were conservatively beautiful. He had a masterly way about him - the look of the Efficient Executive. The B.M.O.C. became, as is proper - the big man in life - efficient, hard-hitting, cool, and energetically on the make as every young man worth his salt should be. He (or his advisors) made him up to order as the embodiment of the executive class's ideal of an executive. A revealing fact is that most of the symbol-manipulating class didn't like Dewey. Executives and publishers and sub- urbanites are people, and as people they didn't warm up to Dewey any more than the working man did. But - and here is a major fact about American culture - the symbol- manipulating class does not consult its own likes and dislikes in its dealings with the public. They are accustomed, through the long discipline of salesmanship, to deciding what to say in an advertising campaign, what emotions to exploit in a movie, how to write a feature story, how to design a motor car, not on the basis of their own innermost tastes and reactions, but on the basis of "what the public wants." It is only because they have learned to shut their private ears that they have been able, for example, to flood the airwaves with the "sing- ing commercials" and "spot announcements" that, I am sure, reduce by 25 percent the potential radio audience. Bemused by the magic of appearances and symbols, they are the same class who have elevated "packaging" to a status almost more</page><page sequence="7">240 Etcetera • Summer 1998 important in trade than the manufacture of what goes into the package. Not accustomed to consulting their own feel- ings, they could see in Dewey only what everyone was sup- posed to see in him - the perfect, chromium-plated, halitosis-free, streamlined, cellophane-wrapped Man of Dis- tinction. And with that sales and promotion force behind him, they felt he couldn't miss. S. I. Hayakawa" Why Was Dewey Defeated?" Within the field of painting, abstract art serves an educa- tive function: it brings about the consciousness of form, by employing neutral elements of form, and pure colors which would not trammel the clarity of form. In his maturer art Mondrian consistently avoided any forms or compositions that might have given rise to anthropomorphic or naturalistic associations, as in cubism and surrealism. Art being essen- tially a matter of coherent form, purely formal or abstract art arouses the most direct perception and, at the same time, represents human experience in its most vital form. Abstract art can be considered as multi-dimensional ab- stracting. It abstracts the unchanging relations of the visual aspects of nature: volumes and planes determined by lines and colors. The critical insight developed in abstract art, the reviewer believes, parallels general semantics; and the theory of ab- stract art could be regarded as part of the theory of general semantics. We formulate the well-known principle of non- identity through the study and function of human linguistic behavior. The non-identity of art with "nature" is the core of abstract art, and the elimination of imitation and representa- tion is a working out of that principle. It is only when the imitative aspects of art are eliminated that we come to recog- nize the human significance of art: as involving orientations, modes of adaptation, silent assumptions. Just as the theory of</page><page sequence="8">Retrospect 241 general semantics can be considered as the logic of human scientific behavior, so also abstract art can be considered as the logic of human art-behavior. Abstract art brings out the significance of the visual environment, its assumptions and implications, which we usually neglect. According to Harry Holtzman, a foremost abstract artist of today and one who has developed a thorough formulation of its theories in gen- eral semantics terminology, "Piet Mondrian's art represents the most revolutionary contribution of our time to the histori- cal development of plastic perception in relation to reality. The vitality of his expression contains profound implications for our understanding of the past and future, as well as of the present.... Abstract art involves a denial of the elementalistic dichotomy between science and art; it reveals both as mutu- ally dependent forms of behavior, expressing orientations, attitudes, assumptions, of their period." Surindar S. Suri, Review of Plastic Art and Pure Plastic Art, and Other Essays, by Piet Mondrian. Edited by Harry Holtzman. Here is what we call in film a montage. It is a series of shots, that, seen in unbroken sequence, creates an impression in the viewer that no one of the shots by itself could. It's the piling- up of them that's the creative act, the act of montage. Mr. Dassin begins Naked City by blending together some of the following images: Air-shots of New York Dark street with church at the end, man crossing Inside of a bank, bright-lit, empty Theater stage, looking down from the gods, bright-lit, empty Inside of department store, bright-lit, empty Ship lying by dock Man lying in a porch, sleeping</page><page sequence="9">242 Etcetera • Summer 1998 Elevated train with lighted windows, creeping along its bridge bl-tr diagonal Looking down on the city with a dark plane in the fore- ground, its lights winking on and off, white on the black Man in a factory adjusting and oiling a machine Woman mopping up a large stone floor Linotype operators in a row fingering their keys Diskjockey hemmed in by his turntables Café, crowded with richly-dressed people Couple, sitting in some place of entertainment, interested in one another Here the context is given first, not in a single continuous movement of the camera, but in a series of impressions that fuse as they are seen one after the other.... The words in which film is discussed will depend on the context. If the place is the studio, the persons technicians, and the purpose composing a film, many words are used that won't be needed, words that might confuse, if the place were the sitting room, the persons filmgoers, and the purpose to exchange views of a film just seen. I have tried myself to find words that will help me as a filmgoer to discuss with others what we see on the screen, without considering the gear needed in shooting it. I find that knowledge of studio detail isn't needed at all to help me respond, or discuss my impressions with others. It's the final effect we are concerned with, however it came. The words used (and many I use are not as fit as they should be) must be elastic enough to cover gradations. The rough categories of close-up, medium, and long shots, must, where this can be done, be replaced by terms that give the relative size of objects. Numbers are the obvious means for this. But I have not yet found a single set of terms that will show by numbers the many directional relations of camera and object - whether the shot is up, down, low, or eye-level, and in what measure; or the many degrees of relative move-</page><page sequence="10">Retrospect 243 ment - whether the shot is retreating or approaching, mounted on and shooting the moving object, following or panning. Various numerical notations suggest themselves. I have often put in notes, "Camera 45° up." But it hardly seems proper to use so fine a calibration, when ten degrees either way is a likely error, and wouldn't make a tremendous amount of difference. And any set of terms used must make for ease of expression: discussion could lose its critical pur- pose by an encrustation of over-exact pseudo-measurement. For the film to do constructive work in society (and it only does a little of this today) its maker must have non-attached, objective, moral values. He must also use artistic means with exactness. Both values must be discussed and understood by as many filmgoers as possible, before producers can make films that are more constructive. Filmgoers are usually equipped with words to discuss the moral issues, of which they are more aware. And for this reason, a film with a fine moral intention is often seen by few: the maker either ig- nored artistic values, and his filmic means defeated his inten- tion, or he was sensitive beyond the common, and there were few with discernment enough to catch his nuances. A public that has the words to discuss the matter of a film and the way it is expressed, and does discuss them, is one for which no director can afford to make a bad film, and one for which he can't make a film that's too good. We need more amateur critics - theaters of them - people that can tell drivel when they see it; or better still, can tell the films not to see at all.
