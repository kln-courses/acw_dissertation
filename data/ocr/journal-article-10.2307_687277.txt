Altogether fifteen articles, pub- lished over the last two decades, are reprinted in the two books. The first volume, Physics and The Atomists contains a new summary and overview of the history of the kinetic theory and statistical mechanics; and the second volume contains an exhaustive bibliography of research papers in those and closely related fields for the period 80o x-Igoo. The first volume is primarily devoted to the contributions to, and criticisms of, the kinetic theory made by specific authors. Thus the contribution of Herapath, Waterston and Clausius to the elementary theory, the great theoretical innovations of Maxwell, Boltzmann and Van der Waals and the critical analysis of Mach each receive a chapter. The second volume Statistical Physics and Irreversible Processes treats of the problems and theories put forward to solve them, which made up the evolution of the kinetic theory and statistical mechanics in the nineteenth century. Thus the foundations of Statistical Mechanics, in particular equipartition and ergodicity, is treated in chapter io; atomic forces, the Van der Waals equation and the law of corresponding states in chapter I I, transport phenomena and the Boltzmann transport equation in * Review of BRUSH, S.

The first chapter in Volume II is devoted to the neglected topic of the wave theory of heat and the final chapter contains an illuminating analysis of the literature on the kinetic theory together with a bibliography of research publications. In this latter chapter Brush points out that growth in the literature neither in the kinetic theory nor physics, chemistry and mathematics combined 'fits the expoten- tial model very well' (p. 71 0). The two volumes are designed to serve a dual purpose. They will provide a useful collection of important secondary papers in a compact form for those scholars already familiar with Brush's work and will provide a clear, detailed account of some of the major developments in the field for those researchers not already familiar with the history of the kinetic theory. These two volumes contain some classics in 'internal' history (particularly chapters 6, Io and 14 on Boltzmann, Statistical Mechanics and Irreversibility) and provide generally an important secondary source for the development of the theory of matter and statistical physics in the nineteenth century. Indeed the two volumes are best read in conjunction with Brush's three volumes of collected primary papers in the kinetic theory.' Because a good number of the basic problems first formulated by Maxwell and Boltzmann, remain unsolved in full generality, much of the material on these problems is also relevant to current research both in physics (e.g. advanced transport theory, stochastic processes, the foundations of statistical mechanics and irreversi- bility, the ergodic theory, and some aspects of cosmology) and in philosophy (e.g. statistical explanation, instrumentalism and realism, reduction, theory of empirical support and scientific revolutions, the anisotropy of time and specific issues in the philosophy of physics). It would be quite inappropriate to attempt a discussion of all the areas covered in the volumes, nor are all of them philosophically significant; consequently detailed consideration will be given only to three conceptually important problem areas and their relation to more modern philosophical problems. These problem areas are: (i) the explanation of irreversibility and the interpretation of probability statements in classical physics; (2) the critique of atomism; and (3) the theory of fluctuations and Brownian motion. 2 IRREVERSIBILITY (a) The Problem In order to provide an adequate foundation for the theory of heat, the kinetic theory needed to provide an explanation or 'reduction' of the second law of thermodynamics. In its full version this law states that there is a function of state (the entropy) such that for all transformations of state occurring in nature, the total entropy of all the bodies taking part in the transformation SBrush [1965], [1966] and [1972).</page><page sequence="3">Matter, Motion and Irreversibility 167 increases. This is the statement of the irreversibility of all macroscopic processes occurring in nature. If the transformation is reversible (an ideal or limiting case) then the second law asserts that the entropy change is equal to the integral of the differential quantity dQ/ T (where dQ is the heat transferred and T the temperature at which it is transferred) from the initial to the final state. Thus the problem for the kinetic theory was to show that such a function of state (S) exists with the required properties, i.e. to explain the origin and source of entropic irreversibility.1 (b) Objective and Epistemic Probability Now the most important single conceptual innovation of the kinetic theory and the key to the problem mentioned above, is its employment of the theory of probability (and more generally statistical hypotheses) and this raises the important problem of how probability theory entered into physics.2 It is as well to note however that the probabilistic or statistical assumptions employed were very various: Clausius and Maxwell (in his first theory) employed an assumption about the relative probability of collisions (in fact the first form of the Stosszahlansatz, pp. 173-81 and pp. 229-42) in the theory of the mean free path and the calculation of the transport coefficients; Maxwell (in his second theory where the molecules are treated as centres of force, pp. 432-49) and Boltzmann employed explicitly statistical assump- tions concerning the lack of correlations in position and velocity of colliding molecules; Boltzmann employed the independent combinatorial methods of probability theory in his deduction of the law of 'S = k log W' and the theory of the most probable distribution (in effect the assumption that the points representing the molecules in position-velocity space are reshuffled randomly by collisions); while Gibbs employed an assumption of equal a priori weighting for equal regions of phase space in defining the probability metric for an ensemble or collection of macroscopically identical systems.3 Brush argues convincingly that the thermodynamic concepts of irreversibility and the dissipation of energy (embodied in the concept of entropy changes in the second law) actually arose historically in the geophysical context of the cooling of the earth, of the source of the earth's heat and the treatment of that problem using Fourier's theory by for example William Thomson (pp. 55 1-66). Brush treats of the development of pure thermodynamics up to and including Clausius's introduction of the entropy concept in the 'equivalence-value of a thermodynamic transformation' in 1854 and explicitly in 1865 (pp. 556-79). He gives a very clear account of the original argument for what we now call Clausius's theorem (viz in any cyclic transformation the inequality dQ/T &lt; o holds, pp. 574-5). Clausius's own original account of this central result is notoriously opaque. 2 Brush conjectures after Gillespie that Maxwell was probably influenced by Herschel's work on the law of errors (pp. I83-9). 3To this, by no means complete list, should be added the idea of Maxwell that a 'natural' probability measure could be found from mechanics by use of the ergodic hypothesis that 'a system if left to itself... will, sooner or later, pass through every phase which is consistent with the equation of energy' (p. 366), and Boltzmann's employment of an ensemble of systems all having the same energy but different values of the microscopic co-ordinates. Brush gives a very detailed account of the ergodic hypothesis in the work of Boltzmann and Maxwell (pp. 363-77) and corrects some of the historical and conceptual inaccuracies present in the famous account due to the Ehrenfests, (Ehrenfests [1911]). For the present state of the ergodic method in statistical mechanics, cf. Lavis ['977], PP. 267-90 and Farquhar [1964].</page><page sequence="4">168 Peter Clark The introduction of this plethora of concepts was made even more complicated by the realisation that the underlying motion of the molecules was governed by the laws of mechanics and was therefore deterministic in character.' The very general conceptual problem was therefore posed from the beginning (indeed independently of the special time asymmetry problem of the second law) as to how it could be consistent to add statistical assumptions to treat of an aggregate motion the component submotions of which, being governed by the laws of mechanics, were entirely de- terministic. As Brush points out certain statistical assumptions immediately violate classical mechanics; e.g. Maxwell's first assumption that the com- ponents of velocity of a single molecule are statistically independent (p. 587).2 Now according to Brush, both Clausius and Maxwell resolved the difficulty by appeal to the 'ignorance concept of probability' by which statistical assumptions hold merely in virtue of our ignorance as to the exact initial conditions obtaining when the motion of a large number of molecules is treated. But this of course does not resolve the problem at all, it merely reformulates it as: why is it that aggregate motion is such that even though we do not know the exact initial conditions for all the molecules we can consistently employ assumptions about them based upon our ignorance and obtain correct predictions?3 Only in Maxwell's later work in the I870s is there any suggestion and that only of the vaguest kind, that molecular velocities objectively, in nature, satisfy a statistical postulate. Perhaps the clearest statement occurs in his lecture to the Chemical Society of I875 (p. 592): The peculiarity of the motion called heat is that it is perfectly irregular; that is to say, that the direction and magnitude of the velocity of a molecule at a given time cannot be expressed as depending on the present position of the molecule and the time. In my view this physical hypothesis of randomness of molecular motion is essential to an explanation of irreversibility if that phenomenon is regarded as a physical fact independent of human observation. If the epistemic account of probability is employed and this concept is used to explain irreversibility it follows that irreversibility must be an epistemic property. This conclusion seems to have been embraced by Jaynes who remarks: 1 The general concept of determinism is somewhat vague (cf. particularly Montague [1 962], pp. 303-59). Nevertheless it's restriction to classical mechanics is clear. If the motion is described by Hamilton's Canonical equations then there is one and only one solution to the equations satisfying the complete specification of the positions and momenta at some given time. All past and future values of the positions and momenta are fixed for a given system by their specification at one time and the equations of motion, provided the system remains isolated. This condition will fail if the antecedent above is not satisfied (cf. particularly Prigogine [1980]). 2 In his second theory of 1867 Maxwell employed the assumption that the velocities of two colliding molecules, rather than the velocity components of a single molecule are statistically independent (Maxwell [1867]). 3 An attempt at an answer to this problem is provided by the so-called information theory approach to statistical mechanics. Cf. Shannon and Weaver [1949], Jaynes [i 957], Hobson [1971], and Reichenbach [1955], pp. I67-78.</page><page sequence="5">Matter, Motion and Irreversibility 169 It is of the greatest importance to recognise that in all this semi-classical theory it is possible to maintain the view that the system is at all times in some definite but unknown pure state . .. the probabilities represent only our ignorance as to the true state. With such an interpretation the expression 'irreversible process' represents a semantic confusion, it is not the physical process that is irreversible, but rather our ability to follow it. The second law of thermodynamics then becomes merely the statement that although our information as to the state of the system may be lost in a variety of ways, the only way it can be gained is by carrying out further measurements.' Despite Maxwell's leaning toward an objective account of randomness, it would appear that his mature view endorsed the purely epistemic viewpoint. Brush quotes him to this effect: Now confusion, like the correlative term order is not a property of material things in themselves, but only in relation to the mind which perceives them (p. 593). In the same article ('On Diffusion' for the Britannica) Maxwell refers to what is now called Gibbs's paradox concerning the entropy of mixing of different gases (in which case there is an entropy increase due to the irreversibility of mixing or diffusion) and identical gases (where there is reversible separation and no increase in entropy). This is, of course, a disastrous conclusion for it makes the thermodynamic entropy (of gas say) both a function of state and dependent on the history of the gas, which is impossible.2 Maxwell's argument can easily be carried over into classical mechanics, for there too in the mixing of identical gases there is an unwanted increase in entropy. This can be avoided by employing a different counting assumption in the computation of the value of W (the total number of microstates consistent with the given microstate) in the formula S = k log W. The corrected counting procedure amounts to regarding the particles of the gas as indistinguishable. However this procedure, which gives the right result for the entropy of an ideal gas (i.e. the Sackur-Tetrode equation) introduces into classical statistical mechanics the ad hoc hypo- thesis that in all considerations other than the counting of states the particles must be regarded as distinguishable while when counting states the particles must be regarded as indistinguishable. This is presumably the basis for the claim that Gibbs's paradox can only be resolved in a uniform way within quantum statistical mechanics in which interchanging the particles in the cells of the partitioned position--velocity space (which produces a new 1 Jaynes [1957], p. 171. There is a second though related sense in which it is possible to argue that the course grained entropy is a reflection merely of human ignorance as Griinbaum points out in consideration of Jaynes' argument-viz. 'that the occurrence and direction of a temporal change of the entropy S = k log W assigned to a given physical system depends essentially on our human choice of the size of the finite equal cells or boxes which partition the 6 dimensional position-velocity space'. However as Gruinbaum shows the statistics of entropy change for a very large class of standard partitions do in fact express partition invariant macroscopic physical facts and 'cannot be held merely expressive of human ignorance of the underlying microprocesses' (Gruinbaum [1973], PP. 646-65). 2 This the basis of Janes' claim that, 'Even at the purely phenomenological level, entropy is an anthropomorphic concept. For it is a property not of the physical system, but of the particular experiments you or I choose to perform on it' (Jaynes [19651, p. 398).</page><page sequence="6">17o Peter Clark microstate in classical mechanics) merely changes the wave function by at most a sign and does not produce a new state. However Gibbs's paradox, though a deep result, hardly impugns the existence of genuine irreversibility in nature.1 The point being that if we consider that macroscopic equilibrium is a genuine physical state, a conclusion which seems hardly avoidable, then objections to the coarse grained entropy (the modern form of Maxwell's argument) miss the point that the neglect of correlations among the parameters describing the molecular motions, made by assuming statistical postulates actually to hold, do describe that real macroscopic state and the approach to it correctly.2 It seems to me clear that once irreversibility is regarded as an objective physical phenomenon, which obtains in nature and which as such has nothing to do with human ignorance, it then follows that the epistemic concept of probability has no role in the interpretation of probability statements in classical statistical physics. It is important, however, to keep in mind that the statistical postulates employed in the kinetic theory proper and in the different research programme of statistical mechanics are distinct. Within the kinetic theory they may be understood as postulates about the distribution law for the velocities of a population of colliding molecules, e.g. that it is the product of the distribution laws for the individual groups of colliding molecules.3 Within statistical mechanics however, conditional probability statements of the form, the probability of finding the representative point of the system given that it has a certain energy within a given 'volume' of the energy surface is proportional to the volume of the given region, should be interpreted as referring to a measure defined on a suitable ensemble of systems. Both these interpretations however make no reference to human ignorance. (c) Boltzmann's Theory-an example of the importance of proof analysis in physics Brush's discussion of Boltzmann's statistical theory of entropy and the H- theorem is very extensive (pp. 235-48, 363-85, 598-640). It provides a clear historical account of the labrynthine discussions of Boltzmann's theory of the approach to equilibrium and of the explanation of irreversibility from the kinetic theory, the problem mentioned at the beginning of this section. Essentially Boltzmann's achievement was to obtain an integro-differential equation for the rate of change of the distribution function (f) of molecular velocities (he used molecular energy) with time. From this it followed that if 1 It is important to note as is brought out clearly by Brush (pp. 604-5) that Gibbs' famous remark in his paper 'On the equilibrium of heterogeneous substances' that 'the impossibility of an uncompensated decrease of entropy seems to be reduced to improbability' occurs precisely in the context of a discussion of the entropy of mixing (i.e. Gibbs' paradox) and is not connected with the statistical interpretation of dissipation of energy nor of irreversibility. That paper is of course a classic in phenomenological thermodynamics. 2 Cf. Davies [1976], PP. 76-8. 3 Cf.

So a sufficient condition for equilibrium is that molecular velocities satisfy the Maxwell law. To obtain a necessary condition for equilibrium Boltzmann had, as Brush puts it, 'the brilliant inspiration' to define the functional expression for what we now call H (Boltzmann actually uses E for this functional and formulates it using energy as the variable) which essentially has the form H(t) = fd3 vf (v, t) logf (v, t) for (v, t) the distribution function for velocities. Now when af/at is zero it follows upon differentiation of H(t) that dH/dt = o. So a necessary condition for equilibrium is that dH/dt = o. Boltzmann then showed that iff satisfies the original integro-differential equation (that is, f is such that the fundamental statistical postulate, the assumption of molecular chaos, is true) then analytically dH/dt &lt; o. It follows from this proof that dHfdt is identically zero when and only when the distribution is Maxwellian. So by the above, a necessary condition for equilibrium is that the distribution be Maxwellian. This is of course the H-theorem, viz: if the distribution is such that the fundamental statistical postulate is satisfied, then analytically dH/dt &lt; o. As Brush points out Boltzmann evaluated H (his E) for the Maxwell distribution and showed that it has the same form as the expression previously found for dQ/ T which is required for an explanation of the second law, as pointed out at the beginning of this section. Of course this explanation depends crucially upon the fundamental statistical postulate.1 Now as Brush informatively shows (pp. 6o2-6) essentially the statistical nature of the second law considered from the point of view of the kinetic theory had been pointed out by Maxwell, Thomson and Tait. Brush shows that, in particular, Thomson in 1874 in his paper 'On the Kinetic Theory of the Dissipation of Energy' had given a clear statement of what is now known as the reversibility paradox and had further shown that the kinetic theory leads to the prediction of spontaneous large scale departures from the equilibrium condition though with enormously low probability. This now very familiar objection states that since the underlying molecular motions are all governed by the laws of mechanics which are symmetric under time reversal there can be no analytic proof of an irreversible approach to equilibrium which employs only those laws.2 This objection precipitated the long sequence of, in effect, proof analyses of Boltzmann's theorem.3 This important example of proof analysis in theoretical physics lead to new 1 Boltzmann certainly seems to have played down the role of the statistical postulate in his 1872 paper for he remarks that the proof of the H-theorem 'prepared the way for an analytic proof of the second law in a completely different way from those previously investigated' (my italics). This concept of the H-theorem is of course completely undermined by the simple reversibility objection. 2 This point is put clearly by Mach: 'If one realises that an actual analogy of entropy increase in a purely mechanical system of absolutely elastic atoms does not exist, then one can hardly resist the conclusion that a violation of the Second Law without the help of a demon-must be possible if such a mechanical system were the actual basis of heat processes.' Quoted by Brush (p. 291). 3 For the importance of proof analysis in mathematics, cf. Lakatos [1976].</page><page sequence="8">172 Peter Clark results in statistical mechanics and to an overall increase in the empirical content of the kinetic theory, directly as a consequence of the examination of the steps in Boltzmann's reasoning. Boltzmann's first reply accepted the objection to the analytic proof but pointed out, somewhat, opaquely, that appeal to initial conditions was necessary in the proof. Not every initial condition could satisfy the statistical assumptions employed in the proof, but since there are 'very many more' initial states that lead to a decrease in H, than lead to an increase in the H the theorem has a statistical validity. It should be noted however that the sense of statistical validity here used is very different from that employed in his later analysis of the H-Curve for there is still for suitable initial conditions a monotonic decrease in H. There is a much more subtle version of the reversibility objection which Brush attributes to E. P. Culverwell, which he calls the 'reversibility objection to the H-theorem' (pp. 616-25) and which was formulated as a consequence of the detailed discussions of the H-theorem at the British Association meeting in 1894. (The point being simply that the H-theorem itself is time reversal invariant so how can it provide an explanation of irreversibility?) Boltzmann, in his famous letter in Nature to the 'British Wranglers' (as Brush puts it, p. 622), subsequently introduced the important qualitative account of the approach to equilibrium in the H- Curve (or graph of H with respect to time) in which any sense of the monotonic decrease of H was abandoned (i.e. the antecedent conditions of the theorem cannot always hold) and replaced it by the idea that the value of H must sometimes increase, nevertheless, 'the probability that H decreases is always greater than that it increases'. In my view this realisation that there is in no sense a monotonic decrease in H was a crucial advance in the kinetic theory's explanation of irreversibility. It is so precisely because if H is thought of as monotonically decreasing then all possibility of explaining fluctuation phenomena (like the Brownian motion) vanishes. Thus the analysis of Boltzmann's proof and its successive elaborations contributed not only to a clarification of the explanation of irreversibility but to an increase in the empirical content of the theory, viz: the prediction of the existence of fluctuations. This whole account of the behaviour of the H- Curve, however, was challenged directly in two brilliant papers by E. Zermelo. It was Zermelo's second paper which really highlighted the crucial problem. Zermelo claimed that the properties now attributed by Boltzmann to the behaviour of H over time were simply incompatible with the laws of mechanics. If (i) one assumes the initial value of H to be above the minimum value then H could equally well lie on a rising or falling segment of the curve and therefore could increase or decrease (provided H is not at a local peak); (ii) Not every value of H above the minimum can possibly be a local peak (this is mathematically self-contradictory) and (iii) if we want irreversibility we can only obtain it by employing the unprovable (because untrue) assumption that the molecular state of gas is always, in Boltzmann's</page><page sequence="9">Matter, Motion and Irreversibility 173 expression, 'disordered'. Boltzmann's reply to (i) and (ii) was, as Brush remarks (p. 635), to insist that most parts of the H-Curve above its minimum are maxima, even though he admits that this cannot be literally true. The point here could I think be put like this (it is essentially due to the Ehrenfests): by the symmetry under time reversal of mechanics, we have that if the assumption of molecular chaos (or 'disorder') is satisfied then H must be at a local peak; however molecular collisions very rapidly create and destroy the conditions necessary and sufficient for molecular chaos to obtain (i.e. create and destroy correlations among molecular velocities) hence if H is above its minimum value and not at a peak, very very rapidly, because of collisions, the conditions of molecular chaos will be attained, then H will be at a local peak and will subsequently decrease over the next instant. The point being that H really changes in discrete jumps. Hence, neither the 'only if' claim nor the 'always' claim of Zermelo's (iii) is correct.1 In the following section the important historical and philosophical problem of the objections to atomism and Brush's commentary upon it is examined. 3 THE THEORY OF MATTER AND THE OBJECTIONS TO ATOMISM It is perhaps worth pointing out from the beginning that the critique of atomism in the last decades of the nineteenth century should not be over- dramatised. Very few opponents of the kinetic programme argued that it should be abandoned in the sense of no longer being worked on. The majority of those opponents (including Mach and Ostwald in their less polemical writings) were content to point to weaknesses within the theory, to try to find the source of the problems and to advocate new independent approaches, not dependent upon hypotheses about molecular mechanics. Indeed given the difficulties faced by the programme it would have been remarkable if critical comment had not reached the level it did. It must be recalled that the vast majority of working scientists in the late nineteenth century were 'atomists' of various sorts including some of those who wrote critically about it. Quite contrary to Boltzmann's melodramatic assertions to the effect that he saw himself as 'an individual struggling weakly against the stream of time';2 and explanations of the publication of his Lectures on Gas This fact guarantees the consistency of the statistical assumption with the laws of mechanics and answers Zermelo's point concerning the fact that the assumption of molecular disorder cannot be true at all instants of time. Where the difficulty lies is to show that, in the approach to equilibrium the most probable or most likely value of dH/dt is less than zero. To do this appeal must be made to what is now called the generalised H-theorem and the time evolution of the coarse-grained entropy. This was attempted by the Ehrenfests in their [x 9 x I ]. There is a very clear exposition of the statistical H-theorem as now understood in Davies [1976], pp. 29-79. 2 Boltzmann [ x 896], p. 2 x 6.</page><page sequence="10">174 Peter Clark Theory as an attempt to ensure that the record of the work of Claussius, Maxwell, and himself, should be preserved and available to those who should show new interest in the subject when the adverse tide of opinion that he could not stem had passed away,1 Boltzmann's work continued to be at the centre of research and critical analysis. At the Halle conference in 1891 there was a detailed discussion of the Boltzmann-Maxwell theory; in 1894 at the British Association meeting in Oxford, Boltzmann's theory was the centre of discussion and again at the famous meeting of the Naturforschergesellschaft at Liibeck in 1895. Further in 1899 and 1904 major new textbooks in the kinetic theory appeared in England by S. H. Burbury and by James Jeans, Meyer's textbook went through a second revised edition and was translated into English. The 189os saw a host of publications in kinetic theory, some of them being classic publications in the field especially in the crucial problem area of irreversi- bility by the 'British Wranglers' (p. 622). As can be seen from table 16 (p. 711) of Brush's analysis of the literature of the kinetic theory, the decade 189o-1900 saw the publication of nearly forty per cent of all papers published in the kinetic theory proper from 18oi-I9oo. Clearly then this period was not one of anything approaching universal dismissal and rejection of scientific atomism. What is true however, is that in that decade the kinetic programme underwent highly critical scrutiny in which it was found wanting in a number of respects. This opposition to atomism has been incorrectly-treated as a consequence of philosophical prejudice. For example, Brush remarks in an influential article: Those scientists who did suggest that the kinetic theory be abandoned in the later Nineteenth Century did so not because of empirical difficulties, but because of a more deep seated, purely philosophical objection. For those who believed in a positivist methodology, any theory based upon invisible and undetectable atoms was unacceptable. 2 In fact however opposition to the programme was based upon four problem areas; first the problem of irreversibility and the statistical account of the second law of thermodynamics; second the problem of specific heats and its relation to the emission and absorption spectra of gases; third, an interpre- tation of the methods of thermodynamics and fourth certain epistemological considerations adduced therefrom.3 Since the first of these has already been treated only the remaining three points will be briefly discussed here. With the benefit of hindsight it is extremely easy to underestimate the significance of the well-known problem of the anomalous specific heat ratios. The problem posed was not simply that observed specific heat ratios ' Chapman [1966], p. 260. 2 Brush [1974], p. 1169. 3 I argued in my [ 976] and [1977] that many of the objections to the kinetic theory should not be attributed to philosophic prejudice, but to the scientific situation at the time.</page><page sequence="11">Matter, Motion and Irreversibility 175 failed to agree with the predicted value but that on very general dynamical grounds (the existence of degrees of freedom of vibration, the continuous nature of energy transfer, the existence of intra-molecular collisions) molecular mechanics could not be reconciled with the fundamental theorem of the equipartition of energy. That is that the natural way to resolve the experimental refutations, viz. to take into account more and more of the degrees of freedom of the molecule lead away from, rather than towards the observed values.1 Though various molecular models succeeded in obtaining agreement with the observed facts, it was clear that they were ad hoc solutions, for it was merely laid down that certain degrees of freedom, though present, did not take up their due proportion of thermal energy, a fact totally inexplicable on classical grounds, as was pointed out by Maxwell, Kelvin, and Rayleigh and Gibbs. This was then a persistent and deep problem (involving the underlying mechanics) for the kinetic theory. In my view a third and crucial, but often overlooked component in the critique of atomism, was the research tradition of pure thermodynamics. This was not seen as a rival to atomism in the sense that the wave and particle theories of light were seen as rival accounts of light, but rather as a rival in the sense of carrying along with the first and second laws a very different set of heuristic techniques and procedures for extending and elaborating theories and of obtaining new results.2 Kelvin, Planck and Gibbs par- ticularly employed the special techniques of thermodynamics with enorm- ous empirical success. Ostwald and Duhem both of whom made considerable contributions to thermodynamics and thermochemistry were greatly influenced in their epistemological thinking by thermodynamic methods. Ostwald argued that scientific theories have to satisfy two requirements; they should exhibit functional dependencies among measurable, experimentally determinable quantities and second they should provide a general law from which special laws referring to particular systems follow as special cases.3 Duhem's account of the true nature of physical theory as being solely 'representative', that is providing a classification of experimental laws and making no attempt 1 This was the basis of the claim in my [1976] that the kinetic programme in the late Nineteenth Century was degenerating heuristically. Brush gives a detailed account of the problems (pp. 353-63) but fails to see I think the extent of the difficulty in his overall appraisal of the programme. 2 For details see my [1977], pp. ioo-i I, i6o-8o, 227-79. 3 Cf. Ostwald [1892] and [1895]. As is well known Ostwald and Helm among others sort to replace thermodynamics by the science of 'energetics' according to which the ultimate constituent of the World was 'energy' and that the two laws could be understood as expressing changes in the 'intensity' and 'capacity' factors into which all transformations of energy could be decomposed. Planck and Boltzmann pointed out a number of logical difficulties with this conception. However it should not be dismissed for it was the first systematic scientific criticism of the sharp partition present in classical physics but abandoned in modern physics between matter and energy. From a relativistic viewpoint the law of the conservation of mass is reduced to the law of the conservation of energy, and energy and inertia are found strictly proportional to one another. In this sense modemrn physics has vindicated Ostwald's insight that the so-called primary qualities of a body-mass and inertia are directly related to, and can be inter-converted into the energy of that body.</page><page sequence="12">176 Peter Clark to describe the reality underlying the phenomena is perfectly exhibited by fully fledged phenomenological thermodynamics. The two laws provided a classification of all the particular empirical laws connecting heat and work, no matter what the source of the latter, and the empirical laws of chemical equilibria. 1 Mach's opposition to atomism is carefully treated by Brush (pp. 274-99). His main contribution to the study of Mach is his careful documentation of the evolution of Mach's views on atomism. There were basically three stages in this evaluation: his early pro-atomism and employment of the elementary theory in his textbook for medical students (pp. 282-3); the anti-atomistic arguments of his classic study of the law of the conservation of energy (pp. 285-7), the subsequent scattered remarks on the atomic hypothesis (pp. 290-6) and his continuing late scepticism over both relativity and atomism. In respect of his argument against atomism, his objections can be summarised under three headings: (a) In its later development the versions of the atomic hypothesis violated the principle of the economy of thought. (b) In certain specified circumstances it was an obstacle to physical enquiry. (c) It relies upon the notion of 'substance' which introduces unnecessary problems for there is no reason why purely theoretical items like atom and molecule should be inter-related in the way that ordinary objects of sensations are. Scientists are caught in a dilemma: they insist molecules are real physical objects but to maintain this thesis they must endow those objects with properties which contradict the known properties of bodies.2 Mach's position on atomism in summary could best be described as an argument to the effect that the atomic theory may constitute a temporary contribution to the economy of thought but because of the problems it faces, it must not be regarded as anything approaching the only line of research (in particular the methods of pure thermodynamics provide an independent method of investigation). Of course Mach in the end was proved wrong, but this argument cannot be attributed to a dogmatic, philosophical prejudice. In summary then, three important aspects of the objections to the kinetic programme should be noted: first, the importance of the appraisal of the heuristic techniques embodied in theories and second, the systematic failure to produce a uniform non ad hoc account of molecular interactions (the specific heat problem and general dynamics) and third, the persistent problem over the kinetic theories 'explanation' of the Second Law. Indeed, 1 Duhem [i886] and [1906], pp. 93-9. 2 Cf. Mach [1872], pp. 50-1. He makes a similar anti-Kantian statement in his 'Essay on Space and Geometry' that theoretical physics need not assume that all concepts employed must conform to principles which purportedly govern our experience. Cf. Mach [1883], p. 589 and Mach [ 1906], p. 138. Brush in an apposite comment notes that there are no simple mechanical interpretations for many of the properties of matter found in twentieth century physics (p. 286). Mach's famous argument that the conservation of energy law does not prove that heat is not a substance is considered in detail in my [1977], PP. I3 I-60. This argument is a classical example of the instrumentalist thesis concerning the interpretation of the laws of nature.</page><page sequence="13">Matter, Motion and Irreversibility 177 given the difficulty over the specific heat problem it is difficult to see how a realistic interpretation of the theory of the molecule could be maintained. Two aspects of the kinetic theory's treatment of the second law had not, however, been investigated in detail, viz. Boltzmann's combinatorial theory of entropy and the possibility of fluctuation phenomena and the statistical methods for investigating them. The first was taken up by Planck and played an important role in the genesis of the quantum theory,1 and the second, which had eventually so profound an effect upon the appraisal of the kinetic programme, was developed independently by Einstein and Smoluchowski. 4 THE BROWNIAN MOTION AND STOCHASTIC PROCESSES Brush devotes chapter 15 of volume i i to the work of Einstein, Smoluchowski and Perrin on the Brownian Motion. There are four inter- related issues connected with the Brownian motion. They are: (i) why did the Brownian motion, which had been brought to the attention of the scientific community by the late 82zos, require nearly three quarters of a century before its character and significance were properly understood? (ii) What relations do the different theories of Einstein and Smoluchowski have to the problem of the limitation of validity of the second law?-we shall see that a number of influential accounts of this relation are in error here; (iii) Why was the theoretical analysis of the motion and its experimental confirmation so important in the scientific community's acceptance of the molecular kinetic theory and adoption of a realist interpretation of atomic theories? The simple answer to problem (i) is lack of an adequate quantitative theory. In the early history of the motion all manner of vague physical explanations were considered. Brush provides a comprehensive account of these theories (pp. 663-7). No suggestion that the motion might be explained using the kinetic theory occurred until a paper in 1879 by Karl Niigeli and then only to dismiss the idea. Essentially Nageli employed the elementary kinetic theory to calculate the effect of a single impact between a Brownian particle and a molecule of the surrounding gas (air). Such an impact would confer on the much more massive Brownian particle only a minute velocity. He noted that of course millions of such collisions would occur per second over the surface of the Brownian particle, but, employing an averaging assumption to the effect that the collisions occur from all spatial directions, he argued they would on average cancel out and exhibit a net resultant zero force on the particle. (There are two fallacious steps in Naigeli's argument, the first is his appeal to the observed velocity of the Brownian particles, a mistake first highlighted by Einstein's theory, the second in his averaging assumption, its fallacious application to the Brownian motion was first pointed out in Smoluchowski's theory.) 1 Cf. especially Kuhn [1978], pp. 92-134.</page><page sequence="14">178 Peter Clark (a) The Brownian Motion and The Second Law According to Brush (p. 670), it was the French Physicist Gouy who was the first to point out that the Brownian motion was a phenomenon of thermal equilibrium and that as such it constitutes a case of the performance of work (by an individual particle) the only effect being that heat, from a medium in thermal equilibrium, is converted into work performed against the resist- ance to motion of the surrounding fluid. As such, the motion is incompatible with the absolute second law of thermodynamics. Guoy's argument has the following form: Whatsoever idea one may have as to the cause that produces [the movement], it is no less certain that work is expended on these particles, and one can conceive a mechanism by which a portion of this work might become available. Imagine for example, that one of these solid particles is suspended by a thread of diameter very small compared to its own, from a rachet wheel; impulses in a certain direction make the wheel turn, and we can recover the work. This mechanism is clearly unrealistic but there is no theoretical reason to prevent it from functioning. This argument for recovering the work is however not correct, and the last statement is false. There is a theoretical reason preventing the functioning and it is that whatever mechanism is employed to guarantee net irreversi- bility of the turning of the wheel some damping mechanism must be employed in the rachet to prevent spontaneous fluctuations in the rachet mechanism reversing the motion of the wheel. This damping mechanism will generate heat. Once equilibrium obtains the Brownian motion of the rachet (and wheel) mechanism will exactly balance the Brownian motion induced by the particles, and the wheel will not turn. This result is proved by Feynman (Feynman, Leighton and Sands [1963], PP. 46-I, 46-9). The point is that although the motion of a single Brownian particle is inconsistent with the Second Law there is no way in which that inconsistency can be utilised to generate a net amount of utilisable (or available) work. This fact has an important consequence viz. that despite what is often said it is incorrect to regard the Brownian motion as an instance of a perpetual motion machine of the second kind, if such a machine is thought to be one whose only net effect is to abstract heat from a source of uniform temperature and convert it into an amount of utilisable work. Consequently since the motion of the Brownian particles in a medium in thermal equilibrium is incompat- ible with the second law, it cannot be the case that that law is equivalent to the exclusion of perpetual motion of the second kind as usually interpreted. In my view this constitutes an important example of the incorrectness of regarding the content of the Second Law as exhausted by some statement making reference only to the outcome of experiments we might be able to perform (e.g. the production of work utilisable or available to us), i.e. as expressing certain limitations as to knowledge of physical processes in principle attainable by humans. Nevertheless Gouy (and Poincare who took up his ideas (pp. 670--)) did raise the problem first of the bearing of the motion on the absolute validity of</page><page sequence="15">Matter, Motion and Irreversibility 179 the Second Law. Boltzmann and Maxwell, if they knew about the motion at all, missed its significance. The explanation would appear to be that they were both concerned with showing that the second law could be obtained as a limiting case in statistical mechanics and in particular that experimentally that limiting case would always be realised, so that statistical mechanics could be employed to show why it was that the phenomenological second law was always satisfied observationally. Thus the physical significance of fluctuation phenomena, whose existence follows directly from the statistical considerations embodied particularly for example in Boltzmann's treatment of the approach to equilibrium using the H-theorem, was overlooked. It was Einstein's theory which provided the decisive breakthrough in the understanding of the Brownian motion. Einstein was concerned to find facts which would provide decisive evidence for the atomic theory. As Brush shows Einstein's own development of statistical mechanics, dated from 1902, was designed to be sufficiently general to apply to the three states of matter and to radiation while having the explicit purpose of connecting mechanics and the theory of matter and radiation with thermodynamics. Since Einstein's theory is very well known and Brush gives a very clear account of it (pp. 672-84), I will concentrate here only on the important problem of the relation between that theory and the second law. Einstein's theory essentially considers the motion of the particles as exhibiting a dynamic equilibrium between an irregular force generated by fluctuations in the random bombardment of the particles by the molecules of the surrounding fluid (the net effect of which is the same as if the particles were diffusing through the surrounding medium), and a viscous force due to the resistance of the fluid which acts on the individual particle and retards its motion through the fluid. The key to the problem (and Einstein was the first physicist along with, but independently of, Smoluchowski to see this) was to treat the motion of a single particle as a stochastic process, in particular as a Markov process. That is, one in which the behaviour of a physical parameter f(x, t) (the displacement of a particle from its initial position at different times) is such that the behaviour at t + At depends only on the value taken by f at t, in particular on no earlier values off. Further when treating of the set of particles, each particle is assumed to execute its motion independently of the others. These two assumptions lead immediately to Einstein's famous displace- ment law that the root mean square displacement of the particles is proportional to the square root of the time of observation. This law provides an explanation of the failure to verify the mean square velocity of a suspended particle as given by the equipartition theorem. It was this which so bedeviled earlier attempts (Niigeli, Exner) to employ the kinetic theory as an explanation of the motion. The reason is provided by Einstein's displacement law. If we set (v2)1/2 = (x2)1/2/t then since (x2)'/2 = (2Dt)1/2 we obtain (v2)1/2 as inversely proportional to (t)1/2. Hence as t, the time of observation decreases, (v2)1/2 increases without limit. As Einstein remarked</page><page sequence="16">i80 Peter Clark Since an observer operating with definite means of observation in a definite manner can never perceive the actual path traversed in an arbitrarily small time, a certain mean velocity will always appear to him as an instantaneous velocity. But it is clear that the velocity ascertained thus corresponds to no objective property of the motion under investigation--at least, if the theory corresponds to the facts.' This first part of Einstein's theory consists of an argument as to how the reversible mechanism of molecular mechanics, that is the fluctuations in the collisions of fluid molecules with the Brownian particles, can, when averaged, yield a motion governed by the macroscopic irreversible diffusion equation. The remaining part of the theory concerns a second aspect treated entirely independently of the diffusive motion of the particles, that is the generation of an 'osmotic' pressure by the particle suspension. Einstein argued, and the claim is repeated by Brush (pp. 674-5), that on the basis of classical phenomological thermodynamics a collection of suspended particles in thermal equilibrium with their surrounding fluid should not exert any force on a semipermeable membrane placed in the liquid. On the basis of the kinetic theory, however, because the suspended particles are just like molecules of a dissolved substance in solution (differentiated from the latter class merely by their size) they must produce the same osmotic pressure as the same number of molecules in solution.2 The central claim here is that according to the classical theory of thermodynamics we would not expect to find an osmotic pressure on the partition. It was therefore somewhat surprising to find in the excellent and highly influential account of Statistical Mechanics by Huang the claim that: on purely thermodynamic grounds there is no way to answer the question 'Does a suspension of small particles in water exert osmotic pressure?' To answer this question we would have to form a definite opinion concerning the constitution of matter.3 But this claim, if true, is remarkable for it suggests that we can only recognise that the second law is refuted by the existence of an osmotic pressure generated by a suspension of particles provided that we have already accepted a rival account of heat viz. the atomic-kinetic theory. This claim is clearly related to a thesis of Feyerabend to the effect that a 'direct' refutation of the second law that considers only the phenomenological theory and the 'fact' of Brownian motion is impossible. 1 Einstein [1907], p. 67. Brush comments perceptively on the importance of Einstein's displacement law that, 'It is for just this reason that all the efforts of experimentalists, who knew nothing more of kinetic theory than the equipartition theorem, had failed to lead to any definite conclusion about the average speeds of colloidal particles. They were simply measuring the wrong thing until Einstein pointed out that only the ratio of mean square displacement to time could be expected to have any theoretical significance. One can hardly find a better example in the history of science of the complete failure of experiment and observation, unguided (until 19o05) by theory, to unearth the simple laws governing a phenomenon' (pp. 682-3). 2 Einstein [i90o51, PP. 2-3. 3 Huang [1963], PP. 5 I-2z.</page><page sequence="17">Matter, Motion and Irreversibility 18 1 His point is that we can only recognise the Brownian motion as a refutation of the second law given that we have already accepted the account of that motion given by the kinetic theory. According to him, in the absence of the kinetic theory one cannot regard the observational characteristics of the Brownian motion as inconsistent with the absolute second law taken together with a statement to the effect that the particles are in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding fluid medium. This thesis, if correct, would clearly undermine Einstein's claim that one observable property of colloidal suspensions, the existence of an osmotic pressure, is inconsistent with the second law. As Laymon, Worrall and myself have pointed out however, Feyerbend's claim is incorrect,1 for clearly if the particles are in thermal equilibrium with their fluid environment then the net performance of work against the resistance of the fluid, when a single particle moves away from its equilibrium position2 constitutes a transformation whose only final effect is to convert into work, heat extracted from a source at uniform temperature throughout, which is incompatible with the second law. A difficulty remains however, because even given that it can be experimentally determined that the particles are locally in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding fluid, it is surely beyond experimental capability to ensure that the only final effect of the transformation is to have converted some of the heat in the fluid into work (though of course on molecular kinetic grounds this is precisely the case). Hence the immense simplicity achieved by Einstein's idea. The existence of an osmotic pressure is directly de- terminable experimentally or may be obtained via an equivalent of it in this case, namely the exponential decay of the atmosphere of the Brownian particles with height when the suspension of particles is placed in a gravitational field. (Indeed the simplest and most elegant of Perrin's experiments were designed to test for the 'barometric' law of expotential decay of concentration with height, p. 696.) Thus it seems to me that from the point of view of the refutation of the absolute second law of thermody- namics the simplest case is given by Einstein in his first paper of 1905, provided it is indeed true, as he claims, that according to the second law, we would not expect to find an osmotic pressure generated by a suspension of particles, a claim denied by Huang. However, I shall argue that Einstein is correct here. According to classical thermodynamics the source of osmotic pressure is the increase of entropy which results from the mixing of the solvent and the solute. Thus the total 1 Laymon [I977], Worrall [I978] and Clark [19771, pp. 280-303. In fact the point is made directly by Perrin ([19131, P. 87). 2 Thus for example if oc is the position of the centre of gravity of a suspended particle of spherical form in a homogeneous liquid, then according to the second law, at equilibrium a should assume a fixed value. As Einstein remarked in this second paper on the Brownian motion 'Suppose that a is a measurable parameter of a physical system in thermal equilibrium, and assume that the system is in the so-called neutral equilibrium for every (possible) value of 0. According to classical thermodynamics, which differentiates between heat and other kinds of energy, spontaneous alterations of a cannot occur; according to the molecular theory of heat, it is otherwise' (Einstein [190o6], p. zo20).</page><page sequence="18">x8z Peter Clark entropy (and consequently free energy) of the solution consists of the entropy of the solvent, of the solute, plus an entropy of mixing. But mixing on thermodynamic grounds consists in the mutual diffusion of solute and solvent. The point is best seen in the mixing of two ideal gases, where their mutual irreversible diffusion generates the extra entropy of the mixing term. The entropy of the mixing term carries the dependency of the entropy (and thus the free energy) in the case of solutions upon the position of the semipermeable membrane (i.e. the partition) and the 'position' of the dissolved molecules. Now in the case of a suspension, employing the second law, the particles must assume their position of neutral equilibrium once thermal equilibrium is obtained, from which of course, they cannot fluctuate. This steady state rules out diffusion of the suspended particles through the fluid. As such the entropy of the suspension cannot contain an entropy of mixing term (which arises solely from irreversible diffusion) and therefore the entropy (and consequently the free energy) must be in- dependent of the position of the partition. Consequently whatever its exact form, the free energy function cannot give rise to an osmotic pressure. So according to the absolute second law, a suspension like the Brownian one cannot generate an osmotic pressure. In the case of statistical mechanics however, it follows directly from the assumption that the movement of single particles are independent of one another that a small osmotic pressure is developed by the immersed particles performing the motion. The second part of Einstein's theory employs this fact together with Stokes's law to compute the diffusion coefficient occurring as the factor of proportionality in the displacement law. Einstein's theory of the Brownian motion however does not really show exactly how the fluctuations in the bombardment of the Brownian particle can generate a net force on the particle (rather it assumes that it does) and further the motions are treated using statistical mechanics and not by detailed consideration, using the methods of the kinetic theory, of the mechanics of collisions. These two problems were resolved by Smoluchowski's theory published in 90o6 and Brush provides a detailed and informative treatment of this theory upon which most modern treatments are ultimately based (pp. 686-93).1 The sensitive experimental work of Perrin and his pupils as well as the independent investigations of Seddig and Svedberg finally resulted in the confirmation of the two theories of colloidal statistics. Perrin is perhaps most well known for his dedicated experimental work, but as we learn from Brush 'Cf. especially Smoluchowski [19o8], and Chandrasekhar [1943], pp. 46-56. Modern theories of the Brownian motion are based upon the stochastic differential equation (i.e. one which has a probability distribution as its solution) due to Langevin, i.e.-du/dt = -flu + A(t) where u denotes the velocity of a particle, - flu the viscous frictional damping and A(t) the fluctuating driving force resulting from the molecular bombardment. Solutions to the equation are probability distributions for the occurrence of velocity u at time t. The evolution of the probability density function with time is given by the Fokker-Planck equation. Cf. particularly, Langevin [x19o8], Uhlenbeck and Ornestin [1x9301, Chandrasekhar [x9431, PP- 3 x-4x.</page><page sequence="19">Matter, Motion and Irreversibility 183 and Nye, already in 19o6 he had independently spotted the significance of the Brownian motion and had given a qualitative account of the 'osmotic pressure' developed by the suspended particles and suggested that the motion presented direct evidence of the invalidity of the absolute second law (pp. 639-70I).1 (c) Instrumentalism and the Brownian Motion As is now well known the effect of the confirmation of Einstein and Smoluchowski's theories of the Brownian motion was decisive in the appraisal of the kinetic molecular programme and of that of statistical mechanics. Ostwald, Planck, Nernst, Arrhenius and Poincare all remark on the motion, as interpreted by Einstein and Smoluchowski, as showing both that matter is discrete, particulate and 'atomic' and that in the motion we have direct access to the 'lower limits' of validity of the second law and that the two theories constitute very good evidence for the importance of the application of statistical methods in physics. Now Brush points out that in many ways it is somewhat surprising that the theory had so profound an effect on the appraisal of the kinetic-molecular programme. He remarks (p. 697): In fact, the willingness of scientists to believe in the 'reality' of atoms after 19o8, in contrast to previous insistence on their 'hypothetical' character is quite amazing. The evidence provided by the Brownian-movement-experiments of Perrin and others seems rather flimsy, compared to what was already available from other sources. The fact that one could determine Avogardo's number and the charge on the electron by one more method seems hardly sufficient to justify such profound metaphysical conclusions. Several independent methods of determining these parameters had been known since i870 or before, to say nothing of the many successes of kinetic theory in predicting the properties of gases. However the effect is not really 'amazing' at all if we consider what the Einstein-Smoluchowski achieved. First the theory provided the setting for a 'crucial' experiment, one which resulted in a direct refutation of the absolute second law. In so far as the great empirical success of the second law was seen to underpin a particular epistemological and methodological approach to scientific explanation and the proper interpretation of scientific theories (e.g. the instrumentalist theories of Ostwald, Poincare and Duhem) in general a phenomenological account, the falsity of the Second Law and the complete inability of thermodynamic methods to explain the motion removed a major prop of that methodological account. It was the kinetic theory despite its more 'hypothetical' foundations which had in the end provided a much deeper understanding of thermal equilibrium. Secondly, the Einstein-Smoluchowski theory provided very deep insight into a general theoretical problem, viz. the problem of how reversible motions might generate irreversible phenomena. Third, the confirmation of the Einstein-Smoluchowski displacement law provided new evidential 1 Cf. Nye [1972].</page><page sequence="20">184 Peter Clark support for the atomic-kinetic programme as well as providing more accurate methods, as Brush notes, for the determination of molecular parameters like Avogadro's and Loschmidt's numbers. Fourth and most importantly however, the theory provided a complete analogy between solutions and suspensions. Now what is it that differentiates the two? It is that in the latter case the matter in suspension is observable while in the former case it is not. Thus there appears to be a dramatic difference between the two cases, especially so if it is argued that the terms occurring in scientific theories should make reference only to observationally determinable quantities. Yet the Einstein-Smoluchowski theory shows that this distinc- tion is artificial; for solutions and suspensions (at least 'ideal' ones) obey exactly the same law (viz. Van't Hoff's law) and that the underlying mechanism generating the mixing, viz. diffusion is the same in both cases. Given the above points it seems to me hardly surprising at all that working scientists adopted a belief in the 'reality' of atoms. Of course there was by 191 o considerable further evidence concerning the discontinuity of matter and radiation and a gradual realisation of the physical significance of the quantum discontinuity of energy exchange.1 However, it is important to note that although scientists did embrace the particulate molecular conception of matter wholeheartedly, that acceptance did not constitute return to the 'classical' atom of Boltzmann and Maxwell. Rather it introduced a new problem, namely whether or not it was possible to give a realist interpretation of the emerging quantum theory of the atom. 5 This review has concentrated on only three aspects of general conceptual interest in these two volumes. It in no way does justice to the immense amount of material therein. Other areas of particular interest are the decline of caloric theory and the wave theory of heat (pp. 303-34), the successive transport theories and the discussion of the advanced theory of Chapman and Enskog (pp. 422-68) and the theory of phase-transitions, so important in the history of the kinetic theory, of Van der Waals (pp. 249-73 and 406-16). These two volumes constitute a great achievement in the history of nineteenth-century science and provide an important source for those philosophers, historians and physicists who wish to learn from the intellectual evolution of a major and revolutionary branch of theoretical science.
