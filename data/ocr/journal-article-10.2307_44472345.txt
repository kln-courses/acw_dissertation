Culver, and Edward Jędrzejczak Biomedical Science Dept. General Motors Research Labs. ABSTRACT The purpose of this study was to replace the axial deforming elements in the current EUROSID dummy with spring steel ribs and attached damping material to provide improved biofidelity in the lateral chest impact response. This report provides a description of the design, construction, and evaluation of the modified EUROSID chest for injury assess- ment in side impact crashes. Three spring steel ribs were designed to provide stiffness and deflections of 120 mm when attached to the block on the spine of the EUROSID dummy. Damping material was epoxied to the ribs and the system provided biofidelity in the lateral impact response for blunt impact loading at 4.3 m/s and 6.7 m/s. The new design provides significantly reduced inertia of the near side rib cage, elastic and viscous proper- ties that are representative of the lateral human response and the ability to measure the deflection response of the rib cage for injury assessment with the Viscous response. Testing has shown that the modified design has biofi- delity and can be used for injury assessment of side interior modifications for occupant pro- tection. BIOFIDELITY IN THE F ORCE- DEFLECTION response of an anthropomorphic test device is important to the ultimate introduction of improvements in the side interior of passenger cars to reduce injury risks in lateral impacts (1-3) . Pendu- lum impact tests on the DOTSID dummy (4) have indicated less than optimum performance charac- teristics of the device because of an excessive nearside rib mass of approximately 9.1 kg and because the rib cage pivots about the spine rather than deflecting under load. These char- acteristics cause the DOTSID to crush safety- improving padding by an excessive inertial force developed in the early phase of impact and make it unsuitable for side impact design improvement strategies. Similar tests with the EUROSID (5) have also demonstrated high inertial forces at con- tact, and in addition, sensitivity to small changes in the axis of impact from a pure- lateral direction of loading. Again, the near- side rib mass is greater than human-like (8.9 kg) and the off-axis sensitivity is a result of axial deforming elements in the chest that provide the spring and dashpot resistance. In contrast to DOTSID and EUROSID, the human response for pendulum impact tests under similar conditions have a much lower plateau force and higher relative deflection between the impacted rib cage and the opposite side. Grouped response data are now available from cadaver tests at three different severities of chest impact at 4.3 m/s, 6.7 m/s, and 9.3 m/s. Averages in peak force and deflection are given in Table 1 and biomechanical responses are shown in Figure 1 from (6) . Because the EUROSID dummy has an improved seating posture over earlier ATD* s and better biofidelity in other body regions, our project has focused on design improvements of the EURO- SID rib cage so that we can take advantage of the more human-like features of this device. This project involved the design, development and testing of three spring-steel ribs that attach to an aluminum block fitted to the spine of the EUROSID dummy. The ribs formed a con- tinuous loop when attached to the aluminum block and had a static stiffness comparable to the human lateral response. Damping material was glued to the inner surface of each rib to provide a rate-sensitive component to the impact response. The viscoelastic response was achieved in a manner similar to the current Hybrid III dummy with damping material attached to each rib. MATERIALS AND METHODS The current EUROSID thorax was disassembled by removing the impact-side ribs, axial spring and dashpot elements, spine attachments, and 1019</page><page sequence="2">TABLE 1 SUMMARY BIOMECHANICS AND INJURY FOR LATERAL THORACIC IMPACT (FROM (6)) Response Test Speed (m/s) 4.42 * 0.86 6.52 * 0.32 9.33 * 0.71 Force (kN) 2.67 * 0.99 3.10 * 0.46 6.30 * 0.90 Deflection (cm) 8.40 * 1.30 11.20 * 1.35 14.18 * 1.79 Compression (X) 26.1 * 4.1 34.9 * 4.5 43.2 * 3.9 VC (m/s) 0.62 * 0.23 1.10 * 0.18 2.05 * 0.41 Gt1 14.0 * 6.0 46.1 * 8.3 Gii"' 16.5 * 6.5 33.6 * 8.1 62.5 * 20.4 GjJģlĻ 12.6 * 8.5 25.4 * 5.1 54.6 * 25.3 MAIS 0.4 * 0.9 2.8 * 0.5 4.0 * 0.6 SAIS 0.4 * 0.9 2.8 * 0.5 3.8 * 0.4 Rib Fractures (#) 0.4 .* 0.9 5.2 *1.5 12.7 * 4.5 TABLE 2 CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HUMAN AND ATD CHESTS Chest Impact Responses Rib Mass Spine Mass Stiffness Damping (kg) (kg) (N/cm) (N/m/s) Front Human 0.45 27.20 263 (&lt;38 mm) 525 789 (&gt;38 mm) Hybrid III 1.00 27.50 650 530 Side Human 0.45 27.20 100 «40 mm) 400 320 (&gt;40 mm) Modified EUROSID 0.65 27.00 625 180 SID 9.08 14.55 3500 880 EUROSID 8.90 14.67 1000 540 1020</page><page sequence="3">]- 4 -ļ 8-1 '] ]- £2 4 -ļ A £21 ^ / •• /~-A sm &gt;■ ivo ^ - /'JJ, I- / ' / J^r î 1 í'/7Wr' S / ' X Wx5f 1" 2 /," /T liti ï" 2 //• //!

The total weight of the elements removed with the three ribs was 9.7 kg. The cross-sectional shape of the cur- rent EUROSID rib-cage was traced and estab- lished a target geometry (Figure 2) for three continuous rib-elements to provide structural stiffness replacing the axial spring-dashpot elements in the current EUROSID design. A continuous rib element was designed to achieve a static deflection response of 100-200 N/cm. The rib was constructed of spring- tempered steel with a thickness of 1.59 mm and width similar to the removed ribs. Each rib had a bent section shape identical to the cur- rent rib cage shape of the EUROSID. Each rib was designed to securely attach to an aluminum block which fits into the EUROSID spine. A 1.59 cm square cross section of United McGill damping material was epoxied to the inner sur- face of each rib. The cross sectional area of the damping material was selected to achieve a desired viscoelastic damping of approximately 50 N/m/s. The reassembled dummy with three ribs was laid sideways in a Material Testing Machine for static and dynamic loading of the rib cage through a six inch diameter flat interface according to an established procedure (5) . A static deflection of 5 cm loaded the rib cage from its undeformed position and the static stiffness of the rib-cage was recorded by a force transducer on the MTS actuator. Next, a 5 cm halversine displacement of duration 40 ms was applied to the thorax. This type of loading minimizes the contribution of inertia in the reaction force developed by chest deflection and provides an estimate of the viscoelastic contribution from rate-sensitive chest deformation. Finally, the impact head was offset from the thorax by 2 cm and the actuator set for 7 cm deflection with a longer duration Halversine loading function. This approach provided an abrupt impact of the side thorax, stimulating the inertia components as well as a similar maximum velocity of loading to stimulate the viscoelastic resistance. In a separate set of experiments, a power- assisted pendulum impact test was conducted according to a protocol previously described (6,7) . Impact force was determined by an accelerometer attached to the pendulum which loaded the lateral thorax of the modified EURO- SID at a velocity of 4.3 m/s or 6.7 m/s. The pendulum acceleration was filtered by a 180 Hz ARMA filter (or 100 Hz FIR for comparison with ISO corridors) and multiplied by the pendulum mass of 23.4 kg to compute impact force by an approach consistent with previous procedures. A Bourns linear position transducer with a 4 inch stroke and 4 k ohm resistance was fixed in a groove on the aluminum spinal block (Figure 3) . The free end of the LVTD was fixed to the center of the middle nearside rib. This trans- ducer provided a measure of deflection between the spine and nearside middle rib to determine deflection and Viscous response by a procedure previously recorded (8,9). This analysis approach is identical to the data processing protocol used in recent lateral impact experi- ments on human cadavers (6) and anesthetized animals (7) . High-speed photographs were also taken of lateral chest deflection and enabled independent analysis of the impact response of the modified EUROSID. RESULTS The single rib was supported in the mate- rial testing system and subjected to static and dynamic loading. Quasi-static deflections up to 50 mm demonstrated a linear elastic response with a stiffness of 75 N/cm. When the single rib was subjected to dynamic loading with a maximum rate of deflection of 2.5 m/s, the damping factor was identified as 52 N/m/s. The EUROSID was then reassembled with the modified three ribs including the aluminum spinal block and middle rib displacement transducer (Figure 3) . One centimeter of ensolite was used to cover each rib and the reassembled dummy was placed in the MTS for additional static and dynamic testing. The modified EUROSID dummy chest had a static stiffness of 625 N/cm and a dash-pot coefficient when subjected to a Haver- sine loading with maximum velocity of deforma- tion of 3.2 m/s at 180 N/m/s. The dynamic characteristics of the modified EUROSID chest compare favorably with the Hybrid III frontal impact response and produce large deflections at lower plateau levels as suggested by the human lateral impact response (Table 2) . The modified EUROSID chest was designed with a maximum internal deflection of 10 cm with an expected usable range of 80 mm internal deflec- tion when rubber stops are inserted to prevent metal contact at maximum deflection. The modified EUROSID dummy was seated upright and exposed to blunt lateral impact by power-assisted pendulum with a six inch diam- eter flat circular loading interface centered on the mid rib (this simultaneously loaded the three ribs) . Table 3 shows the peak responses for the 4.3 m/s impact tests. Also shown are the average and standard deviation for the human response (see Table 1 and Reference 6) and test data from the original EUROSID under identical conditions. The modified EUROSID chest provides much closer responses to the average human data. The improvement is even more striking when the responses from the modified EUROSID chest are superimposed on the ISO response corridors for blunt lateral pendulum loading (Figure 4) . Both the pendulum and spinal accelerations from the modified dummy fall within the established corridor responses. Figure 5 shows the data plotted in a different format, which is consis- tent with the published response data from our recent series of human cadaver tests. The force-deflection and deflection time response of the modified EUROSID again closely match the human response at 4.3 m/s impact lateral on the thorax (in this case the impact axis is 60* from frontal) . 1022</page><page sequence="5">Figure 2: a) Rib section from the EUROSID dummy with axial deforming spring and dashpot element, b) spring steel rim element from the modified EUROSID dummy with damping material attached. 1023</page><page sequence="6">Figure 3: a) Single rib element from the modified EUROSID chest with aluminum spinal block for moun- ting in the EUROSID spine (b) and photographs of the fully assembled rib cage of the modi- fied EUROSID with ensolite padding covering the rib element (c,d) . 1024</page><page sequence="7">TABLE 3 IMPACT RESPONSE DATA FROM TESTS OF THE MODIFIED EUROSID CHEST Velocity Force Deflection Viscous Spinal (m/s) (kN) Internal External External Accel.

The modified EUROSID chest seems to provide a close approxi- mation of the human response and, as such, has biofidelity. However, the modified EUROSID chest does not develop the same maximum levels of deflection as seen in the human response, even though they are nearly double the values obtained with the original EUROSID chest. The modified chest does provide much lower plateau force levels, consistent with the known compli- ance of the human chest. Figure 6 shows simi- lar force deflection and deflection time response data from our evaluations at 6.7 m/s. Again, very acceptable performance is demon- strated with the modified EUROSID chest. DISCUSSION This study demonstrates a design modifica- tion of the EUROSID dummy chest that provides biofidelity in the force-deflection and deflection-time response of the thorax under blunt lateral impact loading. The work shows promise in enabling the modified EUROSID to become an acceptable surrogate for dynamic testing of side-interior improvements to reduce injury risk in lateral impact. If these changes can be complemented by a continuous measurement of abdominal compression (10) , the torso of the EUROSID will provide a more com- plete determination of injury risk from arm rest and side-interior loading on the upper abdomen and thorax. This study has not involved a sensitivity, durability, or a complete engineering analysis of the modified EUROSID chest structure. Our experiences with the Hybrid III chest in frontal impacts give us confidence that the modified EUROSID chest will provide an acceptable ATD structure. This view is bol- stered by the similar construction of the Hybrid III ribs and attached damping material which has provided acceptable performance in a wide range of frontal impact exposures. Accep- tance of the modified EUROSID chest will be possible only after more exhaustive testing, yet this project provides an encouraging new design which significantly improves EUROSID biofidelity in side impacts.
