Sounik and Peter Gansen Miles, Inc. ABSTRACT Federal legislation mandates that automotive OEMs provide occupant protection in collisions involving front and side impacts. This legislation, which is to be phased-in over several years, covers not only passenger cars but also light-duty trucks and multipurpose passenger vehicles (MPVs) having a gross vehicle weigh rating (GVWR) of 8,500 lb (3,850 kg) or less. During a frontal impact, occupants within the vehicle undergo rapid changes in velocity. This is primarily due to rapid vehicle deceleration caused by the rigid nature of the vehicle's metal frame components and body assembly. Many of today's vehicles incorporate deformable, energy-absorbing (EA) structures within the vehicle structure to manage the collision energy and slow the deceleration which in turn can lower the occupant velocity relative to the vehicle. Occupant velocities can be higher in light-duty trucks and MPVs having a full-frame structure resulting in increased demands on the supplemental restraint system (SRS). In these types of vehicles an energy management system can be installed between the bumper and the vehicle structure to help absorb some of the collision energy and reduce occupant velocities. This paper describes an energy management system based on polyurethane foam to improve the crash signature of light-duty trucks and MPVs. The design and development requirements for this system are detailed as are material evaluations and full-scale impact testing. Development of a polyurethane material to meet the design requirements is also outlined. The test results demonstrate that vehicle crashworthiness can be improved by using energy-absorbing polyurethane foam to modify a vehicle's crash signature. INTRODUCTION With the enactment of federal legislation mandating occupant protection in automotive front and side impacts, OEMs have been searching for ways to provide efficient, lightweight and cost-effective energy management systems without sacrificing interior occupant space. Although much of the attention has been focused on improving the safety of passenger cars, occupant protection legislation also pertains to light-duty trucks and multipurpose passenger vehicles (MPVs). Current legislation requires all MPVs (GVWR of 8,500 lb (3,850 kg) or less) to comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 (FMVSS 208), Table 1. Within the next few years these requirements will become increasingly demanding with the volume-based phase-in of passive restraint requirements. For the 1998 model year, 100% fleet compliance with passive restraint standards is mandated for both light-duty trucks and MPVs. Table 1.

In order to improve occupant kinematics in front impacts, the sequence of events that occur during the collision must first be understood [1], Studying occupant kinematics in these situations, however, is no simple task since the entire crash sequence lasts only about 70 to 110 msec. Upon impact with a barrier, both the occupant and the vehicle undergo rapid changes in acceleration. The vehicle decelerates rapidly as contact is made and its structure begins to crush. A plot of vehicle deceleration (measured in g's) as a function of time is called the vehicle's crash signature. Vehicle 411</page><page sequence="2">velocity at any moment can be obtained from the crash signature by integration. High vehicle deceleration rates can place increased demands on the function of the occupant restraint system. The occupant, meanwhile, initially undergoes a rapid acceleration relative to the vehicle, then comes into contact with the vehicle's safety restraint systems, for example, the seats, seat belts, air bag, steering wheel, steering column and knee bolster. The occupant then decelerates as the vehicle's safety restraint systems are fully employed and the vehicle comes to a rest. The velocity of the occupant relative to the vehicle gives rise to an occupant energy, E (from E = 1/4mv2, where m is the mass of the occupant and v is the velocity of the occupant). High occupant energies during a collision can increase the risk of occupant injury. A large portion of the occupant energy arises from rapid vehicle deceleration which is primarily due to the rigidity of the vehicle's metal frame structure and body components. Many of today's passenger vehicles utilize energy-absorbing bumper systems and incorporate deformable structures within the vehicle structure to absorb energy and reduce the vehicle deceleration rate. Deceleration rates, which ultimately determine occupant energies, can be even higher in vehicles with full frames where it is difficult to design in these energy-absorbing structures. Many full-frame vehicles have zones within the vehicle front structure that do not contribute to energy absorption and therefore do not contribute to vehicle deceleration. A typical "dead" zone, or zone that offers no energy management potential, is in the front of the vehicle between the bumper and the vehicle structure. Utilization of an energy management system within these dead zones can significantly influence vehicle deceleration early in the event and improve the vehicle's crashworthiness by modifying the crash signature. To effectively use these dead zones to slow the vehicle, vehicle manufacturers evaluate materials and designs that have favorable energy absorbing characteristics. Ideal criteria for acceptance in these zones include: • Dissipation of multiaxial forces. Some materials and designs can effectively absorb energy only in one direction. • Efficient energy management. Energy absorbing materials should manage energy at a constant and predictable load. • System flexibility. Changes to the energy- absorption properties, design and tooling must be made quickly to accommodate the transition from early prototype to production phases. THE EFFECT OF ALTERING THE VEHICLE CRASH SIGNATURE As mentioned previously, rapid vehicle deceleration results in increased occupant velocity relative to the vehicle and therefore increased occupant energy. High occupant energies can place increased demand on the safety restraint systems by requiring that greater energies be managed. For example, steering columns must be designed to handle higher loads and more efficient materials must be employed within a defined space to manage the greater occupant energy. Occupant velocities can be reduced by modifying the vehicle's crash signature to lower deceleration levels early in the collision. A vehicle's crash signature can affect the air bag sensor and ultimately air bag deployment. Air bag sensors monitor vehicle deceleration rates during an impact to determine when to deploy the air bag(s). Significant differences in vehicle velocity must be detected in order to distinguish low-threshold (no fire) and high-threshold (all fire) events. Modifying the vehicle's crash signature can benefit the air bag crash sensors by providing earlier detection of low-threshold and high-threshold events. DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO VEHICLE ENERGY ABSORPTION Many approaches are available to manage energy in a crash and thereby alter the crash signature. Materials that exhibit consistent, repeatable performance and offer energy-absorbing properties that can be manipulated during vehicle development are desired. Steel. Steel can be fabricated to form a cylindrical shape, or "crush-can", which is designed to yield plastically under load. The energy-absorbing principle of crush-cans requires axial crush against a rigid member. A limitation of crush-cans is their potential for bending instead of crushing axially when nonaxial forces are encountered. During an actual collision, axial forces are rarely present throughout the entire event. Axial loading is difficult to maintain, and therefore the effectiveness and efficiency of the crush-can unit are reduced. During development the turnaround time of prototype crush-can parts may be time-consuming and may not adequately approximate the properties of the final system. Engineered Thermoplastics. In general, engineered thermoplastics have more design flexibility than steel. Lightweight parts utilizing multirib (honeycomb or egg- crate) designs can have their deformation characteristics tuned to a desired crush characteristic by simply changing the rib thickness, length or location. The ability to modify the design, however, may be restricted depending on the initial design of the tool. Radical 412</page><page sequence="3">design changes may even render the tool useless. The properties of engineered thermoplastics are not easily changed, and only a few polymers having a narrow range of properties are commercially available. Like steel crush-cans, multirib designs are sensitive to nonaxial loading. Multirib designs offer greater off-axis load-bearing capability than steel crush-cans, but the load-bearing capability is greatly diminished and they may exhibit plastic behavior. Polymer Foams. Unlike steel and engineered thermoplastics, polymer foams are cellular materials that perform adequately in all load directions (i.e., they are isotropic) and can have a wide range of crush characteristics. Polyurethane foams, in general, are the most versatile [2] since their formulations can be tailored and their foam densities changed to alter the energy- absorbing properties. Even high-density polyurethane foams can exhibit very good energy-managing characteristics, Figure 1 . 160 I ; 1 36 ' ' ; 30 120 ' 1 - CO - ; 24° z X ^ 1 I o&gt; 80 r 18 £ o / ^ o o / / ^ g "■ o / 12 g o 40 / '&gt; 6 0 [ ; , 1 1 0 0 15 30 45 60 Deflection (mm) Sample size: 125 mm x 125 mm x 100 mm Crosshead speed: 2.5 mm/min Figure 1. Load - deflection curve for a high-density, 17.5 pcf (280 kg/m3) polyurethane foam. MATERIAL SELECTION CRITERIA While many materials can be used effectively for energy absorption, most require long development time and are costly. During development, the ability to modify the vehicle crash signature quickly can be very desirable. Crash signatures are usually altered by changes to the vehicle structure which is time-consuming and often not constant or predictable. Therefore, modifying the crash signature using one of the materials described above is highly desirable. Choices for material selection were determined by the following criteria: • Performance. The ability to tailor and reduce vehicle deceleration as well as sense impact pulses earlier in the crash event for optimum air bag deployment. • Timing. The ability to prototype and test energy- absorbing designs In a timely manner. Ideally, minimal tooling expenditure would be required in the prototype stage. • Material Properties. The ability to quickly modify energy-absorbing properties and geometry as needed. • Reliability. The ability of the design to consistently perform in a multiple of real-world impact scenarios. Polymer foams and steel crush-cans are best for the early development phase, but design and manufacturing changes during development are likely to alter crush-can designs. Engineered thermoplastics require expensive tooling and take long to prototype. Polymer foams, however, are easy to prototype by cutting foam blocks to the desired shape. The mechanical properties of molded parts and parts cut from foam blocks show little difference. They can perform under conditions of non-axial loading with only minimal changes in system performance. Polyurethane foams in particular have a history of effective energy-absorption properties. These materials do not stack up or density during crushing and manage energy in available spaces more effectively. Therefore, an energy management system based on polyurethane foam was chosen to modify the crash signature. POLYURETHANE FOAM Polyurethane foams are currently used in vehicle interiors and exteriors for energy management. Typical interior uses include knee bolsters for occupant protection in frontal impacts [3] as well as hip and shoulder bolsters for side impact protection [4], In exteriors, polyurethane foam is used to minimize damage to bumper systems in low-speed (5 mph, 8 km/h) front and rear impacts. Densities of interior foams range from 2 to 5 pcf (30 to 80 kg/m3), while exterior foam densities range from 6 to 8 pcf (95 to 130 kg/m3). The energy involved in a full-frame vehicle impact at high speed is significantly greater than those encountered in interior occupant or bumper protection. For a 5,000 lb (2,250 kg) vehicle traveling at 30 mph (48 km/h), the energy that needs to be managed is approximately 150,000 ft-lb (200 kJ). Therefore, a nontradltional polyurethane foam had to be developed. High compressive strength, high stiffness and isotropic properties were required to efficiently absorb a large amount of energy and efficiently transfer the impact pulse to the air bag sensor. For optimum air bag deployment, the sensing of the impact pulse must be both instantaneous and independent of the angle of impact. 413</page><page sequence="4">MATERIAL DESCRIPTION The polymer foam developed for this application is a rigid, water-blown polyurethane foam having good energy-absorbing characteristics and isotropic mechanical properties. Some measured mechanical properties of the foam can be found in Table 2. Table 2.

Rigidity also helps increase the energy absorbing efficiency by introducing brittle segments into the foam structure which can crush and absorb energy. PROCESSING Processing of the foam is accomplished using the one- shot technique, whereby two liquid chemical components, components A and B, are accurately metered and then mixed together using high-pressure impingement mixing. Component A is a low-viscosity, oligomeric isocyanate having a functionality between 2.5 and 3. Component B is a fully formulated blend containing a mixture of polyether polyols, processing aids, catalysts and water. Water is used as the sole blowing agent. Water in the polyol blend reacts with the isocyanate to form carbon dioxide gas which generates a foam during polymerization. No chlorofluorocarbons or other chemicals potentially harmful to the environment are used as the blowing agent. Table 3 lists some of the recommended processing parameters. Table 3. Typical Processing Parameters [5], Processing Parameter Value Weight Ratio (isocyanate/polyol) 89.4/100 Chemical temperature, "F ('C) Isocyanate 80 (27) Polyol 85 (29) Mold temperature, "F ('C) 110 (43) In practice, the polyurethane chemicals are mixed using high-pressure, meter-mix equipment and open-poured into heated metal molds. The liquid chemicals are contained within the molds where they react, expand to fill the volume of the mold, and cure. Because the mixture stays liquid in the early stages of reaction, it can easily expand to fill the cavities of intricate mold designs and can readily encapsulate metal inserts. PROCESSING CONCERNS The molding of large, dense parts such as the ones described in this paper creates several processing problems which first had to be overcome. Internal Heat. Both the urethane and blowing reactions are exothermic. Furthermore, the quantity of heat generated is directly proportional to the mass of the polymer. Since polyurethane foam and organic polymers in general are not good thermal conductors, core temperatures can rise to the point where the polymer begins to exhibit plastic flow. Excessively high temperatures can lead to soft parts upon demolding. Figure 2 illustrates a typical temperature profile within the core of a high-density polyurethane foam. 200 I ¡ 1 : - - i ! 1 ; 350 O 150 7 i i 300 lT d) ! 250 ® L_ ¡ *- a b CO 100 200 2 0 I ® ! 150 E 0 0 »- 50 i 100 ! ! so 0 - - i - - I - - ¡ - . - I - . - I - - I - . - i - -J 0 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Time (min) Mold Temperature: 49° C Figure 2. Core temperature profile of a high-density polyurethane foam. Internal pressure. Carbon dioxide is generated when isocyanate reacts with water. When less than the required amount of water is present, insufficient foam is generated to fill the mold. If more than the required amount of water is present, excessive blowing can cause the internal pressure of the foam to rise considerably. High internal pressure can exceed the mechanical strength of the polymer when the polymer is no longer contained (i.e., the mold is opened) causing the part to expand. Figure 3 shows the relationship between water content and molding behavior. Chemical crosslinkina. A high degree of chemical crosslinking is necessary to maintain the rigidity of the foam and acquire the desired properties. Increased crosslinking also helps create thermal stability within the foam making it more resistant to plastic flow at elevated temperatures. However, a distinct quantity of heat is 414</page><page sequence="5">Figure 3. Effect of water content on molding behavior. released with each crosslink reaction. Thus a balance must be maintained between thermal stability and the heat released by chemical crosslinking. Figure 4 shows the relationships between thermal and polymer properties and chemical crosslinking. i ' / £ ' / / * ' O. ® Chemical Crosslinking ► Stiffness Heat Elongation Figure 4. Polyurethane foam structure - property relationships. CHEMICAL AND PROCESSING SOLUTIONS The choice of chemical components and molding conditions was critical in avoiding these processing problems. A balance was achieved between chemical crosslinking, internal heat and internal pressure. Crosslinking and Heat. The oligomeric isocyanate and polyols chosen for this system have good reactivity and a moderately high degree of chemical crosslinking. These choices strike a good balance between chemical crosslinking, which leads to thermal stability, and exothermic heat. As a result, optimum crosslinking was achieved which increased the thermal stability of the polymer while minimizing exothermic heat. Molding conditions were also important for balancing thermal effects. A mold temperature of 110° F (43° C) was sufficient for the urethane and blowing reactions to proceed while allowing exothermic heat to be absorbed during the final stages of reaction. A molded-in metal mounting bracket also served as a thermal bridge to withdraw excess heat from the core. Pressure. The optimum water concentration was determined to obtain sufficient blowing to fill the mold while minimizing excessive blowing that creates high internal pressure. Additionally, a catalyst package was developed which accelerated the blowing reaction allowing the water to be consumed before foam cure had begun. In doing so, gas generation in the final stages of reaction that can lead to excessive internal pressures was avoided. TEST PROCEDURE Modification of a vehicle's crash signature using Polyurethane foam was measured by impacting modified commercial full-frame vehicles into a fixed concrete barrier, Figure 5. Measurements were performed on two vehicles, one with and one without polyurethane foam. The curb weight of the vehicles ranged from 5,000 to 7,000 lb (2,250 to 3,175 kg). Ballast was added per FMVSS 208 requirements. Figure 5. Barrier crash test conditions. The energy management system was composed of three polyurethane foam blocks molded at a density of 17.5 pcf (280 kg/m3). One large block (5 in x 7 in x 10 in, 125 mm X 180 mm x 250 mm) was attached to the front bumper in line with the engine. Two smaller blocks (2.5 in x 4 in x 10 in, 65 mm x 100 mm x 250 mm) were attached at each end of the front bumper just inboard of the flare. Placement of the foam blocks was such that they reacted against rigid structures upon impact, Figure 6. Test parameters were set according to FMVSS 208. During the test sequence the vehicle was guided via tow cable so that it traveled in a straight line and impacted 415</page><page sequence="6">Figure 6. Energy management system using high- density polyurethane foam. the barrier perpendicular to its direction of movement. Vehicle velocity prior to impacting the barrier was approximately 30 mph (48 km/h). Vehicle deceleration was recorded using two accelerometers. One accelerometer was attached to the left sill (rocker) area just in front of the left rear wheel and the other to the right rear sill (rocker) area just in front of the right rear wheel. Both accelerometers were placed equidistant from the initial impact plane. The vehicle velocity calculations and displacement values were generated from integration of the acceleration data. Displacement values were confirmed by analysis of high- speed film. A Hybrid III anthropomorphic test dummy was used to obtain the chest velocity values which were calculated from data collected from accelerometers located in the upper chest area. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Front impacts were measured at about 30 mph (48 km/h) on commercial full-frame vehicles both with and without energy-absorbing polyurethane foam. Table 4 gives a summary of the results. In a typical vehicle crash test, very little deceleration was initially detected (&lt;5 msec) when the vehicle impacted the barrier. Easily deformable structures at the front of the vehicle buckled and crushed but did not efficiently absorb energy that would slow the vehicle's deceleration. As crushing continued, rigid members within the vehicle's structure impacted the barrier (@15 msec), and the vehicle's deceleration increased substantially. After reaching a maximum or peak, the vehicle's deceleration decreased rapidly (20 to 25 msec) as a large portion of the impact energy was absorbed by buckling of the vehicle's metal frame and body components. Rear sill deceleration continued to slowly decrease erratically until the vehicle came to a full stop (90 to 100 msec). The erratic nature of the vehicle's deceleration after @30 Table 4.

The large deceleration changes that occurred in the 0 to 40 msec range resulted in the greatest occupant velocities relative to the vehicle. Analysis by high-speed film showed compression of the polyurethane foam during the initial moments of the impact. In doing so the foam helped absorb impact energy. Calculations from compressive strength testing of the center and side foam blocks, Figure 7, showed that 38,000 ft-lb (51 .7 kJ) of energy can be absorbed by the center section and 14,300 ft-lb (19.4 kJ) of energy can be absorbed by each of the side sections after about 70% compression under quasi-static conditions. This corresponds to an energy-absorbing efficiency of about 40%. 400 i ; 1 1 90 ! / CO 300 / / CO Ó y X 60 *- Ä * *aT 200 £ ü - o © il 30 Li 100 'j ; £ 0 !

Left rear sill deceleration. 43 g's when the polyurethane foam was used, a reduction of about 20%, Figure 8. By reducing a vehicle's deceleration rate, the occupant's velocity relative to the vehicle will also be reduced. Noteworthy was the smoothening of the crash signature resulting from the use of polyurethane foam. The initial variation in deceleration using the foam (line CD corresponding to 33 g's) was much less than without the foam (line AB corresponding to 47 g's). This smoothening may increase the ability to predict vehicle deceleration rates and reduce occupant impact effects within the vehicle caused by erratic vehicle deceleration. Furthermore, supplemental restraint system function is more reliable when the vehicle deceleration rate is more stable. 60 I ; ; ¡ ¡ 1 50 - A ; ; - - - ļ 3 40 - /• I 1 1 I o 30 ¡ V I / - ' 2 '/ M' / ' x A v' X í jū 2 20 '/ '/ M' 1 / 'r' A ?í ' / ' / i ' a. d) 10 ' ' j - V i ~ ' a.

The vehicle crash signature measured at the right rear sill is shown in Figure 9. An even greater reduction in peak deceleration was observed when the polyurethane foam was used. Peak deceleration was lowered from 55 g's to 37 g's resulting in a 33% decrease. This may be due to energy absorption by the foam, more effective crushing of steel members, or both. 60 I ; 1 ¡ ; 1 50 A ' ' /I 1 I I CO / ' I 3 40 / » i O 30 !

Average rear sill deceleration. Averaging both the left and right sill crash signatures gave a peak deceleration decrease of 26% when polyurethane foam was used, Figure 10. Polyurethane foam also resulted in earlier detection of the vehicle's deceleration. The crash signatures illustrated in figures 8, 9 and 10 all show distinct differences in the initial (0 to 10 msec) deceleration rate. Deceleration occurred much earlier in the vehicle containing the polyurethane foam, which may allow for earlier sensing of an impact resulting in earlier deployment of the air bag restraint system. Note too that the peak deceleration also occurs earlier in the impact event when foam was used. This suggests more effective energy absorption is taking place at the front of the vehicle. 60 I ; : ; ¡ 1 50 - ■ S' 40 '' E : if. 30 t 20 o - v &gt; 10 0 !

Figure 12 shows a similar trend in vehicle velocity at the right rear sill. Placement of the foam up front results in earlier absorption of impact energy and, therefore, an earlier reduction in vehicle velocity. When no foam is used, a period of about 8 to 10 msec passes with no decrease in velocity which indicates that a "dead" zone exists where no energy absorption occurs. 60 1 : ; ; : 50 - _ - - 1" ; - - ļ £ 40 &gt; ' ' Ē !

Average rear sill velocity Also note that the average vehicle velocity, Figure 13, shows a generally smoother decrease in velocity. Energy absorption by the polyurethane foam at the point of impact could result in less energy being transmitted to the vehicle resulting in more even crushing of the vehicle structure. Improving the crash signature with polyurethane foam also reduced the time needed for the vehicle to come to a full stop. The vehicle with foam came to a stop approximately 5 msec sooner than the vehicle without foam which suggests that the total time available for energy absorption was used more efficiently. 8 ! i i i s-ta) ' : : r ^'_ 1 i 1 ' / Ł r fx ' ' V - - ' : / ü I - I I O I ' v _ " / ~ I 0 i ' _ " " ^ / x-r - &gt; (24) - ; : ¡ (32) ' ' ' 1 ■ • • 1 ■ ' ■ 1 ' 1 1 ■ 1 • 0 20 40 60 80 100 Time (msec) Without foam With foam Figure 14.

The vehicle displacement calculated at the left rear sill is shown in Figure 15. Peak displacement for the vehicle containing polyurethane foam was 2.2 in (56 mm) less than for the vehicle without foam. Lowering the vehicle displacement can result in less intrusion into the occupant compartment in vehicles having forward mounted occupant compartments or less displacement of forward rigid structures (e.g., engine, steering box) into the occupant space. 418</page><page sequence="9">200 iiii iiii iiii •p o &lt;r 1 1 1 E, o &lt;r ! i i c (200) ¡ ¡ ļ i : ; ; J(4°°) : ; j ; ....

The results presented here have demonstrated that it is possible to design an energy management system based on polyurethane foam that is capable of managing the energy and improving the crash signature of full-frame vehicles in frontal collisions. The placement of polyurethane foam at the front of the vehicle has effectively utilized space within a dead zone to manage large quantities of energy where otherwise no energy management would have occurred. The success of this system has been achieved through the close cooperation of OEM engineers and chemists from the material supplier. SUMMARY Polyurethane foam can be used to modify a vehicle's crash signature when extensive structural changes are not desired. These foams are best used to enhance an existing vehicle structure. The energy management system containing polyurethane foam described herein can improve vehicle crashworthiness by: • Lowering peak vehicle deceleration rates • Smoothening the vehicle's crash signature • Quicker reduction in vehicle velocity • More effective use of the available crush zone • Lowering vehicle displacement These improvements can be related to occupant safety through reduced occupant velocity relative to the vehicle and earlier impact detection for air bag deployment. In addition, polyurethane foam can be used to modify a vehicle's energy management characteristics in a timely manner while maintaining consistent mechanical properties from prototype stages through production. Its performance stability throughout the development and validation cycles is desired to accurately predict performance outcomes.
