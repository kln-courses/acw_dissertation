The main problem in Pindar's fr. 169a1 is thè relationship of thè fa- mous introductory gnome (1-4) to the following account of two of Héraclès' labors, the theft of Geryon's cattle and Diomedes' mares. Héraclès is presented as violent and stealthy: he takes away the cattle of Geryon «without paying and without asking for it», as Piato says (Grg. 484bll), and steals the mares of Diomedes by night and after throwing in their manger an unfortunate groom to be dismembered and devoured by the monsters (fr. 169a 19-32); Diomedes bravely resists the loss of his property as befits a noble man and a son of Ares. Usually Pindar présents Héraclès as an instrument of the will of Zeus and as the benefactor of mankind who éliminâtes monstrous opponents2. Scholars thought that the violence of Héraclès in fr. 169a had to be explained in some way and that thè gnome at the be- 1. The text is cited from the Teubner édition of Pindar's fragments by H. Ma- ehler (1989). Fragment 169a is a composite put together from a quotation in Piato (Grg. 484b) and a paraphrase in Aelius Aristides or. 45.52 (2.68-69 Dindorf) with the scholia ad loc. (3.408 Dindorf) and a papyrus find (POxy. 2450). For quotations in other authors see thè testimonia in Maehler. The poem was proba- bly a dithyramb according to the editor of the papyrus, E. Lobel, The Oxyrhyn- chus Papyn, XXVI, London 1961, 141. 2. On Héraclès in Pindar see M. Gigante, ΝΟΜΟΣ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΥΣ, Naples 1956, 56-71.</page><page sequence="2">196 Poulberia Kyriakou ginning of thè poem held thè key to thè problem. The interprétation of the gnome, however, has proven far from straightforward since it turns on the meaning of the common but semantically multivalent first word of the poem, νόμος3, as well as on the meaning of the par- ticiple δίκαιων. The latter is usually interpreted as «making just, jus- tifying» and both of the standard interprétations of νόμος, «custom» and «law of thè universe or law of Zeus», assume this justification of violence. In this paper I will argue that thè idea of justice or the jus- tification of violence has no support in the text. Those who argue that νόμος is the expression of divine justice and the order of the 3. As H. Lloyd-Jones, Pindar Fr. 169, in id., Greek Epie, Lyric and Tragedy, Oxford 1990, 163-164 (= «HSCP» 76 [1972], 54-55) has noted, the term has been understood mainly as «custom, usage» or some variation of «law of thè universe, law of Zeus, fate or necessity»; cf. C. Pavese, «The New Héraclès Poem of Pin- dar» «HSCP» 72 (1968) 48. According to the first interprétation, gods and hu- mans do not castigate but consider justifiable Héraclès* violent behavior because of the customary favor and révérence toward him. The gods, though, did not cu- stomarily favor Héraclès: Hera, whose bidding is mentioned in this fragment too (44), was his archenemy and Ares was Diomedes' father; Poseidon was the gran- dfather of Geryon and Héraclès fought against him as well as Apollo and Hades at Pylos (O. 9.29-35). Zeus* goodwill toward Héraclès was definitely not custo- mary but a manifestation of paternal affection which ensured the hero's survival. Even if the gods can be said to have customs, the favor toward Héraclès cannot count among them and thus cannot exemplify the supposed rule of custom over the gods. Those who understand νόμος as the fated order of thè universe or the law of Zeus suggest that violence is ultimately part of the plan of fate or Zeus for the just administration of the world. Lloyd-Jones (154-165) suggested that νόμος is identical with the will of Zeus. Gigante (above, η. 2) devoted a whole book to νόμος and interpreted it as «il principio assoluto della divinità. L'assoluto divino, in Pindaro, ha come suo attributo la forza [...] la giustizia è anche essa attributo deirAssoluto e da il sigillo della giustificazione all'opera violenta» (92). This is a problematic argument because it implies that the divine may be a violent perpe- trator who somehow uses justice to justify injustice; if ali divine actions are just, there is no need for justification, even if some of thèse actions are violent. M. Treu, ΝΟΜΟΣ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΥΣ' alte und neue Probleme «Rhein. Mus.» 106, 1963, 211- 214 and Pavese, 47-88 made more interesting suggestions which will be discussed below. For M. Ostwald, Pindar, Nomos, and Héraclès «HSCP» 69, 1965, 109- 138, esp. 117 ff. see below n. 5. More recently K. Crotty, Song and Action, Balti- more 1982, 104-108, tried to reconcile the idea of human belief s with a divine law in which they are grounded; see below n. 16. D. Grote, Callicles* Use of Pindar* s Νόμος ßaoiXevc Gorgias 484b, «Class. Journ.» 90, 1994 21-31, cites approvingly both Ostwald and Lloyd-Jones. M. Demos, Lyric Quotation in Piato (Lanham 1999) 54-56, expands on Crotty 's view; she suggests that Pindar's νόμος harks back to the original dérivation of thè word from the verb νέμω and thus means «apportionment», «allotment» or «the existing state of affairs». But this etymo- logy strengthens the association with μοίρα. At any rate, for the Greeks the 'exi- sting state of affairs' is usually determined by thè gods or fate or both in coopé- ration. Surprisingly, Demos does not consider any of thèse connections.</page><page sequence="3">The violence of nomos in Pindar fr. 169a 197 universe do not do so convincingly. They hâve to account for the fact that among the numerous feats of Héraclès Pindar chose specifi- cally two which involved treacherous aggression, i.e. plain injustice, against opponents who neither attacked Héraclès himself nor are portrayed as a hazard to mankind in generai. This undeniable fact, not qualified or mitigated by anything in the extant poem, can only lead to the conclusion that Pindar meant to underscore a deep prob- lem in the nature of divine justice or of the gods themselves. This tragic or Euripidean view of divinity would be intriguing and wor- thy of Pindar but it raises serious questions that rule out the possi- bility of including it in the known religious beliefs of Pindar. That the gods not only use violence themselves but also order mortals to use violence is a given in Greek myth. In one of the most extreme cases Orestes killed his own mother to avenge the murder of his fa- ther. Though committed at divine behest, such crimes posed a seri- ous moral dilemma: they were not considered justified by the Greeks but they were in a way unavoidable because of the harsh law of retaliation. Why would a just Zeus order or tolerate the defeat of Geryon and Diomedes? Lloyd-Jones (above, n. 3, 164) has sug- gested that Geryon and Diomedes were outlaws and monsters who lived outside the themistes and that killing them would be a justified and even glorious deed. But it is very implausible that Pindar would not be more explicit about such an important factor in thè story and would instead choose to suggest the monstrosity of Héraclès' oppo- nents by stressing their legitimate rights and even their nobility4. This skewed view has affected not only the interprétation of the Pindaric fragment but also the discussion of its function in Plato's Gorgias. Before I focus on δίκαιων a word about the meaning of νόμος is in 4. The mares of Diomedes had to hâve a fairly steady supply of human flesh and Diomedes is reported to hâve used his guests as fodder (Diod. 4.15.3) but Pindar does not provide any information about Diomedes apart from his genea- logy and the courageous défense of his property. Even if the audience's kno- wledge of the traditions about Diomedes is factored in, Héraclès, on whose behavior Pindar dwells, can by no means be thought to hâve the moral high ground: he behaved exactly like the Diomedes of the tradition and fed a man to the monsters. Geryon is not even known to hâve harmed anybody and this labor of Héraclès' was essentially a heroic cattle-raid. Fragment 81 (σέ δ' έγώ παρά μιν αίνέω μεν, Γηρυόνα, το δέ μη Δί φίλτερον σιγψμι πάμπαν), which Lloyd-Jones addu- ces as an exact parallel to fr. 169a (cf. Demos [above, n. 3], 52-53), may indicate that the will of Zeus involved the vanquishing of Geryon but it does not demon- strate the monstrosity of the victim or the just nature of his defeat (on this frag- ment see also below). The violence of Héraclès in fr. 169a can be considered ju- stified only by special pleading. Zeus or justice are not even mentioned in the poem and consequently νόμος has to be disengaged from them.</page><page sequence="4">198 Poulheria Kyriakou order. The word is semantically quite flexible but it is also very common and poses a thorny interpretive problem candidly stated by Pavese (above, n. 3, 48) long ago: νόμος, without further spécifi- cations, in the sensé of 'fate' or similar is not attested in early Greek but the well-attested meaning 'custom' is irrelevant to the context of Pindar's poem5. It is possible that Pindar postulated a very generai concept of a sovereign power governing everything, including the gods. He stressed the function of this universal power as a supreme 5. The only certain thing about νόμος in the fragment is what Pindar himself says about it, namely that it is an all-pervasive power governing with extreme violence the affairs of both gods and men. Unfortunately, the various quotations of the fragment in later authors have not provided help with the elucidation of the meaning of νόμος. I will discuss Callicles* use of the Pindaric quotation in Plato's Gorgias (484b) below. For now let it suffice to say that Callicles présents his version of the well-known sophistic antithesis between νόμος and φύσις. The idea that Pindar suggested anything similar to Callicles* νόμος in the gnome has found few adhérents; see A. Boeckh, Pindari Opera Quae Supersunt, Leipzig 1821, 640 and cf. G. Pini, Sul νόμος ò πάντων βασιλεύς di Pindaro (Fr. 169 Sn4), «SIFC» 46, 1974, 185-210. Recently, B.K. Braswell, A Commentary on Pindar Nemean M«e, Berlin-New York 1998, 73, has sided with this view. He sees both N. 9.15 (κρέσσων δέ καππαύει δίκαν ταν πρόσ&amp;εν άνήρ) and fr. 169a «as an expres- sion of a simple realism rather than a moral justification of might». I agrée that thè winning party in a contest is stronger than thè losing party and that moral ju- stification of victory is not involved in either poem but I do not find convincing the view that thè mere acknowledgment of the efficacy of brute force was Pinda- r's objective. In fr. 169a violence is backed by νόμος and it would be otiosely tau- tological for Pindar to claim that violence is backed by brute force. Héraclès did not attack Geryon and Diomedes spontaneously or for his own benefit and Pin- dar stresses not only the brute force but also the treachery of Héraclès. Aristi- des, on the other hand, seeks to answer Plato's attack on rhetoric in the Gorgias. Aristides' law is the written law and thus has nothing to do with Callicles' νόμος or, much less, with Pindar's. Similarly, Herodotus (3.38) quotes thè first line of the fragment in a context that has no relation to the Pindaric gnome. Herodotus narrâtes an experiment by the Persian king Dareius who asked Greeks and In- dian Callatiae, whose custom was to eat their dead, at what price they would be willing to exchange their funeral customs. Both peoples denied such possibility with horror and Herodotus concludes that Pindar was right to proclaim custom (νόμος) the king of ail. The Herodotean νόμος cannot account for the absolute power of νόμος in the gnome nor can it plausibly be said to guide (άγει, 3) the af- fairs of gods and men. It is indeed very unlikely that custom would have anything to do with the gods. Ostwald (above, n. 3) made one of the most syste- matic efforts to address the interpretive problems of the fragment in the light of the Herodotean passage: he argued that νόμος is «the attitude traditionally or conventionally taken to a norm by those to whom it applies» (124) and that «the traditional attitude of men toward the hero who rid the world of monsters and of the gods toward the son of Zeus [...] makes just the violence of thè acts which he committed» (126). His suggestion seems to be another version of the «custom» interprétation: see Lloyd-Jones (above, n. 3) 163.</page><page sequence="5">The violence of nomos in Pindar fr. 169a 199 regulator and an amoral, violent agent. It is called «the king of ail» and the force of its hand is stressed. It is pure, violent action that cannot be thwarted or resisted. He could hâve called this power «fate» or «necessity» and it is true that it incorporâtes the main at- tribute of the Homeric fate, the déférence even the supreme god shows to it6. Pindar chose not to identify νόμος with fate, despite the common ground they share. Fate or the Fates could evoke a host of associations that he may have wished to eschew in order to focus exclusively on the power and inescapability of νόμος; Ι will return to the possible reasons of Pindar's choice of the word νόμος at the end of the paper, after the discussion of δίκαιων. The interprétation of δικαιώ présents a problem similar to that presented by νόμος but for- tunately the solution is simpler. The meaning 'to make just, justify' is not attested until the Septuaginta and even there, as Pavese has pointed out (above, n. 3, 58, n. 25), it means «'to absolve' (= lat. jus- tificari), which is not precisely 'to justify'». What is more important, it is unnecessary to attribute this meaning to the verb because, quite unlike the attested meanings of νόμος, thè attested meaning of the verb makes good sense in the context of the fragment. Scholars in favor of the unattested meaning argue that the verb, a denominative in -όω, is a factitive and thus its 'regulär* meaning is 'to justify'. The verb could indeed have this meaning but in extant Greek it does not. Smyth, for instance, notes that denominatives in -όω are usually (my emphasis) factitive, a spécification consistently ignored or glossed over in discussions of the meaning of the verb7. 6. There is a tension between the hierarchical, anthropomorphic conception of the divine world with Zeus as the supreme ruler governing the universe and that of the largely impersonal, supreme power of fate that does not answer to, and has sway over, him. In Homer Zeus, not to mention the other gods, does not embrace wholeheartedly everything that fate ordains but he does not interfère with its ordinances, especially as far as décisions on death and destruction are concerned. On two very well-known occasions in thè Iliad Zeus entertains the idea of saving Sarpedon and Hector from death (16.433-438 and 22.168-176) but he refrains because he is loath to disturb the order of thè universe and set a bad précèdent for the other gods. The fact that he entertains the possibility of alte- ring the course of fate is one of Homer's ways of stressing the extent of the god's affection and grief; see H. Erbse, Untersuchungen zur Funktion der Götter im homenschen Eposy Berlin 1986, 287-288 and cf. R. Janko, The Iliad: A Commen- tary IV, Cambridge 1992, 5-6 who comments on the interplay between the will of fate, gods and humans. This tension largely dissipâtes when thè bidding of fate is identical with the will of Zeus. In anthropomorphic terms Pindar makes Tyche, the most important among the Moirai, Zeus* daughter (O. 12.1-2; cf. L. Lehnus, Pindaro, Olimpiche, Milano 1981, 188). 7. H.W. Smyth, Greek Grammar, Cambridge MA 1920, rev. ed. 1956, rpr. 1984, 245.</page><page sequence="6">200 Poulheria Kyriakou LSJ interprets Οικαιώ in fr. 169a as «to set right»8, a unique gloss which has rightly been called ambiguous9. For the rest it lists two basic meanings: a) «hold or deem right, claim or demand as a right», under which also fall «consent», «allow» and b) «do a man right or justice» under which fall «chastise or punish», «pass sentence on» and in the passive «hâve right done one, opp. άδικεΐσθαι». As Fraenkel has shown, Aeschylus' Ag. 393 (δικαιωθείς), which LSJ er- roneously interprets as «tested, proved», should also be included in the second group in the sensé «brought to justice»10. Based on this passage and a few others, Pavese (above, n. 3, 58) has suggested that δικαιω has the same meaning in Pindar: Héraclès, acting as the in- strument of νόμος, brings to justice the violent deeds of Diomedes. According to Pavese the subject of line 15 is Héraclès, a prima facie attractive suggestion which could save the image of a valiant Héra- clès ridding the world of monsters and hubrists. The testimony of the papyrus commentator on line 15, though, leaves no room for it: Héraclès steals the mares and Diomedes is commended for resisting the theft of his property. Héraclès* act is explicitly said to be an act of injustice11. The only attested meaning of δικαιω left is the first and I submit that the participle δίκαιων is used in this sensé in the fragment12. Νόμος, the sovereign power, claims extreme violence as its preroga- tive, reserves it as its right in order to fulfill its ends. The labors of Héraclès exemplify this truth on a grand scale because of the magni- tude of the hero's achievements and especially of the violence in- volved. The labors hâve to be performed and in the process Diomedes and Geryon hâve to be brought low. The most efficient means to accomplish the tasks are violence and ruthless treachery. Νόμος empowers or perhaps forces Héraclès to act violently, i.e. un- justly. It does not make violence just, it only makes use of violence. Héraclès' injustice is not justified but shown to be the means that a sovereign, amoral power uses to bring about the Implementation of its will.

Héraclès' acts are not shown to be ignoble because Héraclès was acting under the sovereign power of νόμος which destined Diomedes to defeat. If Pindar had meant to stress thè power of the justice of νόμος he would hâve undermined his case by stressing the legitimate rights of Héraclès* opponents13. What Pindar is more likely to hâve been willing to stress is the sweeping power of νόμος which does not take into account anything but its own plans and enforces their materialization through treach- ery and extreme violence. Even the gods cannot interfère with this right, which is the trademark of its absolute power. Since the sovereign power of νόμος knows no limits it becomes ail the more surprising that Treu, whose article is one of the most sensi- ble on the subject, followed a hint by Schroeder14 and concluded that νόμος has a limited power. Treu (above, η. 3, 211-212) correctly agrées with Fraenkel on the interprétation of Aeschylus' Agamem- non 393 and points out (the only scholar to do so as far as I know) that the meaning of δικαιώ is «to claim or demand as a right»15; νόμος is divine and expressed through divine precepts but it backs only one side, Héraclès', of what Treu sees as a (largely unresolved) tragic conflict in the poem: on the other side, Diomedes', there are also rights and divine sanction; there is not one sovereign νόμος but two (and presumably, I would add, as many as there might be clashes in the world) opposing each other on an equal footing. This duplica- 13. Pindar probably found an authoritative précèdent for his présentation of Héraclès and his opponents in fr. 169a and 81 in Stesichorus' Geryonis: one frag- ment (S 15) describes how Héraclès stealthily managed to shoot one of Geryon's heads. Stesichorus apparently presented Geryon in a favorable light, as a beloved son (S 13), a noble fighter determined to die honorably rather than suffer the di- sgrâce of defeat (and the loss of his property?) (SII), and a sympathetic victim (SI 5). See the discussion of Ch. Segai, Stesichorus in P.E. Easterling-B.M. W Knox (eds.), The Cambridge History of Classical Literature, I, Cambridge 1985, 190- 195 and cf. G. Arrighetti, Stesicoro e il suo pubblico, «MD» 32, 1994, 14-15. Re- markably, Segai advances a hypothesis that has similarities to the interprétation of νόμος as divine justice in fr. 169a. In SI 5 the lethal arrow of Héraclès is said to pierce Geryon's skull «in accordance with divine fate» (δαίμονος αίσαι). On the basis of this spécification and a Council of the gods mentioned in SI 4 Segai (195) suggests that divine justice was involved in the death of Geryon and that the dé- cision about his fate was probably taken on «some principle of order and ju- stice», as is the case with the deaths of Patroclus and Hector in the Iliad. Howe- ver, the only factor mentioned explicitly in fragments Si 3 and Si 5 is fate (μόρσι- μον and αίσαι) and the deaths of ali Homeric heroes are predetermined by fate; see above, n. 6. 14. O. Schroeder, ΝΟΜΟΣ Ο ΠΑΝΤΩΝ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΥΣ, «Philologus» 74, 1917, 196. 15. He suggests, though, that the Anstotehan meaning ot the verb (e.g. LN 1136a) is «to justify», which is inaccurate.</page><page sequence="8">202 Poulheria Kyriakou tion or multiplication of νόμοι has no support in the fragment. Pin- dar may well have intended to portray thè story of Héraclès* two labors in a tragic light, or to deal with the problematic nature of vio- lence prescribed by a superior force, but thè tragedy lies in the com- plete vanquishing of one party by the other. Diomedes does have rights but there is only one νόμος which has ali the power and em- powers Héraclès to triumph, by any means necessary, over Diomedes. Treu also mentions the values of mortals and suggests that the rights of both Héraclès and Diomedes are legitimized through them, a view that foreshadows Crotty16. These values, though, should in- clude only the 'traditionaP kind of justice, which praises and/or re- wards the good, blâmes and/or punishes the bad and is, on occasion at least, overruled by superior powers such as νόμος or the will of the gods. These associations are briefly but quite clearly illustrated in thè dithyramb fragment (81), quoted above (n. 4), where Pindar endorses Geryon's behavior but refuses to dwell on things hateful to Zeus. This fragment has been considered particularly relevant to the interprétation of fr. 169a. It should be used with more circum- spection because of the lack of any context. Even if the whole dithyramb were extant, though, and the interprétation of fragment 81 remained the same, the fragment by no means involves a justifica- tion of Héraclès through the love of Zeus for him or, much less, an indication that men praise the hero because Zeus loves him. The statement of Pindar, who of course praises Geryon, is indicative of the attitude of ali mortals to events that violate their sensé of justice: they keep a resigned and prudent silence in the face of superior 16. Crotty, (above, η. 3), has suggested that human notions of justice, in the case of fragment 169a the notion that Diomedes is just and Héraclès unjust, are modified according to divine desires to exalt or humble heroes, i.e. according to divine νόμος; men are thus forced to praise the otherwise conventionally blame- worthy and vice versa. This attempt to reconcile a supposed divine and a human νόμος falls through because, if human notions of conventional justice are presu- mably based on divine precepts, desires etc., by Crotty's lights there are many divine νόμοι, which operate on a capricious basis with multiple and ultimately in- scrutable restrictions and exceptions. For example, in a fight between a son of Zeus and a son of Ares mortals should confidently side with the former. What, though, if a son of Poseidon and Apollo or Apollo and Ares fought? Would the seniority of the father be the crucial factor or perhaps thè favor of Zeus? If the latter, then we are not very far from admitting the existence of a single, ultimate νόμος, the will of Zeus, which is often identical with fate (cf. above, n. 6). The most serious objection to Crotty's view is that Pindar's poem does not contain any hint that two, let alone more, νόμοι might operate virtually at the same time or at ail. It appears that Aelius Aristides may hâve been right to claim that Pindar mentioned the labors of Héraclès ούκ είσηγούμενος ουδέ συμβουλεύων ... άλλ' ώσπε- ρεί σχετλιάζων (2, 70 Dindorf).</page><page sequence="9">The violence of nomos in Pindar fr. 169a 203 powers. Fragment 81 is probably one of Pindar's break-off passages where the poet gives a hint but refuses to elaborate because he wishes to protect himself from the danger of impiety17. In both frag- ment 81 and 169a everybody is subject to the mandates of a univer- sal, inescapable power. Diomedes and Geryon were bound to be valiant and vanquished, Héraclès violent and victorious18. His vie- tory over Geryon and Diomedes shows much more clearly the jolt of thè power of νόμος than a reassuring traditional scenario accord- ing to which the 'good' are rewarded and the 'bad' punished: this power can make even noble heroes like Héraclès behave violently and treacherously against 'good', praiseworthy opponents like Diomedes and Geryon. The supreme hand enforces its will without exceptions and has no need for justification. If the violence necessary for the accomplishment of Héraclès' labors is indeed the main thème in Pindar's poem, then Callicles' quotation of it in Plato's Gorgias makes better rhetorical sensé than it has usually been credited with, although Callicles is mainly inter- ested in the νόμος of nature. According to Callicles, the strong shat- ter the shackles of conventional laws imposed by the weaker mem- bers of thè society and take what they need, asserting themselves. The variant reading βιαίων (= βίαιων) το δικαιότατον (3), attested in all the major Piatonic MSS, has been the subject of much discussion and controversy, despite the consensus that it does not represent the genuine Pindaric text. The variant may well be due to a fairly com- mon type of scribal error, spöonerism19; it has also been suggested that it was an accidentai or even intentional misquotation on the part of Piato put in the mouth of Callicles in order to make him ap- pear as an incompétent speaker who uses an invalid argument to bolster a questionable thesis20. Those who understand δικαιω as «to make just» and consider the variant a spöonerism assume that the 17. See, e.g. O. 9.35-41, 13.91, N. 5.14-18 with the comments of T.K.

On the other hand, the supporters of the intentional misquotation suggest that Callicles would be inclined or more likely to stress the violence which would resuit in the Implementation of justice. As argued above, thè idea of justice is not to be found in Pindar and there is no indication that Piato read it there. Callicles projects his own idea of justice on Pindar's νόμος. This is an easy association in a society with written laws, in a culture where thè idea of law is closely associated with justice and indeed in an argument where written laws and justice, or lack thereof, play a major rôle. Callicles does not seem to need support for his idea of justice because this is embedded, and sufficiently argued for, in the concept of naturai law, which is not a revolutionary idea in fourth Century Greek ethics, even if the particular twist Callicles gives it may be radical. If Calli- cles does not need to suggest thè idea of justice with the quotation, then there would be little point in an intentional misquotation. What Callicles needs to buttress, and what in my opinion he turns to the authority of Pindar for, is thè idea that violence is necessary for the Implementation of the rule of the stronger. Since, as argued above, Pindar stresses the violence freely used by νόμος, the référ- ence to the Pindaric poem was quite successful from a rhetorical point of view because Pindar's Héraclès is a worthy rôle model for Callicles' strong individuale21. In both Pindar and Piato a great, irré- sistible, sovereign force, νόμος and the law of nature respectively, empowers special or chosen individuals, Héraclès and the strong, to use violence to achieve a spécifie end. Callicles suggests that the ben- efits of the stronger include material possessions22 and this is proba- bly the reason why he mentions only the cattle of Geryon, although the theft of the Thracian mares involved even greater violence and would thus suit his purpose equally well or better23: the monstrous 21. It should also be pointed out, though, that Piato may hâve intended the quotation as an indication of rhetorical or literary lack of sophistication on Cal- licles' part. Even without misquoting Pindar and even appealing to a prominent aspect of Pindar's poem Callicles does misinterpret, or at least overinterpret, Pindar's poem. The fact that Socrates does not dispute Callicles' interprétation does not imply that he accepts it. Grote (above, n. 3), 28, is right: irony is equally or more effective when not made obvious. 22. A little later (490b-491b) Socrates will exploit mercilessly and comically this suggestion by presenting Callicles' superman, defined as the expert in a field, as hankering after more food, drink and clothes than the rest of the Citizens. Calli- cles protests but it is undeniable that his strong individuals enjoy material advan- tages too even if he claims that their primary goal is the acquisition of politicai power (491c-d). 23. Similarly, Herodotus quotes only thè first line of the poem without other</page><page sequence="11">The violence of nomos in Pindar fr. 169a 205 mares conferred no obvious material advantage while the cattle of Geryon definitely did. To sum up, since δικαιω does not refer to justice and Zeus is not mentioned in the fragment, νόμος is the only avenue through which Pindar may hâve suggested justice. As indicated above, this is not particularly probable: a power that authorizes the use of treachery and violence against legitimate owners of stolen property can hardly promote justice. Demos (above, n. 3, 56), for instance, has claimed that νόμος acts like a just king. Paradigmatic just kings are found in Homer and Hesiod, adjudicating disputes, upholding justice and naturally avoiding violence (Od. 19.109-114; Th. 81-92; Op. 225- 247). Pindar's νόμος, fate or custom hâve no such function. Νόμος could at most be thought of as a «tyrant of men», as Hippias claims in Prot. 337d2, although he too deals like Callicles with the law vs. nature antithesis. The justification of injustice involves the reversai or annulment of the previous, the traditional code of justice that re- jects the use of violence against non-aggressors. If the previous or traditional code remains in effect, and everybody agrées that it does, there can be no justification of violence. If the sovereign νόμος arbi- trarily decrees that unprovoked violence and treachery are just, the concept of justice becomes void. If nobody believes that unpro- voked violence is just and since the sovereign νόμος does not require justification, violence can be and is used but cannot be and is not justified. It is not impossible of course that somewhere in the lost part of the poem, perhaps at the end, Pindar mentioned justice or the justice of Zeus24 and that this supposed référence to justice has not found its way in later authors. What is important to us, though, is that the extant fragment contains no such référence and it cannot be confidently inferred from the context of the quotation or from the interprétation of the fragment by later authors. Why Pindar chose to cali the sovereign power of the introductory gnome νόμος is an intriguing but not necessarily answerable ques- tion. Lloyd-Jones (above, n. 3, 164) suggested that «as the polis de- veloped, law and law-abidingness acquired a special sanctity». An- other plausible hypothesis is that Pindar shunned the identification of the all-powerful and all-pervasive νόμος with fate or the Fates be- cause he wished to avoid even thè remote possibility of a potential altering of the course of fate - Apollo, after all, did manage to trick the Fates once (Eur. Ale. 10-14 and 32-34). Pindar's choiee of term spécifications because obviously the rule of νόμος over the gods and especially the use of violence is irrelevant to his discussion. 24. This tenuous possibility is sometimes even 'read* into the text; Grote, (above, n. 3) 30, for instance, states as a fact that «... Héraclès is justified in the end and his deeds are reconciled with justice».</page><page sequence="12">206 Poulheria Kyriakou may also hâve been influencée! by the poetical topos of the juxtapo- sition of justice and violence found e.g. in Hesiod's admonitions to his brother {Op. 276-280)25. The delinquent Perses is urged to follow the ways of Justice and shun violence because Zeus gave a différent νόμος to humans and animais: in contrast to the latter, which devour one another, humans live by justice. While a Pindaric allusion to this Hesiodic model appears prima facie to support the case of those who see the justice of Zeus in Pindar's νόμος, it should be kept in mind that in Hesiod νόμος without spécifications is not a concept automatically associated with justice (cf. e.g. Op. 388). This semantic latitude may hâve facilitated the Pindaric «borrowing». If Pindar had Hesiod in mind, he broadened the jurisdiction of νόμος to in- clude the gods but also dissociated νόμος from Zeus and justice stressing its freedom to prescribe the use of extreme violence. These modifications may hâve been meant to turn the Hesiodic équations on their head: taking his eue from stories where animais devour hu- mans and humans feed humans to animais in order to trick others and steal their property, Pindar may hâve meant to suggest that the most salient characteristic of thè ultimate authority is violence and not justice. This universal authority, νόμος, is a sovereign ordinance, a norm that everybody has to obey and a fate that nobody can es- cape. The traditional division of men into just and violent becomes a division into those empowered by νόμος to use violence and those forced to suffer it, irrespective of their status and nature. This is a quite harsh and somber outlook but not markedly at odds with views expressed in other poems. Νόμος and the justice of Zeus or Héraclès in his capacity as a punisher of evil and a benefactor of mankind are not aîways mutually exclusive. In fr. 169a Pindar sug- gested that, on some occasions at least, νόμος reserves the right to enforce the use of extreme violence and to overrule justice. DemoaitHS University, Greece 25.
